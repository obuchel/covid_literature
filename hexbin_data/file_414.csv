3471,A Comprehensive In Silico Method to Study the QSTR of the Aconitine Alkaloids for Designing Novel Drugs,2018-09-18,"A combined in silico method was developed to predict potential protein targets that are involved in cardiotoxicity induced by aconitine alkaloids and to study the quantitative structure–toxicity relationship (QSTR) of these compounds. For the prediction research, a Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network was built from the extraction of useful information about protein interactions connected with aconitine cardiotoxicity, based on nearly a decade of literature and the STRING database. The software Cytoscape and the PharmMapper server were utilized to screen for essential proteins in the constructed network. The Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase II alpha (CAMK2A) and gamma (CAMK2G) were identified as potential targets. To obtain a deeper insight on the relationship between the toxicity and the structure of aconitine alkaloids, the present study utilized QSAR models built in Sybyl software that possess internal robustness and external high predictions. The molecular dynamics simulation carried out here have demonstrated that aconitine alkaloids possess binding stability for the receptor CAMK2G. In conclusion, this comprehensive method will serve as a tool for following a structural modification of the aconitine alkaloids and lead to a better insight into the cardiotoxicity induced by the compounds that have similar structures to its derivatives.","Wang, Ming-Yang; Liang, Jing-Wei; Mohamed Olounfeh, Kamara; Sun, Qi; Zhao, Nan; Meng, Fan-Hao",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6225272/,414
4393,A Single Cell but Many Different Transcripts: A Journey into the World of Long Non-Coding RNAs,2020-01-01,"In late 2012 it was evidenced that most of the human genome is transcribed but only a small percentage of the transcripts are translated. This observation supported the importance of non-coding RNAs and it was confirmed in several organisms. The most abundant non-translated transcripts are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). In contrast to protein-coding RNAs, they show a more cell-specific expression. To understand the function of lncRNAs, it is fundamental to investigate in which cells they are preferentially expressed and to detect their subcellular localization. Recent improvements of techniques that localize single RNA molecules in tissues like single-cell RNA sequencing and fluorescence amplification methods have given a considerable boost in the knowledge of the lncRNA functions. In recent years, single-cell transcription variability was associated with non-coding RNA expression, revealing this class of RNAs as important transcripts in the cell lineage specification. The purpose of this review is to collect updated information about lncRNA classification and new findings on their function derived from single-cell analysis. We also retained useful for all researchers to describe the methods available for single-cell analysis and the databases collecting single-cell and lncRNA data. Tables are included to schematize, describe, and compare exposed concepts.","Alessio, Enrico; Bonadio, Raphael Severino; Buson, Lisa; Chemello, Francesco; Cagnin, Stefano",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6982300/,414
17599,Convergence of a common solution for broad ebolavirus neutralization by glycan cap-directed human antibodies,2021-04-13,"Recent advances in the diagnosis and management of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have led to a significant improvement in the outcomes for patients with PAH. However, prompt and accurate diagnosis of PAH remains an unmet challenge due to lack of awareness and lack of meticulous data to profile the etiology and pathophysiology of this rare progressive disease, especially in low- and middle-income country. In Indonesia, the true prevalence and incidence of different subtypes of PAH in general population is still unknown. The Congenital HeARt Disease in adult and Pulmonary Hypertension (COHARD-PH) registry was the first single-center prospective registry in Indonesia, which indicated that almost 80% of adult patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) had experienced PAH and even Eisenmenger syndrome due to delayed diagnosis. Screening for early detection of asymptomatic CHD in children is yet to be systematically established in Indonesia, leading to undiagnosed and uncorrected CHD in adulthood. There are no specific national guidelines focusing on diagnostic workup and treatment of PAH in Indonesia. Furthermore, the lack of adequate diagnostic facilities, limited treatment availability, and limited drug coverage under the National Health Insurance Scheme are key issues that remain unaddressed. This review focuses on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of PAH associated with CHD in Indonesia as per international guidelines. We have proposed recommendations to effectively control and prevent PAH associated with CHD in Indonesia. The paper should be of interest to readers in the area of medical management and policy makers especially in low- and middle-income countries. KEY HIGHLIGHTS: 1. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare progressive subtype of pulmonary hypertension with poor overall prognosis and outcomes. 2. Prompt and accurate diagnosis of PAH remains an unmet challenge in low- and middle-income countries due to poor knowledge about the etiology and pathophysiology of this syndrome. Also, the symptoms and signs of early-stage PAH are usually nonspecific or undetectable in newborn and infants, thus presenting a challenge for physicians to establish early diagnoses of PAH. 3. The challenging factors in low- and middle-income countries, especially Indonesia archipelago are limitations of healthcare infrastructure, limited expertise, lack of awareness, lack of timely PAH screening strategies, poor antenatal care and unpredictable availability of PAH medications. 4. There are no specific national guidelines focusing on diagnostic workup and treatment of PAH in Indonesia. Under-utilization of treatment guidelines and lack of adequate diagnostic treatment facilities have resulted in sub-optimal management of PAH patients in Indonesia. 5. Adherence to international guidelines is an important aspect of PAH management in Indonesia. Updated disease and functional classifications of PAH as per international guidelines along with new research findings on prognostic factors can help in making better management decisions for PAH patients at different stages of the disease.","Dinarti, Lucia Kris; Anggrahini, Dyah Wulan; Lilyasari, Oktavia; Siswanto, Bambang Budi; Hartopo, Anggoro Budi",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8064285/,414

43563,Simple and Visible Detection of Novel Astroviruses Causing Fatal Gout in Goslings Using One-Step Reverse Transcription Polymerase Spiral Reaction Method,2020-12-10,"In recent months, older adults have faced great health risks due to COVID-19, yet social distancing measures may also heighten risks to their social well-being. This mixed methods study explores changes in older adults’ social support satisfaction and interpersonal connections across the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. A Midwestern sample of 70 older adults aged 70-97 completed two phone interviews (April and June 2020) about their experiences with social distancing due to COVID-19. At both timepoints participants rated their satisfaction with social support and responded to open-ended questions about their interpersonal interactions, communication, and support in current daily life. Mean social support satisfaction significantly increased between the two interviews. Ensuing analysis of qualitative responses suggested this shift could reflect psychological adjustment to the circumstances or adaptation in methods of interpersonal connection over time. Emergent themes included: 1) increased family support and strain, 2) adaptable and flexible friendships, 3) isolation fatigue, and 4) communication through technology. Evaluation of change over time indicated divergent and shifting perceptions of social support as the pandemic endures. Findings suggest nuanced and diverse social support experiences amongst older adults, yet general patterns of initial shock to social support systems that subsided or adapted over time. Future research should build upon these findings to better understand older adults’ social support needs and seek to explore ways to best foster social connections during instances of forced social isolation or societal crises such as the current and ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic.","Fuller, Heather; Huseth-Zosel, Andrea; Sturn, Emily; Carlson, Shawn; Hofmann, Brittany; Kinkade, Emily; Van Vleet, Bryce",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7742066/,414
46252,Computational guided approach for drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2,2021-03-02,"Viral outbreaks are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in livestock and human populations. Lack of good vaccines and poor control measures along with natural viral genetic drifting and shifting are the common causes of new viral strains and outbreaks. The current study reports the synthesis of some 2-aryl substituted thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acids 1a-h and their 3-acetyl 2a and 3-benzoyl derivatives 3a. Two important poultry viruses: Avian influenza virus (AIV; A/Chicken/Italy/1994/H9N2) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were selected, grown in ‎9-11 days old chicken embryonated eggs‎, and subjected to in ovo anti-viral assays. Most of the synthesized compounds were found active against AIV subtype H9N2 and IBV. In the case of AIV, the best results were attained for compound 1d which showed an IC(50) value of 3.47 µM, while IBV 1c showed IC(50 )value of 4.10 µM. The lower IC(50) values of these compounds correlate with the high potency of these compounds, especially in comparison with control groups. The standard drugs amantadine and ribavarin were used as positive controls in the case of AIV and IBV, respectively. Better results were obtained with 2-aryl substituted thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acids 1a-h compared to their N-acylated derivatives 2a and 3a against both viruses. In conclusion, this preliminary data support the idea that thiazolidine carboxylic acids could be used as anti-viral drugs against AIV and IBV infections.","Musaddiq, Sara; Imran Shahzad, Mirza; Firdous, Farzana; Iqbal, Atia; Tanveer, Mehwish; Ashraf, Abida; Aslam, Samina; Khakwani, Samia",Vet Res Forum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7904115/,414

55044,A Virtual Docking Screen at 23 SARS‐CoV‐2 Proteins Identifies Drug Repurposing Candidates at New Sites and Targets,2021-05-14,"The push for non-thermal food processing methods has emerged due to the challenges associated with thermal food processing methods, for instance, high operational costs and alteration of food nutrient components. Non-thermal food processing involves methods where the food materials receive microbiological inactivation without or with little direct application of heat. Besides being well established in scientific literature, research into non-thermal food processing technologies are constantly on the rise as applied to a wide range of food products. Due to such remarkable progress by scientists and researchers, there is need for continuous synthesis of relevant scientific literature for the benefit of all actors in the agro-food value chain, most importantly the food processors, and to supplement existing information. This review, therefore, aimed to provide a technological update on some selected non-thermal food processing methods specifically focused on their operational mechanisms, their effectiveness in preserving various kinds of foods, as revealed by their pros (merits) and cons (demerits). Specifically, pulsed electric field, pulsed light, ultraviolet radiation, high-pressure processing, non-thermal (cold) plasma, ozone treatment, ionizing radiation, and ultrasound were considered. What defines these techniques, their ability to exhibit limited changes in the sensory attributes of food, retain the food nutrient contents, ensure food safety, extend shelf-life, and being eco-friendly were highlighted. Rationalizing the process mechanisms about these specific non-thermal technologies alongside consumer education can help raise awareness prior to any design considerations, improvement of cost-effectiveness, and scaling-up their capacity for industrial-level applications.","Chacha, James S.; Zhang, Liyan; Ofoedu, Chigozie E.; Suleiman, Rashid A.; Dotto, Joachim M.; Roobab, Ume; Agunbiade, Adedoyin O.; Duguma, Haile Tesfaye; Mkojera, Beatha T.; Hossaini, Sayed Mahdi; Rasaq, Waheed A.; Shorstkii, Ivan; Okpala, Charles Odilichukwu R.; Korzeniowska, Malgorzata; Guiné, Raquel P.

55056,SARS‐CoV‐2 Viral Budding and Entry can be Modeled Using BSL‐2 Level Virus‐Like Particles,2021-05-14,"The purpose of this study was: (1) to assess levels of burnout, work-related quality of life (WRQoL) and mental health symptoms among a sample of active workers living in Portugal; (2) to analyze differences in burnout, WRQoL and mental health symptoms by gender and shift work; (3) to analyze association levels among all variables under study; (4) to determine the predictive effect of burnout and WRQoL on mental health symptoms; and (5) to assess the mediating effect of burnout on the association between WRQoL and mental health symptoms. Eight-hundred and forty-one Portuguese active workers between 18 and 67 years of age participated in this study (Mean = 37.23; SD = 11.99). Results showed that women participants scored higher in burnout and mental health symptoms, and lower in overall WRQoL, than men; additionally, participants who worked in shifts presented higher mental health symptoms. Significant correlations were found for all variables and regression analysis demonstrated that 56% of the overall variance of mental health symptoms was explained by older age, shift work, lower WRQoL, and burnout (exhaustion and cognitive impairment). Finally, the mediation effect of burnout on the association between WRQoL and mental health symptoms was statistically significant. These findings are useful for health professionals and health managers who work in the field of occupational health in identifying variables affecting burnout, WRQoL and mental health symptoms.","Pereira, Henrique; Feher, Gergely; Tibold, Antal; Costa, Vítor; Monteiro, Samuel; Esgalhado, Graça",Brain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8235172/,414

60191,Mutation of Asn28 disrupts the dimerization and enzymatic activity of SARS 3CL(pro) .,2010,"In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused one of the most devastating epidemics known to the developed world. There were two important lessons from this epidemic. Firstly, coronaviruses, in addition to influenza viruses, can cause severe and rapidly spreading human infections. Secondly, bats can serve as the origin and natural animal reservoir of deadly human viruses. Since then, researchers around the world, especially those in Asia where SARS-CoV was first identified, have turned their focus to find novel coronaviruses infecting humans, bats, and other animals. Two human coronaviruses, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63, were identified shortly after the SARS-CoV epidemic as common causes of human respiratory tract infections. In 2012, a novel human coronavirus, now called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has emerged in the Middle East to cause fatal human infections in three continents. MERS-CoV human infection is similar to SARS-CoV in having a high fatality rate and the ability to spread from person to person which resulted in secondary cases among close contacts including healthcare workers without travel history to the Middle East. Both viruses also have close relationships with bat coronaviruses. New cases of MERS-CoV infection in humans continue to occur with the origins of the virus still unknown in many cases. A multifaceted approach is necessary to control this evolving MERS-CoV outbreak. Source identification requires detailed epidemiological studies of the infected patients and enhanced surveillance of MERS-CoV or similar coronaviruses in humans and animals. Early diagnosis of infected patients and appropriate infection control measures will limit the spread in hospitals, while social distancing strategies may be necessary to control the outbreak in communities if it remained uncontrolled as in the SARS epidemic.","To, Kelvin K W; Hung, Ivan F N; Chan, Jasper F W; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2013.06.02; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23977429/,414

62177,Computational Insight Into the Mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Membrane Fusion.,2021-01-07,"Emerging wildlife diseases are taking a heavy toll on animal and plant species worldwide. Mitigation, particularly in the initial epidemic phase, is hindered by uncertainty about the epidemiology and management of emerging diseases, but also by vague or poorly defined objectives. Here, we use a quantitative analysis to assess how the decision context of mitigation objectives, available strategies and practical constraints influences the decision of whether and how to respond to epidemics in wildlife. To illustrate our approach, we parametrized the model for European fire salamanders affected by Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, and explored different combinations of conservation, containment and budgetary objectives. We found that in approximately half of those scenarios, host removal strategies perform equal to or worse than no management at all during a local outbreak, particularly where removal cannot exclusively target infected individuals. Moreover, the window for intervention shrinks rapidly if an outbreak is detected late or if a response is delayed. Clearly defining the decision context is, therefore, vital to plan meaningful responses to novel outbreaks. Explicitly stating objectives, strategies and constraints, if possible before an outbreak occurs, avoids wasting precious resources and creating false expectations about what can and cannot be achieved during the epidemic phase.","Bozzuto, Claudio; Schmidt, Benedikt R; Canessa, Stefano",Proceedings.

67851,Inhibiting Ebola virus and SARS-CoV-2 entry.,2020-10-09,"BACKGROUND Low levels of physical activity (PA) and high levels of sedentary behaviour (SB) have been observed in young people. Both behaviours are detrimental for health with patterns tending to continue into adulthood. There is sustained value in establishing health habits in early years. Even though levels of SB and participation in PA differ among boys and girls, and the effectiveness of interventions to promote PA and/or prevent sedentary behaviours varies by sex/gender to date, sex/gender in systematic reviews is not yet widely considered. Additionally, while tools have been proposed, there is no consensus on the criteria to assess sex/gender in systematic reviews in the context of health promotion. The main objectives of this systematic review are to evaluate the effects of interventions on girls' and boys' PA and SB and to appraise the extent to which the studies have taken sex/gender into account. METHODS Eleven electronic databases will be searched to identify all relevant (randomized) controlled trials. Two independent reviewers will screen studies, extract data and appraise the quality of studies. The main outcome of the studies will be a quantified measure of PA and/or SB. Risk of bias of individual studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs. Meta-analyses will be conducted when possible among studies with sufficient homogeneity. To evaluate sex/gender considerations in primary studies, we will use a sex/gender checklist that builds on existing tools and was developed during a 2-day, iterative process among a multidisciplinary panel of 16 experts. The GRADE framework will be used to evaluate evidence across studies for each main efficacy outcome. DISCUSSION To our knowledge, our systematic review will be the first to analyse how sex/gender is considered in interventions promoting PA and/or reducing SB in children and adolescents in detail. The review will provide information on how sex/gender aspects have been considered in recent research and the extent to which sex/gender might impact study outcomes. Our findings will be of interest to stakeholders, health promoters, researchers and policy makers who wish to support more equal outcomes from interventions promoting PA and/or reducing SB.

Given the privileged position nurses occupy within the health care setting, they are often an appropriate health care professional to lead the discharge process. We aimed to map what is currently known about nurse-led/facilitated discharge programs, interventions, models, or frameworks for the pediatric population. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA We conducted a scoping review following the Joanna Briggs Institute Methodology. Published literature targeting children 0-18 years old being discharged from acute care to home and describing a nurse leading the discharge planning/process was included. SAMPLE A search strategy was developed and implemented in four electronic databases; CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science. We also hand searched three high impact journals and reviewed reference lists of relevant articles. This search resulted in 1485 records. Based on our eligibility criteria, 9 articles were included in this review. Two independent reviewers screened each eligible article and extracted relevant information. RESULTS Terminology and program structure varied greatly across included studies. Critical appraisal revealed a lack of high quality research designs. CONCLUSIONS We identified a paucity of nurse-led/facilitated discharge programs evaluated within the pediatric population. The majority of studies were inadequately reported, leaving it difficult to identify development, implementation, and evaluation strategies. IMPLICATIONS Given the positive outcomes reported across all articles included in our review, future empirical research is warranted to explore this role within nursing practice.","Breneol, Sydney; Hatty, Aaron; Bishop, Andrea; Curran, Janet A",Journal of pediatric nursing,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2018.01.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29398316/,414

MATERIAL AND METHODS In 16 sheep, sinus bone augmentation was performed using a synthetic bone graft material according to the methods described by Haas et al (Clinical Oral Implants Research, 9, 1998, 107; Clinical Oral Implants Research, 13, 2002, 396). Another 16 sheep received a sinus floor elevation procedure without graft material. Using a paired design, in one sinus of each animal, a conventional implant was placed, whereas an implant with activated surface was placed in the other. Eight animals of each group were sacrificed at 12 weeks and the others at 26 weeks after surgery. Histological analysis was performed to analyse BIC. Results were statistically compared at a significance level of P < 0.05. RESULTS After 12 weeks, the BIC for conventional and activated implants with or without graft showed comparable results, with mean values of 14.8%, 16.5%, 21.5% and 20.1% (P > 0.05). For ungrafted sinuses after 26 weeks, no increase in BIC was recorded (12.1% conventional surface, 15.8% activated surface; P > 0.05). In grafted sinuses after 26 weeks, mean values increased to 28.7% for conventional and 34.1% for activated implants (P = 0.014; P = 0.015). However, only BIC of the latter was statistically significantly higher compared with ungrafted sinuses (P = 0.038). CONCLUSION After 12 weeks of healing, neither grafting nor implant type seemed to influence BIC. Use of an activated implant surface did not increase BIC when compared with a conventional implant. The synthetic graft seemed to improve BIC values after 26 weeks.","Philipp, Alexander; Duncan, Warwick; Roos, Malgorzata; Hämmerle, Christoph H; Attin, Thomas; Schmidlin, Patrick R",Clinical oral implants research,https://doi.org/10.1111/clr.12255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24112524/,414
82824,SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines and the Growing Threat of Viral Variants.,2021-01-28,"INTRODUCTION Vision impairment and eye disease are major global health concerns and have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and lower quality of life. Quality of life, whether generic, vision-specific or disease-specific, is an important measure of the impact of eye health on people's daily activities, well-being and visual function, and is increasingly used to evaluate the impact of ophthalmic interventions and new devices. While many studies and reviews have examined the relationship between vision or eye health and quality of life across different contexts, there has yet to be a synthesis of the impact of vision impairment, eye disease and ophthalmic interventions on quality of life globally and across the lifespan. METHODS AND ANALYSIS An umbrella review of systematic reviews will be conducted to address these two questions: (1) What is the association of vision impairment and eye disease with quality of life? (2) What is the impact of ophthalmic interventions on quality of life? A search of related literature will be performed on the 11 February 2020 in Medline Ovid, Embase.com, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Proquest Dissertations and Theses Global, and the grey literature, and repeated at the synthesis stage. Title/abstract and full-text screening, methodological quality assessment and data extraction will be conducted by reviewers working independently and in duplicate. Assessment of methodological quality and data extraction will be performed using Joanna Briggs Institute standard forms. Findings from the systematic reviews and their methodological quality will be summarised qualitatively in the text and using tables. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No ethical approval is required. Results of this umbrella review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and summarised in the Lancet Global Health Commission on Global Eye Health.

89938,[RNA polymerase: The Achilles heel of SARS-CoV-2].,2021-03-01,"INTRODUCTION In 2020, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a pandemic. As of August 11, 2020, the cumulative number of confirmed cases worldwide had reached 19 million, with 700,000 reported deaths, indicating this pandemic's significant global impact. AREAS COVERED We reviewed the application of rehabilitation therapy in the clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients. A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Springer, CNKI, and Wanfang Data of database up to August 1, 2020. The search terms included the English terms and their Chinese equivalents: ""COVID-19,"" ""ARDS,"" ""rehabilitation,"" ""critically ill patients,"" ""physiotherapy,"" ""respiratory rehabilitation,"" ""traditional Chinese medicine,"" and ""psychotherapy."" EXPERT OPINION Rehabilitation research concerning patients with COVID-19 remains ongoing. Rehabilitation guidance for such patients with COVID-19 is based on previous experience. However, as different patients have differing degrees of dysfunction, personalized plans need to be designed according to the patients' age, sex, lifestyle, hobbies, occupation, and physical conditions. The rapid development of remote devices that can monitor patients' real-time physical conditions post-discharge may encourage better adherence to rehabilitation training.","Sun, Tiantian; Guo, Liyun; Tian, Fei; Dai, Tiantian; Xing, Xiaohong; Zhao, Junqing; Li, Qiang",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2020.1811687; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32799694/,414
90190,The Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Papain-like Protease: Its Relationship with Recent Coronavirus Epidemics.,2020-09-09,"CAGE-B and SAGE-B scores, consisting of age and fibrotic burden as cirrhosis and/or liver stiffness, were recently proposed to predict hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk among Caucasian chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients undergoing long-term antiviral therapy. We externally validated their predictive performances among an independent cohort from Asia, compared to other conventional prediction models. We consecutively recruited CHB patients with well-controlled viremia (serum HBV-DNA<2,000 IU/ml) receiving antiviral therapy. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis or HCC at baseline were excluded. Among 1763 patients, CAGE-B score provided the highest Heagerty's integrated area under the curve (iAUC) (0.820), followed by SAGE-B (0.804), mREACH-B (0.800), CAMD (0.786), mPAGE-B (0.748), and PAGE-B (0.721) scores. CAGE-B score showed a significantly better performance than SAGE-B, CAMD, PAGE-B, and mPAGE-B scores, but was similar to mREACH-B. SAGE-B score also showed significantly better performance than mPAGE-B and PAGE-B, but was similar to CAMD and mREACH-B. According to CAGE-B score 0~5, 6~10, and ≥11, the annual HCC incidences were 0.18, 1.34, and 6.03 per 100 person-years, respectively (all p<0.001 between each pair). Likewise, by SAGE-B score 0~5, 6~10, and ≥11, those were 0.31, 1.49, and 8.96 per 100 person-years, respectively (all p<0.001 between each pair). Hence CAGE-B and SAGE-B scores showed acceptable predictive performances for Asian CHB patients undergoing antiviral therapy, with the higher performance by CAGE-B score. They show a trend toward better prognostic capability to predict HCC risk than previous models.","Ji, Jung Hyun; Park, Soo Young; Son, Won Jeong; Shin, Hye Jung; Lee, Hyein; Lee, Hye Won; Lee, Jae Seung; Kim, Seung Up; Park, Jun Yong; Kim, Do Young; Ahn, Sang Hoon; Kim, Beom Kyung",Journal of viral hepatitis,https://doi.org/10.1111/jvh.13506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763928/,414

Emerging reports suggest that susceptibility and mortality rates are higher in patients with certain comorbidities when compared to the average population. Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are important risk factors for a lethal outcome of COVID-19. Extensive research ensuing the outbreak of coronavirus-related severe acute respiratory syndrome in the year 2003, and COVID-19 recently revealed a role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components in the entry of coronavirus wherein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) had garnered the significant attention. This raises the question whether the use of RAS inhibitors, the backbone of treatment of cardiovascular, neurovascular, and kidney diseases could increase the susceptibility for coronavirus infection or unfortunate outcomes of COVID-19. Thus, currently, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effects of RAS inhibitors in such patients. Moreover, expert bodies like American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and so on have now released official statements that RAS inhibitors must be continued, unless suggested otherwise by a physician. In this brief review, we will elaborate on the role of RAS and ACE2 in pathogenesis of COVID-19. Moreover, we will discuss the potential effect of the use and disuse of RAS inhibitors in patients having COVID-19 with cardiometabolic comorbidities.","Sankrityayan, Himanshu; Kale, Ajinath; Sharma, Nisha; Anders, Hans-Joachim; Gaikwad, Anil Bhanudas",Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1177/1074248420921720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32351121/,414
100595,Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?,2020-02-29,"Almost half of the deaths worldwide caused by tuberculosis in 2018 occurred in the World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Region, home to around a quarter of the global population. Maintaining robust progress in this region is therefore essential if the global goal of ending the tuberculosis epidemic is to be realized. Substantial gains have been made in the region, but the threat to health worldwide posed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic includes not only the direct effects of the pandemic but also the potential eclipsing of the global tuberculosis emergency. The results of modelling studies present stark warnings of a reversal of years of progress and a significant resurgence in deaths from tuberculosis. The COVID-19 pandemic has had variable impacts in the WHO South-East Asia Region to date, but in the countries most affected there has been targeted diversion and repurposing of tuberculosis services, health-care workers and diagnostic equipment. The combined effects of COVID-19, containment measures and fragmentation of tuberculosis services have resulted in delays in diagnosis or non-diagnosis and disruption in treatment resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, transmission and drug resistance. Countries of the region have made attempts to ensure continuity of services and civil society and nongovernmental organizations have instituted a range of innovative mechanisms to support national programmes. However, a comprehensive approach - including scaling up successful initiatives, empowering community leadership, harnessing digital tools, and implementing easily accessible cash transfers and nutrition support - will be critical to success. As COVID-19 recedes, countries will need ""catch-up plans"" to deploy supplementary measures to address the increased tuberculosis burden. Urgent, targeted and agile responses have the potential to mitigate and reverse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tuberculosis in South-East Asia.","Bhatia, Vineet; Mandal, Partha Pratim; Satyanarayana, Srinath; Aditama, Tjandra Yoga; Sharma, Mukta",WHO South-East Asia journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.4103/2224-3151.294300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32978339/,414

To predict how far and fast the disease would spread across Hungary and to support the epidemiological decision-making process, a multidisciplinary research team performed a large amount of scientific data analysis and mathematical and socioeconomic modeling of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hungary, including modeling the medical resources and capacities, the regional differences, gross domestic product loss, the impact of closing and reopening elementary schools, and the optimal nationwide screening strategy for various virus-spreading scenarios and R metrics. KETLAK prepared 2 extensive reports on the problems identified and suggested solutions, and presented these directly to the National Epidemiological Policy-Making Body. The findings provided crucial data for the government to address critical measures regarding health care capacity, decide on restriction maintenance, change the actual testing strategy, and take regional economic, social, and health differences into account. Hungary managed the first part of the COVID-19 pandemic with low mortality rate. In times of epidemics, the formation of multidisciplinary research groups is essential for policy makers. The establishment, research activity, and participation in decision-making of these groups, such as KETLAK, can serve as a model for other countries, researchers, and policy makers not only in managing the challenges of COVID-19, but in future pandemics as well.","Gombos, Katalin; Herczeg, Róbert; Erőss, Bálint; Kovács, Sándor Zsolt; Uzzoli, Annamária; Nagy, Tamás; Kiss, Szabolcs; Szakács, Zsolt; Imrei, Marcell; Szentesi, Andrea; Nagy, Anikó; Fábián, Attila; Hegyi, Péter; Gyenesei, Attila",Population health management,https://doi.org/10.1089/pop.2020.0159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32882160/,414

These lesions, typically classified as aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms, are being detected more frequently with increased utilization of imaging and have various causes (eg, atherosclerosis, trauma, infection) and complications that may be identified radiologically. Ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging often enable detection of visceral vascular lesions, but angiography is important for further diagnosis and treatment. Endovascular treatment is often the first-line therapy. Endovascular intervention or open surgical repair is necessary for all visceral pseudoaneurysms and is likely indicated for visceral aneurysms 2 cm or more in diameter. Endovascular exclusion of flow can be achieved with coils, stents, and injectable liquids. Techniques include embolization (""sandwich"" or ""sac-packing"" technique), exclusion of flow with luminal stents, and stent-assisted coil embolization. Management often depends on the location and technical feasibility of endovascular repair. Embolization is usually preferred for aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms within solid organs, and the sandwich technique is often used when collateral flow is present. Covered stent placement may be preferred to preserve the parent artery when main visceral vessels are being treated. It is usually tailored to lesion location, and a cure can often be effected while preserving end-organ arterial flow. Posttreatment follow-up is usually based on treatment location, modality accuracy, and potential consequences of treatment failure. Follow-up imaging may help identify vessel recanalization, unintended thrombosis of an artery or end organ, or sequelae of nontarget embolization. Retreatment is usually warranted if the clinical risks for which embolization was performed are still present.","Jesinger, Robert A; Thoreson, Andrew A; Lamba, Ramit","Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1148/rg.333115036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23674782/,414

METHODS We estimated the actual number of COVID-19 cases using the reported number of deaths in Brazil and each state, and the expected case-fatality ratio from the World Health Organization. Brazil's expected case-fatality ratio was also adjusted by the population's age pyramid. Therefore, the notification rate can be defined as the number of confirmed cases (notified by the Ministry of Health) divided by the number of expected cases (estimated from the number of deaths). RESULTS The reporting rate for COVID-19 in Brazil was estimated at 9.2% (95%CI 8.8% - 9.5%), with all the states presenting rates below 30%. São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the most populated states in Brazil, showed small reporting rates (8.9% and 7.2%, respectively). The highest reporting rate occurred in Roraima (31.7%) and the lowest in Paraiba (3.4%). CONCLUSION The results indicated that the reporting of confirmed cases in Brazil is much lower as compared to other countries we analyzed. Therefore, decision-makers, including the government, fail to know the actual dimension of the pandemic, which may interfere with the determination of control measures.","Prado, Marcelo Freitas do; Antunes, Bianca Brandão de Paula; Bastos, Leonardo Dos Santos Lourenço; Peres, Igor Tona; Silva, Amanda de Araújo Batista da; Dantas, Leila Figueiredo; Baião, Fernanda Araújo; Maçaira, Paula; Hamacher, Silvio; Bozza, Fernando Augusto",Revista Brasileira de terapia intensiva,https://doi.org/10.5935/0103-507x.20200030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609286/,414

Acute sudden anosmia may precede symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath. Also, hypo/anosmia may be the only symptom of mild COVID-19. European, American and domestic associations of otorhinolaryngologists warn that, these patients may be hidden carriers that contribute to the spread of COVID-19 infection, because they have no indications for testing for the virus and self-isolation. Including anosmia in the criteria for self-isolation can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection. In addition, it would signal the medical staff to use full personal protection when dealing with these patients and help reduce the number of infected doctors. It is known that olfactory disorders can be conductive, perceptual or mixed. Olfactory disturbances in COVID-19 are most likely of a perceptual nature. Although, at the moment, there is insufficient data to determine the exact mechanisms of the onset of anosmia in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, however, there are studies that confirm these or those theories.

Here, random mutagenesis and DNA shuffling of the single-chain variable fragment of the neutralizing antibody 80R followed by bacterial display screening using anchored periplasmic expression (APEx) were used to generate a number of higher-affinity variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-neutralizing antibody 80R with equilibrium dissociation constants (K(D)) as low as 37 pM, a >270-fold improvement relative to that of the parental 80R single-chain variable fragment (scFv). As expected, antigen affinity was shown to correlate directly with neutralization potency toward the icUrbani strain of SARS-CoV. Additionally, the highest-affinity antibody fragment displayed 10-fold-increased broad neutralization in vitro and completely protected against several SARS-CoV strains containing substitutions associated with antibody escape. Importantly, higher affinity also led to the suppression of viral escape mutants in vitro. Escape from the highest-affinity variant required reduced selective pressure and multiple substitutions in the binding epitope. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that engineered antibodies with picomolar dissociation constants for a neutralizing epitope can confer escape-resistant protection.","Rani, Mridula; Bolles, Meagan; Donaldson, Eric F; Van Blarcom, Thomas; Baric, Ralph; Iverson, Brent; Georgiou, George",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00233-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22696652/,414

Two factors, i.e., feature selection and parameter setting, have shown great influence on the efficiency and accuracy of SVM classification. In this study, according to the principles of a genetic algorithm (GA) and SVM, we developed a GA-SVM program and applied it to human cytochrome P450s (CYP450s), which are important monooxygenases in phase I drug metabolism. The program optimizes features and parameters simultaneously, and hence fewer features are used and the overall prediction accuracy is improved. We focus on the mutation of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in protein sequences that appear to exhibit significant influences on drug metabolism. The final predictive model has a quite satisfactory performance, with the prediction accuracy of 61% and cross-validation accuracy of 73%. The results indicate that the GA-SVM program is a powerful tool in optimizing mutation predictive models of nsSNPs of human CYP450s.","Yao, Yu; Zhang, Tao; Xiong, Yi; Li, Li; Huo, Juan; Wei, Dong-Qing",Biotechnology journal,https://doi.org/10.1002/biot.201000450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21721128/,414

With the use of continuously compiled data, we reviewed the role and drawbacks of stent-assisted coiling. MATERIALS AND METHODS We compiled data from consecutive patients from 2003-2012 who underwent coiling, with or without stent assistance. Clinical and angiographic results were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS Of 1815 saccular aneurysms in 1505 patients, 323 (17.8%) were treated with stents (299 procedures) and 1492 (82.2%) without stents (1400 procedures). Procedure-related complications occurred in 9.4% with stents versus 5.6% without stents (P = .016, relative risk 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.7). Ischemic complications were more frequent in the stent group than in the no-stent group (7.0% versus 3.5%; P = .005; relative risk, 1.7; 95% CI 1.2-2.5), as were hemorrhagic complications (2.3% versus 1.9%, P = .64). Procedure-induced mortality occurred in 2.7% (8/299) with stents versus 1.1% (15/1400) without stents (P = .029; relative risk, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.5). Logistic regression analysis identified wide-neck aneurysms as the most significant independent predictor of complications. A total of 64.1% (207/323) of aneurysms treated with stents and 70.3% (1049/1492) treated without stents have been followed, disclosing angiographic recurrence in 15.5% (32/207) versus 35.5% (372/1049), respectively (P < .0001). Logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of a stent was the most important factor for the reduction of angiographic recurrence (P < .0001; relative risk, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.6-3.3). CONCLUSIONS The stent-assisted coiling technique is associated with a significant decrease in recurrences but a significant increase in complications.

DESIGN A systematic review and meta-analysis calculating relative risk ratios, fall rate ratio and absolute weighted mean difference using random effects models. Heterogeneity was estimated using I2 statistics, and the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool and the GRADE approach were used to evaluate quality of evidence and summarise conclusions. DATA SOURCES The databases PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register from inception to April 2016 and reference lists of retrieved publications. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Randomised controlled trials examining the effect of WBV on fracture risk in adults ≥50 years of age. The primary outcomes were fractures, fall rates and the proportion of participants who fell. Secondary outcomes were bone mineral density (BMD), bone microarchitecture, bone turnover markers and calcaneal broadband attenuation (BUA). RESULTS 15 papers (14 trials) met the inclusion criteria. Only one study had fracture data reporting a non-significant fracture reduction (risk ratio (RR)=0.47, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.57, P=0.22) (moderate quality of evidence). Four studies (n=746) showed that WBV reduced the rate of falls with a rate ratio of 0.67 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.89, P=0.0006; I2=19%) (moderate quality of evidence). Furthermore, data from three studies (n=805) found a trend towards falls reduction (RR=0.76, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.20, P=0.24; I2=24%) (low quality of evidence). Finally, moderate to low quality of evidence showed no overall effect on BMD and only sparse data were available regarding microarchitecture parameters, bone turnover markers and BUA. CONCLUSIONS WBV reduces fall rate but seems to have no overall effect on BMD or microarchitecture. The impact of WBV on fractures requires further larger adequately powered studies. This meta-analysis suggests that WBV may prevent fractures by reducing falls.

131029,TLR2 senses the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein to produce inflammatory cytokines.,2021-05-07,"INTRODUCTION Although calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) is common, there are no published outcome domains or validated measurement instruments for CPPD studies. In this paper, we describe the framework for development of the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) CPPD Core Domain Sets. METHODS The OMERACT CPPD working group performed a scoping literature review and qualitative interview study. Generated outcomes were presented at the 2020 OMERACT CPPD virtual Special Interest Group (SIG) meeting with discussion focused on whether different core domain sets should be developed for different calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) clinical presentations and how the future CPPD Core Domain Set may overlap with already established osteoarthritis (OA) domains. These discussions informed development of a future work plan for development of the OMERACT CPPD Core Domain Sets. FINDINGS Domains identified from a scoping review of 112 studies and a qualitative interview study of 36 people (28 patients with CPPD, 7 health care professionals, one stakeholder) were mapped to core areas of OMERACT Filter 2.1. The majority of SIG participants agreed there was need to develop separate core domain sets for ""short term"" and ""long term"" studies of CPPD. Although CPPD + OA is common and core domain sets for OA have been established, participants agreed that existing OA core domain sets should not influence the development of OMERACT core domain sets for CPPD. Prioritization exercises (using Delphi methodology) will consider 40 potential domains for short term studies of CPPD and 47 potential domains for long term studies of CPPD. CONCLUSION Separate OMERACT CPPD Core Domain Sets will be developed for ""short term"" studies for an individual flare of acute CPP crystal arthritis and for ""long term"" studies that may include participants with any clinical presentation of CPPD (acute CPP crystal arthritis, chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis, and/or CPPD + OA).","Cai, Ken; Fuller, Amy; Zhang, Yiling; Hensey, Owen; Grossberg, David; Christensen, Robin; Shea, Beverley; Singh, Jasvinder A; McCarthy, Geraldine M; Rosenthal, Ann K; Filippou, Georgios; Taylor, William J; Diaz-Torne, Cesar; Stamp, Lisa K; Edwards, N Lawrence; Pascart, Tristan; Becce, Fabio; Nielsen, Sabrina M; Tugwell, Peter; Beaton, Dorcas; Abhishek, Abhishek; Tedeschi, Sara K; Dalbeth, Nicola",Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semarthrit.2021.04.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140183/,414

The animals were arbitrarily allocated into four groups: group I rats administered a 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) vehicle orally for 15 consecutive days with a single intravenous standard saline injection (0.9% NaCl) on day seven. Groups II, III, and IV were injected intraperitoneally with 20 mg MTX/kg on 7th day. Animals in group III and IV were treated orally for 14 days with 20 mg of SA/kg dissolved daily in 0.5% CMC respectively. In all experimental groups, liver function, biochemical, histopathological and molecular changes were evaluated. MTX-induced changes in liver function indices like ALT, AST, and ALP are substantially restored with SA pretreatment. Moreover, antioxidant defense mechanisms (GSH, SOD, and CAT) and oxidative/nitrostative stress (MDA and NO) and inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-β and MPO) were also substantially restored. Furthermore, the conclusions indicate that SA prevents the hepatic damage caused by MTX through apoptosis inhibition and stimulation of Nrf2/HO-1-medial antioxidant enzymes by NF-κB inhibition. Histological findings have shown that SA therapy has greatly protected liver damage caused by MTX.","Ahmad, Ajaz; Alkharfy, Khalid M; Bin Jardan, Yousef A; Shahid, Mudassar; Ansari, Mushtaq Ahmad; Alqahtani, Saeed; Jan, Basit L; Al-Jenoobi, Fahad I; Raish, Mohammad",Environmental toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1002/tox.23123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720507/,414

MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten patients scheduled for (18)F-FDG PET and contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen were included in this study. PET data were corrected for attenuation using both unenhanced low-dose CT images and contrast-enhanced high-dose CT images. Differences in SUV(mean) and SUV(max) were compared in three liver regions. RESULTS The average SUV(mean) and SUV(max) of all regions were 2.43 and 2.91 g/cm in the unenhanced data set and 2.53 and 3.17 g/cm in the enhanced data set, respectively. CONCLUSION SUV(mean) and SUV(max) were significantly elevated in liver tissue when using PET images corrected for attenuation with contrast-enhanced high-dose CT compared with PET images corrected with unenhanced low-dose CT. Although the differences may not be relevant in daily clinical practice, unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT should not be selected randomly for attenuation correction if exact quantitative results are required.","ter Voert, Edwin E G W; van Laarhoven, Hanneke W M; Kok, Peter J M; Oyen, Wim J G; Visser, Eric P; de Geus-Oei, Lioe-Fee",Nuclear medicine communications,https://doi.org/10.1097/mnm.0000000000000086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509519/,414

To assess whether paid sick leave is available in countries around the world, we created and analysed a database of legislative guarantees of paid leave for personal illness in 193 UN member states. Original labour and social security legislation and global information on social security systems for each country were obtained and analysed by a multilingual research team using a common coding framework. While strong models exist across low- middle- and high-income countries, critical gaps that jeopardise health and economic security remain. 27% of countries do not guarantee paid sick leave from the first day of illness, essential to encouraging workers to stay home when they are sick and prevent spread. 58% of countries do not have explicit provisions to ensure self-employed and gig economy workers have access to paid sick leave benefits. Comprehensive paid sick leave policies that cover all workers are urgently needed if we are to reduce the spread of COVID-19, and be ready to respond to threats from new pathogens.","Heymann, Jody; Raub, Amy; Waisath, Willetta; McCormack, Michael; Weistroffer, Ross; Moreno, Gonzalo; Wong, Elizabeth; Earle, Alison",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2020.1764076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32396447/,414

149405,Stability of classical swine fever virus and pseudorabies virus in animal feed ingredients exposed to transpacific shipping conditions.,2020-01-30,"Bone substitute biomaterials, whose compositions and structures both play vital roles in bone defect healing, hold promising prospects in the clinical treatment of bone defects. Three-dimensional (3D) printed porous scaffolds incorporating osteoinductive components are considered as ideal bone grafts, because of the accurate control of structure parameters and the capacity to enhance bone tissue regeneration. Our previous studies demonstrated that nanoscale zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (nanoZIF-8), a subclass of metal organic frameworks (MOFs), presented minimal cytotoxicity, inhibited bacterial activities, and promoted osteogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. However, the application of nanoZIF-8 in the 3D printed scaffold system remains unknown. In this study, nanoZIF-8 was incorporated into composite scaffolds composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) via extrusion-based 3D printing technology. The results revealed that the composite scaffolds possessed increased mechanical strength and exhibited homogeneous structure with highly interconnected macropores. In vitro studies indicated that scaffolds showed biocompatibility to bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), significantly up-regulated the expression of osteogenesis-related genes and proteins, and facilitated the extracellular matrix mineralization. In vivo results showed that 3D printed porous scaffolds promoted new bone formation and enhanced micro-architecture at the critical defect sites (Φ10 mm) in rabbits, compared with the blank control group. Moreover, composite scaffolds significantly improved calvarial defect healing in comparison with scaffolds without nanoZIF-8 incorporation. In summary, nanoZIF-8 modified 3D printed porous composite scaffolds demonstrated great potential in the treatment of critical-sized bone defects, proving the effectiveness of MOF incorporation in 3D printed composite scaffolds to promote osteogenesis in the field of bone tissue engineering.","Zhong, Linna; Chen, Junyu; Ma, Zhiyong; Feng, Hao; Chen, Song; Cai, He; Xue, Yiyuan; Pei, Xibo; Wang, Jian; Wan, Qianbing",Nanoscale,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0nr06297a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305769/,414
152463,"Susceptibility of turkeys, chickens and chicken embryos to SARS-CoV-2.",2020-12-29,"BACKGROUND The potential for aerosol transmission of infectious influenza virus (ie, in healthcare facilities) is controversial. We constructed a simulated patient examination room that contained coughing and breathing manikins to determine whether coughed influenza was infectious and assessed the effectiveness of an N95 respirator and surgical mask in blocking transmission. METHODS National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health aerosol samplers collected size-fractionated aerosols for 60 minutes at the mouth of the breathing manikin, beside the mouth, and at 3 other locations in the room. Total recovered virus was quantitated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and infectivity was determined by the viral plaque assay and an enhanced infectivity assay. RESULTS Infectious influenza was recovered in all aerosol fractions (5.0% in >4 μm aerodynamic diameter, 75.5% in 1-4 μm, and 19.5% in <1 μm; n = 5). Tightly sealing a mask to the face blocked entry of 94.5% of total virus and 94.8% of infectious virus (n = 3). A tightly sealed respirator blocked 99.8% of total virus and 99.6% of infectious virus (n = 3). A poorly fitted respirator blocked 64.5% of total virus and 66.5% of infectious virus (n = 3). A mask documented to be loosely fitting by a PortaCount fit tester, to simulate how masks are worn by healthcare workers, blocked entry of 68.5% of total virus and 56.6% of infectious virus (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS These results support a role for aerosol transmission and represent the first reported laboratory study of the efficacy of masks and respirators in blocking inhalation of influenza in aerosols. The results indicate that a poorly fitted respirator performs no better than a loosely fitting mask.","Noti, John D; Lindsley, William G; Blachere, Francoise M; Cao, Gang; Kashon, Michael L; Thewlis, Robert E; McMillen, Cynthia M; King, William P; Szalajda, Jonathan V; Beezhold, Donald H",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cis237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22460981/,414
153602,Can SARS-CoV-2 Accumulate Mutations in the S-Protein to Increase Pathogenicity?,2020-10-09,"BACKGROUND Multiple randomized controlled trials have documented the effectiveness of rivaroxaban in the prevention of venous thromboembolism up to 1-month following total joint arthroplasty. However, the effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban in the real-world setting, outside of the strict protocols used by randomized clinical trials, are unknown. METHODS This was a prospective, observational, noninterventional, phase IV study of 3914 consecutive patients who underwent total joint arthroplasty from June 2010 to December 2012. Patients were treated with rivaroxaban 10 mg by mouth daily starting postoperative day 1 and continued for 15 days. Participants were followed up in clinic at 6 weeks and contacted by telephone at 12 weeks. The primary outcome of interest was symptomatic venous thromboembolism; secondary outcomes included bleeding events, transfusion requirements, and death. RESULTS The incidence of symptomatic deep venous thrombosis at 3 months was 0.5% (n = 18). Only 1 deep venous thrombosis event occurred within 7 days of surgery. The incidence of symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) at 3 months was 0.7% (n = 28). Thirteen PEs (46%) occurred within 7 days of surgery. The rate of major bleeding while on prophylaxis was 0.1%. Only 5% of patients received a blood transfusion. No deaths were attributed to thromboembolic events. CONCLUSION This prospective, observational, phase IV study demonstrates that rivaroxaban appears to protect patients against symptomatic PE and is not associated with major bleeding events when used in a real-world setting as described.","Gomez, David; Razmjou, Helen; Donovan, Andrea; Bansal, Vikas B; Gollish, Jeffrey D; Murnaghan, John J",The Journal of arthroplasty,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2016.09.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27843040/,414

In effect, many of the concerns emanating from the relatively weak health infrastructure in Haiti were analyzed from a resilience perspective. Many professionals living in Haiti with whom we have conversed believe that Haitians were better prepared to cope with the social distancing and mental health outcomes associated with the pandemic because of their 3-month exposure to the effects of Peyi Lòk (""country in lockdown"") as well as previous major natural disasters. In that regard, previous traumatic exposures may serve as a buffer against the debilitating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among Haitians. For the past 3 months, Haitians have naturally adopted a practical posture to cope with the pandemic where only school buildings are closed. Consequently, we remain convinced that from a psychological perspective, individuals from high-income countries that are severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic could learn from the Haitian way of coping with large-scale disasters.

165860,Targeted isolation of panels of diverse human broadly neutralizing antibodies against SARS-like viruses,2021-09-08,"Background. Obesity is a leading comorbidity in psoriatic disease, including both psoriasis (Pso) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and is associated with adverse metabolic and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. Anthropometric parameters, such as weight, body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio, have been extensively reported in psoriatic disease. However, the associations of body composition and fat distribution with psoriasis have not been fully defined. Objectives. To identify whether patients with psoriatic disease, including psoriatic arthritis, have altered body composition compared with the general population, and to review existing modalities for the assessment of body composition. Methods. Electronic searches of the literature were conducted in PubMed, Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register and Google Scholar. Titles and abstracts were reviewed by two authors independently against a set of prespecified inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results. Twenty-five full text articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final narrative analysis. The studies were of heterogeneous design and used a range of objective measures to assess body composition, including simple anthropometric measures, bioimpedance analysis (BIA), dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and computed tomography (CT). Few studies met all the quality assessment criteria. Conclusions. Patients with psoriatic disease reveal defined body composition changes that are independent of obesity and the customary metabolic syndrome, including higher overall body fat, visceral fat and sarcopenia. These findings emphasize that patients with psoriatic disease should be screened for abnormal adipose effects beyond their weight and body mass index (BMI). Our findings show that the last decade has seen an exciting expansion of research interest in the development and validation of new modalities for the assessment of body composition. There is no consensus on the optimal assessment method of body composition for this diverse group, hence there is a need for validation of existing modalities and standardization of assessment tools.","Blake, T.; Gullick, N.

We show that expression of a dominant-active form of the Ras oncogene in Drosophila salivary glands (SGs) leads to redistribution of components of the basement membrane (BM) and fibrotic lesions. Similar to several types of mammalian fibrosis, the disturbed BM attracts clot components including insect transglutaminase and phenoloxidase. SG epithelial cells show reduced apico-basal polarity accompanied by a loss of secretory activity. Both the fibrotic lesions and the reduced cell polarity are alleviated by ectopic expression of the antimicrobial peptide Drosomycin (Drs), which also restores secretory activity of the SGs. In addition to ECM components, both Drs and F-actin localize to fibrotic lesions.","Khalili, Dilan; Kalcher, Christina; Baumgartner, Stefan; Theopold, Ulrich",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.19.436168,414
167243,"Safety and Immunogenicity of Nanocovax, a SARS-CoV-2 Recombinant Spike Protein Vaccine",2021-07-25,"Substance use disorders (SUDs) are characterized by a compulsion to seek and consume one or more substances of abuse, with a perceived loss of control and negative emotional state. Repeated use of a substance results in synaptic and morphological changes, secondary to toxicity and SUD pathology in the dopamine striato-thalamo-cortical and limbic pathways. These neuroadaptations seem to vary between studies, which could be related to divergent effects of substances, consumption severity or other unknown factors. We therefore identified studies investigating the effects of SUDs using volumetric whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in gray (GM) and white matter (WM). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of VBM studies using the anatomic likelihood estimation (ALE) method implemented in GingerALE (PROSPERO pre-registration CRD42017071222). Fifty studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the final quantitative meta-analysis, with a total of 538 foci, 88 experiments and 4370 participants. We found convergence and divergence in brain regions and volume effects (higher vs lower volume) in GM and WM depending on the severity of consumption pattern and type of substance. Convergent pathology was evident across substances in GM of the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, putamen, and thalamus, and in WM of the thalamic radiation and internal capsule bundle. Divergent pathology between occasional use (cortical pathology) and addiction (cortical-subcortical pathology) provides evidence of a possible top-down neuroadaptation. Our findings indicate distinctive brain morphometry alterations in SUDs, which may inform our understanding of disease progression and ultimately therapeutic approaches.","Pando-Naude, Victor; Toxto, Sebastian; Fernandez-Lozano, Sofia; Parsons, E.

We examined sexual behaviour in Britain during the initial national ‘lockdown’ (≥23/3/2020) and compared this to the 3 months pre-lockdown.MethodsWe analysed weighted web-panel survey data from a quota-based sample of 6,654 people in Britain. The questionnaire, fielded 29/7–10/8/2020, included questions about sexual activities pre- and during lockdown, and perceived changes in frequency between these timeframes. We used descriptive statistics and multivariable regression to examine independent associations with relationship status, age, gender, and health.ResultsAltogether, 91.2% of sexually-experienced participants reported any sexual activity during lockdown;85.7% reporting ‘in-person’/physical partnered activities. Around half reported no change in frequency of partnered-sex versus pre-lockdown, however, those not cohabiting were more likely than those cohabiting to report changes (75.6% versus 35.1%) – typically declines. Masturbation (62.0%) and virtual/digital activities (54.3%) were less commonly reported during lockdown, although they were more commonly reported in those not cohabiting versus cohabiting (69.2% versus 57.9%, 67.4% versus 46.7%, respectively). Changes in reported frequency of virtual/digital activities were more common (66.4%) than in-person activities, with increases as likely as declines, except for porn use, where twice as many perceived an increase than a decrease. After adjustment, those reporting a decline in sex were more likely to be: non-cohabiting (AOR:1.68,95%CI:1.45–1.95), aged &lt;25 years (AOR:1.99,1.57–2.51), male (AOR:1.17,1.02–1.35), to report depressive/anxiety symptoms (AOR:1.63,1.41–1.89) or COVID symptoms/diagnosis (AOR:1.24,1.01–1.52).ConclusionsMost people reported some form of sex during lockdown and around half had not experienced changes in partnered-sex compared to pre-lockdown. However, considerable differences existed for certain populations (e.g. young people) that may exacerbate, or be exacerbated by, COVID-19’s wider detrimental effects on physical and mental health.

To this end, we propose Meta-MGNN, a novel model for few-shot molecular property prediction. Meta-MGNN applies molecular graph neural network to learn molecular representation and builds a meta-learning framework for model optimization. To exploit unlabeled molecular information and address task heterogeneity of different molecular properties, Meta-MGNN further incorporates molecular structure, attribute based self-supervised modules and self-attentive task weights into the former framework, strengthening the whole learning model.

171893,Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 host cell interactions inferred from transcriptome analyses,2021-07-05,"Background: Pregnant women are usually more susceptible to infection due to typical physiological and mechanical changes, such as increased heart rate, stroke volume and pulmonary residual capacity. The aim of this study was to evaluate an innovative anesthesiologic opioid-free management protocol in symptomatic pregnant women, with COVID-19 and with oxygen therapy, undergoing cesarean delivery with spinal anesthesia. Methods: With the patient in the sitting position, spinal anesthesia was performed at the L1-L2 level. Vertebral level has been identified starting from the sacrum, we counted the laminae in the caudal-to-cephalad direction, which was then marked with a surgical pen. The technique was performed in asepsis, in the subarachnoid space after vision of clear Cephalo-Spinal Fluid (CSF) in the spinal needle 27 Gauge, without letting out the CSF, bupivacaine 0.5% 10 mg, dexmedetomidine 10 μg and dexamethasone 4 mg was injected. Results: During the study period, 40 pregnant women with one or more symptoms and supplemental oxygen (FiO2 35-40%) who underwent cesarean delivery were included in the study. All pregnant women had pain visual analog scale (VAS) &lt;3, and no pregnant women required rescue dose. Adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, shivering, or pruritus were not recorded in any case. After a mean of 2.5 hours from the spinal anesthesia, all the included women had a complete motility of the lower limbs and were able to mobilize independently within 12 hours after delivery. Mean time to first latus was about 8 hours after delivery. Conclusions: Pregnant women in COVID-19 can safely receive intrathecal dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine during planned cesarean delivery. © 2021 The Author(s).

Investors continue to hear about COVID-19 and its impact in one corner of the globe or the other for a long time. Though the effects of COVID19 started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, global markets did not respond actively till W.H.O officially declared on March 11, 2020, that the COVID19 outbreak is a global pandemic. These multi-channel events have eroded investor sentiment, tanking the global stock markets. This article uses a machine learning approach to Twitter to analyze and follow investor sentiment that has guided the market to the new low during the first 150 days of the COVID-19 era.

174348,Effectiveness of Different Cellulose-Based Filtration Materials against Inhalation of SARS-CoV-2-Like Particles,2021,"Purpose: The authors unpack the critical role of rhetoric in developing and justifying the New Zealand (NZ) government's coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown strategy. Design/methodology/approach: Using Green's (2004) theory of rhetorical diffusion, the authors analysed government documents and media releases before, during and after the lockdown to reconstruct the government's rationale. Findings: The blending of kairos (sense of urgency and “right” time to act), ethos (emphasis on “saving lives”), pathos (fear of disruption and death) and selective use of health-based logos (shrinking infection rates), prompted fast initial adoption of the lockdown. However, support for the rhetoric wavered post-lockdown as absence of robust logos became apparent to the public. Research limitations/implications: The authors implicate the role of rhetoric in decision-makers’ ability to successfully elicit support for a new practice under urgency and the right moment to act using emotionalisation and moralisation. The assessment of the NZ government's response strategy provides insights decision-makers could glean in developing policies to tame the virus. Practical implications: This study’s analysis demonstrates the unsustainability of rhetoric in the absence of reliable information. Originality/value: The authors demonstrate the consequences of limited (intermittent) evidence and disregard for accounting/accountability data in public policy decisions under a rhetorical strategy. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bui, B.; Moses, O.; Dumay, J.","Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal",https://doi.org/10.1108/aaaj-08-2020-4890,414

Ophthalmologists worldwide are reporting various ophthalmic manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The most common ocular manifestation is conjunctivitis. Even a rarer complication, retinal vein occlusion may appear in patients with COVID-19. Case presentation. A 52-year-old man was admitted for retinal vein occlusion of the right eye. He had been complaining of blurred vision for several days. A complete clinical and paraclinical evaluation of the patient was performed, in search of associated diseases. The patient tested positive for infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Conclusions. Retinal circulation is a potential site for thromboembolic complications in patients with COVID-19. Ophthalmologists should be aware of this possible association and maintain a high level of suspicion of COVID-19 in patients with vascular occlusive diseases of the eye.","Trifonova, K.

The objec-tive of this research was to examine the spaces used in the practice of leisure shared by grandparents and grandchildren and their link with the geographical area of residence. A cross-sectional telematic survey was carried out in which 357 grandparents with grandchildren between 6 and 12 years of age living in the northern part of Spain participated, and a descriptive study and inferential analysis of the data were carried out. The results revealed that a descriptive and inferential analysis was performed. The preferred space for intergenerational leisure was the home, especially for cultural activities such as board games, watching television, and reading. Associations, municipal spaces (sports centers, cultural centers, playrooms), and educational centers are more frequently used in the inland populations. Residing in urban towns and coastal municipalities implies a greater preference for the use of private leisure spaces. Living in provinces with a wetter, rainy climate is related to more shared leisure practice at home. The possible exceptionality of the current situation, within the framework of COVID-19, which may have led to significant alterations in the grandparent– grandchildren relationship, is discussed, with the consequent need to continue this line of inquiry. © 2021 by the authors.

The denial of the most basic elements of neoliberal fascism appears more difficult in the age of mass pandemics. Neoliberal violence now takes place under the assumption that it has escaped all control. How else to explain the collapse of public health systems underfunded for years as a result of neoliberal rule;the language of hate and violence aimed at people of color, especially under the former Trump administration;and the staggering increase in inequality in American society and its shameless counterpoint in massive increases in wealth among the ruling financial elite in an era of growing unemployment, and humans suffering in the age of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Immediate solutions such as defunding the police and improving community services are important, but they do not deal with the larger issue of eliminating a market-driven economic system structured in massive racial and economic inequalities. The renowned educator David Harvey is right in arguing that the ""immediate task is nothing more nor less than the self-conscious construction of a new political framework for approaching the question of inequality [and racism], through a deep and profound critique of our economic and social system"" (Harvey, 2020). This is a crisis in which different threads of oppression must be understood as part of the general crisis of capitalism. The various protests now evolving internationally at the popular level offer the promise of new global movements for the struggle for popular sovereignty and economic, racial, and social justice. Central to this struggle is the challenge of destroying the neoliberal global order. In the current moment, democracy may be under severe threat and appear frighteningly vulnerable, but with young people and others engaged in uprisings across the globe--inspired, energized, and marching in the streets--the future of a radical democracy is waiting to breathe again.","Giroux, Henry A.",Communication Teacher,https://doi.org/10.1080/17404622.2021.1923772,414

In response to this shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), we have conducted filtration efficiency and pressure drop testing of a range of common materials used for constructing do-it-yourself masks, including an allergen filter, a vacuum bag, a heavy-duty tool wipe, and a standard cotton bandana, as well as a standard 3-ply surgical mask, a medical drape and an industrially available composite filter material. Size-resolved percent penetration of each material by particles with diameters ranging from 25 to 500 nm was measured at three face velocities (0.72 cm s(-1), 4.30 cm s(-1), 13.0 cm s(-1)). The allergen filter performed best, only allowing the penetration of 5% +/- 3% of the 300 nm particles through the material at a face velocity of 13.0 cm s(-1), comparable to human breathing during heavy physical work. In comparison, the surgical mask and the cotton bandana allowed 39 +/- 1% and 51% +/- 1% of the 300 nm particles to pass through at the same face velocity, respectively. According to the calculated filter quality, the best choices for mask construction are the allergen filter, industrial composite filter, and the vacuum bag. Structure and morphology of the materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), image analysis, and thickness measurements to investigate physical characteristics which improve filtration. This study shows that certain household and commercially available materials and combinations can be used in the construction of highly effective face masks.","Mirrielees, J. A.; Chen, B.; Moreno, M.

177571,Role of SARS-CoV-2 in altering the RNA-binding protein and miRNA-directed post-transcriptional regulatory networks in humans,2020,"At least 10,000 species of mammal virus are estimated to have the potential to spread in human populations, but the vast majority are currently circulating in wildlife, largely undescribed and undetected by disease outbreak surveillance 1–3 . In addition, changing climate and land use are already driving geographic range shifts in wildlife, producing novel species assemblages and opportunities for viral sharing between previously isolated species 4, 5 . In some cases, this will inevitably facilitate spillover into humans 6, 7 —a possible mechanistic link between global environmental change and emerging zoonotic disease 8 . Here, we map potential hotspots of viral sharing, using a phylogeographic model of the mammal-virus network, and projections of potential geographic range shifts for 3,139 mammal species under climate change and land use scenarios for the year 2070. Range-shifting mammal species are predicted to aggregate at high elevations, in biodiversity hotspots, and in areas of high human population density in Asia and Africa, driving the novel cross-species transmission of their viruses an estimated 4,000 times. Counter to expectations, holding warming under 2°C within the century does not reduce new viral sharing, due to greater potential range expansions— highlighting the need to invest in surveillance even in a low-warming future. Most projected viral sharing is driven by diverse hyperreservoirs (rodents and bats) and large-bodied predators (carnivores). Because of their unique dispersal capacity, bats account for the majority of novel viral sharing, and are likely to share viruses along evolutionary pathways that could facilitate future emergence in humans. Our findings highlight the urgent need to pair viral surveillance and discovery efforts with biodiversity surveys tracking species’ range shifts, especially in tropical countries that harbor the most emerging zoonoses.","Carlson, Colin J.; Albery, Gregory F.; Merow, Cory; Trisos, Christopher H.; Zipfel, Casey M.; Eskew, Evan A.; Olival, Kevin J.; Ross, Noam; Bansal, Shweta",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.24.918755,414

Medical teachers quickly adapted with synchronous (i.e., online classes), and asynchronous (i.e., video-and other materials-based learning) method of delivering the content to the students. Aim: We aimed to explore the comparative preference of face-to-face lecture, synchronous, and asynchronous learning among Indian undergraduate medical students. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional nation-wide online survey in July–August 2020 with a snowball sampling technique. We collected response from undergraduate medical students who had attended both online classes and video-and other materials-based learning. Preference on the three modes of learning (namely, face-to-face lecture, online synchronous, and asynchronous) was recorded in a 10 point Likert-type scale. Obtained responses were statistically compared by analysis of variance with a P < 0.05 to be statistically significant. Results: A total of 695 (female = 304 (43.74%), male = 391 (56.26%)) entries were analyzed. Overall, traditional face-to-face lecture class was the most preferred method (8.68 ±1.49) followed by asynchronous (6.33 ± 2.22) learning and then online classes (5.22 ± 2.55, P < 0.0001). Perceived attention, interest, scope of learning, and possibility of interaction with the teachers were highest in face-to-face lecture. The scope of taking notes from all three modes was equal but the scope of formative assessment was highest with synchronous learning. The distraction was highest with asynchronous learning. Conclusion: Undergraduate medical students in India prefer to learn by face-to-face lecture while compared with distance delivery via the digital media. Postpandemic blended learning may be planned with the following sequence of importance: Face-to-face lecture >asynchronous >synchronous learning. © 2021 Journal of Nature and Science of Medicine ;Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","Mondal, H.; Mondal, S.; Swain, S.

Facing this critical pandemic, health care workers who are involved in treating these patients are at risk of developing psychological distress. Objectives: To evaluate mental health outcomes among health care workers treating patients exposed to COVID-19. Methods: This cross-sectional study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from health workers in different hospitals using an online questionnaire. Participants were divided in two groups: G1 included participants working in a COVID-19 unit and G2 included those who worked in a normal ward. Participants were asked to complete the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7). The total scores of these measurement tools were interpreted as follows: PHQ-9 normal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14) and severe (15-21) depression;GAD-7 normal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14) and severe (15-21) anxiety. We compared the two groups in terms of psychological distress using a Chi-square test. Results: A total of 155 individuals with a mean age of 31.3 ± 25 years [26-45] and a sex-ratio of 0.3 completed the online questionnaire. Seventy-two participants (46%) worked in a COVID-unit. The mean number of nightshifts per month in the COVID-unit was 9.5 in G1 and 1.3 in G2 respectively. The mean number of work hours per day in the COVID unit was 5 hours in G1, and 0 in G2. G2 participants worked in COVID-units during nightshifts only. An increase in workload compared to the pre-epidemic was noted only in G1. Depression and anxiety scores were higher among participants of G1 compared to G2 (Table 1). The need for psychological support was more frequent in G1 compared to G2 (38% vs 9%;p=0.005). Participants of G1 were diagnosed with depression (9 cases), anxiety (9 cases) and burn-out (3 cases). In G2, 4 participants were diagnosed with anxiety. The prescribed treatments were: antidepressants (5 cases), anxiolytic (10 cases), and psychotherapy (12 cases). Conclusion: Individuals experience varying levels of distress during pandemics. In our study, health care workers in the frontline of COVID-units experienced high levels of anxiety and depression. Thus, necessary measures should be attached to psychological support strategies for health care workers.","Ben Abdelghani, K.; Hamdi, O.; Miladi, S.; Sellami, M.; Ouenniche, K.; Souabni, L.; Kassab, S.; Chekili, S.; Fazaa, A.; Laatar, A.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.789,414

We interrogated their function during virus-induced lung injury using the highly prevalent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) which causes severe outcomes in infants. We applied complementary approaches with primary pediatric LR-MSCs and a state-of-the-art model of human RSV infection in lamb. Remarkably, RSV-infection of pediatric LR-MSCs led to a robust activation, characterized by a strong antiviral and pro-inflammatory phenotype combined with mediators related to T cell function. In line with this, following in vivo infection, RSV invades and activates LR-MSCs, resulting in the expansion of the pulmonary MSC pool. Moreover, the global transcriptional response of LR-MSCs appears to follow RSV disease, switching from an early antiviral signature to repair mechanisms including differentiation, tissue remodeling, and angiogenesis. These findings demonstrate the involvement of LR-MSCs during virus-mediated acute lung injury and may have therapeutic implications.

We recovered bibliographic antecedents that allowed us to historicize the field and elaborate a classification scheme of the paradigms and approaches in dispute. We identify a verticalist, hegemonic paradigm, with two different approaches, hygienist and behavioral, and a democratic paradigm that also contains two approaches, the socioecological and the participatory-critical. We characterize each of these perspectives in three dimensions: ontological (how health and education are understood), epistemological (what are the recognized sources of knowledge) and praxis (educational perspective that is sustained). We could say that in the COVID-19 pandemic, among other thigs an unequal, accelerated, complex and planetary social learning process is underway, regarding how to think and what to do with our health. In this context, we identify a very generalized deployment of the verticalist-hygienist perspective in which the great centers of knowledge-power have sought to transfer behavioral norms to the population in order to regulate bodies and actions at the level of self-care, being communication (understood as diffusion) the main educational device used. We describe, in turn, processes of organization and resistance on the margins that have deployed other logics and practices that we associate with democratic-participatory / critical positions. In closing, we ask ourselves how we can contribute from the social sciences and from Latin American thought to face an urgent and necessary transformation of the hegemonic paradigm.","Garelli, Fernando Miguel Dumrauf Ana Gabriela",Espacio Abierto,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4966140,414

Among the imaging variants, Chest x-rays imaging is cheap, simple, and can be used to detect influenza, tuberculosis, and various other illnesses. Researchers discovered that coronavirus spreads through the lungs, causing severe injuries during the COVID19 pandemic. As a result, chest x-rays can be used to detect COVID-19, making it a more robust detection method. In this paper, a RegNet hierarchical deep learning-based model has been proposed to detect COVID-19 positive and negative cases using CXI. The RegNet structure is designed to develop a model with a small number of epochs and parameters. The performance measurement found that the model takes five periods to reach a total accuracy of 98.08%. To test the model, we used two sets of data. The first dataset consists of 1200 COVID-19 positive CXRs and 1,341 COVID-19 negative CXRs, and the second dataset consists of 195 COVID-19 positive CXRs and 2,000 COVID-19 negative CXRs;all of these are publicly available. We obtained precision of 99.02% and 97.13% for these datasets, respectively. As a result of this finding, the proposed approach could be used for mass screening, and, as far as we are aware, the results achieved indicate that this model could be used as a screen guide. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Mahbub, M.

These online classes were delivered either synchronously via a web teleconferencing application or asynchronously through pre-recorded videos that were uploaded to the learning management system (LMS). The online delivery of anatomy practical classes has become a major concern among anatomy lecturers and students, especially in public institutions, as there is a lack of hands-on experience and social interaction.

In this study, we have characterized, in vitro, the human coronavirus HCV 229E papain-like cysteine-proteinase PCP 1. We show that PCP 1 is able to mediate cleavage of an aminoterminal polypeptide, p9, from in vitro translation products representing the aminoproximal region of pp 1a/pp 1ab. Mutagenesis studies support the prediction of Cys1054 and His1278 as the catalytic amino acids of the HCV 229E PCP 1, since mutation of these residues abolishes the proteolytic activity of the enzyme.","Herold, J; Thiel, V; Siddell, S G",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9782276/,414

Virus infection begins in the nasopharynx and causes spotty destruction of the nasal ciliated epithelium. Transmission occurs chiefly via droplets of various sizes transported through the air, but some types of virus persist in moist secretions on handled objects and may retain their infectiousness. Living in crowded, poorly-ventilated quarters facilitates transmission. Not many virus particles survive in saliva and it is difficult to infect via the lips or mouth. Kissing does not efficiently spread cold infection. Prophylactic treatment with interferon does not protect against cold infection. Aspirin and acetaminophen reduced serum antibody response and increased nasal symptoms in a controlled Australian study. The combination of intranasal interferon and ipratropium with oral naproxen gave promising results in experimental rhinovirus inoculation.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), one of the binding sites for SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, can bind to viral spike proteins, allowing transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) to activate S-protein to trigger infection and induce the production of various inflammatory factors such as interleukin-1, interferon-l, and tumor necrosis factor. Compared with adults, children tend to have lower expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which are presumed to be associated with milder symptoms and fewer cases in children.

The most populated Southeast Asia region is particularly vulnerable. The arboviral diseases such as dengue (DEN), Japanese encephalitis (JE), West Nile virus (WNV), chikungunya fever (CHIK), hemorrhagic fevers such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic (CCHF) fever, Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV), etc. are on the rise and have spread unprecedentedly, causing considerable burden of disease. The emergence/re-emergence of these diseases is associated with complex factors, such as viral recombination and mutation, leading to more virulent and adaptive strains, urbanization and human activities creating more permissive environment for vector-host interaction, and increased air travel and commerce. Climate is a major factor in determining the geographic and temporal distribution of arthropods, the characteristics of arthropod life cycles, the consequent dispersal patterns of associated arboviruses, the evolution of arboviruses; and the efficiency with which they are transmitted from arthropods to vertebrate hosts. The present and future arboviral threats must be mitigated by priority actions such as improving surveillance and outbreak response, establishing collaboration and communication intersectorally, and strengthening the prevention and control programmes along with improving biosafety aspects with regards to highly infectious nature of these arboviral diseases.

METHODS: The activity of a vascular surgery unit was analysed from 8 March to 8 April 2020. Surgical activity was maintained only for acute or elective procedures obeying priority criteria. The preventive screening protocol consisted of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) for all patients and physicians with symptoms and for unprotected contact infected cases, and serological physician evaluations every 15 days. Patients treated in the acute setting were considered theoretically infected and the necessary protective devices were used. The number of patients and the possible infection of physicians were evaluated. The number and type of interventions and the need for post-operative IC during this period were compared with those in the same periods in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-one interventions were performed, of which 34 (23%) were acute/emergency. The total number of interventions was similar to those performed in the same periods in 2019 and 2018: 150 (33, of which 22% acute/emergency) and 117 (29, 25% acute/emergency), respectively. IC was necessary after 6% (17% in 2019 and 20% in 2018) of elective operations and 33% (11) of acute/emergency interventions. None of the patients treated electively were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection during hospitalisation. Of the 34 patients treated in acute/emergency interventions, five (15%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. It was necessary to screen 14 (47%) vascular surgeons with NPS after contact with infected colleagues, but none for unprotected contact with patients; all were found to be negative on NPS and serological evaluation. CONCLUSION: A dedicated protocol allowed maintenance of regular elective vascular surgery activity during the emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, with no contamination of patients or physicians and minimal need for IC resources.","Pini, Rodolfo; Faggioli, Gianluca; Vacirca, Andrea; Gallitto, Enrico; Mascoli, Chiara; Attard, Luciano; Viale, Pierluigi; Gargiulo, Mauro",Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg,,414

A survey was conducted in July 2020 with questions on knowledge of COVID-19, attitudes and behaviors towards COVID-19, and primary sources of information. 305 survey respondents met criteria for further analysis, and descriptive statistical analyses were applied. Participants were generally knowledgeable of the pandemic, with a mean knowledge score of 11.40 out of 13 (SD 1.3). The attitude statement with the highest rate of agreement was that ""social distancing is an effective way of controlling COVID-19 spread"" (n = 265, 86.9%) and that with the highest rate of disagreement was, ""I am not worried about my friends' and family members health"" (n = 253, 83.0%). The most-implemented behaviors as indicated by participants were avoiding contact with sick individuals and washing hands with soap and water often (n = 294, 96.4%), and the least implemented was avoiding meat consumption (n = 257, 84.3%). Finally, most participants indicated that health officials were their primary source of information (n = 215, 70.5%). Participants of this survey had fairly good knowledge of the virus. Attitudes of participants as a whole may be described as cautious without being overly fearful. Reported behaviors also align well with current public health recommendations. These responses may be reflective of where participants are receiving their information, which, for the majority, is from public health officials.","Bakdash, Talah; Marsh, Courtney",J. community health,,414

207053,On the effectiveness of the search and find method to suppress spread of SARS-CoV-2,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Many antiviral agents, such as hydroxychloroquine, have been used to treat COVID-19, without being broadly accepted. QTc prolongation is a worrisome adverse effect, scarcely studied in pediatrics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Paediatric patients affected from COVID-19 who received antivirals were matched (1:2) with controls not infected nor exposed. Electrocardiograms were prospectively analyzed at baseline, during the first 72 hours in treatment and after 72 hours. RESULTS: Eleven (22.9%) out of 48 patients admitted due to COVID-19 (March-July 2020) received antiviral therapy. All had underlying diseases: congenital heart disease (4/11; 36.4%) and immunosuppression (3/11; 27.3%) stand out. 5/11 (45.5%) received treatment at baseline with a potential effect on QTc. There where no differences observed in the baseline QTc between cases and controls: 414.8ms (49.2) vs 416.5ms (29.4), (p=0.716). Baseline long QT was observed in 2/11 cases and 2/22. Among cases, 10/11 (90.9%) received hydroxychloroquine, mainly associated with azithromycin (8/11; 72.7%), 3 received lopinavir/ritonavir and one remdesivir. The median increase in QTc after 72 hours under treatment was 28.9 ms [IQR 48.7] (p=0.062). 4/11 (36.4%) patients had a long QTc at 72 hours, resulting in 3 patients &#8805;500ms; treatment was stopped in one (QTc 510ms) but ventricular arrhythmias were not documented. CONCLUSIONS: The use of antivirals caused an increase on the QTc interval after 72 hours of treatment, being the QTc long in 36.3% of the patients, although no arrhythmic events were observed. The use of hydroxychloroquine and antivirals requires active QTc monitoring and it is recommended to discontinue treatment if QTc >500ms.","Esmel-Vilomara, Roger; Dolader, Paola; Sabaté-Rotes, Anna; Soriano-Arandes, Antoni; Gran, Ferran; Rosés-Noguer, Ferran",,,414
207054,On the effectiveness of the search and find method to suppress spread of SARS-CoV-2,2021,"Verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC; also known as Shiga toxin-producing E. coli ) are a significant cause of foodborne illnesses around the world. Due to the serological and genomic diversity of VTEC, methods of detection for VTEC in food samples require detection of verotoxin or its gene vt (also known as stx ). The current taxonomy of vt identifies three vt1 (a,c,d) and seven vt2 (a to g) subtypes. PCR detection of vt is convenient and rapid, but protocols may not detect all currently identified variants or subtypes of vt . The Health Canada Compendium of Analytical Methods for the analysis of food for VTEC is MFLP-52. MFLP-52 includes a VT Screening PCR that is used to determine the presumptive presence of VTEC by the detection of vt in food enrichments, and to differentiate VTEC from other isolates. The VT Screening PCR was developed prior to the establishment of the current vt taxonomy. An evaluation of VT Screening PCR for detection of the ten established vt -subtypes was performed and it was discovered that the method could not detect subtypes vt1d and vt2f . Additional primers and a modified protocol were developed and the modified VT Screening PCR was tested against an inclusivity panel of 50 VTEC strains, including representatives of ten vt -subtypes, and an exclusivity panel of 30 vt negative E. coli from various sources, to ensure specificity. The reliability of MFLP-52 with the modified VT Screening PCR was assessed by analysis of four priority food matrices (ground beef, lettuce, cheese and apple cider) inoculated with a VTEC strain at 2 to 5 CFU per 25 g. The modified VT Screening PCR was determined to be able to detect all ten vt -subtypes and reliably detect the presence of VTEC in all tested food enrichments.","McMahon, Tanis; Bastian, Jillian; Alshawa, Inas; Gill, Alexander",J. foof prot,,414

209812,SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity in Venezuela: Predominance of D614G variants and analysis of one outbreak,2021,"Aim: To compare different pooling methods in an attempt to improve the COVID-19 PCR diagnostic capacities. Method: We developed a novel information-dependent pooling protocol (indept), based on transmission of less informative sequential pools on to the next pooling cycle to maximize savings. We then compared it to the halving, generalized halving, splitting and hypercube protocols in a simulation study, across variety of scenarios. Results: All five methods yielded various amount of test savings, which mostly depended on the virus prevalence in the population. In situations of low prevalence (up to 5%), indept had the best performance, requiring on average 20% of tests needed for singular testing across scenarios that were analyzed. Nevertheless, this comes at the expense of speed, with the worst-case scenario of indept protocol requiring up to twice the time needed to test the same number of samples in comparison to the hypercube protocol. In order to offset this, we developed a faster version of the protocol (indeptSp), which minimizes the number of terminal pools and manages to retain savings compared to other protocols, despite marginally longer processing times. Conclusion: The increasing demand for more testing globally can benefit from application of pooling, especially in resource-restrained situations of the low- and middle-income countries or situations of high testing demand. Singular testing in situations of low prevalence should be systematically discouraged.","Vukicevic, Damir; Polasek, Ozren",J Glob Health,,414

212296,SARS-CoV-2 Spike-Heat Shock Protein A5 (GRP78) Recognition may be Related to the Immersed Human Coronaviruses,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We reviewed the literature to evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who had neurological symptoms and had an MRI that showed (1) central nervous system (CNS) hyperintense lesions not attributed to ischemia and/or (2) leptomeningeal enhancement. We sought to determine if these findings were associated with a positive CSF severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). METHODS: We performed a systematic review of Medline and Embase from December 1, 2019 to November 18, 2020. CSF results were evaluated based on the presence/absence of (1) &#8805; 1 CNS hyperintense lesion and (2) leptomeningeal enhancement. RESULTS: In 117 publications, we identified 193 patients with COVID-19 who had an MRI of the CNS and CSF testing. There were 125 (65%) patients with CNS hyperintense lesions. Patients with CNS hyperintense lesions were significantly more likely to have a positive CSF SARS-CoV-2 PCR (10% [9/87] vs. 0% [0/43], p = 0.029). Of 75 patients who had a contrast MRI, there were 20 (27%) patients who had leptomeningeal enhancement. Patients with leptomeningeal enhancement were significantly more likely to have a positive CSF SARS-CoV-2 PCR (25% [4/16] vs. 5% [2/42], p = 0.024). CONCLUSION: The presence of CNS hyperintense lesions or leptomeningeal enhancement on neuroimaging from patients with COVID-19 is associated with increased likelihood of a positive CSF SARS-CoV-2 PCR. However, a positive CSF SARS-CoV-2 PCR is uncommon in patients with these neuroimaging findings, suggesting they are often related to other etiologies, such as inflammation, hypoxia, or ischemia.","Lewis, Ariane; Jain, Rajan; Frontera, Jennifer; Placantonakis, Dimitris G; Galetta, Steven; Balcer, Laura; Melmed, Kara R",j. neuroimaging,,414

Whilst there is emerging evidence that negative mental health impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may be more pronounced for women than men, less attention has focussed on changes to health behaviours and health seeking experienced by women. Similarly, the impact of the pandemic in rural areas has not been investigated in detail. Our research questions were 'have females residing in rural areas experienced changes in alcohol consumption, unhealthy food consumption, smoking, exercise or health seeking during the COVID-19 pandemic?' and 'are there differences in health behaviour changes between rural females living with or without children?'. Net increases (scale of 0-1) in consumption of unhealthy food (95% CI 0.05, 0.22) and alcohol (95% CI 0.12, 0.29) were observed. Net decreases (scale of -1 to 0) in visits to the doctor (95% CI -0.23, -0.35) and other health professionals (95% CI -0.40, -0.54) were observed. Compared with females living without children, females who lived with children were significantly associated with increased alcohol consumption (OR 2.4 (95% CI 1.4, 4.1), decreased visits to the doctor (OR 1.9 (95% CI 1.1, 3.2) and decreased visits to other health professionals (OR 1.9 (95% CI 1.1, 3.3). Results suggest that public health approaches may be required to support females residing in rural areas to optimise their health behaviours during the pandemic, particularly for those living with children. Policies must be gender responsive to counteract worsening health and social inequities both during and after the pandemic.","Glenister, Kristen M; Ervin, Kaye; Podubinski, Tegan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,414
215857,Subunit Vaccine Against Sars-Cov-2 Using CTL and HTL Epitopes (preprint),2021,"BACKGROUND: Immunosuppressive therapy has been a great concern during the pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate the pandemic's impact on psoriasis patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The multicenter study was conducted in 14 tertiary dermatology centers. Demographic data, treatment status, disease course, and cases of COVID-19 were evaluated in patients with psoriasis using the immunosuppressive treatment. RESULTS: Of 1827 patients included, the drug adherence rate was 68.2%. Those receiving anti-interleukin (anti-IL) drugs were more likely to continue treatment than patients receiving conventional drugs (OR = 1.50, 95% CI, 1.181-1.895, p = .001). Disease worsening rate was 24.2% and drug dose reduction increased this rate 3.26 and drug withdrawal 8.71 times. Receiving anti-TNF or anti-IL drugs was associated with less disease worsening compared to conventional drugs (p = .038, p = .032; respectively). Drug withdrawal causes were 'unable to come' (39.6%), 'COVID concern' (25.3%), and 'physician's and patient's co-decision' (17.4%). Four patients had COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms. The incidence was 0.0022% while it was 0.0025% in the general population. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that psoriasis patients using systemic immunosuppressive do not have a higher, but even lower COVID-19 risk than the general population, and treatment compliance with biological drugs is higher.","Kartal, Selda Pelin; Çelik, Gökçen; Yilmaz, Oguz; Öksüm Solak, Eda; Demirbag Gül, Büsra; Üstünbas, Tuba Kevser; Gönülal, Melis; Baysak, Sevim; Yüksel, Esma Inan; Ünlü, Begüm; Güven, Münevver; Bozdag, Ali; Çinar, Gökhan; Kartal, Selim; Borlu, Murat; Özden, Müge Güler; Engin, Burhan; Serdaroglu, Server; Balci, Didem Didar; Dogan, Bilal; Çiçek, Demet; Yazici, Ayça Cordan; Aytekin, Sema; Sendur, Neslihan; Saricaoglu, Hayriye; Kaçar, Nida Gelincik; Dogramaci, Asena Cigdem; Dönmez, Levent; Alpsoy, Erkan",J Dermatolog Treat,,414
216470,Bi-paratopic and multivalent VH domains block ACE2 binding and neutralize SARS-CoV-2,2021,"In this manuscript we propose a method for pricing insurance products that cover not only traditional risks, but also unforeseen ones. By considering the Poisson process parameter to be a mixed random variable, we capture the heterogeneity of foreseeable and unforeseeable risks. To illustrate, we estimate the weights for the two risk streams for a real dataset from a Portuguese insurer. To calculate the premium, we set the frequency and severity as distributions that belong to the linear exponential family. Under a Bayesian setup , we show that when working with a finite mixture of conjugate priors, the premium can be estimated by a mixture of posterior means, with updated parameters, depending on claim histories. We emphasise the riskiness of the unforeseeable trend, by choosing heavy-tailed distributions. After estimating distribution parameters involved using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, we found that Bayesian premiums derived are more reactive to claim trends than traditional ones.","Ni, Weihong; Constantinescu, Corina; Reis, Alfredo Eg'idio dos; Maume-Deschamps, V'eronique",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03123v1.pdf,414

The proposed enhanced model, which will be referred to as the SEIR (Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered) model with population migration, is inspired by the role that asymptomatic infected individuals, as well as population movements can play a crucial role in spreading the virus. In the model, the infected and the basic reproduction numbers are compared under the influence of intervention policies. The experimental simulation results show the impact of social distancing and migration-in rates on reducing the total number of infections and the basic reproductions. And then, the importance of controlling the number of migration-in people and the policy of restricting residents’ movements in preventing the spread of COVID-19 pandemic are verified.","Chen, Min; Li, Miao; Hao, Yixue; Liu, Zhongchun; Hu, Long; Wang, Lin",Inf.

The aim of this study was to identify which blood tests could be used to assist in diagnosing COVID-19. MethodA retrospective review was performed of consecutive patients referred to hospital with a clinical suspicion of COVID-19 over a period of 4 weeks. The patientâs clinical presentation, and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction) were recorded. The patients were divided by diagnosis into COVID (COVID-19 infection) or CONTROL (an alternate diagnosis). A retrospective review of consecutive patients over a further 2-week period were used for the purposes of validation. ResultsOverall, 399 patients (53% COVID, 47% CONTROL) were analysed. White cell count (WCC), neutrophils (NEU) and lymphocytes (LYM) were significantly lower, while lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin (FER) were significantly higher, in the COVID group in comparison to CONTROL. Combining the WCC, LYM and FER results into a COVID Combined Blood Test (CCBT) had an AUC of 0.79. Using a threshold CCBT of -0.8 resulted in a sensitivity of 0.85 and a specificity of 0.63. Analysing this against a further retrospective review of 181 suspected COVID-19 patients, using the same CCBT threshold, resulted in a sensitivity of 0.73 and a specificity of 0.75. The sensitivity was comparable to the SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR. DiscussionMathematically combining the blood tests has the potential to assist clinical acumen allowing for rapid streaming and more accurate patient flow pending definitive diagnosis. This may be of particular use in low resource settings.","Parsons, Iain Thomas; Parsons, Alan T; Balme, Eleanor; Hazell, Georgina; Gifford, Robert; Stacey, Michael J; Woods, David R; Russell-Jones, David",Ann Clin Biochem,,414

It draws on the conservation of resources (COR) theory, which posits that proactive coping and future time orientation are crucial personal resources that affect the capacity of an individual to adapt to stressful situations. The results show that in the relationship between proactive coping and perceived work productivity, future time orientation acts as a full mediator in Taiwan and a partial mediator in the U.S. The study extends the application of the COR theory to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and offers important insights that will enable professionals to assess the role of proactive coping and future time orientation in their productivity evaluations of working tasks and to design appropriate training sessions.","Chang, Yuhsuan; Chien, Chuang-Rei; Shen, Li-Fang",Pers Individ Dif,,414

219676,Antiviral Activity of Vacuolar ATPase Blocker Diphyllin against SARS-CoV-2,2021,"The COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a health crisis worldwide. While developing novel drugs and vaccines is long, repurposing existing drugs against COVID-19 can yield treatments with known preclinical, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicity profiles, which can rapidly enter clinical trials. In this study, we present a novel network-based drug repurposing platform to identify candidates for the treatment of COVID-19. At the time of the initial outbreak, knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 was lacking, but based on its similarity with other viruses, we sought to identify repurposing candidates to be tested rapidly at the clinical or preclinical levels. We first analyzed the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and confirmed SARS as the closest virus by genome similarity, followed by MERS and other human coronaviruses. Using text mining and database searches, we obtained 34 COVID-19-related genes to seed the construction of a molecular network where our module detection and drug prioritization algorithms identified 24 disease-related human pathways, five modules, and 78 drugs to repurpose. Based on clinical knowledge, we re-prioritized 30 potentially repurposable drugs against COVID-19 (including pseudoephedrine, andrographolide, chloroquine, abacavir, and thalidomide). Our work shows how in silico repurposing analyses can yield testable candidates to accelerate the response to novel disease outbreaks.","Li, Xu; Yu, Jinchao; Zhang, Zhiming; Ren, Jing; Peluffo, Alex E; Zhang, Wen; Zhao, Yujie; Wu, Jiawei; Yan, Kaijing; Cohen, Daniel; Wang, Wenjia",Med Drug Discov,,414
220739,Convergent evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in human and animals,2021,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has led to a global pandemic. The United States has been severely affected, accounting for the most COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide. Without a coordinated national public health plan informed by surveillance with actionable metrics, the United States has been ineffective at preventing and mitigating the escalating COVID-19 pandemic. Existing surveillance has incomplete ascertainment and is limited by the use of standard surveillance metrics. Although many COVID-19 data sources track infection rates, informing prevention requires capturing the relevant dynamics of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop dynamic metrics for public health surveillance that can inform worldwide COVID-19 prevention efforts. Advanced surveillance techniques are essential to inform public health decision making and to identify where and when corrective action is required to prevent outbreaks. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted COVID-19 data from global public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to measure daily case numbers for our use case in 50 US states and the District of Colombia as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: Examination of the United States and state data demonstrated that most US states are experiencing outbreaks as measured by these new metrics of speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence. Larger US states have high COVID-19 caseloads as a function of population size, density, and deficits in adherence to public health guidelines early in the epidemic, and other states have alarming rates of speed, acceleration, jerk, and 7-day persistence in novel infections. North and South Dakota have had the highest rates of COVID-19 transmission combined with positive acceleration, jerk, and 7-day persistence. Wisconsin and Illinois also have alarming indicators and already lead the nation in daily new COVID-19 infections. As the United States enters its third wave of COVID-19, all 50 states and the District of Colombia have positive rates of speed between 7.58 (Hawaii) and 175.01 (North Dakota), and persistence, ranging from 4.44 (Vermont) to 195.35 (North Dakota) new infections per 100,000 people. CONCLUSIONS: Standard surveillance techniques such as daily and cumulative infections and deaths are helpful but only provide a static view of what has already occurred in the pandemic and are less helpful in prevention. Public health policy that is informed by dynamic surveillance can shift the country from reacting to COVID-19 transmissions to being proactive and taking corrective action when indicators of speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence remain positive week over week. Implicit within our dynamic surveillance is an early warning system that indicates when there is problematic growth in COVID-19 transmissions as well as signals when growth will become explosive without action. A public health approach that focuses on prevention can prevent major outbreaks in addition to endorsing effective public health policies. Moreover, subnational analyses on the dynamics of the pandemic allow us to zero in on where transmissions are increasing, meaning corrective action can be applied with precision in problematic areas. Dynamic public health surveillance can inform specific geographies where quarantines are necessary while preserving the economy in other US areas.","Post, Lori Ann; Issa, Tariq Ziad; Boctor, Michael J; Moss, Charles B; Murphy, Robert L; Ison, Michael G; Achenbach, Chad J; Resnick, Danielle; Singh, Lauren Nadya; White, Janine; Faber, Joshua Marco Mitchell; Culler, Kasen; Brandt, Cynthia A; Oehmke, James Francis",J Med Internet Res,,414

This paper applies an exploratory time-series analysis to the evolution of the disease in Greece, which currently suggests a success story of COVID-19 management. The proposed method builds on a recent conceptualization of detecting connective communities in a time-series and develops a novel spline regression model where the knot vector is determined by the community detection in the complex network. Overall, the study contributes to the COVID-19 research by proposing a free of disconnected past-data and reliable framework of forecasting, which can facilitate decision-making and management of the available health resources.","Demertzis, Konstantinos; Tsiotas, Dimitrios; Magafas, Lykourgos",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,414

The aim of the BIOSOLVE-II and -III studies was to assess the safety and performance of a magnesium based sirolimus-eluting scaffold; we report the clinical outcomes at 3 years, 2 years after scaffold resorption. METHODS/MATERIALS: BIOSOLVE-II and BIOSOLVE-III are international, prospective multi-center studies, including 184 patients with 189 de novo lesions and stable or unstable angina, or documented silent ischemia. Acute myocardial infarction, 3-vessel coronary artery disease and heavily calcified lesions were excluded. Antiplatelet therapy was recommended for 6-months. RESULTS: Patients were 65.5 ± 10.8 years old, and lesions were 12.1 ± 4.5 mm long and located in vessels with a diameter of 2.7 ± 0.4 mm. More than half of the lesions (56.5%) were type B2/C lesions. At 2 years, 92.5% (160/173) of patients were symptom-free and 91.5% (151/165) at 3 years; all the other patients had stable angina.

227211,Inhibiting Ebola virus and SARS-CoV-2 entry,2020,"Prenatal micronutrients in pregnant women’s diets, including supplements, have an essential role in fetal brain development and may reduce the risk of mental disorders in offspring. Folic acid, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, and choline have been investigated for this purpose. Folic acid supplementation throughout pregnancy has well-established positive effects. Vitamin D, administered to the mother before birth or to the newborn, has also been shown to reduce the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy have a more uncertain role, with recent trials questioning a beneficial effect on cognition and attention deficit disorder, despite positive effects on prematurity and neonatal wheezing prevention. Choline supplementation is associated with positive effects on cognition and behavior, including early behaviors associated with the development of autism and schizophrenia. There is no experience yet with COVID-19, but adverse effects on fetal brain development of most common coronaviruses are mitigated by higher choline levels. Maternal dietary supplementation of nutrients is a benign and inexpensive intervention in pregnancy to prevent life-long disability from mental illness. Use of dietary supplements in poorer, rural areas of China is below recommendations. Physicians, midwives, and public health officials in China can promote prenatal nutrient supplementation to reduce the future burden of mental illnesses that might be prevented before birth.","Li, Ying; Freedman, Robert",Pediatr.

229444,Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays as a rapid diagnostic for COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tocilizumab (TCZ; interleukine-6 receptor antagonist) has been proposed to treat severe forms of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) because interleukine-6 plays an important role in COVID-19-induced cytokine storm. Several clinical studies have shown very good effects of TCZ in patients with COVID-19, with a few minor side effects reported. Only eight serious liver injuries caused by TCZ were reported before being used in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Considering the significantly increased use of TCZ for the treatment of COVID-19, we would like to warn of its rare but possible serious hepatotoxicity, especially when used together with other hepatotoxic drugs. METHODS: We describe a patient with COVID-19-induced cytokine storm who developed drug-induced liver injury associated with the use of TCZ. RESULTS: One day after TCZ administration, serum transaminase levels increased 40-fold. Nevertheless, TCZ had a positive effect on clinical and laboratory parameters in cytokine storm, with transaminases values normalizing in 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of DILI caused by TCZ in a COVID-19 patient. Intensive liver function monitoring is imperative in COVID-19 patients, because of frequent polypharmacy with potentially hepatotoxic drugs.","Muhovic, Damir; Bojovic, Jelena; Bulatovic, Ana; Vukcevic, Batric; Ratkovic, Marina; Lazovic, Ranko; Smolovic, Brigita",Liver int,,414

Recently, patients with hyperinflammatory shock have been identified among children who are confirmed to have or are suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection. The presenting signs and symptoms are characterized by prolonged fever, abdominal pain, and cardiac involvement without any signs of pneumonia on chest computed tomography. However, it is uncertain at this time whether SARS-CoV-2 infection affects this syndrome. Compared to adults, quite a few children are asymptomatic even when infected with SARS-CoV-2, which could make these children serious sources of infection at home or in medical institutions. Considering these characteristics, it is important to take appropriate precautions during medical examinations and perform infection control in emergency departments to save the lives of both the children and adult patients. Most healthy children are suffering huge stress due to restrictions against going outside and school closures as social means to control infection. It is possible that children are socially isolated when they come to the emergency department, and they might require mental or social support even if they are only complaining about their physical condition. Healthcare providers are required to examine the children's circumstances carefully and cooperate with workers in other professions appropriately.","Imai, Kazunori; Matsushima, Asako; Saitoh, Shinji",Acute medicine &amp; surgery,,414
233666,Sieve analysis to understand how SARS-CoV-2 diversity can impact vaccine protection,2021,"Streptobacillus felis is a fastidious microorganism and a novel member of the potentially zoonotic bacteria causing rat bite fever. Since its description, this is the second isolation of S. felis in a diseased member of the Felidae. Interestingly, the strain from this study was isolated from a zoo held, rusty-spotted cat (Prionailurus rubiginosus), with pneumonia, thereby indicating a possible broader host range in feline species. A recent preliminary sampling of domestic cats (Felis silvestris forma catus) revealed that this microorganism is common in the oropharynx, suggesting that S. felis is a member of their normal microbiota. Due to unawareness, fastidiousness, antibiotic sensitivity and lack of diagnostics the role of S. felis as a cat and human pathogen might be under-reported as with other Streptobacillus infections. More studies are necessary to elucidate the role of S. felis in domestic cats and other Felidae in order to better estimate its zoonotic potential.","Fawzy, Ahmad; Rau, Jörg; Riße, Karin; Schauerte, Nicole; Geiger, Christina; Blom, Jochen; Imirzalioglu, Can; Falgenhauer, Jane; Bach, Alexa; Herden, Christiane; Eisenberg, Tobias",Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek,,414

237548,Cheminformatics-Based Identification of Potential Novel Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Natural Compounds of African Origin,2021,"The SARS-COVID-2019 pandemic of 2020 severely weakened the surgical innovation pipeline and ecosystem, primarily due to factors that include lack of a coordinated federal response, weakened health insurance coverage, a politicized approach to public health and safety, and disruption of the US economy. A successful bench to bedside innovation requires trust in the scientific research, open research and clinical facilities, and participation of patients in clinical studies. In addition, stay-at-home orders and the shutdown of elective medical and surgical care and research laboratories diminished opportunities for the informal interactions that are part of the new product development process. The pandemic and how it was managed prolonged the length of time for creation, adoption, and diffusion of new products and services into the market. Furthermore, the loss of hospital revenues from canceled elective care translates into a much smaller market for new technologies. Looking forward, critical success factors for innovation include federal policy that supports science and offers access and insurance coverage for health care, including addressing social determinants of health. Any further shutdowns of research and clinical care will hinder necessary collaborations between scientists, clinicians, and patients. Economic recovery is required to ensure federal and corporate funding for research and development. Trust in science must be restored to ensure support of necessary regulatory review processes and sufficient participation in clinical trials. Surgical discoveries have brought about lifesaving and life-extending cures, and the pipeline of these discoveries must continue without interruption.","Gordon, Toby",Surg Innov,,414

In this essay, I describe 2 of my most formative experiences with telehealth: participating in my medical school's new ""tele-hotspotting"" elective, and providing virtual gender-affirming care through our student-run free clinic. These experiences demonstrate not only telehealth's utility during a viral pandemic, but also its potential as a powerful tool for expanding access to care and promoting health equity over the coming years. With this said, telehealth is not without limitations. Patients and clinicians alike have expressed concerns regarding the challenge of performing a physical exam and maintaining emotional connection across physical distance. A sustained expansion of telehealth is further challenged by inconsistent availability of broadband Internet, as well as a lack of standardized reimbursement procedures for telehealth visits. Strategies are available to help meet these challenges while maximizing health equity.","Kaplan, Ben",Ann Fam Med,,414

239106,Where are the RNA vaccines for TB?,2021,"Social determinants of health are responsible for a large proportion of disease which disproportionately affects deprived population groups, resulting in striking disparities in life expectancy and quality of life. Even systems with universal access to healthcare (such as the UK's NHS) can only mitigate some consequences of health inequalities. Instead substantial societal measures are required both to reduce harmful exposures and to improve standards of housing, education, work, nutrition and exercise. The case for such measures is widely accepted among healthcare professionals but, in wider discourse, scepticism has remained about the role of government and society in improving life chances along with the belief that responsibility for health and wellbeing should rest with individuals themselves. The stark inequalities exposed by the coronavirus pandemic could be an opportunity to challenge this thinking. This paper argues that doctors should do more to persuade others of the need to address health inequalities and that to achieve this, it is important to understand the ethical and philosophical perspectives that are sceptical of such measures. An approach to gaining greater support for interventions to address health inequalities is presented along with reflections on effective political advocacy which is consistent with physicians' professional values.","Bradley, Stephen H",Clin Med (Lond),,414

The study group was formed by criterion sampling, which is one of the purposeful sampling methods. The criteria determined were for the participants to work, to have pedagogical formation training online, and to have previously had face-to-face training. Accordingly, 35 foreign language teacher candidates participated in the study. A semi-structured interview form consisting of five questions was used to collect the data. Content analysis technique was used in the analysis of the data and themes were reached from the codes. From the data obtained, it was concluded that the plans made about education in the COVID-19 process could not be followed due to the inability to perceive time, the process negatively affected time management as it created psychological pressure and wasted time, this changed the perception of time by making the time to pass quickly, that there were motivation problems arising from the focus and lack of explanations about the lessons and family factors and that time traps related to excessive computer use, watching movies-series, and excessive communication were encountered. At the same time, it was determined that the COVID-19 process has positive effects on preventing wasting time due to the traffic problem, creating a chance for individuals to spend more time for themselves and providing a more flexible studying environment. Regarding the negative effects of the COVID-19 process on time management, it is recommended that teacher candidates, who assume a great responsibility especially in the field of education, receive training on stress coping, distance education and time management in order to avoid or be affected less by the negative effects such as pandemics without field limitation.","Cengizhan, Sibel",Educational Policy Analysis and Strategic Research,,414

Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of air-oxidized and dithionite-reduced ACIII from the photosynthetic bacterium Roseiflexus castenholzii at 3.3- and 3.5-Å resolution, respectively. We identified a menaquinol binding pocket and an electron transfer wire comprising six hemes and four iron-sulfur clusters that is capable of transferring electrons to periplasmic acceptors. We detected a proton translocation passage in which three strictly conserved, mid-passage residues are likely essential for coupling the redox-driven proton translocation across the membrane. These results allow us to propose a previously unrecognized coupling mechanism that links the respiratory and photosynthetic functions of ACIII.

DESIGN: A three-round Delphi survey involving hearing healthcare professionals built towards clinical consensus on a definition of hyperacusis. Round 1 involved three open-ended questions about hyperacusis. Seventy-nine statements were generated on descriptions, impact, sounds, and potential features of hyperacusis. Agreement on the relevance of each statement to defining or describing hyperacusis was then measured in Rounds 2 and 3. General consensus was defined a priori as &#8805;70% agreement, or &#8805;90 for clinical decision making. STUDY SAMPLE: Forty-five hearing healthcare professionals were recruited to take part in this study. Forty-one completed Round 1, 36 completed Round 2, and 33 completed Round 3. RESULTS: Consensus was reached on 42/79 statements. From these a consensus definition includes ""A reduced tolerance to sound(s) that are perceived as normal to the majority of the population or were perceived as normal to the person before their onset of hyperacusis"". A consensus description of hyperacusis was also determined.

Healthcare services such as renal transplantation had to rapidly adjust and meet the needs to (1) protect patients and staff, (2) ramp up, conserve or redeploy resources while (3) ensuring that critical services remained operational. This paper aims to describe the experience of the renal transplant programme at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) in responding to the risks and constraints posed by the pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is a review and summary of the SGH renal transplant programme's policy and protocols that were either modified or developed in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. RESULTS: A multi-pronged approach was adopted to respond to the challenges of COVID-19. These included ensuring business continuity by splitting the transplant team into different locations, adopting video and tele-consults to minimise potential patient exposure to COVID-19, streamlining work processes using electronic forms, ensuring safe paths for patients who needed to come to hospital, ring-fencing and testing new inpatients at risk for COVID-19, enhancing precautionary measures for transplant surgery, ensuring a stable supply chain of immunosuppression, and sustaining patient and staff education programmes via video conferencing. CONCLUSIONS: Though the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced access to kidney transplantation, opportunities arose to adopt telemedicine into mainstream transplant practice as well as use electronic platforms to streamline work processes. Screening protocols were established to ensure that transplantation could be performed safely, while webinars reached out to empower patients to take precautions against COVID-19.","Kee, Terence; Hl, Valerie Gan; Shimin, Jasmine Chung; Sing, Tee Ping; Moi, Lu York; Peng, Chan Lai; Ht, Elizabeth Cheong; Hoon, Lee Puay; Hua, Yong Jin; Yao, Ho Quan; Thangaraju, Sobhana; Foo, Fiona; Kwan, Natelie; Ng, Eleanor; Xia, He; Lee, Constance; Boey, Shannon; Foo, Marjorie; Suai, Tan Chieh",Ann Acad Med Singap,,414
249084,Identification of HLA-A*02:01-restricted candidate epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2 that may be natural targets of CD8+ T cell recognition in vivo,2020,"Within the agile paradigm, many software product companies create cross-functional product development teams that own their product or a defined set of product features. In contrast to development teams operating within a heavily-disciplined software development process, these product teams often require a deeper and, importantly, a collective understanding of the product domain to serve as a rich context within which to understand the product requirements. Little is known about the factors that support or impede these teams in collectively achieving this deep understanding of the product domain. Using Constructivist Grounded Theory method, we study individuals and teams across seven software companies that create products for a diverse range of markets. The study found that certain organisational and planning process factors play a significant role in whether product development teams have the potential to collectively develop deep domain understanding. These factors also impact individual and development team dynamics. We identify two essential metaphorical dynamics of broadening the lens and blurring boundaries that cross-functional product teams employ in order to fully embrace product ownership, visioning, and planning towards achieving a deep collective domain understanding, creating a richer context in which to understand product requirements. We also conclude that the highly specialised nature of many organisational models and development processes is contraindicated for cross-functional product development teams in achieving this deep collective understanding and we call for a rethinking of conventional organisational and product planning practices for software product development.","Fuller, Robert C.; Kruchten, Philippe",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04238v1.pdf,414

METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, clinical trial registries of ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for relevant articles published up to 18 November 2020. RESULTS: Five RCTs, including 13â544 patients, were included in this meta-analysis. Among them, 3839 and 391 patients were assigned to the 10 day and 5 day remdesivir regimens, respectively. Patients receiving 5 day remdesivir therapy presented greater clinical improvement than those in the control group [ORâ=â1.68 (95% CI 1.18-2.40)], with no significant difference observed between the 10 day and placebo groups [ORâ=â1.23 (95% CI 0.90-1.68)]. Patients receiving remdesivir revealed a greater likelihood of discharge [10 day remdesivir versus control: ORâ=â1.32 (95% CI 1.09-1.60); 5 day remdesivir versus control: ORâ=â1.73 (95% CI 1.28-2.35)] and recovery [10 day remdesivir versus control: OR = 1.29 (95% CI 1.03-1.60); 5 day remdesivir versus control: ORâ=â1.80 (95% CI 1.31-2.48)] than those in the control group. In contrast, no mortality benefit was observed following remdesivir therapy. Furthermore, no significant association was observed between remdesivir treatment and an increased risk of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Remdesivir can help improve the clinical outcome of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and a 5 day regimen, instead of a 10 day regimen, may be sufficient for treatment. Moreover, remdesivir appears as tolerable as other comparators or placebo.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Chen, Chao-Hsien; Wang, Cheng-Yi; Chen, Kuang-Hung; Wang, Ya-Hui; Hsueh, Po-Ren",J. antimicrob. chemother,,414

Infection with NTHi can cause otitis media, sinusitis, conjunctivitis, exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia, but is increasingly causing invasive disease including bacteremia and meningitis. Invasive NTHi strains are more resistant to complement-mediated killing. However, the mechanisms of complement resistance have never been studied in large numbers of invasive NTHi strains.In this study, we determined the relationship between binding of IgG or IgM and the bacterial survival in normal human serum for 267 invasive H. influenzae strains from Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, of which the majority (200, 75%), were NTHi.NTHi bacteria opsonized with high levels of IgM had the lowest survival in human serum. IgM binding to the bacterial surface, but not IgG binding, was shown to be associated with complement-mediated killing of NTHi strains. We conclude that evasion of IgM binding by NTHi strains increases survival in blood, thereby potentially contributing to their ability to cause severe invasive diseases.","Dudukina, Elena; de Smit, Laura; Verhagen, Giel J A; van de Ende, Arie; Marimón, José María; Bajanca-Lavado, Paula; Ardanuy, Carmen; Marti, Sara; de Jonge, Marien I; Langereis, Jeroen D",Infect. immun,,414

In a landscape context, contact opportunities within and between populations are changing rapidly as lockdown measures are relaxed and a number of social activities re-activated. Using an individual-based metapopulation model, we explored the efficacy of different control strategies across an urban-rural gradient in Wales, UK. Our model shows that isolation of symptomatic cases or regional lockdowns in response to local outbreaks have limited efficacy unless the overall transmission rate is kept persistently low. Additional isolation of non-symptomatic infected individuals, who may be detected by effective test-and-trace strategies, is pivotal to reducing the overall epidemic size over a wider range of transmission scenarios. We define an 'urban-rural gradient in epidemic size' as a correlation between regional epidemic size and connectivity within the region, with more highly connected urban populations experiencing relatively larger outbreaks. For interventions focused on regional lockdowns, the strength of such gradients in epidemic size increased with higher travel frequencies, indicating a reduced efficacy of the control measure in the urban regions under these conditions. When both non-symptomatic and symptomatic individuals are isolated or regional lockdown strategies are enforced, we further found the strongest urban-rural epidemic gradients at high transmission rates. This effect was reversed for strategies targeted at symptomatic individuals only. Our results emphasize the importance of test-and-trace strategies and maintaining low transmission rates for efficiently controlling SARS-CoV-2 spread, both at landscape scale and in urban areas.","Wells, Konstans; Lurgi, Miguel; Collins, Brendan; Lucini, Biagio; Kao, Rowland R; Lloyd, Alun L; Frost, Simon D W; Gravenor, Mike B",J R Soc Interface,,414

253318,Structural and Functional Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 RBD Domains Produced in Mammalian Cells,2021,"Background The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has given rise to fear and panic in the public. Although hospitals in China reduced outpatient visits and restricted inpatient admission to lower the risk of transmission of COVID-19, this has significantly affected patients in need of medical attention, for example, patients with emotional disorders. Aims This study aimed to compare the beliefs towards COVID-19 among outpatients with emotional disorders (ie, anxiety or depression) with those of family caregivers and the general public and examine factors that shape the beliefs towards COVID-19 among outpatients with emotional disorders. Methods Survey data from 570 outpatients with anxiety or depression disorders, 449 family caregivers and 470 general public subjects were collected. Multiple stepwise regression analyses were used to describe participants' level of concern, prevention attitude and positive expectations towards the COVID-19 outbreak. Results About 70.9% of outpatients had to postpone their mental health treatment; 43.2% of patients admitted that their mental health was adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak-these patients tended to be older, male and less educated. After controlling for age and education level, outpatients with emotional disorders had significantly lower levels of concerns but more negative expectations towards COVID-19, compared with family caregivers and the public. Multivariate linear stepwise regression analysis showed that age, education and the perception of the impact of COVID-19 on one's existing mental illness were significantly associated with outpatients' beliefs about the epidemic. Conclusion Outpatients with anxiety or depression disorders were relatively less focused on the COVID-19 outbreak, but the impact of the infection was found to be independently associated with their beliefs towards COVID-19. In addition, outpatients who were older and of low educational levels particularly held more negative beliefs about the epidemic, which may place them at a higher risk for poor mental health.","Gao, Yining; Sun, Fei; Jiang, Wenwen; Fang, Yuan; Yue, Ling; Lin, Xiang; Li, Xia",General Psychiatry,,414

METHODS: We conducted targeted surveillance for MIS-C from March 15 to May 20, 2020, in pediatric health centers across the United States. The case definition included six criteria: serious illness leading to hospitalization, an age of less than 21 years, fever that lasted for at least 24 hours, laboratory evidence of inflammation, multisystem organ involvement, and evidence of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), antibody testing, or exposure to persons with Covid-19 in the past month. Clinicians abstracted the data onto standardized forms. RESULTS: We report on 186 patients with MIS-C in 26 states. The median age was 8.3 years, 115 patients (62%) were male, 135 (73%) had previously been healthy, 131 (70%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or antibody testing, and 164 (88%) were hospitalized after April 16, 2020. Organ-system involvement included the gastrointestinal system in 171 patients (92%), cardiovascular in 149 (80%), hematologic in 142 (76%), mucocutaneous in 137 (74%), and respiratory in 131 (70%). The median duration of hospitalization was 7 days (interquartile range, 4 to 10); 148 patients (80%) received intensive care, 37 (20%) received mechanical ventilation, 90 (48%) received vasoactive support, and 4 (2%) died. Coronary-artery aneurysms (z scores &#8805;2.5) were documented in 15 patients (8%), and Kawasaki's disease-like features were documented in 74 (40%). Most patients (171 [92%]) had elevations in at least four biomarkers indicating inflammation. The use of immunomodulating therapies was common: intravenous immune globulin was used in 144 (77%), glucocorticoids in 91 (49%), and interleukin-6 or 1RA inhibitors in 38 (20%).

264433,Prioritizing antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 by integrating viral complete genome sequences and drug chemical structures,2021,"On account of the national closedown, the economy has suffered a severe slump. The reduced purchase of goods and services has lead to slow down of domestic manufacturing and agricultural sectors, leading to severe unemployment in urban industrial areas and contraction of the rural economy. This lockdown has influenced economy and business circumstance in India as it has occurred in other nations. The ongoing lockdown due to COVID-19 outbreak affects the Indian economy in many ways, including sharp declines in domestic demand, lower tourism and business travel, trade and production linkages, supply disruptions, and health effects. There are certain sectors that have been affected due to the outbreak of corona virus. This research paper, anticipates indicative measures that may be taken to revive the economy as well as affected sectors to some extent. First, this paper provides an overview of effect of this lockdown on Indian economy. With no manufacturing activity, it is likely that growth of gross domestic product (GDP) will be slowed down. This will be followed listing of the sectors affected due to COVID-19, which carries the risk of global supply chain disruptions. This includes five import items that are heavily dependent on China - electrical machinery, mechanical appliances, organic chemicals, plastics and surgical instruments – that make up about 28% of India’s import basket could be the mostly affected ones due to this potential shutdown. Next, the paper will present some of the indicative measures to revive the economy and rejuvenate the affected sectors. Protection of workers at the workplace must be given utmost priority followed by adapting to new work arrangements such as work-from-home (WFH). This will be followed by measures to stimulate the economy and labour demand by making and implementing active fiscal policy. Making expenditure on purchasing domestic goods and services will be the best way to push the economy. As a matter of fact, it is now may be required to evaluate on what can be produced here (in India) and give a deliberate thought to it towards implanting the same. Further, India will be at advantage by having domestically based and well established ‘pharma industry’. This sector may act as ‘catalyst sector’ towards economic growth of the country. © 2021 Karadeniz Technical University. All rights reserved.","Joshi, V. D.; Lakshmi, V. P.

METHODS: A randomized, cross-sectional study was performed to investigate the side effects of the BNT162b2 vaccine using an independent online questionnaire gathering responses from healthcare workers (HCWs) with detailed review of organ systems. RESULTS: Of all HCWs, 87.98% (1245/1415) completed the survey. Of them, 64.5% (803/1245) received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and reported at least one or more symptoms (classified based on organ systems and occurrence rate) post vaccination. Of these, 640/803 (79.7%) were able to continue activities of daily living (ADL), 103/803 (12.83%) had trouble temporarily to perform ADL, 99/803 (12.33%) took time off work temporarily, 20/803 (2.49%) required help from an outpatient provider, 5/803 (0.62%) required help from an emergency department and 2/803 (0.25%) required hospitalization. Despite this, 97.61% intended to have the second dose and 92.9% had already received it. CONCLUSIONS: Commonly reported symptoms (occurrence in descending order) were soreness, fatigue, myalgia, headache, chills, fever, joint pain, nausea, muscle spasm, sweating, dizziness, flushing, feelings of relief, brain fogging, anorexia, localized swelling, decreased sleep quality, itching, tingling, diarrhoea, nasal stuffiness and palpitations. Despite this, remarkable acceptance for the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine was found among HCWs.","Kadali, Renuka A K; Janagama, Ravali; Peruru, Sharanya; Malayala, Srikrishna V",Int J Infect Dis,,414

DIC can be a devastating systemic disorder. It is often markedly manifest on the skin as acrocyanosis or as petechiae and purpura with progression to hemorrhagic bullae. Subcutaneous hematomas may occur, as may thrombotic findings including necrosis and gangrene. The most common cause is infection, with special emphasis now on COVID-19. We have reviewed the medical literature under the search terms ""Disseminated intravascular coagulation"" and ""consumption coagulopathy"" for the past two decades in the English language using Medline and Google Scholar to update special concerns and considerations, focusing on those with COVID-19. Skin findings with DIC may be prominent. The severity of cutaneous lesions often correlates with the gravity of systemic disease. DIC is most effectively treated by addressing the underlying cause and resuscitating the patient using supportive measures. It is pivotal to recognize and treat DIC early, before deadly complications, such as multiple organ failure, arise.","Singh, Parmvir; Schwartz, Robert A",Dermatol Ther,,414

Using a questionnaire survey, we compare these two groups of teams in the areas of the concept of teamwork, team functionality, team management by its leader and motivation to perform in the context of the preparedness of the analyzed teams for home office. We found that greater negativity of teamwork as less productivity, or more demanding communication, is perceived by people from a private sector. Increased work from home in the private sector has improved communication and, in the public sector, work efficiency. In public sector, there is more frequent work control and feedback. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee ESJ, Italy.","Lajčin, D.; Porubčanová, D.",Emerging Science Journal,,414

When compared to non-immunocompromised patients, onco-hematological patients seem to have higher mortality rates. AIMS: We describe the characteristics and outcomes of a consecutive cohort of 24 onco-hematological patients with COVID-19 during the first month of the pandemic. We also describe variations in healthcare resource utilization within our hematology department. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from patients between the first month of the pandemic were retrospectively collected. Clinical and logistic data were also collected and compared with the average values from the prior 3 months of activity. Prevalence of COVID-19 in our hematological population was 0.4%. Baseline characteristics were as follows: male sex: 83%, lymphoid diseases: 46%, median age: 69 (22-82) years. Median follow-up in survivors was 14 (9-28) days and inpatient mortality rate was 46%. Average time to moderate/severe respiratory insufficiency and death were 3 (1-10) and 10 (3-18) days, respectively. Only 1 out of every 12 patients who developed moderate to severe respiratory insufficiency recovered. Upon univariate analysis, the following factors were associated with higher mortality: age &#8805; 70 years (P = .01) and D-dimer &#8805;900 mcg/L (P = .04). With respect to indirect effects during the COVID-19 pandemic, and when compared with the prior 3 months of activity, inpatient mortality (excluding patients with COVID-19 included in the study) increased by 56%. This was associated with a more frequent use of vasoactive drugs (+300%) and advanced respiratory support (+133%) in the hematology ward. In the outpatient setting, there was a reduction in initial visits (-55%) and chemotherapy sessions (-19%). A significant increase in phone visits was reported (+581%). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic is associated with elevated mortality in hematological patients. Negative indirect effects are also evident within this setting.","Condom, Maria; Mussetti, Alberto; Maluquer, Clara; Parody, Rocío; González-Barca, Eva; Arnan, Montserrat; Albasanz-Puig, Adaia; Pomares, Helena; Salas, Maria Queralt; Carro, Itziar; Peña, Marta; Clapes, Victòria; Baca Cano, Cristina; Oliveira Ramos, Ana Carla; Sanz-Linares, Gabriela; Moreno-González, Gabriel; Mercadal, Santiago; Boqué, Concepcion; Gudiol, Carlota; Domingo-Domènech, Eva; Sureda, Anna",Cancer Rep (Hoboken),,414
272271,Hyperinflammation bei SARS-CoV-2-Infektion,2020,"Proteoglycans (PGs) are one of the main components in the extracellular matrix of the central nervous system. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a glycosaminoglycan (GAG), which is composed of major PGs. Similar to keratin sulfate (KS), another GAG, CS inhibits axon regeneration. However, the influence of these GAGs on the pathogenicity of neuroimmunological diseases is unclear. Here, we induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice lacking CS N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-1 (CSGalNAcT1-KO), an important enzyme for CS synthesis. In our study, CSGalNAcT1-KO mice showed milder EAE symptoms than those in wild-type (WT) mice. The recall response of antigen-specific lymphocytes showed that CSGalNAcT1-KO-derived lymphocytes had a milder cell proliferation response than that in WT-derived lymphocytes. These results suggest that CS contributes toward the induction phase of EAE. We previously performed EAE experiments in GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase KO (GlcNAc6ST-KO) and C6ST1-KO mice, which had reduced KS and reduced CS-C, respectively. EAE in CSGalNAcT1-KO mice was more similar to that in GlcNAc6ST-KO mice than in C6ST1-KO mice. In conclusion, the distinct GAG sugar chains are associated with severe or mild phenotypes of EAE and are therefore potential new therapeutic targets for neuroimmunological diseases, including multiple sclerosis.","Inada, Rino; Miyamoto, Katsuichi; Tanaka, Noriko; Moriguchi, Kota; Kadomatsu, Kenji; Takeuchi, Kosei; Igarashi, Michihiro; Kusunoki, Susumu",Glycobiology,,414

The relationship between fatty liver and severity of the disease was also investigated by measuring the liver attenuation index (LAI). Methods: This study evaluated the chest CT images of 343 patients (201 male, mean age 48.43 years) who were confirmed to have COVID-19, using nasopharyngeal swab. The chest CTs were analyzed for laterality, number of involved lobes, diffuseness, number of lesions, and lesion types. The CT attenuation values of liver and spleen were measured, and LAI was calculated for the detection of hepatic steatosis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to identify the independent early predictors for severe COVID-19. Results: There was no significant difference between genders in terms of clinical course. Liver density and LAI were significantly lower in the intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The prevalence of severe disease was higher in the patients with hepatic steatosis than in the non-steatotic group (odds ratio [OR] 3.815, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.97-7.37, P < 0.001). After adjusting for age and comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic kidney disease, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was an independent risk factor for COVID-19 severity (OR 3.935, 95% CI 1.77-8.70, P = 0.001). The optimal cut-off value for LAI was calculated as 0.5 for predicting patients who required ICU treatment. Conclusions: On the initial chest CT images of COVID-19 patients, presence of fatty liver is a strong predictor for severe disease.","Parlak, Selçuk; Çivgin, Esra; Besler, Muhammed Said; Kayipmaz, Afsin Emre",Saudi J Gastroenterol,,414
274210,Structure Based Drug Repurposing Through Targeting Nsp9 Replicase and Spike Proteins of SARS-CoV-2,2020,"OBJECTIVES/INTRODUCTION: The Association of American Medical Colleges suggested that medical students not be involved in direct patient care activities in the United States because of the COVID pandemic. Our objectives are to (1) describe the rapid creation and implementation of a fully online simulation-based pediatric emergency medicine training intervention for medical student learners using existing simulation center staff (faculty, technicians, actors) and resources (simulation technology, scenario files) and (2) report student and faculty feedback on the intervention. METHODS: The sessions involved the use of our existing simulation center faculty, staff, and resources. Feedbacks on the sessions were collected via a survey from faculty and students at the end of each session. RESULTS: Sixteen simulation sessions were conducted (8 febrile infant, 8 anaphylactic toddler). Forty-eight students, 2 technicians, 2 actors, and 10 faculty participated. Ninety percent of the students agreed with the statements, ""I am more comfortable with pediatrics after this session,"" ""participating improved my pediatric knowledge/skills,"" ""this session was more useful than other learning activities I am involved in at this time."" Seventy percent of the students agreed with the statement, ""I learned as much from observing as when I was actively involved."" All faculty agreed with the statement, ""this was an effective educational strategy compared to other distance learning."" Most faculty (60%) disagreed with the statement, ""virtual simulation was equal to or superior to in-person simulation."" All students and faculty strongly agreed with the statement, ""I would highly recommend this to others."" CONCLUSIONS: A telesimulation intervention involving all medical students, staff, and facilitators interacting remotely for pediatric emergency training during COVID was associated with high levels of satisfaction by the majority of learners and faculty.","Yang, Thomas; Buck, Samuel; Evans, Leigh; Auerbach, Marc",Pediatr. emerg. care,,414

In this paper, we present simulation results obtained from the individual-based model, JO_SCPLOWUNEC_SCPLOW, for English school opening after a prior vaccination campaign using an optimistic set of assumptions about vaccine efficacy and the likelihood of prior-reinfection. We take a scenario-based approach to modelling potential interventions to assess relative changes rather than real-world forecasts. Specifically, we assess the effects of vaccinating those aged 16-17, those aged 12-17, and not vaccinating children at all relative to only vaccinating the adult population, addressing what might have happened had the UK began teenage vaccinations earlier. Vaccinating children in the 12-15 age group would have had a significant impact on the course of the epidemic, saving thousands of lives overall in these simulations. In the absence of such a vaccination campaign our simulations show there could still be a significant positive impact on the epidemic (fewer cases, fewer deaths) by continuing NPI strategies in schools. Our analysis suggests that the best results in terms of lives saved are likely derived from a combination of the now planned vaccination campaign and NPIs in schools.","Cuesta-Lazaro, Carolina; Quera-Bofarull, Arnau; Aylett-Bullock, Joseph; Lawrence, Bryan N.; Fong, Kevin; Icaza-Lizaola, Miguel; Aidan, Sedgewick; Truong, Henry; Vernon, Ian; Williams, Julian; Pagel, Christina; Krauss, Frank",,,414

The nurses' responsibilities were almost the same and worked in the general ward with no aerosol generating medical procedures. Two HCPs were expected to have similar infectiousness, but the number of secondary transmission by each HCP were different. Eleven close contacts from HCP1 were notified, and all of them tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. However, 13 of 35 close contacts of HCP2 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. While working, mask-wearing style differed between the two HCPs. HCP1 wore a KF94 mask appropriately and kept wearing it while working. HCP2 wore a surgical mask while working, but often pulled it down to her chin or removed it. It was strongly suspected that the difference of mask wearing contributed to the SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, other factors such as talkative behavior, exposure time, ventilation in rooms, and hand hygiene performance rates, could also have affected the transmission of COVID-19. It is crucial that healthcare workers wear a mask adequately and continuously, and they maintain proper hand hygiene while working during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lee, Ansaeng; Kim, Young Jun; Cho, Jihyeon; Lee, Jae Hoon",Braz J Infect Dis,,414

All reviewed articles were searched from December 11, 2019, to June 20, 2020, based on specific key words. Related findings in these articles show that the main target of COVID-19 is lung tissue, as after the virus enters the body, it mainly causes respiratory symptoms in affected patients. But in addition to respiratory symptoms, it is possible that, over time, these patients present with other symptoms, the most obvious of which are gastrointestinal symptoms. It is well documented that diarrhea and vomiting are the most common gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients. As part of this report, we also look at the incidence and frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients in Iran. The results can be used by providers as a guideline for better management of gastrointestinal symptoms in these patients.","Abbasinia, Mohammad; Hormati, Ahmad; Eshagh Hossaini, Seyed Kamal; Foroghi Ghomi, Seyed Yaser; Zamani, Farhad; Afifian, Mahboubeh; Ahmadpour, Sajjad",Gastroenterol Nurs,,414

The lockdown measures due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may change the social capital among youths. This study aimed to evaluate changes in social capital before and during COVID-19 lockdown among Chinese youths. It was based on the online COVID-19 Impact on Lifestyle Change Survey (COINLICS) conducted among 10 540 youths at three educational levels, including high/vocational school, undergraduate, and graduate, before and during COVID-19 lockdown. Measures of perceptions of social capital were adapted from a validated Chinese version of Health-related Social Capital Measurement based on youths' characteristics of living and studying environment. Social capital was measured at four dimensions, including individual social capital (ISC), family social capital (FSC), community social capital (CSC), and society social capital (SSC). Overall, compared to before lockdown, ISC and CSC scores decreased, while FSC and SSC scores increased during lockdown. When stratified by educational levels, the trends for each dimension of social capital were consistent with the overall population. There were 43.9%, 5.7%, 32.1%, and 3.7% of the participants showing decreased scores during lockdown for ISC, FSC, CSC, and SSC, respectively, while 7.2%, 24.0%, 15.3%, and 10.7% of participants showed increased scores for ISC, FSC, CSC, and SSC, respectively.

We calculate the annualized volatility per sector, screen the contents of the reports for stated effects of the pandemic on profits, and analyze stock price reactions in four different phases of the pandemic. The results show that stock markets have reacted with an increased price volatility. Manufacturers of fertilizers and agrochemicals as well as food distributors show particularly high volatilities in their stock prices. Low price volatility was observed in the stocks of food retailers. This pattern is also reflected in the profits of companies published in financial reports. Our regression analyses indicate that stocks of more profitable companies exhibited higher cumulative returns during the outbreak.

283052,Comparative sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 suggests its high transmissibility and pathogenicity,2021,"Corona virus is a virus that has the ability to penetrate the wall of the inner epithelial lining of the lungs, and thus spread fear and panic in the hearts of ordinary people, as well as researchers. And once this virus began to be active in infecting people, starting with China and the rest of the world, scientists and researchers worked to search for appropriate treatment and appropriate prevention methods to get rid of the infection caused by this deadly virus. It is imperative to know a set of concepts related to this topic, including the most important general characteristics of the Coronavirus, as well as the structural structure and behavior of the host cell, including the cells of lung tissue in the human respiratory system. And how the virus affects cellular respiration, which leads to human death. Our current research deals with studying the possibility of using some naturally extracted chemical compounds as an anti-virus, specifically corona virus, based on the fixed proportions and quantities through which the mechanical effect of these compounds on Corona virus is observed, depending on previous studies in this field.","Mahdi, Noor M.; Jawad, Ohood Salman",IOP Conference Series.

However, liver biochemical abnormality in COVID-19 patients with liver cirrhosis is under-recognized.Patients hospitalized during COVID-19 pandemic in China (ie, from February to April 2020) were screened. All of 17 COVID-19 patients with liver cirrhosis consecutively admitted to the Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital were identified. Meanwhile, 17 age-, sex-, and severity-matched COVID-19 patients without liver cirrhosis admitted to this hospital were selected as a control group; all of 14 cirrhotic patients without COVID-19 consecutively admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology of the General Hospital of Northern Theater Command were selected as another control group. Incidence of liver biochemical abnormality and decompensated events were primarily compared.Among the COVID-19 patients with liver cirrhosis, the incidence of liver biochemical abnormality at admission and during hospitalization were 76.50% and 84.60%, respectively; 7 (41.20%) had decompensated events at admission; 1 was transferred to intensive care unit due to gastrointestinal bleeding. Among the COVID-19 patients without liver cirrhosis, the incidence of liver biochemical abnormality at admission and during hospitalization were 58.80% (Pâ=â.271) and 60.00% (Pâ=â.150), respectively. Among the cirrhotic patients without COVID-19, the incidence of liver biochemical abnormality at admission and during hospitalization were 69.20% (Pâ=â.657) and 81.80% (Pâ=â.855), respectively; 11 (78.60%) had decompensated events at admission (Pâ=â.036). None died during hospitalization among the three groups.Liver biochemical abnormality is common in COVID-19 patients with liver cirrhosis.

This work reviews the use of gamification-based teaching during the pandemic lockdown through a search in Scopus, PsycINFO, ERIC, and Semantic Scholar databases. A total of 11 papers from Chemistry, Business, Computer Science, Biology, and Medical areas have been identified and included in the present work. All of them analyzed the use of gamification strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic and assessed student's learning and motivation outcomes. In general, students reported that gamification was innovative, engaging, and an efficient strategy to deliver curricula material;moreover, it was perceived as a fun activity. Some students reported that gamified videoconferences aided to connect with their classmates during isolation time providing effective social support. However, some students reported a bad physical or psychological condition, as consequence of the confinement, and did not get involved in the activity. Some weaknesses of the reviewed studies are the small sample size and its homogeneity, which makes it difficult to generalize their results to other scenarios and academic areas. Furthermore, although there is a feeling of learning during the activity, this result is mainly based on subjective perceptions, and any of the studies demonstrated that superior learning was achieved in comparison with traditional teaching strategies. Nevertheless, gamification can be implemented together with traditional lectures and can be a valuable instrument during post-COVID times.","Nieto-Escamez, F. A.; Roldan-Tapia, M.

The reported incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the context of COVID-19 is variable, and its mechanism is not well understood. Data are emerging about possible mechanisms of AKI including virus-induced cytopathic effect and cytokine storm-induced injury. To date, there have been few reports of kidney biopsy findings in the context of AKI in COVID-19 infection. This article describes 2 cases of collapsing glomerulopathy, 1 in a native kidney and, for the first time, 1 in a kidney transplant. Both individuals were black, and both presented without significant respiratory compromise. Indeed, the 2 patients we describe remained systemically well for the majority of their inpatient stay, which would support the hypothesis that for these patients, AKI was caused by a cytopathic viral effect, rather than that of a cytokine storm or acute tubular necrosis caused by prolonged hypovolaemia or the effect of medication known to exacerbate AKI. Here, we report 2 cases of AKI with collapsing glomerulopathy in COVID-19, one of which is in a kidney transplant recipient, not previously described elsewhere.","Noble, Rebecca; Tan, Mei Ying; McCulloch, Thomas; Shantier, Mohamed; Byrne, Catherine; Hall, Matthew; Jesky, Mark",Nephron,,414

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional research design was applied, which is a type of descriptive survey belonging to quantitative research. The sample was selected from various countries: Turkey, USA, France, Germany, Netherlands, Georgia, India, and South Africa. The total number of participants is 1020 people. The data were provided through the One-Way Anova Test and collected based on ""The Covid-19 Perception Questionnaire"" which contained 5 personal information and 10 items. Results: We found that statistically significant differences among the Covid-19 perceptions of individuals. The effect size showed that this difference is at a large level. As the variances did not evenly distribute, the Dunnett C multiple comparison tests were applied. According to this, the highest mean in Georgia and India, the lowest mean in Germany and the USA. Conclusion: The majority have the national and international awareness required to cope with the pandemic. However, the source of the virus has still not been explained so it has been observed that the number of people who believe in conspiracy theories is also high. As a result, people need more reliable sources of information, especially the World Health Organization should make more precise explanations to people about the origin of Covid-19 and updated information should be made available to people constantly.

Methods: A longitudinal follow-up investigation of 25 patients from a tertiary hospital in Henan provincial was conducted 8 weeks after discharge. Of these patients, 15 attended a second follow-up appointment 8 weeks after that. A throat swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis for SARS-CoV-2 and chest computerized tomography (CT) scans were implemented at the first follow-up appointment, and a total of 40 blood samples (25 from the first and 15 from the second follow-up appointment) were collected. Patients' levels of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody against S-Receptor binding domain (S-RBD) and Nucleocapsid Protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 and the subpopulation of lymphocytes were evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) test and flow cytometry, respectively. Results: At the first follow-up appointment, 10 of the 25 patients (40.0%) showed complete radiological resolution. Of these patients, 80.0% were classified as moderate, and 80.0% were younger (those whose age was ≤ the median age of all the patients). The predominant patterns of abnormalities included an irregular line (12/25, 48.0%), ground-glass opacity (GGO) (44.0%), and multiple GGOs (28.0%). At the first follow-up appointment, 40.0% (10/25) of patients still had lymphopenia. Of the 15 patients who were followed-up with twice, the ratio of lymphopenia was 80% (12/15), 60.0% (9/15), and 46.7% (7/15) at 0, 8, and 16 weeks after discharge, respectively. This was mainly due to a decrease in the cluster of differentiation (CD) 4+ T lymphocyte, which was observed in 60% (9/15), 60% (9/15), and 46.7% (7/15) of total patients at 0, 8, and 16 weeks after discharge, respectively. All of the patients were S-RBD and NP IgG antibody positive at the first follow-up appointment. 40.0% (6/15) and 66.7% (10/15) of patients showed a decrease over 50.0% in the level of NP and S-RBD IgG antibodies, respectively, at the second follow-up appointment. The NP and S-RBD IgG antibodies' levels declined to 44.6% (P=0.044) and 28.1% (P=0.18), respectively. 0 and 26.7% (4/15) of patients turned from NP and S-RBD IgG antibody positive to negative, respectively. Conclusions: About half of the patients still showed at least 1 abnormality in chest CT scans 8 weeks after discharge and lymphopenia 16 weeks after discharge. The level of the IgG antibody had declined by the follow-up appointment. Notably, the S-RBD IgG antibody declined more dramatically than that of NP. These results may have implications in the making of policies related to disease prevention, the long-term management of discharged patients, and vaccines' development.","Wang, Z.; Yang, L.; Chen, Y.; Xu, Z.; Wang, H.; Zhang, X.",Journal of Thoracic Disease,,414
292053,Site-specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 protein with a tailored titanium dioxide nanoparticle,2021,"Diagnosis of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a priority for all countries across the globe. Currently, reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis as no permanent solution is available. However effective this technique may be, research has emerged showing its limitations in detection and diagnosis especially when it comes to low abundant targets. In contrast, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), a recent emerging technology with superior advantages over qPCR, has been shown to overcome the challenges of RT-qPCR in diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 from low abundant target samples. Prospectively, in this article, the capabilities of RT-ddPCR are further expanded by showing steps on how to develop simplex, duplex, triplex probe mix, and quadruplex assays using a two-color detection system. Using primers and probes targeting specific sites of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (N, ORF1ab, RPP30, and RBD2), the development of these assays is shown to be possible. Additionally, step by step detailed protocols, notes, and suggestions on how to improve the assays workflow and analyze data are provided. Adapting this workflow in future works will ensure that the maximum number of targets can be sensitively detected in a small sample significantly improving on cost and sample throughput.","Nyaruaba, Raphael; Li, Xiaohong; Mwaliko, Caroline; Li, Changchang; Mwau, Matilu; Odiwour, Nelson; Muturi, Elishiba; Muema, Caroline; Li, Junhua; Yu, Junping; Wei, Hongping",J. vis. exp,,414

This report is of a 17-year-old girl with a history of marijuana use who presented with pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium and was found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on hospital admission by Abbott ID NOW testing. CASE REPORT A 17-year-old girl presented to the emergency room with a 3-day history of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting and a 1-day history of diarrhea. She had a history of daily marijuana use and lived with her grandmother who was presumed to be positive for COVID-19, based on symptoms. Her admission laboratory results were unremarkable except for pyuria, which was suspicious for urinary tract infection. The patient's nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Owing to abdominal pain, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained, which was concerning for pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium. A CT scan of the thorax confirmed the findings. A contrast-enhanced barium esophagogram was performed and was unremarkable. The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for observation and supportive care. CONCLUSIONS This report shows the importance of current testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients of all ages who present acutely to the hospital. It also highlights the importance of obtaining a full social and medical history so that symptoms and signs from causes other than SARS-CoV-2 infection are not missed.","Khan, Hamza Hassan; Witkowski, Alina; Clark, Jeff A; Mata, Angela",Am J Case Rep,,414

Many countries have imposed export restrictions on PPE to ensure the sufficient domestic supply. The surging demand and export restrictions cause shortage contagions on the global PPE trade network. Here, we develop an integrated network model, which integrates a metapopulation model and a threshold model, to investigate the shortage contagion patterns. The metapopulation model captures disease contagion across countries. The threshold model captures the shortage contagion on the global PPE trade network. Results show that, the shortage contagion patterns are mainly decided by top exporters. Export restrictions exacerbate the shortages of PPE and cause the shortage contagion to transmit even faster than the disease contagion. Besides, export restrictions lead to ineffective and inefficient allocation of PPE around the world, which has no benefits for the world to fight against the pandemic.","Ye, Yang; Zhang, Qingpeng; Cao, Zhidong; Chen, Frank Youhua; Yan, Houmin; Stanley, H.

To better understand the pathogenesis caused by SARS-CoV-2, we developed a rhesus macaque model to mimic natural infection via the nasal route, resulting in the SARS-CoV-2 virus shedding in the nose and stool up to 27 days. Importantly, we observed the pathological progression of marked interstitial pneumonia in the infected animals on 5-7 dpi, with virus dissemination widely occurring in the lower respiratory tract and lymph nodes, and viral RNA was consistently detected from 5 to 21 dpi. During the infection period, the kinetics response of T cells was revealed to contribute to COVID-19 progression. Our findings implied that the antiviral response of T cells was suppressed after 3 days post infection, which might be related to increases in the Treg cell population in PBMCs. Moreover, two waves of the enhanced production of cytokines (TGF-&#945;, IL-4, IL-6, GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-15, IL-1ß), chemokines (MCP-1/CCL2, IL-8/CXCL8, and MIP-1ß/CCL4) were detected in lung tissue.

Likewise, one concern which was initially overlooked was for the pregnant women and the new-born child’s health during the pandemic. With recent reports of an excessive increase in pregnancy during lockdown, it is a critical area to consider that whether there is a chance of vertical transmission of the infectious disease from the mother to the fetus. Methods: Using narrative review approach the present study endeavored in highlighting the importance of protecting expecting mothers and their infants upon birth from COVID-19. The study collected all the relevant literature on the matter of pregnancy during COVID-19 and its impact using key terms such as pregnancy, COVID-19, vertical transmission Moreover, the study tried suggesting recommendations based on literature review. Results: It can be inferred that though currently not enough evidence has been brought into light to suggest pregnant mothers or the infant children as vulnerable, however proper precautionary measures must be taken during these testing times to subdue the imminent threat coronavirus can brought on to the mother or child. Conclusions: The current study is an attempt to call out to the official authorities and health professionals to develop policies and interventions to support the mother and child during the birthing process and take in consideration the suggested recommendations.","Kanwar Hamza, Shuja Sohaib Shahid Mehak Haroon Rauf Aneeqa",Foundation University Journal of Psychology,,414
299769,Bioinformatic prediction of potential T cell epitopes for SARS-Cov-2,2020,"In this study, we aimed at analyzing the associations between transmission of and deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2 and meteorological variables, such as average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation. Two outcome measures were considered, with the first aiming to study SARS-CoV-2 infections and the second aiming to study COVID-19 mortality. Daily data as well as data on SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 mortality obtained between December 1, 2019 and March 28, 2020 were collected from weather stations around the world. The country's population density and time of exposure to the disease were used as control variables. Finally, a month dummy variable was added. Daily data by country were analyzed using the panel data model. An increase in the average daily temperature by one degree Fahrenheit reduced the number of cases by approximately 6.4 cases/day. There was a negative correlation between the average temperature per country and the number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections. This association remained strong even with the incorporation of additional variables and controls (maximum temperature, average temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation) and fixed country effects. There was a positive correlation between precipitation and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Countries with higher rainfall measurements showed an increase in disease transmission. For each average inch/day, there was an increase of 56.01 cases/day. COVID-19 mortality showed no significant association with temperature.","Sobral, Marcos Felipe Falcão; Duarte, Gisleia Benini; da Penha Sobral, Ana Iza Gomes; Marinho, Marcelo Luiz Monteiro; de Souza Melo, André",Sci Total Environ,,414

302099,In silico structure modelling of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 helicase and Nsp14 and repurposing of FDA approved antiviral drugs as dual inhibitors,2020,"Purpose Reshoring is one of the supply chain risk management techniques suggested in literature. However, literature suggests that the decision-making involved in reshoring is complex and not fully understood. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, reshoring may represent a way to reduce reliance on global sources and improve resilience of their supply chains. This paper aims to explore if the pandemic is driving reshoring decisions and if the pandemic will actually lead to companies reshoring parts of their supply chain. Design/methodology/approach This paper critically engages with senior(-most) supply chain managers from three manufacturing companies as they proceed through reshoring decision-making. This enables to develop experiential knowledge about reshoring decision-making processes and their context, as well as insights into the relevance of existing knowledge about reshoring. While not a full multiple case study, the opportunity to engage directly with senior(-most) supply chain managers as they consider reshoring, enables near real-time learning. Not only is reshoring a very timely topic literature has also called for more event-based empirical research. Further to that, it is hoped that this can complement this special issue and support, in a timely manner, the many researchers that are actively studying the impact of the pandemic on supply chains. Findings Reshoring was being actively considered by all three companies during the research process in Q3 and Q4 of 2020. During this period the pandemic has not yet led to substantial implementation of reshoring, at least by the companies studied in this paper. In response to tariffs on Chinese imports, companies had been diversifying their supply base away from China, but doing so by developing alternative, global sources. Additionally, companies are using alternative risk management techniques, such as supplier collaboration, in the short to medium term. Reshoring decision-making is indeed found to be complex and requires a longer-term time horizon for decision-making and implementation. Logistical challenges and growth in demand do drive a willingness of consumers to pay a premium for locally sourced products. However, when supply normalizes these considerations might lose relevance well before reshoring decision-making and implementation can be completed. Originality/value This paper studies reshoring in a real-world setting, learning directly from insights from industry as they emerge. This paper develops four extensions to existing knowledge, develop these in frameworks and hope that this will support ongoing consideration in industry and support the many researchers that are active in this domain today. This paper also suggests several directions for further research.","van Hoek, R.; Dobrzykowski, D.",Supply Chain Management-an International Journal,,414
302177,No evidence for increased transmissibility from recurrent mutations in SARS-CoV-2,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The aim is to review current literature related to the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of suspected and confirmed Covid-19 cases. KEY FINDINGS: Medical Imaging plays an important auxiliary role in the diagnosis of Covid-19 patients, mainly those most seriously affected. Practice differs widely among different countries, mainly due to the variability of access to resources (viral testing and imaging equipment, specialised staff, protective equipment). It has been now well-documented that chest radiographs should be the first-line imaging tool and chest CT should only be reserved for critically ill patients, or when chest radiograph and clinical presentation may be inconclusive. CONCLUSION: As radiographers work on the frontline, they should be aware of the potential risks associated with Covid-19 and engage in optimal strategies to reduce these. Their role in vetting, conducting and often reporting the imaging examinations is vital, as well as their contribution in patient safety and care. Medical Imaging should be limited to critically ill patients, and where it may have an impact on the patient management plan. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: At the time of publication, this review offers the most up-to-date recommendations for clinical practitioners in radiology departments, including radiographers. Radiography practice has to significantly adjust to these new requirements to support optimal and safe imaging practices for the diagnosis of Covid-19. The adoption of low dose CT, rigorous infection control protocols and optimal use of personal protective equipment may reduce the potential risks of radiation exposure and infection, respectively, within Radiology departments.","Stogiannos, N; Fotopoulos, D; Woznitza, N; Malamateniou, C",Radiography (Lond),,414

Since then, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported in more than 180 countries with approximately 6.5 million known infections and more than 380,000 deaths attributed to this disease as of June 3rd , 2020 (Johns Hopkins University COVID map; https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) The majority of confirmed COVID-19 cases have been reported in adults, especially older individuals with co-morbidities. Children have had a relatively lower rate and a less serious course of infection as reported in the literature to date. One of the most vulnerable pediatric patient populations is cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit. There is limited data on the effect of COVID-19 in fetal life, and among neonates after birth. Therefore there is an urgent need for proactive preparation, and planning to combat COVID-19, as well as to safeguard patients, their families, and healthcare personnel. This review article is based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) current recommendations for COVID-19 and its adaptation to our local resources. The aim of this article is to provide basic consolidated guidance and checklists to clinicians in the neonatal intensive care units in key aspects of preparation needed to counter exposure or infection with COVID-19. We anticipate that CDC will continue to update their guidelines regarding COVID-19 as the situation evolves, and we recommend monitoring CDC's updates for the most current information.","Verma, Sourabh; Lumba, Rishi; Lighter, Jennifer L; Bailey, Sean M; Wachtel, Elena V; Kunjumon, Bgee; Alessi, Samantha; Mally, Pradeep V",Curr Probl Pediatr Adolesc Health Care,,414
302273,Learning from HIV-1 to predict the immunogenicity of T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2,2021,"Purpose : While one might expect that universal masking would decrease the risk of oral flora contamination during the injection procedure, anecdotal reports of oral flora-related endophthalmitis during COVID-19 have emerged. We performed a prospective observational cohort study to determine the effect of taping the top of face masks on air particle counts directed toward the eye during simulated intravitreal injections. Methods : Thirteen healthy N95 qualitative fit tested human subjects were recruited, three women and ten men, with an age range of [24, 35]. Each wore a cloth, surgical, or N95 mask in randomized order. The number of air particles were quantified using a particle counter suspended over the right eye while each subject breathed normally, deeply, or spoke using a standardized script. Particle counts were obtained with the top of each mask taped and untaped. The main outcome measurements were particle counts in the size classes of 0.3 mm, 0.5 mm, 1 mm, 3 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, and total particle count. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to test for paired differences between taped and untaped particle counts for each combination of mask type and respiratory mode, at each particle size. Results : Taping cloth masks while subjects were speaking significantly reduced particle counts for the size classes of 0.3 mm (p=0.03), 0.5 mm (p=0.01), 1 mm (p=0.03), and total particle counts (p=0.008) compared to no taping. Taping the top of cloth masks during normal or deep breathing did not significantly affect particle counts compared to no taping. Taping the top of surgical or N95 masks did not significantly alter particle counts for any breathing condition tested. Conclusions : Taping the top of cloth masks prior to simulated intravitreal injections significantly reduced air particle counts directed toward the eye when subjects were speaking compared to no taping. This may have implications for decreasing air particles reaching the eye during intravitreal injections, including aerosolized droplets from a patient's mouth that may carry oral pathogens.","Schultheis, W.; Zhang, Q.; Sharpe, J.; Patel, S.; Kuriyan, A.

302579,SARS-CoV-2 infection rewires host cell metabolism and is potentially susceptible to mTORC1 inhibition,2021,"High-quality data is critical to train performant Machine Learning (ML) models, highlighting the importance of Data Quality Management (DQM). Existing DQM schemes often cannot satisfactorily improve ML performance because, by design, they are oblivious to downstream ML tasks. Besides, they cannot handle various data quality issues (especially those caused by adversarial attacks) and have limited applications to only certain types of ML models. Recently, data valuation approaches (e.g., based on the Shapley value) have been leveraged to perform DQM; yet, empirical studies have observed that their performance varies considerably based on the underlying data and training process. In this paper, we propose a task-driven, multi-purpose, model-agnostic DQM framework, DataSifter, which is optimized towards a given downstream ML task, capable of effectively removing data points with various defects, and applicable to diverse models. Specifically, we formulate DQM as an optimization problem and devise a scalable algorithm to solve it. Furthermore, we propose a theoretical framework for comparing the worst-case performance of different DQM strategies. Remarkably, our results show that the popular strategy based on the Shapley value may end up choosing the worst data subset in certain practical scenarios. Our evaluation shows that DataSifter achieves and most often significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance over a wide range of DQM tasks, including backdoor, poison, noisy/mislabel data detection, data summarization, and data debiasing.","Wang, Tianhao; Zeng, Yi; Jin, Ming; Jia, Ruoxi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05484v1.pdf,414
303312,Identification of SARS-CoV-2 CTL epitopes for development of a multivalent subunit vaccine for COVID-19,2021,"Telemedicine (TM) enabled by digital health technologies to provide medical services has been considered a key solution to increasing health care access in rural communities. With the immediate need for remote care due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many health care systems have rapidly incorporated digital technologies to support the delivery of remote care options, including medication treatment for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). In responding to the opioid crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, public health officials and scientific communities strongly support and advocate for greater use of TM-based medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD) to improve access to care and have suggested that broad use of TM during the pandemic should be sustained. Nevertheless, research on the implementation and effectiveness of TM-based MOUD has been limited. To address this knowledge gap, the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) funded (via the NIH HEAL Initiative) a study on Rural Expansion of Medication Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder (Rural MOUD; CTN-0102) to investigate the implementation and effectiveness of adding TM-based MOUD to rural primary care for expanding access to MOUD. In preparation for this large-scale, randomized controlled trial incorporating TM in rural primary care, a feasibility study is being conducted to develop and pilot test implementation procedures. In this commentary, we share some of our experiences, which include several challenges, during the initial two-month period of the feasibility study phase. While these challenges could be due, at least in part, to adjusting to the COVID-19 pandemic and new workflows to accommodate the study, they are notable and could have a substantial impact on the larger, planned pragmatic trial and on TM-based MOUD more broadly. Challenges include low rates of identification of risk for OUD from screening, low rates of referral to TM, digital device and internet access issues, workflow and capacity barriers, and insurance coverage. These challenges also highlight the lack of empirical guidance for best TM practice and quality remote care models. With TM expanding rapidly, understanding implementation and demonstrating what TM approaches are effective are critical for ensuring the best care for persons with OUD.","Hser, Yih-Ing; Ober, Allison J; Dopp, Alex R; Lin, Chunqing; Osterhage, Katie P; Clingan, Sarah E; Mooney, Larissa J; Curtis, Megan E; Marsch, Lisa A; McLeman, Bethany; Hichborn, Emily; Lester, Laurie S; Baldwin, Laura-Mae; Liu, Yanping; Jacobs, Petra; Saxon, Andrew J",Addict Sci Clin Pract,,414

After critical illness, patients often suffer post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), which encompasses physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that are often long-lasting barriers to resuming a meaningful life. Some deficits after COVID-19 critical illness will require otolaryngologic expertise for years after hospital discharge. There are roles for all subspecialties in preventing, diagnosing, or treating sequelae of COVID-19. Otolaryngologist leadership in multidisciplinary efforts ensures coordinated care. Timely tracheostomy, when indicated, may shorten the course of intensive care unit stay and thereby potentially reduce the impairments associated with PICS. Otolaryngologists can provide expertise in olfactory disorders; thrombotic sequelae of hearing loss and vertigo; and laryngotracheal injuries that impair speech, voice, swallowing, communication, and breathing. In the aftermath of severe COVID-19, otolaryngologists are poised to lead efforts in early identification and intervention for impairments affecting patients' quality of life.","Pandian, Vinciya; Brodsky, Martin B; Brigham, Emily P; Parker, Ann M; Hillel, Alexander T; Levy, Joshua M; Rassekh, Christopher H; Lalwani, Anil K; Needham, Dale M; Brenner, Michael J",Am J Otolaryngol,,414

METHODS: A total of 976 patients admitted to the emergency department of our hospital and had undergone neurology consultation during a 6-month period were evaluated. The reasons for consultation, the number of patients consulted, hospitalization counts, and imaging studies for neurological assessment including computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were recorded and compared. RESULTS: Compared to the pre-pandemic period, there were significant decreases in the number of neurological consultations requested by the emergency department (overall and related to stroke, seizure and other reasons) and the number of patients hospitalized in the neurology department. We also found that the number of orders for cranial CT and MRI images during the pandemic period had decreased significantly. CONCLUSION: Restrictions, social isolation measures and patients' reluctance to apply to hospitals to avoid contact with possibly infected people may have led to a decrease in the number of patients with neurological symptoms admitted to the emergency department and the number of hospitalized patients.","Haki, Cemile; Kaya, Halil",Acta neurol.

Without adequate access to healthy foods, weight maintenance can be hindered. OBJECTIVE: Examine influence degree of food access has on Appalachian bariatric surgery patient weight loss outcomes. SETTING: Appalachian University hospital, United States. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was used to examine the influence of food accessibility on weight loss outcomes in an Appalachian bariatric surgery patient population at a large tertiary hospital in West Virginia between 2013 and 2017. Demographic characteristics, health and family history, and 1-year surgery outcomes were collected. A state-specific food accessibility score was calculated for each patient address using the geographic information system. Patients were assigned a food access ranking score (FARS) between 0 (low food access) and 4 (high food access) based on criteria of quantity, quality, income, and vehicle access. RESULTS: Patients (n = 369) were predominately married (60.5%), white (92.4%), female (77.8%), and underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (75.9%), with a mean age of 45 years. Most patients had low FARS (M = 1.67 ± .73; 72.6%). Nonwhite patients (P = .03) with a preoperative diagnosis of depression (P = .02) or without a family history of obesity (P = .01) were found to be in the lower FARS categories. FARS was not indicative of weight loss post surgery (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Food accessibility in West Virginia was not associated with bariatric surgery weight outcomes at 1-year post operation. Lower food access was associated with nonwhite race/ethnicity, diagnosed depression at baseline, and no family history of obesity. Future studies should include more extended follow-up data collection and mixed-method approaches to capture perceptions of food access and its impact on the patients' postoperative journey.","Barr, M L; Tabone, L E; Brode, C; Szoka, N",Surg. obes. relat. dis,,414

In Sri Lanka, a developing country located in South Asia, it was possible to observe a range of events that arose due to the influence of the COVID-19 virus outbreak. Thus, the people of Sri Lanka used Social Media to voice their opinions regarding such events and those involved in them, enabling the ideal avenue to explore the social perception. However, the outcome of such actions was at certain times detrimental. This study was conducted as an attempt to identify the reasons for such instances as well as to identify the behaviours of the Sri Lankan populace during such a crisis event. To support this study, observations, as well as data of related posts from a sample of 50 sources, were manually collected from the most popular social media platform in Sri Lanka, Facebook. The posts considered spanned until approximately a month after the initial major virus outbreak in the country and contained content that even vaguely related to the virus.

Social determinants of health are powerful drivers of health outcomes that could influence COVID-19 racial disparities. METHODS: We collected data from publicly available databases on COVID-19 death rates through October 28, 2020, clinical covariates, and social determinants of health indicators at the U.S. county level. We utilized negative binomial regression to assess the association between social determinants of health and COVID-19 mortality focusing on racial disparities in mortality. RESULTS: Counties with higher death rates had a higher proportion of Black residents and greater levels of adverse social determinants of health. A one percentage point increase in percent Black residents, percent uninsured adults, percent low birthweight, percent adults without high school diploma, incarceration rate, and percent households without internet in a county increased COVID-19 death rates by 0.9% (95% CI 0.5%-1.3%), 1.9% (95% CI 1.1%-2.7%), 7.6% (95% CI 4.4%-11.0%), 3.5% (95% CI 2.5%-4.5%), 5.4% (95% CI 1.3%-9.7%), and 3.4% (95% CI 2.5%-4.2%), respectively. Counties in the lowest quintile of a measure of economic privilege had an increased COVID-19 death rates of 67.5% (95% CI 35.9%-106.6%). Multivariate regression and subgroup analyses suggested that adverse social determinants of health may partially explain racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that social determinants of health contribute to COVID-19 mortality for Black Americans at the county level, highlighting the need for public health policies that address racial disparities in health outcomes.","Dalsania, Ankur K; Fastiggi, Matthew J; Kahlam, Aaron; Shah, Rajvi; Patel, Krishan; Shiau, Stephanie; Rokicki, Slawa; DallaPiazza, Michelle",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,414

Kidney disease, usually presenting as acute kidney injury (AKI), is particularly severe among patients with COVID-19. It is unknown, however, whether such injury results from direct kidney infection with COVID-19's causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or from indirect mechanisms. Methods Using ex vivo cell models, we sought to analyze SARS-Cov2 interactions with kidney tubular cells and assess direct tubular injury. These models comprised primary human kidney epithelial cells (derived from nephrectomies and grown as proliferating monolayers) and more quiescent three-dimensional kidney spheroids. Results We demonstrated that viral entry molecules and high baseline levels of type 1 interferon-related molecules were present in monolayers and kidney spheroids. Although both models support viral infection and replication, they did not exhibit a cytopathic effect and cell death, outcomes that were strongly present in SARS-CoV-2-infected controls (Vero E6 cultures). A comparison of monolayer and spheroid cultures demonstrated higher infectivity and replication of SARS-Cov-2 in actively proliferating monolayers, although the spheroid cultures exhibited higher levels of ACE2. Monolayers exhibited elevation of some tubular injury molecules-including molecules related to fibrosis (COL1A1 and STAT6) and dedifferentiation (SNAI2)-as well as a loss of cell identity, evident by reduction in megalin (LRP2). The three-dimensional spheroids were less prone to such injury. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 can infect kidney cells without a cytopathic effect. AKI-induced cellular proliferation may potentially intensify infectivity and tubular damage by SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that early intervention in AKI is warranted to help minimize kidney infection.","Omer, Dorit; Pleniceanu, Oren; Gnatek, Yehudit; Namestnikov, Michael; Cohen-Zontag, Osnat; Goldberg, Sanja; Friedman, Yehudit Eden; Friedman, Nehemya; Mandelboim, Michal; Vitner, Einat; Achdout, Hagit; Avraham, Roy; Zahavy, Eran; Israely, Tomer; Mayan, Haim; Dekel, Benjamin",J.

321971,An automatic pipeline for the design of irreversible derivatives identifies a potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor,2021,"ACE2 is a type I membrane protein with extracellular carboxypeptidase activity displaying a broad tissue distribution with highest expression levels at the brush border membrane (BBM) of small intestine enterocytes and a lower expression in stomach and colon. In small intestinal mucosa, ACE2 mRNA expression appears to increase with age and to display higher levels in patients taking ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I). There, ACE2 protein heterodimerizes with the neutral amino acid transporter Broad neutral Amino acid Transporter 1 (B0AT1) (SLC6A19) or the imino acid transporter Sodium-dependent Imino Transporter 1 (SIT1) (SLC6A20), associations that are required for the surface expression of these transport proteins. These heterodimers can form quaternary structures able to function as binding sites for SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins. The heterodimerization of the carboxypeptidase ACE2 with B0AT1 is suggested to favor the direct supply of substrate amino acids to the transporter, but whether this association impacts the ability of ACE2 to mediate viral infection is not known. B0AT1 mutations cause Hartnup disorder, a condition characterized by neutral aminoaciduria and, in some cases, pellagra-like symptoms, such as photosensitive rash, diarrhea, and cerebellar ataxia. Correspondingly, the lack of ACE2 and the concurrent absence of B0AT1 expression in small intestine causes a decrease in l-tryptophan absorption, niacin deficiency, decreased intestinal antimicrobial peptide production, and increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mice. Thus, the abundant expression of ACE2 in small intestine and its association with amino acid transporters appears to play a crucial role for the digestion of peptides and the absorption of amino acids and, thereby, for the maintenance of structural and functional gut integrity.","Camargo, Simone M R; Vuille-Dit-Bille, Raphael N; Meier, Chantal F; Verrey, François",Clin Sci (Lond),,414

The World Health Organization suggested social distancing to curb the community spread. After national social lockdown started in India, air quality improved drastically. This further hypothesized to influence the environment and human health, and this study is positively the first to weigh it using multiple indices. The calculated environmental indices are photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP), acidification potential (AP), and eutrophication potential (EP). The cancer risk, chronic health index (CHI), and acute health index (AHI) were considered to calculate the health risk. The spatial trend change in the air pollution reflecting on these indices are calculated for four Indian megacities Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Kolkata. Temporal variation was accounted for monthly (2019 vs 2020), one-week and two-weeks period during the social lockdown. The results showed a significant decrease in environmental and health risk during the lockdown due to a corresponding decrement in air pollution. The decrease in the particulate matter was found to play a vital role in altering the air pollution mediated risks of interest. Delhi showed a maximum difference in POCP and Acute HI by recording a dip of 70.79% and 43.53% respectively in 2020 during lockdown. The maximum reduction in health risk indices was 41%, 31%, 17%, 19% for Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Kolkata. Bangalore recorded the maximum decline in EP, Cancer risk, Chronic HI by 66.66%, 58.62%, and 58.76% in 2020 compared to 2019. A maximum fall in AP was seen in Kolkata by 57.23% in 2020 among all cities. The connection between these drop-in indices and the cause of air pollutants were well discussed.

By the end of May, more than 6 million people were diagnosed with this infection. Twitter witnessed an outpouring of anxious tweets through messages associated with the spread of the virus. Government and health officials replied to the troubling tweets, reassuring the public with regular alerts on the virus's progress and information to defend against the virus. We observe that social media users are worried about Covid 19-related crisis and we identify three separate conversations on virus contagion, prevention, and the economy. We analyze the tone of officials' tweet text as alarming and reassuring and capture the response of Twitter users to official communications. Such studies can provide insights to health officials and government agencies for crisis management, specifically regarding communicating emergency information to the public via social media for establishing reassurance.","Rao, H Raghav; Vemprala, Naga; Akello, Patricia; Valecha, Rohit",Int J Inf Manage,,414

METHODS: This cohort study from the Cerner Real World Database (87 US health systems) from December 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020 included PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who self-identified as non-Hispanic Black (Black), Hispanic White (Hispanic), or non-Hispanic White (White). The main outcome was hospitalization among ED patients. Secondary outcomes included mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit care, and in-hospital mortality. Descriptive statistics and Poisson regression compared sociodemographics, comorbidities, receipt of remdesivir, receipt of dexamethasone, and outcomes by racial/ethnic groups and geographic region. RESULTS: 94,683 COVID-19 patients presented to the ED. Blacks comprised 26.7% and Hispanics 33.6%. Nearly half (45.1%) of ED patients presented to hospitals in the South. 31.4% (n=29,687) were hospitalized. Lower proportions of Blacks were prescribed dexamethasone (29.4%; n=7,426) compared to Hispanics (40.9%; n=13,021) and Whites (37.5%; n=14,088). Hospitalization risks, compared to Whites, were similar in Blacks (Risk Ratio (RR)=0.94; 95% CI:0.82, 1.08; p=0.4)) and Hispanics RR=0.99 (95% CI:0.81, 1.21; p=0.91), but risk of in-hospital mortality was higher in Blacks, RR=1.18 (95% CI:1.06, 1.31; p=0.002) and Hispanics, RR=1.28 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.44; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Minority patients were overrepresented among COVID-19 ED patients, and while they had similar risks of hospitalization as Whites, in-hospital mortality risk was higher. Interventions targeting upstream social determinants of health are needed to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19.","Wiley, Zanthia; Ross-Driscoll, Katie; Wang, Zhensheng; Smothers, Laken; Mehta, Aneesh K; Patzer, Rachel E",Clin. infect. dis,,414

336026,Discovery of Potent SARS-CoV-2 Inhibitors from Approved Antiviral Drugs via Docking Screening,2020,"Changes in people's behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic can be regarded as the result of two types of effects: the ""intervention effect"" (changes resulting from government orders for people to change their behavior) and the ""information effect"" (voluntary changes in people's behavior based on information about the pandemic). Using age-specific mobile location data, we examine how the intervention and information effects differ across age groups. Our main findings are as follows. First, the age profile of the intervention effect shows that the degree to which people refrained from going out was smaller for older age groups, who are at a higher risk of serious illness and death, than for younger age groups. Second, the age profile of the information effect shows that the degree to which people stayed at home tended to increase with age for weekends and holidays. Thus, while Acemoglu et al. (2020) proposed targeted lockdowns requiring stricter lockdown policies for the oldest group in order to protect those at a high risk of serious illness and death, our findings suggest that Japan's government intervention had a very different effect in that it primarily reduced outings by the young, and what led to the quarantining of older groups at higher risk instead was people's voluntary response to information about the pandemic. Third, the information effect has been on a downward trend since the summer of 2020. It is relatively more pronounced among the young, so that the age profile of the information effect remains upward sloping.","Watanabe, Tsutomu; Yabu, Tomoyoshi",Jpn Econ Rev (Oxf),,414

Diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently established with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test by means of oropharyngeal-, nasopharyngeal-, anal-swabs, sputum and blood plasma. However, oral and nasal swabs are more commonly used. This study, therefore, assessed sensitivity and specificity of plasma as a diagnostic in comparison with a combination of oral and nasal swab samples, and the implications for blood transfusion. Oropharyngeal (OP) and nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples were obtained from 125 individuals suspected to have COVID-19 and stored in viral transport medium (VTM) tubes. Ten millilitres of blood samples in EDTA were also obtained by venepuncture and spun to obtain plasma. Viral RNA was obtained from both swabs and plasma by manual extraction with Qiagen QIAamp viral RNA Mini Kit. Detection was done using a real time fluorescent RT-qPCR BGI kit, on a QuantStudio 3 real-time PCR instrument. Average age of study participants was 41 years, with 74 (59.2%) being male. Out of the 125 individuals tested for COVID-19, 75 (60%) were positive by OP/NP swab. However, only 6 (4.8%) had a positive plasma result for COVID-19 with median Ct value of 32.4. Sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test using plasma was 8% and 100% respectively. There was no false positive recorded, but 69 (55.2%) false negatives were obtained by plasma. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected, albeit low (4.8%) in plasma. Plasma is likely not a suitable biological sample to diagnose acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Here, we assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of nosocomial Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). METHODS: We retrospectively compared the incidence density (cases per 10,000 patient days) of healthcare-facility-associated (HCFA) CDI in a tertiary-care hospital in Madrid, Spain, during the maximum incidence of COVID-19 (March 11 to May 11, 2020) with the same period of the previous year (control period). We also assessed the aggregate in-hospital antibiotic use (ie, defined daily doses [DDD] per 100 occupied bed days [BD]) and incidence density (ie, movements per 1,000 patient days) of patient mobility during both periods. RESULTS: In total, 2,337 patients with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to the hospital during the COVID-19 period. Also, 12 HCFA CDI cases were reported at this time (incidence density, 2.68 per 10,000 patient days), whereas 34 HCFA CDI cases were identified during the control period (incidence density, 8.54 per 10,000 patient days) (P = .000257). Antibiotic consumption was slightly higher during the COVID-19 period (89.73 DDD per 100 BD) than during the control period (79.16 DDD per 100 BD). The incidence density of patient movements was 587.61 per 1,000 patient days during the control period and was significantly lower during the COVID-19 period (300.86 per 1,000 patient days) (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: The observed reduction of ~70% in the incidence density of HCFA CDI in a context of no reduction in antibiotic use supports the importance of reducing nosocomial transmission by healthcare workers and asymptomatic colonized patients, reinforcing cleaning procedures and reducing patient mobility in the epidemiological control of CDI.","Ponce-Alonso, Manuel; Sáez de la Fuente, Javier; Rincón-Carlavilla, Angela; Moreno-Nunez, Paloma; Martínez-García, Laura; Escudero-Sánchez, Rosa; Pintor, Rosario; García-Fernández, Sergio; Cobo, Javier",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,414

Such age-choosing was quickly flagged as discriminatory, and so some states and hospitals shifted to embedding age as a tiebreaker deeper in their plans. Different rationales were given for using age as a tiebreaker: (1) that younger patients were more likely to survive than older patients, (2) that saving younger patients would save more life-years, (3) that younger patients deserved a chance to live through life's stages. We provide a critical analysis of these three rationales, noting the differences between them, and then questioning the ethical and legal justifications for such age-choosing.","Brown, Teneille R; Francis, Leslie P; Tabery, James",Hastings Cent. rep,,414

For the laboratory indicators at admission the following were higher in non-survivors with influenza than in those without influenza: white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, levels of tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, D-dimer value, and proportion of elevated creatinine. CONCLUSION: The results showed that a high proportion of COVID-19 patients were co-infected with influenza in Tongji Hospital, with no significant difference in the proportion of co-infection between survivors and non-survivors. The critically ill COVID-19 patients with influenza exhibited more severe inflammation and organ injury, indicating that co-infection with the influenza virus may induce an earlier and more frequently occurring cytokine storm.","Ma, Simin; Lai, Xiaoquan; Chen, Zhe; Tu, Shenghao; Qin, Kai",Int J Infect Dis,,414

Using a sample of banks from 125 countries, we apply a difference-in-difference methodology and find that bank lending is weaker in countries that are more affected by the health crisis. This effect depends on the bank's financial conditions, market structure, regulatory and institutional environment, financial intermediary and debt market development, ease of access of corporate firms to debt capital, and the response of the public health sector to the crisis.","Ҫolak, Gönül Öztekin Özde",Journal of Banking &amp; Finance,,414

345143,Characterization of codon usage pattern in SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Cordycepin is the major bioactive component extracted from Cordyceps militaris. In recent years, cordycepin has received increasing attention owing to its multiple pharmacological activities. This study reviews recent researches on the anti-inflammatory effects and the related activities of cordycepin. The results from our review indicate that cordycepin exerts protective effects against inflammatory injury for many diseases including acute lung injury (ALI), asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson's disease (PD), hepatitis, atherosclerosis, and atopic dermatitis. Cordycepin regulates the NF-&#954;B, RIP2/Caspase-1, Akt/GSK-3ß/p70S6K, TGF-ß/Smads, and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways among others. Several studies focusing on cordycepin derivatives were reviewed and found to down metabolic velocity of cordycepin and increase its bioavailability. Moreover, cordycepin enhanced immunity, inhibited the proliferation of viral RNA, and suppressed cytokine storms, thereby suggesting its potential to treat COVID-19 and other viral infections. From the collected and reviewed information, this article provides the theoretical basis for the clinical applications of cordycepin and discusses the path for future studies focusing on expanding the medicinal use of cordycepin. Taken together, cordycepin and its analogs show great potential as the next new class of anti-inflammatory agents.","Tan, Lu; Song, Xiaominting; Ren, Yali; Wang, Miao; Guo, Chuanjie; Guo, Dale; Gu, Yucheng; Li, Yuzhi; Cao, Zhixing; Deng, Yun",Phytother. res,,414

(1989) to reflect on the complex narrative structures and temporalities of epidemics as they are experienced and storied We begin with an analysis of Rosenberg's use of Albert Camus's The Plague and a discussion of how epidemics have been modeled in literature and in epidemiology concomitantly Then, we argue that Charles Rosenberg's characterization of epidemics as events bounded in time that display narrative and epidemiological purity fails to account for the reinvention of life within health crises Adopting the ecological, archaeological, and anthropological perspectives developed within African studies enriches the range of available plots, roles, and temporal sequences and ultimately transforms our way of depicting epidemics Instead of events oriented toward their own closure, epidemics might be approached as unsettling, seemingly endless periods during which life has to be recomposed","Lachenal, Guillaume Thomas Gaëtan",Bulletin of the History of Medicine,,414

Pre-existing cardiometabolic, renal and respiratory diseases as well as old age are well-established risk factors associated with disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. However, mounting evidence also indicates an increased susceptibility to, and risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 in people with schizophrenia, independent of age and comorbidity. Therefore, elucidating the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms which may increase the risk of poor outcomes in people with schizophrenia is of crucial importance. Here, we provide a narrative on the current understanding of COVID-19 in patients with schizophrenia and propose potential mechanisms which may link schizophrenia with an increased susceptibility to, and greater risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19. Given the existing knowledge gaps, robust clinical and biological studies are required to further our understanding of some of these underlying mechanisms, so that effective prevention and treatment strategies for COVID-19 in patients with schizophrenia can be developed.","Mohan, M.; Perry, B.

346648,Dataset for homologous proteins in Drosophila melanogaster for SARS-CoV-2/human interactome,2020,"Although handwashing is an effective way to prevent infections, there is scarce evidence on predictors of handwashing during a pandemic. This paper aims to identify behavioural and demographic predictors of handwashing. The study surveyed 674 adults in Malaysia in May 2020 regarding whether the time spent on social media predicted handwashing contingent on gender and number of children. More time spent on social media was positively associated with handwashing for males with three or more children. However, for males without children, social media use was negatively associated with handwashing. The association was not significant for males with one or two children. For females, more time spent on social media was significantly linked to more handwashing only for females with one child. Gender, a traditional predictor of handwashing, was a useful predictor only for those who spent more than three hours per day on social media and had at most one child. Number of children was a novel negative predictor for males who did not use social media and who averaged one hour per day on social media, a positive predictor for males who spent lots of time on social media, but not a predictor for females. In sum, social media use predicts handwashing, and is thus a helpful variable for use in targeted health communication during a pandemic - particularly through social media. Further, more conventional predictors like gender and number of children exhibit contingency effects with social media use.","Zhang, Stephen X; Graf-Vlachy, Lorenz; Looi, Kim Hoe; Su, Rui; Li, Jizhen",Epidemiol Infect,,414

The introduction of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) has ignited clinical interest in this new disorder, along with debate over challenges in validating and implementing these new criteria. At the same time, the global COVID-19 pandemic has launched several local and international efforts to provide urgent support and comfort for individuals and communities suffering from grief. Recently, grief experts have called for a collective response to these complicated bereavements and possible increase in PGD due to COVID-19. Here we outline a new European network that aims to unite a community of grief researchers and clinicians to provide accessible, evidence-based support particularly during times of unprecedent crisis. The Bereavement Network Europe (BNE) has been developed with two main aims. Firstly, to develop expert agreed, internationally acceptable guidelines for bereavement care through a three-tiered approach. Secondly, to provide a platform for researchers and clinicians to share knowledge, collaborate, and develop consensus protocols to facilitate the introduction of PGD to diverse stakeholders. This article outlines the current status and aims of the BNE along with the plans for upcoming network initiatives and the three-tiered bereavement care guidelines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Killikelly, C; Smid, G E; Wagner, B; Boelen, P A",Public Health,,414

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to investigate the risk factors for the conversion of common covid-19 to severe in the training set, the prediction model was established and verified externally in the validation set. 60 (14.71%) of 408 patients with common covid-19 became severe in 6-10 days after diagnosis. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that lactate (P = 0.042, OR = 1097.983, 95% CI 1.303, 924,798.262) and CD8+ T cells (P = 0.010, OR = 0.903, 95% CI 0.835, 0.975) were independent risk factors for general type patients to turn to severe type. The area under ROC curve of lactate and CD8+ T cells was 0.754 (0.581, 0.928) and 0.842 (0.713, 0.970), respectively. The actual observation value was highly consistent with the prediction model value in curve fitting. The established prediction model was verified in 78 COVID-19 patients in the verification set, the area under the ROC curve was 0.906 (0.861, 0.981), and the calibration curve was consistent. CD8+ T cells, as an independent risk factor, could predict the transition from common covid-19 to severe.","Liu, Li; Chen, Zhiyong; Du, Yingrong; Gao, Jianpeng; Li, Junyi; Deng, Tiqin; Chen, Chen; Wang, Lin; Yang, Yongrui; Liu, Chunyun",Sci Rep,,414

Stressors originating in the workplace (job insecurity and remote work) and in the family (stressful familial social ties) were examined in a sample of 232 working adults in the southeastern United States. Individuals were more likely to reactivate their dormant ties when their job was insecure, and the magnitude of the reactivations was greater among individuals experiencing stressful social ties with family members than those not experiencing those stressors. We also found that there was a significant interaction between remote work and having a stressful tie within the household in dormant tie reactivation. Although previous theory has focused mostly on the benefits of frequent, active social relationships for coping, our results suggest that reactivating dormant ties might be a coping mechanism as well. Our study also suggests that workplace dormant tie research should broaden its focus beyond exchanged instrumental support to consider emotional support that might be transferred during reactivation.

354502,Evolutionary Multi-Objective Design of SARS-CoV-2 Protease Inhibitor Candidates,2020-05-06,"BACKGROUND: Reducing poverty and improving access to health care are two of the most effective actions to decrease maternal mortality, and conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes act on both. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of one of the world's largest CCT (the Brazilian Bolsa Familia Programme (BFP)) on maternal mortality during a period of 11 years. METHODS: The study had an ecological longitudinal design and used all 2548 Brazilian municipalities with vital statistics of adequate quality during 2004-2014. BFP municipal coverage was classified into four levels, from low to consolidated, and its duration effects were measured using the average municipal coverage of previous years. We used negative binomial multivariable regression models with fixed-effects specifications, adjusted for all relevant demographic, socioeconomic, and healthcare variables. RESULTS: BFP was significantly associated with reductions of maternal mortality proportionally to its levels of coverage and years of implementation, with a rate ratio (RR) reaching 0.88 (95%CI 0.81-0.95), 0.84 (0.75-0.96) and 0.83 (0.71-0.99) for intermediate, high and consolidated BFP coverage over the previous 11 years. The BFP duration effect was stronger among young mothers (RR 0.77; 95%CI 0.67-0.96). BFP was also associated with reductions in the proportion of pregnant women with no prenatal visits (RR 0.73; 95%CI 0.69-0.77), reductions in hospital case-fatality rate for delivery (RR 0.78; 95%CI 0.66-0.94) and increases in the proportion of deliveries in hospital (RR 1.05; 95%CI 1.04-1.07). CONCLUSION: Our findings show that a consolidated and durable CCT coverage could decrease maternal mortality, and these long-term effects are stronger among poor mothers exposed to CCT during their childhood and adolescence, suggesting a CCT inter-generational effect. Sustained CCT coverage could reduce health inequalities and contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal 3.1, and should be preserved during the current global economic crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rasella, Davide; Alves, Flávia Jôse Oliveira; Rebouças, Poliana; de Jesus, Gabriela Santos; Barreto, Maurício L; Campello, Tereza; Paixao, Enny S",BMC Med,,414

In this study, we report clinical and microbiological features of ten COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário (CHCSJ) between January 21 to February 16, 2020. Clinical samples from all patients including nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)/sputum, urine, and feces were collected for serial virus RNA testing by standard qRT-PCR assay. In total, seven were imported cases and three were local cases. The median duration from Macau arrival to admission in imported cases was 3 days. Four patients required oxygen therapy but none of them needed machinal ventilation. No fatal cases were noted. The most common symptoms were fever (80%) and diarrhea (80%). In the ""Severe"" group, there was significantly more elderly patients (p=0.045), higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (p=0.002), and elevated C-Reactive protein levels compared to the ""Mild to Moderate"" group (p<0.001). There were positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA signals in all patients' NPS and stool specimens but negative in all urine specimens. Based on our data on SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in stool and the possibility of a lag in viral detection in NPS specimens, the assessment of both fecal and respiratory specimen is recommended to enhance diagnostic sensitivity, and also to aid discharge decision before the role of viral RNA shedding in stool is clarified.","Lo, Iek Long; Lio, Chon Fu; Cheong, Hou Hon; Lei, Chin Ion; Cheong, Tak Hong; Zhong, Xu; Tian, Yakun; Sin, Nin Ngan",Int J Biol Sci,,414

This lockdown revealed emerging vulnerabilities of education systems in the low-and middle-income countries of the world, with Nigeria being no exception. Given these concerns, this research study assessed parental involvement, learning participation and the commitment to online learning of adolescent learners during the COVID-19 lockdown in Nigeria. Au online survey questionnaire was employed to examine the level of online learning commitment and the contributory roles of each of the factors to online learning commitment of adolescent learners. In total, 1407 adolescents (male = 38.8%;female 61.2%) aged between 12 and 20 years (mean = 15: SD = 4.24) responded to the online survey, which was open for 2 months. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics of frequency distribution and inferential statistics of multiple regression. The findings revealed that the commitment level of adolescent learners to online learning was high. The findings further yielded a coefficient of R= 0.439 and R-2 = 0.192 variance in the prediction of the outcome measure. Parental involvement contributed 32% (beta = 0.322, p &lt; 0.05) and learning participation contributed 23% (beta = 0.234, p &lt; 0.05) towards online learning. The study concludes that parental involvement and learning participation played a significant and positive role in the commitment of adolescent learners towards online learning during the COVID-19 lockdown in Nigeria. The authors suggest that parents be encouraged to synergise with the digitalised revolution, while the need for further in-depth research on the subject is emphasised in the suggestions for future research.","Lawrence, K.

Because public behaviour is key to curbing the pandemic at an early stage, it is important for social psychological researchers to use their knowledge to promote behaviours that help manage the crisis. Here, we identify human values as particularly important in driving both behavioural compliance to government guidelines and promoting prosocial behaviours to alleviate the strains arising from a prolonged pandemic. Existing evidence demonstrates the importance of human values, and the extent to which they are shared by fellow citizens, for tackling the COVID-19 crisis. Individuals who attach higher importance to self-transcendence (e.g., responsibility) and conservation (e.g., security) values are likely to be more compliant with COVID-19 behavioural guidelines and to help others who are struggling with the crisis.

At the same time, if we consider the University context, there is little attention paid during basic nursing education to emergency response, and faculty members report feeling poorly prepared to teach students about this topic. The present study aims to investigate how the Covid-19 pandemic condition influenced the psychological well-being of the Italian nursing students. METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered to Italian nursing students which contains two parts: a demographic section and the assessment to the psychological well-being nursing student with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. RESULTS: Given the emergency health situation from Covid-19, our initial concern was to find a large number of students with difficulties in mentally processing this situation even with problems such as depression, as their future profession is heavily involved in the management of this pandemic. Fortunately our results have denied our initial hypothesis since both the impact management levels of the event, assessed with the IES-R scale, and the depression levels, assessed with the PHQ-9 recorded values ââthat were almost normal. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing students are better able to face the situation since they find themselves in the role of spectators and not in the role of actors in the care of patients with Covid-19. If the training ameliorates psychological well being, therefore, it is necessary to provide and preserve nurses expertise to encourage teaching in nursing degree courses on maxi emergencies to prepare future nurses to face them adequately.","Vitale, Elsa; Moretti, Biagio; Noternicola, Angela; Covelli, Ilaria",Acta Biomed,,414

COVID-19 is caused by the virus SARS- CoV-2, it enters the cells through the ACE2 receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme 2). It is well known that SARS-CoV-2 could develop mild, moderate, and severe respiratory symptoms that could lead to death. The virus receptor is expressed in different organs such as the lungs, kidney, intestine, and brain, among others. In the lung could cause pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The brain can be directly affected by cellular damage due to viral invasion, which can lead to an inflammatory response, by the decrease in the enzymatic activity of ACE2 that regulates neuroprotective, neuro-immunomodulatory and neutralizing functions of oxidative stress. Another severe damage is hypoxemia in patients that do not receive adequate respiratory support. The neurological symptoms that the patient presents, will depend on factors that condition the expression of ACE2 in the brain such as age and sex, as well as the mechanism of neuronal invasion, the immune response and the general state of the patient. Clinical and histopathological studies have described neurological alterations in human patients with COVID-19.

Then three copolymers (PBDT-Se, PBDSe-T and PBDSe-Se) were obtained by manipulating the connected types and number of selenophene on the conjugated main chains with two 2D fused-ring units and two different &#960;-bridges, respectively. In comparison with PBDT-Se and PBDSe-Se, PBDSe-T with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b¢]diselenophene unit and thiophene &#960;-bridge exhibits the deepest HOMO energy level and the strongest crystallinity in neat films. The PBDSe-T:Y6 blend film exhibits the best absorption complementarity, the most distinctive face-on orientation with proper phase separation, the highest carrier mobilities, and the lowest charge recombination among three blend films. Finally, the PBDSe-T:Y6-based device delivers an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.50%, which is higher than that of PBDT-Se:Y6 and PBDSe-Se:Y6. Moreover, a decent open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.89 V with a remarkable small energy loss of 0.44 eV was achieved for PBDSe-T:Y6. The efficiency of 14.50% is the highest value for selenophene-containing copolymer-based binary organic solar cells (OSCs). Our systemic study provides evidence that introduction of 2D-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b¢]diselenophene as the new fused electron-rich unit with synergistic &#960;-bridge into copolymeric donors is a valid strategy for providing high Voc and excellent PCE simultaneously in selenophene-based OSCs.","Wang, Jin-Liang; Liu, Yan-Qiang; Zhi, Hong-Fu; Bai, Hai-Rui; Jiang, Zhao; Wan, Shi-Sheng; Jiang, Mengyun; Mahmood, Asif; Yang, Can; Sun, Shuo; An, Qiaoshi","ChemSusChem (Weinh., Internet)",,414

However, little work has been done in this regard. To bridge the gap, this paper reports a first comprehensive empirical study on developers' live chat, investigating when they interact, what community structures look like, which topics are discussed, and how they interact. We manually analyze 749 dialogs in the first phase, followed by an automated analysis of over 173K dialogs in the second phase. We find that developers tend to converse more often on weekdays, especially on Wednesdays and Thursdays (UTC), that there are three common community structures observed, that developers tend to discuss topics such as API usages and errors, and that six dialog interaction patterns are identified in the live chat communities. Based on the findings, we provide recommendations for individual developers and OSS communities, highlight desired features for platform vendors, and shed light on future research directions. We believe that the findings and insights will enable a better understanding of developers' live chat, pave the way for other researchers, as well as a better utilization and mining of knowledge embedded in the massive chat history.","Shi, Lin; Chen, Xiao; Yang, Ye; Jiang, Hanzhi; Jiang, Ziyou; Niu, Nan; Wang, Qing",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.05823v1.pdf,414

Various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and epilepsy, afflict many people worldwide, with increasing age representing the leading risk factor. Crocin is a natural carotenoid compound which was found to have therapeutic potentials in the management of the neurological disease. In this review, we focused on the restorative capabilities of Crocin as a neuroprotective agent. The general neuroprotective impact and the various conceivable basic components identified with Crocin have been examined. In light of the substantial proof indicating the neuro-pharmacological viability of Crocin to different exploratory standards, it is concluded that Crocin exerts direct antioxidant, antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory activities by multiple signaling pathways. Besides, Crocin was found to elevate dopamine level in the brain during the experimental model of Parkinson's disease. Thus, this compound has been demonstrated to be a promising option for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, with few adverse effects.

Here, we dissected the dynamics of virus replication and the host cell transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection at a systems level by combining time-resolved RNA sequencing with mathematical modeling. We observed an immediate transcriptional activation of inflammatory pathways linked to the anti-viral response followed by increased expression of genes involved in ribosome and mitochondria function, thus hinting at rapid alterations in protein production and cellular energy supply. At later stages, metabolic processes, in particular those depending on cytochrome P450 enzymes, were downregulated. To gain a deeper understanding of the underlying transcriptional dynamics, we developed an ODE model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. Iterative model reduction and refinement revealed that a negative feedback from virus proteins on the expression of anti-viral response genes was essential to explain our experimental dataset. Our study provides insights into SARS-CoV-2 virus-host interaction dynamics and facilitates the identification of druggable host pathways supporting virus replication.","Adam, Lukas; Stanifer, Megan; Springer, Fabian; Mathony, Jan; Ponzio, Chiara Di; Eils, Roland; Boulant, Steeve; Niopek, Dominik; Kallenberger, Stefan M.",,,414

371333,Deducing the N- and O- glycosylation profile of the spike protein of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since 1979, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) have recommended the use of pasteurized human milk from a human milk bank (HMB) to feed low birthweight (LBW) and preterm newborns as the 'first alternative' when mothers are unable to provide their own milk. However, they have not issued any guidelines for the safe establishment and operation of an HMB. This gap contributes to the demand for gathering experiences from HMB networks, especially those from lower-middle income countries. To fill this knowledge gap, this study examines the characteristics of donors, donation, pasteurization, and recipients during the first four years of operation in the first HMB in Vietnam. METHODS: Data about the donors, donation, pasteurization, and recipients were extracted from the web-based electronic monitoring system of the HMB from 1 February 2017 to 31 January 2021. RESULTS: In the first four years of operation there were 433 donors who donated 7642 L of milk (66% from the community) with an increased trend in the amount of donated milk, donation duration, and average amount of milk donated by a donor. Approximately 98% of the donated milk was pasteurized, and 82% passed both pre- and post-pasteurization tests. Although the pass rate tended to increase with time, a few dips occurred. Of 16,235 newborns who received pasteurized donor milk, two thirds were in the postnatal wards. The main reason for the prescription of pasteurized donor milk was insufficient mothers' own milk in the first few days after birth. There was a decreased trend in the amount and duration of using pasteurized donor milk in both postnatal wards and the neonatal unit. CONCLUSIONS: The HMB has operated efficiently in the previous four years, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, to serve vulnerable newborns. Ongoing evidence-based adjustments helped to improve the operation to recruit suitable donors, to increase the access to and quality of raw donor milk, to improve the pasteurization process, and to meet the need of more newborns.","Tran, Hoang Thi; Nguyen, Tuan Thanh; Barnett, Debbie; Weaver, Gillian; Nguyen, Oanh Thi Xuan; Van Ngo, Quang; Le, Huong Thi Thanh; Huynh, Le Thi; Do, Chung Thi; Mathisen, Roger",Nutrients,,414

Virus transmission most likely favors low temperature and low humidity conditions. This systematic review aimed to collect evidence on the impact of temperature and humidity on COVID-19 mortality. This review was registered with PROSPERO (registration no. CRD42020196055). We searched the Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane COVID-19 databases for observational epidemiological studies. Two independent reviewers screened the title/abstracts and full texts of the studies. Two reviewers also performed data extraction and quality assessment. From 5051 identified studies, 11 were included in the review. Although the results were inconsistent, most studies imply that a decrease in temperature and humidity contributes to an increase in mortality. To establish the association with greater certainty, future studies should consider accurate exposure measurements and important covariates, such as government lockdowns and population density, sufficient lag times, and non-linear associations.","Romero Starke, Karla; Mauer, René; Karskens, Ethel; Pretzsch, Anna; Reissig, David; Nienhaus, Albert; Seidler, Anna Lene; Seidler, Andreas",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,414

Methods: this was a cross-sectional study conducted in selected health areas in the Buea municipality. A questionnaire was administered at the onset and two months later to collect data on the participants´ knowledge, attitude and practices towards COVID-19. The data were analyzed in SPSS version 25. Results: a total of 480 and 680 participants were sampled at onset and two months later respectively. Of the 26 indicators of knowledge assessed, 22 (84.61%) showed significant increase (p<0.05) with the most significant changes observed with the symptoms, mode of transmission and prevention of the disease. The overall proportion of people with correct knowledge moved from 9.1% at onset to 41.4% two months after. Only 1.5% of participants had poor knowledge of the pandemic two months after against 14.2% at the onset. There was a significant (p<0.05) positive change in the population perception, attitude and practices toward COVID-19 two months after the onset of the pandemic. Conclusion: the population knowledge, attitude and practices on COVID-19 showed a positive trend two months after the onset of the pandemic. The implementation of government and health stakeholder preventive measures together with the incidence of the pandemic in Cameroon probably had a positive impact on the positive trend observed. There is a need for continuous sensitization to completely fill the knowledge gap of the population on COVID-19.","Mandaah, Forlemu Vanessa; Nicholas, Tendongfor; Esemu, Seraphine Nkie; Vanessa, Amana Bokagne Therese; Destin, Kouam Talla Gilchrist; Atiepoh, Nganyewo Cynthia; Vanessa, Lambou Fopa",Pan Afr Med J,,414

373621,SARS-CoV-2: Brief history and molecular biology ?,2020,"Introduction Older adults compose a segment of the population who are especially vulnerable to loneliness and isolation and have been disproportionately impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic [1],[2],[3],[4] Evidence shows traditional social support programs enhance their health and well-being;the current pandemic provides an opportunity to understand the potential benefits of virtual social support [5],[6] Friendly Calls to Seniors (FCS) is an interprofessional student volunteer program that is part of Columbia University's COVID-19 Student Service Corps (CSSC), founded at the outset of the pandemic Utilizing a script developed by student leaders and faculty advisors from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC), volunteers regularly call older adults with underlying mental health conditions The calls provide social support and opportunities to identify and refer health concerns to care providers, thereby addressing both medical and social needs this group faces, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic Methods FCS is a phone call-based social support program in which student volunteers provide companionship and conduct health risk assessments for interested clients, who are older adults with underlying psychiatric conditions referred by clinical providers in the Washington Heights region of Manhattan Student volunteers are on-boarded, HIPAA-trained, and supervised by two student leaders, as well as two faculty members of CUIMC, a geriatric psychiatrist and an occupational therapist Volunteers use a HIPAA-compliant platform to securely call clients, using a translator if necessary Calls are conducted using a script, which includes a suggested introduction, sample conversational topics, and a risk assessment for health and functioning that incorporates psychiatric and occupational considerations The script also includes an escalation flowchart to refer client issues to the attention of the faculty supervisors to be connected with social workers, medical professionals, or community resources Calls are tracked through secure survey forms and project metrics are tabulated weekly The volunteer team convenes in weekly Zoom meetings to review volunteer-client interactions and pose questions that may have arisen The project has integrated educational workshops from other organizations such as Columbia's Narrative Medicine Program The student and faculty leadership also collaborates with community-based organizations and naturally occurring retirement communities (NORCs) in the Washington Heights region Results At the time of writing, a total of 400 calls have been made by FCS student volunteers to 72 unique clients, ranging in age from 61 to 96 Of these, 38 are English-speaking and 34 are Spanish speaking;49 clients elected to continue receiving calls All clients have existing mental and physical health conditions, including depression, anxiety, neurocognitive disorders, bipolar disorder, and PTSD Medical comorbidities, which were highly prevalent, existing in 45% of clients, included diabetes mellitus and hypertension In total, 48 escalations have been made since the start of the program Table 1 displays a breakdown of the escalation reasons: There have been 41 total volunteers since the program's inception, of whom 18 are currently active The volunteers represent a wide range of health professions and undergraduate programs at Columbia, as seen in Table 2 Qualitative volunteer feedback about FCS was obtained through call log responses and reflection sessions Volunteers cited increased knowledge of community resources and improved skills in relationship-building and addressing geriatric-specific concerns, such as discussing mental health concerns in an age-attuned and culturally sensitive manner Additional skills gained included the ability to properly coordinate with an interpreter and communicate across language barriers;many students had never worked with an interpreter prior to being a part of FCS Conclusions The FCS program exhibits promising qualitative results supporting vulnerable older adults Using a script with a systematic risk assessment, volunteers have performed regular outreach to seniors and referred them to appropriate social services and/or healthcare professionals as needed Clients and the FCS team have mutually benefited from the interprofessional perspectives informing this program, which have led to improved understanding of professional roles, available community resources, and opportunities for comprehensive care Looking ahead, FCS will continue to be relevant as the COVID-19 pandemic draws on and many seniors remain socially isolated The team will develop quantitative outcome metrics to better understand the impact of its work The interprofessional, community-based education model, exemplified by the FCS interprofessional project, will be developed as a generalizable model for ensuring quality of care and best practice Funding none","Nathanson, Mark Rau Sonalee Jiang Enoch Phyllis Simon",The American Journal of Geriatric

However, their success is restricted and there is a need to identify new therapeutic targets. Here, we show that natural killer cell granule protein 7 (NKG7) is a regulator of lymphocyte granule exocytosis and downstream inflammation in a broad range of diseases. NKG7 expressed by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells played key roles in promoting inflammation during visceral leishmaniasis and malaria-two important parasitic diseases. Additionally, NKG7 expressed by natural killer cells was critical for controlling cancer initiation, growth and metastasis. NKG7 function in natural killer and CD8+ T cells was linked with their ability to regulate the translocation of CD107a to the cell surface and kill cellular targets, while NKG7 also had a major impact on CD4+ T cell activation following infection. Thus, we report a novel therapeutic target expressed on a range of immune cells with functions in different immune responses.","Ng, Susanna S; De Labastida Rivera, Fabian; Yan, Juming; Corvino, Dillon; Das, Indrajit; Zhang, Ping; Kuns, Rachel; Chauhan, Shashi Bhushan; Hou, Jiajie; Li, Xian-Yang; Frame, Teija C M; McEnroe, Benjamin A; Moore, Eilish; Na, Jinrui; Engel, Jessica A; Soon, Megan S F; Singh, Bhawana; Kueh, Andrew J; Herold, Marco J; Montes de Oca, Marcela; Singh, Siddharth Sankar; Bunn, Patrick T; Aguilera, Amy Roman; Casey, Mika; Braun, Matthias; Ghazanfari, Nazanin; Wani, Shivangi; Wang, Yulin; Amante, Fiona H; Edwards, Chelsea L; Haque, Ashraful; Dougall, William C; Singh, Om Prakash; Baxter, Alan G; Teng, Michele W L; Loukas, Alex; Daly, Norelle L; Cloonan, Nicole; Degli-Esposti, Mariapia A; Uzonna, Jude; Heath, William R; Bald, Tobias; Tey, Siok-Keen; Nakamura, Kyohei; Hill, Geoffrey R; Kumar, Rajiv; Sundar, Shyam; Smyth, Mark J; Engwerda, Christian R",,,414

379236,A High-Throughput Radioactivity-Based Assay for Screening SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 Complex,2021,"OBJECTIVES: We estimate the point seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the frontline firefighter/paramedic workforce of a South Florida fire department located in the epicentre of a State outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used to estimate the point seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a rapid immunoglobulin (Ig)M-IgG combined point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay among frontline firefighters/paramedics collected over a 2-day period, 16-17 April 2020. Fire department personnel were emailed a survey link assessing COVID-19 symptoms and work exposures the day prior to the scheduled drive-through antibody testing at a designated fire station. Off-duty and on-duty firefighter/paramedic personnel drove through the fire station/training facility in their personal vehicles or on-duty engine/rescue trucks for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. RESULTS: Among the 203 firefighters/paramedics that make up the fire department workforce, 18 firefighters/paramedics (8.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, of which 8 firefighters/paramedics (3.9%) were IgG positive only, 8 (3.9%) were IgM positive only and 2 (0.1%) were IgG/IgM positive. The positive predictive value (PPV) of the serological test is estimated to be 33.2% and the negative predictive value is 99.3%. The average number of COVID-19 case contacts (ie, within 6 feet of an infected person (laboratory-confirmed or probable COVID-19 patient) for &#8805;15 min) experienced by firefighters/paramedics was higher for those with positive serology compared with those with negative (13.3 cases vs 7.31 cases; p=0.022). None of the antibody positive firefighters/paramedics reported receipt of the annual influenza vaccine compared with firefighters/paramedics who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (0.0% vs 21.0%; p=0.027). CONCLUSION: Rapid SARS-CoV-2 IgM-IgG antibody testing documented early-stage and late-stage infection in a firefighter workforce providing insight to a broader medical surveillance project on return to work for firefighters/paramedics. Given the relatively low PPV of the serological test used in this study back in April 2020, caution should be used in interpreting test results.","Caban-Martinez, Alberto J; Schaefer-Solle, Natasha; Santiago, Katerina; Louzado-Feliciano, Paola; Brotons, Angel; Gonzalez, Marco; Issenberg, S Barry; Kobetz, Erin",Occup. environ. med,,414

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Changsha, China were included. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment, and outcome were retrieved. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore potential factors. RESULTS: Overall, 147 patients with COVID-19 were included. The median duration of viral shedding (the number of days from symptoms onset until the successive negative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA) was 17 days (interquartile range [IQR], 12-21). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis indicated that the highest temperature at admission (odds ratio [OR], 5.200; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.190-22.726; p = 0.028), time from symptom onset to admission (OR, 1.740; 95% CI: 1.296-2.337; p < 0.001) and hospital length of stay (OR, 1.604; 95% CI: 1.262-2.040; p < 0.001) were risk factors for prolonged duration of viral shedding. CONCLUSIONS: This study, with a relatively large sample size, focused on the duration of viral shedding and related factors in patients with COVID-19, outside of Wuhan, China.

The causative coronavirus was later named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). As of 10 August 2020, more than 19,718,030 confirmed cases and 728,013 deaths have been reported. COVID-19 is spread via respiratory droplets which are inhaled into the lungs. AREAS COVERED: In this article, we summarized the knowledge about the causative pathogen of COVID-19 and various diagnostic methods in this pandemic for better understanding of the limitations and the nuances of virus testing for COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION: In this pandemic, rapid and accurate identification of COVID-19 patients are critical to break the chain of infection in the community. RT-PCR provides a rapid and reliable identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the future, molecular diagnostics will still be the gold standard and next-generation sequencing can help us to understand more on the pathogenesis and detect novel mutations.

390852,Establishing a mass spectrometry-based system for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in large clinical sample cohorts,2020,"Public health authorities have been paramount in guaranteeing that adequate fresh air ventilation is promoted in classrooms to avoid SARS-CoV-2 transmission in educational environments. In this work it was aimed to assess ventilation conditions (carbon dioxide, CO2) and suspended particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10 and UFP) levels in 19 classrooms - including preschool, primary and secondary education - located in the metropolitan area of Ciudad Real, Central-Southern Spain, during the school's reopening (from September 30th until October 27th, 2020) after about 7 months of lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic. The classrooms that presented the worst indoor environmental conditions, according to the highest peak of concentration obtained, were particularly explored to identify the possible influencing factors and respective opportunities for improvement. Briefly, findings suggested that although ventilation promoted through opening windows and doors according to official recommendations is guaranteeing adequate ventilation conditions in most of the studied classrooms, thus minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission, a total of 5 (26%) surveyed classrooms were found to exceed the recommended CO2 concentration limit value (700 ppm). In general, preschool rooms were the educational environments that registered better ventilation conditions, while secondary classrooms exhibited the highest peak and average CO2 concentrations. In turn, for PM2.5, PM10 and UFP, the concentrations assessed in preschools were, on average about 2-fold greater than the levels obtained in both primary and secondary classrooms. In fact, the indoor PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations substantially exceeded the recommended limits of 8hr-exposure, established by WHO, in 63% and 32% of the surveyed classrooms, respectively. Overall, it is expected that the findings presented in this study will assist the establishment of evidence-based measures (namely based on ensuring proper ventilation rates and air filtration) to mitigate preventable environmental harm in public school buildings, mainly at local and national levels.","Villanueva, Florentina; Notario, Alberto; Cabañas, Beatriz; Martín, Pilar; Salgado, Sagrario; Gabriel, Marta Fonseca",Environ Res,,414

394930,Favipiravir antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in a hamster model,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Lockdown measures in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can have serious mental health effects on the population, especially in vulnerable groups, such as those living in poor socio-economic conditions, those who are homeless, migrant workers and asylum seekers/refugees. In addition, these vulnerable groups frequently have greater difficulty accessing health services and in treatment adherence. The aim of this study is to estimate the impact of the COVID-19-related lockdown on service utilisation and follow-up adherence in an Italian mental health outpatient service for migrants and individuals in socio-economic difficulties. STUDY DESIGN: The design of this study is a retrospective cross-sectional study. METHODS: All patients who visited the mental health outpatient service in the months of February and March in the years 2017-2020 were included in the study. To compare service utilisation before and after the lockdown, the number of patients who visited the mental health outpatient service for psychiatric interview were recorded. Follow-up adherence was calculated as the percentage of patients who visited in February and subsequently attended a follow-up visit in March of the same year. RESULTS: The number of patients who visited the outpatient service between February 2017 and February 2020 was continuously increasing. In March 2020, fewer patients visited the service for psychiatric interview, in line with the introduction of lockdown measures. In addition, the number of the patients who visited in February 2020 and returned for their follow-up visits in March 2020 declined from approximately 30% over the same months in 2017-2019 to 17.53% in March 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown-related reduction in numbers of patients accessing the mental health service makes it difficult to help vulnerable populations during a period of time in which their mental health needs are expected to increase. Moreover, the reduction seen in follow-up compliance increases the risk of treatment discontinuation and possible relapse. Proactive alternative strategies need to be developed to reach these vulnerable populations.","Aragona, M; Barbato, A; Cavani, A; Costanzo, G; Mirisola, C",Public Health,,414

A multicenter observational study was conducted to identify the pattern of SARS-CoV-2 infection, transmission, and treatment in patients admitted to seven low to middle-income district hospitals in the Province of Punjab, Pakistan from March to June 2020. A total of 102 patients were recruited. 57 patients tested positive and 45 developed moderate-severe COVID-19 disease. About 67% of the patients in March-April and 93% in May-June have contracted the disease from the local transmission. The mean number of symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients was significantly higher than suspected patients (6.46 vs 5.04, p=0.003). The number of deaths was low (n=8) with 86% recovery rate. Mild COVID patients received acetaminophen (n=102), azithromycin (n=8), and hydroxychloroquine (n=4) in addition to standard medical care. The treatment provided to moderate-severe cases included acetaminophen (45/45), azithromycin (45/45), Ivermectin (14/45) and corticosteroids (13/45). The mean number of antimicrobials was significantly higher in moderate-severe patients than mild cases (1.80 vs 1.12, p=0.001). Low number of deaths with a high recovery rate was reported. Diabetes was the most common comorbid condition followed by hypertension. Many antimicrobials were prescribed in both mild and moderate-severe cases that require careful review.","Kamran, S.

395798,Genomic characterization and phylogenetic evolution of the SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Rationale: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has provoked an unprecedented global pandemic. Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) rates in COVID-19 have been reported to be from 2.3% to 33%. The wide range in reported intubation rates is attributed in part to diverging institutional practices for the care of patients presenting with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The role of high flow nasal therapy (HFNT) in the treatment of COVID-19 has been controversial and underreported. Objectives: To report a retrospective analysis comparing the outcomes of patients treated with HFNT and IMV for hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. Methods: This was an analysis of consecutive patients admitted to Temple University Hospital between March 10, 2020, and May 17, 2020, for moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure from COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients were divided into three groups: IMV group-not placed on HFNT prior to intubation. HFNT group-received only HFNT. HFNT to intubation group-received HFNT prior to intubation. Comparisons were made between demographics, baseline laboratory values, and outcomes. Results: 1396 patients admitted to Temple University Hospital between March 10, 2020, and May 17, 2020 with suspected COVID-19 infection were retrospectively screened for this study. 837 patients tested positive for COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR or deemed positive based on clinical features. There were no statistically significant differences in terms of demographics between all three groups. However, the intubation and HFNT to intubation groups had a higher incidence of malignancy compared to the HFNT only group. There was a higher incidence of smoking in the intubation group (59.2%) and HFNT to intubation group (53.7%) compared to HFNT only group (29.2%). Laboratory data were similar between all three groups besides admission BUN/creatinine. In terms of therapies, high-dose steroids were administered more frequently to patients in the HFNT (84.3%) and HFNT to intubation (90.2%) groups compared to the intubated group (56.5%). Overall, 49 (28.1%) were intubated, 84 (48.2%) were treated with HFNT only, and 41 (23.5%) progressed from HFNT to intubation. The mortality was 36.7% in the intubation group, 6% in the HFNT only group, and 43.9% in the HFNT to intubation group. Overall mortality was 25.7%. Conclusion: Our institutional decision to utilize HFNT as the primary treatment for moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure led to a low intubation rate thus reducing overall morbidity and mortality. In the appropriate clinical context HFNT should be the considered the oxygen modality of choice in moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia.","Chowdhury, J.

Little is known about its exact impact on medical care workers and related factors in China. This study aims to identify the psychological impact of COVID-19 on medical care workers in China. METHODS: From February 23 to March 5, 2020, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 863 medical care workers from seven provinces in China using standard questionnaires measuring adverse psychological outcomes including Impact of Event Scale-6 (IES-6), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale(DASS)and related psychosocial factors like perceived threat, social support and coping strategies. Exploratory Factor analysis was performed to identify the dimensions of perceived threat by study participants. Multivariate regression was used to examine the determinants of adverse psychological outcomes. RESULTS: Posttraumatic stress (PTS) were prevalent in this sample of health care professionals, and 40.2% indicated positive screens for significant posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. The proportion of having mild to extremely severe symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were 13.6, 13.9 and 8.6%, respectively. Perceived threat and passive coping strategies were positively correlated to PTS and DASS scores, while perceived social support and active coping strategies were negatively correlated to DASS scores. Nurses were more likely to be anxious than others among medical care workers during the COVID-19 epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse psychological symptoms were prevalent among medical care workers in China during the COVID-19 epidemic. Screening for adverse psychological outcomes and developing corresponding preventive measures would be beneficial in decreasing negative psychological outcomes.","Si, Ming-Yu; Su, Xiao-You; Jiang, Yu; Wang, Wen-Jun; Gu, Xiao-Fen; Ma, Li; Li, Jing; Zhang, Shao-Kai; Ren, Ze-Fang; Ren, Ran; Liu, Yuan-Li; Qiao, You-Lin",Infect Dis Poverty,,414

Few studies have investigated the quarantine experiences of close contacts of COVID-19 patients. The objective of this study was to best capture participants' quarantine experiences during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: A descriptive, qualitative design was used. All interviews were recorded and coded using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Fifteen participants took part in this study. The following five themes emerged: (1) experience in the early stage of quarantine; (2) experience in the middle stage of quarantine; (3) experience in the late stage of quarantine; (4) self-coping persisted throughout the quarantine period; and (5) external support was evident throughout the quarantine period. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the need to assess the psychological state of close contacts in the early stage of quarantine and to provide psychological support for them, especially for the older and the less educated. Although close contacts had physical symptoms and psychological issues, they adopted positive coping strategies, which indicated that they were vulnerable but strong. Furthermore, external support from the Chinese government helped them cope with the quarantine effectively. Learning from the quarantine experience is expected to help the Chinese government and institutions from other parts of the world to better care for close contacts.","Chen, Dandan; Song, Feng; Tang, Leiwen; Zhang, Hui; Shao, Jing; Qiu, Ruolin; Wang, Xiyi; Ye, Zhihong",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,,414

METHODS: In a retrospective multicenter study, we retrieved individual data from in-patients treated March 1 to April 15, 2020 from COVID-19 registries of three hospitals in Saxony, Germany. We also performed a systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA recommendations using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library databases and bibliographies of identified papers (last search on April 11, 2020) and pooled data with those deriving from our multicenter study. Of 3762 records identified, 11 eligible observational studies of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in quantitative data synthesis. Risk ratios (RR) of severe COVID-19 according to history of CVD were pooled using DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q and I2-statistics. Severity of COVID-19 according to definitions applied in included studies was the main outcome. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for clusters of studies with equal definitions of severity. RESULTS: Pooled analysis included data from 1906 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (43.9% females, median age ranging from 39 to 76 years). Patients with previous CVD had higher risk of severe COVID-19 than those without [RR 2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52-2.81; p < 0.0001]. This association was also observed in clusters of studies that defined severe manifestation of the disease by clinical parameters (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.22-1.71; p < 0.0001), necessity of intensive care (RR 2.79, 95% CI 1.83-4.24; p < 0.0001) and in-hospital death (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.75-2.7; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: A history of CVD might constitute an important risk factor of unfavorable clinical course of COVID-19 suggesting a need of tailored infection prevention and clinical management strategies for this population at risk.","Siepmann, Timo; Sedghi, Annahita; Barlinn, Jessica; de With, Katja; Mirow, Lutz; Wolz, Martin; Gruenewald, Thomas; Helbig, Sina; Schroettner, Percy; Winzer, Simon; von Bonin, Simone; Moustafa, Haidar; Pallesen, Lars-Peder; Rosengarten, Bernhard; Schubert, Joerg; Gueldner, Andreas; Spieth, Peter; Koch, Thea; Bornstein, Stefan; Reichmann, Heinz; Puetz, Volker; Barlinn, Kristian",J. neurol,,414

Coronavirus has now spread to all of the continents. We aimed to consider clinical characteristics, laboratory data of COVID-19 that provided more information for the research of this novel virus. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study on the clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of a series of the 100 confirmed patients with COVID-19. These patients were admitted to the hospitals affiliated to Babol University of Medical Sciences (Ayatollah Rohani, Shahid Beheshti and Yahyanejad hospitals) form 25 February 2020 to 12 March 2020. RESULTS: Nineteen patients died during hospitalization and 81 were discharged. Non-survivor patients had a significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP) (MD: 46.37, 95% CI: 20.84, 71.90; P= 0.001), white blood cells (WBCs) (MD: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.53, 4.67; P< 0.001) and lower lymphocyte (MD: -8.75, 95% CI: -12.62, -4.87; P< 0.001) compared to survivor patients Data analysis showed that comorbid conditions (aRR: 2.99, 95%CI: 1.09, 8.21, P= 0.034), higher CRP levels (aRR: 1.02, 95%CI: 1.01, 1.03, P= 0.044), and lower lymphocyte (aRR: 0.82, 95%CI: 0.73, 0.93, P= 0.003) were associated with increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, most non-survivors are elderly with comorbidities. Lymphopenia and increased levels of WBCs along with elevated CRP were associated with increased risk of death.

There is concern however, that this new paradigm may lead to over-saturation or burnout. METHODS: A 12-question survey investigating resident experiences with educational videoconferences was distributed to University of Washington plastic surgery residents. A modified Maslach Burnout Inventory was used to assess resident burnout from virtual conferences. Conference attendance and reasons for missing conferences were compared using paired two-tailed t-tests. RESULTS: A total of 24 residents were given the survey with 100% response rate. There was a significant decrease in the total number of weekly attended videoconferences (p<0.01) and in the number of attended educational videoconferences (p<0.01) over time. Reasons for absences included clinical duties (92% of respondents) followed by symptoms of burnout, including forgetfulness (67%) and feeling fatigued by videoconferencing lectures (54%), and to a lesser extent the belief that the lecture was not educational (25%). 79% of residents reported at least occasionally feeling emotionally drained from videoconferencing and 88% reported at least occasionally feeling burned out due to the number of videoconferencing activities. Despite declining attendance and burnout, 96% believe that videoconferences should continue after the end of quarantine but in a limited quantity. CONCLUSION: Videoconferences have become a valued means of resident education. The data suggests however that attendance has waned, largely due to what can be perceived as burnout. Residents remain interested in continuing educational videoconferences, although prioritizing quality over quantity will remain essential to prevent emotional fatigue and burnout.","Yu, Jenny L; Cho, Daniel Y; DeSanti, Rebecca L; Kneib, Cameron J; Friedrich, Jeffrey B; Colohan, Shannon M",J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg,,414

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the association of pre-existing comorbidities with COVID-19 mortality. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, SCOPUS, OVID, and Cochrane Library databases, and medrxiv.org from December 1st, 2019, to July 9th, 2020. The outcome of interest was the risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients with and without pre-existing comorbidities. We analyzed 11 comorbidities: cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and HIV/AIDS. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. All analyses were performed using random-effects models and heterogeneity was quantified. RESULTS: Eleven pre-existing comorbidities from 25 studies were included in the meta-analysis (n = 65, 484 patients with COVID-19; mean age; 61 years; 57% male). Overall, the between-study heterogeneity was medium, and studies had low publication bias and high quality. Cardiovascular disease (risk ratio (RR) 2.25, 95% CI = 1.60-3.17, number of studies (n) = 14), hypertension (1.82 [1.43 to 2.32], n = 13), diabetes (1.48 [1.02 to 2.15], n = 16), congestive heart failure (2.03 [1.28 to 3.21], n = 3), chronic kidney disease (3.25 [1.13 to 9.28)], n = 9) and cancer (1.47 [1.01 to 2.14), n = 10) were associated with a significantly greater risk of mortality from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease and cancer have a greater risk of mortality compared to patients with COVID-19 without these comorbidities. Tailored infection prevention and treatment strategies targeting this high-risk population might improve survival.","Ssentongo, Paddy; Ssentongo, Anna E; Heilbrunn, Emily S; Ba, Djibril M; Chinchilli, Vernon M",PLoS One,,414
405572,Full genome viral sequences inform patterns of SARS-CoV-2 spread into and within Israel,2020,"INTRODUCTION: We aim to identify any changes in outcome for patients undergoing nonelective surgery at the start of the UK pandemic in our district general hospital. This was a single-centre retrospective cohort review of a UK district general hospital serving a population of over 250,000 people. METHODS: Participants were all patients undergoing a surgical procedure in the acute theatre list between 23 March to 11 May in both 2019 and 2020. Primary outcome was 90-day postoperative mortality. Secondary outcomes include time to surgical intervention and length of inpatient stay. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients (2020) versus 141 (2019) patients were included. Although overall 90-day postoperative mortality was higher in 2020 (9.8%) compared with 2019 (5.7%), this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.196). In 2020, eight patients tested positive for COVID-19 either as an inpatient or within 2 weeks of discharge, of whom five patients died. Time to surgical intervention was significantly faster for NCEPOD (National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death) code 3 patients in 2020 than in 2019 (p=0.027). There were no significant differences in mean length of inpatient stay. CONCLUSIONS: We found that patients were appropriately prioritised using NCEPOD classification, with no statistically significant differences in 90-day postoperative mortality and length of inpatient stay compared with the 2019 period. A study on a larger scale would further elucidate the profile and outcomes of patients requiring acute surgery to generate statistical significance.","Luo, W; Limb, R; Aslam, A; Kattimani, R; Karthikappallil, D; Paramasivan, A; Waseem, M",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,,414
405573,Full genome viral sequences inform patterns of SARS-CoV-2 spread into and within Israel,2020,"BACKGROUND: Border closure is one of the policy changes implemented to mitigate against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We evaluated the effect of border closure on the incidence rate of COVID-19 across nine African countries. METHODS: An interrupted time series analysis was used to assess COVID-19 incidence rates in Egypt, Tunisia, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa (SA). Data were collected between 14 February and 19 July 2020 from online data repositories. The linear trend and magnitude of change were evaluated using the itsa function with ordinary least-squares regression in Stata with a 7-d deferred interruption point, which allows a period of diffusion post-border closure. RESULTS: Overall, the countries recorded an increase in the incidence rate of COVID-19 after border closure. However, when compared with matched control groups, SA, Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt and Kenya showed a higher incidence rate trend. In contrast, Ethiopia, DRC and Tunisia showed a lower trend compared with their controls. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of border closures within African countries had minimal effect on the incidence of COVID-19. The inclusion of other control measures such as enhanced testing capacity and improved surveillance activities will reveal the effectiveness of border closure measures.","Emeto, Theophilus I; Alele, Faith O; Ilesanmi, Olayinka S",Trans.

406267,Concentration of infectious SARS-CoV-2 by polyethylene glycol precipitation,2020,"Protective facial masks reduce the spread of COVID-19 infection and save lives. Yet a substantial number of people have been resistant to wearing them. Considerable effort has been invested in convincing people to put on a mask, if not for their own sake than for those more vulnerable. Social and cognitive psychologists know that use and liking go both ways: people use what they like, and they like what they use. Here we asked whether positive attitudes towards facial masks were higher in those who had been wearing them longer. We asked participants in a diverse sample (N=498 from 5 countries and over 30 US states) to rate how attractive and emotionally arousing masks and other objects associated with COVID-19 were in comparison to neutral objects, as well as reporting on their mask-wearing habits. To confirm reliability of findings, the experiment was repeated in a subset of participants 8-10 weeks later. The findings show that regular use of protective masks was linked to their positive appraisal, with a higher frequency and a longer history of wearing a mask predicting increased mask attractiveness. These results extended to other COVID related objects relative to controls. They also provide critical ecological validity for the idea that emotional appraisal of everyday objects is associated with our experience of using them. Practically, they imply that societal measures to encourage mask wearing may have contributed to positive emotional appraisals in those who put them on, whether due to personal choice or societal pressure.","Dudarev, Veronica; Manaligod, Maria G M; Enns, James; Todd, Rebecca",Q J Exp Psychol (Hove),,414

We aimed to examine population-level changes in the need for and use of contraception by women during the COVID-19 pandemic, determine if these changes differed by sociodemographic characteristics, and compare observed changes during the COVID-19 pandemic with trends in the 2 preceding years. METHODS: In this study, we used four rounds of Performance Monitoring for Action (PMA) population-based survey data collected in four geographies: two at the country level (Burkina Faso and Kenya) and two at the subnational level (Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Lagos, Nigeria). These geographies were selected for this study as they completed surveys immediately before the onset of COVID-19 and implemented a follow-up specific to COVID-19. The first round comprised the baseline PMA panel survey implemented between November, 2019, and February, 2020 (referred to as baseline). The second round comprised telephone-based follow-up surveys between May 28 and July 20, 2020 (referred to as COVID-19 follow-up). The third and fourth rounds comprised two previous cross-sectional survey rounds implemented in the same geographies between 2017 and 2019. FINDINGS: Our analyses were restricted to 7245 women in union (married or living with a partner, as if married) who were interviewed at baseline and COVID-19 follow-up. The proportion of women in need of contraception significantly increased in Lagos only, by 5·81 percentage points (from 74·5% to 80·3%). Contraceptive use among women in need increased significantly in the two rural geographies, with a 17·37 percentage point increase in rural Burkina Faso (30·7% to 48·1%) and a 7·35 percentage point increase in rural Kenya (71·6% to 78·9%). These overall trends mask several distinct patterns by sociodemographic group. Specifically, there was an increase in the need for contraception among nulliparous women across all geographies investigated. INTERPRETATION: Our findings do not support the anticipated deleterious effect of COVID-19 on access to and use of contraceptive services by women in the earliest stages of the pandemic. Although these results are largely encouraging, we warn that these trends might not be sustainable throughout prolonged economic hardship and service disruptions.

409856,Advanced Analysis of Biosensor Data for SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 Interactions,2020,"Background The role and performance of chest CT in the diagnosis of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains under active investigation. Purpose To evaluate the French national experience using Chest CT for COVID-19, results of chest CT and RT-PCR were compared together and with the final discharge diagnosis used as reference standard. Materials and Methods A structured CT scan survey (NCT04339686) was sent to 26 hospital radiology departments in France between March 2 and April 24 2020. These dates correspond to the peak of the national COVID-19 epidemic. Radiology departments were selected to reflect the estimated geographical prevalence heterogeneities of the epidemic. All symptomatic patients suspected of having a COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent within 48 hours both initial chest CT and at least one RT-PCR testing were included. The final discharge diagnosis, based on multiparametric items, was recorded. Data for each center were prospectively collected and gathered each week. Test efficacy was determined by using Mann-Whitney Test, Student's t-test, Chi-square test and Pearson's correlation. A p value <.05 determined statistical significance. Results Twenty-six of 26 hospital radiology departments responded to the survey with 7500 patients entered; 2652 did not have RT-PCR results or had unknown or excess delay between RT-PCR and CT. After exclusions, 4824 patients (mean age 64, ± 19 yrs, 2669 males) were included. Using final diagnosis as the reference, 2564 of the 4824 patients were positive for COVID-19 (53%). Sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV of chest CT for diagnosing COVID-19 were 2319/2564 (90%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 89, 91), 2056/2260 (91%, 95%CI: 91, 92%), 2056/2300 (89%, 95%CI; 87, 90%) and 2319/2524 (92%, 95%CI 91, 93%) respectively. There was no significant difference for chest CT efficacy among the 26 geographically separate sites, each with varying amounts of disease prevalence. Conclusion Use of chest CT for the initial diagnosis and triage of suspected COVID-19 patients was successful.","Herpe, Guillaume; Lederlin, Mathieu; Naudin, Mathieu; Ohana, Mickaël; Chaumoitre, Kathia; Gregory, Jules; Vilgrain, Valérie; Freitag, Cornelia Anna; De Margerie-Mellon, Constance; Flory, Violaine; Ludwig, Marie; Mondot, Lydiane; Fitton, Isabelle; Jacquier, Alexis; Raymond, Robert; Ardilouze, Paul; Petit, Isabelle; Gervaise, Alban; Bayle, Olivier; Crombe, Arielle; Mekuko Sokeng, Magloire; Thomas, Clément; Henry, Geraldine; Bliah, Virginie; Le Tat, Thomas; Guillot, Marc-Samir; Gendrin, Paul; Garetier, Marc; Bertolle, Estelle; Montagne, Catherine; Langlet, Benjamin; Kalaaji, Abdulrazak; Kayayan, Hampar; Desmots, Florian; Dhaene, Benjamin; Saulnier, Pierre-Jean; Guillevin, Remy; Bartoli, Jean-Michel; Beregi, Jean-Paul; Tasu, Jean Pierre",Radiology,,414

412757,Assessing the potential of unmanned aerial vehicle spraying of aqueous ozone as an outdoor disinfectant for SARS-CoV-2,2021,"BACKGROUND: The concern with environmental security to avoid contamination of individuals was intensified with the crisis established by SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the necessity to create systems and devices capable of clearing the air in an environment of micro-organisms more efficiently. The development of systems that allow the removal of micro-droplets mainly originating from breathing or talking from the air was the motivation of this study. AIM: This article describes a portable and easy-to-operate system that helps to eliminate the droplets or aerosols present in the environment by circulating air through an ultraviolet-C (UV-C) reactor. METHODS: An air circulation device was developed, and a proof-of-principle study was performed using the device against bacteria in simulated and natural environments. The microbiological analysis was carried out by the simple sedimentation technique. In order to compare the experimental results and the expected results for other micro-organisms, the reduction rate values for bacteria and viruses were calculated and compared with the experimental results based on technical parameters (clean air delivery rate (CADR) and air changes per hour (ACH)). FINDINGS: Results showed that the micro-organisms were eliminated with high efficiency by the air circulation decontamination device, with reductions of 99.9% in the proof-of-principle study, and 84-97% in the hospital environments study, contributing to reducing contamination of individuals in environments considered to present risk. CONCLUSION: This study resulted in a low-cost and relatively simple device, which was shown to be effective and safe, and could be replicated, especially in low-income countries, respecting the standards for air disinfection using UV-C technologies.","Corrêa, T Q; Blanco, K C; Vollet-Filho, J D; Morais, V S; Trevelin, W R; Pratavieira, S; Bagnato, V S",J Hosp Infect,,414

METHODS: In an open randomized controlled trial, 47 employed patients were allocated to US-guided carpal tunnel release (USCTR) and 42 to an open carpal tunnel release (OCTR) procedure. The main outcome was symptom severity measured by the Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ-S). Secondary outcomes were hand functionality (BCTQ-F), nerve conduction, two-point discrimination, handgrip and pinch strength, pain (visual analog scale), work leave and complications. For BCTQ-S and BCTQ-F, minimal clinically important differences (MCID) were also considered. Follow-up duration was 12 months. RESULTS: Mixed model analyses detected no significant differences between the two treatment arms in BCTQ-S (P = .098) while BCTQ-F scores were significantly better in the USCTR group (P = .007). This benefit was, however, not supported by the MCID data. Remaining variables were similar in the two groups except pain which was lower in USCTR at 3 months follow-up. All variables but two-point discrimination showed significant improvement after 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal similar symptom relief benefits following OCTR or USCTR in these patients. The patients in our USCTR group, however, reported better hand functional status and less pain.","de la Fuente, Javier; Aramendi, Jose F; Ibañez, Jose M; Blasi, Marc; Vazquez, Alberto; Aurrekoetxea, Juan J; Dávila, Fernando",J. clin. ultrasound,,414

To monitor changes in the number of patient encounters for acute UAI and the number of referrals for the workup of HNC. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT-04356560 (Clinicaltrials.gov). METHODS: Prospective enrolled case series of all patients with suspected acute UAI (n = 88) and of patients undergoing surgery for HNC (n = 96), respectively, from March 23rd to May 5th, 2020, at a public tertiary referral otorhinolaryngology clinic in Denmark. SARS-CoV-2 was diagnosed with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabbing. Patients with suspected acute UAI had symptoms and definitive diagnoses registered in a database. Trends in the number of referrals and patient encounters were retrieved from an electronic patient journal system and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients with acute UAI were enrolled including 55 men and 34 women, median age of 31 years (range: 10 months to 82 years). One patient (1.1%) tested positive. Among 96 patients operated for HNC, zero tested positive. The number of referrals for HNC workup, and patient encounters for peritonsillar abscesses, decreased markedly in the first 3 weeks. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 during the first 6 weeks of the first wave was minimal among patients with acute UAI and zero among patients operated for HNC. The decrease in referrals for the workup of HNC may increase time to treatment initiation and patient morbidity.","Andersen, Peter Anders; Rasmussen, Kasper Møller Boje; Channir, Hani Ibrahim; von Buchwald, Christian; Cayé-Thomasen, Per; Klokker, Mads; Knudsen, Jenny Dahl; Kirkby, Nikolai Søren; Aanaes, Kasper; Jensen, Ramon Gordon",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,414

In mid-May 2020, local public health officials responded to an outbreak of COVID-19 among staff and residents associated with a multi-residential group home that provides care for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Samples were collected at 16 of the homes. In four of the homes all the residents tested positive, and in the remaining 12 houses where samples were collected, all residents tested negative. Of the 152 individuals tested, 15/58 (25.9%) residents and 27/94 (28.7%) staff were positive for SARS-CoV-2, including eight hospitalizations and four deaths. Phylogenetic analysis of genomes from this outbreak in the context of genomes from Northern Arizona shows that very few mutations separate the samples from this outbreak.

418550,Introduction of Two Prolines and Removal of the Polybasic Cleavage Site Lead to Higher Efficacy of a Recombinant Spike-Based SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine in the Mouse Model,2021,"The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions of people worldwide. Recent evidence raised the question about the possibility that cats may be a domestic host for SARS-CoV-2 with unknown implications in disease dissemination. Based on the fact that the domestic cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, are abundant ectoparasites infesting humans, companion animals and wildlife and that coronavirus-like agents have been identified in the ectoparasite tick vector, Ixodes uriae of seabirds, herein we considered the presence of coronaviruses in general and SARS-CoV-2 in particular in C. felis. We identified coronavirus-derived and cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme RNA/proteins in C. felis. Although current evidence suggests that pets are probably dead-end-hosts with small risk of transmission to humans, our results suggested that cat flea may act as biological and/or mechanical vectors of SARS-CoV. Although preliminary, these results indicate a possibility of ectoparasites acting as reservoirs and vectors of SARS-CoV and related beta-coronavirus although with little disease risk due to systemic transmission route, low viremia, virus attenuation or other unknown factors. These results support the need to further study the role of animal SARS-CoV-2 hosts and their ectoparasite vectors in COVID-19 disease spread.","Villar, Margarita; Fernández de Mera, Isabel G; Artigas-Jerónimo, Sara; Contreras, Marinela; Gortázar, Christian; de la Fuente, José",Parasit Vectors,,414

420496,Functional variants in human ACE2 can decrease its protein stability and may influence the binding with SARS-CoV-2,2021,"Objective. Determine the targets and methods of psychological and pedagogical work that aimed increasing the specific normativity of students' behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, on compliance with the mask regime. Background. Due to the situation with COVID-19 pandemic many countries all over the world, including in Russia, introduced the number of tough measures which restricted the behavior and interaction of people. The study focuses on such acute issues as the attitudes of different social groups toward both the disease itself and the measures to combat it, clarification of the reasons and motivations for individuals' compliance/non-compliance with normative behavior during the pandemic. The coronavirus pandemic actualizes the problems of providing practical psychological assistance to people, including young people, who experience stress and who have difficulties with coping with this situation. Study design. The study was conducted during the increasing spread of the disease and the introduction of an isolation regime. The data obtained was analyzed with reference to the time of the research participants' questionnaire completion: the first group of students filled the Google forms from 9th to 23rd November 2020 (stage 1);the second group - from 24th November to 8th December 2020 (stage 2). The research analyzed students' social representations of the pandemic and measures to combat it;peculiarities of attitudes toward various aspects of COVID-19 and toward the normative behavior of young people during the pandemic;subjective experience of danger of the disease and the dominant coping strategies associated with them. Participants. 565 undergraduate students from various faculties of the Moscow State University of Psychology and Education (MGPPU): 504 females, 61males. Measurements. Anonymous survey included closed questions;method of prototypical analysis of social representations (P. Verges);Self-perceived flexible coping with stress (SFCS);The Fear of COVID- 19 Scale;SPSS Statistics 20 package (contingency tables with the calculation of the Pearson χ2 test, Spearman's correlation coefficient, Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests). Results. Students showed a diverse and often controversial views on COVID-19 and ways prevent its spread. At the core of social representations of the pandemic and protective masks, the most popular are those that reflect the personal restrictions imposed by the pandemic, the inconvenience and displeasure resulted from the compliance with these restrictions. To a smaller extent, there is a fear of getting sick. There are practically no social representations associated with concern over other people, that express a pro-social position. In relation to the mechanisms of compliance with restrictive measures, the opinions of students are heterogeneous: some support the introduction of strict restrictions and consider it rational to have strict external control, while others believe that the fulfillment of sanitary and epidemiological requirements should be an independent decision of a person. The study found the predominant choice of situational and multiple coping strategies by students in response to the emergence of the pandemic situation and the relationship between these types of coping with low level of subjective fear. Nevertheless, with the deterioration of the pandemic situation, students' assessments of the means of informing about COVID-19 and strategies to combat it changed: at the first stage of the study students considered specialists (doctors, scientists) as a reference group, at the second stage - parents and close circle. Social media turned out to be the most insignificant source of information. Main conclusions. The data obtained make it possible to identify the main targets of psychological and pedagogical work with students and to determine the main methods of this work which should include the activity-based inclusion in the solution of group tasks aimed at optimizing the life of people in a pandemic. According to the results of the study a group of students stood out with a high level of fear experience (32%) and a tendency to non-constructive ways of coping. These students require targeted psychological assistance.

421451,Perspectives on passive antibody therapy and peptide-based vaccines against emerging pathogens like SARS-CoV-2,2021,"Coronaviruses have caused several human epidemics and pandemics including the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic antibodies have already shown striking effectiveness against COVID-19. Nevertheless, concerns remain about antigenic drift in SARS-CoV-2 as well as threats from other sarbecoviruses. Cross-neutralizing antibodies to SARS-related viruses provide opportunities to address such concerns. Here, we report on crystal structures of a cross-neutralizing antibody, CV38-142, in complex with the receptor-binding domains from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Recognition of the N343 glycosylation site and water-mediated interactions facilitate cross-reactivity of CV38-142 to SARS-related viruses, allowing the antibody to accommodate antigenic variation in these viruses. CV38-142 synergizes with other cross-neutralizing antibodies, notably COVA1-16, to enhance neutralization of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, including circulating variants of concern B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Overall, this study provides valuable information for vaccine and therapeutic design to address current and future antigenic drift in SARS-CoV-2 and to protect against zoonotic SARS-related coronaviruses.","Liu, Hejun; Yuan, Meng; Huang, Deli; Bangaru, Sandhya; Zhao, Fangzhu; Lee, Chang-Chun D; Peng, Linghang; Barman, Shawn; Zhu, Xueyong; Nemazee, David; Burton, Dennis R; van Gils, Marit J; Sanders, Rogier W; Kornau, Hans-Christian; Reincke, S Momsen; Prüss, Harald; Kreye, Jakob; Wu, Nicholas C; Ward, Andrew B; Wilson, Ian A",Cell Host Microbe,,414
421922,Swine enteric alphacoronavirus (swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus): An update three years after its discovery,2020,"The Italian outbreak of COVID-19 cases is a public health emergency and there is a worldwide tremendous interest in the evaluation of the Italian epidemic evolution. Indeed, from February 2020, Italy is facing an explosion of COVID-19 cases. In particular, the Italian observed case fatality rate (CFR) is much higher than the other countries. Recently, it has been hypothesized that the extensive number of intergenerational contacts-typical of Italian culture-could contribute to explain the high number of deaths observed in Italy. However, through an analysis performed for all the Italian regions, here it is shown that the deaths are localized in specific regions and that the CFRs of different Italian regions are overlapping with the rates of European countries. Moreover, through correlation analyses between CFRs and different social habits, it is shown that no positive correlation is observed between social behaviors and CFRs. In conclusion, this analysis clearly rejects the possibility that social habits and intergenerational contacts can contribute to explaining such a profound effect on the number of deaths observed in Italy during the COVID-19 outbreak and more effort should be addressed to evaluate the real amount of positive cases.","Giangreco, Giovanni",J Med Virol,,414

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 4530 critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to three tertiary care hospitals in New York City from March 1 to June 30, 2020 to identify patients who had more than one brain MRI. We reviewed the initial and final MRI for each patient to (1) measure the percent change in the bicaudate index and third ventricular diameter and (2) evaluate changes in the presence and severity of white matter changes. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients had two MRIs separated by a median of 22 [Interquartile range (IQR) 14-30] days. Ventricle size increased for 15 patients (71%) between scans [median bicaudate index 0.16 (IQR 0.126-0.181) initially and 0.167 (IQR 0.138-0.203) on final imaging (p < 0.001); median third ventricular diameter 6.9 mm (IQR 5.4-10.3) initially and 7.2 mm (IQR 6.4-10.8) on final imaging (p < 0.001)]. Every patient had white matter changes on the initial and final MRI; between images, they worsened for seven patients (33%) and improved for three (14%). CONCLUSIONS: On serial imaging of critically ill patients with COVID-19, ventricle size frequently increased over several weeks. White matter changes were often unchanged, but in some cases they worsened or improved, demonstrating there is likely a spectrum of pathophysiological processes responsible for these changes.","Agarwal, Shashank; Melmed, Kara; Dogra, Siddhant; Jain, Rajan; Conway, Jenna; Galetta, Steven; Lewis, Ariane",Neurocritical care,,414

(Labiatae),2020,"Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced oncology clinicians and administrators in the United States to set priorities for cancer care owing to resource constraints. As oncology practices adapt to a contracted health care system, expertise gained from partnerships in low-resource settings can be used for guidance. This article provides a primer on priority setting in oncology and ethical guidance based on lessons learned from experience with cancer care priority setting in low-resource settings. Observations: Lessons learned from real-world experiences are myriad. First, in the setting of limited resources, a utilitarian approach to maximizing survival benefit should guide decision-making. Second, conflicting principles will often arise among stakeholders and decision makers. Third, fair decision-making procedures should be established to ensure moral legitimacy and accountability. Fourth, proactive safeguards must be implemented to protect vulnerable individuals, or disparities in cancer treatment and outcomes will only widen further. Fifth, communication with patients and families about priority setting decisions should be intentional and standardized. Sixth, moral distress among clinicians must be addressed to avoid burnout during a time when resilience is critical. Conclusions and Relevance: Although the need to triage cancer care may be new to those who underwent training and now practice oncology in high-resource settings, it is familiar for those who practice in low- and middle-income countries. Oncologists in the United States facing unprecedented decisions about prioritization can draw on ethical frameworks and lessons learned from real-world cancer care priority setting in resource-constrained environments.","DeBoer, Rebecca J; Fadelu, Temidayo A; Shulman, Lawrence N; Van Loon, Katherine",JAMA Oncol,,414

The patient was initially evaluated at hospital A on February 15; at that time, COVID-19 was not suspected, as the patient denied travel or contact with symptomatic persons. During a 4-day hospitalization, the patient was managed with standard precautions and underwent multiple aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), including nebulizer treatments, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation, endotracheal intubation, and bronchoscopy. Several days after the patient's transfer to hospital B, a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 returned positive. Among 121 hospital A health care personnel (HCP) who were exposed to the patient, 43 (35.5%) developed symptoms during the 14 days after exposure and were tested for SARS-CoV-2; three had positive test results and were among the first known cases of probable occupational transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to HCP in the United States. Little is known about specific risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in health care settings. To better characterize and compare exposures among HCP who did and did not develop COVID-19, standardized interviews were conducted with 37 hospital A HCP who were tested for SARS-CoV-2, including the three who had positive test results. Performing physical examinations and exposure to the patient during nebulizer treatments were more common among HCP with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 than among those without COVID-19; HCP with COVID-19 also had exposures of longer duration to the patient. Because transmission-based precautions were not in use, no HCP wore personal protective equipment (PPE) recommended for COVID-19 patient care during contact with the index patient. Health care facilities should emphasize early recognition and isolation of patients with possible COVID-19 and use of recommended PPE to minimize unprotected, high-risk HCP exposures and protect the health care workforce.","Heinzerling, Amy; Stuckey, Matthew J; Scheuer, Tara; Xu, Kerui; Perkins, Kiran M; Resseger, Heather; Magill, Shelley; Verani, Jennifer R; Jain, Seema; Acosta, Meileen; Epson, Erin",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,414

431745,Exploring algae and cyanobacteria as a promising natural source of antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2,2020,"In this paper, we develop an extension of standard epidemiological models, suitable for COVID-19. This extension incorporates the transmission due to pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers of the virus. Furthermore, this model also captures the spread of the disease due to the movement of people to/from different administrative boundaries within a country. The model describes the probabilistic rise in the number of confirmed cases due to the concomitant effects of (incipient) human transmission and multiple compartments. The associated parameters in the model can help architect the public health policy and operational management of the pandemic. For instance, this model demonstrates that increasing the testing for symptomatic patients does not have any major effect on the progression of the pandemic, but testing rate of the asymptomatic population has an extremely crucial role to play. The model is executed using the data obtained for the state of Chhattisgarh in the Republic of India. The model is shown to have significantly better predictive capability than the other epidemiological models. This model can be readily applied to any administrative boundary (state or country). Moreover, this model can be applied for any other epidemic as well.","Ghatak, Anirban; Patel, Shivshanker Singh; Bonnerjee, Soham; Roy, Subhrajyoty",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.09686v1.pdf,414

Eight 1/2 Holstein/Zebu cows (497 ± 50 kg) were distributed in two 4 x 4 Latin squares, with 2 x 2 factorial treatments (100% mineral salt versus nitrogen salt containing 25:25:50% urea: corn: mineral salt, and 1.5 versus 3.0 kg d-1 concentrate per cow). The experiment lasted 56 days, divided into four periods of 14 days, the last seven days for data collection. No interaction effect (p > 0.05) was detected between the supplement and the different levels of concentrate for any of the evaluated variables. No effect (p > 0.05) of supplement or concentrate level was observed on urinary excretions of purine derivatives, microbial nitrogen compounds and microbial efficiency. Nitrogen salt increased (p < 0.05) nitrogen intake and increased urinary nitrogen excretion, leading to a reduced nitrogen balance, while the higher concentrate level increased (p < 0.05) nitrogen intake and the total amount of nitrogen excreted in milk. Therefore, it is recommended, for crossbred cows in the rainy-dry transition period, the supply of 1.5 kg d-1 concentrate during milking, using only mineral salt instead of nitrogen salt at will on pasture.(AU)","Gutierrez, Gabriela Santistevan; Lana, Rogério de Paula; Teixeira, Cesar Roberto Viana; Rennó, Luciana Navajas; Veloso, Cristina Mattos",Acta Sci.

METHODS: Salivary samples of 25 COVID-19 patients were analyzed by rRT-PCR. The following data were collected: age, sex, comorbidities, drugs. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ultrasensitive reactive C protein (usRCP) values were registered on the same day when a salivary swab was collected. Prevalence of positivity in saliva and association between clinical data and the cycle threshold as a semiquantitative indicator of viral load were considered. RESULTS: Twenty-five subjects were recruited into this study, 17 males and 8 females. The mean age was 61.5 +/- 11.2 years. Cardiovascular and/or dysmetabolic disorders were observed in 65.22% of cases. All the samples tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, while there was an inverse association between LDH and Ct values. Two patients showed positive salivary results on the same days when their pharyngeal or respiratory swabs showed conversion. CONCLUSIONS: Saliva is a reliable tool to detect SARS-CoV-2. The role of saliva in COVID-19 diagnosis could not be limited to a qualitative detection of the virus, but it may also provide information about the clinical evolution of the disease.","Azzi, Lorenzo; Carcano, Giulio; Gianfagna, Francesco; Grossi, Paolo; Gasperina, Daniela Dalla; Genoni, Angelo; Fasano, Mauro; Sessa, Fausto; Tettamanti, Lucia; Carinci, Francesco; Maurino, Vittorio; Rossi, Agostino; Tagliabue, Angelo; Baj, Andreina",J Infect,,414

The statement of the rarity or commonness of various minerals provide juries with additional context for the interpreting the results of a forensic soil comparison within the framework of a trial. The grain count data at specific locations can also be assessed to aid in soil provenance investigations, for cases where there are grain-counted sites in relevant locations. Two examples of application of these to data to soil evidence are included, one relating soil the rarity of a mineral (andalusite) to provide context in a soil comparison and one to aid in narrowing target regions in a soil provenance investigation.","Stern, Libby A; Webb, Jodi B; Ingham, Jennifer; Monteith, Steven; Saginor, Ian",J. forensic sci,,414
434539,Evaluation of the Antiviral Activity of Sitagliptin-Glatiramer Acetate Nano-Conjugates against SARS-CoV-2 Virus,2021,"BACKGROUND: Syria has suffered for nine years from a conflict that left over 11.1 million inhabitants in need of humanitarian assistance and over 80% in poverty. A ten-week-long full lockdown was enforced in Syria and successfully minimized the spread of COVID-19. This study aims to estimate the occurrence of mental health disorders after lockdown termination among the citizens of war-torn Syria. METHODS: Online questionnaires, which included demographic and war-related questions, Dimensions of Anger Reactions 5 (DAR-5) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) were distributed to different social media groups. RESULTS: This study recruited 1445 participants, of which 515 (35.6%) were males, the mean age was 24.8 +/- 6.3 years, 38% had problematic anger, 64% had moderate to very severe depression, 42.9% had moderate to severe anxiety and 39.7% had moderate to severe stress. Increased living expenses, not being able to go out and a reduced ability to earn income and provide food were significantly associated with the psychological burden after the lockdown (p &lt; 0.05). The association of war variables with mental disorders was weaker than the effect of the deteriorating economy. Other healthcare workers had more severe distress than doctors, who themselves were found to have less distress than the general population (p &lt; 0.05). Anger scores were approximately equal, regardless of the type of work. Finally, shisha smoking was associated with worse mental health (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: The psychological burden of the damaged economy surpassed the direct damage due to COVID-19 and the effect of years of conflict. Urgent interventions are required, as this burden may continue for years, if not for decades. A full lockdown in countries with fragile economies may delay the spread of the virus, but it will severely damage the economy, which will lead to a deterioration of the mental health of their citizens.","Kakaje, A.; Mansour, S.; Ghareeb, A.",Qatar Medical Journal,,414

After completion of a nasal symptom questionnaire, topical fluorescein spray was administered into the nasal and oropharynx of 10 healthy volunteers, who then underwent flexible laryngoscopy under 2 conditions: routine without provoked response and with prompted sneeze/cough. After each, droplets on the proceduralist and participant were counted under ultraviolet A light. Droplets were observed on 1 of 10 volunteers after routine laryngoscopy and 4 of 10 during laryngoscopy with sneeze/cough. A nasal symptom score based on congestion and rhinorrhea was significantly elevated among droplet producers after sneeze/cough (P = .0164). No droplets were observed on the provider. Overall, with adequate personal protective equipment, flexible laryngoscopy poses minimal droplet risk to providers. Nasal symptoms can identify patients more likely to produce droplets after sneeze/cough.","Ye, Michael J; Sharma, Dhruv; Rubel, Kolin E; Lebo, Nicole L; Burgin, Sarah J; Illing, Elisa A; Ting, Jonathan Y; Moore, Michael G; Yesensky, Jessica A; Mantravadi, Avinash V; Sim, Michael W",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,414

METHODS: Data were ollected on the epidemic situation of COVID-19 in various countries as of January 16, 2021, and the scale and overall trend of the epidemic were retrospectively described;combined with the recent trend of newly confirmed cases, from January 10 to 16 (the 54th week) and the newly confirmed cases indexes, such as the number and incidence density the severity of the epidemic was classified. Feasible suggestions were put forward based on the variation of the virus, actual data of vaccine research and development and possible existence in many countries. RESULTS: Up to January 16, 2021, there were 92 510 419 confirmed cases worldwide;4 849 301 new confirmed cases were confirmed in the 54th week, and they were still growing. Among all the continents, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Europe, North America, and Asia has exceeded 21 million, and the number of new confirmed cases in a single week in North America, South America and Asia were all increasing. Among the countries, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in 18 countries including the United States, India, and Brazil was more than 1 million, accounting for 77.04% of the total number of cumulative confirmed cases in the world. Eleven countries including the United States, Brazil, France, Spain, Colombia, The United Kingdom, Russia, Germany, South Africa, Italy, and India are at higher risk of the epidemic;The United States, Brazil, France, Spain, and Colombia were still experiencing new confirmed cases and increasing status, the risk of the epidemic was greater. Novel coronavirus mutates frequently, up to February 2021, there had been 3 931 mutant genotypes in the world. At the same time, a total of 11 vaccines were successfully launched, however we were still facing some troubles, such as the global shortage of vaccines, the public's willingness to vaccinate needed to be improved, and equity in the distribution of vaccines. CONCLUSION: The global epidemic situation is still getting worse, with repeated epidemics in all the continents and countries, and has not been fundamentally controlled. At the continent level, North America, South America, and Europe have the most severe epidemics;at the national level, The United States, Brazil, France, Spain, Colombia and other countries have higher epidemic risks. Focusing on the severely affected countries will help bring the global epidemic under control as soon as possible. Under the premise of ensuring the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, it is a key and feasible direction to improve the yield and vaccination rate of the vaccines, shorten the onset time of the vaccines and prolong the immune persistence.","Huang, B.; Wang, H.

436344,Cell type resolved quantitative proteomics map of interferon response against SARS-CoV-2,2021,"Antibody therapy may be an alternative treatment option for infections caused by the multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacterium Acinetobacter baumannii. As A. baumannii has multiple capsular serotypes, a universal antibody therapy would need to target conserved protein antigens rather than the capsular polysaccharides. We have immunized mice with single or multiple A. baumannii strains to induce antibody responses to protein antigens, and then assessed whether these responses provide cross-protection against a collection of genetically diverse clinical A. baumannii isolates. Immunized mice developed antibody responses to multiple protein antigens. Flow cytometry IgG binding assays and immunoblots demonstrated improved recognition of both homologous and heterologous clinical strains in sera from mice immunized with multiple strains compared to a single strain. The capsule partially inhibited bacterial recognition by IgG and the promotion of phagocytosis by human neutrophils. However, after immunization with multiple strains, serum antibodies to protein antigens promoted neutrophil phagocytosis of heterologous A. baumannii strains. In an infection model, mice immunized with multiple strains had lower bacterial counts in the spleen and liver following challenge with a heterologous strain. These data demonstrate that antibodies targeting protein antigens can improve immune recognition and protection against diverse A. baumannii strains, providing support for their use as an antibody therapy.","Kamuyu, Gathoni; Suen Cheng, Yat; Willcocks, Sam; Kewcharoenwong, Chidchamai; Kiratisin, Pattarachai; Taylor, Peter W; Wren, Brendan W; Lertmemongkolchai, Ganjana; Stabler, Richard A; Brown, Jeremy",Front Immunol,,414

The current study examines COVID-19-specific anxiety and proactive coping as potential risk and resilience factors that may be differentially important for younger and older adults in understanding stress experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Five hundred and fifteen adults aged 20-79 in the U.S. reported on their anxiety about developing COVID-19, proactive coping, and stress related to COVID-19 in an online survey. RESULTS: Although there were no age differences in stress levels, anxiety about developing COVID-19 was associated with more COVID-19 stress for older adults relative to younger adults, but proactive coping was associated with less COVID-19 stress for older adults relative to younger adults. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that anxiety might function as a risk factor whereas proactive coping may function as a resilience factor for older adults' COVID-19 stress. We encourage future context-dependent investigations into mental health among older adults during this pandemic and beyond.","Pearman, Ann; Hughes, MacKenzie L; Smith, Emily L; Neupert, Shevaun D",J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci,,414

The preparation was realized by a simple two-step temperature-programmed process without heating operation. The obtained polymeric sub-microsphere exhibited monodisperse and regular spherical structure with uniform particle size distribution of 220-320 nm accounting for 94%. The prominent adsorption capacity of the polymeric sub-microsphere for antioxidants was demonstrated and attributed to the synergistic effect of the cladding interaction with the &#960;-electron rich cavity and hydrophilic interaction with terminal hydroxyl on pillar[5]arene. Then the pillar[5]arene sub-microsphere was packed into a micro-column to realize effective on-line enrichment of antioxidants coupling with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The flow rate of extraction and desorption solvent, clean-up and desorption volume were assessed to optimize the method. The method showed wide linear ranges with R2 greater than 0.9926, low limits of detection (0.030-0.20 µg/L) and limits of quantification (0.10-0.67 µg/L).

Previous reviews have summarized social media uses for a specific health purpose such as health interventions, health campaigns, medical education, and disease outbreak surveillance. The most recent comprehensive review of social media uses for health purposes, however, was conducted in 2013. A systematic review that covers various health purposes is needed to reveal the new usages and research gaps that emerge in recent years. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide a systematic review of social media uses for health purposes that have been identified in previous studies. METHODS: The researchers searched for peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2006 and 2020 in 12 databases covering medicine, public health, and social science. After coding the articles in terms of publication year, journal area, country, method, social media platform, and social media use for health purposes, the researchers provided a review of social media use for health purposes identified in these articles. RESULTS: This study summarized 10 social media uses for various health purposes by health institutions, health researchers and practitioners, and the public. CONCLUSIONS: Social media can be used for various health purposes. Several new usages have emerged since 2013 including advancing health research and practice, social mobilization, and facilitating offline health-related services and events. Research gaps exist regarding advancing strategic use of social media based on audience segmentation, evaluating the impact of social media in health interventions, understanding the impact of health identity development, and addressing privacy concerns.","Chen, Junhan; Wang, Yuan",J Med Internet Res,,414

A subset of patients suffer serious consequences that require hospitalization and ventilator support. Current tests for SARS-CoV-2 generate qualitative results and are vital to make a diagnosis of the infection. However, they are not helpful to follow changes in viral loads after diagnosis. The ability to quantitatively assess viral levels is necessary to determine the effectiveness of therapy with anti-viral or immune agents. Viral load analysis is also necessary to determine the replicative potential of strains with different mutations, emergence of resistance to anti-viral agents and the stability of viral nucleic acid and degree of RT-PCR inhibition in different types of collection media. Quantitative viral load analysis in body fluids, plasma and tissue may be helpful to determine the effects of the infection in various organ systems. To address these needs, we developed two assays to quantitate SARS-CoV-2. The assays target either the S or E genes in the virus, produce comparable viral load results, are highly sensitive and specific and have a wide range of quantitation. We believe that these assays will be helpful to manage the clinical course of infected patients and may also help to better understand the biology of infection with SARS-CoV-2.","Bland, Joshua; Kavanaugh, Ashley; Hong, Lenny K; Kadkol, Shrihari S",J Virol Methods,,414

OBJECTIVES: We present a case series of coronavirus disease 2019 patients from two institutions with acute cerebrovascular pathologies. In addition, we present a pooled analysis of published data on large vessel occlusion in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 and a concise summary of the pathophysiology of acute cerebrovascular disease in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS: A retrospective study across two institutions was conducted between 20 March 2020 and 20 May 2020, for patients developing acute cerebrovascular disease and diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019. We performed a literature review using the PubMed search engine. RESULTS: The total sample size was 22 patients. The mean age was 59.5 years, and 12 patients were female. The cerebrovascular pathologies were 17 cases of acute ischemic stroke, 3 cases of aneurysm rupture, and 2 cases of sinus thrombosis. Of the stroke and sinus thrombosis patients, the mean National Institute of Health Stroke Scale was 13.8 ± 8.0, and 16 (84.2%) patients underwent a mechanical thrombectomy procedure. A favorable thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score was achieved in all patients. Of the 16 patients that underwent a mechanical thrombectomy, the mortality incidence was five (31.3%). Of all patients (22), three (13.6%) patients developed hemorrhagic conversion requiring decompressive surgery. Eleven (50%) patients had a poor functional status (modified Rankin Score 3-6) at discharge, and the total mortality incidence was eight (36.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite timely intervention and favorable reperfusion, the mortality rate in coronavirus disease 2019 patients with large vessel occlusion was high in our series and in the pooled analysis. Notable features were younger age group, involvement of both the arterial and venous vasculature, multivessel involvement, and complicated procedures due to the clot consistency and burden.","Sweid, Ahmad; Hammoud, Batoul; Bekelis, Kimon; Missios, Symeon; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula I; Gooch, Michael R; Herial, Nabeel A; Zarzour, Hekmat; Romo, Victor; DePrince, Maureen; Rosenwasser, Robert H; Jabbour, Pascal",Int J Stroke,,414

455796,Multiple approaches for massively parallel sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes directly from clinical samples,2020,"BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Canada may create substantial demand for hospital admission and critical care. We evaluated the extent to which self-isolation of mildly ill people delays the peak of outbreaks and reduces the need for this care in each Canadian province. METHODS: We developed a computational model and simulated scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks within each province. Using estimates of COVID-19 characteristics, we projected the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) bed requirements without self-isolation, assuming an average number of 2.5 secondary cases, and compared scenarios in which different proportions of mildly ill people practised self-isolation 24 hours after symptom onset. RESULTS: Without self-isolation, the peak of outbreaks would occur in the first half of June, and an average of 569 ICU bed days per 10 000 population would be needed. When 20% of cases practised self-isolation, the peak was delayed by 2-4 weeks, and ICU bed requirement was reduced by 23.5% compared with no self-isolation. Increasing self-isolation to 40% reduced ICU use by 53.6% and delayed the peak of infection by an additional 2-4 weeks. Assuming current ICU bed occupancy rates above 80% and self-isolation of 40%, demand would still exceed available (unoccupied) ICU bed capacity. INTERPRETATION: At the peak of COVID-19 outbreaks, the need for ICU beds will exceed the total number of ICU beds even with self-isolation at 40%. Our results show the coming challenge for the health care system in Canada and the potential role of self-isolation in reducing demand for hospital-based and ICU care.","Shoukat, Affan; Wells, Chad R; Langley, Joanne M; Singer, Burton H; Galvani, Alison P; Moghadas, Seyed M",CMAJ,,414

Obesity has been associated with an important role in disease development and a worse prognosis. We aimed to explore epidemiological data from Brazil, discussing the potential relationships between obesity and COVID-19 severity in this country. We used a public database made available by the Ministry of Health of Brazil (182700 patients diagnosed with COVID-19). Descriptive statistics were used to characterize our database. Continuous data were expressed as median and analyzed by the nonparametric tests Mann–Whitney or one-sample Wilcoxon. The frequencies of categorical variables have been analyzed by chi-square tests of independence or goodness-of-fit. Among the number of deaths, 74% of patients were 60 years of age or older. Patients with obesity who died of COVID-19 were younger (59 years (IQR = 23)) than those without obesity (71 years (IQR = 20), P &lt; 0.001 , and η2 = 0.0424). Women with obesity who died of COVID-19 were older than men (55 years (IQR = 25) vs. 50 (IQR = 22), P &lt; 0.001 , and η2 = 0.0263). Furthermore, obesity increases the chances of needing intensive care unit (OR: 1.783, CI: 95%, and P &lt; 0.001), needing ventilatory support (OR: 1.537, CI: 95%, and P &lt; 0.001 and OR: 2.302, CI: 95%, and P &lt; 0.001 , for noninvasive and invasive, respectively), and death (OR: 1.411, CI: 95%, and P &lt; 0.001) of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Our analysis supports obesity as a significant risk factor for the development of more severe forms of COVID-19.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-institution retrospective study included 240 patients with breast cancer (mean age, 45.1 ± 2.8 years) detected by US or mammography who had undergone breast surgery between 2003 and 2008. Medical records were reviewed for clinicopathologic characteristics and detection methods. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between patients with breast cancer in the US and mammography groups using the log-rank test. Multivariate cox regression analysis was used to identify independent variables associated with DFS and OS. RESULTS: Among the 240 cases of breast cancer, 43 were detected by supplemental screening US and 197 by screening mammography (mean follow-up: 7.4 years, 93.3% with dense breasts). There were 19 recurrences and 16 deaths, all occurring in the mammography group. While the US group did not differ from the mammography group in tumor stage, the patients in this group were more likely to undergo breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy than the mammography group. The US group also showed better DFS (p = 0.016); however, OS did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.058). In the multivariate analysis, the US group showed a lower risk of recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.097; 95% confidence interval, 0.001-0.705) compared to the mammography group. CONCLUSION: Our study found that Korean females aged 40-49 years with US-detected breast cancer showed better DFS than those with mammography-detected breast cancer.

Here, we describe two women infected with SARS-CoV-2 whose real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results and symptoms changed during the menstrual cycle. The first patient developed a fever on the first day of her menstrual period, and again on the first day of her next menstrual period after hospital discharge. RT-PCR test results were positive during the first menstrual period before admission, but turned negative during hospitalization, and then were positive again during the second menstrual period after hospital discharge. Another one also developed a fever again on the first day of her menstrual period after hospital discharge. RT-PCR test results were negative before admission and during hospitalization, but turned positive during the first menstrual period after hospital discharge. The cases indicate sex hormones may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS: Prognostic value of SpO2/FiO2 was evaluated by jointly modeling the longitudinal responses of SpO2/FiO2 and time-to-event data retrieved from 280 severe and critically ill (intensive care) patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: A sharply decrease of SpO2/FiO2 from the first to second measurement for non-survivors was observed, and a strong association between square root SpO2/FiO2 and mortality risk was demonstrated, with a unit decrease in the marker corresponding to 1.82-fold increase in mortality risk (95% CI: 1.56-2.13). CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggested that SpO2/FiO2 could serve as a non-invasive prognostic marker to facilitate early adjustment for treatment, thus improving overall survival.","Lu, Xiaofan; Jiang, Liyun; Chen, Taige; Wang, Yang; Zhang, Bing; Hong, Yizhou; Wang, Jun; Yan, Fangrong",Respir Res,,414

466935,Identification of Potent and Safe Antiviral Therapeutic Candidates Against SARS-CoV-2,2020,"We recently reported that inhibitors against human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) have broad-spectrum antiviral activities including their inhibitory efficacies on SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected cells. However, there are limited data from clinical studies to prove the application of DHODH inhibitors in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. In the present study, we evaluated Leflunomide, an approved DHODH inhibitor widely used as a modest immune regulator to treat autoimmune diseases, in treating COVID-19 disease with a small-scale of patients. Cases of 10 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients of moderate type with obvious opacity in the lung were included. Five of the patients were treated with Leflunomide, and another five were treated as blank controls without a placebo. All the patients accepted standard supportive treatment for COVID-19. The patients given Leflunomide had a shorter viral shedding time (median of 5 days) than the controls (median of 11 days, P = 0.046). The patients given Leflunomide also showed a significant reduction in C-reactive protein levels, indicating that immunopathological inflammation was well controlled. No obvious adverse effects were observed in Leflunomide-treated patients, and they all discharged from the hospital faster than controls. This preliminary study on a small-scale compassionate use of Leflunomide provides clues for further understanding of Leflunomide as a potential antiviral drug against COVID-19.","Hu, Ke; Wang, Mengmei; Zhao, Yang; Zhang, Yunting; Wang, Tao; Zheng, Zhishui; Li, Xiaochen; Zeng, Shaolin; Zhao, Dong; Li, Honglin; Xu, Ke; Lan, Ke",Virol. sin.

468084,SARS-CoV-2 Entry Inhibitors: Small Molecules and Peptides Targeting Virus or Host Cells,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To measure the effects of the tier system on the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns, before the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern. DESIGN: This is a modelling study combining estimates of real-time reproduction number Rt (derived from UK case, death and serological survey data) with publicly available data on regional non-pharmaceutical interventions. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from tiers. SETTING: The UK at lower tier local authority (LTLA) level. 310 LTLAs were included in the analysis. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Reduction in real-time reproduction number Rt . RESULTS: Nationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, Rt averaged 1.3 (0.9-1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86-1.42) 2 weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3, respectively, reduced transmission by 6% (5%-7%) and 23% (21%-25%). 288 LTLAs (93%) would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 90 (29%) did so in reality. CONCLUSIONS: The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.","Laydon, Daniel J; Mishra, Swapnil; Hinsley, Wes R; Samartsidis, Pantelis; Flaxman, Seth; Gandy, Axel; Ferguson, Neil M; Bhatt, Samir",BMJ Open,,414

The characteristics of patients with diabetes vulnerable to this infection are less specified. We aim to present the characteristics of patients with diabetes admitted to hospital with COVID-19. DESIGN: A retrospective case series. SETTING: A single clinical centre in the UK. METHODS: We have retrospectively collected the demographics, medical characteristics and outcome of all patients with diabetes admitted to hospital over two-week period with COVID-19 infection. All cases were diagnosed by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of pharyngeal and nasal swabs. RESULTS: A total of 71 COVID-19 patients were admitted during the study period of whom 16 (22.5%) patients had diabetes and were included in this case series. There was no significant difference between patients with compared to those without diabetes regarding age, gender or clinical presentation. However, comorbidities were more common in patients with diabetes specially hypertension {75% v 36.4%, a difference of 38.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.5-58.3} and chronic kidney disease (37.5 v 5.5, a difference of 32% (1.6-51.6). Patients with diabetes were significantly more obese than those without diabetes (56.2% v 21.8% a difference of 34.4%, 95% CI 7.7-61.1). About one third (31.3%) of patients with diabetes were frail. Mean {standard deviation (SD)} duration of diabetes was 10 (2.8) years and mean (SD) HbA1c was 60.3 (15.6) mmol/mol. The use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was common (37.5%, 25% and 18.8% respectively). There was no significant difference in the outcomes between patients with compared to those without diabetes. CONCLUSION: Patients with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19 were significantly more obese and had high prevalence of comorbidities than those without diabetes. Other features of patients with diabetes and COVID-19 infection included long duration of diabetes, less tight glycaemic control and common use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs and NSAIDs.","Conway, J; Gould, A; Westley, R; Raju, S A; Oklopcic, A; Broadbent, A; Abdelhafiz, A H; Sinclair, A J",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,414

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: For this study we used a cohort of runners participating in an ongoing randomized controlled trial on running injury prevention among recreational runners. At baseline, demographic and training variables were collected. Seven weeks after starting the lockdown, information on running behavior (interval training, training with partner and physical distancing during training) and running habits (training frequency, duration, distance and speed) were obtained. Furthermore, healthcare utilization and symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 were assessed. To determine the association between running and symptoms suggestive for COVID-19, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of the 2586 included participants, 2427 (93.9%) participants continued running during lockdown with no significant changes in mean weekly training variables. A total of 253 participants (9.8%) experienced symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 and 10 participants tested positive for COVID-19. Two participants were admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 with both one day of admission. Running behavior and running habits were not associated with the onset of symptoms suggestive for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The large majority of runners in the Netherlands did not change their running habits during lockdown. No association between running behavior or running habits and onset of symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 was identified.

473100,SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor gene ACE2 -mediated immunomodulation in breast cancer subtypes,2020,"OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to evaluate the prevalence and prognosis of otorhinolaryngological symptoms in patients with the diagnosed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases was performed up to August 19, 2020.We included studies that reported infections with COVID-19 and symptoms of otolaryngology. The retrieved data from the respective studies were evaluated and summarized. The study's immediate result was to assess the combined prevalence of otorhinolaryngological symptoms in patients with COVID-19. However, the secondary result was to determine the exacerbation of COVID-19 infection in patients with otorhinolaryngological symptoms. RESULTS: Fifty-four studies with 16,478 patients were included. Olfactory dysfunction, sneezing and sputum production were the 3 most prevalent otorhinolaryngological symptoms in patients with COVID-19. The pooled prevalence amongst the prevalent symptoms was 47% (95% CI 29-65; range 0-98; I2 = 99.58%), 27% (95% CI 11-48; range 12-40; I2 = 93.34%), and 22% (95% CI 16-30; range 2-56; I2 = 97.60%), respectively. The proportion of severely ill patients with sputum production and shortness of breath was significantly higher among patients with COVID-19 infections (OR 1.66 [95% CI 1.08-2.54]; P = 0.02, I2 = 51% and 3.29 [95% CI 1.57-6.90]; P = 0.002, I2 = 49%, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed no statistically significant differences between the incidence of otolaryngology symptoms in severely ill patients and non-severely ill patients (OR 1.43 [95% CI 1.12-1.82]; P = 0.07 I2 = 53.1%). In contrast, the incidence of shortness of breath in severely ill patients was significantly increased (3.29 [1.57-6.90]; P = 0.002, I2 = 49%). CONCLUSION: Our research shows that otorhinolaryngology symptoms in patients with COVID-19 are not uncommon, which should attract otorhinolaryngologists' attention.","Qiu, Jingjing; Yang, Xin; Liu, Limei; Wu, Ting; Cui, Limei; Mou, Yakui; Sun, Yan",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,414

474586,Genome composition and genetic characterization of SARS-CoV-2,2021,"A recent retrospective study has provided evidence that COVID-19 infection may be notably less common in those using supplemental melatonin. It is suggested that this phenomenon may reflect the fact that, via induction of silent information regulator 1 (Sirt1), melatonin can upregulate K63 polyubiquitination of the mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein, thereby boosting virally mediated induction of type 1 interferons. Moreover, Sirt1 may enhance the antiviral efficacy of type 1 interferons by preventing hyperacetylation of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), enabling its retention in the nucleus, where it promotes transcription of interferon-inducible genes. This nuclear retention of HMGB1 may also be a mediator of the anti-inflammatory effect of melatonin therapy in COVID-19-complementing melatonin's suppression of nuclear factor kappa B activity and upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2. If these speculations are correct, a nutraceutical regimen including vitamin D, zinc and melatonin supplementation may have general utility for the prevention and treatment of RNA virus infections, such as COVID-19 and influenza.","DiNicolantonio, James J; McCarty, Mark; Barroso-Aranda, Jorge",,,414

A serial, weekly, nationally representative, cross-sectional, observational study of randomly selected adults was conducted in Scotland during June and July 2020. If available, validated instruments were used to measure psychological distress, individual demographics, illness beliefs, and the following characteristics: Rurality, area deprivation, access to residential outside space, frequency of visiting, and duration in green space. Simple linear regressions followed by examination of moderation effect were conducted. There were 2969 participants in Study 1, of which 1765 (59.6%) were female, 349 (11.9%) were in the shielding category, and the median age was 54 years. There were 502 participants in Study 2, of which 295 (58.60%) were female, 58 (11.6%) were in shielding category, and the median age was 53 years. Direct effects showed that psychological distress was worse if participants reported the following: Urban, in a deprived area, no access to or sharing residential outside space, fewer visits to green space (environment), younger, female, in the shielding category (demographics), worse illness (COVID-19) representations, and greater threat perception (illness beliefs). Moderation analyses showed that environmental factors amplified the direct effects of the individual factors on psychological distress. This study offers pointers for public health and for environmental planning, design, and management, including housing design and public open space provision and regulation.","Hubbard, Gill; Daas, Chantal den; Johnston, Marie; Murchie, Peter; Thompson, Catharine Ward; Dixon, Diane",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,414
477558,Molecular determinants and mechanism for antibody cocktail preventing SARS-CoV-2 escape,2021,"PURPOSE: The aim of this systematic review was to compare the success rate of five tooth-coloured materials, namely Glass Ionomer (GI), Resin-Modified Glass Ionomer (RMGI), Composite Resin (CR), Polyacid-Modified Composite Resin or Compomer (CO) and High-Viscosity Glass Ionomer (HVGI) in primary molar Class II restorations. METHODS: Five databases were searched from inception to April 23, 2020 for randomized clinical trials comparing the failure rate of these materials. After duplicate study removal, data extraction and risk of bias assessment with the Cochrane tool, data synthesis was conducted, comparing all five tooth-coloured materials in pairs and computing the overall success rate for each one, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 5615 articles were obtained by electronic and hand literature search. After the application of the eligibility criteria, ten RCTs were included in this systematic review and six RCTs for meta-analysis. Their risk of bias was assessed to be high to moderate. Due to the small number of RCTs comparing the five restorative materials in pairs investigated in the same study, only three MAs were available for heterogeneity assessment. These were: (1) between CO-RMGI (RR 1.04 [0.59, 1.84]; p = 0.88; I2 = 1%), (2) CR-CO (RR 1.12 [0.41, 3.02]; p = 0.83; I2 = 57%), and (3) between CR-RMGI (RR 1.10 [0.74, 1.63]; p = 0.65; I2 = 0%). No statistically significant differences were found between the two materials in all three comparisons. CONCLUSION: CR, RMGI and CO presented no statistical differences. In comparison to other tooth-coloured materials, studies on GI were too few to allow recommendations about its use. More studies on HGVI are needed for evidence-based recommendations to be made. The evidence extracted from this meta-analysis was not strong enough (moderate), due to the small number of RCTs and the risk of bias ranging from high to moderate. More, well-designed RCTs comparing tooth-coloured materials for primary molar Class II restorations are necessary.","Vasileios, S; Thodoris, M; Nikolaos, K",Eur. Arch. Paediatr. Dent,,414

477848,Genomic characterization and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 of a Canadian population,2021,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To identify major barriers to video-based telehealth use among homebound older adults. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: A large home-based primary care (HBPC) program in New York City (NYC) serving 873 homebound patients living in the community. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen primary care physicians. MEASUREMENTS: An 11-item assessment of provider perceptions of patients' experience with and barriers to telehealth. RESULTS: According to physicians in the HBPC program, more than one-third (35%) of homebound patients (mean age of 82.7; 46.6% with dementia; mean of 4 comorbidities/patient) engaged in first-time video-based telehealth encounters between April and June 2020 during the first COVID-19 surge in NYC. The majority (82%) required assistance from a family member and/or paid caregiver to complete the visit. Among patients who had not used telehealth, providers deemed 27% (n = 153) ""unable to interact over video"" for reasons including cognitive or sensory impairment and 14% lacked access to a caregiver to assist them with technology. Physicians were not knowledgeable of their patients' internet connectivity, ability to pay for cellular plans, or video-capable device access. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a large and dramatic shift to video-based telehealth use in home-based primary care. However, 4 months into the pandemic a majority of patients had not participated in a video-based telehealth encounter due to a number of barriers. Patients lacking caregiver support to assist with technology may benefit from novel approaches such as the deployment of community health workers to assist with device setup. Physicians may not be able to identify potentially modifiable barriers to telehealth use among their patients, highlighting the need for better systematic data collection before targeted interventions to increase video-based telehealth use.","Kalicki, Alexander V; Moody, Kate A; Franzosa, Emily; Gliatto, Peter M; Ornstein, Katherine A",J. am. geriatr. soc,,414

Alphaviruses mainly target synovial fibroblasts and persists in the joints of patients, possibly leading to chronic arthritis. To date, no specific antiviral treatment is available for ONNV infection and induced-inflammation. Primary human synovial fibroblasts cells were used to assess infection by ONNV and the resulting cytokine responses. Phenolics (gallic acid, caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid, curcumin and quercetin) and a curcuminoids-rich extract from turmeric were tested for their antiviral and anti-inflammatory capacities. We showed that infection occurred in HSF cells and increased gene expression and protein secretion of two major proinflammatory CCL-2 and IL-1ß markers. In ONNV-infected HSF cells (MOI 1), we found that non-cytotoxic concentrations of phenolics (10 µM) reduced the level of viral RNA (E1, E2, nsP1, nsP2) and downregulated CCL-2 and IL-1ß expression and secretion. These results highlighted the high value of the flavonol quercetin to reduce viral RNA levels and inflammatory status induced by ONNV in HSF cells.","Septembre-Malaterre, Axelle; Bedoui, Yosra; Giry, Claude; Gasque, Philippe; Guiraud, Pascale; Sélambarom, Jimmy",Sci Rep,,414

The present report presents together the comprehensive knowledge derived from the major researches about the above drugs altogether in context of the current health emergency around the world. Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin were known to act by creating the acidic environment and inhibiting the importin (IMP&#945;/ß1) mediated viral import. Azithromycin was found to act similar to the hydroxychloroquine as an acidotropic lipophilic weak base. All the three categories of drugs seemed to potentially act against novel coronavirus infection.

Recently, at the end of December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases were reported from Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China, linked to a wet seafood market with a new coronavirus identified as the etiologic agent currently named SARS-CoV-2. Most cases are in Mainland China with international spread to 25 countries. The novelty of the virus, the rapid national and international spread, and the lack of therapeutic and preventative strategies have led the WHO International Health Regulation emergency committee to declare the disease as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. As it relates to countries with the ongoing MERS-CoV community cases and hospital acquired infections, there will be a huge challenge for HCWs to deal with both coronaviruses, especially with the lack of standardized and approved point of care testing. This challenge will now be faced by the whole global health community dealing with COVID-19 since both coronaviruses have similar presentation. Those patients should now be tested for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, and with the continuing wide international spread of SARS-CoV-2, the travel history to China in the last 14 days will be of less significance.","Barry, Mazin; Al Amri, Maha; Memish, Ziad A",J Epidemiol Glob Health,,414

Planning for the continued involvement of learners in patient care during this pandemic should include teaching learners professional formation. The authors provide an ethical framework to guide such teaching, based on the ethical principle of beneficence and the professional virtues of courage and self-sacrifice from professional ethics in medicine. The authors show that these concepts support the conclusion that learners are ethically obligated to accept reasonable, but not unreasonable, risk. Based on this ethical framework, the authors provide an account of the process of teaching professional formation that medical educators and academic leaders should implement. Medical educators and academic leaders should embrace the opportunity that the COVID-19 pandemic presents for teaching professional formation. Learners should acquire the conceptual vocabulary of professional formation. Learners should recognize that risk of infection from patients is unavoidable. Learners should become aware of established ethical standards for professional responsibility during epidemics from the history of medicine. Learners should master understandable fear. Medical educators and academic leaders should ensure that didactic teaching of professional formation continues when it becomes justified to end learners' participation in the processes of patient care; topics should include the professionally responsible management of scarce medical resources. The COVID-19 pandemic will not be the last major infectious disease that puts learners at risk.

This paper compares the early pandemic response in Singapore and Hong Kong, two Asian city-states of similar sizes, a shared history of SARS, and advanced medical systems. Although both were able to contain the virus, they did so using two very different approaches. Drawing upon data from a cross-national, probability sample Internet survey conducted in May 2020 as well as media and mobility data, we argue that the different approaches were the result of the relative strength of civil society vs. the state at the outset of the outbreak. In protest-ridden Hong Kong, low governmental trust bolstered civil society, which focused on self-mobilisation and community mutual-help. In Singapore, a state-led response model that marginalised civil society brought early success but failed to stem an outbreak among its segregated migrant population. Our findings show that an active civil society is pivotal to effective outbreak response and that trust in government may not have been as important as a factor in these contexts.","Yuen, Samson; Cheng, Edmund W; Or, Nick H K; Grépin, Karen A; Fu, King-Wa; Yung, Ka-Chun; Yue, Ricci P H",Glob Public Health,,414

484784,Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by Highly Potent Broad-Spectrum Anti-Coronaviral Tylophorine-Based Derivatives,2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) reinfection has been a topic of discussion with data still emerging. Viral antibodies are known to develop upon initial infection;however, it is unclear the amount of protection this confers against reinfection. Additionally, COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) is a well-documented phenomenon;however, there are no high-quality studies to support the treatment of outpatients beyond standard indications of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis. This case describes a patient with either COVID-19 reinfection or prolonged course of CAC resulting in pulmonary embolism (PE). Case summary: A 40-year-old healthy man presented with fever and cough. He tested positive for COVID-19 and was sent home to self-quarantine. His symptoms resolved and repeat COVID-19 testing returned negative. Two months later, he developed dyspnoea on exertion and syncope. Computed tomography with PE protocol demonstrated acute bilateral PE, and repeat COVID-19 testing returned positive. He was escalated to catheter-directed thrombolysis, but prior to the procedure went into cardiopulmonary arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated and full-dose systemic alteplase was administered. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for consideration of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation;however, return of spontaneous circulation was unable to be achieved. Discussion: This case raises the question of COVID-19 reinfection and prolonged risk of VTE due to CAC. We believe the patient was reinfected with COVID-19 provoking his PE;however, a single COVID-19 infection causing a prolonged course of CAC is possible. Until better data exists, decisions regarding outpatient prophylaxis must be individualized to weigh the risks of bleeding against the risk of thrombosis.","Pow, T.; Allen, S.; Brailovsky, Y.; Darki, A.",European Heart Journal - Case Reports,,414

However, its active compounds and mechanisms of action are still unknown. Firstly, we divided QFPD into five functional units (FUs) according to the compatibility theory of traditional Chinese medicine. The corresponding common targets of the five FUs were all significantly enriched in Go Ontology (oxidoreductase activity, lipid metabolic process, homeostatic process, etc.), KEGG pathways (steroid biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, adipocytokine signaling pathway, etc.), TTD diseases (chronic inflammatory diseases, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary Disease, etc.), miRNA (MIR183), kinase (CDK7) and TF (LXR). QFPD contained 257 specific targets in addition to HCoV, pneumonia and ACE2 co-expression proteins. Then, network topology analysis of the five components-target-pathway-disease networks yielded 67 active ingredients. In addition, ADMET estimations showed that 20 compounds passed the stringent lead-like criteria and in silico drug-likeness test with high gastrointestinal absorption and the median lethal dose (LD50 > 1600 mg/kg). Moreover, 4 specific ingredients (M3, S1, X2 and O2) and 5 common ingredients (MS1, MX16, SX1, WO1 and XO1) of QFPD presented good molecular docking score for 2019-nCov structure and non-structure proteins. Finally, drug perturbation of COVID-19 network robustness showed that all five FUs may protect COVID-19 independently, and target 8 specifically expressed drug-attacked nodes which were related to the bacterial and viral responses, immune system, signaling transduction, etc. In conclusion, our new FUNP analysis showed that QFPD had a protection effect on COVID-19 by regulating a complex molecular network with safety and efficacy. Part of the mechanism was associated with the regulation of anti-viral, anti-inflammatory activity and metabolic programming.","Chen, Jian; Wang, Yong-Kui; Gao, Yuan; Hu, Ling-San; Yang, Jiang-Wei; Wang, Jian-Ru; Sun, Wen-Jie; Liang, Zhi-Qiang; Cao, Ye-Min; Cao, Yong-Bing",Biomed Pharmacother,,414

487619,Distance matrices for nitrogenous bases and amino acids of SARS-CoV-2 via structural metric,2021,"BACKGROUND: Although novel teleconsultation solutions can deliver remote situations that are relatively similar to face-to-face interaction, remote assessment of heart rate and rhythm as well as risk factors remains challenging in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). HYPOTHESIS: Mobile health (mHealth) solutions can support remote AF management. METHODS: Herein, we discuss available mHealth tools and strategies on how to incorporate the remote assessment of heart rate, rhythm and risk factors to allow comprehensive AF management through teleconsultation. RESULTS: Particularly, in the light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is decreased capacity to see patients in the outpatient clinic and mHealth has become an important component of many AF outpatient clinics. Several validated mHealth solutions are available for remote heart rate and rhythm monitoring as well as for risk factor assessment. mHealth technologies can be used for (semi-)continuous longitudinal monitoring or for short-term on-demand monitoring, dependent on the respective requirements and clinical scenarios. As a possible solution to improve remote AF care through teleconsultation, we introduce the on-demand TeleCheck-AF mHealth approach that allows remote app-based assessment of heart rate and rhythm around teleconsultations, which has been developed and implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. CONCLUSION: Large scale international mHealth projects, such as TeleCheck-AF, will provide insight into the additional value and potential limitations of mHealth strategies to remotely manage AF patients. Such mHealth infrastructures may be well suited within an integrated AF-clinic, which may require redesign of practice and reform of health care systems.","Hermans, Astrid N L; van der Velden, Rachel M J; Gawalko, Monika; Verhaert, Dominique V M; Desteghe, Lien; Duncker, David; Manninger, Martin; Heidbuchel, Hein; Pisters, Ron; Hemels, Martin; Pison, Laurent; Sohaib, Afzal; Sultan, Arian; Steven, Daniel; Wijtvliet, Petra; Tieleman, Robert; Gupta, Dhiraj; Dobrev, Dobromir; Svennberg, Emma; Crijns, Harry J G M; Pluymaekers, Nikki A H A; Hendriks, Jeroen M; Linz, Dominik",Clin Cardiol,,414

Healthcare workers are the high-risk group to endure the emotional outcomes brought about by the outbreak. This study assesses the mental consequences of healthcare workers during the acute phase of COVID-19 pandemic in Tehran. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional study on healthcare workers from two tertiary referral hospitals in Tehran province. A total of 222 of the staff participated in the study. Our questionnaires comprised Impact of Event Scale- Revised (IES-R) and 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), which were handed to participants to obtain data on their general mental problems in addition to the psychological impacts of the evolving virus on this particular group. Epidemiologic and sociodemographic information of participants, level of perceiving exposure to disease, and underlying diseases of each of them were gathered during the recruitment period. Results: Results showed high probabilities (98.2%) in mental disorders among healthcare workers. Since our study was done during the initial phase of the pandemic, development of mental issues due to the newly emerged infectious virus was expected. However, we recorded mild (41.4%) to moderate (31.5%) impact of this novel virus. The possibility of having mental problems was much higher in females, assistant nurses, individuals with lower education, and those who provided care for COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: COVID-19 has brought about increased distress among healthcare workers. Noticeably, the forefront group in combating this virus bear the most emotional complications. Thus, efforts should be taken into practice to provide proper psychological support for this vulnerable group.

488662,Optical Detection of CoV-SARS-2 Viral Proteins to Sub-Picomolar Concentrations,2021,"Besides the conventional extracorporeal circulation, commonly used in cardiac surgery, the methods of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) have been applied ever more frequently in thoracic surgery in recent years. The most commonly used modalities of such supports include extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and the Novalung interventional lung assist device (iLA). Successful application of ECLS has led to its more frequent use in general thoracic surgery, especially as a tool to treat hypercapnia and to ensure oxygenation and haemodynamic support. However, these methods are essential in lung transplant programmes; without their help, in most cases, it would not be possible to perform the transplantation or prevent the severe complications associated with critical primary graft dysfunction. Additionally, the extracorporeal circulation also facilitates the performing of specific surgical procedures that would not be feasible under standard conditions or would be associated with an inadequate risk. The application of extracorporeal life supports can fundamentally increase the level of resection when treating advanced intrathoracic malignancies that are in close contact with the heart and large vessels or even directly extend into them. Without the possibility of resecting such structures en bloc, together with the tumour, and, thus, achieving an R0 resection, these malignant tumours are often directly contraindicated for surgery or are operated non-radically, i.e. unsuccessfully. Complete tumour resection is the most important prognostic factor in the surgery.","Lischke, R; Burkert, J",Rozhl Chir,,414

This article examines the potential implications of technology-driven transformations on lower-paid lower-skilled tourism workers. With tourism expected to be the sector most affected by intelligent automation, greater attention needs to be given to the variegated impact on the workforce. Drawing on the concepts of surveillance capitalism, disruptive innovation and techno-solutionism, the article problematises these transformations and unpacks the rhetoric used by tourism and technology companies. Situating the discussion within UN Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG8), the article explores how - without proactive regulatory measures and worker-centric approaches - the expansion of intelligent automation in tourism workplaces risks exacerbating inequalities and precarisation of lower-skilled workers, exposing them to job losses and dislocation, dehumanising their role and gradually automating them out. Additionally, digital surveillance may shift power further towards employers, reducing worker agency and impacting on worker wellbeing. Overall, despite clear benefits, unfettered intelligent automation and digital surveillance risk disrupting established worker rights and protections and inadvertently moving the tourism sector away from the ideals of decent work for all.","Rydzik, A.; Kissoon, C.

We aimed to describe the practice of ventilation management and to establish outcomes in invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19 in a single country during the first month of the outbreak. METHODS: PRoVENT-COVID is a national, multicentre, retrospective observational study done at 18 intensive care units (ICUs) in the Netherlands. Consecutive patients aged at least 18 years were eligible for participation if they had received invasive ventilation for COVID-19 at a participating ICU during the first month of the national outbreak in the Netherlands. The primary outcome was a combination of ventilator variables and parameters over the first 4 calendar days of ventilation: tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), respiratory system compliance, and driving pressure. Secondary outcomes included the use of adjunctive treatments for refractory hypoxaemia and ICU complications. Patient-centred outcomes were ventilator-free days at day 28, duration of ventilation, duration of ICU and hospital stay, and mortality. PRoVENT-COVID is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04346342). FINDINGS: Between March 1 and April 1, 2020, 553 patients were included in the study. Median tidal volume was 6·3 mL/kg predicted bodyweight (IQR 5·7-7·1), PEEP was 14·0 cm H2O (IQR 11·0-15·0), and driving pressure was 14·0 cm H2O (11·2-16·0). Median respiratory system compliance was 31·9 mL/cm H2O (26·0-39·9). Of the adjunctive treatments for refractory hypoxaemia, prone positioning was most often used in the first 4 days of ventilation (283 [53%] of 530 patients). The median number of ventilator-free days at day 28 was 0 (IQR 0-15); 186 (35%) of 530 patients had died by day 28. Predictors of 28-day mortality were gender, age, tidal volume, respiratory system compliance, arterial pH, and heart rate on the first day of invasive ventilation. INTERPRETATION: In patients with COVID-19 who were invasively ventilated during the first month of the outbreak in the Netherlands, lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volume and low driving pressure was broadly applied and prone positioning was often used. The applied PEEP varied widely, despite an invariably low respiratory system compliance. The findings of this national study provide a basis for new hypotheses and sample size calculations for future trials of invasive ventilation for COVID-19. These data could also help in the interpretation of findings from other studies of ventilation practice and outcomes in invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19.

502225,A comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 genomic analysis identifies potential targets for drug repurposing,2021,"Making predictions in a robust way is not easy for nonlinear systems. In this work, a neural network computing framework, i.e., a spatiotemporal convolutional network (STCN), was developed to efficiently and accurately render a multistep-ahead prediction of a time series by employing a spatial-temporal information (STI) transformation. The STCN combines the advantages of both the temporal convolutional network (TCN) and the STI equation, which maps the high-dimensional/spatial data to the future temporal values of a target variable, thus naturally providing the prediction of the target variable. From the observed variables, the STCN also infers the causal factors of the target variable in the sense of Granger causality, which are in turn selected as effective spatial information to improve the prediction robustness. The STCN was successfully applied to both benchmark systems and real-world datasets, all of which show superior and robust performance in multistep-ahead prediction, even when the data were perturbed by noise. From both theoretical and computational viewpoints, the STCN has great potential in practical applications in artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning fields as a model-free method based only on the observed data, and also opens a new way to explore the observed high-dimensional data in a dynamical manner for machine learning.","Peng, Hao; Chen, Pei; Liu, Rui; Chen, Luonan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.01353v1.pdf,414

Much of the debate in previous studies concentrated on whether information outside attentional focus could be consciously experienced and reportable. This study sought to address the debate from a new perspective, through testing whether fully attended supraliminal information is necessarily reportable with a variation of attribute amnesia. Participants were asked to judge the parity of a single number or whether a Chinese character referred to furniture. After several trials, they were unexpectedly asked to report the stimulus identity. The results consistently showed that participants could not correctly report the identity, indicating that fully attended information that was consciously perceived could sometimes overflow report. In addition to providing novel overflow evidence, these findings also have crucial implications in understanding the relationship between consciousness and working memory.","Wang, Rui; Fu, Yingtao; Chen, Luo; Chen, Yutong; Zhou, Jifan; Chen, Hui",Conscious Cogn,,414

In our multicenter study, 543 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were classified as non-severe group and severe group, and then were compared respectively for all-cause mortality and length of hospital stay between those who received corticosteroids and not. By searching in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and CNKI, we identified 13 retrospective studies and 6 random control trials eligible for criteria of inclusion, and conducted comprehensive meta-analyses assessing the impacts of corticosteroids on mortality, length of stay, duration of RNA clearance and duration of fever. Our multicenter study demonstrated that low-dose corticosteroids can reduce mortality in the multivariable Cox regression analysis for severe patients (p = .03), while presented no influence in univariable analysis for non-severe patients (p = .14). From multivariable analyses, patients with corticosteroids in non-severe group had longer duration of hospitalization (p = .003), but did not in severe group (p = .18). Moreover, for severe patients, corticosteroids can evidently shorten duration of fever. The same results were summarized in the meta-analyses supplemented with the result that corticosteroids delayed viral clearing in non-severe patients. Corticosteroids should be considered based on patient's condition. For patients with non-severe COVID-19, corticosteroid was not recommended as a routine therapeutic initiative as that presented prolonged duration of hospitalization and delayed viral clearing, as well as no positive impact on prognosis. While low-dose corticosteroids may benefit patients with severe COVID-19 for it can manifestly lower risk of death and improve the clinical status to some extent.","Zhan, Yuan; Shang, Jin; Gu, Yiya; Huang, Qian; Xie, Jungang",J Med Virol,,414
508225,Inhibitory efficiency of potential drugs against SARS-CoV-2 by blocking human angiotensin converting enzyme-2: Virtual screening and molecular dynamics study,2021,"BACKGROUND: There is growing concern that racial and ethnic minority communities around the world are experiencing a disproportionate burden of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We investigated racial and ethnic disparities in patterns of COVID-19 testing (i.e., who received testing and who tested positive) and subsequent mortality in the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This retrospective cohort study included 5,834,543 individuals receiving care in the US Department of Veterans Affairs; most (91%) were men, 74% were non-Hispanic White (White), 19% were non-Hispanic Black (Black), and 7% were Hispanic. We evaluated associations between race/ethnicity and receipt of COVID-19 testing, a positive test result, and 30-day mortality, with multivariable adjustment for a wide range of demographic and clinical characteristics including comorbid conditions, health behaviors, medication history, site of care, and urban versus rural residence. Between February 8 and July 22, 2020, 254,595 individuals were tested for COVID-19, of whom 16,317 tested positive and 1,057 died. Black individuals were more likely to be tested (rate per 1,000 individuals: 60.0, 95% CI 59.6-60.5) than Hispanic (52.7, 95% CI 52.1-53.4) and White individuals (38.6, 95% CI 38.4-38.7). While individuals from minority backgrounds were more likely to test positive (Black versus White: odds ratio [OR] 1.93, 95% CI 1.85-2.01, p < 0.001; Hispanic versus White: OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.74-1.94, p < 0.001), 30-day mortality did not differ by race/ethnicity (Black versus White: OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80-1.17, p = 0.74; Hispanic versus White: OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.73-1.34, p = 0.94). The disparity between Black and White individuals in testing positive for COVID-19 was stronger in the Midwest (OR 2.66, 95% CI 2.41-2.95, p < 0.001) than the West (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11-1.39, p < 0.001). The disparity in testing positive for COVID-19 between Hispanic and White individuals was consistent across region, calendar time, and outbreak pattern. Study limitations include underrepresentation of women and a lack of detailed information on social determinants of health. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide study, we found that Black and Hispanic individuals are experiencing an excess burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection not entirely explained by underlying medical conditions or where they live or receive care. There is an urgent need to proactively tailor strategies to contain and prevent further outbreaks in racial and ethnic minority communities.","Rentsch, Christopher T; Kidwai-Khan, Farah; Tate, Janet P; Park, Lesley S; King, Joseph T; Skanderson, Melissa; Hauser, Ronald G; Schultze, Anna; Jarvis, Christopher I; Holodniy, Mark; Lo Re, Vincent; Akgün, Kathleen M; Crothers, Kristina; Taddei, Tamar H; Freiberg, Matthew S; Justice, Amy C",PLoS Med,,414

Methods: This cross-sectional hospital-based study included 7,008 tele-consultations presenting between March 23rd and April 19th 2020. A three-level protocol was implemented to triage the calls. The data of patient queries were collected using a Google Form/Sheets and the tele-calls were returned using the patient information retrieved from the electronic medical record system. Results: Overall, 7,008 tele-calls were addressed, of which 2,805 (40.02%) patients where a clinical-related query was answered were included for analysis. The most common queries were related to redness/pain/watering/blurring of vision (31.52%), closely followed by usage of medications (31.05%). The majority of the queries were directed to the department of cornea (34.15%), followed by retina (24.74%). Less than one-fifth of the patients were from the lower socio-economic class (16.08%) and one-fourth were new patients (23.96%). The most common advice given to the patient was related to management of medications (54.15%) followed by appointment related (17.79%). Emergency requests requiring further evaluation by an ophthalmologist accounted for a small percentage (16.36%) of patients. Conclusion: Tracking of tele-consultations and access to patient information from the electronic medical records enabled a timely response in an ongoing lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The current experience provided valuable insights to the possibility of managing patient follow-up visits remotely in the future.","Das, Anthony V; Rani, Padmaja K; Vaddavalli, Pravin K",Indian J Ophthalmol,,414

The respiratory tract is the main route of transmission of the virus, and the majority of symptoms are respiratory relative. Until now, there has been no reports concerning the nervous system onset. We present a 2019-nCoV patient with the onset of simple dizziness, accompanied by dry throat, no fever, no cough, no headache, no mental abnormality, and no obvious abnormality in the nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head. Meanwhile, chest computed tomography (CT) scans showed multiple small spot shadows and interstitial changes in the early stage, especially in the extrapulmonary zone. There was a development of multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltrative shadows in both lungs with mild pleural effusion. The nucleic acid gene detection was positive, and thus the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV was confirmed. At last, the prognosis was good after active treatment. After antiviral and anti-infective treatment, the symptoms recovered. We presume that 2019-nCoV can also manifest in the nervous system alone, and lung CT, which has relative specificity, should be used as a routine screening method.","Kong, Zhaohong; Wang, Jingwei; Li, Tao; Zhang, Zhaohui; Jian, Jiang",Ann.

Genetic and pharmacologic studies have previously established a pathologic role for ATX and LPA signalling in pulmonary injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. Here, increased ENPP2 mRNA levels were detected in immune cells from nasopharyngeal swab samples of COVID-19 patients, and increased ATX serum levels were found in severe COVID-19 patients. ATX serum levels correlated with the corresponding increased serum levels of IL-6 and endothelial damage biomarkers, suggesting an interplay of the ATX/LPA axis with hyperinflammation and the associated vascular dysfunction in COVID-19. Accordingly, dexamethasone (Dex) treatment of mechanically ventilated patients reduced ATX levels, as shown in two independent cohorts, indicating that the therapeutic benefits of Dex include the suppression of ATX. Moreover, large scale analysis of multiple single cell RNAseq datasets revealed the expression landscape of ENPP2 in COVID-19 and further suggested a role for ATX in the homeostasis of dendritic cells, that exhibit both numerical and functional deficits in COVID-19. Therefore, ATX has likely a multifunctional role in COVID-19 pathogenesis, worth of suggesting that its pharmacological targeting might represent an additional therapeutic option.","Nikitopoulou, Ioanna; Fanidis, Dionysios; Ntatsoulis, Konstantinos; Moulos, Panagiotis; Mpekoulis, George; Evangelidou, Maria; Dimakopoulou, Vasiliki; Vassiliou, Alice G; Jahaj, Edison; Tsipilis, Stamatios; Orfanos, Stylianos E; Dimopoulou, Ioanna; Angelakis, Emmanouil; Akinosoglou, Karolina; Vassilaki, Niki; Tzouvelekis, Argyris; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Aidinis, Vassilis",,,414

512101,SARS-CoV-2 mutations acquired in mink reduce antibody-mediated neutralization,2021,"COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) was recently reported as a potential infective complication affecting critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome following SARS-CoV-2 infection, with incidence rates varying from 8 to 33% depending on the study. However, definitive diagnosis of CAPA is challenging. Standardised diagnostic algorithms and definitions are lacking, clinicians are reticent to perform aerosol-generating bronchoalveolar lavages for galactomannan testing and microscopic and cultural examination, and questions surround the diagnostic sensitivity of different serum biomarkers. Between 11th March and 14th July 2020, the UK National Mycology Reference Laboratory received 1267 serum and respiratory samples from 719 critically ill UK patients with COVID-19 and suspected pulmonary aspergillosis. The laboratory also received 46 isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus from COVID-19 patients (including three that exhibited environmental triazole resistance). Diagnostic tests performed included 1000 (1-3)-ß-d-glucan and 516 galactomannan tests on serum samples. The results of this extensive testing are presented here. For a subset of 61 patients, respiratory specimens (bronchoalveolar lavages, tracheal aspirates, sputum samples) in addition to serum samples were submitted and subjected to galactomannan testing, Aspergillus-specific PCR and microscopy and culture. The incidence of probable/proven and possible CAPA in this subset of patients was approximately 5% and 15%, respectively. Overall, our results highlight the challenges in biomarker-driven diagnosis of CAPA especially when only limited clinical samples are available for testing, and the importance of a multi-modal diagnostic approach involving regular and repeat testing of both serum and respiratory samples.","Borman, Andrew M; Palmer, Michael D; Fraser, Mark; Patterson, Zoe; Mann, Ciara; Oliver, Debra; Linton, Christopher J; Gough, Martin; Brown, Phillipa; Dzietczyk, Agnieszka; Hedley, Michelle; McLachlan, Sue; King, Julie; Johnson, Elizabeth M",J. clin. microbiol,,414
512102,SARS-CoV-2 mutations acquired in mink reduce antibody-mediated neutralization,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has reached 40 million confirmed cases worldwide. Given its rapid progression, it is important to examine its origins to better understand how people's knowledge, attitudes, and reactions have evolved over time. One method is to use data mining of social media conversations related to information exposure and self-reported user experiences. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to characterize the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of social media users located at the initial epicenter of the outbreak by analyzing data from the Sina Weibo platform in Chinese. METHODS: We used web scraping to collect public Weibo posts from December 31, 2019, to January 20, 2020, from users located in Wuhan City that contained COVID-19-related keywords. We then manually annotated all posts using an inductive content coding approach to identify specific information sources and key themes including news and knowledge about the outbreak, public sentiment, and public reaction to control and response measures. RESULTS: We identified 10,159 COVID-19 posts from 8703 unique Weibo users. Among our three parent classification areas, 67.22% (n=6829) included news and knowledge posts, 69.72% (n=7083) included public sentiment, and 47.87% (n=4863) included public reaction and self-reported behavior. Many of these themes were expressed concurrently in the same Weibo post. Subtopics for news and knowledge posts followed four distinct timelines and evidenced an escalation of the outbreak's seriousness as more information became available. Public sentiment primarily focused on expressions of anxiety, though some expressions of anger and even positive sentiment were also detected. Public reaction included both protective and elevated health risk behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Between the announcement of pneumonia and respiratory illness of unknown origin in late December 2019 and the discovery of human-to-human transmission on January 20, 2020, we observed a high volume of public anxiety and confusion about COVID-19, including different reactions to the news by users, negative sentiment after being exposed to information, and public reaction that translated to self-reported behavior. These findings provide early insight into changing knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors about COVID-19, and have the potential to inform future outbreak communication, response, and policy making in China and beyond.","Xu, Qing; Shen, Ziyi; Shah, Neal; Cuomo, Raphael; Cai, Mingxiang; Brown, Matthew; Li, Jiawei; Mackey, Tim",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,414

These numbers are still rising daily. Most (some 80%) cases of COVID­19 infection are asymptomatic, a substantial number of cases (15%) require hospitalization and an additional fraction of patients (5%) need recovery in intensive care units. Mortality for COVID­19 infection appears to occur globally between 0.1 and 0.5% of infected patients although the frequency of lethality is significantly augmented in the elderly and in patients with other comorbidities. The development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and episodes of thromboembolism that may lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) represent the primary causes of lethality during COVID­19 infection. Increasing evidence suggests that thrombotic diathesis is due to multiple derangements of the coagulation system including marked elevation of D­dimer that correlate negatively with survival. We propose here that the thromboembolic events and eventually the development of DIC provoked by SARS­CoV­2 infection may represent a secondary anti­phospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). We will apply both Baconian inductivism and Cartesian deductivism to prove that secondary APS is likely responsible for coagulopathy during the course of COVID­19 infection.

A CT of the thorax showed a pneumomediastinum. The HFNC was temporally interrupted, since it was uncertain whether the positive end-expiratory pressure of the HFNC could be the cause of the pneumomediastinum. After restart of the HFNC, there was no increase of symptoms. We suggest that the pneumomediastinum was the result of COVID-19-related alveolar damage, and not due to the use of HFNC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 187 patients with COVID-19 treated at Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College from February 15, 2020, to February 29, 2020. Demographic data, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and based on the clinical classification of severity, patients were divided into groups 1 (mild) and 2 (severe/critical). A semiquantitative visual score was used to estimate the lesion extent. A three-dimensional slicer was used to precisely quantify the volume and CT value of the lung and lesions. Correlation coefficients of the quantitative CT parameters, semiquantitative visual score, and clinical classification were calculated using Spearman's correlation. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to compare the accuracies of quantitative and semi-quantitative methods. RESULTS: There were 59 patients in group 1 and 128 patients in group 2. The mean age and sex distribution of the two groups were not significantly different. The lesions were primarily located in the subpleural area. Compared to group 1, group 2 had larger values for all volume-dependent parameters (p < 0.001). The percentage of lesions had the strongest correlation with disease severity with a correlation coefficient of 0.495. In comparison, the correlation coefficient of semiquantitative score was 0.349. To classify the severity of COVID-19, area under the curve of the percentage of lesions was the highest (0.807; 95% confidence interval, 0.744-0.861: p < 0.001) and that of the quantitative CT parameters was significantly higher than that of the semiquantitative visual score (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The classification accuracy of quantitative CT parameters was significantly superior to that of semiquantitative visual score in terms of evaluating the severity of COVID-19.","Yin, Xi; Min, Xiangde; Nan, Yan; Feng, Zhaoyan; Li, Basen; Cai, Wei; Xi, Xiaoqing; Wang, Liang",Korean j. radiol,,414

Identification of a strategy to manage the severity of this disease will not only help to reduce its case fatality but also help to remove some of the burden from the already overwhelmed health care systems. While successful management of symptoms in general is important, identifying measures to modify the severity of the illness is a key factor in the fight against this pandemic. METHODS: This paper presents a short literature review to suggest a new treatment modality for COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 is less severe and rarely fatal in children than in adults, which could be caused by greater fluctuations of plasma epinephrine in children. Our literature survey endorses this hypothesis according to both the epidemiological and immunological findings.

This study aimed to calculate the transmissibility of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to evaluate the effectiveness of measures to control the disease in Jilin Province, China. METHODS: The data of reported COVID-19 cases were collected, including imported and local cases from Jilin Province as of March 14, 2019. A Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Asymptomatic-Recovered/Removed (SEIAR) model was developed to fit the data, and the effective reproduction number (Reff) was calculated at different stages in the province. Finally, the effectiveness of the measures was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 97 COVID-19 infections were reported in Jilin Province, among which 45 were imported infections (including one asymptomatic infection) and 52 were local infections (including three asymptomatic infections). The model fit the reported data well (R2 = 0.593, P < 0.001). The Reff of COVID-19 before and after February 1, 2020 was 1.64 and 0.05, respectively. Without the intervention taken on February 1, 2020, the predicted cases would have reached a peak of 177,011 on October 22, 2020 (284 days from the first case). The projected number of cases until the end of the outbreak (on October 9, 2021) would have been 17,129,367, with a total attack rate of 63.66%. Based on the comparison between the predicted incidence of the model and the actual incidence, the comprehensive intervention measures implemented in Jilin Province on February 1 reduced the incidence of cases by 99.99%. Therefore, according to the current measures and implementation efforts, Jilin Province can achieve good control of the virus's spread.

DESIGN: This pragmatic trial compares an asynchronous form of CBT-CP that uses interactive voice response (IVR) to allow patients to participate from their home (IVR CBT-CP) with synchronous CBT-CP delivered by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) clinician. Veterans (n=764; 50% male) with chronic musculoskeletal pain throughout nine VA medical centers will participate. The primary outcome is pain interference after treatment (4 months). Secondary outcomes, including pain intensity, depression symptom severity, sleep, self-efficacy, and global impression of change, are also measured after treatment. Where possible, outcomes are collected via electronic health record extraction, with remaining measures collected via IVR calls to maintain blinding. Quantitative and qualitative process evaluation metrics will be collected to evaluate factors related to implementation. A budget impact analysis will be performed. SUMMARY: This pragmatic trial compares the outcomes, cost, and implementation of two forms of CBT-CP as delivered in the real-world setting. Findings from the trial can be used to guide future policy and implementation efforts related to these interventions and their use in the health system.

Although mass-vaccination sites have been identified as essential to curb COVID-19, their organization and functioning is challenging. In this paper we present the planning, implementation and evalua-tion of a massive vaccination center in Lombardy - the largest Region in Italy and the most heavily hit by the pandemic. The massive hub of Novegro (Milan), managed by the Gruppo Ospedaliero San Donato, opened in April 2021. The Novegro mass-immunization model was developed building a la-yout based on the available scientific evidence, on comparative analysis with other existing models and on the experience of COVID-19 immunization delivery of Gruppo Ospedaliero San Donato. We propose a ""vaccine islands"" mass-immunization model, where 4 physicians and 2 nurses operate in each island, with up to 10 islands functioning at the same time, with the capacity of providing up to 6,000 vaccinations per day. During the first week of activity a total of 37,900 doses were administered (2,700/day), most of them with Pfizer vaccine (85.8%) and first doses (70.9%). The productivity was 10.5 vaccines/hour/vaccine station. Quality, efficiency and safety were boosted by ad-hoc personnel training, quality technical infrastructure and the presence of a shock room. Constant process monitoring allowed to identify and promptly tackle process pitfalls, including vaccine refusals (0.36%, below expectations) and post-vaccinations adverse reactions (0.4%). Our innovative ""vaccine islands"" mass-immunization model might be scaled-up or adapted to other settings. The Authors consider that sharing best practices in immunization delivery is fundamen-tal to achieve population health during health emergencies.","Signorelli, C; Odone, A; Gianfredi, V; Capraro, M; Kacerik, E; Chiecca, G; Scardoni, A; Minerva, M; Mantecca, R; Musarò, P; Brazzoli, P; Basteri, P; Bertini, B; Esposti, F; Ferri, C; Alberti, V A; Gastaldi, G",Ann Ig,,414
522778,Mapping the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-derived peptidome presented by HLA class II on dendritic cells,2021,"COVID-19 has greatly affected the tourist industry and ways of travel. According to the UNTWO predictions, the number of international tourist arrivals will be slowly growing by the end of 2021. One of the ways to keep tourists safe during travel is to use a personal car or car-sharing service. The sensor-based information collected from the tourist’s smartphone during the trip allows his/her behaviour analysis. For this purpose, we propose to use the Internet of Things with ambient intelligence technologies, which allows information processing using the surrounding devices. The paper describes a solution to the car tourist trajectory prediction, which has been the demanding subject of different research studies in recent years. We present an approach based on the usage of the bidirectional LSTM neural network model. We show the reference model of the tourist support system for car-based attraction-visiting trips. The sensor data acquisition process and the bidirectional LSTM model construction, training and evaluation are demonstrated. We propose a system architecture that uses the tourist’s smartphone for data acquisition as well as more powerful surrounding devices for information processing. The obtained results can be used for tourist trip behaviour analysis. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Mikhailov, S.; Kashevnik, A.",Electronics (Switzerland),,414
589833,Development of a pseudovirus based assay for measuring neutralizing antibodies against coxsackievirus B5,2017-04-20,"BACKGROUND: There has been an intense debate in the Brazilian National Congress on how to reform the country's tax system on consumption. This paper investigates the effects of the tax reform under the Constitutional Amendment Bill 45/2019 on cigarette prices, consumption and tax collection. The reform will introduce a new goods and services tax (GST) and tobacco excise tax (TET). METHODS: The micro data from the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) of 2008 and the National Health Survey (PNS) of 2013 are inputs in the simulation in order to determine the smoking behaviour and consumer responses to price changes as accurately as possible across the different Brazilian states. We developed three scenarios for the tobacco tax reform and their effects on cigarette prices, smoking behaviour and tax collection. We also estimate the size of the illicit cigarette market by Brazilian state and simulate the impacts of a 10% reduction in its market share. FINDINGS: Overall, we found that a GST of 27% and a TET of either 51%, 56% or specific 3.89 BRL per pack would lead to considerably higher cigarette prices, lower cigarette consumption and, above all, an increase of cigarette tax collection between 8% and 27% depending on the state. A discretionary 10% reduction in the illicit market would add about 8.5% of extra tax collection per year to the country. CONCLUSIONS: The simulated scenarios demonstrated that, to keep the cigarette prices at least at the same level as those in the current tax scheme, TET should be no less than 77.85% of the retail price. This means that any politically feasible tax reform should result in higher cigarette prices and a reduction in cigarette consumption. Considering the nationwide effect, in all scenarios, the total increase in tobacco tax revenue is around 8.5% or 1.5 billion BRL per year. This extra revenue is highly desirable in an environment of chronic fiscal imbalance and the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.","Divino, Jose Angelo; Ehrl, Philipp; Candido, Osvaldo; Valadao, Marcos Aurelio Pereira",Tob. control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34526409/; https://doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2021-056822,414

Additionally, decreased social control may have led to a lower detection rate of child protection cases. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to better understand the impact of the lockdown in Germany on the frequency and severity of child abuse and neglect. To do so the quantity and quality of cases of suspected child abuse and neglect in German pediatric departments and outpatient departments for medical child protection were examined. METHODS: In May 2020 a total of 343 institutions of medical child protection were invited to fill in a questionnaire with items describing their institution and items depicting cases of child protection in March and April 2019 and 2020 regarding age, form and severity of abuse as well as items to describe particular remarks and ideas for child protection during the pandemic. RESULTS: Out of the 343 pediatric departments and outpatient departments of medical child protection invited, the participation rate was 46%. In this study 81 institutions reported the total cases of suspected child abuse or neglect for both March and April 2019 and 2020. The number of cases dropped from 454 to 387 (−15%) in outpatient child abuse clinics and from 307 to 246 (−20%) in pediatric inpatient departments. Regarding the age of affected children and the form of abuse no significant differences were found. CONCLUSION: The study found a decrease in reported cases of suspected child abuse and neglect during the lockdown in March and April 2020 compared to 2019. While the results do not show an increase of total child abuse and neglect, as suspected by many professionals, the decrease in reported cases may be explained by a steep increase in unreported cases due to reduced social control.","Heimann, T.; Ewert, J.; Metzner, F.; Sigmund, F.; Jud, A.; Pawils, S.",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00112-021-01135-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33612861/,414

Kanglaite injections (KLTi) have been widely used for the treatment of cancer in China. KLTi combined with chemotherapy could improve the short-term efficacy, quality of life, and performance status for NSCLC compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial aims to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of KLTi in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. METHODS: This will be an investigator-initiated multicenter open-label randomized controlled trial. We will randomly assign 334 eligible participants with stage IIIA-IV NSCLC to the treatment or control groups in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in both groups will be administered 4–6 cycles of first-line platinum-based double chemotherapy regimens. Patients with complete response, partial response, or stable disease after 4–6 cycles will receive non-platinum single-agent chemotherapy. Patients in the treatment group are to receive intravenous KLTi 200 ml per day continuously for 14 days, commencing on the first day of chemotherapy. The treatment will be discontinued at the time of disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity is noted. The follow-up will be conducted every 2 months until death, loss of follow-up, or 12 months from randomized enrollment. The primary outcome will be progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary outcomes will be the objective response rate, 1-year survival rate, quality of life, living ability, and blood lipids. The safety outcome will be the rate of adverse events. DISCUSSION: This study will be the first randomized controlled trial in which PFS is used as the primary outcome to test whether KLTi combined with first-line chemotherapy has superior efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to chemotherapy alone in advanced NSCLC. This will also be the first clinical study to observe the effects of KLTi on blood lipids. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03986528.

While most patients experience only mild symptoms, a relevant proportion develop severe disease progression with increasing hypoxia up to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The substantial number of patients with severe disease have strained intensive care capacities to an unprecedented level. Owing to the highly variable course and lack of reliable predictors for deterioration, we aimed to identify variables that allow the prediction of patients with a high risk of respiratory failure and need of mechanical ventilation Patients with PCR proven symptomatic COVID-19 infection hospitalized at our institution from 29th February to 27th March 2020 (n=40) were analyzed for baseline clinical and laboratory findings. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation 13/40 (32.5%) did not differ in age, comorbidities, radiological findings, respiratory rate or qSofa score. However, elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) was strongly associated with the need for mechanical ventilation (p=1.2.10-5). In addition, the maximal IL-6 level (cutoff 80 pg/ml) for each patient during disease predicted respiratory failure with high accuracy (p=1.7.10-8, AUC=0.98). The risk of respiratory failure for patients with IL-6 levels of ≥ 80 pg/ml was 22 times higher compared to patients with lower IL-6 levels. In the current situation with overwhelmed intensive care units and overcrowded emergency rooms, correct triage of patients in need of intensive care is crucial.

However, their consequences in terms of mental well-being might be negative, especially for older adults. While existing studies mainly focus on the time during the first lockdown, we look at the weeks afterward in order to measure the medium-term consequences of the first wave of the pandemic. Using data from the SHARE Corona Survey, we include retired respondents aged 60 and above from 25 European countries plus Israel. Combining SHARE data with macro-data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker allows us to include macro-indicators at the country level, namely the number of deaths per 100,000 and the number of days with stringent epidemic control measures, in addition to individual characteristics. The findings show that both macro-indicators are influential for increased feelings of sadness/depression, but that individual factors are crucial for explaining increased feelings of loneliness in the time after the first lockdown. Models with interaction terms reveal that the included macro-indicators have negative well-being consequences, particularly for the oldest survey participants. Additionally, the results reveal that especially those living alone had a higher risk for increased loneliness in the time after the first COVID-19 wave.

Critical determinants of the viral dynamics and host response, including type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells, interferons, chemokines, toxins and innate immune cells, are included. We estimate model parameters, compute the within-host basic reproductive number, and study the impacts of therapies, prophylactics, and host/pathogen variability on the course of the infection. Model simulations indicate that the innate immune response suppresses the infection and enables the alveolar epithelium to partially recover. While very robust antiviral therapy controls the infection and enables the epithelium to heal, moderate therapy is of limited benefit. Meanwhile interferon therapy is predicted to reduce viral load but exacerbate tissue damage. The deleterious effects of interferon therapy are especially apparent late in the infection. Individual variation in ACE2 expression, epithelial cell interferon production, and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding affinity are predicted to significantly impact prognosis.","Leander, R.

Our findings will help to optimize shift work scheduling, use the existing nursing workforce more efficiently, and improve nursing quality. BACKGROUND: Nurses are one of the main professionals fighting against COVID‐19. Providing care for COVID‐19 patients is challenging. In isolation wards, the workload has increased, and the workflow and shift patterns are completely different from the usual. More importantly, there is a shortage of nurses. Therefore, it is essential and urgent to arrange nurses’ shifts correctly and use the existing workforce resources efficiently. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study of 14 nurses in Chinese hospitals was conducted. METHODS: Semi‐structured interviews were used based on the phenomenological research method; data was analyzed using Colaizzi’s method of data analysis. This study aligns with the COREQ checklist. RESULTS: Four themes were extracted: assess the competency of nurses to assign nursing work scientifically and reasonably, reorganize nursing workflow to optimize shift patterns, communicate between managers and front‐line nurses to humanize shift patterns, and nurses’ various feelings and views on shift patterns. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to arrange shift patterns scientifically and allocate workforce rationally to optimize nursing workforce allocation, reduce nurses’ workload, improve nursing quality, and promote physical and mental health among nurses during the COVID‐19 pandemic. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study emphasized nurses’ experiences on shift patterns in isolation wards, providing useful information to manage shift patterns.

These viruses have a potential and tendency to cross-species barriers and infect humans. Novel human coronavirus 2019-nCoV (hCoV-19) emerged from Wuhan, China, and has caused a global pandemic. Genomic features of SARS-CoV-2 may attribute inter-species transmission and adaptation to a novel host, and therefore is imperative to explicate the evolutionary dynamics of the viral genome and its propensity for differential host selection. We conducted an in silico analysis of all the coding gene sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains (n = 39) originating from a range of non-human mammalian species, including pangolin, bat, dog, cat, tiger, mink, mouse, and the environmental samples such as wastewater, air and surface samples from the door handle and seafood market. Compared to the reference SARS-CoV-2 strain (MN908947; Wuhan-Hu-1), phylogenetic and comparative residue analysis revealed the circulation of three variants, including hCoV-19 virus from humans and two hCoV-19-related precursors from bats and pangolins. A lack of obvious differences as well as a maximum genetic homology among dog-, cat-, tiger-, mink-, mouse-, bat- and pangolin-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences suggested a likely evolution of these strains from a common ancestor. Several residue substitutions were observed in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, concluding a promiscuous nature of the virus for host species where genomic alternations may be required for the adaptation to novel host/s. However, such speculation needs in vitro investigations to unleash the influence of substitutions towards species-jump and disease pathogenesis.

A survey was developed and distributed, with results showing that methods were rapidly applied to conduct SARS-CoV-2 WBE, primarily to test wastewater influent from large urban wastewater treatment plants. Additionally, most methods utilized small wastewater volumes and the primary concentration methods used were polyethylene glycol precipitation, membrane filtration and centrifugal ultrafiltration followed by nucleic acid extraction and assay for primarily nucleocapsid gene targets (N1, N2, and/or N3). Since this survey was performed, many laboratories have continued to optimize and implement a variety of methods for SARS-CoV-2 WBE.

The sudden need to shift revealed emerging challenges to online teaching, both logistic and personal. One important challenge is the ability to assess the readiness of educators for online teaching, so that appropriate and specific feedback/training can be offered to those in need. This study aims at developing, validating, and implementing a tool to measure the teachers’ readiness for online teaching in three medical schools from three different countries. METHODS: This was a multi-center, cross-sectional study that involved developing a survey through review of literature and previous studies, item development and revision, and pilot testing. The survey was then distributed electronically to a convenient sample of 217 teaching faculty members of different academic ranks from three medical schools in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain. Exploratory factor analysis and reliability study were performed. Descriptive statistics were applied, and the statistical significance level was set at 0.05. RESULTS: Factor analysis produced the following five factors: “Online Teaching and Course Design Skills”, “Digital Communication”, “Basic Computer Skills”, “Advanced Computer Skills” and “Using Learning Management Systems”. The tool showed high reliability (alpha = 0.94). Survey results showed highest mean scores for Basic Computer Skills with lower scores for Online Teaching and Course Design Skills and Using Learning Management Systems. ANOVA revealed statistically significant differences between the three studied schools regarding Digital Communication (F=5.13; p=0.007) and Basic Computer Skills (F=4.47; p=0.012) factors. CONCLUSION: The tool proved to be reliable and valid.

596899,A Multiscale Coarse-grained Model of the SARS-CoV-2 Virion,2020-10-02,"The outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 responsible for COVID-19 pandemic has caused worldwide public health emergency. Due to the constantly evolving nature of the coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 mediated alteration on post-transcriptional gene regulation across human tissues remains elusive. In this study, we systematically dissected the crosstalk and dysregulation of human post-transcriptional regulatory networks governed by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and micro-RNAs (miRs), due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We uncovered that 13 out of 29 SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins directly interact with 51 human RBPs of which majority of them were abundantly expressed in gonadal tissues and immune cells. We further performed functional analysis of differentially expressed genes in mock treated versus SARS-CoV-2 infected lung cells that revealed an enrichment for immune response, cytokine mediated signaling, and metabolism associated genes. This study also characterized the alternative splicing events in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells compared to control demonstrating that skipped exons and mutually exclusive exons were the most abundant events that potentially contributed to differential outcomes in response to viral infection. Motif enrichment analysis on the RNA genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 clearly revealed an enrichment for RBPs such as SRSFs, PCBPs, ELAVs and HNRNPs illustrating the sponging of RBPs by SARS-CoV-2 genome. Similar analysis to study the interactions of miRs with SARS-CoV-2 revealed the potential for several miRs to be sponged, suggesting that these interactions may contribute to altered pos-transcriptional regulation across human tissues. Given the need to understand the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with key pos-transcriptional regulators in the human genome, this study provides a systematic analysis to dissect the role of dysregulated post-transcriptional regulatory networks controlled by RBPs and miRs, across tissues types during SARS-CoV2 infection.","Srivastava, Rajneesh; Daulatabad, Swapna Vidhur; Srivastava, Mansi; Janga, Sarath Chandra",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.06.190348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32676599/,414

This computation only requires the knowledge of the serial interval. The ERN estimate is made through the minimization of a functional that includes: (i) the adjustment of the incidence curve using an epidemiological model, (ii) the regularity of the estimation of the ERN and, (iii) the adjustment of the initial value to an initial estimate of R_0 obtained from the initial exponential growth of the epidemic. The model does not assume any statistical distribution for the ERN and, more importantly, does not require truncating the serial interval when its distribution contains negative days. A comparative study has been carried out with the standard EpiEstim method. For a particular choice of the parameters of the variational model and of the serial interval, a good agreement has been obtained between the estimate provided by the variational model and a 7 days shifted estimate obtained by EpiEstim. This backward shift suggests that our estimate is closer to present than that of EpiEstim. We also examine how to forecast the value of the ERN and the number of infected in the short term by two different extrapolation techniques.

Both methods resulted in the same grouping data. So the grouping method based on HVR 1 could represent the grouping method based on the whole S1 gene. Taiwan isolates could not be placed within the existing groups. In order to test the correlation between genotype and serotype, a one-way neutralization test was used to compare 9 Taiwan isolates selected from different genotypes with Massachusetts (Mass) (H120) and Connecticut (Conn) standard strains. In addition, a two-way cross-neutralization test was performed in embryonated eggs with the β method (constant-virus, diluted-serum) and the reciprocal neutralization titers were calculated to give the relatedness (r) values. The results of two kinds of neutralizing tests showed that the serotypes of 9 isolates were different from Mass or Conn. Based on the r-values, 9 isolates were divided into two serotypes which were correlated with their genotypes. From pathogenicity tests, IBV Taiwan isolates could be divided into high, intermediate, and low pathogenicity according to their pathogenicity indexes. However, no relationship exists between pathotype and genotype. In conclusion, the genetic typing method based on HVR 1 can be used for typing IBV isolates.","Wang, C. -H.; Huang, Y. -C.",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10752554/,414
597806,Therapeutic potential of miRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor ACE2,2020-11-18,"In addition to neuraminidase inhibitors and other drugs that directly target viral replication, a number of adjunctive and immunomodulatory therapies are currently under evaluation for the treatment of influenza. These novel treatments, which focus either on pathophysiological aspects of influenza virus infection or the neutralization of virus with antibodies, are the subject of this review. Cytokine dysregulation has been observed in patients with severe influenza, such as avian influenza A (H5N1) and pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1pdm09) virus infections, but the role of immunomodulatory therapy is unclear, due to lack of data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Convalescent plasma appears to be useful as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of H5N1 and H1N1pdm09 infections. Until lately, data interpretation was limited to case reports and studies of non-randomized design, but a recent RCT found that patients with severe influenza A (H1N1pdm09) who were treated with hyperimmune immunoglobulin from persons who had survived the same disease had a lower peak viral load and lower mortality than controls, providing treatment was begun within 5 days of symptom onset. The efficacy of agents with potential immunomodulating effects, including intravenous immunoglobulin, N-acetylcysteine, acute use of statins, macrolides, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors agonists, celecoxib and mesalazine, and the role of plasmapheresis and hemoperfusion as rescue therapy, deserve more investigation and where feasible, studies by RCTs.

To contain the transmission of this virus, the Swiss Federal Council ordered a nationwide lockdown of all nonessential businesses. Accordingly, students and employees of institutions for higher education were informed to continue their academic programs through home-office settings and online lectures. OBJECTIVE: This longitudinal survey aims to evaluate various lifestyle habits such as physical activity, nutritional habits, and sleep behavior among students and employees of a Swiss University of Applied Sciences during a 2-month period of confinement and social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic and 1 year thereafter. METHODS: This paper describes a protocol for a retrospective and prospective observational cohort study. Students and employees of Bern University of Applied Sciences, Department of Health Professions, were invited to anonymously complete a web-based survey during the COVID-19 confinement period. This will be followed by a second survey, scheduled 1 year after the lockdown. Information on various lifestyle aspects, including physical activity, nutritional habits, and sleep behavior, will be collected using adaptations of existing validated questionnaires. RESULTS: This longitudinal study started during the government-ordered confinement period in Switzerland in mid-April 2020 and will end in mid-2021.

The spectrum of interferon (IFN)-γ responses of Balb/c mice immunized against two different forms of SARS CoV-N plasmid was then analyzed. A cluster of dominant T-cell epitopes of SARS CoV-N protein was found in the N-terminus (amino acids 76–114). On the basis of this study, four different plasmids were constructed: (i) DNA encoding the unmodified N (p-N) or N(70−122) (p-N(70−122)) as an endogenous cytoplasmic protein or (ii) DNA encoding a lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP) chimera with N (p-LAMP/N) or N(70−122) (p-LAMP/N(70−122)). The immune responses of mice to these four constructs were evaluated. The results showed marked differences in the responses of the immunized mice. A single priming immunization with the p-LAMP/N construct was sufficient to elicit an antibody response. Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay indicated that p-LAMP/N(70−122) and p-LAMP/N plasmids both elicited a greater IFN-γ response than p-N. p-N and p-N(70−122) constructs induced low or undetectable levels of cytokine secretion. We also found that the p-LAMP/N(70−122) construct promoted a long-lasting T-cell memory response without an additional boost 6 months after three immunizations. These findings show that DNA vaccines, even epitope-based DNA vaccines using LAMP as chimera, can elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses.","Yang, K; Sun, K; Srinivasan, K N; Salmon, J; Marques, E T; Xu, J; August, J T",Gene Ther,https://doi.org/10.1038/gt.2009.92; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19727132/,414

METHODS: We investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in its early weeks on mental health care and mental health service users in the UK using a mixed methods online survey. Recruitment channels included professional associations and networks, charities, and social media. Quantitative findings were reported with descriptive statistics, and content analysis conducted for qualitative data. RESULTS: 2,180 staff from a range of sectors, professions, and specialties participated. Immediate infection control concerns were highly salient for inpatient staff, new ways of working for community staff. Multiple rapid adaptations and innovations in response to the crisis were described, especially remote working. This was cautiously welcomed but found successful in only some clinical situations. Staff had specific concerns about many groups of service users, including people whose conditions are exacerbated by pandemic anxieties and social disruptions; people experiencing loneliness, domestic abuse and family conflict; those unable to understand and follow social distancing requirements; and those who cannot engage with remote care. CONCLUSION: This overview of staff concerns and experiences in the early COVID-19 pandemic suggests directions for further research and service development: we suggest that how to combine infection control and a therapeutic environment in hospital, and how to achieve effective and targeted tele-health implementation in the community, should be priorities.

His hypothesis described polymers as macromolecules composed of large numbers of structural units connected by covalent bonds. In the 1990s the concept of supramolecular polymers emerged in the scientific literature as discrete entities of large molar mass comparable to that of classical polymers but built through non-covalent bonds among monomers. Supramolecular polymers exist in biological systems, and potentially blend the physical properties of covalent polymers with unique features such as high degrees of internal order within the polymeric structure, defined shapes, and novel dynamics. This trend article provides a summary of seminal contributions in supramolecular polymerization and provides recent examples from the Stupp laboratory to demonstrate the potential applications of an exciting class of materials composed fully or partially of supramolecular polymers.

600090,"A Genome Sequence of Novel SARS-CoV Isolates: the Genotype, GD-Ins29, Leads to a Hypothesis of Viral Transmission in South China",2016-11-28,"Background/Aims The rheumatology telephone helpline is a nurse-led essential service that provides reliable medical advice, social and psychological support to help patients cope with the disease. An efficient service is especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic as a significant proportion of rheumatology patients are ‘shielding’ because of immunosuppression and their underlying chronic rheumatological conditions. The pandemic resulted in several drastic changes to the rheumatology department at United Lincolnshire Hospital Trust (ULHT), such re-deployment of staff to the frontline. We performed a local audit to assess patient satisfaction and fulfilment of expectations with the helpline during the lockdown and identify areas of improvement to provide an effective helpline service. Methods Patients accessed the helpline by leaving a message over the phone and fifty patients were selected using random sampling. We designed a questionnaire in adherence to RCN guideline. After their query was resolved and obtaining their consent, we assessed their experience by calling them. We analysed the subject of the query and the outcome of the call retrospectively. We aimed to determine if they were psychologically supported, satisfied with the response time and overall, how the query was resolved. We explored their feedback and alternative choices had the helpline not been available. Results A significant proportion (40%) of queries were regarding worsening symptoms of rheumatological conditions. Some of these queries were in context of COVID-19. 35% of the queries were medications related. 94% of the calls were attended within 48 hours. Of 50 patients, 88% (44/50) were satisfied with the response time, 82% (41/50) were satisfied with the overall service, and 88% (44/50) felt they were psychologically supported. 94% (47/50) of the respondents have said that they will call the helpline again if required. Had the helpline not been available, 64% (32/50) patients would have visited their GP and 10% (5/50) would have attended A&E. Nearly 29% of the outcome of the queries were verbal advice alone without further consultations. Other major outcomes were appointment with doctors and prescription renewals. Patient feedback allowed us to identify issues involving communication between patients, GPs and the rheumatology department. Conclusion The helpline continued to be highly appreciated by the patients. It plays a crucial role in alleviating patients’ medical and psychological concerns and maintaining continuity of care. During the pandemic, there is an increased necessity to access an effective helpline. Several important changes were made to streamline the information on the trust’s rheumatology web page. We also amended the voice message to better triage patients. A rheumatology helpline template was added for record keeping through the digital dictation system. This will allow the department to communicate with GPs within 48 hours of response; to alert them regarding changes in medications or other management recommendations. Disclosure A.T.

During the period of December 29, 2019 through March 31, 2020, it has infected 750890 people worldwide, resulting in 36405 deaths with a mortality rate of 4.84%. The infections were more frequent among male gender with above 60 years of age. The mean growth rate index for total number of cases from January 23 to March 31, 2020 was 1.20 and growth rate index for mortality rate was 1.12. There was a positive association between the prevalence and mortality rate (R(2)=0.996). The novel coronavirus COVID-19 is highly contagious and has affected a large number of people worldwide. It is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends. The global health officials have taken priority measures to prevent the further outbreaks of this emerging pathogen across the globe. However, the rising number of cases and mortality risk estimates are demonstrating that enhanced public health mediations, good hygienic conditions, social distancing and movement limitations may control the COVID-19 epidemics.","Meo, Sultan Ayoub; Al-Khlaiwi, Thamir; Usmani, Adnan Mahmood; Meo, Anusha Sultan; Klonoff, David C.; Hoang, Thanh D.",J King Saud Univ Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292261/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1018364720301518; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1018364720301518?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jksus.2020.04.004,414

Initial reports from the outbreak in Italy, China and the USA have provided anecdotal evidence of improved outcomes with the administration of anti-IL-6 agents, and large-scale trials evaluating these therapies are ongoing. STUDY DESCRIPTION: In this retrospective case series, clinical outcomes and correlates of response to treatment with the IL-6 receptor antagonist sarilumab are described for 15 patients with COVID-19 from a single institution in Southern Italy. Among 10 patients whose symptoms improved after sarilumab treatment, rapid decreases in CRP levels corresponded with clinical improvement. Lower levels of IL-6 at baseline as well as lower neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio as compared with patients whose COVID-19 did not improve with treatment were associated with sarilumab-responsive disease. CONCLUSIONS: This observation may reflect a possible clinical benefit regarding early intervention with IL-6-modulatory therapies for COVID-19 and that CRP could be a potential biomarker of response to treatment.","Montesarchio, Vincenzo; Parella, Roberto; Iommelli, Chiara; Bianco, Antonella; Manzillo, Elio; Fraganza, Fiorentino; Palumbo, Cristiana; Rea, Gaetano; Murino, Patrizia; De Rosa, Rosanna; Atripaldi, Luigi; D’Abbraccio, Maurizio; Curvietto, Marcello; Mallardo, Domenico; Celentano, Egidio; Grimaldi, Antonio Maria; Palla, Marco; Trojaniello, Claudia; Vitale, Maria Grazia; Million-Weaver, Samuel Lewis; Ascierto, Paolo Antonio",J Immunother Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32784217/; https://doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2020-001089,414

This study explored the early impact of COVID-19 on the emotional well-being of patients and self-reported changes in their home therapy since the start of the pandemic. METHODS: Adult patients with CF, lung-transplanted (LTX) CF patients and parents of children with CF completed an online questionnaire, securely linked to their medical files. The questionnaire covered the emotional impact of the pandemic, changes in CF and LTX treatment, changes in health-protecting behaviours and CF-related concerns, and their perception of their COVID-19 status. RESULTS: The response rate was 63% (80 CF, 66 LTX and 73 parents). A wide range of illness severity was included. None of the respondents had contracted COVID-19 and all strictly followed the social distancing rules. There was evident psychological impact, with many reporting increased stress, fear and worry about CF and the future. Changes in treatment were positive, including more physiotherapy for adults and better-quality nebulizing. Changes in routine were reported, such as different treatment timing. Adult patients and parents had cancelled their CF appointments more often since the start of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The initial psychological impact of COVID-19 was evident. The impact on home treatment was reassuringly small. Psychological care is needed for patients suffering prolonged psychological impact, and CF teams need to contextualize the information that patients and parents receive from the media and support them to balance the perceived risk with true risk.","Havermans, Trudy; Houben, Janne; Vermeulen, Francois; Boon, Mieke; Proesmans, Marijke; Lorent, Natalie; de Soir, Erik; Vos, Robin; Dupont, Lieven",J Cyst Fibros,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcf.2020.07.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569199320308158; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1569199320308158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32768311/,414

In light of future pandemics or subsequent waves of COVID‐19 it is crucial to focus on the ethical issues that were and still are raised in this COVID‐19 crisis. In this paper, we look at issues that are raised in the testing and tracing of patients with COVID‐19. We do this by highlighting and expanding on an approach suggested by Fineberg that could serve as a public health approach. In this way, we highlight several ethical issues. As regards testing, questions are raised such as whether it is ethical to use less reliable tests in order to increase testing capacity or minimize harm for patients. Another issue is how wide testing should be and whether selective testing is in accordance with principles of social justice. Patients who have recovered from COVID‐19 might have some degree of immunity but attributing certain ‘immunopriviliges’ raises ethical questions. The use of various tracing methodologies (mobile apps or databases and trained tracers) raised evident questions of social justice and privacy. We argue why it is key to always uphold a test of proportionality where a fair balance must be sought.","Raus, Kasper; Mortier, Eric; Eeckloo, Kristof",Bioethics,https://doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12877; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33951206/,414

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the epidemiological, clinical, and molecular characteristics of HAdV infections among hospitalized children with ARTI in Hebei, Northern China from June 2017 to May 2018. STUDY DESIGN: A 12-month longitudinal, retrospective study on HAdV, typed by nested polymerase chain reaction targeting the hexon gene’s hypervariable region (typing was merely performed by sequencing of the hexon neutralization epitope and thus genotypes could not be identified unequivocally), associated with ARTI was performed. The epidemiological and clinical data of different types of HAdV were analyzed using statistical product and service solutions (SPSS) 21.0 software. RESULTS: HAdV was detected in 330 (3.71%) of the 8906 specimens, with most (88.48%, 292/330) HAdV-positives cases detected among children < 3 years old. HAdV were detected throughout the year with a higher prevalence in spring. 11 types were identified, with HAdV-2 (33.33%, 110/330) as the predominant type, followed by HAdV-3 (21.21%, 70/330) and HAdV-7 (13.94%, 46/330). Of the 330 HAdV-positive specimens, 247 (74.85%) were co-detected with other respiratory pathogens, most commonly rhinovirus (HRV) (58.7%, 145/247). Additionally, patients with HAdV-7 positive had longer duration of fever than HAdV-2 or -3 positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: During the study period, HAdV-2, HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 were the predominant types identified from children with ARTI in Hebei Province. Pediatric patients with HAdV-7 positive may not present more severe clinical outcome except a longer duration of fever.","Zhao, Meng-chuan; Guo, Ying-hui; Qiu, Fang-zhou; Wang, Le; Yang, Shuo; Feng, Zhi-shan; Li, Gui-xia",J Clin Virol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2019.104254; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653219302847; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653219302847; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31901884/,414

MATERIALS AND METHODS Single center 5-year retrospective analysis of 625 catheters in 293 adult patients. Patient data included age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and common comorbidities. Procedural details included type of procedure (new insertion vs. exchange), operator seniority, side of insertion, catheter model and presence of catheter wings skin-sutures. Complications were reported as cumulative risk over time and Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate risk factors for cuff extrusion (CE). RESULTS Median patient follow-up was 503 days (188,913 catheter-days) and median catheter survival 163 days. CE occurred in 23.8% of catheters, at a rate of 0.79 per 1,000 catheter-days and a median time of 64 days. It was more common than infection (14.6%) and inadequate flow (15.5%). The 1-month and 12-month risk of CE was 5.9% and 21.3% respectively. A first episode of CE was a strong predictor of future CE episodes. The only patient factor that affected the risk of CE was BMI (Hazard Ratio 2.36 for obese patients). Procedural factors that affected the risk of CE, adjusted for BMI, were catheter model, type of procedure (lower risk for new insertions) and catheter wings skin-sutures; the latter reduced the 30-day CE risk by 76% without increasing catheter-related infections. CONCLUSION Cuff extrusion is common in long-term THDCs. The risk increases with obesity, history of previous cuff extrusion, certain catheter models and absence of wing-sutures.","Flavius, Parvulescu; Matthew J, Oliver; Myrtha E, Reyna; Robyn, Pugash; Elizabeth, David",Canadian Association of Radiologists journal = Journal l'Association canadienne des radiologistes,https://doi.org/10.1177/08465371211041241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579540/,414

With a long history of use for infectious disease applications, maps and geographic information systems (GIS) have been widely used in recent months for surveillance and risk prediction mapping. The Value Institute’s Geospatial Analytics Core applied spatial methodologies to inform ChristianaCare’s pandemic response around telehealth, testing disparities, and test site prioritization. METHODS: Descriptive data related to disparities in telehealth utilization were mapped to identify areas in which intervention is needed to increase telehealth access. Cluster detection methodology was used to identify “hot” and “cold” spots for COVID-19 testing by place and race across New Castle County, DE. A composite risk score was created to prioritize communities for testing sites. All analyses took place in Delaware from March-June 2020, with particular emphasis on New Castle County. RESULTS: Parts of northeastern New Castle County and western Sussex County were highlighted for intervention to increase broadband internet access for telehealth utilization. “Cold” spots for COVID-19 testing were found in New Castle County, indicating neighborhoods in which testing levels were significantly lower than expected. Data for testing levels, disease positivity, and socioeconomic risk factors were used to identify communities in northeastern New Castle County that warranted new test sites to mitigate disease spread. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS: Geospatial methodologies can be used to combine electronic health record data and population-level spatial data for pandemic response efforts. This allows health systems to confidently identify areas of need while mitigating disparities in resource allocation.","Brooks, Madeline; Brown, Chenesia; Liu, Wei; Siegel, Scott D.",Dela J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34467114/; https://doi.org/10.32481/djph.2020.07.018,414
605047,Yeast expression and characterization of SARS-CoV N protein,2005-07-18,"COVID-19 pandemic continues to obstruct social lives and the world economy other than questioning the healthcare capacity of many countries. Weather components recently came to notice as the northern hemisphere was hit by escalated incidence in winter. This study investigated the association between COVID-19 cases and two components, average temperature and relative humidity, in the 16 states of Germany. Three main approaches were carried out in this study, namely temporal correlation, spatial auto-correlation, and clustering-integrated panel regression. It is claimed that the daily COVID-19 cases correlate negatively with the average temperature and positively with the average relative humidity. To extract the spatial auto-correlation, both global Moran’s [Formula: see text] and global Geary’s [Formula: see text] were used whereby no significant difference in the results was observed. It is evident that randomness overwhelms the spatial pattern in all the states for most of the observations, except in recent observations where either local clusters or dispersion occurred. This is further supported by Moran’s scatter plot, where states’ dynamics to and fro cold and hot spots are identified, rendering a traveling-related early warning system. A random-effects model was used in the sense of case-weather regression including incidence clustering. Our task is to perceive which ranges of the incidence that are well predicted by the existing weather components rather than seeing which ranges of the weather components predicting the incidence. The proposed clustering-integrated model associated with optimal barriers articulates the data well whereby weather components outperform lag incidence cases in the prediction. Practical implications based on marginal effects follow posterior to model diagnostics.","Ganegoda, Naleen Chaminda; Wijaya, Karunia Putra; Amadi, Miracle; Erandi, K. K. W.

Multiple regression models investigated the independent factors associated with PQ and WC. RESULTS: The final analysis included 569 patients with diabetes (54.7% female), with an average age of 58.1 years. TMTA services' PQ and WC were high. A higher education and being unemployed were factors associated with an increased WC. Older age was negatively related to PQ. Perceived support from TMTA service was positively associated with PQ and WC. Perceived increase in disease self-management was positively associated with PQ and WC.

Conversion of non‐clinical space into medical units designated for Covid‐19 patients became necessary to accommodate this mandate. METHODS: Non‐clinical space was converted into medical units at multiple campuses of a large academic hospital system over 1 week. The conversion required construction to deliver basic care including oxygen supplementation. Creation of provider workspaces, handwashing areas, and colour‐coded infection control zones was prioritized. Selection criteria were created with a workflow to determine appropriate patients for transfer into converted space. Staffing of converted space shifted as hospitalizations surged. RESULTS: The unit was open for 18 days and accommodated 170 unique patients. Five patients (2.9%) required transfer to a higher level of care.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG is an important consideration for the patients in this COVID-19 pandemic. Recent researches suggested the rapid decay of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the general population, but the decline rate of the antibodies in cancer patients was unknown. In this observational study, we reported the clinical features of the 53 cancer patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan, China and tracked the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the patients for more than 12 months. We found the duration (days) of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the patients was significant longer in chemotherapy (mean: 175; range: 75 to 315) and radiotherapy groups (mean: 168; range: 85 to 265) than in non-chemo- or radio-therapy group (mean: 58; range: 21 to 123) after their recovery from COVID-19. We also used single-cell RNA sequencing to track the immunologic changes in a representative patient recovered from COVID-19 and found that CD8 + effective T cells, memory B cells and plasma cells were persistently activated in the patient undergoing chemotherapy.

Eight cold-temperature indices, average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, and the temperature humidity index, wind chill index, apparent temperature, effective temperature (ET), and net effective temperature and their standardized Z scores were applied to distributed lag non-linear models. Index-specific cumulative 26-day (lag 0–25) mortality risk, cumulative 8-day (lag 0–7) outpatient visit risk, and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated at 1 and 2 standardized deviations below the median temperature, comparing with the Z score of the lowest risks for mortality and outpatient visits. The average temperature was adequate to evaluate the mortality risk from all causes and circulatory diseases. Excess all-cause mortality increased for 17–24% when average temperature was at Z = − 1, and for 27–41% at Z = − 2 among study areas. The cold-temperature indices were inconsistent in estimating risk of outpatient visits. Average temperature and THI were appropriate indices for measuring risk for all-cause outpatient visits. Relative risk of all-cause outpatient visits increased slightly by 2–7% when average temperature was at Z = − 1, but no significant risk at Z = − 2. Minimum temperature estimated the strongest risk associated with outpatient visits of respiratory diseases. In conclusion, the relationships between cold temperatures and health varied among study areas, types of health event, and the cold-temperature indices applied.

In this study, we tried to potentiate the immunoprotection efficacy of our previous CVB3-specific VP1 protein vaccine by introducing a streptococcal protein G-derived, draining lymph nodes (dLNs)-targeting albumin-binding domain (ABD) peptide. We found that compared with the original VP1 vaccine, ABD-fused VP1 (ABD-VP1) vaccine gained the new ability to efficiently bind murine albumin both in vitro and in vivo, possessed a much longer serum half-life in serum and exhibited more abundance in the dLNs after immunization. Accordingly, ABD-VP1 immunization not only significantly facilitated the enrichment and maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), induced higher percentages of IFN-γ(+) CD8(+) cells in the dLNs, but also robustly promoted VP1-induced T cell proliferation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in the spleens. More importantly, ABD-VP1 also elicited higher percentages of protective CD44(hi) CD62L(hi) memory T cells in dLNs and spleens. Consequently, obvious protective effect against viral myocarditis was conferred by ABD-VP1 vaccine compared to the VP1 vaccine, reflected by the less body weight loss, improved cardiac function, alleviated cardiac histomorphological changes and an increased 28-day survival rate. Our results indicated that the ABD might be a promising immune-enhancing regime for vaccine design and development.","Gao, Yue; Yue, Yan; Xiong, Sidong",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34630378/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.666594,414

We evaluated the performance of 18 commercially available SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. Early (6–8 days after the start of symptoms) and late sera (>14 days) from ICU patients (n=10 and n=16, respectively) and healthcare workers (n=5 and n=9, respectively) were included. Additionally, 22 sera were included to detect potential cross-reactivity. Test characteristics were determined for the 18 assays. In >14 days samples, the Vircell IgG and Wantai Ig ELISAs had superior sensitivity compared to the other ELISAs (96%). Furthermore, the Roche Ig, the Epitope Diagnostics IgM, Wantai IgM, Euroimmun IgG, and IgA all showed a specificity of 100%. The POCTs of Boson Biotech and ACRO Biotech showed the highest sensitivities: 100% and 96% (83.5–99.8), respectively. The POCT of Orient Gene Biotech, VOMED Diagnostics, and Coris-Bioconcept showed highest specificities (100%). For the IgM and IgA assays, the Euroimmun IgA test showed the highest sensitivity in early samples: 46.7% (23.5–70.9) to 53.3% (29.1–76.5). In general, all tests performed better in patients with severe symptoms (ICU patients). We conclude that the Wantai Ig and Vircell IgG ELISAs may be suitable for diagnostic purposes. The IgM/IgA tests performed poorer than their IgG/Ig counterparts but may have a role in diagnoses of SARS-CoV-2 in a population in which the background seroprevalence of IgG high, and IgM and/or IgA may distinguish between acute or past infection.

Similarly, coronaviruses cause seasonal mild infections, epidemics, and even pandemics and can lead to severe respiratory symptoms. It is important to develop broadly acting antiviral molecules to efficiently tackle the infections caused by thes. Areas covered: This review illuminates the differences and similarities between enteroviruses and coronaviruses and examines the most appealing therapeutic targets to combat both virus groups. Publications of both virus groups and deposited structures discovered through PubMed to March 2021 for viral proteases have been evaluated. Expert opinion: The main protease of coronaviruses and enteroviruses share similarities in their structure and function. These proteases process their viral polyproteins and thus drugs that bind to the active site have potential to target both virus groups. It is important to develop drugs that target more evolutionarily conserved processes and proteins. Moreover, it is a wise strategy to concentrate on processes that are similar between several virus families.","Marjomäki, Varpu; Kalander, Kerttu; Hellman, Maarit; Permi, Perttu",Expert Opin Ther Targets,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34253126/; https://doi.org/10.1080/14728222.2021.1952985,414

As we known, the epidemic was caused by imported cases in other provinces of China except for Hubei in 2020. In this paper, we developed a differential equation model with tracing isolation strategy with close contacts of newly confirmed cases and discrete time imported cases, to perform assessment and risk analysis for COVID-19 outbreaks in Tianjin and Chongqing city. Firstly, the model behavior without imported cases was given. Then, the real-time regeneration number in Tianjin and Chongqing city revealed a trend of rapidly rising, and then falling fast. Finally, sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the earlier with Wuhan lock-down, the fewer cases in these two cities. One can obtain that the tracing isolation of close contacts of newly confirmed cases could effectively control the spread of the disease. But it is not sensitive for the more contact tracing isolation days on confirmed cases, the fewer cases.

METHOD: A qualitative explorative study was conducted, which involved ten semi-structured individual telephone interviews with social workers. The study sample included employees within the social service, working in a specialised case unit who had experience of referring children and/or adolescents to the medical home model called Hälsofam. Data were analysed inductively using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The findings of the current study indicated that working with Hälsofam has offered social workers a way into the health care sector and an active collaborative working situation, with focus on organised work across the ‘silos’ of care services. However, the findings raised the question of whether or not all children and adolescents have the same possibility to receive care from Hälsofam. CONCLUSION: The findings indicated that the Hälsofam model had a positive impact on the interrelations between the social service and the health care sector. Yet, findings showed that personal views of the social worker and the societal situation in which they operate create limitations for providing care for every child and adolescent.

We recently established an in vitro model of EAV persistence in cell culture for the purpose of furthering our understanding of EAV biology in general and viral persistence in the stallion in particular. In this study we investigated whether persistently infected HeLa cells could be cured of EAV infection by treatment with an antisense peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PPMO) designed to target the 5′-terminal region of the EAV genome. We found that persistently infected HeLa cells passaged three times in the presence of 5–10 μM EAV-specific PPMO produced no detectable virus. The PPMO-cured HeLa cells were free of infectious virus, viral antigen and EAV RNA as measured by plaque assay, indirect immunofluorescence assay and RT-PCR, respectively. Furthermore, when re-challenged with EAV at several passages after discontinuation of PPMO treatments, PPMO-cured HeLa cells were found to be refractory to re-infection and to the re-establishment of viral persistence. While these findings demonstrate that PPMO can be used to eliminate persistent EAV infection in cell culture, the efficacy of PPMO against EAV in vivo remains to be addressed.","Zhang, Jianqiang; Stein, David A.; Timoney, Peter J.; Balasuriya, Udeni B.R.",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20206215/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170210000808; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2010.02.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170210000808,414
614138,Identification of residues on human receptor DPP4 critical for MERS-CoV binding and entry,2014-10-21,"It has been confirmed that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can transmit through droplets created when an infected human coughs or sneezes. Accordingly, 1.83-m (6-feet) social distancing is advised to reduce the spread of the disease among humans. This is based on the assumption that no air circulation exists around people. However, it is not well investigated whether the ambient wind and relative humidity (RH) will cause SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets to transport farther in the air, making the current social distancing policy insufficient. To provide evidence and insight into the “social distancing” guidelines, a validated computational fluid-particle dynamics (CFPD) model was employed to simulate the transient transport, condensation/evaporation, and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets emitted by coughs, with different environmental wind velocities and RHs. Initial droplet diameters range from 2 to 2000 μm, and the wind velocities range from 0 to 16 km/h, representing different wind forces from calm air to moderate breeze. The comparison between a steady-state wind and a gust with a constant frequency has also been performed. Ambient RHs are 40% and 99.5%. The distances between the two virtual humans are 1.83 m and 3.05 m (6 feet and 10 feet). The facial covering effect on reducing the airborne transmission of the cough droplets has also been evaluated. Numerical results indicate that the ambient wind will enhance the complexity of the secondary flows with recirculation between the two virtual humans. Microdroplets follow the airflow streamlines well and deposit on both human bodies and head regions, even with the 3.05-m (10-feet) separation distance. The rest of the microdroplets can transport in the air farther than 3.05 m (10 feet) due to wind convection, causing a potential health risk to nearby people. High RH will increase the droplet sizes due to the hygroscopic growth effect, which increases the deposition fractions on both humans and the ground. With the complex environmental wind and RH conditions, the 6-feet social distancing policy may not be sufficient to protect the inter-person aerosol transmission, since the suspending micro-droplets were influenced by convection effects and can be transported from the human coughs/sneezes to the other human in less than 5 s. Thus, due to the complex real-world environmental ventilation conditions, a social distance longer than 6 feet needs to be considered. Wearing masks should also be recommended for both infected and healthy humans to reduce the airborne cough droplet numbers.","Feng, Yu; Marchal, Thierry; Sperry, Ted; Yi, Hang",J Aerosol Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2020.105585; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021850220300744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427227/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850220300744?v=s5,414

We aimed to develop a risk map for rubella epidemics in Japan by geographic location via analysis of seroepidemiological data and accounting for the abundance of foreign visitors. METHODS: Geographic age distribution and seroprevalence were used to compute the age- and sex-dependent next-generation matrix in each region. We computed the probability of a major epidemic using the assumed number of untraced imported rubella cases proportionally modeled to the number of foreign travelers. RESULTS: Risks of a major epidemic were high in areas with capital cities, while areas with a greater fraction of older people yielded smaller effective reproduction numbers, a lower volume of foreign travelers, and thus a lower probability of a major epidemic. The volume of susceptible adult males was larger in urban geographic regions, having a greater number of foreign travelers than remote areas. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with the observation of multiple large clusters of rubella cases in urban areas during 2012–2014 and 2018–2019.

Although it may contribute to the reduction of systemic inflammation associated with depression, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial physical exercise effects in emotional behavior remain to be elucidated. Current investigations indicate that a rapid release of extracellular vesicles into the circulation might be the signaling mediators of systemic adaptations to physical exercise. These biological entities are now well-established intercellular communicators, playing a major role in relevant physiological and pathophysiological functions, including brain cell–cell communication. We also reviewed emerging evidence correlating depression with modified circulating extracellular vesicle surfaces and cargo signatures (e.g., microRNAs and proteins), envisioned as potential biomarkers for diagnosis, efficient disease stratification and appropriate therapeutic management. Accordingly, the clinical data summarized in the present review prompted us to hypothesize that physical exercise-related circulating extracellular vesicles contribute to its antidepressant effects, particularly through the modulation of inflammation. This review sheds light on the triad “physical exercise–extracellular vesicles–depression” and suggests new avenues in this novel emerging field.","Soares, Edna; Reis, Julie; Rodrigues, Mariana; Ribeiro, Carlos Fontes; Pereira, Frederico C.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33430399/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22020542,414

Analysis of clinical features in light of most recently published data allows for improved understanding, and better clinical judgement. A thorough search was performed to collect all articles published from 1st of January to 1st of June 2020, using the keywords COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 followed by the generic terms elderly, older adults or older individuals. The quality assessment of studies and findings was performed by an adaptation of the STROBE statement and CERQual approach. Excluding duplicates, a total of 1598 articles were screened, of which 20 studies were included in the final analysis, pertaining to 4965 older COVID-19 patients (≥60 years old). Variety in symptoms was observed, with fever, cough, dyspnea, fatigue, or sputum production being the most common. Prominent changes in laboratory findings consistently indicated lymphopenia and inflammation and in some cases organ damage. Radiological examination reveals ground glass opacities with occasional consolidations, bilaterally, with a possible peripheral tendency. An evident fraction of the elderly population (25.7%) developed renal injury or impairment as a complication. Roughly 71.4% of the older adults require supplementary oxygen, while invasive mechanical ventilation was required in almost a third of the reported hospitalized older individuals. In this review, death occurred in 20.0% of total patients with a recorded outcome (907/4531). Variability in confidence of findings is documented. Variety in symptom presentation is to be expected, and abnormalities in laboratory findings are present. Risk for mortality is evident, and attention to the need for supplementary oxygen and possible mechanical ventilation is advised. Further data is required isolating this age population. Presented literature may allow for the construction of better predictive models of COVID-19 in older populations.","Neumann-Podczaska, Agnieszka; Al-Saad, Salwan R; Karbowski, Lukasz M; Chojnicki, Michal; Tobis, Slawomir; Wieczorowska-Tobis, Katarzyna",Aging Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32765959/; https://doi.org/10.14336/ad.2020.0620,414

No clinically proven drugs are available yet as the targeted therapeutic agents for the treatment of this disease. The viral main protease which helps in replication and transcription inside the host can be an effective drug target. In the present study, we aimed to discover the potential of β-adrenoceptor agonists and adenosine deaminase inhibitors which are used in asthma and cancer/inflammatory disorders, respectively, as repurposing drugs against protease inhibitor by ligand-based and structure-based virtual screening using COVID-19 protease-N3 complex. The AARRR pharmacophore model was used to screen a set of 22,621 molecules to obtain hits, which were subjected to high-throughput virtual screening. Extra precision docking identified four top-scored molecules such as +/−-fenoterol, FR236913 and FR230513 with lower binding energy from both categories. Docking identified three major hydrogen bonds with Gly143, Glu166 and Gln189 residues. 100 ns MD simulation was performed for four top-scored molecules to analyze the stability, molecular mechanism and energy requirements. MM/PBSA energy calculation suggested that van der Waals and electrostatic energy components are the main reasons for the stability of complexes. Water-mediated hydrogen bonds between protein-ligand and flexibility of the ligand are found to be responsible for providing extra stability to the complexes. The insights gained from this combinatorial approach can be used to design more potent and bio-available protease inhibitors against novel coronavirus. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Unfortunately, additional clinically significant treatment options since the approval of remdesivir are scarce. To overcome the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) more efficiently, a treatment strategy that controls not only SARS-CoV-2 replication but also the host entry step should be considered. In this study, we used MT-DTI to predict FDA approved drugs that may have strong affinities for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) which are essential for viral entry to the host cell. Of the 460 drugs with K(d) of less than 100 nM for the ACE2 receptor, 17 drugs overlapped with drugs that inhibit the interaction of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike reported in the NCATS OpenData portal. Among them, enalaprilat, an ACE inhibitor, showed a K(d) value of 1.5 nM against the ACE2. Furthermore, three of the top 30 drugs with strong affinity prediction for the TMPRSS2 are anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) drugs, including ombitasvir, daclatasvir, and paritaprevir. Notably, of the top 30 drugs, AT1R blocker eprosartan and neuropsychiatric drug lisuride showed similar gene expression profiles to potential TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Collectively, we suggest that drugs predicted to have strong inhibitory potencies to ACE2 and TMPRSS2 through the DTI model should be considered as potential drug repurposing candidates for COVID-19.","Choi, Yoonjung; Shin, Bonggun; Kang, Keunsoo; Park, Sungsoo; Beck, Bo Ram",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12111325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33218024/,414

Currently, the risk of contracting COVID-19 in hospitals when admitted for surgery and the susceptibility due to adjuvant therapies and associated mortality due to COVID-19 is unknown, but knowledge of these potential risks would help treating clinicians provide appropriate cancer care. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What is the risk of hospital-acquired COVID-19 in patients with musculoskeletal tumors admitted for surgery during the initial period of the pandemic? (2) What is the associated mortality in patients with musculoskeletal tumors who have contracted COVID-19? (3) Are patients with musculoskeletal tumors who have had neoadjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or radiation) preoperatively at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19? (4) Is a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade in patients with musculoskeletal tumors associated with an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 when admitted to the hospital for surgery? METHODS: This retrospective, observational study analyzed patients with musculoskeletal tumors who underwent surgery in one of eight specialist centers in the United Kingdom, which included the five designated cancer centers in England, one specialist soft tissue sarcoma center, and two centers from Scotland between March 12, 2020 and May 20, 2020. A total of 347 patients were included, with a median (range) age of 53 years (10 to 94); 60% (207 of 347) were men, and the median ASA grade was II (I to IV). These patients had a median hospital stay of 8 days (0 to 53). Eighteen percent (61 of 347) of patients had received neoadjuvant therapy (8% [27] chemotherapy, 8% [28] radiation, 2% [6] chemotherapy and radiation) preoperatively. The decision to undergo surgery was made in adherence with United Kingdom National Health Service and national orthopaedic oncology guidelines, but specific data with regard to the number of patients within each category are not known. Fifty-nine percent (204 of 347) were negative in PCR testing done 48 hours before the surgical procedure; the remaining 41% (143 of 347) were treated before preoperative PCR testing was made mandatory, but these patients were asymptomatic. All patients were followed for 30 days postoperatively, and none were lost to follow-up during that period. The primary outcome of the study was contracting COVID-19 in the hospital after admission. The secondary outcome was associated mortality after contracting COVID-19 within 30 days of the surgical procedure. In addition, we assessed whether there is any association between ASA grade or neoadjuvant treatment and the chances of contracting COVID-19 in the hospital. Electronic patient record system and simple descriptive statistics were used to analyze both outcomes. RESULTS: Four percent (12 of 347) of patients contracted COVID-19 in the hospital, and 1% (4 of 347) of patients died because of COVID-19-related complications. Patients with musculoskeletal tumors who contracted COVID-19 had increased mortality compared with patients who were asymptomatic or tested negative (odds ratio 55.33 [95% CI 10.60 to 289.01]; p < 0.001).With the numbers we had, we could not show that adjuvant therapy had any association with contracting COVID-19 while in the hospital (OR 0.94 [95% CI 0.20 to 4.38]; p = 0.93). Increased ASA grade was associated with an increased likelihood of contracting COVID-19 (OR 58 [95% CI 5 to 626]; p < 0.001) CONCLUSION: Our results show that surgeons must be mindful and inform patients that those with musculoskeletal tumors are at risk of contracting COVID-19 while admitted to the hospital and some may succumb to it. Hospital administrators and governmental agencies should be aware that operations on patients with lower ASA grade appear to have lower risk and should consider restructuring service delivery to ensure that procedures are performed in designated COVID-19-restricted sites. These measures may reduce the likelihood of patients contracting the virus in the hospital, although we cannot confirm a benefit from this study. Future studies should seek to identify factors influencing these outcomes and also compare surgical complications in those patients with and without COVID-19.

617596,SARS-CoV-2 will continue to circulate in the human population: an opinion from the point of view of the virus-host relationship,2020-04-30,"BACKGROUND: People living in group situations or with dementia are more vulnerable to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Older people and those with multimorbidity have higher mortality if they become infected than the general population. However, no systematic study exists of COVID-19-related outcomes in older inpatients in psychiatric units, who comprise people from these high-risk groups. We aimed to describe the period prevalence, demographics, symptoms (and asymptomatic cases), management, and survival outcomes of COVID-19 in the older inpatient psychiatric population and people with young-onset dementia in five National Health Service Trusts in London, UK, from March 1 to April 30, 2020. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we collected demographic data, mental health diagnoses, clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, symptoms, management, and COVID-19-related outcome data of inpatients aged 65 years or older or with dementia who were already inpatients or admitted as inpatients to five London mental health Trusts between March 1 and April 30, 2020, and information about available COVID-19-related resources (ie, testing and personal protective equipment). Patients were determined to have COVID-19 if they had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, or had relevant symptoms indicative of COVID-19, as determined by their treating physician. We calculated period prevalence of COVID-19 and analysed patients’ characteristics, treatments, and outcomes. FINDINGS: Of 344 inpatients, 131 (38%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period (period prevalence 38% [95% CI 33–43]). The mean age of patients who had COVID-19 was 75·3 years (SD 8·2); 68 (52%) were women and 47 (36%) from ethnic minority groups. 16 (12%) of 131 patients were asymptomatic and 121 (92%) had one or more disease-related comorbidity. 108 (82%) patients were compulsorily detained. 74 (56%) patients had dementia, of whom 13 (18%) had young-onset dementia. On average, sites received COVID-19 testing kits 4·5 days after the first clinical COVID-19 presentation. 19 (15%) patients diagnosed with COVID-19 died during the study period, and their deaths were determined to be COVID-19 related. INTERPRETATION: Patients in psychiatric inpatient settings who were admitted without known SARS-CoV-2 infection had a high risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 compared with those in the community and had a higher proportion of deaths from COVID-19 than in the community. Implementation of the long-standing policy of parity of esteem for mental health and planning for future COVID-19 waves in psychiatric hospitals is urgent.

This was due to community mitigation measures implemented to control the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We used sentinel surveillance data to identify changes in the 2020 influenza season compared with previous seasons in Bangladesh. METHODS: We used hospital-based influenza surveillance (HBIS) data of Bangladesh that are generated year-round and are population-representative severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) data for all age groups from seven public and two private tertiary care level hospitals data from 2016 to 2019. We applied the moving epidemic method (MEM) by using R language (v4.0.3), and MEM web applications (v2.14) on influenza-positive rates of SARI cases collected weekly to estimate an average seasonal influenza curve and establish epidemic thresholds. RESULTS: The 2016–2019 average season started on epi week 18 (95% CI: 15–25) and lasted 12.5 weeks (95% CI: 12–14 weeks) until week 30.5. The 2020 influenza season started on epi week 36 and ended at epi week 41, lasting for only five weeks. Therefore, influenza epidemic started 18 weeks later, was 7.5 weeks shorter, and was less intense than the average epidemic of the four previous years. The 2020 influenza season started on the same week when COVID-19 control measures were halted, and 13 weeks after the measures were relaxed. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that seasonal influenza circulation in Bangladesh was delayed and less intense in 2020 than in previous years. Community mitigation measures may have contributed to this reduction of seasonal influenza transmission. These findings contribute to a limited but growing body of evidence that influenza seasons were altered globally in 2020.","Akhtar, Zubair; Chowdhury, Fahmida; Rahman, Mahmudur; Ghosh, Probir Kumar; Ahmmed, Md.

618297,Antibody neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 through ACE2 receptor mimicry,2021-01-11,"Background: Leading scientific societies have recommended delaying and/or suspending active cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, data on this novel infection in patients with a diagnosis of cancer receiving active treatment are scarce and it is unknown if these recommendations could have repercussions on future progress of the disease. The main objective of this study is to learn the COVID-19 incidence rate in outpatients with cancer receiving active treatment. Methods: This work is a retrospective cohort study that included all patients with a diagnosis of cancer who received active cancer treatment in two Andalusian hospitals between February 26 and May 13, 2020. Variables regarding the patient, tumor, and development of COVID-19 were collected. A descriptive analysis was performed and the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in these patients was evaluated. Results: A total of 673 patients were included. The median age was 62 years. There was a low rate of comorbidity and 12.1% had an ECOG >2. Breast cancer was the most common cancer (41%), followed by colorectal and lung cancer. Stage IV cancer was reported in 52.7% of patients. The most common treatment was chemotherapy (53.9%). Treatment was delayed or suspended in 6% of patients. Only three patients developed COVID-19. The cumulative incidence was 0.44% and one person died due to infection. Conclusions: In the present retrospective cohort study, we found a low incidence of COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer receiving active treatment in an outpatient setting. The sociodemographic factors of Andalusia may explain why these results differ from those presented by other colleagues in Spain, but raise questions about whether universal recommendations may put the benefits of antineoplastic therapy at risk.","Martín-Bravo, Celia; Quirós, Raúl; Blancas, Isabel; Villatoro-Roldán, Rosa; Robles, Marta; Alcaide, Julia; Navarro, Víctor; Pérez, Diego; Zarcos, Irene; Rivas-Ruiz, Francisco; Pérez-Ruiz, Elisabeth; Quero, Cristina",Semin Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33832767/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093775421000026; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0093775421000026; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.seminoncol.2021.01.002,414

This prospective cross-sectional study explored the inflammatory profiles and clinical recovery of COVID-19 patients at 3 months post-discharge. METHODS: COVID-19 patients discharged from four hospitals in Wuhan, recovered asymptomatic patients (APs) from an isolation hotel, and uninfected healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Viral nucleic acid and antibody detection, laboratory examination, computed tomography, pulmonary function assessment, multiplex cytokine assay, and flow cytometry were performed. RESULTS: The 72 age-, sex- and body mass index-matched participants included 19 severe/critical patients (SPs), 20 mild/moderate patients (MPs), 16 APs, and 17 HCs. At 3 months after discharge, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and factors related to vascular injury/repair in recovered COVID-19 patients had not returned to those of the HCs, especially among recovered SPs compared to recovered MPs and APs. These cytokines were significantly correlated with impaired pulmonary function and chest CT abnormalities. However, levels of immune cells had returned to nearly normal levels and were not significantly correlated with abnormal clinical features. CONCLUSION: Vascular injury, inflammation, and chemotaxis persisted in COVID-19 patients and were correlated with abnormal clinical features 3 months after discharge, especially in recovered SPs.","Zhou, Mei; Yin, Zhengrong; Xu, Juanjuan; Wang, Sufei; Liao, Tingting; Wang, Kai; Li, Yumei; Yang, Fan; Wang, Zhen; Yang, Guanghai; Zhang, Jianchu; Yang, Jin",J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33822106/,414

Methods A questionnaire was distributed to patients on discharge. The responses were analyzed once they were returned by mail. Results Responses were received from 27 of 39 patients (average age, 50 ± 17 years). Among the participants, 16 were male (59.3%), 19 were symptomatic (70.4%), and two required a ventilator (7.4%). Anxiety about symptom exacerbation was reported by 36.0% of participants. Quarantine-associated stress was experienced by 60.0% of participants, and 72.0% of participants supported the change in federal policy that allows asymptomatic patients and patients with mild conditions to isolate themselves at a hotel or their home. Following discharge, 44.0% of participants experienced anxieties regarding their lives after discharge, and 56.0% were anxious regarding discrimination and rumors. During hospitalization, 68.0% of participants re-evaluated their attitude toward health, 44.0% regretted the preventative measures they took before contracting COVID-19, and 44.0% felt guilty for becoming infected. Conclusions Participants experienced various kinds of stress related to hospitalization for COVID-19. There was a trend of people being more concerned about their relationships than their own health. Therefore, as asymptomatic participants and participants with mild symptoms also experienced psychological stresses, it is also necessary to consider the psychological and social effects of the disease.","Goda, Ken; Kenzaka, Tsuneaki; Yahata, Shinsuke; Kumabe, Ayako; Katsurada, Masahiro; Nishisaki, Hogara",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34584819/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.18202,414

The complexity of pediatric heart transplant patients has increased as medical and surgical management for patients with congenital heart disease continues to improve. Quality of life in patients with heart failure and transplant might be affected by the impact on functional status that heart failure, heart failure complications or treatment might have. Functional areas affected might be motor, exercise capacity, feeding, speech and/or cognition. The goal of rehabilitation is to enhance and restore functional ability and quality of life to those with physical impairments or disabilities. Some of these rehabilitation interventions such as exercise training have been extensively evaluated in adults with heart failure. Literature in the pediatric population is limited yet promising. The use of additional rehabilitation interventions geared toward specific complications experienced by patients with heart failure or heart transplant are potentially helpful. The use of individualized multidisciplinary rehabilitation program that includes medical management, rehabilitation equipment and the use of physical, occupational, speech and feeding therapies can help improve the quality of life of patients with heart failure and transplant.","Ubeda Tikkanen, Ana; Berry, Emily; LeCount, Erin; Engstler, Katherine; Sager, Meredith; Esteso, Paul",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34095033/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.674156,414

There has been remarkable progress in dengue virus vaccine development; however, there are no licensed antivirals for dengue disease, and none appear to be in clinical trials. We took the approach of repositioning approved drugs for anti-dengue virus activity by screening a library of pharmacologically active compounds. We identified N-desmethylclozapine, fluoxetine hydrochloride, and salmeterol xinafoate as dengue virus inhibitors based on reductions in the numbers of infected cells and viral titers. Dengue virus RNA levels were diminished in inhibitor-treated cells, and this effect was specific to dengue virus, as other flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus, or other RNA viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus and rotavirus, were not affected by these inhibitors. All three inhibitors specifically inhibited dengue virus replication with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) in the high-nanomolar range. Estimation of negative-strand RNA intermediates and time-of-addition experiments indicated that inhibition was occurring at a postentry stage, most probably at the initiation of viral RNA replication. Finally, we show that inhibition is most likely due to the modulation of the endolysosomal pathway and induction of autophagy.","Medigeshi, Guruprasad R.; Kumar, Rinki; Dhamija, Ekta; Agrawal, Tanvi; Kar, Meenakshi",Antimicrob Agents Chemother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27572397/; https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.01367-16,414

It is assumed that the stochastic effects manifest themselves mainly as fluctuation in the transmission coefficient, the death rate and the proportional coefficient of the isolation of infective. It is shown that the extinction and persistence in the mean of the model are determined by a threshold value [Formula: see text]. That is, if [Formula: see text] , then disease dies out with probability one, and if [Formula: see text] , then the disease is stochastic persistent in the means with probability one. Furthermore, the existence of a unique stationary distribution is discussed, and the sufficient conditions are established by using the Lyapunov function method.

The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro) represents a promising target for antiviral therapy. The lack of selectivity for some of the reported 3CLpro inhibitors, specifically versus cathepsin L, raises potential safety and efficacy concerns. ALG-097111 potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (IC50 = 7 nM) without affecting the activity of human cathepsin L (IC50 > 10 μM). When ALG-097111 was dosed in hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2, a robust and significant 3.5 log10 (RNA copies/mg) reduction of the viral RNA copies and 3.7 log10 (TCID50/mg) reduction in the infectious virus titers in the lungs was observed.

Strict preventive measures have been implemented during April and May and then a normalization phase started in our country in June. Our aim is to evaluate the effect of preventive measures during the pandemic process on allergic airway disease symptoms. METHODS: A prospective questionnaire-based study was planned and a questionnaire form was sent to the cell-phones of the subjects with pollen allergy followed in our clinic. Number of airborne grass pollens was determined by Burkard volumetric 7-day spore trap. RESULTS: A total of 222 pollen allergic patients were included in the study. At the beginning of the pandemic, majority of the subjects were spending time mostly indoors. The rate of home-office workers gradually decreased and the rate of office workers and the number of days at work increased from April to June, significantly. Nasal and ocular symptoms of the patients, also increased in June compared to April and May and, approximately one-third of the patients had less symptoms when compared to the same period of the previous year. The rates of using a face mask and taking a shower on return home were high among the subjects during all season. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that spending less time outside during the pollen season and wearing a mask outdoors reduces exposure to pollens and causes a reduction in symptoms. Thus, strict application of measures that cannot be applied in daily practice can make a significant contribution to the management of seasonal allergic rhinitis.","Sözener, Zeynep Çelebi; Öztürk, Betül Özdel; Aydın, Ömür; Demirel, Yavuz Selim; Pınar, Nur Münevver; Bavbek, Sevim; Sin, Betül Ayse; Mungan, Dilşad",Asia Pac Allergy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34007826/; https://doi.org/10.5415/apallergy.2021.11.e16,414

Métodos: Se evaluaron retrospectivamente las tomografías computarizadas de tórax de 182 pacientes con RT-PCR positiva para SARS-CoV-2. En función del tiempo de evolución de la infección, los pacientes fueron clasificados en tres grupos/estadios: fase precoz (0-4 días), intermedia/progresiva (5-9 días) y avanzada (≥10 días). Se analizó la frecuencia de cada hallazgo radiológico, así como el patrón, la apariencia y la distribución predominantes de la afectación pulmonar. La extensión de la afectación pulmonar se estimó para cada lóbulo pulmonar y para el volumen pulmonar total mediante un score tomográfico visual (rango 0-25). Resultados: El hallazgo tomográfico predominante fue el patrón en vidrio deslustrado (n = 110, 60,4%), la distribución más frecuente, la periférica (n = 116, 66,7%) y la apariencia más prevalente, la típica (n = 112, 61,5%). El “signo del halo” se encontró más frecuentemente en la fase precoz (25%), mientras que las opacidades en vidrio deslustrado, el patrón en empedrado y las líneas subpleurales fueron más frecuentes en las fases intermedia/progresiva y avanzada. La mediana del score de gravedad fue de 10 (RIQ: 5-13), aumentando los valores con la progresión de la enfermedad. El acuerdo interobservador (kappa, k) para la apariencia, la distribución y el patrón predominante, así como para el score visual fueron de 0,92; 0,84; 0,70, y 0,89; respectivamente. Conclusión: Los hallazgos tomográficos en la COVID-19 varían con el curso de la infección. El score radiológico sugerido es una herramienta sencilla, reproducible y fiable para evaluar la afectación pulmonar en la neumonía COVID-19. Objective: To compare the findings on chest computed tomography (CT) in patients with COVID-19 during different phases of the disease and to evaluate the reproducibility of a visual radiologic score for estimating the extent of lung involvement. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed chest CT studies from 182 patients with RT-PCR findings positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients were classified according to the time elapsed from the onset of symptoms, as follows: early (0-4 days), intermediate/progressive (5-9 days), or advanced (≥10 days). We analyzed the frequency of each radiologic finding, as well as the pattern, appearance, and predominant distribution of lung involvement. A visual tomographic score (range, 0-25) was used to estimate the extent of involvement in each lobe and in the total lung volume. Results: The predominant CT finding was the ground-glass pattern (n=110; 60.4%), the most common distribution was peripheral (n = 116; 66.7%), and the most prevalent appearance was typical (n=112; 61.5%). The halo sign was seen most frequently in the early phase (25%), whereas ground-glass opacities were more common in the intermediate/progressive and advanced phases. The median severity score was 10 (IQR: 5-13), and the scores increased as the disease progressed. The interobserver agreement (kappa) was 0.92 for the appearance, 0.84 for the distribution, 0.70 for the predominant pattern, and 0.89 for the visual score. Conclusion: The CT findings in patients with COVID-19 vary with the course of the infection. The proposed visual radiologic score is a simple, reproducible, and reliable tool for assessing lung involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia.","Soriano Aguadero, I.; Ezponda Casajús, A.; Mendoza Ferradas, F.; Igual Rouilleault, A.; Paternain Nuin, A.; Pueyo Villoslada, J.; Bastarrika Alemañ, G.",Radiologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rx.2021.02.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33743999/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033833821000655?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033833821000655,414

Several therapies are currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the development of new drugs and the repositioning of existing drugs can only be achieved after the identification of potential therapeutic targets within structures, as this strategy provides the most precise solution for developing treatments for sudden epidemic infectious diseases. SUMMARY: In the current investigation, crystal and cryo-electron microscopy structures encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome were systematically examined for the identification of potential drug targets. These structures include nonstructural proteins (Nsp-9; Nsp-12; and Nsp-15), nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and the main protease (M(pro)). KEY MESSAGE: The structural information reveals the presence of many potential alternative therapeutic targets, primarily involved in interaction between N protein and Nsp3, forming replication-transcription complexes (RTCs) which might be a potential drug target for effective control of current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. RTCs consist of 16 nonstructural proteins (Nsp1-16) that play the most essential role in the synthesis of viral RNA. Targeting the physical linkage between the envelope and single-stranded positive RNA, a process facilitated by matrix proteins may provide a good alternative strategy. Our current study provides useful information for the development of new lead compounds against SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Khan, Muhammad Tahir; Irfan, Muhammad; Ahsan, Hina; Ahmed, Abrar; Kaushik, Aman Chandra; Khan, Anwar Sheed; Chinnasamy, Sathishkumar; Ali, Arif; Wei, Dong-Qing",Intervirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33454715/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000513686,414

The barriers can range from transport accessibility to socio-economic conditions, ethnicity and various patient characteristics. Australia has one of the best healthcare systems in the world; however, there are several concerns surrounding its accessibility, primarily due to the vast geographical area it encompasses. This review study is an attempt to understand the various modeling approaches used by researchers to analyze diverse barriers related to specific disease types and the various areal distributions in the country. In terms of barriers, the most affected people are those living in rural and remote parts, and the situation is even worse for indigenous people. These models have mostly focused on the use of statistical models and spatial modeling. The review reveals that most of the focus has been on cancer-related studies and understanding accessibility among the rural and urban population. Future work should focus on further categorizing the population based on indigeneity, migration status and the use of advanced computational models. This article should not be considered an exhaustive review of every aspect as each section deserves a separate review of its own.

This study assesses alcohol consumption and hazardous drinking behavior during the initial phase of pandemic measures in Norway and identifies potential risk factors. A cross-sectional study (N = 25,708) was conducted in Bergen, Norway, following the first six weeks of strict infection control measures. In a model of self-assessed increased alcohol consumption, logistic regression analysis was conducted with independent variables for COVID-19-related worries, joblessness, quarantine, self-reported drinking behavior, age, gender, and occupational situation. These are reported with odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals. Fifty-one percent of respondents reported economic or health-related worries due to COVID-19, 16% had been in quarantine, 49% worked/studied from home, 54% reported hazardous drinking behavior, and 13% reported increased alcohol consumption. People aged 30–39 years had elevated odds of increased alcohol consumption during lockdown (OR 3.1, 2.4−3.8) compared to the oldest adults. Increased drinking was more frequent among people reporting economic worries (OR 1.6, 1.4−1.8), those quarantined (OR 1.2, 1.1−1.4), and those studying or working at home (OR 1.4, 1.3−1.6). More than half of respondents reported hazardous drinking behavior. Increased alcohol consumption during lockdown was common among people with economic worries, people in quarantine, and people studying or working at home.

Despite recent advances in therapies, the overall 5-year survival rate of LC remains less than 20%. The efficacy of current therapeutic approaches is compromised by inherent or acquired drug-resistance and severe off-target effects. Therefore, the identification and development of innovative and effective therapeutic approaches are critically desired for LC. The development of RNA-mediated gene inhibition technologies was a turning point in the field of RNA biology. The critical regulatory role of different RNAs in multiple cancer pathways makes them a rich source of targets and innovative tools for developing anticancer therapies. The identification of antisense sequences, short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), anti-miRs, and mRNA-based platforms holds great promise in preclinical and early clinical evaluation against LC. In the last decade, RNA-based therapies have substantially expanded and tested in clinical trials for multiple malignancies, including LC.

Dialysis has additional contributions on transmission risk so prompt preventive strategies were implemented for dialysis patients. We aimed to evaluate pandemic‐related perceptions and concerns of dialysis patients and differences between dialysis modalities. MATERIAL‐METHOD: An anonymous survey for assessing concerns, knowledge, and attitudes about the pandemic was sent online to a total of 339 patients on maintenance dialysis at 4 tertiary dialysis centers in Turkey. A total of 309 patients (54.9±15.1 years, 51.6% females, 55.7% in‐center hemodialysis, 44.3% peritoneal dialysis) enrolled. The anonymous online survey was conducted at the end of April 2020. RESULTS: HD patients were more concerned about transmission risk (P=0.002) and risks associated with the dialysis treatment environment and the transport methods (P< 0.001). The total concern score was significantly higher in the HD group (2.60±0.93 vs. 1.65±0.54, P<0.001). The knowledge about the pandemic and prevention methods and the attitudes of prevention were similar between the groups (P= 0.161 and 0.418, respectively). The compliance rate of personal preventive strategies was 98.1%. Considering changing the current dialysis modality due to the pandemic was higher in the HD group (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Although the preventive strategies were performed properly in the HD centers, HD patients were more concerned about the Covid‐19 outbreak compared with PD.

Thereby, assessing and widening access to sustainable, durable water and sanitation infrastructure remains a global health issue. Rural areas are already at a disadvantage. Poor access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) can have a major negative effect on students in rural schools. Thus, the paper aims to assess the current condition and the challenge to access WASH in rural Kazakh schools. The study was conducted in three rural schools in Central Kazakhstan. Data were gathered through a survey among pupils, observations of the WASH infrastructure and maintenance, and a face-to-face interview with school administrators. The mean survey response rate was 65% across schools. Results indicated there was no alternative drinking-water source in schools, and 15% of students said they had access to water only occasionally. Half of the students reported that the water was unsafe to drink because of a poor odor, taste, or color. The toilet in school 3 was locked with a key, and a quarter of the students reported there was no access to a key. Moreover, not having gender-separated toilet facilities was a challenge because of the traditional gender norms. Despite the effective regulations and measures of handwashing taken during COVID-19, 27.7% of the students answered that soap was not offered daily in classrooms. Additionally, warm water was only provided in school 2. About 75% of students did not have access to drying materials continuously.

623804,Identification of Highly Conserved SARS-CoV-2 Antigenic Epitopes with Wide Coverage Using Reverse Vaccinology Approach,2021-04-28,"Background SARS-CoV-2 infection, the causative agent of COVID-19, has resulted in over 2,500,000 deaths to date1. Although vaccines are becoming available, treatment options remain limited. Repurposing of compounds could reduce the time, cost, and risks associated with the development of new drugs and has been the focus of many clinical studies. Here, we summarise available evidence on 29 FDA-approved compounds, from in vitro results to clinical trials, focussing on remdesivir, galidesivir and favipiravir, and test 29 antiviral compounds’ activity in vitro. Methods A comprehensive search strategy was used to retrieve trials and publications related to antiviral compounds with potential efficacy to treat coronaviruses. These data were used to prioritise testing of a panel of antiviral drugs in vitro against patient isolates of SARS-CoV-2. An in vitro screen was carried out to determine the activity of 29 FDA-approved compounds. Results 625 clinical trials investigated 16 repurposed antiviral candidate compounds for the treatment of COVID-19. In vitro studies identified ten drug candidates with demonstrable anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, including favipiravir, remdesivir, and galidesivir. To validate these findings, a drug screen was conducted using two cell lines and wildtype isolates of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from patients in the UK. While eight drugs with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity were identified in vitro, activity in clinical trials has, as yet failed to demonstrate a strong effect on mortality. Conclusions So far, no repurposed antiviral has shown a strong effect on mortality in clinical studies. The urgent need for novel antivirals in this pandemic is clear, despite the costs and time associated with their development. Research in Context Evidence before this study Repurposing of existing compounds for the treatment of COVID-19 has been the focus of many in vitro studies and clinical trials, saving time, costs and risks associated with the research and development of new compounds. Added value of this study We reviewed the literature for 29 FDA-approved compounds with previously reported (or suspected) anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and found 625 clinical trials that have been undertaken on 16 different drugs. We determined if repurposed antivirals are suitable for clinical trials based on previously published data, and conducted an additional in vitro screen using locally circulating strains in the UK (PHE2 and GLA1). We report the difference in IC50 from published data using Wuhan1/Wash1 strains with PHE2 and GLA1, including IC50 values below 100μM for galidesivir in wild-type virus. Given the limited success of repurposed compounds in the treatment of COVID-19, we comment on the urgent need for new antivirals specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2. Implications of all the available evidence Our data show that most prospective compounds for repurposing show no anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, and antiviral activity in vitro does not always translate to clinical benefit. So far, no repurposed compound has shown a strong effect on mortality in clinical studies. Drugs, including monoclonal antibody therapies, that have been developed to target SARS-CoV-2 virus itself have shown most promise.","Kovacs, Dory; Davis, Chris; Cannon, Paul; McFarlane, Melanie; Rainey, Stephanie M; Pinto, Rute; Stewart, Meredith E; Szemiel, Agnieszka M; Taggart, Aislynn; Kohl, Alain; Marra, Fiona; Thomson, Emma C; Scott, Janet T",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.25.436935,414

624505,Correction to “Synergistic Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Replication Using Disulfiram/Ebselen and Remdesivir”,2021-04-29,"The ongoing Coronavirus crisis forced both the Berufsfachschule für Notfallsanitäter (emergency paramedic vocational school) of the Munich fire department and all other German schools to quit classroom teaching within just a few days. Similarly, all practical trainings at clinics and on ambulances had to be put on hold. As the apprentices’ training objective was acutely endangered by the expected lengthy teaching downtimes, it was of crucial importance to successfully establish homeschooling. While members of our teaching staff were additionally bound by support for the Munich crisis unit, the switch to virtual classroom teaching for all ongoing courses significantly increased the overall workload of the staff. In a first step, we established a fast video and communication platform via Microsoft Skype. All other issues had to be solved on the fly due to the lack of preparation time. Soon it became obvious that using only classic upfront teaching methods was not an option due to the resulting monotony of a full-time 35 h training week. Additionally, we had to ensure that exams would also be possible during homeschooling to avoid the accumulation of missing performance assessments. Within a few days, it became clear that almost all forms of social interactions and teaching methods could be integrated into the virtual classroom with minor limitations. A survey among students showed that while homeschooling cannot fully replace classroom teaching, it is considered a good alternative in emergency situations. Furthermore, many trainees think that homeschooling could be a valuable addition to normal classroom teaching. Maybe this crisis could turn out to be the beginning of a new complementary teaching strategy.","Frieß, C.; Bayerl, T.",Notf Rett Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412532/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10049-020-00709-4,414

Current treatment guidelines support use of remdesivir as well as dexamethasone in hypoxic patients. There is very little information known about use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in combination with the other two medications. Methods and outcomes We report our experience among six coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients who received ICS, remdesivir and dexamethasone for treatment as well as their outcomes. Data were obtained from retrospective chart review during a two-week period from July 8, 2020 to July 22, 2020. Five patients were treated successfully and discharged home. One patient expired. Conclusions This case series highlights the possible benefits of inhaled steroids in treatment of COVID-19 patients with hypoxia. Further randomized controlled studies are needed to assess inhaled corticosteroids as possible treatment either alone or in combination with systemic steroids for treating COVID-19 patients.

Whether thyroid function and autoimmunity play a role is uncertain. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of LC and the potential role of thyroid function and autoimmunity in LC. METHODS: We included consecutive adults without known thyroid disorder, admitted to a major COVID-19 centre for confirmed COVID-19 from July to December 2020 who had thyroid function tests (TFTs) and anti-thyroid antibodies measured on admission and at follow-up. LC was defined by the presence or persistence of symptoms upon follow-up. RESULTS: In total, 204 patients (median age: 55.0 years; 46.6% men) were reassessed at a median of 89 days (IQR: 69–99) after acute COVID-19. Forty-one (20.1%) had LC. Female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.48, p=0.018) and SARS-CoV-2 PCR cycle threshold value <25 on admission (aOR 2.84, p=0.012) independently predicted the occurrence of LC. Upon follow-up, most abnormal TFTs in acute COVID-19 resolved, and incident thyroid dysfunction was rare. Nonetheless, we observed incident anti-TPO (anti-thyroid peroxidase) positivity. While baseline or follow-up TFTs were not associated with the occurrence of LC, among 172 patients symptomatic in acute COVID-19, symptom resolution was more likely in those with positive anti-TPO upon follow-up (p=0.043). CONCLUSION: LC is common among COVID-19 survivors, with female and those with higher viral load in acute COVID-19 particularly vulnerable. The observation of incident anti-TPO positivity warrants further follow-up for thyroid dysfunction. Whether anti-TPO plays a protective role in LC remains to be elucidated.","Lui, David Tak Wai; Lee, Chi Ho; Chow, Wing Sun; Lee, Alan Chun Hong; Tam, Anthony Raymond; Pang, Polly; Ho, Tip Yin; Fong, Carol Ho Yi; Law, Chun Yiu; Leung, Eunice Ka Hong; To, Kelvin Kai Wang; Tan, Kathryn Choon Beng; Woo, Yu Cho; Lam, Ching Wan; Hung, Ivan Fan Ngai; Lam, Karen Siu Ling",Endocr Pract,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eprac.2021.06.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1530891X21011113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34237471/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1530891X21011113?v=s5,414

Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the identified CBoV strains was conducted using nucleotide sequences of the partial NS1 gene. The results indicated that 15 of 201 fecal samples (7.5%) were positive for CBoV; the partial NS1 genes of the 15 CBoV strains exhibited 83.1%–100% nucleotide identity, and 75.8%–100% amino acid identity; the entire VP2 gene of five selected CBoV strains exhibited 82.9%–96.8% nucleotide identity, and 90.4%–99.1% amino acid identity. The 15 CBoV strains exhibited high co-infection rates with CPV-2 (40%), CCoV (20%), and CaKV (26.67%). Phylogenetic analysis of the partial NS1 gene revealed that the 15 CBoV strains were divided into different subgroups of CBoV-2 when compared with CBoV-2 strains from South Korea, USA, Germany, and Hong Kong in China. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of the VP2 gene indicated that five selected CBoV strains were divided into three different genetic groups of CBoV-2, involving in CBoV-2HK group, CBoV-2C group, and CBoV-2B group. The recombination analysis using the entire VP2 gene revealed three potential recombination events that occurred among five selected strains in our study.

This study aimed to identify common transcriptional signatures, regulators and pathways between COVID-19 and DM. We have integrated human whole-genome transcriptomic datasets from COVID-19 and DM, followed by functional assessment with gene ontology (GO) and pathway analyses. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), among the upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 32 were found to be commonly modulated in COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes (T2D), while 10 DEGs were commonly downregulated. As regards type 1 diabetes (T1D), 21 DEGs were commonly upregulated, and 29 DEGs were commonly downregulated in COVID-19 and T1D. Moreover, 35 DEGs were commonly upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected pancreas organoids and T2D islets, while 14 were commonly downregulated. Several GO terms were found in common between COVID-19 and DM. Prediction of the putative transcription factors involved in the upregulation of genes in COVID-19 and DM identified RELA to be implicated in both PBMCs and pancreas.

The recent surge in multidrug-resistant bacteria and the possibility of widespread global virus pandemics necessitate the need for additional preventative and therapeutic options to conventional drugs. Research indicates that pomegranates and their extracts may serve as natural alternatives due to their potency against a wide range of bacterial and viral pathogens. Nearly every part of the pomegranate plant has been tested for antimicrobial activities, including the fruit juice, peel, arils, flowers, and bark. Many studies have utilized pomegranate peel with success. There are various phytochemical compounds in pomegranate that have demonstrated antimicrobial activity, but most of the studies have found that ellagic acid and larger hydrolyzable tannins, such as punicalagin, have the highest activities. In some cases the combination of the pomegranate constituents offers the most benefit. The positive clinical results on pomegranate and suppression of oral bacteria are intriguing and worthy of further study. Much of the evidence for pomegranates' antibacterial and antiviral activities against foodborne pathogens and other infectious disease organisms comes from in vitro cell-based assays, necessitating further confirmation of in vivo efficacy through human clinical trials.","Howell, Amy B.; D'Souza, Doris H.",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/606212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23762148/,414

REPORT OF THE CASE: 50-year-old woman with no significant past medical history who presented with one day of petechial rash on her arms, chest and legs. Patient reports that she had just completed a 7- day course of TMP/SMX (1-double strength tablet twice a day) for uncomplicated UTI by her PMD. On admission, the patient was hemodynamically stable, and complete blood cell count revealed a platelet count of 2000/uL. TMP/SMX was believed to be the most likely cause of thrombocytopenia. After discontinuation of TMP/SMX and treatment with 2 units of platelets, 1gm intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and oral dexamethasone, repeat CBC showed a stable platelet count of 90,000/uL. Patient was successfully discharged on hospital day 3 with outpatient follow up with the hematology clinic for further monitoring. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION: Differential diagnosis of severe thrombocytopenia include drug induced thrombocytopenia (DITP), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), post transfusion purpura (PTP), immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), or catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). Drug-dependent antibodies are an unusual class of antibodies that bind firmly to specific epitopes on platelet surface glycoproteins only in the presence of the sensitizing drugs. DITP typically has an abrupt onset of severe thrombocytopenia, usually less than 20,000/uL. Thrombocytopenia usually begins to recover within 1-2 days after the offending drug is discontinued and platelet levels usually normalize within one week as demonstrated in our case report. Pharmacological treatment can include platelet transfusions in case of severe, overt bleeding, corticosteroids or IVIG administration.

629372,Orally delivered MK-4482 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in the Syrian hamster model,2021-04-16,"Hazardous waste management is of paramount importance due to the potential threats posed to the environment and local residents. The design of a hazardous waste management system involves several important decisions, i.e., the determination of the locations and sizes of treatment, recycling and disposal facilities, and organizing the transportation of hazardous waste among different facilities. In this paper, we proposed a novel stochastic bi-objective mixed integer linear program (MILP) to support these decisions in order to reduce the population exposure to risk while simultaneously maintaining a high cost efficiency of the transportation and treatment of hazardous waste. Moreover, considering the inherent uncertainty within the planning horizon, the cost, demand and affected population are defined as stochastic parameters. A sample average approximation based goal programming (SAA-GP) approach is used to solve the mathematical model. The proposed model and solution method are validated through numerical experiments whose results show that uncertainty may not only affect the objective value but also lead to different strategic decisions in the network design of a hazardous waste management system. In this regard, the strategic decisions obtained by the stochastic model is more robust to the change of external environment. Finally, the model is applied in a real-world case study of healthcare waste management in Wuhan, China, in order to show its applicability.","Yu, Hao; Sun, Xu; Solvang, Wei Deng; Laporte, Gilbert; Man Lee, Carman Ka",J Clean Prod,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959652620336118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834570/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620336118?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123566,414

METHODS: This study is a quasi-experiment study. The study population was patients who visited all 402 EDs in Korea between December 31, 2019 and May 13, 2020, using the National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS) database. The study period was classified into 5 phases according to the level of national crisis warning of infectious disease and the implementation of emergency care-related health policies, and all study phases were 27 days. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcome was length of stay (LOS) in the ED during the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: The number of ED visits during the study period was 2,636,341, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 1.4%. The number of ED visits decreased from 803,160 in phase 1 to 496,619 in phase 5 during the study period. For in-hospital mortality, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval) was 0.77 (0.74–0.79) in phase 5 compared to phase 3. Additionally, by subgroup, the ORs were 0.69 (0.57–0.83) for the patients with acute myocardial infarction and 0.76 (0.67–0.87) for severe trauma in phase 5 compared to phase 3. The ED LOS increased while the number of ED visits decreased as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, and the ED LOS declined after policy implementation (beta coefficient: −5.3 [−6.5 to −4.2] minutes in phase 5 compared to phase 3). CONCLUSION: Implementing appropriate emergency care policies in the COVID-19 pandemic would have contributed to improving the safety of all emergency patients and reducing in-hospital mortality by preventing excessive deaths.","Pak, Yun-Suk; Ro, Young Sun; Kim, Se-Hyung; Han, So-Hyun; Ko, Sung-keun; Kim, Taehui; Kwak, Young Ho; Heo, Tag; Moon, Sungwoo",J Korean Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33904264/,414

There has been no systematic evaluation of HCW stigmatization during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Non-HCW adults from the United States and Canada (N = 3551) completed an online survey, including measures of HCW stigmatization, COVID Stress Syndrome, and avoidance. Results Over a quarter of respondents believed that HCWs should have severe restrictions placed on their freedoms, such as being kept in isolation from their communities and their families. Over a third of respondents avoided HCWs for fear of infection. Participation in altruistic support of HCWs (i.e., evening clapping and cheering) was unrelated to stigmatizing attitudes. Demographic variables had small or trivial correlations with HCW stigmatization. People who stigmatized HCWs also tended to avoid other people, avoid drug stores and supermarkets, and avoid leaving their homes. Factor analysis suggested that HCW stigmatization is linked to the COVID Stress Syndrome. Conclusion Fear and avoidance of HCWs is a widespread, under-recognized problem during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is associated with the COVID Stress Syndrome and might be reduced by interventions targeting this syndrome.","Taylor, Steven; Landry, Caeleigh A.; Rachor, Geoffrey S.; Paluszek, Michelle M.; Asmundson, Gordon J.G.",J Anxiety Disord,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887618520301031?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32853884/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0887618520301031; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102289,414

Targeted quarantine can reduce the amount of indiscriminate social distancing needed to control transmission. Finding the optimal balance between targeted versus broad-scale policies can be operationalized by minimizing the total amount of social isolation needed to achieve a target reproductive number. Optimality is achieved by quarantining on the basis of a risk threshold that depends strongly on current disease prevalence, suggesting that very different disease control policies should be used at different times or places. Aggressive quarantine is warranted given low disease prevalence, while populations with a higher base rate of infection should rely more on social distancing by all. The total value of a quarantine policy rises as case counts fall, is relatively insensitive to vaccination unless the vaccinated are exempt from distancing policies, and is substantially increased by the availability of modestly more information about individual risk of infectiousness.","Petrie, James; Masel, Joanna",J R Soc Interface,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2021.0459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34493093/,414

During the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there have been increasing reports of bacterial and fungal coinfections among some COVID-19 patients with preexisting comorbid illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension, with mucormycosis being one of them. The management of this dreaded fungal infection demands early and prompt surgical intervention to thoroughly remove the infected tissue and necrotic material to reduce the tissue burden of this invasive organism. This should be accompanied by expeditious initiation of amphotericin B along with supportive therapy. Here we present five cases of rhino-orbital mucormycosis in patients with COVID-19, all of whom presented with orbital and facial swelling (three had symptoms of impending blindness) under the backdrop of COVID-19 symptoms in the form of intermittent fever and slight dyspnea. Our treatment strategy comprised an expeditious use of early surgical intervention and amphotericin B along with the control of cytokine storm and hyperglycemia.

The HAVEN studies addressed bleeding reduction in emicizumab-treated patients, but real-world data on bleeding patterns during emicizumab therapy are lacking. We aimed to compare the occurrence of breakthrough bleeding at different time points, starting from emicizumab initiation. This longitudinal prospective observational cohort study included HA patients (n = 70, aged 1 month to 74.9 years) that completed at least 18 months of follow-up in our center. We analyzed the number of spontaneous and traumatic bleeds during selected time points of the study (“bleeding periods”). The percentage of traumatic and spontaneous bleeding episodes was not significantly different among “bleeding periods” (P = 0.053 and P = 0.092, respectively). Most trauma-related treated bleeds resulted from either hemarthrosis (53%) or head trauma (33%). Spontaneous bleeding episodes were mostly hemarthroses (80%). Potential associations of the patients’ age, annualized bleeding rate before emicizumab treatment, and the presence of inhibitors with spontaneous bleed occurrence were analyzed with binomial logistic regression. The odds of bleeding while on emicizumab increased by a factor of 1.029 (P = 0.034) for every one year of age. Conclusions: Our real-world data revealed that the risk of bleeding persists, especially in older patients, despite therapy with emicizumab. These data may help clinicians in counselling their patients and in planning their management.","Levy-Mendelovich, Sarina; Brutman-Barazani, Tami; Budnik, Ivan; Avishai, Einat; Barg, Assaf A.; Levy, Tamara; Misgav, Mudi; Livnat, Tami; Kenet, Gili",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34640320/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10194303,414

Herein, we critically summarize the latest efforts to develop antiviral surface coatings that exhibit virus-inactivating functions through disrupting lipid envelopes or protein capsids. Particular attention is focused on how cutting-edge advances in material science are being applied to engineer antiviral surface coatings with tailored molecular-level properties to inhibit membrane-enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Key topics covered include surfaces functionalized with organic and inorganic compounds and nanoparticles to inhibit viruses, and self-cleaning surfaces that incorporate photocatalysts and triplet photosensitizers. Application examples to stop COVID-19 are also introduced and demonstrate how the integration of chemical design principles and advanced material fabrication strategies are leading to next-generation surface coatings that can help thwart viral pandemics and other infectious disease threats.","Wang, Nan; Ferhan, Abdul Rahim; Yoon, Bo Kyeong; Jackman, Joshua A; Cho, Nam-Joon; Majima, Tetsuro",Chem Soc Rev,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1cs00317h; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34259262/,414

In addition, SARS-CoV-2–seropositive subjects were more often identified among those living in houses with a latrine (P = 0.002). Latrines have almost five times the odds of containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA than their paired flushing toilets. Latrines are reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and it cannot be ruled out that latrines could contribute to viral transmission in rural settings.

We aimed to investigate the correlation between chest CT and clinical features in COVID-19 suspected patients with or without fever. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 211 COVID-19 suspected patients who underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR in Wuhan, China. The performance of CT in patients having relevant onset symptoms with fever (n=141) and without fever (n=70) were assessed respectively. RESULTS: The sensitivity of CT for COVID-19 was 97.3% with AUC of 0.71 (95% CI 0.66-0.76). There were 141 suspected patients with fever and 70 without fever. In fever group, four variables were screened to establish the basic model: age, monocyte, red blood cell, and hypertension. The AUC of basic model was 0.72 (95% CI 0.63-0.81) while CT-aided model was 0.77 (95% CI 0.68-0.85), with significantly difference (P＜0.05). In non-fever group, only dry cough was screened out to establish the basic model, AUC was 0.76 (95% CI 0.64-0.88), which made no significantly difference than CT-aided model (P=0.08).

634194,Engineered ACE2 receptor therapy overcomes mutational escape of SARS-CoV-2,2021-06-21,"Background & Aims: Celiac disease is a gluten-induced enteropathy characterized by the presence of gliadin-specific CD4(+) T cells in the lamina propria and by a prominent intraepithelial T-cell infiltration of unknown mechanism. The aim of this study was to characterize the subset(s) of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) expanding during active celiac disease to provide insights into the mechanisms involved in their expansion. Methods: Flow-cytometric analysis of isolated IELs and/or immunohistochemical staining of frozen sections were performed in 51 celiac patients and 50 controls with a panel of monoclonal antibodies against T-cell and natural killer (NK) receptors. In addition, in vitro studies were performed to identify candidate stimuli for NK receptor expression. Results: In normal intestine, different proportions of IELs, which were mainly T cells, expressed the NK receptors CD94/NKG2, NKR-P1A, KIR2D/3D, NKp46, Pen5, or CD56. During the active phase of celiac disease, the frequency of CD94(+) IELs, which were mostly αβ T cells, was conspicuously increased over controls. In contrast, the expression of other NK markers was not modified. Furthermore, expression of CD94 could be selectively induced in vitro by T-cell receptor activation and/or interleukin 15, a cytokine produced by intestinal epithelial cells. Conclusions: The gut epithelium favors the development of T cells that express NK receptors. In active celiac disease, there is a specific and selective increase of IELs expressing CD94, the HLA-E–specific NK receptor that may be related to T-cell receptor activation and/or interleukin 15 secretion.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical impact of COVID-19 infection on outcome and oncologic treatment of cancer patients. PATIENT AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled cancer patients with laboratory and/or radiologic confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, admitted to our center from February to April 2020. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the clinical data and univariate analyses were performed to investigate the impact of anticancer treatment modifications due to COVID-19 outbreak on the short-term overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Among 61 patients enrolled, 49 (80%) were undergoing anticancer treatment and 41 (67%) had metastatic disease. Most patients were men; median age was 68 years. Median OS was 46.6 days (40% of deaths occurred within 20 days from COVID-19 diagnosis). Among 59 patients with available data on therapeutic course, 46 experienced consequences on their anticancer treatment schedule. Interruption or a starting failure of the oncologic therapy correlated with significant shorter OS. Anticancer treatment delays did not negatively affect the OS. Lymphocytopenia development after COVID was significantly associated with worst outcome. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 diagnosis in cancer patients may affect their short-term OS, especially in case of interruption/starting failure of cancer therapy.

Although health care workers (HCWs) are essential to the health system response, there are few studies exploring HCW attitudes to pandemic influenza. The aim of this study was to explore HCWs knowledge, attitudes and intended behaviour towards pandemic influenza. METHODS: Cross-sectional investigation of a convenience sample of clinical and non-clinical HCWs from two tertiary-referral teaching hospitals in Sydney, Australia was conducted between June 4 and October 19, 2007. The self-administered questionnaire was distributed to hospital personal from 40 different wards and departments. The main outcome measures were intentions regarding work attendance and quarantine, antiviral use and perceived preparation. RESULTS: Respondents were categorized into four main groups by occupation: Nursing (47.5%), Medical (26.0%), Allied (15.3%) and Ancillary (11.2%). Our study found that most HCWs perceived pandemic influenza to be very serious (80.9%, n = 873) but less than half were able to correctly define it (43.9%, n = 473). Only 24.8% of respondents believed their department to be prepared for a pandemic, but nonetheless most were willing to work during a pandemic if a patient or colleague had influenza. The main determinants of variation in our study were occupational factors, demographics and health beliefs. Non-clinical staff were significantly most likely to be unsure of their intentions (OR 1.43, p < 0.001). Only 42.5% (n = 459) of respondents considered that neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications (oseltamivir/zanamivir) would protect them against pandemic influenza, whereas 77.5% (n = 836) believed that vaccination would be of benefit. CONCLUSION: We identified two issues that could undermine the best of pandemic plans – the first, a low level of confidence in antivirals as an effective measure; secondly, that non-clinical workers are an overlooked group whose lack of knowledge and awareness could undermine pandemic plans. Other issues included a high level of confidence in dietary measures to protect against influenza, and a belief among ancillary workers that antibiotics would be protective. All health care worker strategies should include non clinical and ancillary staff to ensure adequate business continuity for hospitals. HCW education, psychosocial support and staff communication could improve knowledge of appropriate pandemic interventions and confidence in antivirals.","Seale, Holly; Leask, Julie; Po, Kieren; MacIntyre, C Raina",BMC Health Serv Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-9-30; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19216792/,414

Innovative strategies to address obstacles included pandemic-electronic benefits transfer (EBT), bus-stop delivery, community pick-up locations, batched meals and leveraging partner resources. CONCLUSIONS: A focus on fresher, more appealing meals and greater communication between school officials and parents could boost participation. Districts that leveraged external partnerships were better equipped to provide meals during pandemic conditions. In addition, policies increasing access to fresh foods and capitalising on United States Department of Agriculture waivers could boost school meal participation. Finally, partnering with community organisations and acting upon parent feedback could improve school meal systems, and in combination with pandemic-EBT, address childhood food insecurity.","Jowell, Ashley H; Bruce, Janine S; Escobar, Gabriela V; Ordonez, Valeria M; Hecht, Christina A; Patel, Anisha I",Public Health Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34325769/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s1368980021003141,414

In light of such high-demand circumstances, we describe an open web-accessible simulation-based decision support tool for a better use of finite hospital resources. The aim is to explore risk and reward under differing assumptions with a model that diverges from most existing models which focus on epidemic curves and related demand of ward and intensive care beds in general. While maintaining intuitive use, our tool allows randomized “what-if” scenarios which are key for real-time experimentation and analysis of current decisions’ down-stream effects on required but finite resources over self-selected time horizons. While the implementation is for COVID-19, the approach generalizes to other diseases and high-demand circumstances.","Brüggemann, Sven; Chan, Theodore; Wardi, Gabriel; Mandel, Jess; Fontanesi, John; Bitmead, Robert R.",Inform Med Unlocked,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2021.100618; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914821001088?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34095453/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352914821001088,414
637587,Functionalized TiO2 nanotube-based Electrochemical Biosensor for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2,2020-09-09,"BACKGROUND: Health care workers (HCWs) can acquire and transmit influenza to their patients and coworkers, even while asymptomatic. The U.S. Healthy People 2010 initiative set a national goal of 60% coverage for HCW influenza vaccination by 2010. Yet vaccination rates remain low. In the 2008–2009 influenza season, Flushing Hospital Medical Center (FHMC; New York) adopted a “push/pull” point-of-dispensing (POD) vaccination model that was derived from emergency preparedness planning for mass vaccination and/or prophylaxis to respond to an infectious disease outbreak, whether occurring naturally or due to bioterrorism. LAUNCH OF THE HCW VACCINATION PROGRAM: In mid-September 2008, a two-week HCW vaccination program was launched using a sequential POD approach. In Push POD, teams assigned to specific patient units educated all HCWs about influenza vaccination and offered on-site vaccination; vaccinated HCWs received a 2009 identification (ID) validation sticker. In Pull POD, HCWs could enter the hospital only through one entrance; all other employee entrances were “locked down.” A 2009 ID validation sticker was required for entry and to punch in for duty. Employees without the new validation sticker were directed to a nearby vaccination team. After the Push/Pull POD was completed, the employee vaccination drive at FHMC was continued for the remainder of the influenza season by the Employee Health Service. RESULTS: Using this model, in two days 72% of the employees were reached, with 54% of those reached accepting vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: This model provides a novel approach for institutions to improve their HCW influenza vaccination rates within a limited period through exercising emergency preparedness plans for infectious disease outbreaks.","Crupi, Robert S.; Di John, David; Mangubat, Peter Michael; Asnis, Deborah; Devera, Jaime; Maguire, Paul; Palevsky, Sheila L.",Jt Comm J Qual Patient Saf,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1553725010360739; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1553725010360739; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21090019/,414

We hypothesised that the early, strict lockdown which severely limited the movements of individuals in Uganda will have impacted access to services. Methods: An observational study, using routinely collected health data from Electronic Medical Records was carried out, utilising data from July 2019 to December 2020 in Kawempe district, Kampala. The mean and 95% confidence intervals were calculated pre-COVID (July 2019-February 2020) and post-COVID (March-December 2020). The means were compared using t-tests, and the monthly totals analysed as to whether they lay within or outside the normal range, compared to the previous 9 months. Results: Antenatal attendances decreased 96% in April 2020 and remain below pre-COVID levels. We found a rise in adverse pregnancy outcomes for Caesarean sections (5%), haemorrhages related to pregnancy (51%), stillbirths (31%) and low-birth-weight (162%) and premature infant births (400%). We noted a drop in neonatal unit admissions, immunisation clinic attendance and delivery of all vaccinations except measles. There was an immediate drop in clinic attendance for prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (now stabilised) and an increase of 348% in childhood malnutrition clinic attendance. Maternal and neonatal deaths, immediate post-natal care and contraceptive provision remained within normal limits. Conclusion: The response to COVID-19 in Uganda has negatively impacted maternal, child and neonatal health, with the biggest and longest lasting impact seen in complications of pregnancy, stillbirths and low-birthweight infants likely due to delayed care-seeking behaviour. The decline in vaccination clinic attendance has implications for all vaccine-preventable diseases, with a cohort of infants currently unprotected. Further consideration of the impacts of restricting movement and limiting access to preventative services must be undertaken in responding to future pandemics if key maternal and child health services are to be maintained.","Burt, J.

The coherenc e between the level, slope, and the curvature of the sovereign yield term structures and the Covid-19 medi a coverage is found to vary between low and high ranges, depending on the phases of the pandemic. The empirical estimations of the yield-curve factors a re performed by means of the Diebold–Li modified version of the Nelson–Siegel model. The intervals of low coherence reveal the capacity of the two latent factors, level and slope, to be used for creating cross-factor diversification strategies, workable under crisis conditions, as evidenced on the example of the ongoing pandemic. Diverse coherence patterns are reported on a per-country basis, highlighting a promising potential of sovereign debt investments for designing cross-country and cross-factor fixed-income strategies, capable of hedging downside risks.","Umar, Zaghum; Gubareva, Mariya; Sokolova, Tatiana",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34197524/,414

Crude estimates of these quantities suffer from dependence on the underlying testing strategies within communities. We clarify the functional relationship between testing and the epidemic parameters, and thereby derive sensitivity analyses that explore the range of possible truths under various testing dynamics. We derive the required adjustment to the estimates of interest for New York City.

METHOD: We used the health belief model, which explores four dimensions: perceived susceptibility (five questions), perceived severity (five questions), perceived benefits (five questions), and perceived barriers (five questions). Additionally, we included a fifth dimension, called pro-health motivation (four questions). The questions composed an electronic questionnaire disseminated by social networks for an one-week period. Answers were quantitative values of subjective representations, obtained by a psychophysically constructed scale with verbal anchors ratio (CentiMax (®) ). Mean time for total filling was 12 minutes (standard deviation = 1.6). RESULTS: We obtained 277 complete responses to the form. One was excluded because it belonged to a participant under 18 years old. Reproducibility measures were significant for 22 of the 24 questions in our questionnaire (Cronbach’s α = 0.883). Convergent validity was attested by Spearman-Brown’s split half reliability coefficient (r = 0.882). Significant differences among groups were more intense in perceived susceptibility and severity dimensions, and less in perceived benefits and barriers. CONCLUSION: Our health belief model-based questionnaire using quantitative measures enabled the confirmation of popular beliefs about covid-19 infection risks. The advantage in our approach lays in the possibility of quickly, directly and quantitatively identifying individual belief profiles for each dimension in the questionnaire, serving as a great ally for communication processes and public health education.","Costa, Marcelo Fernandes",Revista de saude publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32491096/; https://doi.org/10.11606/s1518-8787.2020054002494,414

Nsp5 is the main protease (M(pro)) responsible for cleavage at eleven positions along these polyproteins, including at its own N- and C-terminal boundaries, representing essential processing events for subsequent viral assembly and maturation. We have determined X-ray crystallographic structures of this cysteine protease in its wild-type free active site state at 1.8 Å resolution, in its acyl-enzyme intermediate state with the native C-terminal autocleavage sequence at 1.95 Å resolution and in its product bound state at 2.0 Å resolution by employing an active site mutation (C145A). We characterize the stereochemical features of the acyl-enzyme intermediate including critical hydrogen bonding distances underlying catalysis in the Cys/His dyad and oxyanion hole. We also identify a highly ordered water molecule in a position compatible for a role as the deacylating nucleophile in the catalytic mechanism and characterize the binding groove conformational changes and dimerization interface that occur upon formation of the acyl-enzyme.

Non-pharmaceutical interventions adopted by Sweden have been milder compared to those implemented in Denmark. Moreover, Sweden might have started the pandemic with a large proportion of vulnerable elderly with a high mortality risk. This study aimed to clarify whether excess mortality in Sweden can be explained by a large stock of 'dry tinder' instead of being attributed to faulty lockdown policies. METHODS We analysed weekly death counts in Sweden and Denmark from July 2007 to June 2020. We used a novel method for short-term mortality forecasting to estimate expected and excess deaths during the first COVID-19 wave in Sweden and Denmark. RESULTS In the first part of the epiyear 2019-2020, deaths were low in both Sweden and Denmark. In the absence of COVID-19, a relatively low level of death would be expected for the later part of the epiyear. The registered deaths were, however, way above the upper bound of the prediction interval in Sweden and within the range in Denmark. CONCLUSIONS 'Dry tinder' can only account for a modest fraction of excess Swedish mortality. The risk of death during the first COVID-19 wave rose significantly for Swedish women aged >85 but only slightly for Danish women aged >85. The risk discrepancy seems more likely to result from differences between Sweden and Denmark in how care and housing for the elderly are organised, coupled with a less successful Swedish strategy of shielding the elderly.","Rizzi, Silvia; Søgaard, Jes; Vaupel, James W",Scandinavian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/14034948211027818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34213362/,414

A potential solution to improve population health includes the adoption of care delivery models that alleviate unmet needs through screening, referral, and tracking of patients in health care settings, yet the overall impact of such models has remained unexplored. This review addresses an existing gap in the literature regarding the effectiveness of these models and assesses their overall impact on outcomes related to experience of care, population health, and costs. METHODS: In March 2020, we searched for peer-reviewed articles published in PubMed over the past 10 years. Studies were included if they 1) used a screening tool for identifying unmet health-related social needs in a health care setting, 2) referred patients with positive screens to appropriate resources for addressing identified unmet health-related social needs, and 3) reported any outcomes related to patient experience of care, population health, or cost. RESULTS: Of 1,821 articles identified, 35 met the inclusion criteria. All but 1 study demonstrated a tendency toward high risk of bias. Improved outcomes related to experience of care (eg, change in social needs, patient satisfaction, n = 34), population health (eg, diet quality, blood cholesterol levels, n = 7), and cost (eg, program costs, cost-effectiveness, n = 3) were reported. In some studies (n = 5), improved outcomes were found among participants who received direct referrals or additional assistance with indirect referrals compared with those who received indirect referrals only. CONCLUSION: Effective collaborations between health care organizations and community-based organizations are essential to facilitate necessary patient connection to resources for addressing their unmet needs. Although evidence indicated a positive influence of screening and referral programs on outcomes related to experience of care and population health, no definitive conclusions can be made on overall impact because of the potentially high risk of bias in the included studies.","Ruiz Escobar, Emily; Pathak, Shweta; Blanchard, Carrie M.",Prev Chronic Dis,https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd18.200569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34387188/,414

After the acute phase of the health crisis, when activity was drastically reduced, cycles have resumed, guided by the recommendations of scientific societies. In this article, a review is presented of all the published information regarding the virus and the reproductive system, pointing out the presence of ACE2 in the female and male reproductive system, at the testicular, ovarian, endometrial and embryonic levels. In addition, a comparative analysis is carried out between the recommendations of the scientific societies regarding the screening of infection, performance standards, and general laboratory measurements.","Borrás, A; Guimerà, M; Barral, Y; Agustí, I; Manau, D",Clin Invest Ginecol Obstet,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0210573X20300526?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0210573X20300526; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gine.2020.06.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834306/,414
647395,Recent trends in analytical and digital techniques for the detection of the SARS-Cov-2,2020-12-28,"BACKGROUND: Infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 leads to COVID‐19, the course of which is highly variable and depends on numerous patient‐specific risk factors. Patients with tumor diseases are considered to be more susceptible to severe COVID‐19; however, they also represent a heterogeneous group of individuals with variable risk. Identifying specific risk factors for a severe course of COVID‐19 in patients with cancer is of great importance. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with solid tumors or hematological malignancies and PCR‐confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection were included into the multicentric ADHOK (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Hämatologen und Onkologen im Krankenhaus e.V.) coronavirus tumor registry. Detailed information about the patients’ cancer disease, treatment, and laboratory parameters prior to infection, was collected retrospectively. The outcome of the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was graded according to the WHO. RESULTS: A total of 195 patients (68% with solid neoplasms and 32% with hematological malignancies) were included in the registry. Overall, the course of the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection varied greatly, as 69% of all patients were either asymptomatic or encountered a mild to moderate course, while 23% of the cohort died from COVID‐19. In multivariable analysis, preinfection laboratory parameters (determined at least 10 days and a median of 21 days before the first documentation of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection) significantly correlated with severe course of the disease. Out of these, the absolute neutrophil count prior to infection showed the strongest association with COVID‐19‐related death. CONCLUSION: The course of COVID‐19 in patients with tumor diseases is highly variable. Preinfection laboratory parameters may aid to identify patients at risk for severe COVID‐19 at an early stage prior to infection with the virus.

Accordingly, we performed a spatio-temporal study in this city to investigate the epidemiological aspects of the disease in an urban area and now wish to release a comprehensive dataset resulting from this study. DATA DESCRIPTION: These data include two data files and a help file. Data file 1: “COVID-19_Patients_Data” contains the patient sex and age + time from symptoms onset to hospital admission; hospitalization time; co-morbidities; manifest symptoms; exposure up to 14 days before admission; disease severity; diagnosis (with or without RT-PCR assay); and outcome (recovery vs. death). The data covers 4000 COVID-19 patients diagnosed between 14 Feb 2020 and 11 May 2020 in Khorasan-Razavi Province. Data file 2: “COVID-19_Spatiotemporal_Data” is a digital map of census tract divisions of Mashhad, the capital of the province, and their population by gender along with the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths including the calculated rates per 100,000 persons. This dataset can be a valuable resource for epidemiologists and health policymakers to identify potential risk factors, control and prevent pandemics, and optimally allocate health resources.","MohammadEbrahimi, Shahab; Mohammadi, Alireza; Bergquist, Robert; Akbarian, Mahsan; Arian, Mahnaz; Pishgar, Elahe; Kiani, Behzad",BMC Res Notes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34315517/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-021-05710-9,414

Because of the time constraints associated with the development of vaccines and effective drugs, drug repurposing and other alternative treatment methods have been used to treat patients that have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and have acquired COVID-19. Objective: The objective of this systematic scoping review is to provide an overview of the molecular mechanism of action of repurposed drugs or alternative treatment medicines used to attenuate COVID-19 disease. Method: The research articles or gray literature, including theses, government reports, and official news online, were identified from four databases and one search engine. The full content of a total of 160 articles that fulfilled our inclusion criteria was analyzed and information about six drugs (ritonavir, lopinavir, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, and chloroquine) and four Traditional Chinese Medicines (Shuang Huang Lian Kou Fu Ye, TCM combination of Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San and Da Yuan Yin, Xue Bi Jing Injection, and Qing Fei Pai Du Tang) was extracted. Results: All of the repurposed drugs and complementary medicine that have been used for the treatment of COVID-19 depend on the ability of the drug to inhibit the proliferation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by binding to enzyme active sites, viral chain termination, or triggering of the molecular pathway, whereas Traditional Chinese Medicine plays a pivotal role in triggering the inflammation pathway, such as the neuraminidase blocker, to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Lem, Fui Fui; Opook, Fernandes; Lee, Dexter Jiunn Herng; Chee, Fong Tyng; Lawson, Fahcina P.; Chin, Su Na",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33746739/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.585331,414

Recently, several publications on COVID-19 outcomes in this patient population appeared, but knowledge on optimal treatment, mortality, outcomes, and appropriate risk predictors is limited. A retrospective analysis was performed in a German high-volume lung transplant center between 19(th) March 2020 and 18(th) May 2021. Impact of COVID-19 on physical and psychological health, clinical outcomes, and mortality were analyzed including follow-up visits up to 12 weeks after infection in survivors. Predictive parameters on survival were assessed using univariate and multivariate proportional hazards regression models. Out of 1,046 patients in follow-up, 31 acquired COVID-19 during the pandemic. 12 of 31 (39%) died and 26 (84%) were hospitalized. In survivors a significant decline in exercise capacity (p = 0.034), TLC (p = 0.02), and DLCO (p = 0.007) was observed at follow-up after 3 months. Anxiety, depression, and self-assessed quality of life remained stable. Charlson comorbidity index predicted mortality (HR 1.5, 1.1–2.2; p = 0.023). In recipients with pre-existing CLAD, mortality and clinical outcomes were inferior. However, pre-existing CLAD did not predict mortality.

METHODS: Patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to our hospital from January 26, 2020, to March 16, 2020, were enrolled in this study. The basic data, the scores of the NRS2002 score sheet, and the serum prealbumin (PAB) level when these patients were admitted were collected, and the reflection of NRS2002 scores under different disease severity score settings to abnormal patients was analyzed. RESULTS: 1. When the severity of the disease was set to 0 points, four of the six hospitalized patients with PAB levels below the lower normal limit were not screened out; 2. When the severity was set to 1 point, two patients with COVID-19 who developed to a severe stage during the treatment process were screened out, but three of the six hospitalized patients with PAB levels below the lower normal limit at admission were not screened out; 3. When the severity of the disease of a patient with severe COVID-19 and fever scored 2 points, and that of a patient without fever scored 1 point, two patients with COVID-19 who developed to the severe stage during the treatment process were screened out, and six patients who were hospitalized with PAB levels below the lower normal limit at admission were also screened out. CONCLUSION: When the severe degree of patients with COVID-19 and fever is rated as 2 points, and that of the patients without fever is rated as 1 point, it can more accurately reflect the severity degree of patients with undernourishment.","Sun, Yanbo; He, Jing; Li, Weiming; Li, Shumin; Lin, Yueying; Cen, Yunyun; Li, Yanli",Int J Gen Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33833556/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s289655,414

Many of these food services are the last line of support for households facing food insecurity; as such, their relevance cannot be ignored in the midst of the economic upheaval caused by the pandemic. Our analysis is based on the application of balanced floating catchment areas and concentrates on households with lower incomes (<CAD40,000, approximately the Low Income Cutoff Value for a city of Hamilton's size). We find that accessibility was low to begin with in suburban and exurban parts of the city; furthermore, about 14% of locations originally available in Hamilton closed during the pandemic, further reducing accessibility. The impact of closures on the level of service of the remaining facilities, and on accessibility, was disproportionate, with system-wide losses exceeding 39%. Those losses were geographically and demographically uneven. While every part of the city faced a reduction in accessibility, inner suburbs fared worse in terms of loss of accessibility.

However, there are many different infectious and non-infectious diseases that have radiology like COVID-19. We are presenting a case of a patient having symptoms and a CT scan radiology comparable to that of COVID-19 and also having eosinophilia. The patient was initially diagnosed and treated as a COVID-19 patient. The patient stated that she had always complained of having dyspnea and cough, but it had increased even more in the past few days. Her thorax CT revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities with upper lobe predominance, which was reported as highly compatible with COVID-19 by radiologists. COVID-19 PCR result was negative twice. In laboratory results, eosinophil count was 2,850/mm(3) and total Ig was 768 IU/mL. However, when the laboratory values and the radiological findings were combined with the patient’s history, COVID-19 was excluded and the chronic eosinophilic pneumonia was accepted as a diagnosis. Clinicians more focused on COVID-19 while questioning the patients and while evaluating the laboratory and the radiological findings make it easier to miss other infectious and non-infectious diseases. Assessing the complete blood count result, focusing on the lymphocyte value, also makes it easy to skip eosinophilia.","Baran Ketencioğlu, Burcu; Yiğit, Fatma; Almadqa, Mohammed; Tutar, Nuri; Yılmaz, İnsu",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32983689/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.9989,414

OXA-48-like enzymes and their variants are unique carbapenemases with low or null hydrolytic activity toward carbapenems but no intrinsic activity against expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. CPEs have been classified by the WHO as high-priority pathogens given their association with morbidity and mortality and the scarce number of effective antibiotic treatments. In Spain, the frequency of OXA-48 CPE outbreaks is higher than in other European countries, representing the major resistance mechanism of CPEs. Horizontal transfer of plasmids and poor effective antibiotic treatment are additional threats to the correct prevention and control of these hospital outbreaks. One of the most important risk factors is antibiotic pressure, specifically carbapenem overuse.

However, the clinical efficacy of remdesivir for COVID-19 remains contentious, as several trials have not found statistically significant differences in either time to clinical improvement or mortality between remdesivir-treated and control groups. Similarly, the inability of remdesivir to provide a clinically significant benefit above other investigational agents in patients with Ebola contrasts with strong, curative preclinical data generated in rhesus macaque models. For both COVID-19 and Ebola, significant discordance between the robust preclinical data and remdesivir’s lackluster clinical performance have left many puzzled. Here, we critically evaluate the assumptions of the models underlying remdesivir’s promising preclinical data and show that such assumptions overpredict efficacy and minimize toxicity of remdesivir in humans. Had the limitations of in vitro drug efficacy testing and species differences in drug metabolism been considered, the underwhelming clinical performance of remdesivir for both COVID-19 and Ebola would have been fully anticipated.","Yan, Victoria C.; Muller, Florian L.",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.01117-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34252308/,414

In this work, the three-dimensional arrangements of amino acid side chains in known drug binding sites (substructures) were used to search for similarly arranged sites in SARS-CoV-2 protein structures in the Protein Data Bank for the potential repositioning of approved compounds. We were able to identify 22 target sites for the repositioning of 16 approved drug compounds as potential therapeutics for COVID-19. Using the same approach, we were also able to investigate the potentially promiscuous binding of the 16 compounds to off-target sites that could be implicated in toxicity and side effects that had not been provided by any previous studies. The investigations of binding properties in disease-related proteins derived from the comparison of amino acid substructure arrangements allows for effective mechanism driven decision making to rank and select only the compounds with the highest potential for success and safety to be prioritized for clinical trials or treatments. The intention of this work is not to explicitly identify candidate compounds but to present how an integrated drug repositioning and potential toxicity pipeline using side chain similarity searching algorithms are of great utility in epidemic scenarios involving novel pathogens. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we demonstrate that the pipeline can identify candidate compounds quickly and sustainably in combination with associated risk factors derived from the analysis of potential off-target site binding by the compounds to be repurposed.","Syatila Ab Ghani, Nur; Emrizal, Reeki; Makmur, Haslina; Firdaus-Raih, Mohd",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.10.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33101604/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037020304359?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2001037020304359,414

The effects of ACE inhibitor/angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers (ACEi/ARBs) on ACE2-angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7))-Mas receptor (MasR) axis activation has encouraged the use of such blockers in patients with kidney and cardiovascular diseases, until the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The previously unchallenged functions of the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-MasR axis and ACEi/ARBs are being re-evaluated in the era of COVID-19; the hypothesis is that ACEi/ARBs may increase the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection by upregulating the human ACE2 receptor expression level. In this review, we examine ACE2 molecular structure, function (as an enzyme of the RAS), and distribution. We explore the roles played by ACE2 in kidney, cardiovascular, and pulmonary diseases, highlighting studies that defined the benefits imparted when ACEi/ARBs activated the local ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-MasR axis.

Furthermore, impaired metabolism of glycoprotein components plays the main role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of glycoprotein levels in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. METHODS: All relevant papers in the English language were compiled by searching electronic databases, including Scopus, PubMed and Cochrane library. The keywords of glycoprotein, diabetes mellitus, glycan, glycosylation, and inhibitor were searched until January 2019. RESULTS: Glycoproteins are pivotal elements in the regulation of cell proliferation, growth, maturation and signaling pathways. Moreover, they are involved in drug binding, drug transportation, efflux of chemicals and stability of therapeutic proteins. These functions, structure, composition, linkages, biosynthesis, significance and biological effects are discussed as related to their use as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and its complications. CONCLUSIONS: The findings revealed several chemical and natural compounds have significant beneficial effects on glycoprotein metabolism. The comprehension of glycoprotein structure and functions are very essential and inevitable to enhance the knowledge of glycoengineering for glycoprotein-based therapeutics as may be required for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and its associated complications.

No vaccine to boost mucosal immunity, or as a therapeutic, has yet been developed to SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we discover and characterize a cross-reactive human IgA monoclonal antibody, MAb362. MAb362 binds to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and competitively blocks ACE2 receptor binding, by overlapping the ACE2 structural binding epitope. Furthermore, MAb362 IgA neutralizes both pseudotyped SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in 293 cells expressing ACE2. When converted to secretory IgA, MAb326 also neutralizes authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus while the IgG isotype shows no neutralization. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA antibodies, such as MAb362, may provide effective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 by inducing mucosal immunity within the respiratory system, a potentially critical feature of an effective vaccine.","Ejemel, Monir; Li, Qi; Hou, Shurong; Schiller, Zachary A.; Tree, Julia A.; Wallace, Aaron; Amcheslavsky, Alla; Kurt Yilmaz, Nese; Buttigieg, Karen R.; Elmore, Michael J.; Godwin, Kerry; Coombes, Naomi; Toomey, Jacqueline R.; Schneider, Ryan; Ramchetty, Anudeep S.; Close, Brianna J.; Chen, Da-Yuan; Conway, Hasahn L.; Saeed, Mohsan; Ganesa, Chandrashekar; Carroll, Miles W.; Cavacini, Lisa A.; Klempner, Mark S.; Schiffer, Celia A.; Wang, Yang",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-18058-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32826914/,414
652694,A comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 genomic analysis identifies potential targets for drug repurposing,2021-03-18,"BACKGROUND: Latest studies indicated that the general mental health level is low during the pandemic. Probably, this deterioration of the mental health situation is partly due to declines in physical activity. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in and the association between affective wellbeing and levels of different domains of physical activity at three time points before and during the pandemic. METHOD: We used a nationwide online panel with a trend data design encompassing a total sample of N = 3517, representing the German population (> 14 years). Four different activity domains (sport and exercise, light outdoor activity, housework/gardening, active travel) and affective wellbeing (positive and negative affect) were assessed at three time points before and during the Covid-19 pandemic (October 2019, March 2020, October 2020). RESULTS: Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) indicate differences regarding affective wellbeing over the three time points with the lowest values at the second time point. Levels of activity in the four domains differed significantly over time with the strongest decrease for sport and exercise from the first to the second time point. Partial correlations indicated that the relationships between sport and exercise and positive affect were most consistent over time. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that physical activity plays a particularly important role in the pandemic period as a protective factor against poor mental health. Especially sports and exercise seem to be supportive and should be encouraged, e.g. by providing additional support in finding adequate outdoor, home-based or digital substitutes.","Engels, Eliane S.; Mutz, Michael; Demetriou, Yolanda; Reimers, Anne K.",Arch Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34225801/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13690-021-00651-y,414

RECENT FINDINGS: While some existing literature has identified the presence of racial/ethnic inequities in HAI incidence and outcomes, few studies to date have evaluated whether HAI prevention efforts have mitigated these inequities. Factors contributing to inequities in HAI prevention may include unconscious bias of healthcare professionals towards minoritized patients; socioeconomic and structural inequities disparately affecting minoritized communities; the racial segregation of quality healthcare through hospital price discrimination; divergent reimbursement rates between public and private insurers; policies or performance metrics which underfund and financially penalize safety-net hospitals; and insufficient research evaluating and addressing HAI inequities. SUMMARY: Expansion of the literature is needed to further interrogate root causes and evaluate the impact of interventions on racial/ethnic inequities in HAI incidence. Measures to mitigate inequities might include teaching healthcare workers how to recognize and mitigate unconscious biases, expanding community resources which address the social and structural determinants of health, increasing access to preventive health services, reforming federal and institutional policies to better support safety-net hospitals and disincentivize price discrimination, and improving diversity and inclusion within the health workforce.","Chen, Jiabi; Khazanchi, Rohan; Bearman, Gonzalo; Marcelin, Jasmine R.",Curr Infect Dis Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34466126/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11908-021-00758-x,414

Design: An online cross-sectional study. Setting: Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Participants: A total of 2006 participants [953(47.5%) females, and 1053(52.5%) males], and more than 18 years of age were included in the study. Data collection and analysis: This cross-sectional survey was conducted at the Faculty of Medicine, Rabigh, King Abdulaziz University (KAU). The participants were approached by social media (SM). An online questionnaire was administered, and the data were analyzed on SPSS-26. Results: The SM was the leading source of information 889(43.9%). Two-thirds of the participants, 1250(66.9%) had various misconceptions, and about one-third of the study participants 637(31.7%) had disturbed social, mental, and psychological wellbeing, and many participants became more religious. Two-thirds of the study participants, 1292(68.1%) had good knowledge score. The attitude was highly positive in 1867(93.1%) participants, and the practice score was adequate in 1939(97.7%). The participants educational status was the predictor of good knowledge. Male gender and divorced ones were the predictor of poor practice scores and age 51-60 years, private jobholders, and students were the predictors of the good practice scores. The Saudi nationality was the predictor of participants positive attitude, while the male gender and divorced ones were predictors of a negative attitude. The male gender and higher education status were the predictors of good concepts, while the older age and job (own business) were the predictors of misconceptions. Conclusion: Our study observed several predictors of misconceptions, knowledge, attitudes, and practices among the Saudi population.

Like other respiratory diseases, including the 2003 SARS epidemic, the virus remains only about two months in any given population, yet the peak incidence and the lethality can vary. The data suggest that at least two strains of the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 virus have evolved during its migration from Mainland China to Europe. South Korea, Iran, and Italy were hit by the more dangerous ""SKII"" variant. While the epidemic in China is about to end, and in Europe about to level off, the course of the epidemic in the younger US population is still increasing and the peak level will likely depend on which of the strains has entered the US first. The same models that help us to understand the epidemic also help us to choose prevention strategies. While containment merely prolongs the time the disease circulates until the proportion of immune people is high enough for ""herd immunity"", reducing disease severity, either by vaccination or by early treatment of complications, is the best strategy against a respiratory virus disease.","Wittkowski, Knut M.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.20036715,414

In the past decades, disease outbreaks due to such zoonotic pathogens have appeared with an accelerated rate, which calls for an urgent development of adaptive (smart) therapeutics. Here, a computational strategy is developed to adaptively evolve peptides that could selectively inhibit mutating S protein receptor binding domains (RBDs) of different SARS‐CoV‐2 viral strains from binding to their human host receptor, angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Starting from suitable peptide templates, based on selected ACE2 segments (natural RBD binder), the templates are gradually modified by random mutations, while retaining those mutations that maximize their RBD‐binding free energies. In this adaptive evolution, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the template‐RBD complexes are iteratively perturbed by the peptide mutations, which are retained under favorable Monte Carlo decisions. The computational search will provide libraries of optimized therapeutics capable of reducing the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection on a global scale.","Chaturvedi, Parth; Han, Yanxiao; Král, Petr; Vuković, Lela",Adv Theory Simul,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173846/; https://doi.org/10.1002/adts.202000156,414

Taking into account interindividual differences in resilience competencies, we use a typological approach to identify different types of (trainee) teachers classified by their degrees and configurations of resilience competencies. Our empirical analysis is based on questionnaire data from 131 German vocational trainees and qualified teachers. The results reveal, among other things, that all three resilience competencies—resistance, flexibility, and dynamism—are significantly negatively correlated with the demands of working conditions and workload. Via a latent class analysis, we were able to identify three groups of (trainee) teachers who differed in their resilience competencies to adapt appropriately to different situations and their requirements (“behavioral flexibility”), to recover rapidly from setbacks and to defy the expectations of others (“behavioral resistance”), and to initiate changes as soon as they are necessary or desirable (“behavioral dynamics”). More resilient (trainee) teachers show, among other things, lower values for anxiety as an emotional stress symptom and higher values for job engagement. The findings are discussed with regard to implications for VET teacher training and we stress the need for equilibration on a systemic perspective.","Kärner, Tobias; Bottling, Matthias; Friederichs, Edgar; Sembill, Detlef",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.619912; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34295278/,414
655916,Epidemiology and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in Africa,2021-05-19,"BACKGROUND: Dental caries is one of the most prevalent non-communicable disease globally and can have serious health sequelae impacting negatively on quality of life. In the UK most adults experience dental caries during their lifetime and the 2009 Adult Dental Health Survey reported that 85% of adults have at least one dental restoration. Conservative removal of tooth tissue for both primary and secondary caries reduces the risk of failure due to tooth-restoration, complex fracture as well as remaining tooth surfaces being less vulnerable to further caries. However, despite its prevalence there is no consensus on how much caries to remove prior to placing a restoration to achieve optimal outcomes. Evidence for selective compared to complete or near-complete caries removal suggests there may be benefits for selective removal in sustaining tooth vitality, therefore avoiding abscess formation and pain, so eliminating the need for more complex and costly treatment or eventual tooth loss. However, the evidence is of low scientific quality and mainly gleaned from studies in primary teeth. METHOD: This is a pragmatic, multi-centre, two-arm patient randomised controlled clinical trial including an internal pilot set in primary dental care in Scotland and England. Dental health professionals will recruit 623 participants over 12-years of age with deep carious lesions in their permanent posterior teeth. Participants will have a single tooth randomised to either the selective caries removal or complete caries removal treatment arm. Baseline measures and outcome data (during the 3-year follow-up period) will be assessed through clinical examination, patient questionnaires and NHS databases. A mixed-method process evaluation will complement the clinical and economic outcome evaluation and examine implementation, mechanisms of impact and context. The primary outcome at three years is sustained tooth vitality. The primary economic outcome is net benefit modelled over a lifetime horizon. Clinical secondary outcomes include pulp exposure, progession of caries, restoration failure; as well as patient-centred and economic outcomes. DISCUSSION: SCRiPT will provide evidence for the most clinically effective and cost-beneficial approach to managing deep carious lesions in permanent posterior teeth in primary care. This will support general dental practitioners, patients and policy makers in decision making. Trial Registration Trial registry: ISRCTN. Trial registration number: ISRCTN76503940.

This patient exhibited a rapid evolution towards multiorgan failure. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in multiple nasopharyngeal, blood, and pleural samples, despite antiviral and immunomodulator treatment. Clinical evolution in the blood was marked by an increase (2–3-fold) in differentiated effector T cells expressing exhaustion (PD-1) and senescence (CD57) markers, an expansion of antibody-secreting cells, a 15-fold increase in γδ T cell and proliferating NK-cell populations, and the total disappearance of monocytes, suggesting lung trafficking. In the serum, waves of a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm, Th1 and Th2 activation, and markers of T cell exhaustion, apoptosis, cell cytotoxicity, and endothelial activation were observed until the fatal outcome.

Methods We prospectively collected demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of children <5 years with radiologically confirmed CAAP referred to the Soroka University Medical Center during 2001–2011. Three groups of children were compared: 1) those hospitalized in the PICU (PICU-CAAP); 2) those treated in the emergency department and discharged (ED-CAAP); and 3) those hospitalized in a pediatric ward (Hosp-CAAP). Results Of 9,722 CAAP episodes, 367 (3.8%) were PICU-CAAP, 5,552 (57.1%) Hosp-CAAP and 3,803 (39.1%) ED-CAAP. In a univariate analysis, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected more commonly among PICU-CAAP than in Hosp-CAAP (P=0.02) and ED-CAAP patients (P<0.001). In a multivariate analysis, several factors were associated with PICU hospitalization versus ED-CAAP and Hosp-CAAP: Younger age (ORs: 1.04, [95%CI: 1.02-1.05] and 0.97 [0.96–0.98], respectively); prematurity (ORs: 2.16 [1.28–3.64] and 1.61 [1.15–2.26], respectively), lower O2 saturation (ORs: 1.32 [1.25-1.41] and 0.94[0.92-0.96]), higher respiratory rate (ORs: 1.06 [1.04-1.07] and 1.00 [1-1.01], respectively). Conclusion Children admitted to PICU were younger, had more respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detection, were premature, had lower O2 saturation, and had a higher respiratory rate than those admitted to the general ward or those visiting the emergency department and subsequently discharged.","Feinstein, Yael; Greenberg, David; Ben-Shimol, Shalom; Mimran, Maya; Dagan, Ron; Givon-Lavi, Noga",Pediatr Neonatol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875957220300504?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedneo.2020.03.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32386941/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1875957220300504,414

We have developed an automated Cluster Picker which identifies monophyletic clades meeting user-input criteria for bootstrap support and maximum genetic distance within large phylogenetic trees. A second tool, the Cluster Matcher, automates the process of linking genetic data to epidemiological or clinical data, and matches clusters between runs of the Cluster Picker. RESULTS: We explore the effect of different bootstrap and genetic distance thresholds on clusters identified in a data set of publicly available HIV sequences, and compare these results to those of a previously published tool for cluster identification. To demonstrate their utility, we then use the Cluster Picker and Cluster Matcher together to investigate how clusters in the data set changed over time. We find that clusters containing sequences from more than one UK location at the first time point (multiple origin) were significantly more likely to grow than those representing only a single location. CONCLUSIONS: The Cluster Picker and Cluster Matcher can rapidly process phylogenetic trees containing tens of thousands of sequences. Together these tools will facilitate comparisons of pathogen transmission dynamics between studies and countries.","Ragonnet-Cronin, Manon; Hodcroft, Emma; Hué, Stéphane; Fearnhill, Esther; Delpech, Valerie; Brown, Andrew J Leigh; Lycett, Samantha",BMC Bioinformatics,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-14-317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24191891/,414

Previous studies show that it is possible to perform some therapy using a robot. This article is a synthesis review of the literature on research with the use of robots in the therapy of children with the diagnosis of early childhood autism. The review includes scientific journals from 2005–2021. Using descriptors: ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorders), Social robots, and Robot-based interventions, an analysis of available research in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science was done. The results showed that a robot seems to be a great tool that encourages contact and involvement in joint activities. The review of the literature indicates the potential value of the use of robots in the therapy of people with autism as a facilitator in social contacts. Robot-Assisted Autism Therapy (RAAT) can encourage child to talk or do exercises. In the second aspect (prompting during a conversation), a robot encourages eye contact and suggests possible answers, e.g., during free conversation with a peer. In the third aspect (teaching, entertainment), the robot could play with autistic children in games supporting the development of joint attention. These types of games stimulate the development of motor skills and orientation in the body schema. In future work, a validation test would be desirable to check whether children with ASD are able to do the same with a real person by learning distrust and cheating the robot.","Szymona, Barbara; Maciejewski, Marcin; Karpiński, Robert; Jonak, Kamil; Radzikowska-Büchner, Elżbieta; Niderla, Konrad; Prokopiak, Anna",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21113720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34071829/,414

METHODS: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Zhejiang Province, China, from January 17 to February 12, 2020, were enrolled. Liver enzyme level elevation was defined as alanine aminotransferase level >35 U/L for men and 25 U/L for women at admission. Patients with normal alanine aminotransferase levels were included in the control group. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and patients symptomatic with SARS-CoV-2 infection were defined as patients with COVID-19. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected and compared. RESULTS: Of 788 patients with COVID-19, 222 (28.2%) patients had elevated liver enzyme levels (median [interquartile range {IQR}] age, 47.0 [35.0–55.0] years; 40.5% women). Being male, overweight, and smoking increased the risk of liver enzyme level elevation. The liver enzyme level elevation group had lesser pharyngalgia and more diarrhea than the control group. The median time from illness onset to admission was 3 days for liver enzyme level elevation groups (IQR, 2–6), whereas the median hospitalization time for 86 (38.7%) discharged patients was 13 days (IQR, 11–16). No differences in disease severity and clinical outcomes were noted between the groups. DISCUSSION: We found that 28.2% of patients with COVID-19 presented with elevated liver enzyme levels on admission, which could partially be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In the current epidemiological context, CRD have received much interest when considering their correlation with greater susceptibility to SARS-Cov-2 and severe disease (COVID-19). Increasingly more studies have investigated pathophysiological interactions between CRD and COVID-19. AREA COVERED: Animal experimentation has decisively contributed to advancing our knowledge of CRD. Considering the increase in ethical restrictions in animal experimentation, researchers must focus on new experimental alternatives. Two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures have complemented animal models and significantly contributed to advancing research in the life sciences. However, 2D cell cultures have several limitations in studies of cellular interactions. Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures represent a new and robust platform for studying complex biological processes and are a promising alternative in regenerative and translational medicine. EXPERT OPINION: Three-dimensional cell cultures are obtained by combining several types of cells in integrated and self-organized systems in a 3D structure. These 3D cell culture systems represent an efficient methodological approach in studies of pathophysiology and lung therapy. More recently, complex 3D culture systems, such as lung-on-a-chip, seek to mimic the physiology of a lung in vivo through a microsystem that simulates alveolar-capillary interactions and exposure to air. The present review introduces and discusses 3D lung cultures as robust platforms for studies of the pathophysiology of CRD and COVID-19 and the mechanisms that underlie interactions between CRD and COVID-19.","da Silva da Costa, Felipe Allan; Soares, Murilo Racy; Malagutti-Ferreira, Maria José; da Silva, Gustavo Ratti; Lívero, Francislaine Aparecida dos Reis; Ribeiro-Paes, João Tadeu",Tissue Eng Regen Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13770-021-00348-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34080133/,414

Nonetheless, veterans often struggle with their transition into civilian life and workplaces. This problem often limits the extent to which work organizations utilize their talents. Here, we briefly review relevant work from outside the management field and nascent work within the field to build a conceptual model for understanding the integration of veterans into the workplace. We do this by applying diversity and person-environment fit perspectives. A diversity standpoint helps us to understand veterans as a social group and their inclusion in the workplace, while the person-environment fit perspective helps us describe veterans’ compatibility with their work environments in terms of organizational demands and veterans’ needs. We intend for this conceptual model to guide future empirical research on veterans as human capital and their transition into civilian organizations as part of their societal reintegration, career development, and personal well-being.","Gonzalez, Jorge A.; Simpson, Joseph",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053482220300486; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053482220300486,414

COVID-19 has been officially declared as a universal pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The epidemiological characteristics of COVID-2019 have not been completely understood yet. More than 200000 persons were killed during this epidemic (till 1 May 2020). Therefore, developing forecasting models to predict the spread of that epidemic is a critical issue. In this study, statistical and artificial intelligence based approaches have been proposed to model and forecast the prevalence of this epidemic in Egypt. These approaches are autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural networks (NARANN). The official data reported by The Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population of COVID-19 cases in the period between 1 March and 1 May, 2020 was used to train the models. The forecasted cases showed a good agreement with officially reported cases. The obtained results of this study may help the Egyptian decision-makers to put short-term future plans to face this epidemic.","Saba, Amal I.; Elsheikh, Ammar H.",Process Saf Environ Prot,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32501368/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psep.2020.05.029; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957582020310259?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0957582020310259,414

Many microorganisms cause pneumonia, and now concern is turning to the importance of the cause the new therapies for viral pneumonia. In the current study, we report the effect of andrographolide sulfonate, a water-soluble form of andrographolide (trade name: Xi-Yan-Ping Injection), on poly I: C-induced pneumonia. Andrographolide sulfonate was administrated through intraperitoneal injection to mice with poly I: C-induced pneumonia. Recruitment of airway inflammatory cells, alteration of lung histological induced by Poly I: C were significantly ameliorated by andrographolide sulfonate. The protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) and serum were reduced by andrographolide sulfonate treatment. The levels of MUC5AC and MUC5B in lung tissue were also suppressed. These results reveal that andrographolide sulfate remarkably alleviated pneumonia induced by poly I:C in mice. Moreover, andrographolide sulfonate markedly inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Taken together, we demonstrated that andrographolide sulfonate ameliorated poly I: C-induced pneumonia in mice, suggesting the possible use of andrographolide sulfonate for virus-induced pneumonia in clinical.","Cui, Jian; Gao, Jian; Li, Yan; Fan, Ting; Qu, Jiao; Sun, Yang; Liu, Wen; Guo, Wenjie; Xu, Qiang",J Pharmacol Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S134786132030089X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jphs.2020.08.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S134786132030089X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33070837/,414

Nowadays, speckle tracking allows an objective quantification of regional wall function. We aimed to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of global (GLS) and regional longitudinal strain (RLS) during DSE to detect significant coronary stenosis (SCS). We conducted a prospective observational multicenter study including patients undergoing DSE for suspected SCS. 50 patients with positive DSE underwent coronary angiography. Besides visual regional wall motion score index (WMSI), GLS and RLS were determined at rest and at peak stress by Automated Function Imaging. DSE GLS feasibility was 96%. Among 35 patients with SCS, 12 patients were affected by multivessel disease, 18 had stenosis of left anterior descending artery (LAD), 18 of left circumflex (LCX) and 15 of right coronary artery (RCA). At peak stress, both GLS reduction (p = 0.037) and WMSI worsening (p = 0.04) showed significant agreement with coronary angiography for detecting SCS. When single lesion was considered, peak stress GLS and LAD RLS were lower in the obstructed LAD regions than in normo-perfused territories (17.4 ± 5.5 vs. 20.5 ± 4.4%, p = 0.03; 17.1 ± 7.6 vs. 21.6 ± 5.5%, p < 0.02, respectively). Furthermore, the addition of RLS to regional WMSI was able to improve accuracy in LAD SCS prediction (AUC 0.68, p = 0.037). Conversely, in presence of LCX or RCA SCS, LS was less accurate than WMSI at peak stress. In conclusion, DSE strain analysis is feasible and may improve prediction of LAD SCS, whereas regional WMSI assessment performs better in presence of SCS of LCX and RCA.","Ilardi, Federica; Santoro, Ciro; Maréchal, Patrick; Dulgheru, Raluca; Postolache, Adriana; Esposito, Roberta; Giugliano, Giuseppe; Sannino, Anna; Avvedimento, Marisa; Leone, Attilio; Cirillo, Plinio; Stabile, Eugenio; Lancellotti, Patrizio; Esposito, Giovanni",Int J Cardiovasc Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33433744/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10554-020-02121-y,414

664330,Rapid selection of a human monoclonal antibody that potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 in two animal models,2020-06-02,"BACKGROUND: eConsulta—that is, asynchronous, two-way teleconsultation in primary care—is one of the most important telemedicine developments in the Catalan public health system, a service that has been heavily boosted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is vital to know the characteristics of its users in order to be able to meet their needs and understand the coverage of this service in a context where there is reduced accessibility to the health system. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the profile of the citizens who use the eConsulta tool and the reasons for their use, as well as to gain an understanding of the elements that characterize their decision to use it while distinguishing between those who used it before and those who have used it since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A descriptive, observational study based on administrative data was performed. This study differentiates between the COVID-19 pandemic era and the period preceding it, considering the day the state of emergency was declared in Spain (ie, March 12, 2020) as the cut-off point. It also differentiates between eConsulta users who send messages and those who only receive them. RESULTS: During the pandemic, the number of unique users of this teleconsultation service had almost tripled, with up to 33.10 visits per 1000 inhabitants per month reported in the first three months. For the two user profiles analyzed, most users since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak were predominantly female, systematically younger, more actively employed, and with less complex pathologies. Furthermore, eConsulta users received more messages proactively from the health professionals. There was also a relative decrease in the number of conversations initiated by higher-income urban users and an increase in conversations initiated by users in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has helped to generalize the use of telemedicine as a tool to compensate, to some extent, for the decline in face-to-face visits, especially among younger citizens in Catalonia. Telemedicine has made it possible to maintain contact between citizens and the health care system in the context of maximum complexity.","Solans, Oscar; Vidal-Alaball, Josep; Roig Cabo, Pasqual; Mora, Núria; Coma, Ermengol; Bonet Simó, Josep Maria; Hermosilla Pérez, Eduardo; Saigí-Rubió, Francesc; Olmos Domínguez, Carmen; Piera-Jiménez, Jordi; Abizanda González, Mercè; López Seguí, Francesc",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33970867/; https://doi.org/10.2196/28629,414

Effective biosurveillance systems can primarily support appropriate responses to biological threats and consequently save human lives. Nevertheless, biosurveillance systems are costly to implement and hard to operate. Furthermore, they rely on static infrastructures that might not cope with the evolving dynamics of the monitored environment. In this paper, we present a reorganizing biosurveillance framework for the detection and localization of biological threats with fog and mobile edge computing support. In the proposed framework, a hierarchy of fog nodes are responsible for aggregating monitoring data within their regions and detecting potential threats. Although fog nodes are deployed on a fixed base station infrastructure, the framework provides an innovative technique for reorganizing the monitored environment structure to adapt to the evolving environmental conditions and to overcome the limitations of the static base station infrastructure. Evaluation results illustrate the ability of the framework to localize biological threats and detect infected areas. Moreover, the results show the effectiveness of the reorganization mechanisms in adjusting the environment structure to cope with the highly dynamic environment.","Al-Zinati, Mohammad; Alrashdan, Reem; Al-Duwairi, Basheer; Aloqaily, Moayad",Multimed Tools Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837246/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-020-09050-x,414

The purpose of the present study was, therefore, to examine compliance to personal protective behavioral recommendations to contain the spread of COVID-19 among urban residents engaged in the informal economic activities in Wolaita Sodo town, Southern Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study design was used where quantitative data were collected through the survey research method. Three hundred and eighty-four participants of the urban-based informal economy were randomly selected and contacted in their own natural settings with an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data were inserted into SPSS software for analysis that involved both descriptive and inferential statistics, including frequency and percentage distributions, binomial and multinomial logistic regressions. The results of the research indicated that only 35.4% of the respondents regularly wore a mask. In addition, 54.9% of the survey participants disclosed that they do not clean their hands with disinfectants after touching objects under circumstances where they cannot get access to water and soap. Moreover, the most commonly reported reason of respondents for non-compliance to regular wearing of a mask has been its inconvenience or discomfort (62.8%), followed by the need to appear indifferent because most people around them do not wear a mask (25.2%). Furthermore, experiences of the respondents of regularly wearing a mask are significantly associated with regular attendance of the media regarding the preventive mechanisms of COVID-19 (OR = 0.224; P < 0.001; 95%C.I: 0.109–0.460), knowledge of someone ever infected by COVID-19 (OR = 0.402; P < 0.05; 95%C.I: 0.190–0.851), the belief that COVID-19 causes a severe illness (OR = 0.444; P < 0.05; 95%C.I: 0.201–0.980), and perception of the likelihood of dying as a result of infection by COVID-19 (OR = 0.374; P < 0.01; 95% C.I: 0.197–0.711). The authors have found a low level of compliance to the recommended safety measures, especially wearing of masks. It is, therefore, important that continued efforts of raising awareness should be done by all the concerned bodies. Above all, urban safety net programs that aim at keeping such social groups at home, at least during the critical wave of the pandemic, should also be strengthened.","Zewude, Bewunetu; Melese, Belayneh; Habtegiorgis, Tewodros; Tadele, Mihret; Solomon, Weynishet",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.716814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34422754/,414

This study shows the effect of the pandemic on our practice in paediatric orthopaedics in a referral third level paediatric hospital. METHODS: We performed a single-centre retrospective review of the official census from a third level paediatric hospital from 14 March to 14 April for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: The patients seen in our clinic during this period in 2020 decreased in by 82% (p < 0.001) compared with 2018 and 2019, however, the number of telemedicine consultations increased by 90.21% (p < 0.001). The total number of patients attending the clinic (including onsite and virtual) was reduced by 54.25% (p < 0.001). The total surgeries performed plummeted by 81% in this period in 2020 (p < 0.001) due to a reduction in elective cases of 94.6% (p < 0.001). No significant decrease was found in the number of urgent surgical cases per day in 2020 (p = 0.34). Finally, the number of orthopaedic patients admitted to our emergency department dropped by 78.6% during the state of alarm (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: According to our results, the pandemic has significantly affected our daily practice by decreasing elective surgeries and onsite clinics, but other activities have increased. As we have implemented telemedicine and new technologies to adapt to this setback, we should take advantage of the situation to change our practice in the future to better allocate our health resources and to anticipate outbreaks.

In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative public health strategies to control the spread. Here, we have conducted an online search for all relevant public health interventions for COVID-19. We then characterize and summarize the global COVID-19 pandemic situation and recommend potential mitigation strategies in the context of Ethiopia. Methods: Initial search of Pub Med central and Google scholar was undertaken followed by analysis of the text words; COVID-19,SARS-CoV-2, Global lessons and Pandemic; A second search using all identified keywords including COVID-19, Epidemiology, Sociocultural, Ethiopia; thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles were searched. Accordingly, of the 1,402 articles, 39 were included in the analysis for this review. Result: Countries COVID-19 mitigation strategies widely varied. The most common global COVID-19 mitigation strategies include; whole of government approach including individual, community and environmental measures, detecting and isolating cases, contact tracing and quarantine, social and physical distancing measures including for mass gatherings and international travel measures. Models revealed that, social and physical distancing alone could prevent the pandemic from 60-95%, if timely and effectively implemented. Moreover, detecting and isolation of cases were found to be crucial while access to testing was found to the global challenge. Individual measures including proper hand washing were also reported to be effective measures in preventing the pandemic. Asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 ranged from 25% to 80% and as a result, countries are revising the case definition for early detection of mild symptomatic cases of COVID-19 with inclusion of Chills, Muscle pain and new loss of taste or smell in addition to Cough, Shortness of breath, Fever and Sore throat. Global reports also revealed that the incubation period of COVID-19 could go to 24 days. Ethiopia is also unique in the aspects of sociocultural prospects while more than 99.3% of the population has a religion. Moreover, 69% of the population is under the age of 29 years old and the health policy in the country focused on prevention and primary health care. All these could be potential entries and opportunities to combat COVID-19 pandemic in the context of Ethiopia. Conclusion: While recommendations may change depending on the level of outbreak, we conclude that in Most countries have benefited from early interventions and in setups like Africa including Ethiopia where health system capability is limited, community engagement supported by local evidence with strict implementation of social and physical distancing measures is mandatory. Active involvement of religious Institutions and mobilizing youth could be entry to increase public awareness in mitigating COVID-19. Community level case detection could enhance early identification of cases which could be implemented through the health extension program. Isolation and quarantine beyond 14 days could help identify long term carriers of COVID-19. Validation and use of rapid test kits could be vital to increase access for testing. Revision of case definitions for COVID-19 could be important for early detection and identification of mild symptomatic cases.","Getaneh, Y.; Yizengaw, A.; Adane, S.; Zealiyas, K.; Abate, Z.; Leulseged, S.; Desalegn, H.; Yimer, G.; Abate, E.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.23.20111062; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.23.20111062v1?rss=1,414

Main funding source(s): Instituto Nacional de Cardiologia Ignacio Chavez INTRODUCTION: Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) is a progressive disease that significantly reduces patients"" quality of life and survival.1 In our country there are no statistics of this disease, only isolated cases. The ability to diagnose it has dramatically improved since the 2019 Multisociety Consensus for Multimodality Imaging.2,3 The study aimed to know patients"" demographic and imaging characteristics in suspected ATTR-CA and the prevalence of positive cases in a reference Cardiology Center using 99mTc-pyrophosphate scintigraphy (99mTc-PYP). METHODS: Prospective, observational study approved by Institutional committees. We studied with 99mTc-PYP patients from November 2019 to December 2020 sent to the Nuclear Cardiology Department with clinical suspicion of ATTR-CA and negative light chain quantification. We included parameters as red flags, ECHO suggestive findings (septal thickness >12 mm, diastolic dysfunction), and MRI suggestive findings. ATTR-CA was diagnosed by clinical suspicious, positive scintigraphy, and negative serum studies. 99mTc-PYP were acquired according to current recommendations. Frequency distribution of categorical variables were reported as frequencies and percentages; continuous variables are presented in mean. Mann-Whitney U tests were conducted for continuous variables, while Fisher""s exact test was performed for categorical variables. RESULTS: Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, our Cardiology Hospital reconverted to covid attention; we studied a reduced number, and they were mainly inpatients: total 35 (28-inpatients, 7-outpatients). 21 (60%) were male, 14 (40%) were female, average age was 56.5 yo. 31%-heart failure diagnosis, 6%-history of carpal tunnel syndrome and 3%-spinal stenosis. ECHO: 26% had suggestive imaging, 43% with diastolic dysfunction, and 37% had a septal thickness >12mm. MRI: 42.9% had suggestive CA findings. No significant differences were found in the characteristics of suspicion between positive and negative patients. Regarding of the 35 patients scintigraphy, 7 (20%) were positives, establishing ATTR-CA diagnosis, 28 (80%) were negatives. The positivity probability was significant by H/Cl ratio, Perugini score, and SPECT findings (p 0.001). Until this protocol started and we share it among hospital physicians, we had never been asked to acquired this type of scintigraphy. Our study shows that if we purposely search for the disease, it can be found. The sample is small due to the limitations we had in the face of the pandemic; however, the study findings are significant for ATTR-CA diagnosis. It is striking that the ECHO and MRI suggestive findings were not statistically significant for the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: We present the initial experience of the first study of cardiac amyloidosis in our country, to show the disease""s presence and that the diagnosis can be made effectively, quickly, economically, and non-invasively by nuclear medicine scintigraphy.","Carvajal, I; Berrios-Barcenas, E; C-Guerra, E; Barajas-Paulin, A; Luna-Alvarez Amezquita, A; Canseco-Leon, N; Alexanderson-Rosas, E",Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jeab111.059,414

A dedicated route plan was drawn with a dedicated elevator meant for COVID-19. A new temporary holding area was created. Dedicated trucks with requisite labels were deployed to transport COVID-19 waste to a common biomedical waste treatment facility. Communication challenges were addressed through timely circulars, which were further reinforced and reiterated during various on-going training programs. RESULTS: Before the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, the amount of biomedical waste generated was 1.93 kg/bed/day; currently, the quantity of COVID-19 biomedical waste generated is 7.76 kg/COVID bed/day. Daily COVID-19 waste generation data are maintained and uploaded in an android application monitored by Central Pollution Control Board, Government of India. To date, none of the workers handling COVID-19 waste has acquired health-care associated COVID-19 infection, which reflects on the soundness of the new system and the infection control practices in the institute. CONCLUSIONS: A responsive leadership harmonizing with a robust communication and training system has augmented timely re-engineering of structure and processes for better outcomes in the war on waste.","Gowda, Naveen R.; Siddharth, Vijaydeep; Inquillabi, Khalid; Sharma, D.

A substandard educational environment is associated with poor patient care and suboptimal learning outcomes. The measurement of the educational environment provides insight into what is needed to improve the level of training. OBJECTIVE: To measure the educational environment as perceived by trainees within the Malta Foundation Programme. METHODS: This study used the Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environment Measure (PHEEM) to measure the educational environment at the Malta Foundation Programme. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the demographics of the study population. Nonparametric comparative statistics were used to identify statistically significant differences between groups. RESULTS: Ninety-eight trainees out of 370 (26.5%) completed the online questionnaire. These consisted of 39 FY1s (31.5% of 124), 33 FY2s (24.8% of 133), and 26 extended FYs (23.0% of 113). The 40-item PHEEM showed good reliability with a Cronbach’s α value of .912. These doctors perceived their educational environment as more positive than negative. Perceptions are worst among trainees at the end of their first year of training. Those who had just finished their training have reported better perceptions. The 3 worst scoring items are related to when the trainees are on call. CONCLUSION: Among trainees within the Malta Foundation Programme, perceptions of role autonomy and social support are areas where most work is needed. Teaching seems to be moving in the right direction, but there is always room for improvement.","Grech, Marco; Grech, Stefania",J Med Educ Curric Dev,https://doi.org/10.1177/23821205211035640; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34368458/,414

METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted on 103 elderly patients with post-stroke aspiration pneumonia and moderate respiratory failure (oxygenation index: 100–200 mmHg) that had been admitted. The patients were divided into two groups according to the mode of oxygen therapy that was used: the Venturi mask group and the HFNC treatment group. The two groups were analyzed and compared in terms of the changes in the blood gas indices measured at different points in time (4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h), the proportion of patients that required transition to invasive auxiliary ventilation, and the 28-day mortality rate. RESULTS: A total of 103 patients were retrospectively analyzed; 16 cases were excluded, and 87 patients were included in the final patient group (42 in the HFNC group and 45 in the Venturi group). There was a statistically significant difference in the oxygenation indices of the HFNC group and the Venturi group (F = 546.811, P < 0.05). There was a statistically significant interaction between the monitored oxygenation indices and the mode of oxygen therapy (F = 70.961, P < 0.05), and there was a statistically significant difference in the oxygenation indices for the two modes of oxygen therapy (F = 256.977, P < 0.05). HFNC therapy contributed to the improvement of the oxygenation indices at a rate of 75.1%. The Venturi and HFNC groups also differed significantly in terms of the proportion of patients that required transition to invasive auxiliary ventilation within 72 h (P < 0.05). The HFNC group’s risk for invasive ventilation was 0.406 times that of the Venturi group (P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference in the 28-day mortality rate of the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: HFNC could significantly improve the oxygenation state of patients with post-stroke aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure, and it may reduce the incidence of invasive ventilation.","Xing, Dong; Chen, Yu-Hong; Wang, Lan -Tao; Yu, Bin; Ran, Zhi -Bin; Chen, Li",BMC Pulm Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-020-01359-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33413281/,414

It originates from the vascular endothelium. It is well known that the development of KS is associated with human herpes virus 8 (i.e. HHV8) infections. Sporadic KS cases have mainly been found in Africa. Isolated splenic KS in Asia has rarely been reported. We present here a case of KS primarily involving the spleen in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative Chinese patient. CASE SUMMARY: A 50-year-old male patient was admitted to hospital due to abdominal distension and discomfort, reduced food intake and weight loss. Medical examination revealed that the patient had moderate anemia, a low platelet count, slight fatty liver and a huge mass in the spleen. Spleen lymphoma was considered. An anti-HIV test was negative. The whole spleen was surgically excised. The final pathological diagnosis was nodular stage spleen KS, and the patient underwent total splenectomy. He recovered well and was discharged from hospital 12 d after surgery. Two weeks later, the patient developed liver metastasis and died within 1 mo after surgery. CONCLUSION: KS is difficult to diagnose and pathological examination is necessary. KS has a poor prognosis and should be diagnosed and treated early to improve survival.","Zhao, Chuan-Jie; Ma, Guang-Zhen; Wang, Yan-Jun; Wang, Jin-Hong",World J Clin Cases,https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v9.i18.4765; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34222445/,414
670083,A broadly neutralizing humanized ACE2-targeting antibody against SARS-CoV-2 variants,2021-08-17,"The importance of testing and surveillance of an infectious disease cannot be underestimated. The testing is the first step to detect an infectious disease, and mass testing can slow or mitigate the spread of an infectious disease. Despite overwhelming evidence and the importance of testing discussed in the literature, there have been claims that ""more COVID-19 testing creates more cases"". Therefore, there is a need to study whether massive testing is the reason for detecting more positive COVID-19 cases. In this research, we used a dataset from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services and empirically showed that by increasing the COVID-19 testing in the U.S., the spread of the COVID-19 decreased significantly. Our results indicate a negative relationship between the number of positive cases and the number of tests performed in the past months. The large-scale testing may have helped identify positive and asymptomatic cases early in the course of illness, which enabled individuals to isolate themselves, thus reducing the chances of spreading the diseases and slowing the spread of the pandemic.","Ahmed, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248740v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.23.20248740,414

A SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The majority of critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units with confirmed severe infection with SARS-CoV-2 developed an acute respiratory distress like syndrome. The main objective of this opinion paper is to raise the discussion about the possible benefit of keeping the patient with COVID-19 disease and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) in the prone position during the perioperative period, especially where this position is not a required factor for the surgical or invasive procedure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This multi-national cross-sectional survey was administered to clinicians working in major Asia-Pacific cities during the mandatory social lockdown period in June 2020. Clinical demographics and professional data, delivery of Andrology-related healthcare services, and patient distress based on validated questionnaires such as Depression and Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) and Decisional Engagement Scale (DES) were collected. RESULTS: Telehealth medicine was instituted in all the centres with the majority of centres (92.9%) reported a 50% or more reduction in out-patient related services. The numbers of phone calls, emails correspondence and educational webinars have significantly increased. Despite the provision of reasons for changes in healthcare service and delay in surgery, more than half of the patients (57.1%) rated 2 on the DASS score for the item on patients over-react to situations, while a third of the patients (35.7%) scored a 2 for DASS item on patients being more demanding or unreasonable. The DES scores were more positive with most patients reported a score above 7 out of 10 in terms of items on accepting current arrangement (85.7%), confident in clinician decision-making about treatment (92.9%) and comfortable that the decision is consistent with their preferences (71.4%).

In this study, we quantified the associations between residential mobility index (RMI), air pollution, meteorology, and daily cases and deaths of COVID-19 in Sao Paulo, Brazil Objectives To acquire time-series data to estimate the associations between daily residential mobility index (RMI), air pollution, and meteorology, and daily cases and deaths for COVID-19 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods We applied a semiparametric generalized additive model (GAM) to estimate: 1) the association between residential mobility index and cases and deaths due to COVID-19, accounting for ambient particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), relative humidity, temperature and delayed exposure between 3-21 days and 2) the association between exposure to for ambient particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), accounting for relative humidity, temperature and mobility. Results We found an RMI of 45.28% results in 1,212 cases (95% CI: 1,189 to 1,235) and 44 deaths (95% CI: 40 to 47). Reducing mobility 5% would avoid 438 cases and 21 deaths. Also, we found that an increment of 10 g m-3 of PM2.5 risk of 1.140 (95% CI: 1.021 to 1.274) for cases and of 1.086 (95% CI: 1.008 to 1.170 for deaths, while O3 produces a relative risk of 1.075 (95% CI: 1.006 to 1.150) for cases and 1.063 (95% CI: 1.006 to 1.124) for deaths, respectively. Discussion We compared our results with observations and literature review, finding well agreement. These results implicate that authorities and policymakers can use such mobility indices as tools to support social distance activities and assess their effectiveness in the coming weeks and months. Small increments of air pollution pose a risk of COVID-19 cases. Conclusion Spatial distancing is a determinant factor to control cases and deaths for COVID-19. Small increments of air pollution result in a high number of COVID-19 cases and deaths.

Forty-three men from the general population completed the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R), Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21). Twenty-eight percent reported CHS. No differences on the scores of the questionnaires emerged between men with and without CHS, except on CAMS-R Attention scores. In a logistic regression analysis lower CAMS-R Attention scores predicted CHS (β = −0.34, p = 0.03). This is the first, yet preliminary investigation on CHS during quarantine. The prevalence of CHS appears higher than the rates (4%) reported in the last years before the COVID-19 outbreak. Perhaps people showed more intense hoarding tendencies during quarantine/social distancing, and this pattern should be monitored. Larger samples, longitudinal designs and clinician-rated instruments are needed to support or not our findings.","Marazziti, Donatella; Pozza, Andrea; Mucci, Federico; Dettore, Davide",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.634454; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34194342/,414
674704,A direct RNA-protein interaction atlas of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells,2020-07-15,"In order to define public health policies, simple, inexpensive and robust detection methods for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are vital for mass-testing in resource limited settings. The current choice of molecular methods for identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection includes nucleic acid-based testing (NAT) for viral genetic material and antigen-based testing for viral protein identification. Host exposure is detected using antibody detection assays. While NATs require sophisticated instrument and trained manpower, antigen tests are plagued by their low sensitivity and specificity. Thus, a test offering sensitive detection for presence of infection as a colorimetric readout holds promise to enable mass testing in resource constrained environments by minimally trained personnel. Here we present a novel HRPZyme Assisted Recognition of Infection by Optical Measurement (HARIOM) assay which combines specificity of NATs with sensitivity of enzymatic assays resulting in enhanced signal to noise ratios in an easily interpretable colorimetric readout. Using this assay, we could detect up to 10(2) copies of synthetic viral RNA spiked in saliva as a detection matrix. Validating our assay on suspected human subjects, we found concordance with PCR based readouts with visible colorimetric distinction between positive and negative samples in less than an hour. We believe that this assay holds the potential to aid in mass screening to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection by facilitating colorimetric detection with minimal resources and trained personnel.","Ahmad, Mohd; Sharma, Pooja; Kamai, Asangla; Agrawal, Anurag; Faruq, Mohammed; Kulshreshtha, Ankur",Biosens Bioelectron,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34020221/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566321003171; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566321003171?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.113280,414
675288,SARS-CoV-2 Spike-Heat Shock Protein A5 (GRP78) Recognition may be Related to the Immersed Human Coronaviruses,2020-12-11,"Abstract The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are mainly characterized by a triad composed of fever, dry cough and dyspnea. However, digestive symptoms have also been reported; at first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect (to some extent) more than half of patients. The symptoms are mainly manifested by anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain. Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection. Digestive forms, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign. The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases. Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images compatible with COVID-19 infection. No data exist on the interest of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms. Moreover, the endoscopic surgeons may themselves be at significant risk of contamination. Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms. In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis. In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patient’s persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established. Upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly among previously undetected pauci-symptomatic members of a health care staff. Resumption of medico-surgical activity should be the object of a dedicated strategy preceding deconfinement.","Gornet, Jean-Marc; Linh Tran Minh, My; Leleu, Florian; Hassid, Deborah",J Visc Surg,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878788620301235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360205/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878788620301235?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2020.04.017,414
675634,Knowledge‐based structural models of SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins and their complexes with potential drugs,2020-05-25,"BACKGROUND: Although SARS-CoV-2 infection often causes milder symptoms in children and adolescents, young people might still play a key part in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. An efficacious vaccine for children and adolescents could therefore assist pandemic control. For further evaluation of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine candidate BBIBP-CorV, we assessed the safety and immunogenicity of BBIBP-CorV in participants aged 3–17 years. METHODS: A randomised, double-blind, controlled, phase 1/2 trial was done at Shangqiu City Liangyuan District Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Henan, China. In phases 1 and 2, healthy participants were stratified according to age (3–5 years, 6–12 years, or 13–17 years) and dose group. Individuals with a history of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV infection were excluded. All participants were randomly assigned, using stratified block randomisation (block size eight), to receive three doses of 2 μg, 4 μg, or 8 μg of vaccine or control (1:1:1:1) 28 days apart. The primary outcome, safety, was analysed in the safety set, which consisted of participants who had received at least one vaccination after being randomly assigned, and had any safety evaluation information. The secondary outcomes were geometric meant titre (GMT) of the neutralising antibody against infectious SARS-CoV-2 and were analysed based on the full analysis set. This study is registered with www.chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR2000032459, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Aug 14, 2020, and Sept 24, 2020, 445 participants were screened, and 288 eligible participants were randomly assigned to vaccine (n=216, 24 for each dose level [2/4/8 μg] in each of three age cohorts [3–5, 6–12, and 13–17 years]) or control (n=72, 24 for each age cohort [3–5, 6–12, and 13–17 years]) in phase 1. In phase 2, 810 participants were screened and 720 eligible participants were randomly assigned and allocated to vaccine (n=540, 60 for each dose level [2/4/8 μg] in each of three age cohorts [3–5, 6–12, and 13–17 years]) or control (n=180, 60 for each age cohort [3–5, 6–12, and 13–17 years]). The most common injection site adverse reaction was pain (ten [4%] 251 participants in all vaccination groups of the 3–5 years cohort; 23 [9·1%] of 252 participants in all vaccination groups and one [1·2%] of 84 in the control group of the 6–12 years cohort; 20 [7·9%] of 252 participants in all vaccination groups of the 13–17 years cohort). The most common systematic adverse reaction was fever (32 [12·7%] of 251 participants in all vaccination groups and six [7·1%] of 84 participants in the control group of the 3–5 years cohort; 13 [5·2%] of 252 participants in the vaccination groups and one [1·2%] of 84 in the control group of the 6–12 years cohort; 26 [10·3%] of 252 participants in all vaccination groups and eight [9·5%] of 84 in the control group of the 13–17 years cohort). Adverse reactions were mostly mild to moderate in severity. The neutralising antibody GMT against the SARS-CoV-2 virus ranged from 105·3 to 180·2 in the 3–5 years cohort, 84·1 to 168·6 in the 6–12 years cohort, and 88·0 to 155·7 in the 13–17 years cohort on day 28 after the second vaccination; and ranged from 143·5 to 224·4 in the 3–5 years cohort, 127 to 184·8 in the 6–12 years cohort, and 150·7 to 199 in the 13–17 years cohort on day 28 after the third vaccination. INTERPRETATION: The inactivated COVID-19 vaccine BBIBP-CorV is safe and well tolerated at all tested dose levels in participants aged 3–17 years. BBIBP-CorV also elicited robust humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection after two doses. Our findings support the use of a 4 μg dose and two-shot regimen BBIBP-CorV in phase 3 trials in the population younger than 18 years to further ascertain its safety and protection efficacy against COVID-19.

Certain patient populations like those with obesity and diabetes are at higher risk for acquiring severe COVID-19 disease and have a higher risk of COVID-19 associated mortality. In the absence of an effective and safe vaccine, the only immediate promising approach is to repurpose an existing approved drug. Several drugs have been proposed and tested as adjunctive therapy for COVID-19. Among these drugs are the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 2 agonists and the dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Beyond their glucose-lowering effects, these drugs have several pleiotropic protective properties, which include cardioprotective effects, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities, antifibrotic effects, antithrombotic effects, and vascular endothelial protective properties. This narrative review discusses these protective properties and addresses their scientific plausibility for their potential use as adjunctive therapy for COVID-19 disease.","Alshanwani, Aliah; Kashour, Tarek; Badr, Amira",Endocr. metab. immune disord. drug targets,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370655/; https://doi.org/10.2174/1871530321666210809153558,414

Stepwise introduction revolutionized implant introduction but lacks a last step.No guidelines exist for the introduction of a well-documented implant not previously used in a department. This is problematic according to the European Union's legislated tendering process, potentially leading to increased revisions. In this systematic review, the introduction of a well-documented total hip arthroplasty implant to experienced surgeons is explored amid concerns of higher revision rate.Literature search strategies were deployed in the Embase and Medline databases, revealing a total of 14,612 articles. Using the Covidence software (Cochrane, London), two reviewers screened articles for inclusion.No articles were found that fulfilled our eligibility criteria. A post hoc analysis retrieved two national register-based studies only missing information about the surgeon's knowledge of the introduced implant. None of the introduced implants decreased the revision rate and around 30% of the introduced implants were associated with a higher revision rate. The review showed that no data exist about revision rates when introducing well-documented implants. In continuation thereof, the introduction of well-documented implants might also be associated with increased revision rates, as has been shown for total knee arthroplasty. We therefore suggest that special attention should be focused on changes of implants in departments, which can be achieved by way of specific registration in national registers.

To describe the idea about the factors influencing the outbreak data, we presented the current situation of the COVID-19 outbreak with graphical trends. Methods: Primary data were collected and analyzed by using a pre-created Google Survey form having a pre-set questionnaire on the social distancing status of different districts. Secondary data on the total and the daily number of laboratory tests, confirmed positive cases, and death cases were extracted from the publicly available sources to make predictions. We estimated the basic reproduction number (R(◦)) based on the SIR mathematical model and predicted the probable fate of this pandemic in Bangladesh. Results: Quarantine situations in different regions of Bangladesh were evaluated and presented. We also provided tentative forecasts until 31 May 2020 and found that the predicted curve followed the actual curve approximately. Estimated R(◦)-values (6.924) indicated that infection rate would be greater than the recovery rate. Furthermore, by calibrating the parameters of the SIR model to fit the reported data, we assume the ultimate ending of the pandemic in Bangladesh by December 2022. Conclusion: We hope that the results of our analysis could contribute to the elucidation of critical aspects of this outbreak and help the concerned authority toward decision making.","Hassan, Raguib; Dosar, Abu Sayem; Mondol, Joytu Kumar; Khan, Tahmid Hassan; Noman, Abdullah Al; Sayem, Mirajus Salehin; Hasan, Moinul; Juyena, Nasrin Sultana",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330309/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.559437,414
676263,SARS coronavirus outbreaks past and present—a comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and its predecessors,2021-06-01,"COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread worldwide. Spain has suffered one of the largest nationwide bursts, particularly in the highly populated areas of Madrid and Barcelona (two of the five largest conurbations in Europe). We used segmented regression analyses to identify shifts in the evolution of the apparent reproductive number (Rt) reported for 16 Spanish administrative regions. We associate these breaking points with a timeline of key containment measures taken by national and regional governments, applying time lags for the time from contagion to case detection, with their associated errors. Results show an early decrease of Rt that preceded the nationwide lockdown; a generalized, sharp decrease in Rt associated with such lockdown; a low impact of the strengthened lockdown, with a flattening of Rt evolution in high-incidence regions regions - but increases in Rt at low-incidence regions; and an increase in Rt, associated to the relaxation of the lockdown measures, in ten regions. These results evidence the importance of generalized lockdown measures to contain COVID-19 spread; and the limited effect of the subsequent application of a stricter lockdown (restrictions to all non-essential economic activities). Most importantly, they highlight the importance of maintaining strong social distancing measures and strengthening public health control during lockdown de-escalation.","Santamaria, L.; Hortal, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.30.20117770v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.30.20117770,414

More significant the viral load during exposure, the greater is the likelihood of contracting a severe disease. Healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in airway care of COVID-19 patients are at high risk of getting exposed to large viral loads during aerosol-generating actions such as coughing or sneezing by the patient or during procedures such as bag-mask ventilation, intubation, extubation, and nebulization. This viral load exposure to airway caregivers decreases considerably with the use of an aerosol box during intubation. The safety tent proposed in this article is useful in limiting the viral load that HCWs are exposed to during airway procedures. Its role can be expanded beyond just intubation to protect against all aerosol-generating actions and procedures involving the patient's airway.","Bidkar, Prasanna; Goneppanavar, Umesh; Kaur, Jasvinder; Ramamoorthy, Srivats Valliyur",J Anaesthesiol Clin Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.4103/joacp.joacp_211_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100673/,414

This kind of analysis can be conveniently used to investigate the impact of geo-economic transformations, like fast urbanization and industrial development, which occurred in continental size countries (e.g., India, China, and Brazil) during the past half-century. Profiting from high quality data, this work explores how scaling relationships among urban indicators are influenced by strong regional heterogeneities in Brazil. It is based on economic, infrastructure and violence related data sets for the time interval 2002-2016. Results indicate that regional specificities related to infrastructure, economic development, and geography have a larger influence on the absolute value of the urban indexes. Regional scaling similarities and differences among Brazilian regions were also uncovered. Interesting enough, the results indicate that the richest and poorest Brazilian regions share similar scaling behavior, despite all huge different local influences. By contrast, the results for the two richest regions, with similar average values of urban indexes and the same kind of local influences have rather different scaling properties. Thus, scaling analysis suggests that distinct political solutions might be necessary to improve life’s quality, even for two regions with similar average values of urban indicators.","de Castro, Caio Porto; dos Santos, Gervásio Ferreira; de Freitas, Anderson Dias; dos Santos, Maria Isabel; Andrade, Roberto Fernandes Silva; Barreto, Maurício Lima",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33275604/,414

As food anti-microbials, the compounds will have to withstand the cooking process without changing to toxic compounds. With this Communication, we address the question of whether PEA and EAA are altered when heated to 73.9 °C or 93.3 °C. A combination of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry was used to analyze solutions of PEA(-HCl) or EAA in beef broth or water. In addition, the anti-microbial activity of PEA-HCl and EAA was compared between heated and unheated samples at a range of concentrations. The gas chromatograms of PEA(-HCl) and EAA showed one peak at early retention times that did not differ between the heated and unheated samples. The mass spectra for PEA and EAA were near identical to those from a spectral database and did not show any differences between the heated and unheated samples. We conclude that PEA(-HCl) and EAA formed pure solutions and were not altered during the heating process. In addition, the anti-microbial activity of PEA-HCl and EAA did not change after the heating of the compounds. Regardless of temperature, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for PEA-HCl were 20.75 mmol mL(−1) for Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium.

More specifically, to identify, organise and prioritise experiences with the way SC is conceived and practised by professionals in research and the clinic. DESIGN: Group concept mapping (GCM). SETTING: The study was conducted within a university setting in Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: Researchers, students and clinicians working with SC on a daily basis in the clinic and/or through research participated in brainstorming (n=15), sorting (n=15), rating and validation (n=13). RESULTS: Applying GCM, ideas were identified, organised and prioritised online. A total of 192 unique ideas of SC were identified and organised into six clusters. The results were discussed and interpreted at a validation meeting. Based on input from the validation meeting a conceptual model was developed. The model highlights three overall themes: (1) ‘SC as an integral but overlooked aspect of healthcare’ containing the two clusters SC as a part of healthcare and perceived significance; (2) ‘delivering SC’ containing the three clusters quality in attitude and action, relationship and help and support, and finally (3) ‘the role of spirituality’ containing a single cluster. CONCLUSION: Because spirituality is predominantly seen as a fundamental aspect of each individual human being, particularly important during suffering, SC should be an integral aspect of healthcare, although it is challenging to handle. SC involves paying attention to patients’ values and beliefs, requires adequate skills and is realised in a relationship between healthcare professional and patient founded on trust and confidence.","Hvidt, Niels Christian; Nielsen, Kristina Tomra; Kørup, Alex K; Prinds, Christina; Hansen, Dorte Gilså; Viftrup, Dorte Toudal; Assing Hvidt, Elisabeth; Hammer, Elisabeth Rokkjær; Falkø, Erik; Locher, Flemming; Boelsbjerg, Hanne Bess; Wallin, Johan Albert; Thomsen, Karsten Flemming; Schrøder, Katja; Moestrup, Lene; Nissen, Ricko Damberg; Stewart-Ferrer, Sif; Stripp, Tobias Kvist; Steenfeldt, Vibeke Østergaard; Søndergaard, Jens; Wæhrens, Eva Ejlersen",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33372078/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042142,414

MERS-CoV belongs to the Coronaviridae family and causes a zoonotic disease, MERS, with strong camel to human and weak human to human transmission. The first documented case of MERS was reported in Saudi Arabia in June 2012. Viral replication produces inflammatory markers targeting T lymphocytes, with apoptosis being the end result. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of this virus is not yet fully understood. The main symptomatic appearance is of mild lower respiratory tract infection with dyspnea and persistent cough in addition to systemic manifestations. The diagnosis is mainly based on the use of polymerase chain reaction for the detection of viral ribonucleic acid in the sputum or tracheal fluids. Otolaryngologic treatment mainly involves supportive adjuvant usage of interferon or antiviral drugs; however, approximately one-third of patients may not survive, and, therefore, otolaryngologists should be familiar with and remain mindful of the disease.","Alnemare, Ahmad K",International journal of general medicine,https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=60160; https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s252796; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32801842/,414

The single-chain of core RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase relies on virus-encoded cofactors nsp7 and two units of nsp8 for its optimum function. This study explored the FDA approved database of 7922 molecules and screened against the core polymerase along with cofactors. Here we report a panel of FDA approved drugs that show substantial interactions with key amino acid residues of the active site. Interestingly, some of the identified drugs (Ornipressin, Lypressin, Examorelin, Polymyxin B1) bind strongly within the binding pockets of both forms of RdRp. Besides, we found strong candidates for the complex form as well which include Nacortocin, Cistinexine, Cisatracurium (among others). These drugs have the potential to be considered while contriving therapeutic options.","Ahmad, Jamshaid; Ikram, Saima; Ahmad, Fawad; Rehman, Irshad Ur; Mushtaq, Maryam",Heliyon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04502; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844020313463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32754651/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844020313463?v=s5,414

Due to the sudden and urgent nature of most disasters, it is hard to make the exact prediction on the demand information. Meanwhile, timely delivery is also a problem. In this paper, taking the COVID-19 epidemic as an example, we propose an integrated method to fulfill both the demand estimation and the relief material distribution. We assume the relief supply is directed by government, so it is possible to arrange experts to evaluate the situation from aspects and coordinate supplies of different sources. The first part of the integrated method is a fuzzy decision-making process. The demand degrees on relief materials are estimated by extending COPRAS under interval 2-tuple linguistic environment. The second part includes the demand degrees as one of the inputs, conducts a hybrid distribution model to decide the allocation and routing. The key point of hybrid distribution is that each demand point could be visited by different vehicles and each vehicle could visit different demand points. Our method can also be extended to include both relief materials and medical staffs.

680895,Identifying SARS-CoV Membrane Protein Amino Acid Residues Linked to Virus-Like Particle Assembly,2013-05-20,"Similarity learning using deep convolutional neural networks has been applied extensively in solving computer vision problems. This attraction is supported by its success in one-shot and zero-shot classification applications. The advances in similarity learning are essential for smaller datasets or datasets in which few class labels exist per class such as wildlife re-identification. Improving the performance of similarity learning models comes with developing new sampling techniques and designing loss functions better suited to training similarity in neural networks. However, the impact of these advances is tested on larger datasets, with limited attention given to smaller imbalanced datasets such as those found in unique wildlife re-identification. To this end, we test the advances in loss functions for similarity learning on several animal re-identification tasks. We add two new public datasets, Nyala and Lions, to the challenge of animal re-identification. Our results are state of the art on all public datasets tested except Pandas. The achieved Top-1 Recall is 94.8% on the Zebra dataset, 72.3% on the Nyala dataset, 79.7% on the Chimps dataset and, on the Tiger dataset, it is 88.9%. For the Lion dataset, we set a new benchmark at 94.8%. We find that the best performing loss function across all datasets is generally the triplet loss; however, there is only a marginal improvement compared to the performance achieved by Proxy-NCA models. We demonstrate that no single neural network architecture combined with a loss function is best suited for all datasets, although VGG-11 may be the most robust first choice. Our results highlight the need for broader experimentation and exploration of loss functions and neural network architecture for the more challenging task, over classical benchmarks, of wildlife re-identification.","Dlamini, Nkosikhona; van Zyl, Terence L",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s21186109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577319/,414

The increased susceptibility of STAT1-deficient mice is potentially due to the lack of functional type III IFN (IFN-λ) signalling. Methods We used mice lacking functional receptors for both type I and type III IFN (dKO) to evaluate the possibility that type III IFN plays a decisive role in SARS-CoV protection. Results We found that viral peak titres in lungs of dKO and STAT1-deficient mice were similar, although significantly higher than in wild-type mice. The kinetics of viral clearance from the lung was also comparable in dKO and STAT1-deficient mice. Surprisingly, however, infected dKO mice remained healthy, whereas infected STAT1-deficient mice developed liver pathology and eventually succumbed to neurological disease. Conclusion Our data suggest that the failure of STAT1-deficient mice to efficiently control initial SARS-CoV replication in the lung is due to impaired type I and type III IFN signaling, whereas the failure to control subsequent systemic viral spread is due to unrelated defects in STAT1-deficient mice.","Mahlakoiv, T.; Ritz, D.; Enjuanes, L.; Müller, M.

Here we determined a 1.6-Å resolution crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 ExoN in complex with its essential co-factor, nsp10. The structure shows a highly basic and concave surface flanking the active site, comprising several Lys residues of nsp14 and the N-terminal amino group of nsp10. Modeling suggests that this basic patch binds to the template strand of double-stranded RNA substrates to position the 3′ end of the nascent strand in the ExoN active site, which is corroborated by mutational and computational analyses. Molecular dynamics simulations further show remarkable flexibility of multi-domain nsp14 and suggest that nsp10 stabilizes ExoN for substrate RNA-binding to support its exoribonuclease activity. Our high-resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 ExoN-nsp10 complex serves as a platform for future development of anti-coronaviral drugs or strategies to attenuate the viral virulence.","Moeller, Nicholas H.; Shi, Ke; Demir, Özlem; Banerjee, Surajit; Yin, Lulu; Belica, Christopher; Durfee, Cameron; Amaro, Rommie E.; Aihara, Hideki",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821277/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.02.438274,414

That this virus had recently infected the dogs was indicated by high anti-MVC antibody titers of their sera. No other virus commonly associated with canine gastrointestinal disease was implicated. As no previous association of MVC infection and disease in aged dogs had been described, further characterization of the isolated virus was performed to determine if it had unique pathogenic or genetic properties. Experimental infection of adult dogs did not result in clinical disease and comparison of the viral genome with other MVCs did not reveal any novel elements. The American, Japanese and Korean MVC strains studied were closely related to bocaviruses of bovine and human origin, and appeared to have evolved uniquely in the dog population after dividing from the common ancestor of bocaviruses.

684071,Advanced Analysis of Biosensor Data for SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 Interactions,2020-08-10,"BACKGROUND: Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is considered highly fatal in its naturally occurring form, although up to 36% of cats resist disease after experimental infection, suggesting that cats in nature may also resist development of FIP in the face of infection with FIP virus (FIPV). Previous experimental FIPV infection studies suggested a role for cell-mediated immunity in resistance to development of FIP. This experimental FIPV infection study in specific pathogen free (SPF) kittens describes longitudinal antiviral T cell responses and clinical outcomes ranging from rapid progression, slow progression, and resistance to disease. RESULTS: Differences in disease outcome provided an opportunity to investigate the role of T cell immunity to FIP determined by T cell subset proliferation after stimulation with different viral antigens. Reduced total white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte and T cell counts in blood were observed during primary acute infection for all experimental groups including cats that survived without clinical FIP. Antiviral T cell responses during early primary infection were also similar between cats that developed FIP and cats remaining healthy. Recovery of antiviral T cell responses during the later phase of acute infection was observed in a subset of cats that survived longer or resisted disease compared to cats showing rapid disease progression. More robust T cell responses at terminal time points were observed in lymph nodes compared to blood in cats that developed FIP. Cats that survived primary infection were challenged a second time to pathogenic FIPV and tested for antiviral T cell responses over a four week period. Nine of ten rechallenged cats did not develop FIP or T cell depletion and all cats demonstrated antiviral T cell responses at multiple time points after rechallenge. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, definitive adaptive T cell responses predictive of disease outcome were not detected during the early phase of primary FIPV infection. However emergence of antiviral T cell responses after a second exposure to FIPV, implicated cellular immunity in the control of FIPV infection and disease progression. Virus host interactions during very early stages of FIPV infection warrant further investigation to elucidate host resistance to FIP.","Mustaffa-Kamal, Farina; Liu, Hongwei; Pedersen, Niels C.; Sparger, Ellen E.",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31118053/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-1909-6,414

METHODS: This is a prospective, monocentric, longitudinal, cohort clinical study. Healthcare workers (HCW) from Strasbourg University Hospital were enrolled between April 6th and May 7th, 2020 and followed up to 422 days. Serial serum samples were tested for antibodies against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the spike protein and nucleocapsid protein (N) to characterize the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the incidence of reinfection. Live-neutralization assays were performed for a subset of samples before and after vaccination to analyze sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 variants. FINDINGS: A total of 4290 samples from 393 convalescent COVID-19 and 916 COVID-19 negative individuals were analyzed. In convalescent individuals, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies followed a triphasic kinetic model with half-lives at month (M) 11–13 of 283 days (95% CI 231–349) for anti-N and 725 days (95% CI 623–921) for anti-RBD IgG, which stabilized at a median of 1.54 log BAU/mL (95% CI 1.42–1.67). The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections was 12.22 and 0.40 per 100 person-years in COVID-19-negative and COVID-19-positive HCW, respectively, indicating a relative reduction in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection of 96.7%. Live-virus neutralization assay revealed that after one year, variants D614G and B.1.1.7, but less so B.1.351, were sensitive to anti-RBD antibodies at 1.4 log BAU/mL, while IgG ≥ 2.0 log BAU/mL strongly neutralized all three variants. These latter anti-RBD IgG titers were reached by all vaccinated HCW regardless of pre-vaccination IgG levels and type of vaccine. INTERPRETATION: Our study demonstrates a long-term persistence of anti-RBD antibodies that may reduce risk of reinfection. By significantly increasing cross-neutralizing antibody titers, a single-dose vaccination strengthens protection against variants.","Gallais, Floriane; Gantner, Pierre; Bruel, Timothée; Velay, Aurélie; Planas, Delphine; Wendling, Marie-Josée; Bayer, Sophie; Solis, Morgane; Laugel, Elodie; Reix, Nathalie; Schneider, Anne; Glady, Ludovic; Panaget, Baptiste; Collongues, Nicolas; Partisani, Marialuisa; Lessinger, Jean-Marc; Fontanet, Arnaud; Rey, David; Hansmann, Yves; Kling-Pillitteri, Laurence; Schwartz, Olivier; De Sèze, Jérome; Meyer, Nicolas; Gonzalez, Maria; Schmidt-Mutter, Catherine; Fafi-Kremer, Samira",EBioMedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34455390/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103561; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352396421003546; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352396421003546,414

The only way to minimize the number of death is to quarantine the patients tested Corona positive. The quick spread of this disease can be reduced by automatic screening to cover the lack of radiologists. Though the researchers already have done extremely well to design pioneering deep learning models for the screening of Covid-19, most of them results in low accuracy rate. In addition, over-fitting problem increases difficulties for those models to learn on existing Covid-19 datasets. In this paper, an automated Covid-19 screening model is designed to identify the patients suffering from this disease by using their chest X-ray images. The model classifies the images in three categories – Covid-19 positive, other pneumonia infection and no infection. Three learning schemes such as CNN, VGG-16 and ResNet-50 are separately used to learn the model. A standard Covid-19 radiography dataset from the repository of Kaggle is used to get the chest X-ray images. The performance of the model with all the three learning schemes has been evaluated and it shows VGG-16 performed better as compared to CNN and ResNet-50.

For non-severe COVID-19 patients affected by neurovascular diseases, the prevalence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is unknown. The aim of our study was to report data obtained after systematic Doppler ultrasound scanning (DUS) of lower limbs in such patients. METHODS: Between March 20 and May 2, 2020, the deep venous system of 13 consecutive patients diagnosed with neurovascular diseases and non-severe COVID-19 was investigated with a systematic bedside DUS. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled in the study including 9 acute ischaemic strokes, 1 occlusion of the ophthalmic artery, 1 transient ischaemic attack, 1 cerebral venous thrombosis and 1 haemorrhagic stroke. On admission, the median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was of 6 (IQR, 0–20). During the first week after admission, and despite thromboprophylaxis, we found a prevalence of 38.5% of asymptomatic calves' DVT (n = 5). One patient developed a symptomatic pulmonary embolism and 2 other patients died during hospitalization. The outcome was positive for the other patients with a discharge median NIHSS score of 1 (IQR, 0–11). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Despite thromboprophylaxis, systematic bedside DUS showed a high prevalence (38.5%) of asymptomatic DVT in non-severe COVID-19 patients suffering from a neurovascular disease. In the absence of a reliable marker of DVT, we suggest that this non-invasive investigation could be an interesting tool to monitor peripheral venous thrombotic complications in such patients.","Rouyer, Olivier; Pierre-Paul, Irène Nora; Balde, Amadou Talibe; Jupiter, Damaris; Bindila, Daniela; Geny, Bernard; Wolff, Valérie",Cerebrovasc Dis Extra,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33285543/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000513295,414

We aim to investigate healthcare staff’s mental health issues and the associated predictors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, this paper aims to identify some unique predictors of healthcare staff’s mental health issues in Iran, the second country after China to experience a major COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: An online survey of 280 healthcare staff in all 31 provinces of Iran assessed staff’s mental distress (K6), depression, and anxiety (PHQ-4) during April 5–20, 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis. RESULTS: Nearly a third of healthcare staff surpassed the cutoff for distress, depression, and anxiety symptoms. Females or more educated healthcare staff were more likely to experience distress. Those who were unsure whether they had COVID-19 were more likely to experience distress and depression symptoms. The number of COVID-19 cases among a healthcare worker’s colleagues or friends positively predicted the worker’s anxiety symptoms. Amongst healthcare staff, doctors were less likely than radiology technologists to experience distress and anxiety symptoms. Technicians and obstetrics staff experienced fewer anxiety symptoms. The age and the weekly working days of healthcare staff interacted such that age is asignificant predictor of mental health issues among younger but not older healthcare staff. CONCLUSION: The identification of the predictors of mental health issues can guide healthcare organizations to screen healthcare workers who are more likely to be mentally vulnerable in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Gong, Haitong; Zhang, Stephen X; Nawaser, Khaled; Afshar Jahanshahi, Asghar; Xu, Xingzi; Li, Jizhen; Bagheri, Afsaneh",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34007182/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s297503,414
687852,Ligand‐centered assessment of SARS‐CoV‐2 drug target models in the Protein Data Bank,2020-05-17,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopaenia (VITT) is a rare adverse effect of COVID-19 adenoviral vector vaccines1-3. VITT resembles heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia (HIT) in that it is associated with platelet-activating antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4)4; however, patients with VITT develop thrombocytopaenia and thrombosis without exposure to heparin. Here we sought to determine the binding site on PF4 of antibodies from patients with VITT. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis5, we found that the binding of anti-PF4 antibodies from patients with VITT (n = 5) was restricted to eight surface amino acids on PF4, all of which were located within the heparin-binding site, and that the binding was inhibited by heparin. By contrast, antibodies from patients with HIT (n = 10) bound to amino acids that corresponded to two different sites on PF4. Biolayer interferometry experiments also revealed that VITT anti-PF4 antibodies had a stronger binding response to PF4 and PF4-heparin complexes than did HIT anti-PF4 antibodies, albeit with similar dissociation rates. Our data indicate that VITT antibodies can mimic the effect of heparin by binding to a similar site on PF4; this allows PF4 tetramers to cluster and form immune complexes, which in turn causes FcÎ³ receptor IIa (FcÎ³RIIa; also known as CD32a)-dependent platelet activation. These results provide an explanation for VITT-antibody-induced platelet activation that could contribute to thrombosis.","Huynh, Angela; Kelton, John G; Arnold, Donald M; Daka, Mercy; Nazy, Ishac",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03744-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34233346/,414
688063,Structure-based modeling of SARS-CoV-2 peptide/HLA-A02 antigens,2020-03-27,"BACKGROUND: Preparedness for a possible global pandemic caused by viruses such as the highly pathogenic influenza A subtype H5N1 has become a global priority. In particular, it is critical to monitor the appearance of any new emerging subtypes. Comparative phyloinformatics can be used to monitor, analyze, and possibly predict the evolution of viruses. However, in order to utilize the full functionality of available analysis packages for large-scale phyloinformatics studies, a team of computer scientists, biostatisticians and virologists is needed – a requirement which cannot be fulfilled in many cases. Furthermore, the time complexities of many algorithms involved leads to prohibitive runtimes on sequential computer platforms. This has so far hindered the use of comparative phyloinformatics as a commonly applied tool in this area. RESULTS: In this paper the graphical-oriented workflow design system called Quascade and its efficient usage for comparative phyloinformatics are presented. In particular, we focus on how this task can be effectively performed in a distributed computing environment. As a proof of concept, the designed workflows are used for the phylogenetic analysis of neuraminidase of H5N1 isolates (micro level) and influenza viruses (macro level). The results of this paper are hence twofold. Firstly, this paper demonstrates the usefulness of a graphical user interface system to design and execute complex distributed workflows for large-scale phyloinformatics studies of virus genes. Secondly, the analysis of neuraminidase on different levels of complexity provides valuable insights of this virus's tendency for geographical based clustering in the phylogenetic tree and also shows the importance of glycan sites in its molecular evolution. CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates the efficiency and utility of workflow systems providing a biologist friendly approach to complex biological dataset analysis using high performance computing. In particular, the utility of the platform Quascade for deploying distributed and parallelized versions of a variety of computationally intensive phylogenetic algorithms has been shown. Secondly, the analysis of the utilized H5N1 neuraminidase datasets at macro and micro levels has clearly indicated a pattern of spatial clustering of the H5N1 viral isolates based on geographical distribution rather than temporal or host range based clustering.","Singh, Dadabhai T; Trehan, Rahul; Schmidt, Bertil; Bretschneider, Timo",BMC Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18315855/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-9-s1-s23,414
688402,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections using commercially available reagents,2020-07-09,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of inhaled epoprostenol and prone positioning, individually and in combination in mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and refractory hypoxemia. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Academic hospital adult ICUs. PATIENTS: Adult patients who received inhaled epoprostenol and prone positioning during invasive ventilation were enrolled. Patients were excluded if inhaled epoprostenol was initiated: 1) at an outside hospital, 2) after prone positioning was terminated, 3) during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and 4) with Pao(2)/Fio(2) greater than 150 mm Hg. INTERVENTIONS: Inhaled epoprostenol and prone positioning. RESULTS: Of the 43 eligible patients, 22 and seven received prone positioning and inhaled epoprostenol alone, respectively, prior to their use in combination, Pao(2)/Fio(2) was not different pre- and post-prone positioning or inhaled epoprostenol individually (89.1 [30.6] vs 97.6 [30.2] mm Hg; p = 0.393) but improved after the combined use of inhaled epoprostenol and prone positioning (84.0 [25.6] vs 124.7 [62.7] mm Hg; p < 0.001). While inhaled epoprostenol and prone positioning were instituted simultaneously in 14 patients, Pao(2)/Fio(2) was significantly improved (78.9 [27.0] vs 150.2 [56.2] mm Hg, p = 0.005) with the combination. Twenty-seven patients (63%) had greater than 20% improvement in oxygenation with the combination of inhaled epoprostenol and prone positioning, and responders had lower mortality than nonresponders (52 vs 81%; p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who had refractory hypoxemia, oxygenation improved to a greater extent with combined use of inhaled epoprostenol and prone positioning than with each treatment individually. A higher proportion of responders to combined inhaled epoprostenol and prone positioning survived compared with nonresponders. These findings need to be validated by randomized, prospective clinical trials.","Li, Jie; Fink, James B.; Augustynovich, Ashley E.; Mirza, Sara; Kallet, Richard H.; Dhand, Rajiv",Crit Care Explor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33354678/; https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000307,414
688514,Recent progress in the development of potential drugs against SARS-CoV-2,2021-09-14,"Extreme climate change is posing an increasing threat to human welfare across countries. Specifically, the devastating floods coupled with the looming spectre of drought are argued to explain cross-country differences in food security. While the debate continues and uncertainties about the precise influence of climate change on food security linger, the question of whether climate change plays a pivotal role in increased hunger and food insecurity across countries remains unanswered. This study presented new evidence of the role of climate change in Africa’s food security. We utilised the Mann–Kendall test and Sen’s slope estimator to analyse climate change trends. We also employed the pooled mean group technique and the Dumitrescu–Hurlin panel causality test to investigate the effect of climate change on food security in 15 African countries between 1970 and 2016. Our empirical findings revealed three things. First, rainfall plays a decisive role in Africa’s food security when examined broadly. However, the significance of the effect of rainfall varied substantially across the 15 countries. Second, we find no robust impact of temperature on food security in the long run. However, the short-run results showed that extreme temperatures impede food security, with varying magnitudes across countries. Third, except for rainfall, a bidirectional causality exists between food security and temperature in Africa. Given the risks associated with rain-fed agriculture, we argue that African countries need to limit their dependence on rain-fed agriculture to boost food production.","Pickson, Robert Becker; Boateng, Elliot",Environ Dev Sustain,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01621-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34276245/,414

The new teaching processes are developed today and all teachers should be prepared. Gamification is one of the methodologies with the greatest impact on the learning process. The objective of the study is to analyze the relevance and progression that the concepts “gamification” and “learning” have acquired in the scientific literature of Web of Science. This research has been based on a bibliometric methodology. A classic bibliometric and thematic analyses have been carried out. A 1230 document matrix analysis has been selected. For descriptive bibliometrics, the Bibliometrix library is used, while Scimat is used for the thematic analysis. Both tools are widely used in this type of study. Results indicate that growth on the study of these topics is booming. There are also authors who accumulate most of the documents, such as Martí Parreño. English is positioned as the predominant language. The topics studied have evolved from how classic games affect learning to the study of video games and their impact on performance. It is concluded that these types of studies are still relevant and with a great future prospect. Furthermore, research focuses especially on video games, on the effects of technology on learning and on the study of flipped learning experiences.","López-Belmonte, Jesús; Parra-González, Mª Elena; Segura-Robles, Adrián; Pozo-Sánchez, Santiago",Eur J Investig Health Psychol Educ,https://doi.org/10.3390/ejihpe10030060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34542514/,414
690109,Molecular insight into the genomic variation of SARS-CoV-2 strains from current outbreak,2021-06-18,"SARS-CoV-2 is an international public health emergency; high transmissibility and morbidity and mortality can result in the virus overwhelming health systems. Combinations of social distancing, and test, trace, and isolate strategies can reduce the number of new infections per infected individual below 1, thus driving declines in case numbers, but may be both challenging and costly. These interventions must also be maintained until development and (now likely) mass deployment of a vaccine (or therapeutics), since otherwise, many susceptible individuals are still at risk of infection. We use a simple analytical model to explore how low levels of infection, combined with vaccination, determine the trajectory to community immunity. Understanding the repercussions of the biological characteristics of the viral life cycle in this scenario is of considerable importance. We provide a simple description of this process by modelling the scenario where the effective reproduction number [Formula: see text] is maintained at 1. Since the additional complexity imposed by the strength and duration of transmission-blocking immunity is not yet clear, we use our framework to probe the impact of these uncertainties. Through intuitive analytical relations, we explore how the necessary magnitude of vaccination rates and mitigation efforts depends crucially on the durations of natural and vaccinal immunity. We also show that our framework can encompass seasonality or preexisting immunity due to epidemic dynamics prior to strong mitigation measures. Taken together, our simple conceptual model illustrates the importance of individual and vaccinal immunity for community immunity, and that the quantification of individuals immunized against SARS-CoV-2 is paramount.","Saad-Roy, Chadi M.; Levin, Simon A.; Metcalf, C.

690250,Genome Sequencing of a Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Isolate from Iraq,2021-01-28,"BACKGROUND: Although the mechanisms of adaptive immunity to pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are still unknown, the immune response to the widespread endemic coronaviruses HKU1, 229E, NL63, and OC43 provide a useful reference for understanding repeat infection risk. METHODS: Here we used data from proactive sampling carried out in New York City from fall 2016 to spring 2018. We combined weekly nasal swab collection with self-reports of respiratory symptoms from 191 participants to investigate the profile of recurring infections with endemic coronaviruses. RESULTS: During the study, 12 individuals tested positive multiple times for the same coronavirus. We found no significant difference between the probability of testing positive at least once and the probability of a recurrence for the betacoronaviruses HKU1 and OC43 at 34 weeks after enrollment/first infection. We also found no significant association between repeat infections and symptom severity, but found strong association between symptom severity and belonging to the same family. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that reinfections with the same endemic coronavirus are not atypical in a time window shorter than 1 year and that the genetic basis of innate immune response may be a greater determinant of infection severity than immune memory acquired after a previous infection.","Galanti, Marta; Shaman, Jeffrey",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32692346/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa392,414
690283,MUTATION RATES AND SELECTION ON SYNONYMOUS MUTATIONS IN SARS-COV-2,2021-01-14,"SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are advancing into human clinical trials, with emphasis on eliciting high titres of neutralising antibodies against the viral spike (S). However, the merits of broadly targeting S versus focusing antibody onto the smaller receptor binding domain (RBD) are unclear. Here we assess prototypic S and RBD subunit vaccines in homologous or heterologous prime-boost regimens in mice and non-human primates. We find S is highly immunogenic in mice, while the comparatively poor immunogenicity of RBD is associated with limiting germinal centre and T follicular helper cell activity. Boosting S-primed mice with either S or RBD significantly augments neutralising titres, with RBD-focussing driving moderate improvement in serum neutralisation. In contrast, both S and RBD vaccines are comparably immunogenic in macaques, eliciting serological neutralising activity that generally exceed levels in convalescent humans. These studies confirm recombinant S proteins as promising vaccine candidates and highlight multiple pathways to achieving potent serological neutralisation.","Tan, Hyon-Xhi; Juno, Jennifer A.; Lee, Wen Shi; Barber-Axthelm, Isaac; Kelly, Hannah G.; Wragg, Kathleen M.; Esterbauer, Robyn; Amarasena, Thakshila; Mordant, Francesca L.; Subbarao, Kanta; Kent, Stephen J.; Wheatley, Adam K.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33658497/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21665-8,414
