11329,Interventions to Improve Antiretroviral Therapy Adherence Among Adolescents and Youth in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review 2015–2019,2020-03-09,"Chronic hepatitis B is caused by prolonged infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which can substantially increase the risk of developing liver disease. Despite the development of preventive vaccines against HBV, a therapeutic vaccine inducing an effective antibody response still remains elusive. The preS1 domain of the large HBV surface protein is the major viral attachment site on hepatocytes and thus offers a therapeutic target; however, its poor immunogenicity limits clinical translation. Here, we design a ferritin nanoparticle vaccine that can deliver preS1 to specific myeloid cells, including SIGNR1(+) dendritic cells (which activate T follicular helper cells) and lymphatic sinus-associated SIGNR1(+) macrophages (which can activate B cells). This nanoparticle vaccine induces a high-level and persistent anti-preS1 response that results in efficient viral clearance and partial serological conversion in a chronic HBV mouse model, offering a promising translatable vaccination strategy for the functional cure of chronic hepatitis B.","Wang, Wenjun; Zhou, Xiaoxiao; Bian, Yingjie; Wang, Shan; Chai, Qian; Guo, Zhenqian; Wang, Zhenni; Zhu, Ping; Peng, Hua; Yan, Xiyun; Li, Wenhui; Fu, Yang-Xin; Zhu, Mingzhao",Nat Nanotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223715/,530

12596,"Developing Effective Methods for Electronic Health Personalization: Protocol for Health Telescope, a Prospective Interventional Study",2020-07-31,"The transient receptor potential-melastatin 8 (TRPM8) is a non-selective Ca(2+)-permeable channel, activated by cold, membrane depolarization, and different cooling compounds. TRPM8 expression has been found in gut mucosal, submucosal, and muscular nerve endings. Although TRPM8 plays a role in pathological conditions, being involved in visceral pain and inflammation, the physiological functions in the digestive system remain unclear as yet. The aims of the present study were: (i) to verify the TRPM8 expression in human distal colon; (ii) to examine the effects of TRPM8 activation on colonic contractility; (iii) to characterize the mechanism of action. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting were used to analyze TRPM8 expression. The responses of human colon circular strips to different TRPM8 agonists [1-[Dialkyl-phosphinoyl]-alkane (DAPA) 2–5, 1-[Diisopropyl-phosphinoyl]-alkane (DIPA) 1–7, DIPA 1–8, DIPA 1–9, DIPA 1–10, and DIPA 1–12) were recorded using a vertical organ bath. The biomolecular analysis revealed gene and protein expression of TRPM8 in both mucosal and smooth muscle layers. All the agonists tested, except-DIPA 1–12, produced a concentration-dependent decrease in spontaneous contraction amplitude. The effect was significantly antagonized by 5-benzyloxytryptamine, a TRPM8 antagonist. The DIPA 1–8 agonist resulted in the most efficacious and potent activation among the tested molecules. The DIPA 1–8 effects were not affected by tetrodotoxin, a neural blocker, but they were significantly reduced by tetraethylammonium chloride, a non-selective blocker of K(+) channels. Moreover, iberiotoxin, a blocker of the large-conductance Ca(2+)-dependent K(+)-channels, but not apamin, a blocker of small-conductance Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) channels, significantly reduced the inhibitory DIPA 1–8 actions. The results of the present study demonstrated that TRPM8 receptors are also expressed in human distal colon in healthy conditions and that ligand-dependent TRPM8 activation is able to reduce the colonic spontaneous motility, probably by the opening of the large-conductance Ca(2+)-dependent K(+)-channels.","Amato, Antonella; Terzo, Simona; Lentini, Laura; Marchesa, Pierenrico; Mulè, Flavia",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7432081/,530
14591,Decision Support Capabilities of Telemedicine in Emergency Prehospital Care: Systematic Review,2020-12-08,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major pathogen causing respiratory tract infections in infants and young children. The aim of this study was to confirm the genetic evolution of RSV causing respiratory infections in children at Daejeon in Korea, through G gene analysis of RSV-A and RSV-B strains that were prevalent from 2017 to 2019. METHODS: Pediatric patients admitted for lower respiratory tract infections at The Catholic University of Korea Daejeon St. Mary's Hospital in the 2017 and 2018/2019 RSV seasonal epidemics, who had RSV detected via multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were included. The nucleic acid containing RSV-RNA isolated from each of the patients' nasal discharge during standard multiplex PCR testing was stored. The G gene was sequenced and phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGA X program and the genotype was confirmed. RESULTS: A total of 155 specimens including 49 specimens from 2017 and 106 specimens from 2018-2019 were tested. The genotype was confirmed in 18 specimens (RSV-A:RSV-B = 4:14) from 2017 and 8 specimens (RSV-A:RSV-B = 7:1) from 2018/2019. In the phylogenetic analysis, all RSV-A type showed ON1 genotype and RSV-B showed BA9 genotype. CONCLUSION: RSV-B belonging to BA9 in 2017, and RSV-A belonging to ON1 genotype in 2018/2019 was the most prevalent circulating genotypes during the two RSV seasons in Daejeon, Korea.","Kang, Hyun Mi; Park, Ki Cheol; Park, Joonhong; Kil, Hong Ryang; Yang, Eun Ae",J Korean Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7752254/,530

15123,"The effect of social media usage on the mental well-being of medical college students in Bangalore, Karnataka",2020-11-30,"Fructus Aurantii (FA) is a traditional herbal medicine that has been widely used for thousands of years in China and possesses a variety of pharmacological effects. However, the active ingredients in FA and the potential mechanisms of its therapeutic effects have not been fully explored. Here, we applied a network pharmacology approach to explore the potential mechanisms of FA. We identified 5 active compounds from FA and a total of 209 potential targets to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (PTGS2), heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), cell division protein kinase 6 (CDK6), caspase 3 (CASP3), apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 (Bcl-2), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) were identified as key targets of FA in the treatment of multiple diseases. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment demonstrated that FA was highly related to transcription initiation from RNA polymerase II promoter, DNA-templated transcription, positive regulation of transcription, regulation of apoptosis process, and regulation of cell proliferation. Various signaling pathways involved in the treatment of FA were identified, including pathways in cancer and pathways specifically related to prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, PI3K-Akt, apoptosis, and non-small-cell lung cancer. TP53, AKT1, caspase 3, MAPK3, PTGS2, and BAX/BCL2 were related key targets in the identified enriched pathways and the PPI network. In addition, our molecular docking results showed that the bioactive compounds in FA can tightly bind to most target proteins. This article reveals via network pharmacology research the possible mechanism(s) by which FA exerts its activities in the treatment of various diseases and lays a foundation for further experiments and the development of a rational clinical application of FA.","Jin, Qionglong; Lu, Jie; Gao, Renhui; Xu, Jiaying; Pan, Xiaoyan; Wang, Lichang",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7843179/,530
15741,The Need for Ethnoracial Equity in Artificial Intelligence for Diabetes Management: Review and Recommendations,2021-02-10,"BACKGROUND: Ophthalmology authors in mainland China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan were interested in knowing their individual research achievements (IRAs). This study was to evaluate the most cited authors, institutes, and regions in the mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan in the field of ophthalmology in the recent 10 years using the hx-index and to display the result with visual representations. METHODS: Using the PubMed search engine to download data, we conducted an observational study of citation analyses in affiliated research institutes and regions (provinces/areas) of all ophthalmology authors since 2010. A total of 19,364 published articles from 22,393 authors in the mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan were analyzed. The x-index and the Kano model were complemental to the hx-index in identifying IRAs. A pyramid plot was used to illustrate the importance of the author-weighted scheme (AWS) used in evaluating IRAs in academics. The hx-index combining both advantages of the h and x-index was proposed to assess individual IRAs. Furthermore, we drew: 1. a choropleth map on Google Maps to visualize the differences of IRA among regions and 2. a visual display to present individual hx-indexes. RESULTS: There is a significant rise over time in the number of publications. The top-ranking regions in hx-index were Shanghai (26.82), Guangdong (25.82), and Beijing (25.81). We demonstrated that Dr Wu from Taiwan published 144 articles in PMC and used the example to explain the importance of AWS when IRAs were assessed. CONCLUSIONS: With an overall increase in publications in the field of ophthalmology, contributions assessed by hx-indexes and the AWS should be encouraged and promoted more in the future.","Yeh, Yu-Tsen; Chien, Tsair-Wei; Kan, Wei-Chih; Kuo, Shu-Chun",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7909150/,530
15894,Efficacy of Smart Speaker–Based Metamemory Training in Older Adults: Case-Control Cohort Study,2021-02-16,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease is a significant cause of morbidity and socioeconomic burden worldwide among young children. The majority of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) and mortality occurs in developing countries and is associated with various sociodemographic risk factors. Independent risk factors for severe RSV disease include age and premature birth. While RSV mortality in developed countries is lower relative to developing countries, high-risk infants with comorbidities experience higher rates of mortality. RSV LRTI is often severe and is associated with hospitalization, increased need for intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation, long-term complications, and caregiver stress and loss of work productivity. Overall, these factors translate to higher health care resource utilization and costs and should be factored into the consideration for RSV prophylaxis. Multiple vaccine candidates and long-acting monoclonal antibodies are in various stages of clinical development. Currently, palivizumab is the only approved RSV immunoprophylaxis available for use in specific high-risk pediatric populations. This review will discuss the socioeconomic impact and health care resource utilization of RSV-related hospitalization (RSVH) as well as various sociodemographic risk factors that can be used to identify children at high risk of developing severe RSV disease.","Young, Michal; Smitherman, Lynn",Infect Dis Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7926081/,530
16354,Inpatient dental care,2021-03-26,"OBJECTIVE: To compare effects of a language intervention on Cuddler and parent adult word counts (AWC), and to compare Cuddler versus parent and nurse-care times. DESIGN: Prospective pilot cohort intervention study. Twelve Cuddler-low-visit (≤2/week) infant pairs and 17 high-visit (≥3/week) parent–infant pairs were enrolled. Each had a 16-hour baseline recording (R1) followed by a language curriculum with linguistic feedback and an outcome recording (R2) 1 week later. Bivariate group analyses and longitudinal negative binomial regressions were run. RESULTS: After the intervention, there were non-significant increases in AWC/h for Cuddlers and high-visit parents. Cuddler AWCs were similar to high-visit parents and significantly higher than nurse-care times on both recordings. Within the low-visit group, hourly AWCs were higher when Cuddlers were present versus absent (R1 = 1779 versus 552, R2 = 2530 versus 534, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: NICU language environments are different for low-visit and high-visit infants and Cuddlers can increase infant language exposure in the NICU.","Hersey, Alicia; Hoffman, Laurie; Tucker, Richard; Vohr, Betty",J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7995673/,530

Fibropapillomatosis is an expanding virally and environmentally co-induced sea turtle tumor epizootic. Chelonid herpesvirus 5 (ChHV5) is implicated as a causative virus, but its transmission method and specific role in oncogenesis and progression is unclear. We applied environmental (e)DNA-based viral monitoring to assess viral shedding as a direct means of transmission, and the relationship between tumor burden, surgical resection and ChHV5 shedding. To elucidate the abundance and transcriptional status of ChHV5 across early, established, regrowth and internal tumors we conducted genomics and transcriptomics. We determined that ChHV5 is shed into the water column, representing a likely transmission route, and revealed novel temporal shedding dynamics and tumor burden correlations. ChHV5 was more abundant in the water column than in marine leeches. We also revealed that ChHV5 is latent in fibropapillomatosis, including early stage, regrowth and internal tumors; higher viral transcription is not indicative of poor patient outcome, and high ChHV5 loads predominantly arise from latent virus. These results expand our knowledge of the cellular and shedding dynamics of ChHV5 and can provide insights into temporal transmission dynamics and viral oncogenesis not readily investigable in tumors of terrestrial species.","Farrell, Jessica A.; Yetsko, Kelsey; Whitmore, Liam; Whilde, Jenny; Eastman, Catherine B.; Ramia, Devon Rollinson; Thomas, Rachel; Linser, Paul; Creer, Simon; Burkhalter, Brooke; Schnitzler, Christine; Duffy, David J.",Commun Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8115626/,530
17662,Initial Outcomes of Transdiagnostic Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Tailored to Public Safety Personnel: Longitudinal Observational Study,2021-05-05,"BACKGROUND: To verify the association between weekly leisure walking time and positive self-rated health in the Brazilian adult and elderly population. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used information collected in 2019 across all regions of Brazil. This study included 25,785 people aged ≥ 18 years (mean = 51.6; standard deviation = 18.0) from all capitals of the Brazilian states who reported practicing walking as physical activity during leisure time. Self-rated health was the dependent variable (positive or negative). The leisure walking time/week was the main exposure and it was categorized in “150 minutes/week”, “150–299 minutes/week” and “≥ 300 minutes/week”. We used binary logistic regression to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) that was adjusted for relevant covariates. RESULTS: We found that individuals who reported leisure walking for a period from 150 to 299 minutes/week and those who reported walking for a period ≥ 300 minutes/week were respectively 28% (OR = 1.28. 95% CI [1.10–1.48]) and 52% (OR = 1.52. 95% CI [1.27–1.82]) more likely of perceiving their health positively compared to those who reported walking for a period < 150 minutes/week. Individuals who reported leisure walking time <150 minutes/week had 72.3% (95% CI [70.4–74.1]) probability of perceiving their health positively. Individuals who reported leisure walking time from 150 to 299 minutes/week had 76.6% (95% CI [75.0 –78.3) probability of perceiving their health positively. On the other hand, individuals who reported leisure walking time ≥ 300 minutes/week had 79.2% probability (95% CI [77.1–81.4]) of perceiving their health positively. CONCLUSION: Longer leisure walking time was associated with positive self-rated health among adults and older adults in Brazil.","Silva, Diego Augusto Santos",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136276/,530

We previously documented that APP occurs at baseline conditions, while it is hindered by neurotoxicant administration. This is bound to the activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), since APP is stimulated by mTOR inhibition, which in turn, is correlated with cell protection. In this brief report, we provide novel morphological and biochemical evidence on APP, suggesting the presence of active UP subunits within ATG vacuoles. Although a stream of interpretation considers such a merging as a catabolic pathway to clear inactive UP subunits, our data further indicate that UP-ATG merging may rather provide an empowered catalytic organelle.","Limanaqi, Fiona; Biagioni, Francesca; Salvetti, Alessandra; Puglisi-Allegra, Stefano; Lenzi, Paola; Fornai, Francesco",Eur J Histochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8200839/,530
19273,The economic value of changing mortality risk in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic breakdown by cause of death,2021-07-16,"IMPORTANCE: Emergency departments (EDs) sporadically use a high-dose buprenorphine induction strategy for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) in response to the increasing potency of the illicit opioid drug supply and commonly encountered delays in access to follow-up care. OBJECTIVE: To examine the safety and tolerability of high-dose (>12 mg) buprenorphine induction for patients with OUD presenting to an ED. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this case series of ED encounters, data were manually abstracted from electronic health records for all ED patients with OUD treated with buprenorphine at a single, urban, safety-net hospital in Oakland, California, for the calendar year 2018. Data analysis was performed from April 2020 to March 2021. INTERVENTIONS: ED physicians and advanced practice practitioners were trained on a high-dose sublingual buprenorphine induction protocol, which was then clinically implemented. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Vital signs; use of supplemental oxygen; the presence of precipitated withdrawal, sedation, and respiratory depression; adverse events; length of stay; and hospitalization during and 24 hours after the ED visit were reported according to total sublingual buprenorphine dose (range, 2 to >28 mg). RESULTS: Among a total of 391 unique patients (median [interquartile range] age, 36 [29-48] years), representing 579 encounters, 267 (68.3%) were male and 170 were (43.5%) Black. Homelessness (88 patients [22.5%]) and psychiatric disorders (161 patients [41.2%]) were common. A high dose of sublingual buprenorphine (>12 mg) was administered by 54 unique clinicians during 366 (63.2%) encounters, including 138 doses (23.8%) greater than or equal to 28 mg. No cases of respiratory depression or sedation were reported. All 5 (0.8%) cases of precipitated withdrawal had no association with dose; 4 cases occurred after doses of 8 mg of buprenorphine. Three serious adverse events unrelated to buprenorphine were identified. Nausea or vomiting was rare (2%-6% of cases). The median (interquartile range) length of stay was 2.4 (1.6-3.75) hours. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that high-dose buprenorphine induction, adopted by multiple clinicians in a single-site urban ED, was safe and well tolerated in patients with untreated OUD. Further prospective investigations conducted in multiple sites would enhance these findings.","Herring, Andrew A.; Vosooghi, Aidan A.; Luftig, Joshua; Anderson, Erik S.; Zhao, Xiwen; Dziura, James; Hawk, Kathryn F.; McCormack, Ryan P.; Saxon, Andrew; D’Onofrio, Gail",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8283555/,530

Despite this success, high rates of sunburn continue to be reported by youth and young adults. As such, new strategies to reinforce sun protection approaches in this demographic are needed. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a virtual reality (VR) game containing preventive skin cancer messaging and to assess the safety and satisfaction of the design based on end user feedback. METHODS: Using a two-phase design approach, we created a prototype VR game that immersed the player inside the human body while being confronted with growing cancer cells. The first design phase involved defining the problem, identifying stakeholders, choosing the technology platform, brainstorming, and designing esthetic elements. In the second design phase, we tested the prototype VR experience with stakeholders and end users in focus groups and interviews, with feedback incorporated into refining and improving the design. RESULTS: The focus groups and interviews were conducted with 18 participants. Qualitative feedback indicated high levels of satisfaction, with all participants reporting the VR game as engaging. A total of 11% (2/8) of participants reported a side effect of feeling nauseous during the experience. The end user feedback identified game improvements, suggesting an extended multistage experience with visual transitions to other environments and interactions involving cancer causation. The implementation of the VR game identified challenges in sharing VR equipment and hygiene issues. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents key findings highlighting the design and implementation approaches for a VR health intervention primarily aimed at improving sun protection behaviors. This design approach can be applied to other health prevention programs in the future.","Horsham, Caitlin; Dutton-Regester, Ken; Antrobus, Jodie; Goldston, Andrew; Price, Harley; Ford, Helen; Hacker, Elke",JMIR Serious Games,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8294638/,530

METHOD: Fifty-eight patients experiencing severe fatigue will be randomized to a CBT group or usual care group. The intervention will be given for 6 sessions by a trained oncology nurse. Primary and secondary outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, the sixth week of intervention and at the third month post intervention. The primary outcome measure is fatigue (Brief Fatigue Inventory) and secondary outcome measures include depression (Patient Health Questionnaire) and quality of life (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire). The protocol is designed using the SPIRIT guidelines which is one of the EQUATOR checklists. DISCUSSION: This is the first RCT that will determine the efficacy of CBT by integrating with activity pacing to reduce fatigue among breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. The intervention design is novel in addressing multiple precipitating and perpetuating factors of fatigue and integrated with activity pacing in CBT. CONCLUSION: If the intervention is effective, this therapeutic approach can be incorporated into a routine health care for breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.

Understanding the impacts of health awareness and behaviors on transmission dynamics of syphilis can help to establish optimal control strategy in different regions. In this paper, we develop a multiple-stage SIRS epidemic model taking into account the public health awareness and behaviors of syphilis. First, the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] is obtained, which determines the global dynamics behaviors of the model. We derive the necessary conditions for implementing optimal control and the corresponding optimal solution for mitigation syphilis by using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Based on the data of syphilis in Ningxia from 2006 to 2018, the parameterizations and model calibration are carried out. The fitting results are in good agreement with the data. Moreover, sensitivity analysis shows that the public awareness induced protective behaviors C(e), compliance of condom-induced preventability ε and treatment for the primary syphilis m(1) play an important role in mitigating the risk of syphilis outbreaks. These results can help us gain insights into the epidemiology of syphilis and provide guidance for the public health authorities to implement health education programs.","Jing, Wenjun; Ma, Ning; Liu, Weichen; Zhao, Yu",Infect Dis Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8455652/,530

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of consecutive patients at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR between February 28, 2020 and May 3, 2020. We obtained demographic and clinical data including coinfections, antimicrobial use and outcomes at 30 days after diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 60 patients reviewed, the median age was 62 years (range 22–98) and 43% were male. 34 (57%) patients had solid tumors and 16 (27%) hematologic malignancies. Breast (12%), colorectal (8%) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (8%) were the most prevalent cancers. 34 (57%) had ≥ 2 comorbidities. The majority of identified exposures were from long-term care facilities (LTCF) (27%) or household contacts (25%) (Fig 1). The most common symptoms at diagnosis were cough (72%), fevers/chills (57%), shortness of breath (38%), nasal congestion/rhinorrhea (35%), and diarrhea (30%). 18 (31%) patients were prescribed at least one course of antibiotics within 30 days of diagnosis; antibiotics were prescribed to 54% of hospitalized patients (Fig 2). 6 (10%) had a documented bacterial infection; of these, 3 were respiratory coinfections. No viral or fungal copathogens were reported. 26 (43%) patients were hospitalized, 9 (15%) admitted to intensive care, and one (2%) required mechanical ventilation. 12 (20%) died within 30 days of diagnosis (Fig 3); of these, 10 (83%) had ≥ 2 comorbidities and 8 (67%) had LTCF exposure. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in cancer patients, particularly among older age groups with multiple comorbidities and those with LTCF exposure. More than half of cases appeared to acquire SARS-CoV-2 from LTCF or household exposures, indicating need for infection prevention and family/caregiver education. Despite few documented bacterial coinfections, antibiotic use within 30 days of diagnosis was common and likely empiric due to limited diagnostics in the era of COVID-19. DISCLOSURES: Steven A.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the pathogen through challenge infection assays and partial sequencing of the genome of the pathogen. A 453-bp amplicon was obtained by random PCR using the nucleic acid extracted from the tissue homogenate filtrate and showed 32% identity at the amino acid level with the replicase polyprotein of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus by Blastx. Multiple alignments indicated the putative protein sequence has some similarities to the replicase polyprotein of Arteriviridae, and the phylogenetic tree showed it was closely related to equine arteritis virus. This sequence was found in the lung of the diseased P. sinensis by in situ hybridization. Dot blot hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR showed that the lung had the highest content of virus. The peak replication of P. sinensis hemorrhagic syndrome virus (TSHSV) in the lung occurred 4 days after infection. The ribonucleic nature of the viral genome was confirmed by RNase A or DNase I treatments. We named the virus TSHSV in this study as P. sinensis is also known as Trionyx sinensis. These results provide a fundamental basis for further understanding the biology and the molecular mechanisms of TSHSV.","Liu, Li; Cao, Zheng; Lin, Feng; Ye, Xue-ping; Xu, Yi",Intervirology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000437354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26279281/,530

METHODS Mothers of 572 infants (46% girls) aged 1-12 months (M = 5.9, standard deviation = 2.9) participated. Assessments were conducted on 4 occasions from late March to May 2020. Infant sleep was measured objectively using auto-videosomnography. Mothers reported their sheltering status, demographic characteristics, and infant sleep. RESULTS Infants of mothers in home confinement had later sleep offset times and longer nighttime sleep durations, compared to infants of mothers who were working as usual. At the end of March, these infants also had earlier bedtimes, more nighttime awakenings, and more parental nighttime visits, but differences were not apparent during April and May. CONCLUSIONS Living restrictions issued in the United States may have led to longer sleep durations and temporary delays in sleep consolidation for infants of mothers in home confinement.","Kahn, Michal; Barnett, Natalie; Glazer, Assaf; Gradisar, Michael",Sleep health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2020.11.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243718/,530

74762,Machine learning health-related applications in low-income and middle-income countries: a scoping review protocol.,2020-05-10,"PURPOSE Radiofrequency ablation for liver tumors (liver RFA) is widely performed under ultrasound guidance. However, discriminating between the tumor and the needle is often difficult because of cavitation caused by RFA-induced coagulation. An unclear ultrasound image can lead to complications and tumor residue. Therefore, image-guided navigation systems based on fiducial registration have been developed. Fiducial points are usually set on a patient's skin. But the use of internal fiducial points can improve the accuracy of navigation. In this study, a new device is introduced to use internal fiducial points using 2D US. METHODS 3D Slicer as the navigation software, Polaris Vicra as the position sensor, and two target tumors in a 3D abdominal phantom as puncture targets were used. Also, a new device that makes it possible to obtain tracking coordinates in the body was invented. First, two-dimensional reslice images from the CT images using 3D Slicer were built. A virtual needle was displayed on the two-dimensional reslice image, reflecting the movement of the actual needle after fiducial registration. A phantom experiment using three sets of fiducial point configurations: one conventional case using only surface points, and two cases in which the center of the target tumor was selected as a fiducial point was performed. For each configuration, one surgeon punctured each target tumor ten times under guidance from the 3D Slicer display. Finally, a statistical analysis examining the puncture error was performed. RESULTS The puncture error for each target tumor decreased significantly when the center of the target tumor was included as one of the fiducial points, compared with when only surface points were used. CONCLUSION This study introduces a new device to use internal fiducial points and suggests that the accuracy of image-guided navigation systems for liver RFA can be improved by using the new device.","Doba, Nobutaka; Fukuda, Hiroyuki; Numata, Kazushi; Hao, Yoshiteru; Hara, Kouji; Nozaki, Akito; Kondo, Masaaki; Chuma, Makoto; Tanaka, Katsuaki; Takebayashi, Shigeo; Koizumi, Norihiro; Kobayashi, Akira; Tokuda, Junichi; Maeda, Shin",International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-017-1647-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28718001/,530
83286,A systematic review and meta-analysis of postpartum contraceptive use among women in low- and middle-income countries.,2019,"Sludge dewatering is an important step for wastewater treatment. Composite degradable flocculant (CDF) was prepared by cationic polyacrylamide (PAM) grafting onto modified starch with a novel initiator, and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The microstructure of flocculated sludge was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The study investigated the properties of CDF compared to PAM, which showed that the prepared CDF exhibited a highly effective flocculation on sludge dewatering, a higher transmittance and chemical oxygen demand removal rate, and a lower value of effluent ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus. The fermentation process was also analyzed by testing the performance of dewatered sludge (temperature, pH, ammonia nitrogen, E4/E6 (humic acid absorbance at 465 nm (E4) and 665 nm (E6))). The dehydrated sludge with CDF could be easily compressed into cakes by belt-filter for easy transportation and storage. With the continuous addition of CDF and PAM, the corresponding index of capillary suction time (CST) increased. Moreover, the total value of CST with CDF was low, showing a good dewaterability. In addition, the sludge index of pumping time and moisture content with CDF were low in contrast with PAM. Fermentation experiments demonstrated that sludge with CDF had a comparatively high temperature and low value of E4/E6. Such novel CDF shows enormous potential in wastewater treatment and sludge fermentation.","Liu, Jianbo; Jia, Shouhao; Xu, Liming; Zhu, Feifei; Ren, Shan; Liu, Yuanfeng; Sun, Ziqi",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2020.464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263583/,530
84216,Broken jaws in the COVID era.,2020-04-01,"Background Hypoglycemia is a common, symptom seen in individuals. Hypoglycemia in the elderly is both under-recognized and misdiagnosed due to nonspesific hypoglycemic symptoms and accompanying comorbidities in this population. In diabetic individuals, hypoglycemia is most commonly caused by administering insulin or sulphonylureas and insulin secretagogues. Other drugs, such as antibiotics or beta-blockers, have been reported to reduce blood glucose to abnormally low levels. Hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients is considered a rare event, and the possible reasons may be reactive hypoglycemia, insulin-secreting tumours and other malignancies, hypopituitarism, hypocortisolism, alcohol abuse, inappropriate insulin self-administration, malnutrition, renal failure and sepsis. Case An 86- year- old male was admitted to the emergency department with hypoglycemia diagnosed with non-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (NET) on lung secreting insulin. No surgical intervention or chemotherapy was planned due to patients age and comorbidities so best supportive care was planned. We used prednisone for symptomatic treatment of hypoglycemia and the patient has been followed up periodically. In this period he had no hypoglycemic attack. Conclusion For patients with hypoglycemia who are unable/decline to receive any further treatment, low dose glucocorticoid is a good choice to achieve normoglycemia. It seems to be more cost effective compared to other treatment options. Furthermore hospitalisation rates may decrease due to decreased hypogylcemic attacks.","Eren, Merve; Bostan, Feyzi",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v20i4.44; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394252/,530

85466,Interventions to improve school-based eye-care services in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review.,2018,"BACKGROUND The relationship between intraoperative low bispectral index (BIS) values and poor clinical outcomes has been controversial. Intraoperative hypotension is associated with postoperative complication. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of intraoperative low BIS values and hypotension on postoperative mortality in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. METHODS This retrospective study analyzed 1862 cases of general anesthesia. We collected the cumulative time of BIS values below 20 and 40 as well as electroencephalographic suppression and documented the incidences in which these states were maintained for at least 5 min. Durations of intraoperative mean arterial pressures (MAP) less than 50 mmHg were also recorded. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between suspected risk factors and postoperative mortality. RESULTS Ninety-day mortality and 180-day mortality were 1.5 and 3.2% respectively. The cumulative time in minutes for BIS values falling below 40 coupled with MAP falling below 50 mmHg was associated with 90-day mortality (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.53; P = .019). We found no association between BIS related values and 180-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS The cumulative duration of BIS values less than 40 concurrent with MAP less than 50 mmHg was associated with 90-day postoperative mortality, not 180-day postoperative mortality.","Yoon, Soohyuk; Yoo, Seokha; Hur, Min; Park, Sun-Kyung; Lee, Hyung-Chul; Jung, Chul-Woo; Bahk, Jae-Hyon; Kim, Jin-Tae",BMC anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-020-01122-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32795266/,530

Methods Randomized and non-randomized studies assessing the relationship between healthcare quality domains and EHR/CPOE provider price display published between 1/1/1980 to 2/1/2018 were included. MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase were searched. Assessment of internal validity of the included studies was performed with a modified Downs-Black checklist. Results Screening of 1118 abstracts was performed resulting in selection of 41 manuscripts for full length review. A total of 13 studies were included in the final analysis. Thirteen studies reported on efficiency domain, one on effectiveness and one on patient safety. Studies assessing relationship between provider price display and patient centered, equitable and timely care domains were not retrieved. Quality of the studies varied widely (Range 6-12 out of a maximum possible score of 13). Provider price display in electronic health record environment did not consistently influence domains of healthcare quality such as efficiency, effectiveness and patient safety. Conclusions Published evidence suggests that price display tools aimed at ordering providers in EHR/CPOE do not influence the efficiency domain of healthcare quality. Scant published evidence suggests that they do not influence the effectiveness and patient safety domains of healthcare quality. Future studies are needed to assess the relationship between provider price display and unexplored domains of healthcare quality (patient centered, equitable, and timely care).

90397,Productivity loss due to menstruation-related symptoms: a nationwide cross-sectional survey among 32 748 women.,2019,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is associated with a high risk of disability and mortality. The objective of this study was to investigate prognostic factors in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion treated with mechanical thrombectomy, focusing on collateral status and recanalization time from symptom onset. METHODS Eligible patients from January 2012 to October 2019 who underwent endovascular treatment due to acute BAO were reviewed. The baseline posterior circulation collateral status was assessed with the basilar artery on computed tomography angiography score and posterior circulation collateral score. Good outcomes were defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of ≤2 at 3 months and successful recanalization as Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction grades 2b, 3. The associations between baseline and clinical parameters and favorable outcomes were evaluated with logistic regression. RESULTS Our sample included a total of 81 eligible patients (49 males, mean age 70.3 years) with a median baseline and discharge National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 12. Patients with good outcomes showed a lower baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, a greater proportion of distal BAO, and a higher basilar artery on computed tomography angiography and posterior circulation collateral score (P<0.001). According to subgroup analysis of patients within and over 6 or 12 hours, the time from symptom onset to recanalization was not correlated with good outcomes. Multivariable logistic analysis showed baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale <15 (odds ratio, 8.49 [95% CI, 2.01-35.82]; P=0.004), posterior circulation collateral score ≥6 (odds ratio, 3.79 [95% CI, 1.05-13.66]; P=0.042), and distal BAO (odds ratio, 3.67 [95% CI, 1.10-12.26]; P=0.035) were independent predictors of good outcomes. CONCLUSIONS This study suggested that good collateral circulation and distal BAO are independent predictors of clinical outcome after endovascular treatment in patients with acute BAO. In particular, patients with good initial collateral status and distal BAO may consider endovascular treatment even if the treatment is started beyond the standard time limits.","Kwak, Hyo Sung; Park, Jung Soo",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.029861; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32568658/,530

The goal was to bring together key stakeholders in global healthcare outreach to explore a flexible framework and sustainable business model that can leverage telemedicine and information technology (IT) to expand healthcare services internationally. Dr. Hon S. Pak, President of the ATA, opened the forum with a call for collaboration and partnership, and encouraged continued international dialogue to create a framework that leverages the telemedicine community to improve global disparity in healthcare. Keynote addresses included speakers from the World Health Organization (UN) and United Nations (UN) Global Alliance for Information and Communities Technologies and Development (GAID). Presentations from 15 government and nongovernment aid organizations (NGOs) and 12 international programs covered 5 key areas: (1) NGO perspective; (2) governmental/military programs; (3) financial sustainability; (4) disaster response; and (5) emerging opportunities. The forum resulted in an International Roadmap for Action that was developed by the authors based on the presentations and interactions from the 335 attendees and establishing a set of priorities and actions to improve healthcare using telemedicine and IT. Recommendations include: (1) continued dialogue in creating a telemedicine framework; (2) identification and leverage of resources; (3) provision of education to funding organization and expand training programs to build competency in the healthcare workforce; (4) alignment of international policy to support integration of telemedicine into country plans and support cross-country partnerships; (5) development of communications infrastructure; and (6) integration of telemedicine into disaster relief programs.","Pak, Hon S; Brown-Connolly, Nancy E; Bloch, Carolyn; Clarke, Malcolm; Clyburn, Conrad; Doarn, Charles R; Llewellyn, Craig; Merrell, Ronald C; Montgomery, Kevin; Rasche, Jeanette; Sullivan, Bradley",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2008.0030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18570571/,530
102752,Maternal and neonatal data collection systems in low- and middle-income countries: scoping review protocol.,2020,"Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) is an edible, cost-effective and widely used derivative of cellulose. Under lyotropic conditions in water, HPC forms a photonic, liquid crystalline mesophase with an exceptional mechanochromic response. However, due to insufficient physical cross-linking photonic HPC can flow freely as a viscous liquid, preventing the exploitation of this mechanochromic material in the absence of any external encapsulation or structural confinement. Here this challenge is addressed by mixing HPC and gelatin in water to form a self-supporting, viscoelastic, and edible supramolecular photonic hydrogel. It is demonstrated that the structural coloration, mechanochromism and non-Newtonian shear-thinning behavior of the lyotropic HPC solutions can all be retained into the gel state. Moreover, the rigidity of the HPC-gel provides a 69% shorter mechanochromic relaxation time back to its initial color when compared to the liquid HPC-water only system, broadening the dynamic color range of HPC by approximately 2.5× in response to a compressive pressure. Finally, the ability to formulate the HPC-gels in a scalable fashion from only water and ""food-grade"" constituents unlocks a wide range of potential applications, from response-tunable mechanochromic materials and colorant-free food decoration, to short-term sensors in, for example, biodegradable ""smart labels"" for food packaging.","Barty-King, Charles H; Chan, Chun Lam Clement; Parker, Richard M; Bay, Mélanie M; Vadrucci, Roberto; De Volder, Michael; Vignolini, Silvia",Advanced materials,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202102112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323315/,530

Endosomal escape is regarded as a critical and determining step devoted a significant number of studies of the drug/gene delivery field. AREAS COVERED This paper critically reviews the fundamental properties of chloroquine (CQ), its pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical applications and the present knowledge of CQ application as an endosomal escape enhancing agent. Different approaches to enhance the endosomal escape process of nanoparticles have been introduced including use of endosomal escape enhancing agents. Application of CQ as either a pre-treatment modality in which cells or animals are exposed to CQ prior to the main treatment or a component of co-delivery systems where CQ and other anti-cancer agents are simultaneously entered the cancer cells, is discussed with recent studies. EXPERT OPINION CQ is founded to intervene with the natural process of endosomal maturation. Moreover, CQ seems to increase the effectiveness of gene delivery by its electrostatic interaction with negatively charged components of the transferred genetic molecules. Endosomal escape might be regarded as the bottleneck of efficient gene delivery and CQ as an effective and available endosomal escape enhancing agent deserves more sophisticated studies.","Hajimolaali, Mohammad; Mohammadian, Hosein; Torabi, Ali; Shirini, Amin; Khalife Shal, Mostafa; Barazandeh Nezhad, Hami; Iranpour, Sheida; Baradaran Eftekhari, Reza; Dorkoosh, Farid",Expert opinion on drug delivery,https://doi.org/10.1080/17425247.2021.1873272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33455479/,530

To optimally integrate patients' preferences, define and prioritise realistic treatment goals and individualise care, a patient-centred approach is recommended. However, the preferences of older patients, who are especially vulnerable and frequently multimorbid, have not been systematically investigated with regard to their health status. The purpose of this evidence map is to explore current research addressing health-related preferences of older patients with multimorbidity, and to identify the knowledge clusters and research gaps. METHODS AND ANALYSIS To identify relevant research, we will conduct searches in the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, CINAHL, Social Science Citation Index, Social Science Citation Index Expanded and the Cochrane library from their inception. We will check reference lists of relevant articles and carry out cited reference research (forward citation tracking). Two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts, check full texts for eligibility and extract the data. Any disagreement will be resolved and consensus reached with the help of a third reviewer. We will include both qualitative and quantitative studies, and address preferences from the patients' perspectives in a multimorbid population of 60 years or older. There will be no restrictions on the publication language. Data extraction tables will present study and patient characteristics, aim of study, methods used to identify preferences and outcomes (ie, type of preferences). We will summarise the data using tables and figures (ie, bubble plot) to present the research landscape and to describe clusters and gaps.

We estimate (i) the time and treatment scale-up required to achieve the World Health Organization's HCV elimination target of an 80% reduction in incidence; and (ii) the ongoing frequency of HCV testing and harm reduction coverage among people who inject drugs (PWID) required to minimize the likelihood of future HCV outbreaks occurring. METHODS We used a dynamic compartmental model of HCV transmission, liver disease progression and the HCV cascade of care, calibrated to reproduce the epidemic of HCV in Iceland. The model was stratified according to injecting drug use status, age and stage of engagement. Four scenarios were considered for the projections. RESULTS The model estimated that an 80% reduction in domestic HCV incidence was achievable by 2030, 2025 or 2020 if a minimum of 55/1,000, 75/1,000 and 188/1,000 PWID were treated per year, respectively (a total of 22, 30 and 75 of the estimated 400 PWID in Iceland per year, respectively). Regardless of time frame, this required an increased number of PWID to be diagnosed to generate enough treatment demand, or a 20% scale-up of harm reduction services to complement treatment-as-prevention incidence reductions. When DAA scale-up was combined with annual antibody testing of PWID, the incidence reduction target was reached by 2024. Treatment scale-up with no other changes to current testing and harm reduction services reduced the basic reproduction number of HCV from 1.08 to 0.59, indicating that future outbreaks would be unlikely. CONCLUSION HCV elimination in Iceland is achievable by 2020 with some additional screening of PWID. Maintaining current monitoring and harm reduction services while providing ongoing access to DAA therapy for people diagnosed with HCV would ensure that outbreaks are unlikely to occur once elimination targets have been reached. LAY SUMMARY In Iceland, a nationwide program has been launched offering treatment for the entire population living with hepatitis C virus (HCV). A mathematical model was used to estimate the additional health system requirements to achieve the HCV elimination targets of the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as the year that this could occur. With some additional screening of people who inject drugs, Iceland could reach the WHO targets by 2020, becoming one of the first countries to achieve HCV elimination. The model estimated that once elimination targets were reached, maintaining current monitoring and harm reduction services while providing ongoing access to DAA therapy for people diagnosed with HCV would ensure that future HCV outbreaks are unlikely to occur.","Scott, Nick; Ólafsson, Sigurður; Gottfreðsson, Magnús; Tyrfingsson, Thorarinn; Rúnarsdóttir, Valgerdur; Hansdottir, Ingunn; Hernandez, Ubaldo Benitez; Sigmundsdóttir, Guðrún; Hellard, Margaret",Journal of hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2017.12.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29274408/,530

125319,Investigation of mental health among hospital workers in the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study.,2020-10-09,"INTRODUCTION Swine are often regarded as having analogous facial skeletons to humans and therefore serve as an ideal animal model for translational investigation. However, there is a dearth of literature describing the pertinent ancillary procedures required for craniomaxillofacial research. With this in mind, our objective was to evaluate all necessary procedures required for perioperative management and animal safety related to experimental craniomaxillofacial surgical procedures such as orthotopic, maxillofacial transplantation. METHODS Miniature swine (n = 9) were used to investigate perioperative airway management, methods for providing nutrition, and long-dwelling intravenous access. Flap perfusion using near-infrared laser angiography and facial nerve assessment with electromyoneurography were explored. RESULTS Bivona tracheostomy was deemed appropriate versus Shiley because soft, wire-reinforced tubing reduced the incidence of tracheal necrosis. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, as opposed to esophagostomy, provided a reliable route for postoperative feeding. Femoral venous access with dorsal tunneling proved to be an ideal option being far from pertinent neck vessels. Laser angiography was beneficial for real-time evaluation of graft perfusion. Facial electromyoneurography techniques for tracing capture were found most optimal using percutaneous leads near the oral commissure.Experience shows that ancillary procedures are critical, and malpositioning of devices may lead to irreversible sequelae with premature animal death. CONCLUSIONS Face-jaw-teeth transplantation in swine is a complicated procedure that demands special attention to airway, feeding, and intravascular access. It is critical that each ancillary procedure be performed by a dedicated team familiar with relevant anatomy and protocol. Emphasis should be placed on secure skin-level fixation for all tube/lines to minimize risk for dislodgement. A reliable veterinarian team is invaluable and critical for long-term success.","Al-Rakan, Mohammed; Shores, Jaimie T; Bonawitz, Steve; Santiago, Gabriel; Christensen, Joani M; Grant, Gerald; Murphy, Ryan J; Basafa, Ehsan; Armand, Mehran; Otovic, Pete; Eller, Sue; Brandacher, Gerald; Gordon, Chad R",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/scs.0000000000000935; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25377964/,530

Although current interest is high, the topic is not new, and some of the earliest public health literature includes reports on infectious disease and sanitation in rural places. Continuing through the first third of the 20th century, dozens of articles documented rural disparities in infant and maternal mortality, sanitation and water safety, health care access, and among Black, Indigenous, and People of Color communities. Current rural research reveals similar challenges, and strategies suggested for addressing rural-urban health disparities 100 years ago resonate today. This article examines rural public health literature from a century ago and its connections to contemporary rural health disparities. We describe parallels between current and historical rural public health challenges and discuss how strategies proposed in the early 20th century may inform current policy and practice. As we explore the new frontier of rural public health, it is critical to consider enduring rural challenges and how to ensure that proposed solutions translate into actual health improvements.

The aim of this study was to compare short-term outcomes of laparoscopic and open resection for gastric cancer at a single Western institution. SUBJECTS AND METHODS This study was designed as a matched cohort study from a prospective gastric cancer database. Forty-one patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer between June 2008 and January 2012 were matched with 41 patients undergoing open gastrectomy in the same time period. Patient pairing was done according to age, gender, type of gastrectomy (subtotal or total), and tumor stage via a randomized statistical method. The short-term outcomes and oncologic adequacy of the laparoscopic and open procedures were compared. A D2 lymph node dissection was performed in the majority of patients in both groups. RESULTS The two study groups were similar with respect to patient and tumor characteristics. Laparoscopic procedures were associated with a decreased blood loss (118.7 versus 312.4 mL, P<.005), incidence of surgery-unrelated complications (3 versus 9 patients, P<.05), and duration of hospital stay (8.1 versus 11.5 days, P<.05) but increased operative time for both subtotal (223.5 versus 158.2 minutes, P<.001) and total (298.1 versus 185.5 minutes, P<.001) gastrectomies. The mean number of retrieved lymph nodes after D2 dissection was similar: 30.0 for laparoscopic and 29.7 for open patients. CONCLUSIONS Within the limitations of a nonrandomized analysis, this study shows that the laparoscopic approach is a safe and oncologically adequate option for the treatment of gastric cancer, which compares favorably with open gastrectomy in short-term outcomes.","Cianchi, Fabio; Qirici, Etleva; Trallori, Giacomo; Macrì, Giuseppe; Indennitate, Giampiero; Ortolani, Manuela; Paoli, Beatrice; Biagini, Maria Rosa; Galli, Andrea; Messerini, Luca; Mallardi, Beatrice; Badii, Benedetta; Staderini, Fabio; Perigli, Giuliano",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

132111,mHealth interventions targeting pregnancy intakes in low and lower-middle income countries: Systematic review.,2019,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Sepsis is a leading cause of maternal death, and developing diagnostic tests for infection is increasingly important to reduce maternal mortality. The existing inflammatory markers, like C-reactive protein, are not specific for infection, which introduces diagnostic uncertainty. Procalcitonin (PCT) is used to accurately diagnose bacterial sepsis and differentiate it from other conditions, which is now particularly important given the vulnerability to COVID-19 in pregnancy. There are few studies of PCT in pregnancy as the reference interval for pregnant women is unknown. This study aimed to define the pregnancy-specific reference interval for PCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cross-sectional study of 323 healthy pregnant women, with longitudinal sampling in each trimester. RESULTS The upper reference limit for PCT was 0.05 ng/mL and did not vary materially between any observed group of gestational age, body mass index, maternal age, mean arterial blood pressure or fetal sex. CONCLUSION Our study has shown that levels of PCT are similar in pregnant and non-pregnant populations despite the physiological changes of normal pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy should not preclude the use of PCT in pregnant women with suspected sepsis, or for guiding antibiotic therapy in women with a diagnosed bacterial infection at any stage of pregnancy.","Dockree, Samuel; Brook, Jennifer; James, Tim; Shine, Brian; Vatish, Manu",Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.12.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33307062/,530

BACKGROUND Chronic pain is the most common complication of inguinal hernioplasty. One of the causes may be the use of sutures to secure the mesh. METHODS Adult male patients undergoing Lichtenstein hernioplasty for a primary unilateral inguinal hernia were randomized to a self-gripping polyester mesh or a sutured polyester mesh. Follow-up took place after 2 weeks, 3, 12, and 24 months. Pain and quality of life were assessed using the Verbal Rating Scale, Visual Analog Scale, and Short Form 36. CPIP was defined as moderate pain lasting at least 3 months postoperatively. RESULTS There were 165 patients in the Progrip mesh group and 166 patients in the sutured mesh group. The incidence of CPIP was 7.3% at 3 months declining to 4.6% at 24 months and did not differ between both groups. Pain and quality of life scores were significantly improved after 2 years. Hernia recurrence rate after 24 months was 2.4% for the Progrip mesh and 1.8% for the sutured mesh (P = 0.213). The mean duration of surgery was significant shorter with the Progrip mesh (44 vs 53 minutes, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The self-gripping Progrip mesh does not reduce CPIP rates. Outcomes of the Progrip mesh are comparable to the Lichtenstein technique with the additional advantage of a reduced operation time.

The purpose of this retrospective study is to explore feasibility, safety and efficacy of tunneled peritoneal catheter placement using both peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis catheters in the palliation of MA. Methods Between October 2013-June 2016, thirty patients with resistent MA underwent tunneled peritoneal catheterisation in our interventional radiology department. Tunneled peritoneal catheter (TPC) was placed in 22 (n=22/30; %73) patients, tunneled hemodialysis catheter (THC) was placed in 8 patients (n=8/30; %27). Routine visits were scheduled for months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 of the catheterization, and the records were evaluated retrospectively. Results The overall duration of catheterization varied from 2 to 334 days (mean 66.4 ± 68.5, median: 57 days). Catheters remained intact in 29 patients (96.7%) until the endpoint.

143399,Youth self-harm in low- and middle-income countries: Systematic review of the risk and protective factors.,2017,"Electrotherapy or electrical stimulation (ES) is a part of clinical intervention in the rehabilitation field. With rehabilitation intervention, electrotherapy may be provided as a treatment for pain relief, strengthening, muscle education, wound recovery, or functional training. Although these interventions may not be considered as the primary therapy for patients, the advantages of the ease of operation, lower costs, and lower risks render ES to be applied frequently in clinics. There have also been emerging ES tools for brain modulation in the past decade. ES interventions are not only considered analgesics but also as an important assistive therapy for motor improvement in orthopedic and neurological rehabilitation. In addition, during the coronavirus disease pandemic, lockdowns and self-quarantine policies have led to the discontinuation of orthopedic and neurological rehabilitation interventions. Therefore, the feasibility and effectiveness of home-based electrotherapy may provide opportunities for the prevention of deterioration or extension of the original therapy. The most common at-home applications in previous studies showed positive effects on pain relief, functional ES, muscle establishment, and motor training. Currently, there is a lack of certain products for at-home brain modulation; however, transcranial direct current stimulation has shown the potential of future home-based rehabilitation due to its relatively small and simple design. We have organized the features and applications of ES tools and expect the future potential of remote therapy during the viral pandemic.","Chen, Po-Yin; Cheen, Jang-Rong; Jheng, Ying-Chun; Wu, Hsiao-Kuan; Huang, Shih-En; Kao, Chung-Lan",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,https://doi.org/10.1097/jcma.0000000000000634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34643619/,530

The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for RVF after LAR for rectal cancer. METHODS This was a retrospective multi-institution study of 371 female rectal cancer patients who underwent LAR with anastomosis between January 2007 and December 2011. Patient-, tumor-, and surgery-related variables were examined by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS The overall RVF rate was 3.0 % (11/371). The RVF was diagnosed on median postoperative day 83 (15-766). In 81.8 % (9/11) of the patients, the diagnosis of RVF was made after hospital discharge. Multivariate analysis identified prognostic nutritional index (PNI; odds ratio (OR) 6.97; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.47-33.08; P = 0.015), preoperative chemotherapy (OR 27.31; CI 3.49-213.62; P = 0.002), tumor size (OR 5.90; CI 1.04-33.47; P = 0.045), intraoperative bleeding (OR 13.91; CI 1.34-144.42; P = 0.027), and lateral lymph node dissection (OR 4.92; CI 1.02-23.63; P = 0.045) as independent risk factors for RVF after LAR.

Elderly patients are at increased risk of PHN. The pathophysiology of PHN is complex, likely involving both peripheral and central processes. This complexity may create opportunities for pharmacologic interventions with multiple differing mechanisms of action. Consequently, complementary combinations of pharmacologic agents are frequently more effective than any monotherapy. Current US and international guidelines on the care of patients with PHN are reviewed and interpreted here to facilitate their effective incorporation into the practice of primary care physicians, acknowledging the contrasts that often exist between the clinical trial populations analyzed to craft so-called evidence-based medicine and the individual patients seen in daily practice, many of whom may not have been candidates for those clinical trials. First-line treatments for PHN include tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin and pregabalin, and the topical lidocaine 5% patch. Opioids, tramadol, capsaicin cream, and the capsaicin 8% patch are recommended as either second- or third-line therapies in different guidelines. Therapies that have demonstrated effectiveness for other types of neuropathic pain are discussed, such as serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproic acid, and botulinum toxin. Invasive procedures such as sympathetic blockade, intrathecal steroids, and implantable spinal cord stimulators have been studied for relief of PHN, mainly in patients refractory to noninvasive pharmacologic interventions. The main guidelines considered here are those issued by the American Academy of Neurology for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (2004) and general guidelines for the treatment of neuropathic pain issued by the Special Interest Group on Neuropathic Pain of the International Association for the Study of Pain (2007) and the European Federation of Neurological Societies (2010).","Argoff, Charles E",Postgraduate medicine,https://doi.org/10.3810/pgm.2011.09.2469; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21904096/,530

Under these conditions, the level of reactive oxygen species is increased and it is more likely that free-radical damage to biomolecules is caused by the process of free-radical fragmentation than oxidation. In contrast to the oxidation process, free-radical fragmentation reactions are more effectively inhibited by oxidizing agents than reducing agents. Therefore, the use of substances possessing both reducing and oxidizing properties, such as natural and synthetic quinones, bioflavonoids, curcuminoids, should reduce the probability of biomolecule destruction by oxidation as well as free-radical fragmentation processes.HighlightsCOVID-19 is accompanied by the iron release from the heme and «silent» hypoxiaROS initiate fragmentation reactions of biomolecules under conditions of hypoxiaBlocking of fragmentation process by oxidizers may lead to mitigation of COVID-19.","Shadyro, Oleg; Samovich, Svetlana; Edimecheva, Irina; Novitsky, Roman; Khrutskin, Valery; Ihnatovich, Lana; Boreko, Eugene; Dubovik, Boris",Free radical research,https://doi.org/10.1080/10715762.2021.1938024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34085882/,530

METHODS Data were pooled from seven randomized, double-blind VERTIS phase 3 trials that evaluated ertugliflozin (5 mg and 15 mg) versus non-ertugliflozin (placebo, glimepiride, or sitagliptin) treatment in patients with T2DM. Change from baseline at week 52 of treatment in alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST, respectively) serum levels (overall and categorized into tertiles by baseline ALT and AST), Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and body weight were evaluated, along with the association between changes in ALT and AST and changes in HbA1c and body weight by treatment. RESULTS Baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment groups (ertugliflozin 5 mg, n = 1716; ertugliflozin 15 mg, n = 1693; non-ertugliflozin, n = 1450). At week 52 of treatment, serum levels of ALT and AST were reduced in patients in the ertugliflozin treatment groups (5 and 15 mg, respectively) compared with those in the non-ertugliflozin group. The comparator-adjusted mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) difference in change from baseline at week 52 for ALT was - 3.35 (- 4.40, - 2.31) IU/L for ertugliflozin 5 mg and - 4.08 (- 5.13, - 3.03) IU/L for ertugliflozin 15 mg; for AST, the respective values were - 1.81 (- 2.50, - 1.11) IU/L and - 2.12 (- 2.82, - 1.42) IU/L. The effects of ertugliflozin were detected across all baseline ALT and AST tertiles, with the highest tertile showing the greatest treatment differences. No meaningful differences were observed between treatment groups for FIB-4. Changes in ALT and AST showed a weak but statistically significant association with changes in HbA1c and body weight in all treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS Treatment with ertugliflozin resulted in a reduction in the levels of hepatic transaminases compared with the non-ertugliflozin group after 52 weeks of treatment. Changes in body weight and HbA1c contributed at least in part to the effects of ertugliflozin on liver enzymes.

161985,Investigating the use of ultrasonography for the antenatal diagnosis of structural congenital anomalies in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review.,2020,"BACKGROUND & AIMS The evidence of benefiting from a high-quality diet for knee osteoarthritis (OA) joint structures, symptoms, and systemic abnormalities is limited. Clarifying the relationship between diet quality and knee OA could provide useful information for knee OA management. To investigate the associations between diet quality and knee joint structures, symptoms, lower limb muscle strength, depressive symptoms, and quality of life in people with knee OA. METHODS This study was a post-hoc, exploratory analysis using data from a randomized controlled trial in symptomatic knee OA participants with a follow-up time of 24 months. In brief, eligible participants of the original study were aged 50-79 years, had symptomatic knee OA, and had a pain of 20-80 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale. After excluding the patients without information on diet quality, 392 participants were included in this post-hoc analysis. Diet quality was assessed at baseline using the Australian Recommended Food Score (ARFS) which includes subscores of vegetable, fruit, grain, dairy products, fat, and alcohol. Knee joint structures (including cartilage volume, cartilage defect, bone marrow lesions, and effusion-synovitis volume assessed by magnetic resonance imaging), OA symptoms, lower limb muscle strength, depressive symptoms, and quality of life were assessed at baseline and follow up. Mixed-effects models were used to assess the associations of diet quality with those outcomes. RESULTS Diet quality mainly reflect diet variety within the core food was not associated with knee structures and OA symptoms, but was associated with greater lower limb muscle strength (β = 0.66, P = 0.001), lower depressive symptom (β = -0.08, P = 0.001), and better quality of life (β = -0.06, P = 0.002). In further analyses of food group-based sub-scores, only the vegetable sub-score had the similar associations with lower limb muscle strength (β = 1.03, P = 0.004), depressive symptom (β = -0.17, P < 0.001), and quality of life (β = -0.14, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Higher diet quality, mainly vegetable diet quality, is associated with greater lower limb muscle strength, less depressive symptoms, and higher quality of life in knee OA patients, suggesting higher diet quality may have protective effects on knee OA.","Ruan, Guangfeng; Yang, Chengliang; Meng, Tao; Zheng, Shuang; Zhang, Yan; Zhu, Jimin; Cen, Han; Wang, Yuanyuan; Zhu, Zhaohua; Han, Weiyu; Tang, Yujin; Liu, Jia; Antony, Benny; Winzenberg, Tania; Wluka, Anita E; Cicuttini, Flavia; Ding, Changhai",Clinical nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.03.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932790/,530

Template switching plays crucial roles in retroviral replication and recombination, is used for adapter addition in RNA-seq, and may contribute to retroelement fitness by enabling continuous cDNA synthesis on damaged templates. Here, we determined an X-ray crystal structure of a template-switching complex of a group II intron RT bound simultaneously to an acceptor RNA and donor RNA template/DNA heteroduplex with a 1-nt 3’-DNA overhang. The latter mimics a completed cDNA after non-templated addition (NTA) of a nucleotide complementary to the 3’ nucleotide of the acceptor as required for efficient template switching. The structure showed that the 3’ end of the acceptor RNA binds in a pocket formed by an N-terminal extension (NTE) present in non-long-terminal-repeat (LTR)-retroelement RTs and the RT fingertips loop, with the 3’ nucleotide of the acceptor base paired to the 1-nt 3’-DNA overhang and its penultimate nucleotide base paired to the incoming dNTP at the RT active site. Analysis of structure-guided mutations identified amino acids that contribute to acceptor RNA binding and a phenylalanine near the RT active site that mediates NTA. Mutation of the latter residue decreased multiple sequential template switches in RNA-seq. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of template switching and NTA by RTs, suggest how these reactions could be improved for RNA-seq, and reveal common structural features for template switching by non-LTR-retroelement RTs and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.","Lentzsch, Alfred M.; Stamos, Jennifer L.; Yao, Jun; Russell, Rick; Lambowitz, Alan M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.13.443781,530

174616,A cross-sectional study of the association between frequency of telecommuting and unhealthy dietary habits among Japanese workers during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-07-01,"the past decade has been witnessing a considerable technological evolution, gearing companies towards a constant competitive sense. One of the ways to maintain a competitive edge has been the adoption of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems to streamline business processes, therefore setting a high demand for ERP professionals. Although universities have ERP in their curricula, there is still a skill mismatch regarding ERP skills with industry. Existing teaching methods for ERP consists of numerous challenges that must be addressed to ensure learning and skill acquisition take place. Furthermore, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the populace to revert to online behaviors, including online teaching. This paper proposes a gaming approach to ERP teaching, with the aim of complementing existing traditional teaching methods, if not replace them. The game exposes the user to basic concepts through online lectures and then engages the user in different types of games such as crosswords, quizzes, scenario-based games and a simulation game. This game was experimented with a group of university students from the University of Mauritius who already had exposure to an ERP related subject. Overall, the game was much appreciated by the students and they were positive about its implementation in the teaching curriculum that is gradually metamorphosing into distance learning. © 2021 IEEE.","Jheengut, K.; Cauleechurn, D.; Cadersaib, Z.","9th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology, ICoICT 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/icoict52021.2021.9527497,530
177699,Eco-friendly practices and pro-environmental behaviours: the Australian folk and world music festival perspective,2021,"In response to the food crisis threat due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Indonesian Government initiates a national food supply enhancement program recognized as food estate which was then established as a part of National Strategic Programs. To maintain its implementation, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry through PermenLHK 24/2020 allows the legalization of forest land utilization, including the protected forest land for the food estate program. This study aims to analyze emerging conflict norms related to the utilization of the protected forest in Indonesia’s food estate program. The method used is normative legal research conducted by reviewing various forestry-related legal instruments and principles in Indonesia. The main findings reveal that the legalization of the utilization of protected forests for food estate projects by PermenLHK 24/2020 does not meet legal certainty and contradicts the norms incorporated in the hierarchical higher related regulations. In connection to climate change, the legalization of utilizing protected forests for the food estate program will open up opportunities for deforestation and encourage degradation of the protected function of these forests. The forestry sector has become one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Indonesia, with deforestation and land degradation as the root of the problem. The implication of food estate becomes a regressive action for the realization of Indonesia’s commitment to reduce GHG emissions from the forestry sector up to 17.2% with unconditional mitigation scenario (CM 1) and 23% with conditional mitigation scenario (CM 2) by 2030.","Maskun, Napang M.; Nur, S.

179188,Adverse Skin Reactions to Personal Protective Equipment among Health-Care Workers during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multicenter Cross-sectional Study in Indonesia,2021,"Since the beginning of the New Year 2020, countries around the world are stumbling due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Better approaches of diagnostics and medical facilities have helped some countries recover early. Previous exposures to epidemics have imparted lessons to handle such a pandemic with a high level of preparedness. The World Health Organization (WHO) and national health authorities are taking great efforts via efficient and impactful interventions to contain the virus. Diagnostic tests such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction are increasingly being used to confirm the diagnosis because testing biological samples for the presence of the virus is the definitive method to identify the disease, analyze the risk for transmission, and determine whether someone has been cured or not. It is also important to screen asymptomatic individuals to get the exact overview of the virus spread. Antibody detection plays a pivotal role in diagnosis; however, using it at the wrong time yields negative results and conveys dissenting opinion about the tests. Although the scaling up of testing has been significant, overall testing has been limited by the availability of diagnostics. Rapid diagnoses and discontinuation of transmission are keys to ending this pandemic. Diagnostics manufacturers are developing test kits and distributing them to different countries. Therefore, more than 500 commercial test kits for molecular- and immunoassays, most with Emergency Use Authorization, are now becoming available in the market. In this review, we discuss the importance of diagnostics, approaches of different countries toward the epidemic, global testing situation, and lessons to countries at the start of the epidemic for better preparedness.","Ravichandran, Karthikeyan; Anbazhagan, Subbaiyan; Singh, Shiv Varan; Agri, Himani; Rupner, Ramkumar N.; Rajendran, Vinodh Kumar Obli; Dhama, Kuldeep; Singh, Bhoj Raj",J.

183544,Feasibility of Pediatric Non-Invasive Respiratory Support in Low and Middle-Income Countries.,2021-05-03,"• Status of PASi across China's paddy fields is quantified on a national scale. • Natural and anthropogenic factors control the spatial distribution of PASi content. • At least 65% of China's paddy fields are deficient in PASi. • The principal regions where PASi deficit are mainly located in southern China. • PASi content of China's paddy fields decreases with an annual rate of 0.54%. Silicon (Si) is beneficial for rice health and production by alleviating various biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the continual export of grain off-farm may result in Si deficiency for rice plants. The current levels of plant available Si (PASi) in rice paddies in China remain unclear, as do the factors that control PASi content in these soils. We conducted a nationwide sampling campaign across the paddy fields of China between 2016 and 2019, and used calcium chloride extractable Si (Si-CaCl 2) and buffered acetate extractable Si (Si-NaAc, pH = 4) to quantify PASi. We show that Si-CaCl 2 pool was mainly influenced by mean annual temperature (MAT), soil salinity, soil organic carbon (SOC), mean annual precipitation (MAP), and soil pH, suggesting both pedological and biological control mechanisms. However, the Si-NaAc pool was influenced most by soil pH, MAT and MAP, implying pedological control. Compared to data from the 1990s, the Si-NaAc content decreased by 14.1% on a national scale with an annual decline rate of 0.54%. Based on our investigation, at least 65% of China's paddy fields are deficient in PASi, which is an increase in area of ~15% over the last 20 years. The principal regions where PASi deficiency was recorded are mainly located in southern China, with the levels of Si deficiency lowering as the paddy fields are located further north. The continual off-site removal of PASi from rice grain and straw will need to be addressed through the use of Si-fertilizers, including organic amendments, to maintain a productive and sustainable rice industry in China.

We discuss the stability and developmental trajectories of cognitive functions, their main predictors, the complex interplay between environmental and genetic predictors, and the relationships between the different domains of cognition from birth to adulthood.","Guez, Ava; Peyre, Hugo; Williams, Camille; Labouret, Ghislaine; Ramus, Franck",Cognition,,530

The aim of this study was to determine the factors associated with neonatal death in cases of gastroschisis managed in a tertiary hospital in Brazil. It was included 49 cases of gastroschisis managed at IMIP, Recife - Brazil, between 1995 and 2001. The dependent variable was neonatal death and the independent variables were: prenatal diagnosis, route and site of delivery, gestational age, birthweight, birth-to-admission interval, birth-to-surgery interval, primary or staged-silo repair, need of mechanical ventilation and postoperative infection. Prevalence ratio (PR) and its 95% confidence interval of neonatal death was determined. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine adjusted relative risk of neonatal death. Overall mortality was 53% (26 cases) and infection was the main cause of death (92%). Prenatal diagnosis was associated with significant reduction of 74% in the risk of death. This risk was significantly increased ( > twice) among newborns with gestational age below 37 weeks, birthweight below 2.5Kg and outborn babies. A significantly greater risk of neonatal death was observed for birth-to-admission interval of 2h or more and birth-to-surgery interval of 4h or more (2.5 and 3.4 times, respectively). Need of mechanical ventilation was associated with an increased risk of death (2.6 times). In multivariate analysis, variables that persisted strongly associated to neonatal death were gestational age below 37 weeks and birth-to-surgery interval greater than 4h. A high mortality was observed among babies of gastroschisis which is explained by factors like absence of prenatal diagnosis, prematurity, low birthweight, delivery outside the tertiary center, longer birth-to-surgery intervals and need of mechanical ventilation.","Carvalho Vilela, Paulo; Maria Ramos de Amorim, Melania; Hanois Falbo Neto, Gilliatt; Carlos Santos, Luiz; Ventura Henriques Santos, Ricardo; Correia, Cláudia",Acta cir. bras.,,530
230353,The Differential Outcomes of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Low- and Middle-Income Countries vs High-Income Countries,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. As this disease continues to spread worldwide, it has posed enormous challenges on the healthcare of several diseases, especially cancer, because hospital facilities have invested health resources for patients with COVID-19. Indeed, patients with lung cancer are particularly vulnerable because of their poor baseline lung function and cancer-related treatment. In addition, once infected, they are at an increased risk of pulmonary complications from COVID-19. Oncologists are thus facing a challenge as how to balance the treatment plans to control the disease while protecting the patients with lung cancer from COVID-19. In fact, it is crucial to provide individualized treatment recommendations to limit the risks during these difficult times. This review highlights the key challenges that oncologists face when diagnosing COVID-19 among patients with lung cancer and examines the current recommendations from available literature, clinical expertise, and expert opinions regarding managing lung cancer in the era of COVID-19. It also explores the treatment approach recommended for patients with lung cancer while avoiding putting them at excessive risk of contracting COVID-19 infection.","Khalifeh, Yara Ibrahim; Tfayli, Arafat Hussein",Turk Thorac J,,530
234013,Differential impact of COVID-19 in pregnant women from high-income countries and low- to middle-income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The whole world is still struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic. Inflammation response, thought to be associated with severe illness and death, is an important research topic in COVID-19. Inflammation is also an essential condition explored in psychiatric illnesses. Our knowledge about the relationship between the inflammation response and psychiatric comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 is very limited. In this study, the relationship between anxiety and depression levels and inflammation response of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in the hospital was examined. METHODS: 175 patients were included in the study. Sociodemographic Data Form, Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory were applied to the patients. To evaluate the inflammation responses, blood sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, ferritin, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and IL-6 levels were examined. RESULTS: In our study, no relationship was found between anxiety and depression levels and inflammatory responses in patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Anxiety and depression levels of women were higher than men, and NLR, ferritin, IL-6 levels were found to be lower than men. Anxiety levels increase with age. There is a positive correlation between NLR and ferritin levels and duration of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Our study examining the relationship of psychiatric comorbidities with the inflammation response and our increasing literature knowledge, together with studies evaluating the mental effects of COVID-19, suggest that determining the relationship between inflammation responses and psychiatric comorbidities in COVID-19, whose pathophysiology has not been clarified yet, maybe an essential step in interventions on the course of the disease.","Kahve, Aybeniz Civan; Kaya, Hasan; Okuyucu, Merve; Goka, Erol; Barun, Sureyya; Hacimusalar, Yunus",,,530

It is essential to assess the psychological distress experienced by healthcare trainees during the COVID-19 outbreak. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study with 4184 healthcare trainees at Sichuan University in China was implemented during 7-13 February 2020. Participants were grouped by training programmes (medicine, medical technology and nursing) and training stages (undergraduate, postgraduate and residency). MAIN OUTCOMES: COVID-19-related psychological distress and acute stress reaction (ASR) were assessed using the Kessler 6-item Psychological Distress Scale and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, respectively. We estimated the ORs of distress by comparing trainees across programmes and training stages using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Significant psychological distress was found in 1150 (30.90%) participants and probable ASR in 403 (10.74%). Compared with the nursing trainees, the medical trainees (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.95) reported a higher burden of psychological distress during the outbreak, while the medical technology trainees (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.62) reported similar symptom scores. Postgraduates (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.08) in medicine had higher levels of distress than their undergraduate counterparts did, whereas the nursing residents (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.71) reported a lower burden than did nursing undergraduates. A positive association was found between having active clinical duties during the outbreak and distress (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.39), particularly among the medical trainees (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.33) and undergraduates (OR 4.20, 95% CI 1.61 to 11.70). No clear risk patterns of ASR symptoms were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Medical trainees, particularly postgraduates and those with active clinical duties, were at risk for psychological distress during the COVID-19 outbreak. Stress management may be considered for high-risk healthcare trainees.","Wang, Yue; Li, Yuchen; Jiang, Jingwen; Feng, Yuying; Lu, Donghao; Zhang, Wei; Song, Huan",BMJ Open,,530

249741,Facing COVID-19: Psychological Impacts on Hospital Staff in a Tertiary Care Private Hospital in India,2021,"INTRODUCTION: A December 2019 WHO rapid communication recommended the use of 9-month all-oral regimens for treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Besides the clinical benefits, they are thought to be less costly than the injectable-containing regimens, for both the patient and the health system. STREAM is the first randomised controlled trial with an economical evaluation to compare all-oral and injectable-containing 9-11-month MDR-TB treatment regimens. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Health system costs of delivering a 9-month injectable-containing regimen and a 9-month all-oral bedaquiline-containing regimen will be collected in Ethiopia, India, Moldova and Uganda, using 'bottom-up' and 'top-down' costing approaches. Patient costs will be collected using questionnaires that have been developed based on the STOP-TB questionnaire. The primary objective of the study is to estimate the cost utility of the two regimens, from a health system perspective. Secondary objectives include estimating the cost utility from a societal perspective as well as evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the regimens, using both health system and societal perspectives. The effect measure for the cost-utility analysis will be the quality-adjusted life years (QALY), while the effect measure for the cost-effectiveness analysis will be the efficacy outcome from the clinical trial. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been evaluated and approved by the Ethics Advisory Group of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and also approved by ethics committees in all participating countries. All participants have provided written informed consent. The results of the economic evaluation will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Although not crowded in a confined space like a bus or a metro car, bike sharing users will be exposed to the bike surface and take the transmission risk. During the COVID-19 pandemic, how to meet user demand and avoid virus spreading has become an important issue for bike sharing. Based on the trip data of bike sharing in Nanjing, China, this study analyzes the travel demand and operation management before and after the pandemic outbreak from the perspective of stations, users, and bikes. Semi-logarithmic difference-in-differences model, visualization methods, and statistic indexes are applied to explore the transportation service and risk prevention of bike sharing during the pandemic. The results show that pandemic control strategies sharply reduced user demand, and commuting trips decreased more significantly. Some stations around health and religious places become more important. Men and older adults are more dependent on bike sharing systems. Besides, the trip decrease reduces user contact and increases idle bikes. And a new concept of user distancing is proposed to avoid transmission risk and activate idle bikes. This study evaluates the role of shared micro-mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic, and also inspires the blocking of viral transmission within the city.","Hua, Mingzhuang; Chen, Xuewu; Cheng, Long; Chen, Jingxu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02946v1.pdf,530

261513,Pressure injury related to the use of personal protective equipment in COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Despite a plethora of research into Aboriginal employment and recruitment, the extent and nature of the retention of frontline Aboriginal people in health, ageing, and disability workforces are currently unknown. In this application, frontline service delivery is defined as Aboriginal people who are paid employees in the health, ageing, and disability service sectors in roles that involve direct client, participant, or patient contact. There is a need to identify the factors that inhibit (push) and promote (pull) staff retention or departure of this workforce from the sectors. This study will provide additional insight about this topic. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project is to uncover the factors that influence the retention of frontline Aboriginal workers in the health, ageing, and disability workforces in New South Wales (NSW) who do not have university qualifications. The aim of the proposed project aims to discover the push and pull factors for the retention of the frontline Aboriginal workforce in the health, ageing, and disability sectors in NSW in relation to their role, employment, and community and design evidence-based strategies for retaining the Aboriginal frontline workforce in the health, ageing, and disability sectors in NSW. METHODS: The proposed research will use a mixed methods approach, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data via surveys and interviews to capture and represent the voices and perspectives of Aboriginal people in a way that the participants chose. RESULTS: Indigenous research methodologies are a growing field in Aboriginal health research in Australia. A key strength of this study is that it is led by Aboriginal scholars and Aboriginal controlled organizations that apply an Indigenous methodological framework throughout the research process. CONCLUSIONS: This study uses a mixed methods design. The survey and interview questions and model were developed in partnership with Aboriginal health, ageing, and disability service workers rather than relying only on research publications on the workforce, government policies, and human resources strategies. This design places a strong emphasis on generalizable findings together with an inductive approach that explores employers and workers' lived experience of the Aboriginal health workforce in NSW. Excluding workers who have graduated from university places a strong focus on the workforce who have obtained either school or Technical and Further Education or registered training organizations qualifications. Data collection was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and results will include the unique experiences of Aboriginal workers and employers delivering services in an extremely challenging organizational, community, and personal context.

Under this scenario, the combination of two HIV-1 protease inhibitors, lopinavir and ritonavir, has attracted attention since they have been previously employed against the SARS-CoV main proteinase (Mpro) and exhibited some signs of effectiveness. Recently, the 3D structure of SARS-CoV2 Mpro was constructed based on the monomeric SARS-CoV Mpro and employed to identify potential approved small inhibitors against SARS-CoV2 Mpro, allowing the selection of 15 drugs among 1903 approved drugs to be employed. In this study, we performed docking of these 15 approved drugs against the recently solved X-ray crystallography structure of SARS-CoV2 Mpro in the monomeric and dimeric states; the latter is the functional state that was determined in a biological context, and these were submitted to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) approach to obtain insight into the inhibitory activity of these compounds. Similar studies were performed with lopinavir and ritonavir coupled to monomeric and dimeric SARS-CoV Mpro and SARS-CoV2 Mpro to compare the inhibitory differences. Our study provides the structural and energetic basis of the inhibitory properties of lopinavir and ritonavir on SARS-CoV Mpro and SARS-CoV2 Mpro, allowing us to identify two FDA-approved drugs that can be used against SARS-CoV2 Mpro. This study also demonstrated that drug discovery requires the dimeric state to obtain good results.","Bello, Martiniano",J Mol Graph Model,,530

268069,A Double Triage and Telemedicine Protocol to Optimize Infection Control in an Emergency Department in Taiwan During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Feasibility Study,2020,"Introduction: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks are often the result of trauma or recent surgical procedures;however, a subset can develop from non-traumatic etiologies. Cerebrospinal fluid leaks from congenital and spontaneous encephaloceles can be clinically occult and have devastating consequences if undetected for prolonged periods of time. This report highlights a unique case of meningitis after CSF leak caused by ruptured congenital meningocele during a routine nasopharyngeal swab. Case Report: A 54-year-old female with diagnosed CSF leak presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute onset of severe headache, and neck and back pain. Prior to this presentation, the patient had experienced two months of persistent headache and rhinorrhea since her coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) nasopharyngeal swab. As part of her outpatient workup, an otolaryngology consultation with subsequent beta-2 transferrin testing and magnetic resonance imaging was performed and she was diagnosed with a CSF leak from ruptured congenital meningocele. On ED presentation, she was afebrile, but with mild tachycardia, leukocytosis, and meningismus. Lumbar puncture revealed acute streptococcal meningitis. This patient’s meningitis developed due to prolonged occult CSF leak after her COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab ruptured a pre-existing congenital meningocele. Conclusion: Nasopharyngeal swabs are being performed much more frequently due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All front-line providers should be aware of the potential presence and rupture of congenital meningoceles in patients who have undergone recent nasopharyngeal swab when risk-stratifying for potential CSF leak and meningitis.","Holmes, Alexandria Allen Bryant",Clinical Practice and Cases in Emergency Medicine,,530

Public access to the records of their government is thus inhibited by the long backlogs of material awaiting such reviews. This paper studies one aspect of that problem by first creating a new public test collection with annotations for one class of exempt material, the deliberative process privilege, and then by using that test collection to study the ability of current text classification techniques to identify those materials that are exempt from release under that privilege. Results show that when the system is trained and evaluated using annotations from the same reviewer that even difficult cases can often be reliably detected, but that differences in reviewer interpretations, differences in record custodians, and that differences in topics of the records used for training and testing pose additional challenges.","Baron, Jason R.; Sayed, Mahmoud F.; Oard, Douglas W.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07203v1.pdf,530

Limited data has been available in pediatric adrenal insufficiency with Covid-19 Methods: We used TriNetX, with a large COVID-19 database, collecting real-time electronic medical records data. We compared children (0-18 years) who were diagnosed with Covid-19 with and without Adrenal insufficiency. This database collected information from 54 health care organizations Results: Mortality rate in children with Covid-19 and Adrenal insufficiency was 2.246% (19/846). Mortality rate in children with Covid-19 without adrenal insufficiency was 0.097 % (244/252211). Relative risk of mortality for children with Covid-19 and Adrenal insufficiency was 23.2 with a p value of &amp;lt;0.0001. Endotracheal intubation rate in children with Covid-19 and Adrenal insufficiency was 1.418% (12/846). Endotracheal intubation rate in children with Covid-19 without Adrenal insufficiency was 0.065% (165/252211). Relative risk of endotracheal intubation for children with Covid-19 and Adrenal insufficiency was 21.68 with a p value of &amp;lt;0.0001. Sepsis rate in children with Covid-19 and Adrenal insufficiency was 6.974% (59/846). Sepsis rate in children with Covid-19 without Adrenal insufficiency was 0.274% (691/252211). Relative risk of sepsis for children with Covid-19 and Adrenal insufficiency was 25.45 with a p value of &amp;lt;0.00001. Conclusion: Mortality rate, endotracheal and sepsis showed increased association in children with Adrenal insufficiency and Covid-19 versus children with Covid-19 and no Adrenal insufficiency.

METHODS: We present an overview of the impact and response to COVID-19 through the use of public health statistics and reference to policy documents. We subsequently draw on the results of ongoing geographic and health research to present an overview of the impacts and potential implications of COVID-19. RESULTS: The population of many rural areas and farmers in particular are highly vulnerable to adverse outcomes to COVID-19 infection. Single person farm households are at particular risk of isolation, whilst those families with children are at increased risk of stress. CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to address both COVID-19 challenges and the health and wellbeing issues confronting farmers and farm families arising out of the current pandemic by supporting these populations adopt and sustain health behaviour changes, improve their wellbeing and develop the resources that support resilience.","Meredith, David; McNamara, John; van Doorn, Diana; Richardson, Noel",J Agromedicine,,530

Among refereed patient, the incidence of pure hyperbilirubinemia as rare gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms was obvious. METHODS: In this case series, we have reported the clinical data in details for patients with COVID-19 who have been admitted to the Shahid Beheshti Hospital in Qom city, from 3 March to 3 August 2020. COVID infection, be confirmed by using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and chest computed tomography (CT) scan, as well. RESULTS: According to the clinical findings, pure hyperbilirubinemia may consider as rare gastrointestinal (GI) symptom of COVID-19. However, it is possible that the other GI enzymes values fall in to the normal range. CONCLUSION: In some infected patients, GI physicians may face hepatic involvement as pure hyperbilirubinemia. At the age of COVID-19 crisis, all GI physicians should be aware of the possible occurrence of hepatic involvement as an important prognosis of COVID pneumonia and it should be exactly addressed in new referred patients to GI clinic.","Hormati, Ahmad; Ghadir, Mohammad Reza; Saeidi, Mohammad; Aminnejad, Reza; Afifian, Mahboubeh; Ahmadpour, Sajjad",Infectious disorders.

Recent moves toward utilizing blended options to support face-to-face classes with online materials are beneficial, but using solely online classes may not produce similar learning gains. During 2020, the global pandemic meant a loss of face-to-face teaching, such that laboratory classes were rapidly transitioned to online delivery. This study explores the impact of this shift on undergraduate students, evaluating their use of the online laboratory classes and the impact this had on their examination performance and their perceptions of learning. Student use of the online laboratory classes varied, with those spending more time performing better on examinations. Students valued the online classes, finding them helpful for their learning, but also felt that the lack of face-to-face laboratory classes and interactions with peers and teaching staff was detrimental to their learning experience. Overall, academic performance of online learners was comparable to previous years but may indicate some underlying deficits.","Colthorpe, Kay; Ainscough, Louise",Adv Physiol Educ,,530

Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 risk factors, namely: hypertension, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as rheumatic heart disease, compromised immunity and obesity, low case fatality rates have been recorded in many parts of Africa so far. COVID-19 severity has previously been shown to be worse in patients with CVD and hypertension. We observed the severity of COVID-19 and mortality rates in Africa, and compared outcomes with prevalence of established risk factors (hypertension and CVD). We stratified data as per the United Nations' 5 African subregions. North African countries show a positive association between the risk factors and the mortality rates from COVID-19. However, we observed discordant patterns in the relationship between COVID-19, and either CVD or hypertension, in sub-Saharan African countries. In this paper, we also review the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and how it worsens CVD and postulate that the differences in modulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) axis which controls angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)/ACE2 balance may be an important determinant of COVID-19 outcomes in Africa.","Chakafana, Graham; Mutithu, Daniel; Hoevelmann, Julian; Ntusi, Ntobeko; Sliwa, Karen",Clin Res Cardiol,,530

While so, how the immune response progress along the period of viral RNA-shedding (VRS), which determines the infectiousness of disease, is yet to be elucidated. We aim to exhaustively evaluate the peripheral immune cells to expose the interplay of the immune system in uncomplicated COVID-19 cases with different VRS periods and dynamic changes of the immune cell profile in the prolonged cases. We prospectively recruited four uncomplicated COVID-19 patients and four healthy controls (HCs) and evaluated the immune cell profile throughout the disease course. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected and submitted to a multi-panel flowcytometric assay. CD19+-B cells were upregulated, while CD4, CD8, and NK cells were downregulated in prolonged VRS patients. Additionally, the pro-inflammatory-Th1 population showed downregulation, followed by improvement along the disease course, while the immunoregulatory cells showed upregulation with subsequent decline. COVID-19 patients with longer VRS expressed an immune profile comparable to those with severe disease, although they remained clinically stable. Further studies of immune signature in a larger cohort are warranted.","Putri, Denise Utami; Wang, Cheng-Hui; Tseng, Po-Chun; Lee, Wen-Sen; Chen, Fu-Lun; Kuo, Han-Pin; Lee, Chih-Hsin; Lin, Chiou-Feng",Viruses,,530

Some parents may object to mandatory vaccination policies, claiming exemptions based on medical, religious, or philosophical reasons. Individual schools, school systems, or local or regional governments have different policies with respect to whether, and what kind of, exemptions may be allowed. In the setting of the current pandemic, questions regarding the acceptability of exemptions have resurfaced, as schools and local governments struggle with how to safely return children to school. Anticipating that school attendance will be facilitated by the development of a vaccine, school systems will face decisions about whether to mandate vaccination and whether to permit exemptions. The American Academy of Pediatrics promulgates policy favoring the elimination of nonmedical exemptions generally in schools. This discussion considers whether schools should eliminate nonmedical exemptions to vaccination as proposed in the American Academy of Pediatrics policy, ultimately concluding that broad elimination of exemptions is not justified and advocating a more nuanced approach that encourages school attendance while promoting vaccination and broader public health goals.","Paquette, Erin Talati",J Pediatr,,530

We analyze how media and political elites shaped public opinion of the two outbreaks. We conducted a retrospective analysis of media coverage, Congressional floor speech, and public opinion polls to explain elite cueing and public perceptions of Ebola and Zika. We find evidence of elite cueing by Congress and the media on public opinion. Public opinion of both disease outbreaks initially followed partisan patterns. However, while Ebola public opinion remained partisan, ultimately, opinion emerged of a bipartisan nature for Zika, mirroring elite framing. Public health officials should be aware of how elite cueing shapes policy and prioritizes partisan strategies. Politics and public opinion can focus attention on or away from infectious disease; it can also undermine public health responses by biasing the public's view of a diseases' relative risk.","Singer, Phillip M; Willison, Charley E; Greer, Scott L",J. public health policy,,530

The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of various treatment regimens for acute viral rhinosinusitis in children. We compared the treatment effectiveness of acute viral rhinosinusitis using the herbal medicine Sinupret in the form of oral drops, standard treatment and standard treatment supplemented with topical antibacterial drugs. The objectivity of treatment effectiveness evaluation was based on the complaints' dynamics, the changes' presence in the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity within 10 days: at the initial visit, after 3 days, on the 7th and 10th days after the initial examination. A follow-up visit was also scheduled for the 14th day. The analysis of the obtained data revealed that the Sinupret usage in the complex treatment of children with viral etiology acute rhinosinusitis contributes to a more pronounced positive symptoms' dynamics compared to children who did not receive Sinupret. Sinupret eliminates mucostasis, which contributes to a faster restoration of the drainage and ventilation function of the auditory tube, restores mucociliary clearance, improves the condition and well-being of children, improves the effectiveness of therapy and shortens the treatment time.","Sen039,; kevich, O A; Sidorenko, S V; Ditrikh, O A",Vestn Otorinolaringol,,530

330832,Emergency and essential surgical healthcare services during COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries: A perspective,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is diagnosed via detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR). Performance of many SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR assays is not entirely known due to the lack of a gold standard. We sought to evaluate the false negative rate (FNR) and sensitivity of our laboratory-developed SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR targeting the envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) genes. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR results at the Public Health Laboratory (Alberta, Canada) from January 21 to April 18, 2020 were reviewed to identify patients with an initial negative rtRT-PCR followed by a positive result on repeat testing within 14 days (defined as discordant results). Negative samples from these discordant specimens were re-tested using three alternate rtRT-PCR assays (targeting the E gene and N1/N2 regions of the nucleocapsid genes) to assess for false negative (FN) results. RESULTS: During the time period specified, 95,919 patients (100,001 samples) were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 49 patients were found to have discordant results including 49 positive and 52 negative swabs. Repeat testing of 52 negative swabs found five FNs (from five separate patients). Assuming 100% specificity of the diagnostic assay, the FNR and sensitivity in this group of patients with discordant testing was 9.3% (95% CI 1.5-17.0%) and 90.7% (95% CI 82.6-98.9%) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Studies to understand the FNR of routinely used assays are important to confirm adequate clinical performance. In this study, most FN results were due to low amounts of SARS-CoV-2 virus concentrations in patients with multiple specimens collected during different stages of infection. Post-test clinical evaluation of each patient is advised to ensure that rtRT-PCR results are not the only factor in excluding COVID-19.","Kanji, Jamil N; Zelyas, Nathan; MacDonald, Clayton; Pabbaraju, Kanti; Khan, Muhammad Naeem; Prasad, Abhaya; Hu, Jia; Diggle, Mathew; Berenger, Byron M; Tipples, Graham",Virol J,,530

The RECOVERY (Randomised Trials in COVID-19 Therapy) trial provided data on the mortality benefits of corticosteroids. The study aimed to determine the association between corticosteroid use on mortality and infection rates and to define subgroups who may benefit from corticosteroids in a real-world setting. METHODS: Clinical data were extracted that included demographic, laboratory data and details of the therapy, including the administration of corticosteroids, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab and anticoagulation. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) admission and invasive mechanical ventilation. Outcomes were compared in patients who did and did not receive corticosteroids using the multivariate Cox regression model. RESULTS: 4313 patients were hospitalised with COVID-19 during the study period, of whom 1270 died (29.4%). When administered within the first 7 days after admission, corticosteroids were associated with reduced mortality (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.97, p=0.03) and decreased transfers to the ICU (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.11, p=0.02). This mortality benefit was particularly impressive in younger patients (<65 years of age), females and those with elevated inflammatory markers, defined as C reactive protein &#8805;150 mg/L (p&#8804;0.05), interleukin-6 &#8805;20 pg/mL (p&#8804;0.05) or D-dimer &#8805;2.0 µg/L (p&#8804;0.05). Therapy was safe with similar rates of bacteraemia and fungaemia in corticosteroid-treated and non-corticosteroid-treated patients.

The model provides precious information on the tight relationship between the variation of the reported infection cases and a well defined observable physical quantity: the average number of people that lie within the daily displacement area of any single person. The extension of the model now includes self-consistent evaluation of the reproduction index, effect of immunization due to vaccination, and potential impact of virus variants on the dynamical evolution of the outbreak. The model fits very well the epidemic data, and allows us to strictly relate the time evolution of the number of hospitalized case and fatalities to the change of people mobility, vaccination rate, and appearance of an initial concentration of people positives for new variants of the virus.","Spinella, Corrado; Mio, Antonio Massimiliano",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02759v2.pdf,530

We sought to shed further light on this issue by conducting a single-center study in a kidney transplant center located in one of the France's highest risk zone (Grand Est) for Covid-19 during the initial disease outbreak. METHOD: To this aim, we used a survey approach coupled with systematic investigation of SARS-CoV-2 serology in a cohort of 1390 KTR. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 serologies were available for 780 survey respondents, among whom 48 had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (total seroprevalence: 6.2%). Thirty-five of the 48 seropositive KTR had previously received a diagnosis of Covid-19, whereas the remaining 13 patients were not known to be infected (8 asymptomatic cases). Specifically, 18.7% of seropositive KTR and 1.1% of the entire cohort were asymptomatic. Household exposure was found to markedly increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that the overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in KTR living in one of the France's highest risk zone for Covid-19 during the first French lockdown was as low as 6.3%.

Reactive movements in response to a loss of balance are altered in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and are critical for fall prevention. Further, falls are more common while attention is divided. Although divided attention has been shown to impact postural responses in healthy older adults, the impact of dividing attention on reactive balance, and the natural prioritization across postural and cognitive tasks in people with PD is largely unknown. Objectives. To characterize (1) the impact of a secondary cognitive task on reactive postural control and (2) the prioritization across stepping and cognitive tasks in people with PD. Methods. Sixteen people with PD and 14 age-matched controls underwent step-inducing, support-surface perturbations from stance, with and without an auditory Stroop secondary cognitive task. Cognitive, neuromuscular, and protective stepping performance were calculated for single and dual task scenarios. Results. In PD and control participants, cognitive reaction times (P = .001) and muscle onset latency (P = .007), but not protective step outcomes (P > .12 for all) were worse during dual tasking compared with single-task scenarios. Both PD and control groups prioritized the protective stepping task over the cognitive task. Overall, people with PD exhibited worse first-step margin of stability (a measure of protective step performance) than controls (P = .044). Conclusion. This study provides preliminary evidence that people with PD, like age-matched controls, exhibit cognitive and neuromuscular, but not protective step, dual-task interference. The lack of dual-task interference on step performance indicates a postural prioritization for PD and healthy older adults during dual-task protective stepping.","Peterson, Daniel S; Barajas, Jordan S; Denney, Linda; Mehta, Shyamal H",Neurorehabil Neural Repair,,530

Similarly a recall response to SARS-CoV-2 antigen involving the T cell compartment can be readily demonstrated in recovered individuals but is of variable magnitude.","Carter, Clive; Hughes, Pamela; McHugh, Anna; Nadat, Fatima; Lewthwaite, Penny; Savic, Sinisa; Clark, Brendan",J Immunol Methods,,530

360505,Dental trauma during COVID,2021,"BACKGROUND: Regional variation in lung transplantation practices due to local coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevalence may cause geographic disparities in access to lung transplantation. METHODS: Using the United Network for Organ Sharing registry, we conducted a descriptive analysis of lung transplant volume, donor lung volume, new waitlist activations, and waiting list deaths at high-volume lung transplant centers during the first 3 months of the pandemic (March 1. 2020, to May 30, 2020) and we compared it to the same period in the preceding 5 years. RESULTS: Lung transplant volume decreased by 10% nationally and by a median of 50% in high COVID-19 prevalence centers (range -87% to 80%) compared with a median increase of 10% (range -87% to 80%) in low prevalence centers (P-for-trend 0.006). Donation services areas with high COVID-19 prevalence experienced a greater decrease in organ availability (-28% range, -72% to -11%) compared with low prevalence areas (+7%, range -20% to + 55%, P-for-trend 0.001). Waiting list activations decreased at 18 of 22 centers. Waiting list deaths were similar to the preceding 5 years and independent of local COVID-19 prevalence (P-for-trend 0.36).

376172,Skin Reactions to Personal Protective Equipment among First-Line COVID-19 Healthcare Workers: A Survey in Northern Morocco,2021,"The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) continues to drastically affect healthcare throughout the world. To date, no approved treatment regimen or vaccine is available to effectively attenuate or prevent the infection. Therefore, collective and multidisciplinary efforts are needed to identify new therapeutics or to explore effectiveness of existing drugs and drug-like small molecules against SARS-CoV-2 for lead identification and repurposing prospects. This study addresses the identification of small molecules that specifically bind to any of the three essential proteins (RdRp, 3CL-protease and helicase) of SARS-CoV-2. By applying computational approaches we screened a library of 4574 compounds also containing FDA-approved drugs against these viral proteins. Shortlisted hits from initial screening were subjected to iterative docking with the respective proteins. Ranking score on the basis of binding energy, clustering score, shape complementarity and functional significance of the binding pocket was applied to identify the binding compounds. Finally, to minimize chances of false positives, we performed docking of the identified molecules with 100 irrelevant proteins of diverse classes thereby ruling out the non-specific binding. Three FDA-approved drugs showed binding to 3CL-protease either at the catalytic pocket or at an allosteric site related to functionally important dimer formation. A drug-like molecule showed binding to RdRp in its catalytic pocket blocking the key catalytic residues. Two other drug-like molecules showed specific interactions with helicase at a key domain involved in catalysis. This study provides lead drugs or drug-like molecules for further in vitro and clinical investigation for drug repurposing and new drug development prospects.","Iftikhar, Hafsa; Ali, Hafiza Nayyer; Farooq, Sadia; Naveed, Hammad; Shahzad-Ul-Hussan, Syed",Comput Biol Med,,530

To correlate interleukin-6 levels in COVID-19 patients with olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions and to investigate the role of IL-6 in the onset of these disorders, this observational study investigated 67 COVID-19 patients with taste or smell disorders or both, who did not require intensive care admission, admitted at COVID Hospital of Policlinico of Bari from March to May 2020. Interleukin-6 was assayed in COVID-19 patients with taste or smell disturbances at the time of admission and at the time of swab negativization. At the same time, patients have been given a specific survey to evaluate the severity of taste and smell disturbances. Of 125 patients with smell or taste dysfunctions at onset of disease, 67 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, while 58 were excluded because 35 of them required intensive care admission, 5 were unable to answer, 5 died, 7 had finished chemotherapy recently, and 5 refused to participate. The evaluation of taste and smell disorders was carried out using a survey performed at the time of admission and at the time of swab negativization. Sinonasal outcome test 22 (SNOT-22) was used as a reference for olfactory function assessment, and Taste and Smell Questionnaire Section of the US NHANES 2011-2014 protocol (CDC 2013b) was used as reference for gustatory function assessment. A venous blood sample was taken for each patient to measure IL-6 levels upon entry and at swab negativization. Interleukin-6 levels in COVID-19 patients in relation to olfactory or gustatory disorders were correlated from the time of their admission to the time of swab negativization. Statistically significant correlations were obtained between the decrease of interleukin-6 levels and the improvement of smell (p value < 0.05) and taste (p = 0.047) functions at swab negativization. The acquired results demonstrate the key role of interleukin-6 in the pathogenesis of chemosensitive disorders in COVID-19 patients.","Cazzolla, Angela P; Lovero, Roberto; Lo Muzio, Lorenzo; Testa, Nunzio F; Schirinzi, Annalisa; Palmieri, Giuseppe; Pozzessere, Pietro; Procacci, Vito; Di Comite, Mariasevera; Ciavarella, Domenico; Pepe, Maria; De Ruvo, Caterina; Crincoli, Vito; Di Serio, Francesca; Santacroce, Luigi",ACS Chem Neurosci,,530

This study aimed to evaluate the ability of co-administration of the probiotics L. rhamnosus GG ATCC53103 and L. plantarum JL01 to stimulate immune responses and improve gut health during the critical weaning period in piglets. Forty-eight weaned piglets were randomly divided into four groups, and fed daily for 28 days either without, or with the two probiotics independently, or in combination. On day 28, we analyzed the cytokine and bacterial changes in intestinal mucosa and the hepatic portal vein blood metabolites of the weaned piglets. Our results showed that combined L. rhamnosus GG ATCC53103 and L. plantarum JL01 significantly increased (p < 0.05) the growth performance and expression of IL-10 and TGF-ß1 mRNAs. In contrast, this treatment significantly decreased (p < 0.05) IL-1ß mRNA level in the jejunum, ileum, and cecum. Furthermore, the secretion of IL-6 in the cecum, IL-1ß in the jejunum, ileum, and cecum, and TNF-&#945; in the jejunum and ileum was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of Prevotella_9 and Enterococcus in ileum and cecum was significantly increased (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of Ruminococcus_1 and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 in cecum was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). Prevotella_9 and Enterococcus may increase the accumulation of (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TCDA) in portal vein blood, while Ruminococcus_1 and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 may decrease the accumulation of succinic and palmitic acids. These results indicate that L. rhamnosus GG ATCC53103 and L. plantarum JL01 may regulate cytokine levels by reducing the accumulation of succinic and palmitic acids and increasing the accumulation of TCDA and DHA, thereby enhancing the immunity of weaned piglets.","Geng, Tingting; He, Feng; Su, Shuai; Sun, Kecheng; Zhao, Lei; Zhao, Yuan; Bao, Nan; Pan, Li; Sun, Hui",Res Vet Sci,,530

Would nature images (such as a leaf or flower) on the label have the same effect? This paper aims to examine the role of these labeling strategies in influencing consumer willing to pay.Design/methodology/approachUsing a 2 × 3 experiment, the authors empirically test the research questions across two studies: in the controlled-lab setting with 160 students (Study 1) and in a field-setting with 268 consumers shopping at a grocery store (Study 2).FindingsResults are consistent across both studies. Surprisingly, participants are willing to pay more for the product when it has a white-toned label rather than a green-toned one. Follow-up path analysis, with Study 2 data, reveals that a white-toned label has both an indirect (through more favorable evaluations of the product’s environmental friendliness), as well as a direct impact on willingness to pay. In providing a post hoc explanation, it is argued that a white-toned label better directs attention towards the claim signaling the product’s eco-friendliness, while providing a “clean”, “high-quality” look. In both studies however, nature images on the label did not have a significant effect.Practical implicationsInsights are particularly interesting for practitioners seeking to better label/package green products.Originality/valueThis investigation is the first to empirically examine how color and images on the label influence the dollar amount consumers are willing to pay for a green product. Findings reveal that counter to common belief, the heavy use of the color green on eco-friendly product labels might not be appropriate;a predominantly white-toned label works better.","Samaraweera, Manoshi Sims Jeanetta D.; Homsey, Dini M.",The Journal of Consumer Marketing,,530
386385,Rapid Implementation and Innovative Applications of a Virtual Intensive Care Unit During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Case Study,2020,"RATIONALE: Chest computed tomography (CT) has a potential role in the diagnosis, detection of complications, and prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The value of chest CT can be further amplified when associated to physiological variables. Some studies have done efforts to correlate chest CT findings with overall oxygenation and respiratory mechanics, which although they are easily obtained may not be specifically related to COVID-19. Very few studies have tried to correlate chest CT findings with specific biomarkers related to COVID-19. For this purpose, temporal changes of chest CT were evaluated and then correlated with laboratory data in multicenter randomized clinical trial. METHODS: Adult patients who presented chest CT scan features compatible with viral pneumonia were admitted in the hospital and followed during 7 days (NCT: 04561219). CT scans and laboratory data [D-dimer, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] in blood were obtained at the moment of admission (Baseline) and on day 7 (Final). Qualitative and quantitative chest CT scan parameters were evaluated in ventral, middle and dorsal regions of interest (ROI) and classified as: hyper-, normal-, poor-, and non-aerated. RESULTS: In this study involving 45 COVID-19 patients no statistically significant differences in the overall Hounsfield Units (HU) ranges and percent of whole lung mass were found overtime. Normally aerated lung tissue reduced from Baseline to Final (p=0.004), mainly associated with a decrease in ventral (p=0.001) and middle (p=0.026) ROIs. At dorsal ROI, a reduction in CT lung mass in poorly aerated areas was observed from Baseline to Final. Poorly aerated and non-aerated lung areas were well correlated only with D-dimer blood levels (r=0.55, p&lt;0.001;and r=0.52, p=0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, changes in poor-and non-aerated were associated to changes in D-dimer blood levels, which may be a specific biomarker to be follow in facilities without CT as a way to infer radiologic changes.","Silva, P.

388980,Mortality data of Covid-19 remain illusive and inconsistent,2020,"In the attempt to counter the second COVID-19 wave in autumn 2020, the Italian government introduced a unique countrywide system of physical distancing measures organized in progressively restrictive tiers (coded as yellow, orange, and red) imposed on a regional basis according to epidemiological risk assessments. This followed a set of other scattered or limited measures described in full detail by Manica et al.1. This paper concerns the introduction of the tiered restrictions. The data used to evaluate the impact of the restriction system on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and hospitalization burden in Italy is from the Italian COVID-19 integrated surveillance system. The reproduction number R(t) estimated on the onset of COViD-19 symptoms constantly decreased during most of the observation period 04 October 2020 - 06 December 2020 than is centered on the date of introduction of the measures and includes the expected latency to reach an effect. The fastest decrease of R(t) occurred in the period preceding the introduction of the tiered restrictions. There was no evidence that introducing the tiered restrictions determined the reduction of R(t). An alternative analysis using the daily growth rate of the epidemic curve confirms these conclusions. Similar considerations are made concerning the health system burden, analyzing hospitalizations at country level. The trend of R(t) tending to increase shortly after the measures became effective does not allow to exclude that the enforcement of such restrictions might have been counterproductive. These results are instrumental in informing public health efforts aimed at attempting to manage the epidemic efficiently. Planning further use of the tiered restrictions and the associated containment measures should be carefully and critically revised to avoid a useless burden to the population with no advantage for the containment of the epidemic or a possible worsening.","Rainisio, Maurizio",,,530

The population-normalized values of deaths, diagnostic tests, confirmed cases, and doses of vaccines administered were considered. The average infection-fatality-rate provides us a baseline on potential deaths, and along with the test-positivity-rates in the formula, they add robustness to the estimates of the quality of response. The scores are used to rank countries in two lists representing 84 large countries with a population greater than 10 million, and 85 countries with smaller populations. Additional possible corrections in the rankings of countries to include the per capita purchasing power and the age distribution, are also shown. A few significant inferences are pondered that may help unravel the causes of the poor outcomes. In the last part of the manuscript, it is shown that the presented rankings are robust to the expected uncertainties in the data.","Venkatapathi, Thilakam; Venkatapathi, Murugesan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.15055v2.pdf,530

In this study, our goal was to explore the changing expression levels of acute-phase reaction proteins (APRPs) in the serum of COVID-19 patients and to elucidate the immunological characteristics of COVID-19. In the study design, we recruited 72 COVID-19 patients, including 22 cases of mild degree, 38 cases of moderate degree and 12 cases of severe degree. We also recruited 20 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and 20 normal control subjects as a comparison. Fasting venous blood was taken to detect the content of complement 3 (C3), complement 4 (C4), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA) and prealbumin (PA). When compared the COVID-19 group with the CAP and normal control groups, respectively, the mean value of CRP and SAA in the COVID-19 group (including mild, moderate and severe patients) had increased significantly (P < 0.01), whereas the mean values of C3, C4 and PA decreased (P < 0.01). For the asymptomatic or mild symptomatic patients with COVID-19, the actual aggravation of disease may be more advanced than the clinical appearances. Meanwhile, the statistical analyses indicated that the development of COVID-19 brought about a significant increase in the content of CRP and SAA (P < 0.01), and a decline in the content of C3, C4 and PA (P < 0.01). These findings suggested that the changes in the level of APRPs could be used as indicators to identify the degree and progression of COVID-19, and the significant changes might demonstrate the aggravation of disease.

Potential neurological manifestations and their pathophysiological mechanisms have not been thoroughly established. In this narrative review, we sought to present the neurological manifestations associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Case reports, case series, editorials, reviews, case-control and cohort studies were evaluated, and relevant information was abstracted. Various reports of neurological manifestations of previous coronavirus epidemics provide a roadmap regarding potential neurological complications of COVID-19, due to many shared characteristics between these viruses and SARS-CoV-2. Studies from the current pandemic are accumulating and report COVID-19 patients presenting with dizziness, headache, myalgias, hypogeusia and hyposmia, but also with more serious manifestations including polyneuropathy, myositis, cerebrovascular diseases, encephalitis and encephalopathy. However, discrimination between causal relationship and incidental comorbidity is often difficult. Severe COVID-19 shares common risk factors with cerebrovascular diseases, and it is currently unclear whether the infection per se represents an independent stroke risk factor. Regardless of any direct or indirect neurological manifestations, the COVID-19 pandemic has a huge impact on the management of neurological patients, whether infected or not. In particular, the majority of stroke services worldwide have been negatively influenced in terms of care delivery and fear to access healthcare services. The effect on healthcare quality in the field of other neurological diseases is additionally evaluated.","Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Palaiodimou, Lina; Katsanos, Aristeidis H.; Caso, Valeria; Köhrmann, Martin; Molina, Carlos; Cordonnier, Charlotte; Fischer, Urs; Kelly, Peter; Sharma, Vijay K.; Chan, Amanda C.; Zand, Ramin; Sarraj, Amrou; Schellinger, Peter D.; Voumvourakis, Konstantinos I.; Grigoriadis, Nikolaos; Alexandrov, Andrei V.; Tsiodras, Sotirios",Ther.

Two independent lung protein interactome were constructed to reveal the signaling process on receptor activation and host protein hijacking machinery in the pathogenesis of virus. Further, we test the functional role of the hubs derived from the interactome. Most hubs proteins were differentially regulated on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, the proteins in viral replication hubs were related with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension confirming the vulnerability and severity of infection in the risk individual. Additionally, the hub proteins were closely linked with other viral infection, including MERS and HCoVs which suggest similar infection pattern in SARS-CoV-2. We identified five hubs that interconnect both networks that show the preparation of optimal environment in the host for viral replication process upon receptor attachment. Interestingly, we propose that seven potential miRNAs, targeting the intermediate phase that connects receptor and viral replication process a better choice as a drug for SARS-CoV-2.","Ahmed, Shiek S.

405388,COVID-19 Disease: Perspectives in Low- and Middle-Income Countries,2020,"Despite the ubiquity of the body mass index (BMI) in discourse on health, there is ambiguity in its use as a biomarker of current abnormality versus future risk. This distinction is consequential for knowledge of the relationship between body size and health, as well as for individuals deemed to have abnormal and 'unhealthy' bodies. Consequently, the purposes of this review are threefold. The first is to differentiate this 'biomarker' perspective from extant critiques of BMI as a proxy for health behaviours or as the defining characteristic of obesity as a disease. The second is to highlight the shift towards treating BMI as a measure of attained unhealthiness, rather than a probabilistic indicator of risk. Finally, rather than call for the abolition of BMI, this paper argues that its continued use as 'just a number' is in keeping with the push for weight neutrality in research and practice. The review concludes by demonstrating how the riskiness and unhealthiness of body size is conflated in public health messaging on COVID-19. BMI is a marker of risk, but its use as a surrogate for COVID-19 severity equates body size with health, shaping beliefs about vulnerability and personal responsibility amid an ongoing pandemic.","Gutin, Iliya",Sociol. health illn,,530

Here we describe the clinical characteristics, disease outcome, and risk factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death of a cohort of 53 kidney transplant patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Eight of 53 have been handled as outpatients because of mild disease, on average with immunosuppression reduction and the addition of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin; no patients required admission, developed ARDS, or died. Because of severe symptoms, 45/53 required admission: this cohort has been managed with immunosuppression withdrawal, methylprednisolone 16 mg/d, hydroxychloroquine, and antiviral drugs. Dexamethasone and tocilizumab were considered in case of ARDS. About 33% of the patients developed acute kidney injury, 60% ARDS, and 33% died. In this group, thrombocytopenia was associated to ARDS whereas lymphopenia at the baseline, higher D-dimer, and lack of C-reactive protein reduction were associated with risk of death. In the overall population, dyspnea was associated with the risk of ARDS and age older than 60 years and dyspnea were associated with the risk of death with only a trend toward an increased risk of death for patients on tacrolimus. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection may have a variable outcome in renal transplant patients, with higher risk of ARDS and death in the ones requiring admission.","Bossini, Nicola; Alberici, Federico; Delbarba, Elisa; Valerio, Francesca; Manenti, Chiara; Possenti, Stefano; Econimo, Laura; Maffei, Camilla; Pola, Alessandra; Terlizzi, Vincenzo; Salviani, Chiara; Moscato, Marianna; Pasquali, Stefano; Zambetti, Nicole; Tonoli, Michela; Affatato, Stefania; Pecchini, Paola; Viola, Fabio B; Malberti, Fabio; Depetri, Giorgio; Gaggiotti, Mario; Scolari, Francesco",Am. j. transplant,,530

Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we have demonstrated the allosteric crosstalk within the RBD in the apo- and the ACE2 receptor-bound states, revealing the contribution of the dynamics-based correlated motions and the electrostatic energy perturbations to this crosstalk. While allostery, based on correlated motions, dominates inherent distal communication in the apo-RBD, the electrostatic energy perturbations determine favorable pairwise crosstalk within the RBD residues upon binding to ACE2. Interestingly, the allosteric path is composed of residues which are evolutionarily conserved within closely related coronaviruses, pointing toward the biological relevance of the communication and its potential as a target for drug development.","Bhattacharjee, Sayan; Bhattacharyya, Rajanya; Sengupta, Jayati",FEBS Lett,,530

The development of climate indices to measure the suitability of climate for major tourism market segments has evolved over three decades. This study provides the first application of the holiday climate index (HCI):Beach specification in the Asia-Pacific tourism region. The HCI is designed from international tourist climate preference studies and is compared with the tourism climate index (TCI), which is widely applied, but not based on tourist climate preferences. The index inter-comparison is conducted at 14 of the most popular beach resort destinations in China, which include four geographic regions of China with four different Köppen classifications. The results show key differences between the two indices in rating the climatic suitability of the selected beach destinations in China, with the TCI rating beach destinations in the north and south higher during the spring and fall seasons, which is not consistent with beach tourism visits. During the summer months, southern destinations have much higher HCI:Beach rating, reflecting the 3S tourists' desire for higher temperatures. The findings reinforce those from other tourism regions that indicate the TCI is not appropriate for assessing 3S tourism potential and that additional cross-cultural studies of tourist climate indices are needed to better inform market segment climate service development and to understand the potential impacts of future climate change.","Yu, D D; Rutty, M; Scott, D; Li, S",Int. j. biometeorol,,530

We compare simulations with available experimental data, describe the resulting conformational ensembles, and identify the presence of specific structural rearrangements in apical and internal loops that may be functionally relevant. Our atomic-detailed structural predictions reveal a rich dynamics in these RNA molecules, could help the experimental characterization of these systems, and provide putative three-dimensional models for structure-based drug design studies.","Bottaro, Sandro; Bussi, Giovanni; Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten",J Am Chem Soc,,530

METHODS AND RESULTS: Five critically ill COVID-19 patients with pulmonary hypertension designated Cases 1-5 were retrospectively included. Clinical data before and after iNO treatment were serially collected and compared between patients with or without iNO treatment. The five cases experienced pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) elevation (&#8805;50 mmHg) at 30, 24, 33, 23, and 24 days after illness onset (d.a.o), respectively. Cases 1-3 received iNO treatment on the 24th, 13th, and 1st day after the first elevation of PASP, with concentrations varied from 10 to 20 ppm based on the changes of PASP and blood pressure for 10, 9, and 5 days, respectively. Upon iNO treatment, PASP of Cases 1 and 2 returned to normal on the 10th day and 1st day, and maintained between 50 and 58 mmHg in Case 3. Pa02 /Fi02 increased from 88 to 124, 51 to 118, and 146 to 244, respectively. SPO2 increased from 91% to 97% for Case 1 and maintained a high level above 97% for Case 2. Cardiac function remained normal in the three patients after treatment. Moreover, Cases 1 and 3 survived from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, while Case 2 finally died on the 36th day after the first elevation of PASP due to severe complications. Both cases who did not receive iNO treatment experienced a sudden decrease of PASP and Pa02 /Fi02 due to right heart failure and then died. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled nitric oxide treatment was beneficial in reducing and stabilizing the PASP and might also reduce the risk of right heart failure in COVID-19 with pulmonary hypertension.","Feng, Wen-Xia; Yang, Yang; Wen, Junmin; Liu, Ying-Xia; Liu, Lei; Feng, Cheng",ESC Heart Fail,,530

The candidate antibodies were evaluated further for epitope restriction, interaction energy and interaction surface to gauge their repurposability to tackle SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our work provides candidate antibody scaffolds with dual activities of plausible viral neutralization and immunosuppression. Further, these candidate antibodies can also be explored in diagnostic test kits for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Various traditional practices associated with their processing and consumption are uncommon and unknown to the present generation, resulting to their underutilization. Methods: Qualitative data were obtained through focus group discussions (FGDs), key informant interviews (KIIs), and participant observation. Using a checklist and questionnaire, a total of 120 individuals from 120 randomly selected households in Kilimanjaro and Morogoro regions were interviewed. Results. Underutilised indigenous vegetables from Morogoro and Kilimanjaro regions were investigated. Out of 40 vegetables, four underutilised vegetables (UVs), Sunga (Launea cornuta), Kikundembala (Vigna vexillata), Mokiki (Momordica foetida), and Inyiri (Basella alba), were identified, collected, and studied. Over 75% of respondents preferred UVs to exotic species, the likes of cabbage, amaranth, eggplant, pumpkin leaves, and spinach. It was further noted that with the existing myths and fads associated with consumption of UVs, as well as the widespread use of the exotic vegetable species among the modern generation, UVs' future demand is diminishing. Conclusion: There are many varieties of UVs in Morogoro and Kilimanjaro regions. However, the UVs are currently showing decreasing demand due to various reasons including difficulties in preparation, low palatability, and negative image to consumers; introduction of exotic species of vegetables was found to further suppress the use of UVs.","Chacha, James S; Laswai, Henry S",Int J Food Sci,,530

This disease can cause respiratory distress, fever, and fatigue. It still has no drug and vaccine for treatment and prevention. Therefore, WHO recommends that people should stay at home to reduce disease transmission. Due to the quarantine, FDA stated that this could hamper drug development clinical trial protocols. Hence, an alternative sampling method that can be applied at home is needed. Currently, volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) has become attention in its use in clinical and bioanalytical fields. This paper discusses the advantages and challenges that might be found in the use of VAMS as an alternative sampling tool in clinical trials and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) during the COVID-19 pandemic. VAMS allows easy sampling, can be done at home, storage and delivery at room temperature, and the volume taken is small and minimally invasive. VAMS is also able to absorb a fixed volume that can increase the accuracy and precision of analytical methods, and reduce the hematocrit effects (HCT).

Ambulance services in Australasia use ketamine, droperidol or midazolam as first line agent but the optimal agent is uncertain. In Victoria, intramuscular (IM) ketamine is used. The present study aimed to examine the prehospital characteristics and ED outcomes of patients with severe agitation after IM ketamine administration. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted for patients who received IM ketamine for severe agitation over a 2-year period. Data were sourced from Ambulance Victoria and linked to hospital data. The primary outcome was time to sedation. Data collected included baseline characteristics, adverse events and ED outcomes. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-eight prehospital cases transported to 32 hospitals were included. Outcome data were available for 305 patients (21 hospitals). Median age was 31 years (IQR 23-40). 71.2% were male. Adequate sedation was achieved in 96.9% of cases in a median time of 5.0 min (IQR 3.0-7.0; range 1-31 min). Adverse events were transient hypoxia (5.0%), hyper-salivation (4.2%) and emergence reactions (0.8%). A total of 45 (14.8%) patients were intubated; two prehospital. CONCLUSION: Intramuscular ketamine is effective with a low rate of prehospital complications in severely agitated patients in the prehospital setting. Given the variation in ambulance practice in Australasia, prospective, randomised trials in the prehospital setting comparing ketamine to other sedating agents such as droperidol in patients with severe agitation are required.","Bernard, Stephen; Roggenkamp, Renee; Delorenzo, Ashleigh; Stephenson, Michael; Smith, Karen",Emerg. med Australas,,530

TB is strongly associated with poverty and this risk is largely mediated by undernutrition in India. COVID-19 response related lockdown has resulted in an economic crisis which may double levels of poverty, has exacerbated food insecurity, and disrupted TB services. These developments may have serious implications for TB progression and transmission in India. The nutritional status of a population is a strong determinant of the TB incidence, and undernutrition in adults alone accounts for 32-44% of TB incidence in India. A systematic review has shown that a 14% increase in TB incidence can occur per one unit decrease in body mass index (BMI), across the BMI range of 18.5-30 kg/m2. We believe that one unit decrease in BMI (corresponding to a 2-3 kg weight loss) may result in the poor in India as a result of the lockdown and its aftermath. This may result in an increase in estimated (uncertainty interval) incident TB by 185 610 (180 230, 190 990) cases. A 59% reduction in TB case detection between end March and May 2020, may result in an estimated (uncertainty interval) additional 87 711 (59 998, 120 630) TB deaths [19.5% increase (14.5, 24.7)] in 2020. Disadvantaged social groups and those living in states with higher levels of poverty, under-nutrition,and migrant workers are at particular risk. We suggest enhanced rations including pulses through the public distribution system and direct cash transfers to the poor pending restoration of livelihoods. TB services should be resumed immediately with enhanced efforts at case detection including active case finding. To prevent deaths among TB detected within the national TB programme, systemic identification, referral and management of severe disease at notification should be considered.","Bhargava, Anurag; Shewade, Hemant Deepak",Indian J Tuberc,,530
465670,Can COVID-19 innovations and systems help low- and middle-income countries to re-imagine healthcare delivery?,2021,"Tourism is both a major contributor to climate change and also one of the sectors more heavily impacted. Developing and implementing adaptation and mitigation measures are of particular importance, as the extent of climate risks in the second half of the century can still be significantly influenced by effective global actions. This paper is based on an in-depth report on tourism and climate change for the tourism destination of Austria, summarizing the current scientific knowledge and a related stakeholder discussion. Against this background, the paper at hand discusses possible fields of action, examples of suitable measures, and related challenges. It shows how to distinguish different levels of action and develop related adaptation strategies for the traveler (consumer adaptation), the tourist operation (business adaptation), the regional destination (destination adaptation) and the destination of Austria (national destination policy and adaptation). However, the discussion also shows that current incremental progress may be – despite its many successes – too slow for the challenging task. The experiences around Covid-19 have shown that normative instruments do have the power to affect significant trend reversals, including a change in lifestyle. The wealth of adaptation measures presented in this paper should be incorporated into a vision such as the climate friendly “Paris-Lifestyle” – a tangible change and a common societal task. Management implications The effects of climate change can still be influenced to avoid significant effects in the second half of the century. However, this requires a focus on normative measures on the national and European level. The compilation of methodological approaches shows that, in addition to a strong normative approach, a combination of economic, behavioral economic planning and moderating methods can also be used. In the area of behavioral economics and nudging in particular, the existing options have hardly ever been applied. For managers in tourism businesses, this is where the greatest potential is seen.","Pröbstl-Haider, Ulrike Mostegl Nina Damm Andrea",Journal of Outdoor Recreation and Tourism,,530

468339,Rural Telemedicine Use Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Repeated Cross-sectional Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: High stress prenatally contributes to poor maternal and infant well-being. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created substantial stress for pregnant women. PURPOSE: To understand whether stress experienced by women pregnant at the beginning of the pandemic was associated with a greater prevalence of adverse perinatal outcomes. METHODS: Pregnant women across the USA aged &#8805;18 years old enrolled in a prospective cohort study during the pandemic onset (T1) in April-May 2020. This report focuses on the 1,367 participants who gave birth prior to July-August 2020 (T2). Hierarchical logistic regression models predicted preterm birth, small for gestational age infants, and unplanned operative delivery from T1 stress, sociodemographic, and medical factors. RESULTS: After controlling for sociodemographic and medical factors, preterm birth was predicted by high prenatal maternal stress, delivering an infant small for gestational age was predicted by interpersonal violence and by stress related to being unprepared for birth due to the pandemic, and unplanned cesarean or operative vaginal delivery was predicted by prenatal appointment alterations, experiencing a major stressful life event, and by stress related to being unprepared for birth due to the pandemic. Independent of these associations, African American women were more likely than other groups to deliver preterm. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women who are experiencing high stress during the COVID-19 pandemic are at risk of poorer perinatal outcomes. A longitudinal investigation is critical to determine whether prenatal maternal stress and resulting outcomes have longer-term consequences for the health and well-being of children born in the midst of the current pandemic.","Preis, Heidi; Mahaffey, Brittain; Pati, Susmita; Heiselman, Cassandra; Lobel, Marci",Ann Behav Med,,530

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has wreaked havoc, and Health Authorities have started to make announcements and studies have been started quickly, for effective treatment and vaccination. In studies, drugs that reduce the symptoms of COVID-19 and alleviate the course of the disease have been used. In addition to the effects of these promising drugs, adverse events and multiple drug interactions have begun to appear all over the world, as well as in our country. Therefore, pharmacovigilance is of particular importance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health authorities have been taking additional actions and measures to carry out adverse effects monitoring and risk minimization activities of drugs.

472215,Symptomatic reinfection with COVID-19: A first from Western India,2021,"Positive-strand RNA viruses have been the etiological agents in several major disease outbreaks over the last few decades. Examples of this include flaviviruses, such as dengue virus and Zika virus that cause millions of yearly infections around the globe, and coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, the source of the current pandemic. The severity of outbreaks caused by these viruses stresses the importance of research aimed at determining methods to limit virus spread and to curb disease severity. Such studies require molecular tools to decipher virus-host interactions and to develop effective treatments. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of a reporter system that can be used to visualize and identify cells infected with dengue virus or SARS-CoV-2. This system is based on viral protease activity that mediates cleavage and nuclear translocation of an engineered fluorescent protein stably expressed in cells. We show the suitability of this system for live cell imaging, for visualization of single infected cells, and for screening and testing of antiviral compounds. With the integrated modular building blocks, this system is easy to manipulate and can be adapted to any virus encoding a protease, thus offering a high degree of flexibility.IMPORTANCE Reporter systems are useful tools for fast and quantitative visualization of virus infected cells within a host cell population. Here we describe a reporter system that takes advantage of virus-encoded proteases that are expressed in infected cells to cleave an ER-anchored fluorescent protein fused to a nuclear localization sequence. Upon cleavage, the GFP moiety translocates to the nucleus, allowing for rapid detection of the infected cells. Using this system, we demonstrate reliable reporting activity for two major human pathogens from the Flaviviridae and the Coronaviridae families: dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2. We apply this reporter system to live cell imaging and use it for proof-of-concept to validate antiviral activity of a nucleoside analogue. This reporter system is not only an invaluable tool for the characterization of viral replication, but also for the discovery and development of antivirals that are urgently needed to halt the spread of these viruses.","Pahmeier, Felix; Neufeldt, Christopher J; Cerikan, Berati; Prasad, Vibhu; Pape, Costantin; Laketa, Vibor; Ruggieri, Alessia; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Cortese, Mirko",J. virol,,530
477447,Does temperature and humidity influence the spread of Covid-19?: A preliminary report,2020,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear if the prevalence of COVID-19 in rheumatologic patients is similar to that of the general population. There are no reports of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in these patients. AIMS: To investigate prevalence of COVID-19 cases and seroprevalence among rheumatologic patients and the risk factors for infection. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in a rheumatologic population. An online questionnaire was sent on 31 April 2020. Blood samples from 20% sample of patients were drawn for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Patients were divided based on autoimmune (AI) diagnosis. Prevalence of COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab and by serology (seroprevalence) was compared to national data. Risk factors for infection of SARS-CoV-2 were assessed. RESULTS: The study group included 1204 patients, 74.5% had an AI diagnosis. The prevalence of COVID-19 was 0.16% in the rheumatologic patient population and 0.22% in the AI group, which was not different from prevalence in Israel on 4 May 2020 (0.18%, P = 0.912 and P = 0.759 respectively). Serologic tests were performed in 242 patients, of which five were found positive pointing to a seroprevalence of 2.07%. Exposure to a known COVID-19 patient was the only significant risk factor for being positive by swab or by serology. AI diagnosis, immunosuppression, corticosteroid, hydroxychloroquine did not influence the risk. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of COVID-19 in a population of rheumatologic patients was similar to that of the general population. Mild/asymptomatic cases may be prevalent according to serologic tests. The major risk factor for infection is exposure to a known case of COVID-19, and immunosuppression did not play a role in the risk of infection.","Eviatar, Tali; Elalouf, Ofir; Furer, Victoria; Goldstein-Lahat, Yael; Paran, Yael; Pel, Sara; Nevo, Sharon; Zisapel, Michael; Alcalay, Yifat; Elkayam, Ori",Intern Med J,,530

We systematically reviewed databases until August/15/2020 and among initial 851 articles, 30 articles entered this study (20 case reports, 4 cohorts and 6 controlled clinical trials). The types of reactions included AGEP, morbiliform drug eruptions, vasculitis, DRESS syndrome, urticarial vasculitis and etc. The treatments have been used before side effects occur, included: antimalarial, anti-viral, antibiotics, tocilizumab, enoxaparin and etc. In pandemic, we found 0.004% to 4.15% of definite drug-induced mucocutaneous reactions. The interval between drug usage and the eruption varied about few hours to 1 month; tightly dependent to the type of drug and hydroxychloroqine seems to be the drug with highest mean interval. Antivirals, antimalarials, azithromycin and tocilizumab are most responsive drugs for adverse drug reactions, but antivirals especially in combination with antimalarial drugs are in the first step. Types of skin reactions are usually morbilliform/exanthematous maculopapular rashes or urticarial eruptions which mostly may manage by steroids during few days. In the setting of HCQ, specific reactions like AGEP should be considered. lopinavir/ritonavir is the most prevalent used drug among antivirals with the highest skin adverse reaction; ribarivin and remdisivir also could induce cutaneous drug reactions but favipiravir has no or less adverse effects. Logically the rate of dermatologic adverse effects among anivirals may relate to their frequency of usage. Rarely, potentially life-threatening reactions may occur. Better management strategies could achieve by knowing more about drug-induced mucocutaneous presentations of COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

However, the role of a teacher is equally vital in shaping students' career preference. OBJECTIVE: This study therefore explored students' perspectives of their gerontological nurse teachers' abilities and its association with students' willingness to work in older people nursing. DESIGN: A cross-sectional correlation study. SETTING: Five Universities of Applied Sciences in Finland. PARTICIPANTS: Undergraduate nursing students (N = 243). METHOD: A self-administered survey using the Gerontological Nurse Teacher Scale (GeNTS) and the subscale (Willingness) of the Students' Interest in Nursing Older People Scale (SINOPS). Descriptive and inferential analysis were conducted using SPSS. RESULTS: There was a moderate positive association (R = 0.25, N = 243, p = 0.000) between students' perspectives of their gerontological nurse teachers' abilities and students' willingness to work in older people nursing. The teachers' abilities to develop gerontological nursing course most influence students' willingness in older people nursing (r = 0.26, p = 0.001), whereas their knowledge and interest in gerontology, least influenced students' willingness in older people nursing (r = 0.14, p = 0.025). Also, the teachers abilities to address students' concerns about aging, promote gerontology careers, and demonstrate leadership skills in gerontology all had a similar statistically significant moderate positive association (r = 0.23, p = 0.001) with students' willingness to work in older people nursing. CONCLUSION: Faculty need to ensure that there is adequate personal with expertise in gerontological nursing to advocate for resources to establish a reputable gerontological nursing profile in nursing curriculum and to develop and sustain a positive attitude towards older people nursing among students and staff. A qualitative study is needed to understand the reasons behind students' ratings.","Garbrah, William; Kankkunen, Päivi; Välimäki, Tarja",Nurse Educ Today,,530

Currently only few sequences are available from three states in India. Kerala was the first state to deposit complete sequence from two isolates followed by one from Gujarat. On April 27, 2020, the first five sequences from the state of West Bengal (Eastern India) were deposited on GISAID, a global initiative for sharing avian flu data. In this study, we have analysed the spike protein sequences from all five isolates and also compared their similarities or differences with other sequences reported in India and with isolates of Wuhan origin. We report one unique mutation at position 723 and another at 1124 in the S2 domain of spike protein of the isolates from West Bengal only. There was one mutation downstream of the receptor binding domain at position 614 in S1 domain which was common with the sequence from Gujarat (a state of western India). Mutation in the S2 domain showed changes in the secondary structure of the spike protein at region of the mutation. We also studied molecular dynamics using normal mode analyses and found that this mutation decreases the flexibility of S2 domain. Since both S1 and S2 are important in receptor binding followed by entry in the host cells, such mutations may define the affinity or avidity of receptor binding.","Begum, Feroza; Mukherjee, Debica; Thagriki, Dluya; Das, Sandeepan; Tripathi, Prem Prakash; Banerjee, Arup Kumar; Ray, Upasana",F1000Res,,530

The mathematical definition of the fractal dimension provides a way to estimate the complexity of the non-linear dynamic behavior exhibited by the time series of the countries. Fuzzy logic offers a way to represent and handle the inherent uncertainty of the classification problem. The hybrid intelligent approach is composed of a fuzzy system formed by a set of fuzzy rules that uses the fractal dimensions of the data as inputs and produce as a final output the classification of countries. The hybrid approach calculations are based on the COVID-19 data of confirmed and death cases. The main contribution is the proposed hybrid approach composed of the fractal dimension definition and fuzzy logic concepts for achieving an accurate classification of countries based on the complexity of the COVID-19 time series data. Publicly available datasets of 11 countries have been the basis to construct the fuzzy system and 15 different countries were considered in the validation of the proposed classification approach. Simulation results show that a classification accuracy over 93% can be achieved, which can be considered good for this complex problem.","Castillo, Oscar; Melin, Patricia",,,530

METHODS: This cross-sectional, survey-based, isolation area-stratified study collected demographic data, sleep status and emotional measurements from 1036 HPCD in nine medical institutions from March 5 to 9, 2020 in Wuhan, China, which was the epicenter of the epidemic. HPCD who worked in isolation areas with COVID-19 were eligible for inclusion. The severity of symptoms of sleep disorders, insomnia and emotional self-efficacy were assessed by the Chinese versions of the 10-item Self-rating sleeping situation scale, the seven-item Insomnia Severity Index and the 12-item Regulatory emotional self-efficacy questionnaire, respectively. Univariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with sleep disturbances. A structural equation model (SEM) was constructed via AMOS to explore the relationship among the four components. RESULTS: A total of 1036 out of 1075 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 96.4%. A total of 925 (89.3%) were aged 20-39 years, and 755 (72.9%) were women. Among all participants, 874 (84.4%) were nurses, and 162 (15.6%) were physicians; 538 (51.9%) worked in intensive care isolation units; 843 (81.4%) worked in isolation areas for 4 h straight, and 395 (38.1%) perceived COVID-19 peer exposure. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of sleep disorders (543, 52.4%). Exposure status and length of work were the main factors affecting sleep status, which had indirect effects on sleep status by mediating regulatory emotional self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: In this survey of HPCD for patients with COVID-19 in China, participants reported experiencing sleep disturbance burdens, especially those having exposure experience and working long shifts. Regulatory emotional self-efficacy (RESE) is an important resource for alleviating sleep disturbances and improving sleep quality. These findings emphasize the importance of being prepared to support HPCD through psychological interventions.","Yang, Guoli; Li, Chunlin; Zhu, Xiao; Yan, Jin; Liu, Jia",Sleep Med,,530

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of primary prophylaxis (PP) with biosimilar filgrastim-sndz in patients with intermediate risk of FN compared with secondary prophylaxis (SP) over three different cancer types. METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was constructed from the US payer perspective over a lifetime horizon to evaluate PP versus SP in patients with breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Cost-effectiveness was evaluated over a range of willingness-to-pay thresholds for incremental cost per FN avoided, life year gained, and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses evaluated uncertainty. RESULTS: Compared with SP, PP provided an additional 0.102-0.144 LYs and 0.065-0.130 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ranged from $5,660 in US dollars (USD) to $20,806 USD per FN event avoided, $5,123 to $31,077 USD per life year gained, and $7,213 to $35,563 USD per QALY gained. Over 1,000 iterations, there were 73.6%, 99.4%, and 91.8% probabilities that PP was cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $50,000 USD per QALY gained for breast cancer, NSCLC, and NHL, respectively. CONCLUSION: PP with a biosimilar filgrastim (specifically filgrastim-sndz) is cost-effective in patients with intermediate risk for FN receiving curative chemotherapy regimens for breast cancer, NSCLC, and NHL. Expanding the use of colony-stimulating factors for patients may be valuable in reducing unnecessary health care visits for patients with cancer at risk of complications because of COVID-19 and should be considered for the indefinite future.","Li, Edward; Mezzio, Dylan J; Campbell, David; Campbell, Kim; Lyman, Gary H",JCO Oncol Pract,,530

In this paper, we evaluate the impact on the Internet latency caused by the increased amount of human activities that are carried out on-line. The study focuses on Italy, which experienced significant restrictions imposed by local authorities, but results about Spain, France, Germany, Sweden, and the whole Europe are also included. The analysis of a large set of measurements shows that the impact on the network is significant, especially in terms of increased variability of latency. In Italy we observed that the standard deviation of the additional delay -- the additional time with respect to the minimum for a given path -- during lockdown is ~3-6 times as much as the value before the pandemic. Similarly, packet loss is ~1.4-7 times as much as before the pandemic. The impact is not negligible also for the other countries and for the whole Europe, but with different levels and distinct patterns.","Candela, Massimo; Luconi, Valerio; Vecchio, Alessio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06127v1.pdf,530

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In May and June 2020, Australian residents who believed themselves eligible to donate blood responded to measures assessing constructs from an integrated protection motivation theory, organizational trust, and theory of planned behavior framework, with donor status also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 507 residents (47% male, mean age 28.69 years; 272 had donated/attempted to donate) participated. A revised structural equation model was a good fit to these data. In this model, perceived risk, severity, anxiety, and response cost associated with donating during the COVID-19 pandemic underpinned threat appraisals, while response efficacy, self-efficacy, and attitude toward donating during COVID-19 informed coping appraisals. Trust in the BCA predicted lower threat and higher coping appraisals, and higher coping appraisals predicted stronger subjective norms. Intention to donate during the COVID-19 pandemic was positively predicted by subjective norm and self-efficacy. Donation-related behavior was positively predicted by intention, with this relationship stronger for nondonors than donors. CONCLUSION: Self-efficacy and approval from others, underpinned by coping appraisals and organizational trust, play a critical role in intentions to donate. BCAs that focus on maintaining trust with (potential) donors, providing clear messaging stating the minimal threat of contracting COVID-19 from donating and the protective measures in place, and showing how donating is achievable, may help to ensure a safe and secure blood supply throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.","Masser, Barbara M; Hyde, Melissa K; Ferguson, Eamonn",Transfusion,,530

In the absence of trials, evidence for treatment remains scarce. Purpose: To develop best practice recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of children with PIMS-TS in Switzerland. It is acknowledged that the field is changing rapidly, and regular revisions in the coming months are pre-planned as evidence is increasing. Methods: Consensus guidelines for best practice were established by a multidisciplinary group of Swiss pediatric clinicians with expertise in intensive care, immunology/rheumatology, infectious diseases, hematology, and cardiology. Subsequent to literature review, four working groups established draft recommendations which were subsequently adapted in a modified Delphi process. Recommendations had to reach >80% agreement for acceptance. Results: The group achieved agreement on 26 recommendations, which specify diagnostic approaches and interventions across anti-inflammatory, anti-infectious, and support therapies, and follow-up for children with suspected PIMS-TS. A management algorithm was derived to guide treatment depending on the phenotype of presentation, categorized into PIMS-TS with (a) shock, (b) Kawasaki-disease like, and (c) undifferentiated inflammatory presentation. Conclusion: Available literature on PIMS-TS is limited to retrospective or prospective observational studies. Informed by these cohort studies and indirect evidence from other inflammatory conditions in children and adults, as well as guidelines from international health authorities, the Swiss PIMS-TS recommendations represent best practice guidelines based on currently available knowledge to standardize treatment of children with suspected PIMS-TS. Given the absence of high-grade evidence, regular updates of the recommendations will be warranted, and participation of patients in trials should be encouraged.","Schlapbach, Luregn J.; Andre, Maya C.; Grazioli, Serge; Schöbi, Nina; Ritz, Nicole; Aebi, Christoph; Agyeman, Philipp; Albisetti, Manuela; Bailey, Douggl G.

Understanding the level of public attention—a prerequisite for effective communication—implicates expensive and time-consuming surveys. We hypothesise that the relative search volume from Google Trends could be used as an indicator of public attention of a disease and its prevention measures. The search terms ‘RKI’ (Robert Koch Institute, national public health authority in Germany), ‘corona’ and ‘protective mask’ in German language were shortlisted. Cross-correlations between these terms and the reported cases from 15 February to 27 April were conducted for each German federal state. The findings were contrasted against a timeline of official communications concerning COVID-19. The highest correlations of the term ‘RKI’ with reported COVID-19 cases were found between lags of − 2 and − 12 days, meaning web searches were already performed from 2 to 12 days before case numbers increased. A similar pattern was seen for the term ‘corona’. Cross-correlations indicated that most searches on ‘protective mask’ were performed from 6 to 12 days after the peak of cases. The results for the term ‘protective mask’ indicate a degree of confusion in the population. This is supported by conflicting recommendations to wear face masks during the first wave.

This relationship allows the host to maintain the balance between active immunity to pathogens and vaccines and tolerance to self-antigens and food antigens. In children living in low-income and middle-income countries, undernourishment and repetitive gastrointestinal infections are associated with the failure of oral vaccines. Intestinal dysbiosis associated with these environmental influences, as well as some host-related factors, compromises immune responses and negatively impacts vaccine efficacy. To understand how immune responses to viral vaccines can be optimally modulated, mechanistic studies of the relationship between the microbiome, host genetics, viral infections and the development and function of the immune system are needed. We discuss the potential role of the microbiome in modulating vaccine responses in the context of a growing understanding of the relationship between the gastrointestinal microbiota, host related factors (including histo-blood group antigens) and resident immune cell populations.","Vlasova, Anastasia N; Takanashi, Sayaka; Miyazaki, Ayako; Rajashekara, Gireesh; Saif, Linda J",Curr Opin Virol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187962571930015X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187962571930015X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163292/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2019.05.001,530

600865,Essential role of communication to alleviate the COVID-19 Pandemic fear,2021-05-31,"The purpose of the present paper is to present simple estimation and prediction methods for basic quantities in an emerging epidemic like the ongoing covid-10 pandemic. The simple methods have the advantage that relations between basic quantities become more transparent, thus shedding light to which quantities have biggest impact on predictions, with the additional conclusion that uncertainties in these quantities carry over to high uncertainty also in predictions. A simple non-parametric prediction method for future cumulative case fatalities, as well as future cumulative incidence of infections (assuming a given infection fatality risk f), is presented. The method uses cumulative reported case fatalities up to present time as input data. It is also described how the introduction of preventive measures of a given magnitude ρ will affect the two incidence predictions, using basic theory of epidemic models. This methodology is then reversed, thus enabling estimation of the preventive magnitude ρ, and of the resulting effective reproduction number RE. However, the effects of preventive measures only start affecting case fatalities some 3-4 weeks later, so estimates are only available after this time has elapsed. The methodology is applicable in the early stage of an outbreak, before, say, 10% of the community have been infected. Beside giving simple estimation and prediction tools for an ongoing epidemic, another important conclusion lies in the observation that the two quantities f (infection fatality risk) and ρ (the magnitude of preventive measures) have very big impact on predictions. Further, both of these quantities currently have very high uncertainty: current estimates of f lie in the range 0.2% up to 2% ([9], [7]), and the overall effect of several combined preventive measures is clearly very uncertain. The two main findings from the paper are hence that, a) any prediction containing f, and/or some preventive measures, contain a large amount of uncertainty (which is usually not acknowledged well enough), and b) obtaining more accurate estimates of in particular f, should be highly prioritized. Seroprevalence testing of random samples in a community where the epidemic has ended are urgently needed.","Britton, Tom",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045575,530

The Enterobacteriaceae is currently considered as the most taxonomically diverse among all seven recognized families. The emergence of carbapenem resistance (CR) in Enterobacteriaceae caused by hydrolytic enzymes called carbapenemases has become a major concern worldwide. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) isolates have been reported not only in nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens but also in food-producing animals, companion animals, and the environment. The reported carbapenemases in Enterobacteriaceae from different sources belong to the Ambler class A (bla(KPC)), class B (bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(NDM)), and class D (bla(OXA-48)) β-lactamases. The carbapenem encoding genes are often located on plasmids or associated with various mobile genetic elements (MGEs) like transposons and integrons, which contribute significantly to their spread. These genes are most of the time associated with other antimicrobial resistance genes such as other β-lactamases, as well as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones resistance genes leading to multidrug resistance phenotypes. Control strategies to prevent infections due to CRE and their dissemination in human, animal and food have become necessary. Several factors involved in the emergence of CRE have been described.

Various social interventions can be helpful but are not always offered to patients who would benefit from them. This guideline aims to help oncology professionals address the psychosocial aspects of their adult patients and of those who care for them. It was compiled by a multidisciplinary panel, including patients, using rigorous methodology. Topics include patient information and communication, screening and management of psychosocial needs, and caregiver support. In particular, evidence emphasizes that nurses play a central role in providing psychosocial care and information for cancer patients, and that Physician communication skills must be improved with specific evidence-based training. In addition, psychosocial needs must be promptly detected and managed, especially with appropriate non-pharmacological interventions. ABSTRACT: Psychosocial morbidity can have negative consequences for cancer patients, including maladaptive coping, poor treatment adherence, and lower quality of life. Evidence shows that psychosocial interventions can positively impact quality of life, as well as symptoms and side effects; however, they are not always offered to patients who might benefit from them. These guidelines were produced by a multidisciplinary panel of 16 experts, including patients, following GRADE methodology. The panel framed clinical questions and voted on outcomes to investigate. Studies identified by rigorous search strategies were assessed to rate certainty of evidence, and recommendations were formulated by the panel. Although the quality of the evidence found was generally moderate, interventions could be recommended aimed at improving patient information, communication with healthcare professionals and involvement in decision-making; detecting and managing patient psychosocial needs, particularly with non-pharmacological therapy; and supporting families of patients with advanced cancer. The role of nurses as providers of information and psychosocial care is stressed. Most recommended interventions do not appear to necessitate new services or infrastructures, and therefore do not require allocation of additional resources, but predominantly involve changes in clinical staff behavior and/or ward organization. Patients should be made aware of psychosocial care standards so that they can expect to receive them.","Caminiti, Caterina; Diodati, Francesca; Annunziata, Maria Antonietta; Di Giulio, Paola; Isa, Luciano; Mosconi, Paola; Nanni, Maria Giulia; Patrini, Adele; Piredda, Michela; Santangelo, Claudia; Verusio, Claudio; Cinquini, Michela; Fittipaldo, Veronica Andrea; Passalacqua, Rodolfo",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34638360/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13194878,530

The SARS-CoV-2 genome has a similarity to the genomes of other coronaviruses, which are pathogenic for humans and cause a severe course of infection: 79% to the SARS-CoV genome and 50% to the MERS-CoV genome. The most significant differences between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses are recorded in the structure of the gene of the S protein, a key protein responsible for the virus binding to the receptor of the host organism cells. In particular, substitutions in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, leading to the formation of the furin cleavage site that is absent in other SARS-like coronaviruses, were identified, which may explain the high pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. In humans, the genes that are significant for the initial stages of infection include ACE2, ANPEP, DPP4 (encode receptors for coronavirus binding); TMPRSS2, FURIN, TMPRSS11D, CTSL, CTSB (encode proteases involved in the entry of the coronavirus into the cell); DDX1 (the gene of ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX1, which promotes replication of coronaviruses); and IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 (encode interferon-induced transmembrane proteins with an antiviral effect). These genes are expressed in many tissues (including those susceptible to the effects of SARS-CoV-2); rare and frequent variants that affect the structure of the encoded protein and its properties and expression level are described in them. A number of common genetic variants with proven functional significance are characterized by the variability in the allele frequency in the world’s populations, which can determine interpopulation differences in the prevalence of COVID-19 and in the clinical features of the course of this pathology. The expression level of genes that are important for the formation of the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 is affected by epigenetic modifications, comorbidities at the time of infection, taking medications, and bad habits.","Kucher, A.

621198,Seizure after recovery from Covid-19,2021-07-30,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and belongs to the family Coronaviridae that causes sickness varying from the common cold to more severe illnesses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, sudden stroke, neurological complications (Neuro-COVID), multiple organ failure, and mortality in some patients. The gene expression profiles of COVID-19 infection models can be used to decipher potential therapeutics for COVID-19 and related pathologies, such as Neuro-COVID. Here, we used the raw RNA-seq reads (Single-End) in quadruplicates derived using Illumina Next Seq 500 from SARS-CoV-infected primary human bronchial epithelium (NHBE) and mock-treated NHBE cells obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (GSE147507), and the quality control (QC) was evaluated using the CLC Genomics Workbench 20.0 (Qiagen, United States) before the RNA-seq analysis using BioJupies web tool and iPathwayGuide for gene ontologies (GO), pathways, upstream regulator genes, small molecules, and natural products. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics data (GSE163005) of meta clusters of immune cells from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), such as T-cells/natural killer cells (NK) (TcMeta), dendritic cells (DCMeta), and monocytes/granulocyte (monoMeta) cell types for comparison, namely, Neuro-COVID versus idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), were analyzed using iPathwayGuide. L1000 fireworks display (L1000FWD) and L1000 characteristic direction signature search engine (L1000 CDS(2)) web tools were used to uncover the small molecules that could potentially reverse the COVID-19 and Neuro-COVID-associated gene signatures. We uncovered small molecules such as camptothecin, importazole, and withaferin A, which can potentially reverse COVID-19 associated gene signatures. In addition, withaferin A, trichostatin A, narciclasine, camptothecin, and JQ1 have the potential to reverse Neuro-COVID gene signatures. Furthermore, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) preranked method and Metascape web tool were used to decipher and annotate the gene signatures that were potentially reversed by these small molecules. In conclusion, our study unravels a rapid approach for applying next-generation knowledge discovery (NGKD) platforms to discover small molecules with therapeutic potential against COVID-19 and its related disease pathologies.","Pushparaj, Peter Natesan; Abdulkareem, Angham Abdulrahman; Naseer, Muhammad Imran",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.688227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34531741/,530

AIM: The purpose of this observational longitudinal study was to evaluate psychosocial perspectives among patients with cancer on intravenous treatment during the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study recruited 164 cancer patients undergoing intravenous anti‐neoplastic therapy in a tertiary cancer center. Psychosocial indices were assessed at two points in time, corresponding with the beginning of the first wave of COVID‐19 pandemic in Israel (March 2020) and the time of easing of restrictions implemented to curtail spread of infection (May 2020). At Time 1 (T1), elevated COVID‐19 distress levels (score 1 and 2 on 5‐point scale) were observed in 44% of patients, and associated with pre‐existing hypertension and lung disease in multivariate analyses but no demographic or cancer related factors. At Time 2 (T2), 10% had elevated anxiety and 24% depression as indicated by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS‐A/D). COVID‐19 distress at T1 was related to higher levels of HADS‐A at T2 (Spearman 0.33 p < .01), but not HADS‐D. Patients with breast cancer expressed greater COVID‐19 distress compared with other cancer types (p < .01), while both HADS‐A and HADS‐D were highest for patients with GI cancer. Patient report of loneliness and decreased support from relatives were factors associated with HADS‐A (p = .03 and p < .01, respectively), while HADS‐D was not similarly related to the factors evaluated. CONCLUSION: Patients with cancer undergoing intravenous treatment may be vulnerable to acute adverse psychological ramifications of COVID‐19, specifically exhibiting high levels of anxiety. These appear unrelated to patient age or disease stage. Those with underlying comorbidities, breast cancer or reduced social support may be at higher risk.","Turgeman, Ilit; Goshen‐Lago, Tal; Waldhorn, Ithai; Karov, Keren; Groisman, Leora; Reiner Benaim, Anat; Almog, Ronit; Halberthal, Michael; Ben‐Aharon, Irit",Cancer Rep (Hoboken),https://doi.org/10.1002/cnr2.1506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34405968/,530

Enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses, use host lipids in various stages of the viral life cycle, particularly in the formation of replication compartments and envelopes. Host lipids are utilised by the virus in receptor binding, viral fusion and entry, as well as viral replication. Association of dyslipidaemia with the pathological development of Covid‐19 raises the possibility that exploitation of host lipid metabolism might have therapeutic benefit against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). In this review, promising host lipid targets are discussed along with potential inhibitors. In addition, specific host lipids are involved in the inflammatory responses due to viral infection, so lipid supplementation represents another potential strategy to counteract the severity of viral infection. Furthermore, switching the lipid metabolism through a ketogenic diet is another potential way of limiting the effects of viral infection. Taken together, restricting the access of host lipids to the virus, either by using lipid inhibitors or supplementation with exogenous lipids, might significantly limit SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and/or severity.","Alketbi, Eman Humaid; Hamdy, Rania; El‐Kabalawy, Abdalla; Juric, Viktorija; Pignitter, Marc; A.

Definitive diagnosis of PDD has been problematic due to the inconsistent distribution of lesions. Since its discovery, avian bornavirus (ABV) has been successfully cultured from the brains of psittacines diagnosed with PDD, providing a source of antigen for serologic assays and nucleic acid for molecular assays. This article provides evidence that ABV is the etiologic agent of PDD. Recent findings on the transmission, epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and control of ABV infection and PDD are also reviewed.","Hoppes, Sharman; Gray, Patricia L.; Payne, Susan; Shivaprasad, H.L.; Tizard, Ian",Vet Clin North Am Exot Anim Pract,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1094919410000769; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cvex.2010.05.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094919410000769; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20682432/,530
627296,Influence of COVID-19 Lockdowns on the Usage of a Vision Assistance App Among Global Users With Visual Impairment: Big Data Analytics Study,2021-05-12,"Abstract There are presently two competitive theories that attempt to explain the etiology of multiple sclerosis (MS). Briefly summarized, they are: 1. An infection, probably of viral type, may attack the oligodendroglia of the central nervous system; or, 2. An autoimmune process may begin with an infection of the peripheral lymphatic immune system, producing antibodies that cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to myelinoclasia. Since 1935, research has been directed toward myelin of the central nervous system and the myelin sheaths of peripheral nerve; however, dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia (DRG) have apparently not been studied. The present hypothesis states that an infectious agent (probably viral) finds privileged sanctuary in the dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia (DRG): thereafter periodically invading the spinal cord, brain, or peripheral nerve. Previously reported erratic spinal fluid viral titers and cultures can be explained by differences in the anatomy of the DRG in which there is a variable and limited contact of spinal fluid with sensory ganglia. Clues to this hypothesis were noted by the author during routine neurological examinations of patients with MS, in which sensory signs and symptoms were frequently encountered. This clinical observation has also been reported by others who found such symptoms in 75% of MS patients, ranking second only to incoordination.","Nelson, D.

627651,Dental trauma during COVID,2021-04-23,"Human rhinovirus (HRV)-A and -B is a common cause of upper respiratory tract infections. Recently, a third species, HRV-C, was categorized based on molecular typing studies. The results showed that the HRV-C genome had diverged from that of HRV-A and -B. Despite its late identification, increasing evidence suggests that HRV-C causes more severe pathogenic infections than HRV-A or -B; however, a large amount of epidemiological data is required to confirm this association in different clinical settings. Consequently, a simple and rapid method for identifying HRV-C is required to expedite such epidemiological studies. Here, two degenerate primer sets (HEV and HRVC) were designed based on bioinformatic analyses. The HEV set targeting the fifth IRES domain sequence within the 5′-UTR, which is highly conserved among enteroviruses, was designed to detect all enteroviruses, whereas the HRVC set, which targeted the VP2 coding region, was designed to detect HRV-C alone. Both primer sets were tested against a panel of standard enteroviruses and clinical lavage samples. HEV detected all enteroviruses tested whereas HRVC was specific for HRV-C. Although the primer design strategy was confirmed with a limited number of samples, extensive tests are required to be applied in clinical settings.","Nam, Young Ran; Lee, Uk; Choi, Han Seok; Lee, Kyoung Jin; Kim, Nari; Jang, Yong Ju; Joo, Chul Hyun",J Virol Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25483126/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2014.10.021; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093414004406; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093414004406,530

This international qualitative study captured the global impact on vascular patient care during the first pandemic wave. Methods: An online structured survey was used to collect regular unit-level data regarding the modification to a wide range of vascular services and treatment pathways on a global scale. Results: The survey commenced on 23rd March 2020 worldwide. Over six weeks, 249 vascular units took part in 53 countries (465 individual responses). Overall, 65% of units stopped carotid surgery for anyone except patients with crescendo symptoms or offered surgery on a case-by-case basis, 25% only intervened for symptomatic aortic aneurysms cancelling all elective repairs. For patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease 60% of units moved to an endovascular-first strategy. For patients who had previously undergone endovascular aortic aneurysm repair, 31.8% of units stopped all postoperative surveillance. Of those units regularly engaging in multidisciplinary team meetings, 59.5% of units stopped regular meetings and 39.1% had not replaced them. Further, 20% of units did not have formal personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines in place and 25% reported insufficient PPE availability.

A 48-year-old man with obesity was hospitalized with a severe form of Covid-19 infection, complicated with acute respiratory failure, septic shock, dilated cardiomyopathy and fungemia. Despite treatment with prophylactic enoxaparin (initial D-Dimer 1.14 µg/ml FEU (normal < 0.05 µg/ml FEU), D-Dimer increased to above 20 µg/ml FEU and patient continued to spike high fevers. This prompted further investigations and upper and lower extremities DVTs were confirmed and managed with enoxaparin 1mg/kg twice daily. D-dimer level decreased to 4.98 µg/ml FEU while on therapeutic anticoagulation. Three weeks later pending hospital discharge, the anticoagulation was switched to oral apixaban 10 mg twice daily. Patient developed acute severe right eye visual loss of no light perception and was diagnosed with incomplete OAO. D-Dimer was elevated at 2.13 µg/ml FEU.

Understanding providers’ perceptions of telehealth usage in rural communities may help other communities understand barriers and concerns related to implementation, during and post-pandemic. This study aimed to (a) examine rates of telemedicine use among rural providers, (b) determine whether changes in telehealth use in this group were associated with provider confidence and perceived usefulness of technology, (c) compare these providers’ perceptions of the “usefulness” of technology prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (d) examine barriers to implementation and use of telehealth within a rural sample. METHOD: Six-hundred eighty-six medical providers working at a rural Pennsylvania teaching hospital and associated satellite clinics were surveyed anonymously. Surveys included the Perceived Usefulness of Technology Scale and questions to identify barriers that prohibited the use of telehealth. FINDINGS/RESULTS: Of 136 respondents, 86% reported no prior experience using virtual technology for patient encounters. Use of telehealth care increased by 34% following the pandemic. Provider confidence in his/her/their abilities was positively associated with increased use of telehealth and perceived usefulness of technology. Provider-identified barriers to implementation included necessity of physical exams and lack of technological literacy.

We reviewed the records of patients affected by acute appendicitis (AA) during the COVID-19 pandemic period in a large Italian COVID-19 pandemic area. Methods: Data regarding demographics, age, macroscopic and microscopic findings, and time between symptom onset and PED admission of patients affected by confirmed AA in the period between March and April 2020 were considered. The data were compared with those obtained during the same period of 2019, 2018, and 2017 in the included centers. Data were quoted as median (range) or absolute number. Non-parametric statistical tests were used to compare groups. A p ≤ 0.05 was regarded as significant. Since only anonymous data have been used and the data storage meets current data protection regulations, ethical committee approval was not required for this study. Results: Eighty-six patients underwent surgical appendectomy for AA between February 20th, 2020 and April 20th, 2020; 32.5% were complicated appendicitis and 67.5% were uncomplicated. Fifty-three patients were males and 33 were females. Patients' age ranged from 3 to 17 years and the median age was 10 years.

634397,Linking Emergency Preparedness and Health Care Worker Vaccination Against Influenza: A Novel Approach,2016-11-16,"Background: Clinical features of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection seem to differ in children compared to that in adults. It has been hypothesized that the lower clinical severity in children could be influenced by differential expression of the main host functional receptor to SARS-CoV-2, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), but data are still conflicting. To explore the origin of age-dependent clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we comparatively evaluated the expression in children and adult subjects of the most relevant mediators of the SARS-CoV-2 infection: ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1), transmembrane serine protease-2 (TMPRSS2), and neuropilin-1 (NRP1), at upper respiratory tract and small intestine level. Methods: The expression of ACE2, ACE1, TMPRSS2, and NRP1 in nasal epithelium and in small intestine epithelium was investigated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Results: We found no differences in ACE2, ACE1, and TMPRSS2 expression in the nasal epithelium comparing children and adult subjects. In contrast, nasal epithelium NRP1 expression was lower in children compared to that in adults. Intestinal ACE2 expression was higher in children compared to that in adults, whereas intestinal ACE1 expression was higher in adults. Intestinal TMPRSS2 and NRP1 expression was similar comparing children and adult subjects. Conclusions: The lower severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection observed in children may be due to a different expression of nasal NRP1, that promotes the virus interaction with ACE2. However, the common findings of intestinal symptoms in children could be due to a higher expression of ACE2 at this level. The insights from these data will be useful in determining the treatment policies and preventive measures for COVID-19.","Berni Canani, Roberto; Comegna, Marika; Paparo, Lorella; Cernera, Gustavo; Bruno, Cristina; Strisciuglio, Caterina; Zollo, Immacolata; Gravina, Antonietta Gerarda; Miele, Erasmo; Cantone, Elena; Gennarelli, Nicola; Nocerino, Rita; Carucci, Laura; Giglio, Veronica; Amato, Felice; Castaldo, Giuseppe",Front Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.697390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34395341/,530

We report a case of an immunocompromised patient who was infected despite being fully vaccinated. CASE PRESENTATION: 63-year-old female with COPD, rheumatoid arthritis on abatacept, prednisone, & methotrexate (MTX), and Sweet syndrome presented to the ED with acute non-exertional chest pain, palpitations, and dyspnea at rest. She denied fevers or chills but reported diarrhea and vomiting. She had no history of or exposure to COVID-19 and had completed her 2-dose mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination 45 days prior. On presentation she was in respiratory distress, hypotensive, tachycardic, and tachypneic. She was saturating at 86% on room air, requiring supplemental O2. Physical exam was significant for scattered bilateral wheezes. CBC showed no leukocytosis. CRP was elevated. Lactic acid, ferritin and LDH were within normal limits. D-dimer was higher than the age-adjusted cutoff;CTA of the chest revealed no PE but showed bilateral ground glass opacities with consolidations. She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. She was admitted for severe sepsis from COVID-19 pneumonitis and started on dexamethasone and remdesivir. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were positive. Given her immunocompromised status, bronchoscopy with BAL was performed and revealed copious thick secretions. Gram stain and bronchial brushings were negative for bacterial etiologies. Lavage culture was positive for aspergillus antigen and cytology revealed markedly enlarged reactive cells. Galactomannan serum antigen was positive. She was discharged on day 9 with a prolonged course of voriconazole. She had residual dyspnea on exertion but did not require supplemental O2. A nasal swab to test for variant strains was still pending. DISCUSSION: The COVID vaccine proved effective in preventing severe COVID-19 infections but trials excluded immunocompromised patients. This case of infection despite vaccination and detectable IgG titers reveals suboptimal protection. From data on pre-existing vaccines in immunocompromised patients, MTX is known to reduce immunogenicity. Our patient remained on immunosuppressants after vaccination, which may have contributed to her subsequent viral and fungal infections. Rheumatology guidelines suggest holding MTX for one to two weeks after vaccination to improve vaccine response. Employing this strategy will maximize immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised patients. CONCLUSIONS: The American College of Rheumatology recommends vaccinating patients with rheumatological conditions against SARS-CoV-2. This case highlights individual patient factors to consider in the battle against COVID-19 in immunosuppressed patients. Non-viral infections must also be considered despite the ongoing pandemic. Determining protective antibody titers can guide booster vaccine recommendations. REFERENCE #1: Sonani B, Aslam F, Goyal A, Patel J, Bansal P. COVID-19 vaccination in immunocompromised patients.

However, limited data on trends in the global burden of T2D attributed to PM2.5, particularly in different regions by social-economic levels. We evaluated the spatio-temporal changes in the disease burden of T2D attributed to PM2.5 from 1990 to 2019 in 204 countries and regions with different socio-demographic indexes (SDI). METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis with data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 (GBD2019) database. The burden of T2D attributed to PM2.5, age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and age-standardized disability-adjusted life year rate (ASDR) were estimated according to sex, age, nationality and SDI. The annual percentage change (APCs) and the average annual percentage change (AAPCs) were calculated by using the Joinpoint model to evaluate the changing trend of ASMR and ASDR attributed to PM2.5 from 1990 to 2019. The Gaussian process regression model was used to estimate the relationship of SDI with ASMR and ASDR. RESULTS: Overall, the global burden of T2D attributable to PM2.5 increased significantly since 1990, particularly in the elderly, men, Africa, Asia and low-middle SDI regions. The ASMR and ASDR of T2D attributable to PM2.5 in 2019 were 2.47 (95% CI: 1.71, 3.24) per 100,000 population and 108.98 (95% CI: 74.06, 147.23) per 100,000 population, respectively. From 1990 to 2019, the global ASMR and ASDR of T2D attributed to T2D increased by 57.32% and 86.75%, respectively. The global AAPCs of ASMR and ASDR were 1.57 (95% CI: 1.46, 1.68) and 2.17 (95% CI: 2.02, 2.32), respectively. Declining trends were observed in North America, South America, Europe, Australia, and other regions with high SDI. CONCLUSIONS: Over this 30-years study, the global T2D burden attributable to PM2.5 has increased particularly in regions with low-middle SDI. PM2.5 remains a great concern on the global burden of diabetes.","Liu, Ce; Wang, Bo; Liu, Shang; Li, Sheng; Zhang, Kai; Luo, Bin; Yang, Aimin",Environ Int,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.106725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34171589/,530

In the absence of effective vaccine, different countries have employed various other types of non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain the spread of this disease, including quarantines and lockdowns, tracking, tracing and isolation of infected individuals, and social distancing measures. Effectiveness of these and other measures of disease containment and prevention to a large degree depends on good understanding of disease dynamics, and robust mathematical models play an important role for forecasting its future dynamics. In this paper we focus on Ukraine, one of Europe's largest countries, and develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 dynamics, using latest data on parameters characterising clinical features of disease. For improved accuracy, our model includes age-stratified disease parameters, as well as age- and location-specific contact matrices to represent contacts. We show that the model is able to provide an accurate short-term forecast for the numbers and age distribution of cases and deaths. We also simulated different lockdown scenarios, and the results suggest that reducing work contacts is more efficient at reducing the disease burden than reducing school contacts, or implementing shielding for people over 60.","Kyrychko, Y.; Blyuss, K.; Brovchenko, I.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.24.20161497; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.24.20161497v1?rss=1,530
640764,COVID-19 in pregnancy: A review,2020-09-30,"BACKGROUND: The epidemiological evidence on the association of sleep quality on anxiety symptoms has been inconclusive. This study aimed to explore the association between sleep quality and anxiety symptoms in rural Chinese population and investigate whether age, lifestyles, and chronic diseases modified this association. METHODS: A total of 27,911 participants aged 18–79 years from the Henan Rural Cohort Study were included in the study. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scale. Poor sleep quality was defined as PSQI ≥6. Anxiety symptoms were evaluated with the two-item generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-2). Individual with score ≥ 3 was viewed as having anxiety symptoms. Logistic regression and restricted cubic spline were conducted to examine the association of sleep quality with anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Altogether, 6087 (21.80%) participants were poor sleepers and 1557 (5.58%) had anxiety symptoms. The odds of anxiety were increased with increment of PSQI score after fitting restricted cubic splines. The poor sleep quality was associated with a higher possibility of anxiety symptoms [odd ratio (OR): 4.60, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.70–5.72] in men, and (OR: 3.56, 95% CI: 3.10–4.09) in women for multivariable analysis. Further, stratified analyses showed that the effect of sleep quality on anxiety symptoms could be modified by age, marital status, smoking status, drinking status, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: A dose-response association between PSQI score and anxiety symptoms was found. In addition, the relationship between poor sleep quality and greater anxiety symptoms was observed in this rural population, especially in participants aged ≥60 years and those with unhealthy habits or had a chronic disease.

We evaluated the incidence of QTc prolongation among moderately and severely ill COVID‐19 patients treated with HCQ and of the existence of concomitant alternative causes. METHODS: All COVID‐19 patients treated with HCQ (between Mar 1 and Apr 14, 2020) in a tertiary medical center were included. Clinical characteristics and relevant risk factors were collected from the electronic medical records. Individual patient QTc intervals were determined before and after treatment with HCQ. The primary outcome measure sought was a composite endpoint comprised of either an increase ≥ 60 milliseconds (ms) in the QTc interval compared with pretreatment QTc, and/or a maximal QTc interval >500 ms. RESULTS: Ninety patients were included. Median age was 65 years (IQR 55‐75) and 57 (63%) were male. Thirty‐nine patients (43%) were severely or critically ill. Hypertension and obesity were common (n=23 each, 26%). QTc prolongation evolved in fourteen patients (16%). Age > 65 years, congestive heart failure, severity of disease, C‐reactive protein level, hypokalemia and furosemide treatment, were all associated with QTc prolongation. Adjusted analysis showed that QTc prolongation was five times more likely with hypokalemia [OR 5, (95% CI, 1.3‐20)], and three times more likely with furosemide treatment [ OR 3 (95% CI, 1.01‐13.7)]. CONCLUSION: In patients treated with HCQ, QTc prolongation was associated with the presence of traditional risk factors such as hypokalemia and furosemide treatment.","Fteiha, Bashar; Karameh, Hani; Kurd, Ramzi; Ziff‐Werman, Batsheva; Feldman, Itamar; Bnaya, Alon; Einav, Sharon; Orlev, Amir; Ben‐Chetrit, Eli",Int J Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33063447/,530

To clarify the state of ventilation in ultrasonic exam rooms, as an index of ventilation rate, the carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in our exam rooms was measured. Methods We measured the CO2 concentration in each exam room before the examination and 0-15 minutes after end of the exam. The subjects were 70 cases (abdomen: 24, breast: 16, neck: 16, and musculoskeletal: 14). In infant cases, one parent accompanied the patient during the examination. Results The highest CO2 concentration was 2261 ppm, observed after the breast examination. In all cases, the CO2 concentration in the exam room was highest immediately after the examination or two minutes after. Almost all cases had recovered to within 120% of the pre-examination CO2 concentrations within 15 minutes after the examination. The average CO2 concentration after ultrasonography was significantly higher for breast examinations than others. Conclusions Even in a hospital with modern ventilation equipment, the CO2 concentration in the ultrasound room was high after the exam and it takes 15 minutes to recover to the pre-exam state. Care must be taken to ensure adequate ventilation in ultrasonographic facilities.","Matsubayashi, R.

Social distancing and isolation measures have presented challenges to students’ mental health. mHealth apps and wearable sensors may help monitor students at risk of COVID-19 and support their mental well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to monitor students at risk of COVID-19 by using a wearable sensor and a smartphone-based survey. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study on undergraduate and graduate students at a public university in the Midwest United States. Students were instructed to download the Fitbit, Social Rhythms, and Roadmap 2.0 apps onto their personal smartphone devices (Android or iOS). Subjects consented to provide up to 10 saliva samples during the study period. Surveys were administered through the Roadmap 2.0 app at five timepoints: at baseline, 1 month later, 2 months later, 3 months later, and at study completion. The surveys gathered information regarding demographics, COVID-19 diagnoses and symptoms, and mental health resilience, with the aim of documenting the impact of COVID-19 on the college student population. RESULTS: This study enrolled 2158 college students between September 2020 and January 2021. Subjects are currently being followed-up for 1 academic year. Data collection and analysis are currently underway. CONCLUSIONS: This study examined student health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and assessed the feasibility of using a wearable sensor and a survey in a college student population, which may inform the role of our mHealth tools in assessing student health and well-being.

As an infection that spreads easily and has a significant mortality rate, it has caused global panic rarely seen before. Many of the measures taken by governments worldwide will have long-lasting impacts on the wellbeing of the population at large. It has been widely reported that the most vulnerable patients have been most negatively affected by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). In this study, we have tried to search the currently available data on the outcomes of infected cancer patients. Most of the data points to the very challenging nature of treating such patients. Their overall outcomes seem to be worse than in the general population, and it may be difficult to differentiate which potential complications are a result of the primary oncologic disease versus the infection. Management presents its own set of challenges, including but not limited to, deciding whether postponing cancer treatment until the infection resolves is going to benefit the patient and how to organize all aspects of patient care when social contact is as limited as it is for patients newly diagnosed with COVID-19. We believe that as more data becomes available, it is going to be necessary to publish detailed guidelines on how to approach this unique clinical challenge.","Cancarevic, Ivan; Tathineni, Praveena; Malik, Bilal Haider",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7835; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32467810/,530

India as a hub of ayurvedic and medicinal plants can shed light on its treatment using specific active bio-molecules from these plants. OBJECTIVES: Keeping our herbal resources in mind we were interested to inquire whether some phytochemicals from Indian spices and medicinal plants can be used as alternative therapeutic agents in contrast to synthetic drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used in-silico molecular docking approach to test whether bioactive molecules of herbal origin such as Hyperoside, Nimbaflavone, Ursolic acid, 6-gingerol, 6-shogaol& 6-paradol, Curcumin, Catechins&Epigallocatechin, α-Hederin, Piperine could bind and potentially block theM(pro)enzyme of Sars-CoV-2 virus. RESULTS: Ursolic acid showed the highest docking score (-8.7 kcal/mol) followed by Hyperoside (-8.6kcal/mol), α-Hederin (-8.5 kcal/mol) and Nimbaflavone (-8.0kcal/mol). Epigallocatechin, Catechins, and Curcumin also exhibited high binding affinity (Docking score -7.3, -7.1 and -7.1 kcal/mol) with the M(pro).

The novelty of the virus prompts a search for understanding of how ecological factors affect the transmission and survival of the virus. Several studies have robustly identified a relationship between temperature and the number of cases. However, there is no specific study for a tropical climate such as Brazil. This work aims to determine the relationship of temperature to COVID-19 infection for the state capital cities of Brazil. Cumulative data with the daily number of confirmed cases was collected from February 27 to April 1, 2020, for all 27 state capital cities of Brazil affected by COVID-19. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to explore the linear and nonlinear relationship between annual average temperature compensation and confirmed cases. Also, a polynomial linear regression model was proposed to represent the behavior of the growth curve of COVID-19 in the capital cities of Brazil. The GAM dose-response curve suggested a negative linear relationship between temperatures and daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the range from 16.8 °C to 27.4 °C. Each 1 °C rise of temperature was associated with a −4.8951% (t = −2.29, p = 0.0226) decrease in the number of daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19. A sensitivity analysis assessed the robustness of the results of the model. The predicted R-squared of the polynomial linear regression model was 0.81053. In this study, which features the tropical temperatures of Brazil, the variation in annual average temperatures ranged from 16.8 °C to 27.4 °C. Results indicated that temperatures had a negative linear relationship with the number of confirmed cases. The curve flattened at a threshold of 25.8 °C. There is no evidence supporting that the curve declined for temperatures above 25.8 °C. The study had the goal of supporting governance for healthcare policymakers.","Prata, David N.; Rodrigues, Waldecy; Bermejo, Paulo H.",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361443/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720323792?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720323792,530

Here, we developed a subunit nanovaccine by conjugating SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) to the surface of oxidation-sensitive polymersomes. We evaluated the humoral and cellular responses of mice immunized with these surface-decorated polymersomes (RBD(surf)) compared to RBD-encapsulated polymersomes (RBD(encap)) and unformulated RBD (RBD(free)), using monophosphoryl lipid A-encapsulated polymersomes (MPLA PS) as an adjuvant. While all three groups produced high titers of RBD-specific IgG, only RBD(surf) elicited a neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 comparable to that of human convalescent plasma. Moreover, RBD(surf) was the only group to significantly increase the proportion of RBD-specific germinal center B cells in the vaccination-site draining lymph nodes. Both RBD(surf) and RBD(encap) drove similarly robust CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses that produced multiple Th1-type cytokines. We conclude that multivalent surface display of Spike RBD on polymersomes promotes a potent neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, while both antigen formulations promote robust T cell immunity.","Volpatti, Lisa R.; Wallace, Rachel P.; Cao, Shijie; Raczy, Michal M.; Wang, Ruyi; Gray, Laura T.; Alpar, Aaron T.; Briquez, Priscilla S.; Mitrousis, Nikolaos; Marchell, Tiffany M.; Sasso, Maria Stella; Nguyen, Mindy; Mansurov, Aslan; Budina, Erica; Solanki, Ani; Watkins, Elyse A.; Schnorenberg, Mathew R.; Tremain, Andrew C.; Reda, Joseph W.; Nicolaescu, Vlad; Furlong, Kevin; Dvorkin, Steve; Yu, Shann S.; Manicassamy, Balaji; LaBelle, James L.; Tirrell, Matthew V.; Randall, Glenn; Kwissa, Marcin; Swartz, Melody A.; Hubbell, Jeffrey A.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33851166/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.08.438884,530

This phenomenon has been observed also for type 1 diabetes patients at onset, and surveys from different countries have shown an increased number of diabetic ketoacidosis during lock-down period. We report the case of two patients admitted late at our emergency care service for type-1 diabetes at onset with ketoacidosis, for reasons related to COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Case report 1: A 5 years old boy, presented with a severe diabetic ketoacidosis, requiring admission in Intensive Care Unit, prolonged intravenous insulin infusion and enteral nutrion via nasogastric tube. Case report 2: A 10 years old girl presented in the emergency department with a history respiratory distress, due to Kussmaul’s breathing, and severe dehydration. Laboratory findings were consistent with a diagnosis of moderate diabetic ketoacidosis. We have further analyzed the experience of our Centre regarding new onset type 1 diabetes patients during lock-down period: we observed a reduction of admissions for type 1 diabetes onset during lock-down period compared to same period of 2019, with a higher prevalence of moderate and severe diabetic ketoacidosis. We conclude highlighting the upcoming necessity, due to the emerging of a ‘second wave’ of the pandemic, that public opinion and healthcare practitioners provide correct information regarding access to paediatric services, in particular for children with newly onset symptoms, in order to avoid late access to emergency department in critical situations and to prevent avoidable morbidity and mortality.

However, the main dreaded complications exist in thrombosis. Leaving surgical complications aside, systemic problems like disorder of the coagulation-fibrinolysis system are a significant cause of graft loss usually being unrecognized. Reports exist describing a hypercoagulable state with clotting activation and inhibition of fibrinolysis after trauma and delayed surgery considering the secondary homeostasis. In this clinical case, a patient had a large soft tissue defect at the temporal side of the head after severe trauma. After some days of primary stabilization, reconstruction using a free microvascular latissimus dorsi flap was performed. Multiple revisions of the arterial and venous branches had to be performed intraoperatively due to insufficient flap perfusion. After 24 hours, definitive flap loss occurred due to multiple thrombosis in the arterial and venous branches. Postoperative comprehensive coagulation analysis revealed a distinct activation of primary hemostasis with massively increased von Willebrand factor parameters and factor VIII activity as well as acetylsalicylic acid resistance contributing to thrombotic occlusion. In severely injured patients, comprehensive preoperative determination of the coagulation status (especially those of the primary hemostasis) is indispensable before performing free flap reconstruction surgeries to reduce the risk of microvascular flap loss.","Rothweiler, René M.; Metzger, Marc C.; Zieger, Barbara; Huber-Schumacher, Sabine; Schmelzeisen, Rainer; Kalbhenn, Johannes",Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34616639/; https://doi.org/10.1097/gox.0000000000003836,530

This study aims to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with diabetes and secondary hyperglycemia, as well as to explore the purported mechanisms. 80 confirmed COVID-19 subjects were classified into the euglycemia group, secondary hyperglycemia group, and diabetes group. Severity of COVID-19 was defined based on the diagnostic and treatment guideline for SARS-CoV-2 issued by Chinese National Health Committee. According to the severity of the disease, patients of the mild type and common type were registered as mild cases (patients with minimal symptoms and negative CT findings), while patients of the severe type and critical type were enrolled as severe cases (patients with positive CT findings and different extent of clinical manifestations). Patients in the diabetes group were older than those in the euglycemia group, and most of them were male. In the diabetes group, the proportion of severe cases was 57.14%, which was significantly higher than those in the other two groups, and 32% of the COVID-19 patients diagnosed as severe cases were with diabetes. The CD4+ cell counts in the diabetes group were lower than those in the other two groups, while the levels of LDH and hs-CRP were higher. Compared with the euglycemia group, the CD3+ cell counts and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio were decreased, whereas the levels of IL-6 were increased in the secondary hyperglycemia group and diabetes group, with the diversities in the diabetes group being especially more significant. The Spearman correlation analysis revealed that the presence of diabetes was positively correlated with age, hs-CRP, LDH, IL-6, CD8+ cells, and severity of COVID-19 and negatively correlated with CD3+ cell counts, CD4+ cell counts, and CD4+/CD8+ ratio. Compared with the other two groups, the diabetes group exhibited more diverse and multifocal features in CT imagings. Diabetes is a risk factor for influence of the progression and prognosis of COVID-19 due to ongoing inflammation and impaired immune response.","Zhou, Wan; Ye, Shandong; Wang, Wei; Li, Sumei; Hu, Qinggang",J Diabetes Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33062712/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/3918723,530

Stewardship interventions targeted at facilitating appropriate antibiotic prescribing for CABP among COVID-19 patients are needed. We developed a guideline for antibiotic initiation and discontinuation for CABP in COVID-19 patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of this intervention on the duration of empiric CABP antibiotic therapy among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective, quasi-experimental study of adult patients admitted between 3/1/2020 to 4/25/2020 with COVID-19 pneumonia, who were initiated on empiric CABP antibiotics. Patients were excluded if they were initiated on antibiotics > 48 h following admission or if another source of infection was identified. The primary outcome was the duration of antibiotic therapy (DOT) prior to the guideline (March 1 to March27, 2020) and after guideline implementation (March 28 to April 25, 2020). We also evaluated the clinical outcomes (mortality, readmissions, length of stay) among those initiated on empiric CABP antibiotics. RESULTS: A total of 506 patients with COVID-19 were evaluated, 102 pre-intervention and 404 post-intervention. Prior to the intervention, 74.5% (n = 76) of patients with COVID-19 received empiric antibiotics compared to only 42% of patients post-intervention (n = 170), p < 0.001. The median DOT in the post-intervention group was 1.3 days shorter (p < 0.001) than the pre-intervention group, and antibiotics directed at atypical bacteria DOT was reduced by 2.8 days (p < 0.001). More patients in the post-intervention group were initiated on antibiotics based on criteria consistent with our guideline (68% versus 87%, p = 0.001). There were no differences between groups in terms of clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: Following the implementation of a guideline outlining recommendations for initiating and discontinuing antibiotics for CABP among COVID-19 inpatients, we observed a reduction in antibiotic prescribing and DOT. The guideline also resulted in a significant increase in the rate of guideline-congruent empiric antibiotic initiation.

Over 170 immunological markers were investigated in a ‘discovery’ cohort (n = 98 patients) of the Lausanne University Hospital (LUH-1). Here we report that 13 out of 49 cytokines were significantly associated with ICU admission in the three cohorts (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001), while cellular immunological markers lacked power in discriminating between ICU and non-ICU patients. The cytokine results were confirmed in two ‘validation’ cohorts, i.e. the French COVID-19 Study (FCS; n = 62) and a second LUH-2 cohort (n = 47). The combination of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13) was the best predictor of ICU admission (positive and negative predictive values ranging from 81.8% to 93.1% and 85.2% to 94.4% in the 3 cohorts) and occurrence of death during patient follow-up (8.8 fold higher likelihood of death when both cytokines were increased). Of note, HGF is a pleiotropic cytokine with anti-inflammatory properties playing a fundamental role in lung tissue repair, and CXCL13, a pro-inflammatory chemokine associated with pulmonary fibrosis and regulating the maturation of B cell response. Up-regulation of HGF reflects the most powerful counter-regulatory mechanism of the host immune response to antagonize the pro-inflammatory cytokines including CXCL13 and to prevent lung fibrosis in COVID-19 patients.","Perreau, Matthieu; Suffiotti, Madeleine; Marques-Vidal, Pedro; Wiedemann, Aurelie; Levy, Yves; Laouénan, Cédric; Ghosn, Jade; Fenwick, Craig; Comte, Denis; Roger, Thierry; Regina, Jean; Vollenweider, Peter; Waeber, Gerard; Oddo, Mauro; Calandra, Thierry; Pantaleo, Giuseppe",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34373466/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25191-5,530

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The number of patients diagnosed and treated within 17 of the 18 Unicancer centers was collected in 2020 and compared with that during the same periods between 2016 and 2019. Unicancer centers treat close to 20% of cancer patients in France yearly. The reduction in the number of patients attending the Unicancer centers was analyzed per regions and cancer types. The impact of delayed care on cancer-related deaths was calculated based on different hypotheses. RESULTS: A 6.8% decrease in patients managed within Unicancer in the first 7 months of 2020 versus 2019 was observed. This reduction reached 21% during April and May, and was not compensated in June and July, nor later until November 2020. This reduction was observed only for newly diagnosed patients, while the clinical activity for previously diagnosed patients increased by 4% similar to previous years. The reduction was more pronounced in women, in breast and prostate cancers, and for patients without metastasis. Using an estimated hazard ratio of 1.06 per month of delay in diagnosis and treatment of new patients, we calculated that the delays observed in the 5-month period from March to July 2020 may result in an excess mortality due to cancer of 1000-6000 patients in coming years. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the delays in cancer patient management were observed only for newly diagnosed patients, more frequently in women, for breast cancer, prostate cancer, and nonmetastatic cancers. These delays may result is an excess risk of cancer-related deaths in the coming years.","Blay, J.Y.; Boucher, S.; Le Vu, B.; Cropet, C.; Chabaud, S.; Perol, D.; Barranger, E.; Campone, M.; Conroy, T.; Coutant, C.; De Crevoisier, R.; Debreuve-Theresette, A.; Delord, J.P.; Fumoleau, P.; Gentil, J.; Gomez, F.; Guerin, O.; Jaffré, A.; Lartigau, E.; Lemoine, C.; Mahe, M.A.; Mahon, F.X.; Mathieu-Daude, H.; Merrouche, Y.; Penault-Llorca, F.; Pivot, X.; Soria, J.C.; Thomas, G.; Vera, P.; Vermeulin, T.; Viens, P.; Ychou, M.; Beaupere, S.",ESMO Open,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2021.100134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33984676/,530

Therefore, there is a significant unmet medical need for a safe and effective treatment for COVID‐19. Inflammation is the driving force behind coronavirus infections, and the majority of deaths caused by COVID‐19 are the result of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is crucial to control the inflammation as early as possible. To date, numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) products, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and their derivatives (eg, exosomes) for coronavirus infections, which could be applied for the COVID‐19. In this review, first, the impacts of COVID‐19 pandemic in the present and future of TERM research and products are briefly presented. Then, the recent clinical trials and the therapeutic benefits of MSCs in coronavirus‐induced ARDS are critically reviewed. Last, the recent advances in the field of tissue engineering relevant to the coronavirus infections, including three‐dimensional platforms to study the disease progression and test the effects of antiviral agents are described. Moreover, the application of biomaterials for vaccine technology, and drug delivery are highlighted. Despite promising results in the preclinical and clinical applications of MSC therapy for coronavirus infections, the controversy still exists, and thus further investigation is required to understand the efficacy of these therapies.","Shafiee, Abbas; Moradi, Lida; Lim, Mayasari; Brown, Jason",Stem Cells Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32820868/; https://doi.org/10.1002/sctm.20-0197,530

By comparison with the theories of growth and recovery in coupled socio-medical systems, we find that the data for many countries show infection rate trends that are exponential in form. In particular, the recovery trajectory is universal in trend and consistent with the learning theory, which allows for predictions useful in the assistance of decision-making of emergency recovery actions.

Identification of risk factors is crucial to prevent the COVID-19 spread by taking appropriate countermeasures effectively. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the potential risk factors contributing to the COVID-19 incidence rates at the district-level in Bangladesh. METHOD: ology: Spatial regression methods were applied in this study to fulfill the aim. Data related to 28 demographic, economic, built environment, health, and facilities related factors were collected from secondary sources and analyzed to explain the spatial variability of this disease incidence. Three global (ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial lag model (SLM), and spatial error model (SEM)) and one local (geographically weighted regression (GWR)) regression models were developed in this study. RESULTS: The results of the models identified four factors: percentage of the urban population, monthly consumption, number of health workers, and distance from the capital city, as significant risk factors affecting the COVID-19 incidence rates in Bangladesh. Among the four developed models, the GWR model performed the best in explaining the variation of COVID-19 incidence rates across Bangladesh with an R(2) value of 78.6%. CONCLUSION: Findings and discussions from this research offer a better insight into the COVID-19 situation, which helped discuss policy implications to negotiate the future epidemic crisis. The primary policy response would be to decentralize the urban population and economic activities from and around the capital city, Dhaka to create self-sufficient regions throughout the country, especially in the north-western region.","Rahman, Md.

We included 34 studies of which the majority evaluated interventions related to the H1N1 outbreak in a high-income setting. Most interventions concerned pharmaceuticals. Included costs and benefits, as well as the methods applied, varied substantially between studies. Most studies used a short time horizon and did not include future costs and benefits. We found substantial variation in the included elements and methods used. Policymakers need to be aware of this and the bias toward high-income countries and pharmaceutical interventions, which hampers generalizability.

In this study, we aimed to examine serum‐soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) and kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM‐1) levels based on the clinical course of COVID‐19. Our study included 102 patients over the age of 18 who were diagnosed as having COVID‐19 between September 2020 and December 2020 and a control group of 50 health workers over the age of 18 whose severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) PCR results were negative. KIM‐1 was measured by ELISA and suPAR by suPARnostic™ assay. Analysis of previously identified variables of prognostic significance in COVID‐19 revealed high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, lactose dehydrogenase, prothrombin time, C‐reactive protein, PaO(2)/FiO(2), D‐dimer, ferritin, and fibrinogen levels in patients with severe disease (p < 0.05 for all). KIM‐1 and suPAR levels were significantly higher in COVID‐19 patients compared to the control group (p = 0.001 for all). KIM‐1 level was higher in severe patients compared to moderate patients (p = 0.001), while suPAR level was lower (p = 0.001). KIM‐1, which is believed to play an important role in the endocytosis of SARS‐CoV‐2, was elevated in patients with severe COVID‐19 and may be a therapeutic target in the future.

678510,Examining the effectiveness of different dental recall strategies on maintenance of optimum oral health: the INTERVAL dental recalls randomised controlled trial,2021-02-26,"Widespread malnutrition of zinc (Zn), iodine (I), iron (Fe) and selenium (Se), known as hidden hunger, represents a predominant cause of several health complications in human populations where rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the major staple food. Therefore, increasing concentrations of these micronutrients in rice grain represents a sustainable solution to hidden hunger. This study aimed at enhancing concentration of Zn, I, Fe and Se in rice grains by agronomic biofortification. We evaluated effects of foliar application of Zn, I, Fe and Se on grain yield and grain concentration of these micronutrients in rice grown at 21 field sites during 2015 to 2017 in Brazil, China, India, Pakistan and Thailand. Experimental treatments were: (i) local control (LC); (ii) foliar Zn; (iii) foliar I; and (iv) foliar micronutrient cocktail (i.e., Zn + I + Fe + Se). Foliar-applied Zn, I, Fe or Se did not affect rice grain yield. However, brown rice Zn increased with foliar Zn and micronutrient cocktail treatments at all except three field sites. On average, brown rice Zn increased from 21.4 mg kg(–1) to 28.1 mg kg(–1) with the application of Zn alone and to 26.8 mg kg(–1) with the micronutrient cocktail solution. Brown rice I showed particular enhancements and increased from 11 μg kg(–1) to 204 μg kg(–1) with the application of I alone and to 181 μg kg(–1) with the cocktail. Grain Se also responded very positively to foliar spray of micronutrients and increased from 95 to 380 μg kg(–1). By contrast, grain Fe was increased by the same cocktail spray at only two sites. There was no relationship between soil extractable concentrations of these micronutrients with their grain concentrations. The results demonstrate that irrespective of the rice cultivars used and the diverse soil conditions existing in five major rice-producing countries, the foliar application of the micronutrient cocktail solution was highly effective in increasing grain Zn, I and Se. Adoption of this agronomic practice in the target countries would contribute significantly to the daily micronutrient intake and alleviation of micronutrient malnutrition in human populations.","Prom-u-thai, Chanakan; Rashid, Abdul; Ram, Hari; Zou, Chunqin; Guilherme, Luiz Roberto Guimaraes; Corguinha, Ana Paula Branco; Guo, Shiwei; Kaur, Charanjeet; Naeem, Asif; Yamuangmorn, Supapohn; Ashraf, Muhammad Yasin; Sohu, Virinder Singh; Zhang, Yueqiang; Martins, Fábio Aurélio Dias; Jumrus, Suchada; Tutus, Yusuf; Yazici, Mustafa Atilla; Cakmak, Ismail",Front Plant Sci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2020.589835; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33304367/,530

A reality check!,2021-02-27,"BACKGROUND: With the sensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction test used to detect the presence of the virus in the human host, the worldwide health community has been able to record a large number of the recovered population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the probability of reinfection in the recovered class and the model equations, which exhibits the disease-free equilibrium state for the coronavirus disease. METHODS: The model differential equation was evaluated for the disease-free equilibrium for the case of reinfection as well as the existence and stability criteria for the disease, using the model proportions. This evaluation shows that the criteria for a local or worldwide asymptotic stability with a basic reproductive number (R(0)=0) were satisfied. Hence, there is a chance of no secondary reinfections from the recovered population, as the rate of incidence of the recovered population vanishes (ie, B=0). RESULTS: With a total of about 900,000 infected cases worldwide, numerical simulations for this study were carried out to complement the analytical results and investigate the effect that the implementation of quarantine and observation procedures has on the projection of further virus spread. CONCLUSIONS: As shown by the results, the proportion of the infected population, in the absence of a curative vaccination, will continue to grow worldwide; meanwhile, the recovery rate will continue slowly, which means that the ratio of infection rate to recovery rate will determine the death rate that is recorded. Most significant for this study is the rate of reinfection by the recovered population, which will decline to zero over time as the virus is cleared clinically from the system of the recovered class.","Victor Okhuese, Alexander",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2196/19097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32369029/,530

Patient with confirmed MERS-CoV infection were not clinically distinguishable from those with negative MERS-CoV RT-PCR results although diarrhoea was commoner in MERS patients. A high level of suspicion in initiating laboratory tests for MERS-CoV is therefore indicated. Variables associated with adverse outcome were older age and diabetes as a co-morbid illness. Interestingly, co-morbid illnesses other than diabetes were not significantly associated with poor outcome.

The rapid development of promising therapeutic strategies against COVID‐19 is keenly anticipated. Family Coronaviridae comprises positive, single‐stranded RNA viruses that use RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) for viral replication and transcription. Since the RdRP of viruses in this family and others plays a pivotal role in infection, it is a promising therapeutic target for developing antiviral agents against them. A critical genetic driver for many cancers is the catalytic subunit of telomerase: human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), identified initially as an RNA‐dependent DNA polymerase. However, even though hTERT is a DNA polymerase, it has phylogenetic and structural similarities to viral RdRPs. Researchers worldwide, including the authors of this review, are engaged in developing therapeutic strategies targeting hTERT. We have published a series of papers demonstrating that hTERT has RdRP activity and that this RdRP activity in hTERT is essential for tumor formation. Here, we review the enzymatic function of RdRP in virus proliferation and tumor development, reminding us of how the study of the novel coronavirus has brought us to the unexpected intersection of cancer research and RNA virus research.","Machitani, Mitsuhiro; Yasukawa, Mami; Nakashima, Jotaro; Furuichi, Yasuhiro; Masutomi, Kenkichi",Cancer Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32805774/; https://doi.org/10.1111/cas.14618,530

RESULTS: We included 67 patients with chronic migraine or high-frequency episodic migraine under onabotulinumtoxinA treatment, 65 (97.0%) female, 44.5 ± 12.1 years old. Treatment administration was voluntarily delayed in 14 (20.9%) patients and nine (13.4%) were unable to continue follow-up. Patients with uninterrupted follow-up during lockdown presented 7.6 and 8.1 less monthly days with headache (adjusted p = 0.017) and migraine attacks (adjusted p = 0.009) compared to patients whose follow-up was interrupted, respectively. CONCLUSION: Involuntary delay of onabotulinumtoxinA follow-up in patients with migraine due to COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a higher frequency of headache and migraine attacks. Safe administration of onabotulinumtoxinA during lockdown should be promoted.

687016,Perception of the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease in the Time of Telemedicine: Cross-Sectional Questionnaire Study,2020-11-02,"OBJECTIVE: The intravitreal injection (IVI) of pharmacological agents is the most commonly performed ocular procedure and is associated with a host of complications. The majority of IVI-related complications data is derived from randomized controlled clinical trials, which report a high adverse event rate. The nature of these protocol-driven trials limit their applicability to the diverse circumstances seen in routine clinical practice. The goal of this study is to determine the prevalence of patient reported IVI-related complications, their risk factors, and the manner in which patients presented in a tertiary eye care center. DESIGN: A retrospective, IRB-approved review. SUBJECTS, PARTICIPANTS AND/OR CONTROLS: 44,734 injections in 5,318 unique patients at the Cleveland Clinic Cole Eye Institute from 2012-2016. METHODS, INTERVENTION, OR TESTING: Intravitreal injection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Complication occurrence within 15 days of injection. RESULTS: From 2012-2016, a total of 44,734 injections were performed in 5,318 unique patients. Overall, complication rates were low, representing 1.9% of all injections, with 1031 unique complications in 685 (12.9%) patients. The most common minor complications, or those not requiring intervention, were irritation (n=312) and subconjunctival hemorrhage (n=284). The most common serious complications, or those requiring intervention, were corneal abrasion (n=46) and iritis (n=31). The majority of complications (66%) were adequately managed by a telephone/Epic electronic message encounter only. Importantly, no injection protocol parameter, such as type of anesthesia, preparation, or post-injection medication, increased the risk of a complication. However, patient sex, age, number of previous injections, and provider strongly influenced the risk of patient-reported complications. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, complication rates seen in routine clinical practice were low compared to clinical trial reporting. Providers should feel confident in the safety and administration of IVI during times when follow-up office visits and resources may be limited. When performing an IVI, factors such as a patient’s sex, age, number of previous injections, and provider must be taken into account to ensure the best possible outcomes.","Ramos, Michael S.; Xu, Lucy T.; Singuri, Srinidhi; Castillo Tafur, Julio C.; Arepalli, Sruthi; Ehlers, Justis P.; Kaiser, Peter K.; Singh, Rishi P.; Rachitskaya, Aleksandra V.; Srivastava, Sunil K.; Sears, Jonathan E.; Schachat, Andrew P.; Babiuch, Amy S.; Sharma, Sumit; Martin, Daniel F.; Lowder, Careen Y.; Singh, Arun D.; Yuan, Alex; Nowacki, Amy S.",Ophthalmol Retina,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468653020304073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33059077/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oret.2020.09.024; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468653020304073?v=s5,530
688748,Geographical distribution of COVID-19 in the World and Iran; Investigation of possible transmission roots,2020-08-25,"OBJECTIVE: During the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic deferable access, including non-urgent outpatient visits, have been suspended. In our practice non-urgent routine visits for pelvic floor symptom assessment were discontinued and rescheduled, and telephone interview was performed. The aim was to evaluate patients’ satisfaction for this alternative approach. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Telephone interviews were conducted using a validated questionnaire to investigate pelvic floor symptoms. Patients were also asked if they had other symptoms or disorders, to identify patients who may need urgent hospital evaluation. At the end of the phone call, patients were asked to score their satisfaction with the telephone interview by grading their response to three questions from 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum). The questions were: 1) “Was the telephone interview useful to check your state of health?”; 2) “Was the telephone interview an adequate healthcare tool in consideration of COVID-19 outbreak?”; 3) “Could the telephone interview replace the conventional visit?”. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were evaluated. All patients showed great satisfaction with telephone interview (Q1 median: 10, IQ range: 10-10) and were similarly positive in response to the second question (Q2 median: 10, IQ range: 10-10). Although fewer patients felt that telephone interview could replace conventional clinic visits most remained positive (Q3 median: 7; IQ range: 6-8). CONCLUSION: This simple experience showed that phone interviews with validated questionnaires are appreciated and effective to safely perform interview of selected urogynecologic patients.","Barba, Marta; Manodoro, Stefano; Bosio, Sara; Locatelli, Luca; Frigerio, Matteo",J Turk Ger Gynecol Assoc,https://doi.org/10.4274/jtgga.galenos.2020.2020.0131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33506670/,530
690558,"Assessment of knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward COVID-19 virus among university students in Kurdistan region, Iraq: Online cross-sectional study",2020-09-30,"Virtual “online” teaching has been adopted by most universities around the world during the COVID-19 outbreak. This study aims to investigate the factors that might affect students’ preference for virtual learning. Since a second wave of such pandemic is expected to occur, professors and teaching assistants may want to be prepared and aware to create an effective virtual learning environment for students. Using an online survey questionnaire, a total of 488 students in their basic science years of study (first to the third year) who are enrolled in dental and medical college responded to the online survey. The authors utilized a binary logistic regression model to estimate the impact of the nine explanatory variables (gender, student's year of study, accessibility of online tools, class engagement in virtual classes, GPA change during COVID-19 outbreak, class attendance in virtual vs. in-person lectures, type of study material, time saving for virtual classes, and anxiety level during the COVID-19 outbreak) on the students' preference for virtual learning. The analysis of variance showed that three out of the nine variables were not significant to the model: gender, study level, and study material. In addition, to understand the behavioral intention for the students during such pandemic, the online survey questionnaire captured students' voice on their willingness to wear masks, wash their hands, or both as well as their acceptance to take the vaccine once it is available. The results showed that 7.02 % of the students did not change simple health behaviors and 18.43% are not interested in taking the vaccine. This implies the importance of enacting new laws for reopening universities, applying high fines for violators, and obligating students to take the vaccine since university settings have high levels of social contact with populations from different communities and countries.","Al-Azzam, Nosayba; Elsalem, Lina; Gombedza, Farai",Heliyon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33324768/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844020325470?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844020325470,530
