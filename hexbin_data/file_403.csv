3270,3270,3270,Combined Rosiglitazone and Forskolin Have Neuroprotective Effects in SD Rats after Spinal Cord Injury,9.392202,4.896356,2018-06-21,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) agonist rosiglitazone inhibits NF-κB expression and endogenous neural stem cell differentiation into neurons and reduces the inflammatory cascade after spinal cord injury (SCI). The aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms underlying rosiglitazone-mediated neuroprotective effects and regulation of the balance between the inflammatory cascade and generation of endogenous spinal cord neurons by using a spinal cord-derived neural stem cell culture system as well as SD rat SCI model. Activation of PPAR-γ could promote neural stem cell proliferation and inhibit PKA expression and neuronal formation in vitro. In the SD rat SCI model, the rosiglitazone + forskolin group showed better locomotor recovery compared to the rosiglitazone and forskolin groups. MAP2 expression was higher in the rosiglitazone + forskolin group than in the rosiglitazone group, NF-κB expression was lower in the rosiglitazone + forskolin group than in the forskolin group, and NeuN expression was higher in the rosiglitazone + forskolin group than in the forskolin group. PPAR-γ activation likely inhibits NF-κB, thereby reducing the inflammatory cascade, and PKA activation likely promotes neuronal cell regeneration.","Meng, Qing-qi; Lei, Wei; Chen, Hao; Feng, Zhen-cheng; Hu, Li-qiong; Zhang, Xing-liang; Li, Siming",PPAR Res,403,1

Currently, the risk of blood-borne agent transmission of well-known viruses (HBV, HCV, HIV and HTLV) can be considered as under control in high-resource countries. However, other viruses unknown or unsuspected may be transmitted to recipients by blood-derived products. This is particularly relevant considering that a significant proportion of transfused patients are immunocompromised and more frequently subjected to fatal outcomes. Several measures to prevent transfusion transmission of unknown viruses have been implemented including the exclusion of at-risk donors, leukocyte reduction of donor blood, and physicochemical treatment of the different blood components. However, up to now there is no universal method for pathogen inactivation, which would be applicable for all types of blood components and, equally effective for all viral families. In addition, among available inactivation procedures of viral genomes, some of them are recognized to be less effective on non-enveloped viruses, and inadequate to inactivate higher viral titers in plasma pools or derivatives. Given this, there is the need to implement new methodologies for the discovery of unknown viruses that may affect blood transfusion. Viral metagenomics combined with High Throughput Sequencing appears as a promising approach for the identification and global surveillance of new and/or unexpected viruses that could impair blood transfusion safety.","Sauvage, V.; Eloit, M.",Transfus Clin Biol,403,1

Escherichia coli, the preferred host for recombinant protein expression, presents many challenges which must be surmounted in order to over-express heterologous proteins. These challenges include the proteolytic degradation of target proteins, protein misfolding, poor solubility, and the necessity for good purification methodologies. Gene fusion technologies have been able to improve heterologous expression by overcoming many of these challenges. The ability of gene fusions to improve expression, solubility, purification, and decrease proteolytic degradation will be discussed in this review. The main disadvantage, cleaving the protein fusion, will also be addressed. Focus will be given to the newly described SUMO fusion system and the improvements that this technology has advanced over traditional gene fusion systems.","Butt, Tauseef R.; Edavettal, Suzanne C.; Hall, John P.; Mattern, Michael R.",Protein Expr Purif,403,1

Sera genes form a multigene family and are generally tandemly clustered on a single chromosome. Although all Plasmodium species encode multiple sera genes, the number varies between species. Among species, the members share similar sequences and gene organization. SERA possess a central papain-like cysteine protease domain, however, in some members, the active site cysteine residue is substituted with a serine. Recent studies implicate this gene family in a number of aspects in parasite biology and induction of protective immune response. This review summarizes the current understanding on this important gene family in several Plasmodium species. The Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)-sera family, for example, consists of nine gene members. Unlike other multigene families in Plasmodium species, Pf-sera genes do not exhibit antigenic variation. Pf-sera5 nucleotide diversity is also low. Moreover, although Pf-sera5 is highly transcribed during the blood stage of malaria infection, and a large amount is released into the host blood following schizont rupture, in malaria endemic countries the sero-positive rates for Pf-SERA5 are low, likely due to Pf-SERA5 binding of host proteins to avoid immune recognition. As an antigen, the N-terminal 47 kDa domain of Pf-SERA5 is a promising vaccine candidate currently undergoing clinical trials. Pf-SERA5 and Pf-SERA6, as well as P. berghei (Pb)-SERA3, and Pb-SERA5, have been investigated for their roles in parasite egress. Two P. yoelii SERA, which have a serine residue at the protease active center, are implicated in parasite virulence. Overall, these studies provide insight that during the evolution of the Plasmodium parasite, the sera gene family members have increased by gene duplication, and acquired various functions that enable the parasite to survive and successfully maintain infection in the host.

In all but one of the lymphomas studied, the tumour cells were unreactive with the mAb HML-1. The HML-1(+) lymphoma was the only tumour that was primarily localised in the epithelium and lamina propria of the small intestine, and was associated with ulcerative jejunitis and coeliac disease. This result suggests that the HML-1(+) lymphoma was derived from intestinal mucosa T lymphocytes and differs from precursor T cell lymphoblastic lymphomas and nodal and cutaneous peripheral T cell lymphomas.","Stein, H.; Sperling, M.; Dienemann, D.; Zeitz, M.; Riecken, E.-O.",Lancet,403,1

Background Research on nurses’ absenteeism has often relied on self‐reports of absence. However, nurses may not be aware of their actual absenteeism, or they may underestimate it. Method Self‐reported absence from questionnaires completed by 215 Canadian nurses was compared with their absence from organizational records. Results There is a strong positive correlation, a strong intra‐class correlation and Cronbach’s alpha for the two measures of absence. However, there is a difference in central tendency that is related to the majority of nurses in this study (51.1%) underestimating their days absent from work. Conclusions Research examining the predictors of absence may consider measuring absence with self‐reports. Nevertheless, nurses demonstrated a bias to underestimate their absence. Implications for nursing management Feedback interventions to reduce absenteeism can be developed to include providing nurses with accurate information about their absence.","GAUDINE, ALICE; GREGORY, CONNIE",J Nurs Manag,403,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten normal subjects were imaged with either 0.1 mmol/kg (N = 5) or 0.2 mmol/kg (N = 5) of Gd‐DTPA‐BMA contrast agent at 1.5T and 3T. T(1) measurements of blood and myocardium were performed prior to contrast injection and every five minutes for 35 minutes following contrast injection at both field strengths. Measurements of biodistribution were calculated from the ratio of ΔR(1) (ΔR (1myo)/ΔR (1blood)). RESULTS: Precontrast blood T(1) values (mean ± SD, N = 10) did not significantly differ between 1.5T and 3T (1.58 ± .13 sec, and 1.66 ± .06 sec, respectively; P > 0.05), but myocardium T(1) values were significantly different (1.07 ± .03 sec and 1.22 ± .07 sec, respectively; P < 0.05). The field‐dependent difference in myocardium T(1) postinjection (T(1)@3T – T(1)@1.5T) decreased by approximately 72% relative to precontrast T(1) values, while the field‐dependent difference of blood T(1) decreased only 30% postcontrast. Measurements of ΔR (1myo)/ΔR (1blood) were constant for 35 minutes postcontrast, but changed between 1.5T and 3T (0.46 ± .06 vs. 0.54 ± .06, P < 0.10). CONCLUSION: T(1) is significantly longer for myocardium (but not blood) at 3T compared to 1.5T. The differences in T(1) due to field strength are reduced following contrast administration, which may be attributed to changes in ΔR (1myo)/ΔR (1blood) with field strength. J. Magn. Reson.

Clinically, ribavirin has been used effectively in persons primarily to treat life‐threatening viral diseases such as acute haemorrhagic fever or viral pneumonia of infants. In order to evaluate the feasibility of using this antiviral agent in cats, the effects of oral (p.o.), intramuscular (i.m.) and intravenous (i.v.) doses of ribavirin in 27 9‐month‐old specific‐pathogen‐free cats were evaluated by haematology, clinical chemistries, bone marrow biopsies and histopathology. Ribavirin was administered once daily for 10 consecutive days at a dose of either 11, 22, or 44 mg/kg after which all cats were euthanatized and necropsied. Most cats receiving 22 or 44 mg of ribavirin/kg became anorectic and suffered some degree of weight loss (0.2 to 0.6 kg), and about one‐third of the cats developed diarrhoea and/or mucous membrane pallor. Icterus or haemorrhage was not observed. The most profound and consistent haemato‐logic change, particularly among the moderate and high dosage groups regardless of route of administration, was a significant and severe thrombocytopenia (range, 33–78% reduction in mean platelet counts vs. baseline). Other changes, particularly reductions in total WBC and neutrophils and reductions in RBC and PCV, tended to occur at lower ribavirin dosages, but generally they were not statistically significant. Cats given 44 mg of ribavirin/kg i.v. showed significant decreases in leukocyte variables, including total WBC (P = 0.016), neutrophils (P= 0.026) and lymphocytes (P= 0.047). Mild‐to‐moderate increases in serum alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities occurred at doses of 22 and 44 mg/kg. Evaluation of bone marrow biopsies before and after treatment revealed that cats given 11 mg of ribavirin/kg had mild megakaryocytic (MK) hypoplasia, whereas cats receiving 22 or 44 mg/kg had progressively severe degrees of MK hypoplasia and dysplasia, asynchronous MK maturation, and increased myeloidrerythroid ratio. Pathologic changes in ribavirin‐treated cats generally were mild and included primarily enteritis (seven cats) and hepatocellular vacuolation and/or centrilobular necrosis (seven cats). Results of this study in cats indicated that daily administration of ribavirin at a dose range of 11 to 44 mg/kg induced a dose‐related toxic effect on bone marrow, primarily on megakaryocytes and erythroid precursors, and at the higher dosages it suppressed numbers of circulating leukocytes.","WEISS, R.

The highly metabolically active cells of the renal tubule also pair their energetic needs to the regulation of diverse cellular processes, including energy generation, antioxidant responses, autophagy and mitochondrial quality control. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) is essential not only for the harvesting of energy from substrates but also for an array of regulatory reactions that determine cellular health. In acute kidney injury (AKI), substantial decreases in the levels of NAD(+) impair energy generation and, ultimately, the core kidney function of selective solute transport. Conversely, augmentation of NAD(+) may protect the kidney tubule against diverse acute stressors. For example, NAD(+) augmentation can ameliorate experimental AKI triggered by ischaemia–reperfusion, toxic injury and systemic inflammation. NAD(+)-dependent maintenance of renal tubular metabolic health may also attenuate long-term profibrotic responses that could lead to chronic kidney disease. Further understanding of the genetic, environmental and nutritional factors that influence NAD(+) biosynthesis and renal resilience may lead to novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of kidney disease.","Ralto, Kenneth M.; Rhee, Eugene P.; Parikh, Samir M.",Nat Rev Nephrol,403,1

Yet most experimental host-pathogen studies employ single species models of infection. Here, the influence of three-species oral microbial consortium on growth, virulence, invasion and persistence in dendritic cells (DCs) was examined experimentally in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and in patients with periodontitis (PD). Cooperative biofilm formation by Streptococcus gordonii, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis was documented in vitro using growth models and scanning electron microscopy. Analysis of growth rates by species-specific 16s rRNA probes revealed distinct, early advantages to consortium growth for S. gordonii and F. nucleatum with P. gingivalis, while P. gingivalis upregulated its short mfa1 fimbriae, leading to increased invasion of DCs. F. nucleatum was only taken up by DCs when in consortium with P. gingivalis. Mature consortium regressed DC maturation upon uptake, as determined by flow cytometry. Analysis of dental plaques of PD and healthy subjects by 16s rRNA confirmed oral colonization with consortium members, but DC hematogenous spread was limited to P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum. Expression of P. gingivalis mfa1 fimbriae was increased in dental plaques and hematogenous DCs of PD patients. P. gingivalis in the consortium correlated with an adverse clinical response in the gingiva of PD subjects.

We propose an alternative strategy in achieving goals in individuals with an SCI with concomitant injuries that preclude weight bearing below the knee. CASE PRESENTATION: A 16-year-old girl sustained a burst fracture of L1 in conjunction with bilateral ankle fractures. During rehabilitation, the calcaneal fracture on the left and tibial plafond fracture on the right prevented her progression in conventional rehabilitation. An alternative strategy “K-ing” (Kneel Standing/Kneel Walking) was adopted to facilitate truncal activation without loading the ankle joints. This was found to be helpful in obtaining upright posture stability without hampering her recovery of associated ankle injuries. DISCUSSION: “K-ing” strategy can be useful and presents a simple alternative in the presence of associated ankle injuries. It also avoids complications associated with bedrest when there is delay in initiation of ambulation.","Jagadevan, Mohanakrishnan; Mohanakrishnan, Bhanumathy; Murugesan, Salaja; Sharma, Deep; Agarwal, Navin Kumar; Fletcher, Jebaraj; Balasubramanian, Vengatesan",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,403,0

OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate treatment of pressure injury (PI) in patients with spinal cord injuries (SCI) and analyse costs using the “modified Basel Decubitus Concept”. SETTING: Inpatient setting of a specialised acute care and rehabilitation clinic for SCI. METHODS: Complex treatment courses of four patients with chronic SCI and PI stage III or IV were described and costs were recorded. The total healthcare services’ costs per patient and different profession’s involvement were analysed in relation to patient characteristics, treatment phases and milestones demonstrated. RESULTS: The treatment of PI stage III and IV in patients with SCI included input from plastic surgery, rehabilitation medicine, nursing and other involved professions. Recommended interventions were chosen according to the “modified Basel Decubitus Concept”. The cost course of PI treatment in patients with SCI depicted the multimodal treatment concept, including three clinically and financially relevant milestones (debridement, flap surgery and mobilisation to wheelchair) as well as the highest costs in the functionally highly dependent patient. Acute care and rehabilitation overlapped with different intensities during the whole treatment process. CONCLUSION: Multimodal treatment concepts connecting acute and rehabilitation care were applied in these complex health conditions. Cost-explication models including treatment phases and milestones helped to understand resources more easily and integrate aspects of process-based management and quality of care.

OBJECTIVES: The objetive of this study is to compare the effectiveness and usability of alternative commercial abdominal compression garments with participants’ usual medical binders. SETTING: Private residences in Pierce and King Counties, WA, USA. METHODS: Participants wore each garment for 5 days followed by a 2-day washout in personal binder. Week 1: Personal binder. Weeks 2 and 3: Randomly ordered test garments (tank, bodysuit). Physiologic measurements: blood pressure (SBP, DBP), blood oxygen saturation (SaO(2)), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), and heart rate (HR). Participants completed logs twice daily for 5 days per garment regarding ease of use, comfort, respiration, and appearance. We certify that all applicable institutional and governmental regulations concerning the ethical use of human volunteers were followed during the course of this research. RESULTS: The use of a personal binder results in significant increases in SBP and FEV(1). Personal binders support FEV(1) significantly better than test garments. There is no difference in SBP between test garments and personal binders. There are no significant differences between DBP, SaO(2), or HR between participants’ personal binders and no binder. Participants reported that neither tank nor bodysuit felt adequately supportive or easy to use.

CONCLUSIONS: Variation in the clinical management of respiratory impairments and oropharyngeal dysphagia between specialised and non-specialised units have implications for patient outcomes and increase the risk of respiratory complications that impact mortality. The future development of clinical guidance is required to ensure best practice and consistent care across all units.","McRae, Jackie; Smith, Christina; Beeke, Suzanne; Emmanuel, Anton",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,403,1

Recent studies have suggested that UTX mutations promote MDS and AML by blocking the differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Here, we performed an epigenetic drug library screening for small molecules able to release the differentiation block on HSPCs induced by UTX deficiency. We found that SP2509, a selective inhibitor of LSD1, specifically promoted the differentiation of Utx-null HSPCs while sparing wild-type HSPCs. Transcriptome profiling showed that Utx loss reduced the expression of differentiation-related and tumor suppressor genes, correlating with their potential roles in HSPC self-renewal and leukemogenesis. In contrast, SP2509 treatment reversed these changes in gene expression in Utx-null HSPCs. Accordingly, Utx loss decreased H3K4 methylation level probably through the COMPASS-like complex, while LSD1 inhibition by SP2509 partially reversed the reduction of H3K4 methylation in Utx-deficient HSPCs. Further, SP2509 promoted the differentiation of Utx-null AML cells in vitro and in vivo and, therefore, extended the survival of these leukemic mice. Thus, our study identified a novel strategy to specifically target both premalignant and malignant cells with Utx deficiency for differentiation therapy and provided insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of Utx in regulating HSPCs and related diseases.","Wu, Baohong; Pan, Xiangyu; Chen, Xuelan; Chen, Mei; Shi, Kaidou; Xu, Jing; Zheng, Jianan; Niu, Ting; Chen, Chong; Shuai, Xiao; Liu, Yu",Signal Transduct Target Ther,403,12

Bacterial persistence in the gut is responsible for infection relapse; sporulation and other unidentified mechanisms contribute to this process. Intestinal bile salts cholate and deoxycholate stimulate spore germination, while deoxycholate kills vegetative cells. Here, we report that sub-lethal concentrations of deoxycholate stimulate biofilm formation, which protects C. difficile from antimicrobial compounds. The biofilm matrix is composed of extracellular DNA and proteinaceous factors that promote biofilm stability. Transcriptomic analysis indicates that deoxycholate induces metabolic pathways and cell envelope reorganization, and represses toxin and spore production. In support of the transcriptomic analysis, we show that global metabolic regulators and an uncharacterized lipoprotein contribute to deoxycholate-induced biofilm formation. Finally, Clostridium scindens enhances biofilm formation of C. difficile by converting cholate into deoxycholate. Together, our results suggest that deoxycholate is an intestinal signal that induces C. difficile persistence and may increase the risk of relapse.","Dubois, Thomas; Tremblay, Yannick D.

VO caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) such as Mycobacterium abscessus (M. abscesscus) is exceedingly rare with only eight cases reported in literature. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a rare case of an 82-year-old male with a remote history of trauma who was diagnosed with NTM vertebral osteomyelitis. The patient initially underwent a vertebroplasty of T12 and kyphoplasty of L1 for pathologic compression fractures. Subsequent cultures revealed M. abscessus. The patient further underwent an anterior T12-L2 corpectomy and debridement with instrumented fusion, as well as a posterior T9-L4 instrumentation and fusion. He received multi-agent antibiotic therapy; however, was ultimately unable to tolerate the aggressive treatment regimen and his prolonged postoperative course. DISCUSSION: Nontuberculous mycobacteria vertebral osteomyelitis is exceedingly rare. NTM vertebral osteomyelitis is challenging to treat. Surgical management plays a limited role in early VO, but is the mainstay treatment in chronic VO. Early recognition of the condition and shared patient management with multidisciplinary teams is key to successfully treating cases of NTM VO.","Moral, Muhammad Z.; Desai, Khusboo; Arain, Abdul R.; O’Leary, Robert E.; Haddad, Stefanos F.; Lawrence, James P.",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,403,1

OBJECTIVES: To gauge spinal cord injury (SCI) specialists’ assessment of their communications with general practitioners (GPs). To determine whether economic or health-care system-related factors enhance or inhibit such communication. SETTING: A collaboration of co-authors from a health-care system. METHODS: An online survey interrogating a number of aspects of communication between SCI specialists and GPs was developed, distributed, and made available for 4 months. Responses were analyzed for the entire cohort then according to descriptions of participants’ home nations’ economies and the type of health-care delivery systems in which they work. RESULTS: A total of 88 responses were submitted. The majority (64%) were from nations with developed economies, a plurality (47.1%) were from countries that offer universal health coverage, and half used a combination of paper and electronic health records. A majority of respondents (61.8%) reported routinely communicating with their patients’ GPs, but most (53.4%) rated those communications as only “fair”. The most commonly listed barriers to communication with GPs were lack of time (46.3%) and a perceived lack of receptivity by GPs (26.9%). Nearly all respondents (91.6%) believed that the care they provide would be enhanced by improved communication with GPs. Participants who used electronic means of communication were more likely to communicate with GPs and to describe those interactions as “positive”. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are a number of barriers to communication between SCI specialists and GPs, most SCI specialists are eager for such inter-physician communication and believe it would enhance their care they deliver.","Stillman, Michael; Gustafson, Kristin; Fried, Guy W.; Fried, Karen; Williams, Steve R.",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,403,1

Isolated anomalies of the posterior arch of the axis rarely occur. This study reports a unique case of congenital anomaly of the neural arch of the axis vertebra, which manifested clinically as progressive hemiparesis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old man presented with progressive weakness of the right upper and lower limbs that had lasted 18 months. The patient reported loss of right-hand dexterity in the 6 months period before he consulted us. Plain radiographs, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed C5–C6 block vertebra, primary canal stenosis and spino-laminar anomaly of the axis, along with invagination of the lamina into the canal causing severe cord compression. DISCUSSION: The anomalous posterior element of the axis was excised, and the cord was decompressed. The presence of congenital stenosis and block vertebrae at the C5–C6 level necessitated decompression and instrumentation between C2–C6. Simultaneous occurrence of a posterior arch anomaly, primary canal stenosis, and block vertebra has not been previously described. A cervical spine anomaly presenting as hemiparesis is uncommon in clinical practice. Information enabling clinicians to identify causative anomaly and determine the appropriate surgical intervention is useful, and can facilitate a good clinical outcome.","K.

However, risk of complications such as vascular injuries remains. We report a unique case of an intercostal artery (ICA) hemorrhage with hemothorax following LLIF. CASE PRESENTATION: One hour after a right-sided LLIF L3-4 with posterior decompression L2-4 and L3-5 instrumentation, the patient became hypotensive, anemic and required vasopressor support. Evaluation revealed a right-sided hemothorax, which was caused by a bleeding intercostal artery, laterally at the 10th intercostal space. A lateral thoracotomy was performed to stop the bleeding. After vessel ligation and placement of two chest tubes, the patients’ hemodynamics improved. The patient remained intubated overnight and was extubated on the first postoperative day. DISCUSSION: Vascular injury is a rare complication of LLIF procedures. Most vascular injuries are segmental vessel lacerations, which resolve postoperatively. This is the first case description of ICA bleeding associated with LLIF surgery. Spontaneous ICA bleeding exists, but surgeons should be aware of careful handling in patients with vascular risk factors, especially with regard to patient positioning required in certain spinal surgical approaches.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the construct validity and the ability to detect change, of the Italian version of the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) in a spinal cord injury (SCI) population. SETTINGS: Rehabilitation service of the Paraplegic Center of Ostia, Italy. METHODS: Thirty-nine spinal cord injury participants were recruited. The clinimetric properties of the measure were assessed following international guidelines. Cronbach’s alpha and the intraclass correlation coefficient were assessed for internal consistency and test-retest reliability, respectively. Construct validity was evaluated, by calculating correlation between COPM and the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) through Pearson’s correlation coefficient and Spearman’s Rho. The ability to detect change was evaluated on the overall sample. RESULTS: The COPM was shown to be reliable in a spinal cord injury sample with positive and statistically significant results for Cronbach’s alpha (0.89) and ICC (0.99 for the performance subtest and 0.98 for the satisfaction subtest). Correlation coefficients did not show a correlation between the COPM total score and the SCIM. The COPM scores improved significantly during in-patient rehabilitation, moreover the mean change between the start of treatment and the end of the therapy as evaluated with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was −4.25 points for the performance score and −2.96 points for the satisfaction score. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the COPM is a reliable tool for assessing SCI clients’ perceived performance of daily activities and their satisfaction with their performance.","Berardi, Anna; Galeoto, Giovanni; Guarino, Domenico; Marquez, Maria Auxiliadora; De Santis, Rita; Valente, Donatella; Caporale, Giulia; Tofani, Marco",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,403,0

This molecule significantly suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in SKOV3 cell lines as detected by CCK-8 cell proliferation assays and flow cytometry. A Matrigel endothelial tube formation assay showed that SKLB325 inhibited capillary tube organization and migration in HUVECs in vitro. We also observed that JMJD6 colocalized with p53 protein in the nucleus, with mRNA and protein expression of p53 as well as its downstream effectors significantly increasing both in vitro and in intraperitoneal tumor tissues treated with SKLB325.

Unfortunately, primary and acquired resistance limits their clinical benefits. To overcome such resistance, new generations of EGFR TKIs have been developed by targeting newly identified mutations in EGFR. However, much less effort has been put into alternative strategies, such as targeting the intrinsic protective responses to EGFR TKIs. In this study, we found that EGFR TKIs, including gefitinib and AZD9291, impaired lysosome-dependent degradation of SQSTM1, thus compromising their anti-cancer efficiency. By accumulating in the lysosome lumen, gefitinib and AZD9291 attenuated lysosomal acidification and impaired autolysosomal degradation of SQSTM1 owing to their intrinsic alkalinity. As a result, SQSTM1 protein was stabilized in response to gefitinib and AZD9291 treatment and conferred EGFR TKI resistance. Depleting SQSTM1 significantly increased the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to gefitinib and AZD9291 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, a chemically modified gefitinib analog lacking alkalinity displayed stronger inhibitory effects on NSCLC cells. Therefore, targeting accumulated SQSTM1 or chemically modified EGFR TKIs may represent new strategies to increase the effectiveness of EGFR targeted therapy.","Yang, Lixian; Ying, Shilong; Hu, Shiman; Zhao, Xiangtong; Li, Muchun; Chen, Miaoqin; Zhu, Yiran; Song, Ping; Zhu, Liyuan; Jiang, Tingting; An, Huimin; Yousafzai, Neelum Aziz; Xu, Wenxia; Zhang, Zhiguo; Wang, Xian; Feng, Lifeng; Jin, Hongchuan",Signal Transduct Target Ther,403,1

Direct decompression through anterior approaches is associated with approach-related complications, whereas anterior decompression through posterior approaches is technically demanding and may result in neurological deterioration. We present a simple and effective surgical technique of indirect decompression through lordotic rod contouring to reduce such complications. CASE PRESENTATION: Patients who presented to our center between March 2016 and March 2017 with symptoms and signs suggestive of thoracic myelopathy predominantly due to anterior pathologies such as ossification of the thoracic posterior longitudinal ligament, posterior bony spur, and thoracic disc herniation were evaluated in our study. The indications for surgical treatment were progressive neurological impairment and severe myelopathy (grade III or more on Nurick grade). Only those patients classified as grade III and above on American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status scale were included in the study. All the cases were operated by a single surgeon by a posterior-only approach. We have used this technique in four patients with thoracic myelopathy due to combined or predominant anterior pathology. Postoperative imaging confirmed adequate decompression of the spinal cord. All the cases improved substantially in terms of clinical outcome. DISCUSSION: This surgical technique could be a useful alternative to direct anterior decompression in patients who present with symptoms of progressive severe myelopathy due to anterior compression and could be the standard of care in those at high risk for major surgery.","Kalidindi, Kalyan Kumar Varma; Chhabra, Harvinder Singh; Rafiq Bhat, Mohd; Sath, Sulaiman; Mannem, Abhishek",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,403,1

Nanomedicines address the shortcomings of conventional therapy, as evidenced by several preclinical and clinical investigations indicating site-specific drug delivery, reduced side effects, and better treatment outcome. The development of suitable and biocompatible drug delivery vehicles is a prerequisite that has been successfully achieved by using simple and functionalized liposomes, nanoparticles, hydrogels, micelles, dendrimers, and mesoporous particles. A variety of drug delivery vehicles have been established for the targeted and controlled delivery of therapeutic agents in a wide range of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, atherosclerosis, myocardial ischemia, asthma, pulmonary tuberculosis, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. After successful outcomes in preclinical and clinical trials, many of these drugs have been marketed for human use, such as Abraxane®, Caelyx®, Mepact®, Myocet®, Emend®, and Rapamune®. Apart from drugs/compounds, novel therapeutic agents, such as peptides, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), and genes have also shown potential to be used as nanomedicines for the treatment of several chronic ailments.

Using the AI-assisted reading model, reviewers in both the groups exhibited increased lesion detection rates compared to those achieved using the conventional reading model (experts; 34.3%–73.0%; p = 0.029, trainees; 24.7%–53.1%; p = 0.029). The improved result for trainees was comparable to that for the experts (p = 0.057). Further, the AI-assisted reading model significantly shortened the reading time for trainees (1621.0–746.8 min; p = 0.029). Thus, we have developed an AI-assisted reading model that can detect various lesions and can successfully summarize CE images according to clinical significance. The assistance rendered by AI can increase the lesion detection rates of reviewers. Especially, trainees could improve their efficiency of reading as a result of reduced reading time using the AI-assisted model.","Park, Junseok; Hwang, Youngbae; Nam, Ji Hyung; Oh, Dong Jun; Kim, Ki Bae; Song, Hyun Joo; Kim, Su Hwan; Kang, Sun Hyung; Jung, Min Kyu; Jeong Lim, Yun",PLoS One,403,1

However, how non-enveloped viruses hijack cell machinery to promote non-lytic release in EVs, and their functional roles, remain to be clarified. Here we used Bluetongue virus (BTV) as a model of a non-enveloped arthropod-borne virus and discovered that the majority of viruses are released in EVs. Based on the cellular proteins detected in these EVs, and use of inhibitors targeting the cellular degradation process, we demonstrated that these extracellular vesicles are derived from secretory lysosomes, in which the acidic pH is neutralized upon the infection. Moreover, we report that secreted EVs are more efficient than free-viruses for initiating infections, but that they trigger super-infection exclusion that only free-viruses can overcome.","Labadie, Thomas; Roy, Polly",PLoS Pathog,403,1

Previously, we have shown that cannabinoid exposure via lactation during the early postnatal period disrupts early developmental trajectories of prefrontal cortex maturation and induces behavioral abnormalities during the first weeks of life in male and female rat progeny. Here, we investigated the lasting consequences of this postnatal cannabinoid exposure on synaptic and behavioral parameters in the adult offspring of ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-treated dams. At adulthood, these perinatally THC-exposed rats exhibits deficits in social discrimination accompanied by an overall augmentation of social exploratory behavior. These behavioral alterations were further correlated with multiple abnormalities in synaptic plasticity in the prefrontal cortex, including lost endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression (LTD), lost long-term potentiation and augmented mGlu2/3-LTD. Finally, basic parameters of intrinsic excitability at prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons were similarly altered by the perinatal THC exposure. Thus, perinatal THC exposure via lactation induces lasting deficits in behavior and synaptic function which persist into adulthood life in male and female progeny.","Scheyer, Andrew F.; Borsoi, Milene; Pelissier- Alicot, Anne-Laure; Manzoni, Olivier J.

With advances in medical care, more patients are surviving an initial stay in critical care; however, they can experience ongoing health and cognitive limitations that may influence return to baseline function up to a year post-admission. Recent research has focused on the introduction of early rehabilitation within the ICU to reduce long-term physical and cognitive complications. The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility and impact of providing early enhanced occupation-based therapy, including cognitive stimulation and activities of daily living, to patients in intensive care. METHODS: This study involves a single site randomised-controlled feasibility trial comparing standard occupational therapy care to an early enhanced occupation-based therapy. Thirty mechanically ventilated ICU patients will be recruited and randomly allocated to the intervention or control group. The primary outcome measure is the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and secondary measures include the Modified Barthel Index (MBI), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), grip strength, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Short-Form 36 Health survey (SF-36). Measures will be collected by a blind assessor at discharge from intensive care, hospital discharge and a 90-day follow-up. Daily outcome measures including the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) and Confusion Assessment Measure for intensive care units (CAM-ICU) will be taken prior to treatment. Participants in the intervention group will receive daily a maximum of up to 60-min sessions with an occupational therapist involving cognitive and functional activities such as self-care and grooming. At the follow-up, intervention group participants will be interviewed to gain user perspectives of the intervention. Feasibility data including recruitment and retention rates will be summarised descriptively. Parametric tests will compare outcomes between groups. Interview data will be thematically analysed. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide information about the feasibility of investigating how occupational therapy interventions in ICU influence longer term outcomes. It seeks to inform the design of a phase III multicentre trial of occupational therapy in critical care general medical intensive care units.

This attractive feature of poly‐L‐lysine makes it very convenient for bioactive molecule attachment. This study details the preparation of poly‐L‐lysine‐based pencil graphite electrodes (PLL/PGEs) and use of the coated electrodes for direct ultrasensitive DNA hybridization detection. In the first part of this study, poly‐L‐lysine coated electrodes were prepared using L‐lysine as the monomer by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with different cyclic scans. The effect of these cyclic scans during the electropolymerization was investigated. Coated electrodes were characterized by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Then, one‐pot preparation of poly‐L‐lysine composites with graphene (GN) and multi‐walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) onto the pencil graphite electrodes were achieved. Electrochemical responses of these 3 electrodes were compared. After all, electrochemical DNA hybridization was performed using the poly‐L‐lysine‐based electrodes prepared at optimum polymerization condition. The PLL/PGE coated electrode presented a good linear response in the target concentration range of 1.0×10(−13) to 1.0×10(−6) with a detection limit of 2.25×10(−14) using differential pulse voltammetry as the detection method. We believe that poly‐L‐lysine‐based surfaces will be useful for further clinical applications.","Kuralay, Filiz; Dükar, Nilgün; Bayramlı, Yaşar",Electroanalysis,403,1

The habitat requirements of a species are the resources, conditions and space required for survival and reproduction. The habitat requirements of butterflies have been well studied, but the extent to which individuals within a species and between species utilise and share the habitat is poorly known. 2. In a butterfly assemblage in northern Italy, we found that adults from 30 species avoid deciduous high‐density forests and their ecotones, and they were positively related to open areas and their ecotones. Besides these common features, five groups of species can be discriminated in relation to a gradient from open area to forest, and species within groups were not equally specialised, as observed from a bipartite network analysis. In particular, some species appeared to be specialised and others appeared to be generalist, suggesting a nested pattern of resource use, rather than a clustered pattern in which each species uses a different subset of habitat types. 3. The degree of variation in specialisation among species varied with the number of species falling in each group. Thus, an increased number of species, and thus possibly competition, is more likely to promote the co‐occurrence of generalist and specialised species (nested patterns) rather than an increased niche segregation among species. 4. Ascertaining how species overlap their habitat use at a local scale can be relevant for conservation purposes, because specialised populations are potentially more susceptible to network distortions.","Trivellini, Guido; Polidori, Carlo; Pasquaretta, Cristian; Orsenigo, Simone; Bogliani, Giuseppe",Insect Conserv Divers,403,1

METHODS: A patient developed COVID-19 during chemotherapy for glioma. We retrospectively identified others diagnosed with COVID-19 during temozolomide or lomustine for glioma. RESULTS: (1) A 64 year-old woman (index patient) with anaplastic oligodendroglioma received PCV 22 months previously. Baseline White Blood Cell (WBC) count was 4.2 and Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) was 2.7 K/uL. KPS was 90 without comorbidities. For recurrence she initiated temozolomide but developed fever on cycle 1 day 2. SARS-COV-2 PCR was positive. Further temozolomide was held. She is recovering as an outpatient. (2) A 27 year-old man with anaplastic astrocytoma received concurrent RT/temozolomide then 1 cycle of adjuvant temozolomide. Baseline WBC was 8.3, ANC 5.2, and KPS 90. Obesity, asthma, and pre-diabetes were comorbidities. Hyposmia/hypogeusia and low-grade fever began, in retrospect, during concurrent RT/temozolomide. PCR for SARS-COV-2 was negative 2 months after symptom onset; serology detected both IgG and IgM when WBC was 6.6 and ANC 4.0. Cycle 2 of adjuvant temozolomide was held until fever resolved (spontaneously); hyposmia/hypogeusia persist. (3) A 53 year-old man with glioblastoma previously received RT/temozolomide, then lomustine and bevacizumab for progression. WBC was 5.1, ANC 4.0, and KPS 60. He was obese. Fever, chills, and dyspnea developed on lomustine cycle 2 day 38. SARS-COV-2 PCR was positive. He was hospitalized and chemotherapy held; symptoms resolved 12 days after onset, but PCR continued to show detectable virus 32 days later. PCR became negative after 50 days total, and treatment resumed uneventfully. DISCUSSION: All 3 patients recovered from SARS-COV-2 infection despite active temozolomide or lomustine chemotherapy. Normal ANC, high KPS, and early detection may have contributed to limited symptom severity and duration, despite obesity and other comorbidities in 2 cases. Detection changed management by delaying additional cycles of immunosuppressive chemotherapy until recovery.","Kim, Esther; Koshy, Amily; Higgins, Shannon; Lassman, Andrew; Iwamoto, Fabio",Neuro Oncol,403,0

In the race to mitigate these effects, the UK government has committed to net-zero emissions by 2050. Transport provides the largest single sector contribution to CO(2) emissions, the road network accounts for up to 91%. As the only UK country without a formal climate change bill Northern Ireland could compromise the overall effort. CASE DESCRIPTION: In this research a survey of road asset owners, managers, academics, consultants, public transport providers was undertaken to seek to understand the current barriers to adapting a dispersed rural road network in Northern Ireland for net-zero transport. The survey data was collected though an online form with a combination of multiple choice and open ended questions. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyse the data collected which enabled a discussion around the key expert opinions gathered. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: The paper presents details of the current road network in Northern Ireland and highlights some of the issues faced by asset owners. The survey questions were developed though engagement with transport professionals in Northern Ireland and focus predominantly on road use rather than the impact of current land management practices or environmental conditions such as flood risk. The response highlights a clear enthusiasm for change in the operation of the public road network which is hindered by a lack of government strategy and limited public consultation. CONCLUSIONS: The high response rate (41%) for the survey highlights the interest of those in the transport sector to engage in activities which can support a better understanding of how road networks contribute to CO(2) emissions. Within the survey data a requirement for behavioural change was highlighted as a key step to reduce transport related emissions, the enthusiasm for change demonstrates this is the optimum time to engage with the public and develop clear transport strategies. More accurate findings and empirical evidence could have been established had the study considered specific, transport planning, environmental and land use conditions for Northern Ireland. This will be the focus of further research in this area to enable clear translation of the research to other countries.","Lydon, Myra; Lydon, Darragh; Stevens, Nicola-Ann; Taylor, Su; Early, Juliana; Marshall, Adele",J Infrastruct Preserv Resil,403,0

METHODS In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, we assigned 1697 patients with infection, systemic inflammation, and shock who were receiving fluids and vasopressors above a threshold dose for 4 hours to receive either DrotAA (at a dose of 24 μg per kilogram of body weight per hour) or placebo for 96 hours. The primary outcome was death from any cause 28 days after randomization. RESULTS At 28 days, 223 of 846 patients (26.4%) in the DrotAA group and 202 of 834 (24.2%) in the placebo group had died (relative risk in the DrotAA group, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.28; P=0.31). At 90 days, 287 of 842 patients (34.1%) in the DrotAA group and 269 of 822 (32.7%) in the placebo group had died (relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.19; P=0.56). Among patients with severe protein C deficiency at baseline, 98 of 342 (28.7%) in the DrotAA group had died at 28 days, as compared with 102 of 331 (30.8%) in the placebo group (risk ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.17; P=0.54). Similarly, rates of death at 28 and 90 days were not significantly different in other predefined subgroups, including patients at increased risk for death. Serious bleeding during the treatment period occurred in 10 patients in the DrotAA group and 8 in the placebo group (P=0.81). CONCLUSIONS DrotAA did not significantly reduce mortality at 28 or 90 days, as compared with placebo, in patients with septic shock.

This single-center, longitudinal retrospective cohort study was conducted to validate this criteria. METHODS Present study included the IgAN patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2005 in the Juntendo University Hospital. Remission of hematuria was defined as three consecutive dipstick test results of ( -) to ( ±) or a red blood cell count < 5 in urinary sediment per high-power field during at least 6 months. Remission of proteinuria was defined as three consecutive dipstick results of ( -) to ( ±) during at least 6 months. We categorized four groups according to the remission status which was assessed 2 years after the renal biopsy. The primary outcome was a 50% increase in the serum creatinine over the baseline. We evaluated the slope of eGFR decline (mL/min/1.73 m2/year) and a decrease in the eGFR of 30% from baseline eGFR as the secondary outcome, respectively. RESULTS A total of 74 patients (male: 47.3%, median age: 30 years) were included and were followed for a median of 86.5 months. During the period, forty-one patients achieved neither remission of proteinuria nor hematuria (NR). Twelve patients met the primary study outcome. A survival analysis revealed that the NR had the worst prognosis and the steepest slope of eGFR decline. CONCLUSION Although further validation in a large cohort is necessary, these novel remission criteria for IgAN patients appear to predict the renal prognosis.","Matsuzaki, Keiichi; Suzuki, Hitoshi; Kawamura, Tetsuya; Tomino, Yasuhiko; Suzuki, Yusuke",Clinical and experimental nephrology,403,1

Improving hospital emergency management is an important challenge. OBJECTIVE This is a pilot study intended to assess hospital emergency management in the Beijing area, make recommendations to government health authorities and hospital managers, and offer references for similar studies. METHODS This was an observational, cross-sectional survey. Forty-five hospitals in the Beijing area were selected randomly. A self-administered questionnaire was used as a data collection tool. It comprised of three sections: (1) Section A was the introduction; (2) Section B asked for the respondent's personal information; and (3) Section C comprised the major part of the questionnaire and was intended to gather information regarding the hospital's general emergency management situation. RESULTS The survey response rate was 44%, accounting for 29% of total hospitals that the study targeted. No hospital had an established emergency management department or full-time staff for emergency management. A total of 15-45% of the hospitals had established a hospital emergency management committee, performed a vulnerability analysis, or evaluated emergency management regularly. Twenty-five percent of respondents thought that the local government health authority had established an integrated hospital incident command system. A total of 40%-55% of hospitals contracted with outside institutions for supplements, backup of key functional systems and professional support. CONCLUSIONS After the occurrence of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, Chinese hospital managers took many measures to improve hospital resilience. However, most of these efforts lacked the guidance of theories, concepts, principles, and methods. An integrated, standardized, operational hospital emergency management model has not been established. Although the survey response rate was relatively low, some clues for further study were discovered, and suggestions to the health authority for hospital emergency management improvement were revealed.","Yantao, Xin",Prehospital and disaster medicine,403,24

In spite of its prevalence, FD is associated with major uncertainties in terms of its definition, underlying pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. METHODS A Delphi consensus was initiated with 41 experts from 22 European countries who conducted a literature summary and voting process on 87 statements. Quality of evidence was evaluated using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Consensus (defined as >80% agreement) was reached for 36 statements. RESULTS The panel agreed with the definition in terms of its cardinal symptoms (early satiation, postprandial fullness, epigastric pain, and epigastric burning), its subdivision into epigastric pain syndrome and postprandial distress syndrome, and the presence of accessory symptoms (upper abdominal bloating, nausea, belching), and overlapping conditions. Also, well accepted are the female predominance of FD, its impact on quality of life and health costs, and acute gastrointestinal infections, and anxiety as risk factors. In terms of pathophysiological mechanisms, the consensus supports a role for impaired gastric accommodation, delayed gastric emptying, hypersensitivity to gastric distention, Helicobacter pylori infection, and altered central processing of signals from the gastroduodenal region. There is consensus that endoscopy is mandatory for establishing a firm diagnosis of FD, but that in primary care, patients without alarm symptoms or risk factors can be managed without endoscopy. There is consensus that H. pylori status should be determined in every patient with dyspeptic symptoms and H. pylori positive patients should receive eradication therapy. Also, proton pump inhibitor therapy is considered an effective therapy for FD, but no other treatment approach reached a consensus. The long-term prognosis and life expectancy are favorable. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES A multinational group of European experts summarized the current state of consensus on the definition, diagnosis and management of FD.","Wauters, Lucas; Dickman, Ram; Drug, Vasile; Mulak, Agata; Serra, Jordi; Enck, Paul; Tack, Jan; Accarino, Anna; Barbara, Giovanni; Bor, Serhat; Coffin, Benoit; Corsetti, Maura; De Schepper, Heiko; Dumitrascu, Dan; Farmer, Adam; Gourcerol, Guillaume; Hauser, Goran; Hausken, Trygve; Karamanolis, George; Keszthelyi, Daniel; Malagelada, Carolin; Milosavljevic, Tomislav; Muris, Jean; O'Morain, Colm; Papathanasopoulos, Athanassos; Pohl, Daniel; Rumyantseva, Diana; Sarnelli, Giovanni; Savarino, Edoardo; Schol, Jolien; Sheptulin, Arkady; Smet, Annemieke; Stengel, Andreas; Storonova, Olga; Storr, Martin; Törnblom, Hans; Vanuytsel, Tim; Velosa, Monica; Waluga, Marek; Zarate, Natalia; Zerbib, Frank",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,403,5

Methods and Results Retrospective analysis of the AKI incidence in 1089 consecutive patients receiving CT angiography and mechanical thrombectomy from 2015 to 2017 and in subgroups with CKD (n=99) and CT perfusion (n=104) was performed. Patients received a standardized hydration protocol. Data on kidney function after mechanical thrombectomy were available in 1017 patients. A total of 59 (5.8%) patients developed AKI, and only 4 (6.8%) patients needed hemodialysis, all with known CKD. Patients with AKI significantly more often had known CKD (20.3% versus 8.4%, P=0.002), diabetes mellitus (33.9% versus 20.9%, P=0.018), and tandem occlusion (32.2% versus 16.2%, P=0.003) and a significantly higher in-hospital mortality (20.3% versus 7.0%, P<0.001) compared with patients without AKI. However, there were no significant independent predictors for AKI in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Sex (odds ratio [OR], 2.03; 95% CI, 1.17-3.52 [P=0.012]), higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.14 [P<0.001]), AKI (OR, 3.52; 95% CI, 1.63-7.64 [P=0.001]), diuretic use (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.02-3.19), futile or incomplete recanalization (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.09-0.40 [P<0.001]), and total volume of contrast agent volume (OR, 1.007; 95% CI, 1.002-1.011 [P=0.004]) were independently associated with in-hospital death. Two thirds of the patients with AKI died of severe brain damage and not AKI itself. Conclusions Post-contrast AKI rarely occurs in patients with stroke receiving a contrast agent for CT angiography/CT perfusion and subsequent mechanical thrombectomy. Patients with known CKD had higher rates of AKI and only these patients needed hemodialysis, but CKD was not independently associated with AKI or in-hospital mortality.","Weber, Ralph; van Hal, Robert; Stracke, Paul; Hadisurya, Jeffrie; Nordmeyer, Hannes; Chapot, René",Journal of the American Heart Association,403,1

Diaphragmatic thermal damage is one of the fatal late complications of percutaneous transdiaphragmatic RFA. Our experience with laparoscopic transthoracic transdiaphragmatic intraoperative RFA (LTTI-RFA) for hepatic tumors beneath the diaphragm is reported. METHODS Ten patients who underwent LTTI-RFA from 2009 to 2012 were evaluated. Two cases had concomitant partial hepatectomy, and one underwent RFA for two tumors at the same time. The diagnosis was hepatocellular carcinoma in eight cases and metastatic hepatic tumors in two cases. Nine of eleven tumors were located at segments 7 and 8. Nine tumors were less than 20 mm in diameter. The patients were placed in the half left lateral decubitus position with single-lumen tube intubation. After placement of four abdominal ports, a 12-mm port was inserted in the fourth or fifth intercostal space into the diaphragm. The tumor was ablated by an RFA needle through the port. The routine follow-up consisted of laboratory tests and abdominal imaging every 3-6 months. RESULTS The median operation time for only one tumor was 137 minutes (range, 105-187 minutes). The median number of times for ablation was three. Severe postoperative complications (>Clavien-Dindo IIIa) were observed in one case (right upper limb paralysis). The median follow-up period was 35 months (range, 11-43 months). There was no local tumor progression. Recurrent hepatic tumor appearance occurred in other parts of the liver in 6 of the 11 patients. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic transthoracic transdiaphragmatic RFA is an acceptable procedure with a low rate of local recurrence.","Tanaka, Kimitaka; Kojima, Tetsufumi; Hiraguchi, Etsuo; Hashida, Hideaki; Noji, Takehiro; Hirano, Satoshi",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Four different missense mutations were identified in ten patients from nine families in five different countries, suggesting that this disease could be prevalent in other populations as well. Haplotype analysis of patients with similar ancestry revealed two different founder mutations in Southern Europe and France, indicating that the prevalence in these populations may be higher. In our study all patients presented with highly similar clinical features: adult-onset, usually distal more than proximal limb muscle weakness, slowly progressing over decades with preserved walking. Lower limb muscle imaging showed a characteristic pattern of muscle involvement and fatty degeneration. Histopathological and electron microscopic analysis of patient muscle biopsies revealed myopathic findings with rimmed vacuoles and the presence of sarcoplasmic inclusions, some with amyloid-like characteristics. In silico predictions and subsequent cell culture studies showed that the missense mutations increase aggregation propensity of the SMPX protein. In cell culture studies, overexpressed SMPX localized to stress granules and slowed down their clearance.","Johari, Mridul; Sarparanta, Jaakko; Vihola, Anna; Jonson, Per Harald; Savarese, Marco; Jokela, Manu; Torella, Annalaura; Piluso, Giulio; Said, Edith; Vella, Norbert; Cauchi, Marija; Magot, Armelle; Magri, Francesca; Mauri, Eleonora; Kornblum, Cornelia; Reimann, Jens; Stojkovic, Tanya; Romero, Norma B; Luque, Helena; Huovinen, Sanna; Lahermo, Päivi; Donner, Kati; Comi, Giacomo Pietro; Nigro, Vincenzo; Hackman, Peter; Udd, Bjarne",Acta neuropathologica,403,1

But there have been difficulties in the application of technology-based interventions in mental health. Some quantitative systematic reviews don't allow us to fully identify and properly describe this subject. In order to answer the question ""how do electronic interventions apply in mental health and what makes the application of any of these interventions work"", this study will carry out an overview of systematic reviews, which will make it possible to develop a theoretical framework on the implementation of electronic care in mental health problems. Methods: We will search MEDLINE, EBM Reviews, PsycINFO, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CINAHL Complete, and Web of Science databases from 1st January 2015 to September 2020, with no language restriction. We will follow a qualitative method approach and include systematic reviews that assess primary studies relating to adults with common mental health problems using any type of mobile mental health intervention that includes a synchronic component and communication with a mental health professional. For the analysis, we will make a meta-synthesis of the systematic reviews, using an emergent grounded theory approach to synthesize the information, prioritizing the systematic reviews with the lowest risk of bias in the AMSTAR-2 tool. The meta-synthesis will be based on interpreting, integrating, and inferring the evaluation elements to understand better the e-health implementation process for patients with mental health problems.

Less invasive approaches that potentially lower morbidity deserve consideration, recognizing there are many technical considerations that currently limit their use. We describe a reproducible technique and lessons learned in our laboratory that answer some existing questions with regards to the use of NOTES for hernia repair. METHODS A non-survival porcine model with general anesthesia was utilized in all cases. Each animal underwent transgastric peritoneal access with a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) technique, and the gastrotomy was dilated with a wire-guided balloon dilatation catheter. An Esophageal Z-stent delivery device (Cook Medical, Winston-Salem, NC) was modified ex-vivo to allow us to introduce and protect a 10 x 15 cm lightweight polypropylene hernia prosthetic with pre-placed sutures. Once deployed, the sutures were pulled through the abdominal wall using a looped spinal needle technique in combination with the flexible endoscope. After the four anchoring sutures were tied, proprietary endoscopically placed tacks (Cook Medical) were placed at regular intervals between the sutures to secure the edges of the prosthetic. RESULTS Hernia repairs were performed on five animals. In each case, we successfully completed prosthetic delivery and deployment into the peritoneal cavity, anchoring to the abdominal wall with full-thickness abdominal wall sutures, and endoscopically placed nitinol tacks. All prosthetics were deployed flat against the anterior abdominal wall. Operative times ranged from 65 to 120 min. CONCLUSION Transgastric abdominal wall hernia repair is feasible, consistent, and reproducible. In particular, the delivery system can successfully deliver the prosthetic across the gastric wall via a transoral route. Survival animal experiments investigating outcomes related to quality of repair, microbiology, adhesions, and visceral closure need to be done. Human studies are not recommended until these issues are formally investigated.","Earle, D B; Desilets, D J; Romanelli, J R",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,403,1

A seasonal pattern, particularly if combined with other seasonal outbreaks of respiratory virus infections, may have significant impacts on the healthcare system. We evaluated the seasonal pattern of existing endemic coronaviruses and several other common respiratory viruses to determine the potential impacts of added burden of respiratory disease should SARS-CoV-2 establish seasonality. Methods National surveillance data for laboratory confirmations of endemic coronaviruses, influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus for the past 10 years were obtained from the Government of Canada Open Data and FluWatch. Epidemic curves were generated from total case numbers and percent of samples testing positive for each respiratory virus by epidemiological week. Results In Canada, endemic coronaviruses and other common respiratory viruses cause annual seasonal outbreaks in the winter months. Should SARS-CoV-2 develop a seasonal pattern similar to endemic coronaviruses and respiratory viruses, co-circulation would be expected to peak between January and March. Peak endemic coronavirus activity occurs during the nadir of rhinovirus/enterovirus and parainfluenza activity. Conclusion Healthcare settings, assisted-living and long-term care homes, schools and essential services employers should anticipate and have contingencies for seasonal outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 and co-circulating respiratory viruses during peak seasons. Given the likelihood of co-circulation, diagnostic multiplex testing targeting co-circulating pathogens may be more efficient than single target assays for symptomatic individuals if a seasonal pattern to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is established.","Lagacé-Wiens, Philippe; Bullard, Jared; Cole, Roy; Van Caeseele, Paul",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,403,20

Therefore, the use of some criteria has been proposed in order to give more objectivity to the diagnosis process. Two of them are the International Dental Federation (FDI) and the Caries Associated with Restorations and Sealants (CARS) criteria. Both methods have a different approach to caries, and it is not possible to know which one of them is the best to use in clinical practice to assess restorations in children. Thus, the present protocol aims to evaluate the effect of the use of the FDI and CARS criteria in the assessment of caries lesions around restorations in primary teeth on outcomes related to oral health in children and costs resulting from the assessments. Methods and analysis: A total of 626 restorations of children from three to 10 years were randomly assessed and are being treated following the FDI criteria (FDI group) or CARS criteria (CARS group). Participants will be followed-up after six, 12, 18, and 24 months. The primary outcome will be the need for a new intervention in the evaluated restorations. This outcome consists of several components, and each of these events will be analyzed separately as secondary outcomes. The changes in children's oral health-related quality of life and the cost of the restoration dental treatments will also be analyzed as secondary outcomes. The methods will be compared using the Cox regression model with shared frailty. A significance level of 5% will be adopted for all statistical analyses. Discussion: This will be the first randomized clinical study carried out regarding the detection of caries lesions around restorations in primary teeth.

This can lead patients to use the emergency department (ED) as a ready alternative to their usual source of medical care, even when such care could be provided more cost-effectively in a primary care setting. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between ED visits and perceived barriers to receiving timely primary care. METHODS Among 30,677 adults 18 years or older participating in the adult sample section of the National Health Interview Survey, 23,413 who reported having a usual source of medical care other than the ED and answered the questions related to barriers were included in our analyses. Associations between perceived timely access barriers and reported use of ED in the previous 12 months were examined using logistic regression to control for covariates that also affect ED use. RESULTS For those reporting no access barriers, 1 in 5 adult Americans in the noninstitutionalized civilian population visited an ED at least once during the preceding year. For those reporting 1 or more barriers, the proportion having an ED visit was 1 in 3. Four of the 5 following timely access barriers was independently associated with ED use, even after adjusting for other socioeconomic and health-related factors: (1) ""couldn't get through on phone"" (OR [odds ratio], 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.59); (2) ""couldn't get appointment soon enough"" (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.21-1.75); (3) ""waiting too long in doctor's office"" (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02-1.41); (4) ""not open when you could go"" (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.99-1.55); and (5) ""no transportation"" (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.50-2.35). CONCLUSIONS The benefits of having a usual source of medical care are diminished by barriers that limit effective and timely access to such care. Interventions to improve effective access to medical care such as open access scheduling might have benefits not only for individual patients and practices but also for health policy related to cost-effective health care delivery systems and our need to relieve overcrowded conditions at EDs.","Rust, George; Ye, Jiali; Baltrus, Peter; Daniels, Elvan; Adesunloye, Bamidele; Fryer, George Edward",Archives of internal medicine,403,1

The rapid and sensitive detection of respiratory viruses is essential for the early diagnosis and administration of appropriate antiviral therapy, as well as for the effective implementation of infection control measures. We compared the performance of two commercial assays, xTAG RVP Fast (Luminex Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada) and FilmArray RVP (FA RVP; Idaho Technology, Salt Lake City, UT), in pediatric patients at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. These assays detect the following viruses: respiratory syncytial virus; influenza A and B viruses; parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, and 4; human metapneumovirus; adenovirus; enterovirus-rhinovirus; coronaviruses NL63, HKU1, 229E, and OC43; and bocavirus. We tested a total of 358 respiratory specimens from 173 pediatric patients previously tested by direct fluorescence assay (DFA) and viral culture. The overall detection rate (number of positive specimens/total specimens) for viruses tested by all methods was 24% for DFA/culture, 45% for xTAG RVP Fast, and 51% for FA RVP. The agreement between the two multiplex assays was 84.5%, and the difference in detection rate was statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Overall, the FA RVP assay was more sensitive than the xTAG RVP Fast assay and had a turnaround time of approximately 1 h. The sensitivity, simplicity, and random-access platform make FA RVP an excellent choice for laboratory on-demand service with low to medium volume.","Babady, N Esther; Mead, Peter; Stiles, Jeffrey; Brennan, Carrie; Li, Haijing; Shuptar, Susan; Stratton, Charles W; Tang, Yi-Wei; Kamboj, Mini",Journal of clinical microbiology,403,1

This study aimed to investigate the influence of mesh structure on the biological behavior of polypropylene prostheses placed at the hiatus. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-four pigs in three groups of eight underwent implantation of heavyweight small-porous (HW-SP), heavyweight large-porous (HW-LP), or lightweight large-porous (LW-LP) circular polypropylene mesh at the hiatus. Eight weeks later, the meshes were explanted. Macroscopic analysis was performed evaluating mesh deformation, adhesions, and position relative to the hiatal margin. Histological analysis comprised evaluation of foreign body reaction and tissue integration by mononuclear cell count and immunostaining of Ki-67, collagen type I, and collagen type III. RESULTS No mesh-related complications occurred. Mesh shrinkage was observed within all groups and was the lowest for HW-LP, higher for HW-SP, and highest for LW-LP (13.8% versus 19.5% versus 25.5%; P<.001). The adhesion score was highest for HW-SP, lower for HW-LP, and lowest for LW-LP (11.0 versus 8.0 versus 6.0; P<.001). The collagen type I/III ratio was higher for HW-SP compared with HW-LP and LW-LP (3.1 versus 2.2 versus 1.8; P=.014). CONCLUSIONS Heavyweight polypropylene meshes may be advantageous for application at the hiatus. They provide a solid fixation of the esophagogastric junction by adhesions, which may contribute to a reduction of hernia recurrence. In heavyweight meshes, the large-porous structure is associated with superior form stability, and small-porous meshes are superior with regard to solidity of tissue integration, which may prevent mesh migration.","Senft, Jonas; Gehrig, Tobias; Lasitschka, Felix; Linke, Georg R; Shevchenko, Maxym; Bruckner, Thomas; Kenngott, Hannes G; Fischer, Lars; Müller-Stich, Beat P",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

METHODS On January 27, 2020 the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System (NJPIES) agreed to operate the New Jersey Coronavirus Hotline. Call patterns, subject matter, and staffing and infrastructure strategies that were implemented to meet the demand are described. In addition, a sample of 1500 individual calls were collected and analyzed in an endeavor to describe call times, call days, area from which the call originated, callers to the hotline, primary language of the caller, and why a call was placed to the hotline. Binomial regression analysis was utilized in an attempt to identify significant patterns. RESULTS Since the inception of the hotline through October 31, NJPIES responded to 57,579 calls for COVID-19 information. Most calls (68.7%) were regarding testing for COVID-19 and for general questions/symptoms. Call types varied when they were analyzed by time of day with calls for general questions/symptoms and where to get tested for COVID-19 showing a significant association for the early morning hours, how to obtain test results being significantly associated with the afternoon hours, and how to renew or obtain a medical license showing a significant association to the evening hours. We additionally noted that specific call types became significant when analyzed on a week-to-week basis and as specific events, like the enactment of the CARES Act of 2020, occurred. CONCLUSION Although not the traditional role of a regional Poison Control Center, pandemic response synergizes with the workflow of this hotline because the infrastructure, staffing, and healthcare expertise are already present. Poison centers can rapidly adapt through scaling and process change to meet the needs of the public during times of public health threats.","Meaden, Christopher W; Ramdin, Christine; Ruck, Bruce; Nelson, Lewis S; Soukas, Chloe; Hirsch, Mitchell; Alsharif, Peter; Beckford, David; Calello, Diane P",Clinical toxicology,403,1

We compared the effects of prone positioning on regional lung aeration in late versus early stages of lung injury. DESIGN Prospective, longitudinal imaging study. SETTING Research imaging facility at The University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA) and Medical and Surgical ICUs at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA). SUBJECTS Anesthetized swine and patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (acute respiratory distress syndrome). INTERVENTIONS Lung injury was induced by bronchial hydrochloric acid (3.5 mL/kg) in 10 ventilated Yorkshire pigs and worsened by supine nonprotective ventilation for 24 hours. Whole-lung CT was performed 2 hours after hydrochloric acid (Day 1) in both prone and supine positions and repeated at 24 hours (Day 2). Prone and supine images were registered (superimposed) in pairs to measure the effects of positioning on the aeration of each tissue unit. Two patients with early acute respiratory distress syndrome were compared with two patients with late acute respiratory distress syndrome, using electrical impedance tomography to measure the effects of body position on regional lung mechanics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Gas exchange and respiratory mechanics worsened over 24 hours, indicating lung injury progression. On Day 1, prone positioning reinflated 18.9% ± 5.2% of lung mass in the posterior lung regions. On Day 2, position-associated dorsal reinflation was reduced to 7.3% ± 1.5% (p < 0.05 vs Day 1). Prone positioning decreased aeration in the anterior lungs on both days. Although prone positioning improved posterior lung compliance in the early acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, it had no effect in late acute respiratory distress syndrome subjects. CONCLUSIONS The effects of prone positioning on lung aeration may depend on the stage of lung injury and duration of prior ventilation; this may limit the clinical efficacy of this treatment if applied late.","Xin, Yi; Martin, Kevin; Morais, Caio C A; Delvecchio, Paolo; Gerard, Sarah E; Hamedani, Hooman; Herrmann, Jacob; Abate, Nicholas; Lenart, Austin; Humayun, Shiraz; Sidhu, Uday; Petrov, Mihail; Reutlinger, Kristan; Mandelbaum, Tal; Duncan, Ian; Tustison, Nicholas; Kadlecek, Stephen; Chatterjee, Shampa; Gee, James C; Rizi, Rahim R; Berra, Lorenzo; Cereda, Maurizio",Critical care medicine,403,16

We aimed to synthesize relevant qualitative evidence on families' experiences and psychosocial service needs across the lifespan to identify gaps in care delivery and research. METHODS Searches were conducted in Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Embase, and Web of Science. Identified papers were assessed with the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool. Data were extracted into NVivo12 and analyzed by qualitative description and, where appropriate, thematic analysis. RESULTS The search yielded 628 papers, of which 40 (33 studies) were eligible (6%). Although the methodological quality of the papers was low, we identified concerns that were consistently reported over time and from different perspectives. Individual family members had varying psychosocial needs to be addressed within healthcare, schooling, and public policy. These include for survivor's mental health (particularly for body image), and to the disproportionate biopsychosocial burden faced by mother-caregivers.

Ablative and excisional treatment modalities are restricted for use with high-grade pre-cancerous cervical disease with HPV infection and low-grade dysplasia mostly managed by a watch-and-wait policy. AREAS COVERED Various pharmacological approaches have been investigated as non-destructive alternatives for the treatment of HR-HPV infection and associated dysplasia. These are discussed dealing with efficacy, ease-of-use (physician or self-applied), systemic or locally applied, side-effects, cost and risks. The main focus is the perceived impact on current clinical practice of a self-applied, effective and safe pharmacological anti-HPV treatment. EXPERT OPINION Current prophylactic HPV vaccines are expensive, HPV type restricted and have little effect in already infected women. Therapeutic vaccines are under development but are also HPV type-restricted. At present, the developed nations use national cytology screening and surgical procedures to treat only women identified with HPV-related high-grade dysplastic disease. However, since HPV testing is rapidly replacing cytology as the test-of-choice, a suitable topically-applied and low-cost antiviral treatment could be an ideal solution for treatment of HPV infection per se with test-of-cure carried out by repeat HPV testing. Cytology would only then be necessary for women who remained HPV positive. Although of significant benefit in the developed countries, combining such a treatment with self-sampled HPV testing could revolutionise the management of this disease in the developing world which lack both the infrastructure and resources to establish national cytology screening programs.","Hampson, Lynne; Martin-Hirsch, Pierre; Hampson, Ian N",Expert opinion on investigational drugs,403,1

Though select members in the field have advocated for an enhanced presence of these specialists in policy conversations, little work has been done to thoroughly evaluate the moral and ethical obligations of the pathologist and the role they play in healthcare justice and access to care. In order to make any substantive improvements in access to care, pathology and laboratory medicine must have a seat at the table. Specifically, pathologists and laboratorians can assist in bringing about change through improving clinician test choice, continuing laboratory improvement programmes, promoting just advanced diagnostic distribution, triage testing and be good stewards of healthcare dollars, and recruiting a more robust laboratory workforce. In order to get to that point, much work has to be done in pathology education and the laboratory personnel training pipeline but there also needs to be adjustments at the system level to better involve this invaluable group of specialists in these policy conversations.","Lilley, Cullen M; Mirza, Kamran M",Journal of medical ethics,403,31

There remains a paucity of information on anatomical luminal variations of the major venous sinuses which may contribute to the etiology of certain disease states. Thirty-six transverse and sigmoid sinuses were removed following dissection of 19 unfixed cadaveric heads. Sinuses were opened longitudinally to study luminal variations. A semiquantitative classification system was developed to assess septations and blind pouches. Seventy-nine percent of cadavers had a luminal anatomical variation. Forty-four percent and 42% of sinuses dissected had occurrence of a septations or blind pouches, respectively. Thirty percent of septations and 25% of pouches were classified as large. Incidence of anatomical variations was not statistically significant between cadaver gender or sinus laterality. Luminal variations are present in the transverse and sigmoid sinuses at rates higher than expected. This study is the first to report the presence of blind pouches in the luminal wall of transverse and sigmoid sinuses.

However, the transcript variant and temporal expression pattern of EZH2 in the middle and late porcine fetus are still unknown. Here, we identified the coding sequence of the EZH2 gene and characterized its expression pattern in fetal tissues of Duroc pigs at 65- and 90-day postcoitus (dpc). Our results showed that the coding sequence of EZH2 was 2241 bp, encoding 746 amino acids. There were 9 amino acid insertions and an amino acid substitution in this transcript compared with the validated reference sequence in NCBI. EZH2 was ubiquitously expressed in the fetal tissues of two time points with different expression levels. These results validated a different transcript in pigs and characterized its expression profile in fetal tissues of different gestation stages, which indicated that EZH2 played important roles during porcine embryonic development.","Tan, Baohua; Hong, Linjun; Qiao, Jiaxin; Zhou, Jian; Xing, Pingping; Yan, Guanhao; Zheng, Enqin; Cai, Gengyuan; Huang, Sixiu; Wu, Zhenfang; Gu, Ting",BioMed research international,403,30

Although UDL is recognized as a promising approach for school-based rehabilitation health professionals (RHPs), there are no studies that synthesize evidence on the use of UDL by RHPs in the school setting. Therefore, the research question for this study is: How is UDL described and implemented in school settings by RHPs? This study specifically examined literature from occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and speech-language pathology. METHODS A scoping review was completed to (a) summarize how UDL is described in the rehabilitation literature, (b) summarize the recommended and reported role of RHPs in the delivery of UDL, and (c) identify gaps in the evidence base. CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science, and ERIC electronic databases were searched. Numerical summaries and theoretical thematic analysis were used to describe the data both quantitatively and qualitatively. RESULTS Inclusion criteria were achieved for 45 of the 3,998 screened documents. Most of the included documents lacked a definition of UDL. Analysis suggested that speech-language pathologists and occupational therapists implement UDL in a variety of ways within the school setting. No physiotherapy literature was found, and limited high-level empirical research has been conducted within rehabilitation. CONCLUSION This scoping review provides a broad understanding of how RHPs describe and implement UDL-aligned services in school settings. UDL is a promising framework that provides RHPs with guidance on how to support children with diverse needs in the classroom, with the overall aim to promote inclusion of all children. There is a need for further research to determine the effectiveness of UDL as implemented by RHPs and to examine the role of physiotherapists in using UDL-type services.","Kennedy, J; Missiuna, C; Pollock, N; Wu, S; Yost, J; Campbell, W","Child: care, health and development",403,28

OBJECTIVE This study aims to evaluate feedback from patients with CHF following participation in the Innovative Telemonitoring Enhanced Care program for CHF (ITEC-CHF) study. METHODS The telemonitoring intervention consisted of three components: remote weight monitoring, structured telephone support, and nurse-led collaborative care. Participants were provided with electronic weighing scales (W550; ForaCare), and a computer tablet (Galaxy Tab A; Samsung). They were asked to weigh themselves on the provided scales daily. Telemonitoring was integrated with a personal assistance call service and a nurse care service according to their workflows in usual care. Feedback on the usability of ITEC-CHF was collected via survey from study participants following 6 months of receiving telemonitoring care for their body weight. Survey responses were provided on a 5-point Likert scale and through open-ended questions to determine participants' perceived benefits and barriers to using ITEC-CHF. RESULTS A total of 67 participants (49/67, 73% male), with a mean age of 69.8 (SD 12.4) years completed the survey. The majority of participants agreed or strongly agreed that the ITEC-CHF program was easy to use (61/67, 91%), easy to navigate (51/65, 78%), useful (59/65, 91%), and made them feel more confident in managing their weight (57/67, 85%). Themes related to participants' perceptions of telemonitoring included increased support for early intervention of clinical deterioration, improved compliance to daily weighing, a sense of reassurance, and improved self-care and accountability, among others. CONCLUSIONS ITEC-CHF was rated highly on usability and was well accepted by users as part of their routine self-management activities. Participants were willing to use telemonitoring because they perceived a broad spectrum of benefits for CHF management.

METHODS One hundred sixty-one CRLM nodules in 101 patients and 122 HCC nodules in 97 patients were treated with thermal ablation. Complications and local efficacy were retrospectively compared. RESULTS Major complications were observed in two (2.0%) patients in the CRLM group and one (1.0%) in the HCC group (p = 1.000). The complete ablation (CA) rate of lesions ≤ 3 cm was lower in the CRLM group than in the HCC group (p = 0.018). After a mean follow-up period of 21.1 ± 20.7 months in the CRLM group and 22.1 ± 17.6 months in the HCC group, the local tumour progression (LTP) rate of lesions > 3 cm was higher in the CRLM group than in the HCC group (p = 0.036). The multivariate analysis revealed that only safety margin (≤ 0.5 cm/> 0.5 cm) was a significant predictor of LTP in both CRLM and HCC. CONCLUSIONS To achieve better local tumour control, thermal ablation should be more aggressive for CRLM than for HCC, especially for large tumours in clinical.","Liu, Ming; Huang, Guang-Liang; Xu, Ming; Pan, Fu-Shun; Lu, Ming-de; Zheng, Ke-Guo; Kuang, Ming; Xie, Xiao-Yan","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",403,1

A function assay that evaluates platelet reactivity and inhibition by drug therapy is beneficial for such patients. Platelet Mapping assay (PM) using the TEG analyzer was tested in surgical patients. After IRB approval, 60 patients on combined aspirin and clopidogrel therapy were consented and enrolled. The TEG maximal amplitude (MA) and the percentage (%) platelet inhibition were recorded and analyzed. Fifty-seven patients (mean age 65.7 ± 10.9 years) had preoperative data only. Distribution of preoperative ADP (43.6 ± 24.4%) and AA inhibition (52.8 ± 30.2%) was determined, as well as for the preoperative MA ADP (43.1 ± 15.9 mm) and MA AA (37.2 ± 19.6 mm), showing an offset of the effect of both medications starting from day 3. Patients with complete pre- and postoperative data were stratified depending on duration off antiplatelet therapy (≤3 days, 3-7 days and >7 days): n = 27, ADP % preop inhibition (43.2 ± 21.6%), ADP % postop inhibition (32.3 ± 18.3%), p = 0.048.

Hypothermia has been tested as a treatment for HIE in pdiglet models and subsequently proven effective in clinical trials. Variations of the model have been applied in the study of adjunctive neuroprotective methods and piglet studies of xenon and melatonin have led to clinical phase I and II trials(1,2). The piglet HIE model is further used for neonatal resuscitation- and hemodynamic studies as well as in investigations of cerebral hypoxia on a cellular level. However, it is a technically challenging model and variations in the protocol may result in either too mild or too severe brain injury. In this article, we demonstrate the technical procedures necessary for establishing a stable piglet model of neonatal HIE. First, the newborn piglet (< 24 hr old, median weight 1500 g) is anesthetized, intubated, and monitored in a setup comparable to that found in a neonatal intensive care unit. Global hypoxia-ischemia is induced by lowering the inspiratory oxygen fraction to achieve global hypoxia, ischemia through hypotension and a flat trace amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG) indicative of cerebral hypoxia. Survival is promoted by adjusting oxygenation according to the aEEG response and blood pressure. Brain injury is quantified by histopathology and magnetic resonance imaging after 72 hr.","Kyng, Kasper J; Skajaa, Torjus; Kerrn-Jespersen, Sigrid; Andreassen, Christer S; Bennedsgaard, Kristine; Henriksen, Tine B",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,403,11

However, poor interlayer network formation can limit a VP-printed part's tensile strength along the build axis. We demonstrate that the incorporation of carbamate bonds capable of undergoing dissociative exchange reactions provides improved interlayer network formation in VP-printed urethane acrylate polymers. In the presence of dibutyltin dilaurate catalyst, the exchange of these carbamate bonds enables rapid stress relaxation with an activation energy of 133 kJ/mol, consistent with a dissociative bond exchange process. Annealed XY tensile samples containing a catalyst demonstrate a 25% decrease in Young's modulus, attributed to statistical changes in network topology, while samples without a catalyst show no observable effect. Annealed ZX tensile samples printed with layers perpendicular to tensile load demonstrate an increase in elongation at break, indicative of self-healing. The strain at break for samples containing a catalyst increases from 33.9 to 56.0% after annealing but decreases from 48.1 to 32.1% after annealing in samples without a catalyst. This thermally activated bond exchange process improves the performance of VP-printed materials via self-healing across layers and provides a means to change Young's modulus after printing. Thus, the incorporation of carbamate bonds and appropriate catalysts in the VP-printing process provides a robust platform for enhancing material properties and performance.","Hamachi, Leslie S; Rau, Daniel A; Arrington, Clay B; Sheppard, Daylan T; Fortman, David J; Long, Timothy E; Williams, Christopher B; Dichtel, William R",ACS applied materials & interfaces,403,1

However, the requirement for strong organic solvent in polymerization reactions often necessitates extra protection steps for encapsulation of target biomolecules, lowering encapsulation efficiency, and increasing process complexity. This study reports a novel coating strategy that allows direct solvation and encapsulation of antimicrobial peptides (HHC36) into anhydrous polycaprolactone (PCL) polymer-based dual layer coating. A thin 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) film is layered onto the peptide-impregnated PCL as a diffusion barrier, to modulate and enhance release kinetics. The impregnated peptides are eventually released in a controlled fashion. The use of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), as polymerization and solvation medium, induces the impregnated peptides to adopt highly stable turned conformation, conserving peptide integrity, and functionality during both encapsulation and subsequent release processes. The dual layer coating showed sustained antibacterial functionality, lasting for 14 days. In vivo assessment using an experimental mouse wounding model demonstrated good biocompatibility and significant antimicrobial efficacy of the coating under physiological conditions. The coating was translated onto silicone urinary catheters and showed promising antibacterial efficacy, even outperforming commercial silver-based Dover cather. This anhydrous polymer-based platform holds immense potential as an effective antibacterial coating to prevent clinical device-associated infections. The simplicity of the coating process enhances its industrial viability.","Lim, Kaiyang; Saravanan, Rathi; Chong, Kelvin K L; Goh, Sharon H M; Chua, Ray R Y; Tambyah, Paul A; Chang, Matthew W; Kline, Kimberly A; Leong, Susanna S J",Biotechnology and bioengineering,403,7

METHODS In this systematic review study, international databases (Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus) were searched for the relevant studies published in English from the inception of databases until July 30, 2020. Hoy et al.'s tool was used to evaluate the quality of studies. All search steps, screening, selection of studies, quality assessment, and data extraction were performed separately by two researchers. RESULTS Out of 3460 articles searched, 28 articles conducted on 16,427 HCWs were included in the study. Most of the HCWs had good knowledge (72.2%), a positive attitude (70.9%), and good practice (78.8%) towards COVID-19. The most important clinical recommendation to improve knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) was to provide HCWs with a periodic training program regarding COVID-19. The most important source of information for HCWs on COVID-19 was social networks. CONCLUSIONS Despite HCWs' good knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP), it is recommended to periodically review KAP and carry out further studies in different countries as well.

MATERIAL AND METHODS At the turn of May and June 2020, an online survey was conducted on a representative sample of 3000 Poles (age: Me = 45 years). Working persons accounted for 52% of the respondents, while 38.1% were hired workers. Two standardized (0-100 pts) indices were defined. The level of mental health symptoms index (LMHSI) concerned the incidence of 4 problems within the past 2 months, whereas the change in mental health symptoms index (CMHSI) concerned the degree of mental health deterioration. RESULTS The mean value of LMHSI was 40.91 (SD = 26.97), and that of CMHSI 60.51 (SD = 23.97). In both cases, a worse assessment was obtained among women than among men. In the group of working respondents, the least advantageous results were found among those who worked casually or under a commission contract. Among the non-employed respondents, jobless persons and students were the group at risk. Remote work resulted in the deterioration of mental health in the light of CMHSI; however, a threat of changes in the professional situation affected LMHSI variability to the greatest extent The results of linear regression (R2 = 0.339) suggest that the increase in the CMHSI score (adjusted for LMHSI) is independently influenced by female sex, university education, remote work and a threat of the worsening of employment terms. The analysis of the interaction effect showed a stronger impact of the last factor in the group of women (p = 0.001).

Due to the cytokine storm, the mortality rate in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is high, but until now no therapy for these patients was approved. The aim of this review was to discuss the possible anti-inflammatory effect of photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) on ARSD patients and present the potential role of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in the improvement of respiratory symptoms associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: Studies about PBMT in inflammation and ARSD patients were examined. A primary search with reviewing English-language citations between 2005 and 2020 using the keywords COVID-19, ADRS, cytokine storm, low-level laser therapy, anti-inflammatory, and photobiomodulation was performed. The initial search yielded 818 articles; however, 60 articles were selected and discussed in the present study. Results: The results of the selected studies showed the usefulness of PBMT in the treatment of inflammation and ARSD in patients with COVID-19 infection. This therapy is non-invasive and safe to modulate the immune responses in ARSD patients. Conclusion: PBMT can potentially reduce the viral load and bacterial super-infections in patients with COVID-19 infection and control the inflammatory response. Therefore, the use of PBMT could be an efficient strategy for preventing severe and critical illness in SARS-COV2 infection.","Jahani Sherafat, Somayeh; Mokmeli, Soheila; Rostami-Nejad, Mohammad; Razaghi, Zahra; Rezaei Tavirani, Mostafa; Razzaghi, Mohammadreza",Journal of lasers in medical sciences,403,1

We aimed to identify cancer-related risk factors for poor COVID-19 outcomes. Patients and Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the University of California Health COVID Research Data Set. This database includes prospectively-collected, electronic health data of patients who underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 at seventeen California medical centers. We identified adult patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between February 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, and selected a cohort of patients with cancer using diagnostic codes. We obtained demographic, comorbidity, laboratory, cancer type, and antineoplastic therapy data. The primary outcome was hospitalization within 30 days after first positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Secondary outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 positivity and composite endpoint for severe COVID-19 (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, or death within 30 days after first positive test). We used multivariable logistic regression to identify cancer-related factors associated with outcomes. Results: We identified 409,462 patients undergoing SARS-CoV-2 testing. Of 49,918 patients with cancer, 1,781 (3.6%) tested positive. Patients with cancer were less likely to test positive (OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.66-0.73, P<0.001). BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis) (OR 2.51, 95%CI 1.29-4.89, P=0.007); venetoclax (OR 3.63, 95%CI 1.02-12.92, P=0.046); methotrexate (OR 3.65, 95%CI 1.17-11.37, P=0.026); Asian race (OR 1.92, 95%CI 1.23-2.98, P=0.004); and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (OR 1.96, 95%CI 1.41-2.73, P<0.001) were associated with increased hospitalization risk. Among 388 hospitalized patients with cancer and COVID-19, cancer type and therapy type were not associated with severe COVID-19. Conclusions: In this large, diverse cohort of Californians, cancer was not a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Patients with BCR/ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm and patients receiving methotrexate or venetoclax may be at an increased risk of hospitalization following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

These observations were obtained by the overlay of JHMV-infected cells onto receptor-negative cells that are otherwise resistant to wt JHMV infection. MHVR-independent infection is hypothetically thought to be attributed to a naturally occurring fusion activation of the wt JHMV S protein, which did not occur in the case of srr7. Attachment of S protein on cells without MHVR during the S-protein activation process seems to be a key condition. Thus, in the present study, we tried to see whether wt JHMV virions that are attached on MHVR-negative cells are able to infect those cells. In order to make virions attach to the cell surface without MHVR, we have used spinoculation, namely, the centrifugation of cells together with inoculated virus at 3,000 rpm for 2 h. This procedure forces viruses to attach to the cell surface, as revealed by quantitative estimation of attached virions by real-time PCR and also facilitated wt JHMV infection to MHVR-negative cells, but failed to do so for srr7. Virions of both wt and srr7 attached on MHVR-negative cells by spinoculation were facilitated for infection in the presence of a soluble form of MHVR that induces conformational changes of both wt and srr7. It was further revealed that wt JHMV S1, but not srr7, was released from the cell surface when S protein was expressed on cells. These observations support the hypothesis that attachment of the virion to MHVR-negative cells is a critical step and that a unique feature of wt JHMV S1 to be released from S2 in a naturally occurring event is involved in an MHVR-independent infection.","Watanabe, Rie; Matsuyama, Shutoku; Taguchi, Fumihiro",Journal of virology,403,9

Then, the treated plasma samples with Cur@PLGA-NPs plus blue laser were exposed to Vero cells. Eventually, cell cytotoxicity and apoptotic effects of treated Vero cells were evaluated. Levels of clotting factors including prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), total plasma proteins, and anti-A and/or anti-B antibodies measurements were performed using the coagulometer, method of Bradford, and titration procedure, respectively. RESULTS: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was positive in 84.3 % of samples. Different concentrations of Cur@PLGA-NPs (3, 5, 7, and 10 % wt.), the irradiation times of blue laser (1, 3, and 5 min), and aPDT with the maximum dosed of blue laser light (522.8 J/cm2) plus 10 % wt. Cur@PLGA-NPs had no cytotoxicity. Although there were significant cell degradation and apoptotic effects in treated Vero cells with treated plasma using 10 % wt. Cur@PLGA-NPs, and a blue laser at an energy density of 522.8 J/cm2, no visible changes in cells and apoptosis were observed following aPDT. Total plasma protein content, PT, APTT, and anti-A and/or anti-B antibodies titers showed no significant changes (P > 0.05 for all comparisons) in treated plasma as compared to untreated plasma. CONCLUSION: aPDT exhibited in vitro anti-COVID-19 activities in the treated plasma containing SARS-COV-2 without Vero cell apoptosis and any adverse effects on plasma quality in aPDT-exposed plasma.","Pourhajibagher, Maryam; Azimi, Maryam; Haddadi-Asl, Vahid; Ahmadi, Hanie; Gholamzad, Mehrdad; Ghorbanpour, Sara; Bahador, Abbas",Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,403,29

METHODS: In April 2020, we surveyed a national probability sample of 2279 U.S. adults using an online panel recruited through address-based sampling. Households received a computer and internet access if needed to participate in the panel. Participants were invited via e-mail and answered online survey questions about their willingness to get a novel coronavirus vaccine when one became available. The survey was completed in English and Spanish. We report weighted percentages. RESULTS: Most respondents were willing to get the vaccine for themselves (75%) or their children (73%). Notably, Black respondents were less willing than White respondents (47% vs. 79%, p < 0.001), while Hispanic respondents were more willing than White respondents (80% vs. 75%, p < 0.003). Females were less likely than makes (72% vs. 79%, p < 0.001). Those without insurance were less willing than the insured (47% vs. 78%, p < 0.001). Willingness to vaccinate was higher for those age 65 and older than for some younger age groups (85% for those 65 and older vs. 75% for those 50-64, p < 0.017; 72% for those 35-49, p < 0.002; 70% for those 25-34, p = NS and 75% for ages 18-24, p = NS), but other groups at increased risk because of underlying medical conditions or morbid obesity were not more willing to get vaccinated than their lower risk counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Most Americans were willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine, but several vulnerable populations reported low willingness. Public health efforts should address these gaps as national implementation efforts continue.","Kelly, Bridget J; Southwell, Brian G; McCormack, Lauren A; Bann, Carla M; MacDonald, Pia D M; Frasier, Alicia M; Bevc, Christine A; Brewer, Noel T; Squiers, Linda B",BMC Infect Dis,403,16

Although the national medical staff and Public Health Epidemic Prevention personnel are fighting the epidemic, the large numbers of patients and the long-term isolation measures greatly impacted people's lifestyles. The epidemic's development has currently been eased, but the blockades and quarantines in many cities have not been completely lifted. While controlling the coronavirus, lifestyle changes caused by long-term isolation, as well as fear of the disease and economic recession have brought people various negative emotions. These mental health issues may cause or aggravate the occurrence and development of dry eye. Therefore, the authors explore the impact of mental health on dry eye during the COVID-19 epidemic, alongside possible mechanisms, and put forward relevant suggestions for managing eye-related diseases during and after the epidemic.","Yu, Yi; Zhou, Yiwen; Wan, Shanshan; Huang, Yuqing; Wang, Huiling; Yang, Yanning",Zhonghua Shiyan Yanke Zazhi Chin.

For a correct interpretation of the pulmonary findings in this new era, it is, however, crucial to be familiar with pathologic pulmonary conditions observed in postmortem investigations in general. Adequate postmortem histopathological evaluation of the lungs may be affected by suboptimal gross work up, autolysis or poor fixation. Using a standardized preparation approach which consisted in instillation of 4% buffered formaldehyde through the large bronchi for proper fixation and preparing large frontal tissue sections of 1–2 cm thickness after at least 24 h fixation, we comprehensively analyzed postmortem pulmonary findings from consecutive adult autopsies of a two-year period before the occurrence of COVID-19 (2016–2017). In total, significant pathological findings were observed in 97/189 patients (51%), with 28 patients showing more than one pathologic condition. Acute pneumonia was diagnosed 33/128 times (26%), embolism 24 times (19%), primary pulmonary neoplasms 18 times (14%), organizing pneumonia and other fibrosing conditions 14 times (11%), pulmonary metastases 13 times (10%), diffuse alveolar damage 12 times (9%), severe emphysema 9 times (7%) and other pathologies, e.g., amyloidosis 5/128 times (4%). Pulmonary/cardiopulmonary disease was the cause of death in 60 patients (32%). Clinical and pathological diagnoses regarding lung findings correlated completely in 75 patients (40%). Autopsy led to confirmation of a clinically suspected pulmonary diagnosis in 57 patients (39%) and clarification of an unclear clinical lung finding in 16 patients (8%). Major discrepant findings regarding the lungs (N = 31.16%) comprised cases with clinical suspicions that could not be confirmed or new findings not diagnosed intra vitam. A significant proportion of acute pneumonias (N = 8;24% of all cases with this diagnosis;p = 0.011) was not diagnosed clinically. We confirmed the frequent occurrence of pulmonary pathologies in autopsies, including inflammatory and neoplastic lesions as the most frequent pathological findings.

One such strategy includes utilizing the knowledge gained from the SARS and MERS outbreaks regarding existing antivirals. Indicating a potential for success, one of the drugs, remdesivir, under repurposing studies, has shown positive results in initial clinical studies. Therefore, in the current work, the authors have attempted to utilize the remdesivir-RdRp complex - RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) being the putative target for remdesivir - to screen a library of the already reported RdRp inhibitor database. Further clustering on the basis of structural features and scoring refinement was performed to filter out false positive hits. Finally, molecular dynamics simulation was carried out to validate the identification of hits as RdRp inhibitors against novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. The results yielded two putative hits which can inhibit RdRp with better potency than remdesivir, subject to further biological evaluation.","Singh, P K; Pathania, S; Rawal, R K",SAR QSAR Environ Res,403,21

Although this can provide efficacy in the majority of eyes, a sizeable proportion do not respond sufficiently and many continue to receive anti-VEGF therapy after it may be optimal. This imposes a treatment burden on both patients and clinicians and, most importantly of all, can be sight threatening. Changing treatment to an intravitreal corticosteroid implant at the appropriate time may help optimise patient outcomes and reduce injection frequency, thereby reducing treatment burden. Eight retina specialists convened to discuss how to ensure eyes with CI-DMO receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy are evaluated for a potential change to intravitreal corticosteroid therapy at the most effective time in their treatment journey. They concluded that clear criteria on when to consider changing treatment would be helpful and so developed a consensus guideline covering key decision points such as when and how to assess response to anti-VEGF therapy, when to consider a change to corticosteroid therapy and when and how to assess the response to corticosteroid therapy. The guideline was developed before the COVID-19 pandemic but, with the additional challenges arising from this including even greater pressure on clinic capacity, it is more important than ever to reconsider current working practices and adopt changes to improve patient care while also easing pressure on clinic capacity, reducing hospital visits and maintaining patient safety. This publication therefore also includes suggestions for adapting the guidelines in the COVID-19 era. ©","Downey, L.; Acharya, N.; Devonport, H.; Gale, R.; Habib, M.; Manjunath, V.; Mukherjee, R.; Severn, P.",BMJ Open Ophthalmology,403,1

Our aim was to describe the planning of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in terms of timing related to the course of the COVID-19 epidemic and research question evaluated. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We performed a living mapping of RCTs registered in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We systematically search the platform every week for all RCTs evaluating preventive interventions and treatments for COVID-19 and created a publicly available interactive mapping tool at https://covid-nma.com to visualize all trials registered. RESULTS: By August 12, 2020, 1,568 trials for COVID-19 were registered worldwide. Overall, the median ([Q1-Q3]; range) delay between the first case recorded in each country and the first RCT registered was 47 days ([33-67]; 15-163). For the 9 countries with the highest number of trials registered, most trials were registered after the peak of the epidemic (from 100% trials in Italy to 38% in the United States). Most trials evaluated treatments (1,333 trials; 85%); only 223 (14%) evaluated preventive strategies and 12 postacute period intervention. A total of 254 trials were planned to assess different regimens of hydroxychloroquine with an expected sample size of 110,883 patients. CONCLUSION: This living mapping analysis showed that COVID-19 trials have relatively small sample size with certain redundancy in research questions. Most trials were registered when the first peak of the pandemic has passed.","Nguyen, Van Thu; Rivière, Philippe; Ripoll, Pierre; Barnier, Julien; Vuillemot, Romain; Ferrand, Gabriel; Cohen-Boulakia, Sarah; Ravaud, Philippe; Boutron, Isabelle",J Clin Epidemiol,403,20

First, a rotation-based precoding is developed to solve the above problems independently. Rotation-based precoding is new precoding and power allocation that beats existing solutions in PHY security and multicasting and is reliable in different antenna settings. Next, a DNN-based precoder is designed to unify the solution for all objectives. The proposed DNN concurrently learns the solutions given by conventional methods, i.e., analytical or rotation-based solutions. A binary vector is designed as an input feature to distinguish the objectives. Numerical results demonstrate that, compared to the conventional solutions, the proposed DNN-based precoder reduces on-the-fly computational complexity more than an order of magnitude while reaching near-optimal performance (99.45\% of the averaged optimal solutions). The new precoder is also more robust to the variations of the numbers of antennas at the receivers.","Zhang, Xinliang; Vaezi, Mojtaba",,403,29

Furthermore, certain advantages of online teaching, such as detailed and high-quality annotation of lecture slides using the Apple Pencil and iPad, were observed. While online teaching has its unique strengths, it could not provide students with hands-on experience in performing real biology experiments to master technical skills; the latter are essential for students to develop a career in conducting research in an academic or industrial laboratory setting.

For the 0.22 μm module, the cake layer, the gel layer and the membrane contributed 6.3 log, 3.1 log and 1.7 log, respectively to phage removal, confirming the importance of the cake/gel layer formed on the surface of membrane. The damage of the cake/gel layer resulted in the decrease of phage removal. As for the 0.1 μm one, the membrane alone played a major role in phage removal. Inactivation by activated sludge and adsorption by cake/gel layer contributed about 3.6 log to phage removal everyday so that there was no phage accumulation in bulk solution.

Invasive aspergillosis has been found in critically ill COVID patients. Despite this strong association, there are no reports of aspergillus empyema related to COVID-19 pneumonia. Here, we present a case of post COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by aspergillus empyema and abscess. CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year-old woman with a history of poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus, and uncomplicated asymptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia 2 months prior, presented with 1 month of worsening productive cough, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and fatigue. On admission, she was afebrile, tachycardiac, tachypneic with decreased right sided breath sounds and rhonchi. Her initial labs revealed a white blood cell count of 11.18 k/mcL, a chest x-ray revealed a right posterior lung field cavity with air-fluid level with right upper and lower lung field opacification (Fig. 1). Chest CT showed a right 16 x 5.5-centimeter rim enhancing consolidative opacity with air-fluid level and effusion (Fig. 3). Ultrasound guided thoracentesis revealed frank pus with pleural fluid studies pertinent for glucose 281 mg/dl, total protein 3.7 mg/dl, and fungal culture positive for Aspergillus niger. She underwent right-sided 14-french pigtail catheter placement to drain the empyema and was discharged to complete 4 weeks of oral levofloxacin, metronidazole, and isavuconazole for 6 weeks. Her symptoms resolved on 3 months follow up and imaging showed improvement in right lung field fluid collections with residual lung scarring and fibrosis (Fig. 3). DISCUSSION: COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) has been reported in multiple case series in hospitalized individuals with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with high mortality rates.1The use of corticosteroids and anti-IL6 drugs has shown an increase in susceptibility to superimposed infections.2,3 Diagnosis of CAPA generally requires a recent history of COVID-19 pneumonia with clinical worsening, abnormal thoracic radiography, and aspergillus recovered on culture or microscopy. Treatment includes either voriconazole or isavuconazole as the first line agent unless resistance is suspected. We report the first case of COVID-19 associated Aspergillus niger lung abscess empyema in a post-COVID patient. CONCLUSIONS: It is imperative for clinicians to have a high index of suspicion for superimposed fungal infections associated with COVID-19 even in those without the more well-described risk factors of prior tretament with corticosteroids and/or IL-6 agents, due to the risk of significant mortality and morbidity. Early initiation of treatment with close surveillance to include thoracic imaging should be done for patients who develop post COVID-19 necrotizing pneumonia.

To date, the mental health status and challenges of foreign workers during the pandemic have been neglected in the literature. This cross‐sectional web‐based survey assessed levels of post‐traumatic stress, depression, anxiety and insomnia among an international sample of foreign workers (n = 319) resident in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The majority of participants were female (76%), European (69%) and highly educated (83% had a bachelor's or higher degree). Results indicate high rates of post‐traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia, especially among women, younger individuals, and those with a previous diagnosis of a psychological disorder. Additionally, foreign workers' perceptions of pandemic severity in their home nations (mild, moderate, severe) were positively correlated with their symptom levels of depression, anxiety and insomnia. Overall, these findings may help inform future public mental health strategy and pandemic preparedness plans with reference to safeguarding the psychological wellbeing of foreign workers.","Barbato, Mariapaola; Thomas, Justin",Int J Psychol,403,21

This study aimed to develop and validate a novel prediction model of COVID-19 progression. METHODS: In total, 814 patients in the training set were included to develop a novel scoring system; and 420 patients in the validation set were included to validate the model. RESULTS: A prediction score, called ACCCDL, was developed on the basis of six risk factors associated with COVID-19 progression: age, comorbidity, CD4(+) T cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). For predicting COVID-19 progression, the ACCCDL score yielded a significantly higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) compared with the CALL score, CoLACD score, PH-COVID-19 score, neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio, and lymphocyte–monocyte ratio both in the training set (0.92, 0.84, 0.83, 0.83, 0.76, and 0.65, respectively) and in the validation set (0.97, 0.83, 0.83, 0.78, 0.74, and 0.60, respectively). Over 99% of patients with the ACCCDL score < 12 points will not progress to severe cases, and over 30% of patients with the ACCCDL score > 20 points will progress to severe cases. CONCLUSION: The ACCCDL score could stratify patients with at risk of COVID-19 progression, and was useful in regulating the large flow of patients with COVID-19 between primary health care and tertiary centers.","Xu, Wei; Huang, ChenLu; Fei, Ling; Li, WeiXia; Xie, XuDong; Li, Qiang; Chen, Liang",Infect Dis Ther,403,24

The viral spike S glycoprotein binds to the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and then is activated by the host proteases. Based on the accessibility of the cellular proteases needed for SARS-S activation, SARS-CoV-2 entrance and activation can be mediated by endosomal (such as cathepsin L) and non-endosomal pathways. Evidence indicates that in the non-endosomal pathway, the viral S protein is cleaved by the furin enzyme in infected host cells. To help the virus enter efficiently, the S protein is further activated by the serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), provided that the S has been cleaved by furin previously. In this review, important roles for host proteases within host cells will be outlined in SARS-CoV-2 infection and antiviral therapeutic strategies will be highlighted. Although there are at least five highly effective vaccines at this time, the appearance of the new viral mutations demands the development of therapeutic agents. Targeted inhibition of host proteases can be used as a therapeutic approach for viral infection.","Rahbar Saadat, Yalda; Hosseiniyan Khatibi, Seyed Mahdi; Zununi Vahed, Sepideh; Ardalan, Mohammadreza",Front Mol Biosci,403,27

This allows bacteria to descend the respiratory tract unchallenged. BRDC is the costliest disease among feedlot cattle, and whilst vaccines exist for individual pathogens, there is still a lack of evidence for the efficacy of these vaccines and uncertainty surrounding the optimum timing of delivery.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a nationwide retrospective cohort study in people admitted to hospital in England with COVID-19 requiring admission to a high dependency unit (HDU) or intensive care unit (ICU) between 1 March 2020 and 27 July 2020. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate 30-day in-hospital all-cause mortality associated with type 2 diabetes, with adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, and other major comorbidities (chronic respiratory disease, asthma, chronic heart disease, hypertension, immunosuppression, chronic neurological disease, chronic renal disease, and chronic liver disease). RESULTS: A total of 19,256 COVID-19–related HDU and ICU admissions were included in the primary analysis, including 13,809 HDU (mean age 70 years) and 5,447 ICU (mean age 58 years) admissions. Of those admitted, 3,524 (18.3%) had type 2 diabetes and 5,077 (26.4%) died during the study period. Patients with type 2 diabetes were at increased risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.23 [95% CI 1.14, 1.32]), and this result was consistent in HDU and ICU subsets. The relative mortality risk associated with type 2 diabetes decreased with higher age (age 18–49 years aHR 1.50 [95% CI 1.05, 2.15], age 50–64 years 1.29 [1.10, 1.51], and age ≥65 years 1.18 [1.09, 1.29]; P value for age–type 2 diabetes interaction = 0.002).

The initiation of RSV infection of immortalized cells is largely dependent on cell surface heparan sulfate (HS), a receptor for the RSV attachment (G) glycoprotein in immortalized cells. However, RSV infects the ciliated cells in primary well differentiated human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures via the apical surface, but HS is not detectable on this surface. Here we show that soluble HS inhibits infection of immortalized cells, but not HAE cultures, confirming that HS is not the receptor on HAE cultures. Conversely, a “non-neutralizing” monoclonal antibody against the G protein that does not block RSV infection of immortalized cells, does inhibit infection of HAE cultures. This antibody was previously shown to block the interaction between the G protein and the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 and we have mapped the binding site for this antibody to the CX3C motif and its surrounding region in the G protein. We show that CX3CR1 is present on the apical surface of ciliated cells in HAE cultures and especially on the cilia. RSV infection of HAE cultures is reduced by an antibody against CX3CR1 and by mutations in the G protein CX3C motif. Additionally, mice lacking CX3CR1 are less susceptible to RSV infection. These findings demonstrate that RSV uses CX3CR1 as a cellular receptor on HAE cultures and highlight the importance of using a physiologically relevant model to study virus entry and antibody neutralization.","Johnson, Sara M.; McNally, Beth A.; Ioannidis, Ioannis; Flano, Emilio; Teng, Michael N.; Oomens, Antonius G.; Walsh, Edward E.; Peeples, Mark E.",PLoS Pathog,403,16

To get shielded through this war, the world is racing to reach and manufacture COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccination hesitancy is one of the significant obstacles to global health. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the perception and attitude of healthcare workers in Egypt toward COVID-19 vaccines, acknowledge the determinants of their attitude, and the factors that could increase the acceptance of the vaccine. METHODS: an observational web-based anonymous survey was conducted on 385 Egyptian healthcare workers in different governorates. The questionnaire-based on Vaccine Hesitancy Survey Questions of the World Health Organization was available in Arabic and English languages and was tested for reliability. RESULTS: Regarding vaccination decision, 51% of the participants were undecided, 28% refused, and 21% accepted vaccination. Reasons for vaccine acceptance mainly were risks of COVID-19 (93%), safety (57.5%), and effectiveness (56.25%) of the vaccine. Simultaneously, the reasons for vaccine hesitancy were the absence of enough clinical trials (92.4%) and fear of side effects of the vaccine (91.4%). The leading factor that could increase vaccination acceptance among the participants was to get sufficient and accurate information about the available vaccines. The participants revealed a high mean level of concern for COVID-19 vaccines’ safety (3.8 of 5) that differs significantly among the different study groups (P-value .002). CONCLUSION: Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, only approximately 21% of Egyptian healthcare workers in our study accepted the COVID-19 vaccination.

Genetic and pharmacologic studies have previously established a pathologic role for ATX and LPA signaling in pulmonary injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. Here, increased ENPP2 mRNA levels were detected in immune cells from nasopharyngeal swab samples of COVID-19 patients, and increased ATX serum levels were found in severe COVID-19 patients. ATX serum levels correlated with the corresponding increased serum levels of IL-6 and endothelial damage biomarkers, suggesting an interplay of the ATX/LPA axis with hyperinflammation and the associated vascular dysfunction in COVID-19. Accordingly, dexamethasone (Dex) treatment of mechanically ventilated patients reduced ATX levels, as shown in two independent cohorts, indicating that the therapeutic benefits of Dex include the suppression of ATX. Moreover, large scale analysis of multiple single cell RNA sequencing datasets revealed the expression landscape of ENPP2 in COVID-19 and further suggested a role for ATX in the homeostasis of dendritic cells, which exhibit both numerical and functional deficits in COVID-19. Therefore, ATX has likely a multifunctional role in COVID-19 pathogenesis, suggesting that its pharmacological targeting might represent an additional therapeutic option, both during and after hospitalization.","Nikitopoulou, Ioanna; Fanidis, Dionysios; Ntatsoulis, Konstantinos; Moulos, Panagiotis; Mpekoulis, George; Evangelidou, Maria; Vassiliou, Alice G.; Dimakopoulou, Vasiliki; Jahaj, Edison; Tsipilis, Stamatios; Orfanos, Stylianos E.; Dimopoulou, Ioanna; Angelakis, Emmanouil; Akinosoglou, Karolina; Vassilaki, Niki; Tzouvelekis, Argyrios; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Aidinis, Vassilis",Int J Mol Sci,403,24

STAR-Caregivers Virtual Training and Follow-up (STAR-VTF) is adapted from an evidence-based, in-person program that trains family caregivers to manage BPSD. We used a human-centered design approach to obtain feedback from family caregivers about STAR-VTF. The program will be evaluated using a pragmatic randomized trial. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to understand the needs of family caregivers for improving BPSD management and the extent to which caregivers perceived that STAR-VTF could address those needs. METHODS: Between July and September 2019, we conducted 15 semistructured interviews with family caregivers of people with dementia who receive care at Kaiser Permanente Washington in the Seattle metropolitan area. We identified participants from electronic health records, primarily based on a prescription for antipsychotic medication for the person with dementia (a proxy for caregivers dealing with BPSD). We showed caregivers low-fidelity prototypes of STAR-VTF online self-directed materials and verbally described potential design elements. We obtained caregiver feedback on these elements, focusing on their needs and preferences and perceived barriers to using STAR-VTF. We used a hybrid approach of inductive and deductive coding and aggregated codes to develop themes. RESULTS: The idea of a virtual training program for learning to manage BPSD appealed to caregivers. They said health care providers did not provide adequate education in the early disease stages about the personality and behavior symptoms that can affect people with dementia. Caregivers found it unexpected and frustrating when the person with dementia began experiencing BPSD, symptoms they felt unprepared to manage. Accordingly, caregivers expressed a strong desire for the health care organization to offer programs such as STAR-VTF much sooner. Caregivers had already put considerable effort into problem solving challenging behaviors. They anticipated deriving less value from STAR-VTF at that point. Nonetheless, many were interested in the virtual aspect of the training due to the convenience of receiving help from home and the perception that help from a virtual program would be timelier than traditional service modalities (eg, face to face). Given caregivers’ limited time, they suggested dividing the STAR-VTF content into chunks to review as time permitted. Caregivers were interested in having a STAR-VTF provider for additional support in managing challenging behaviors. Caregivers reported a preference for having the same coach for the program duration. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers we interviewed would likely accept a virtual training program such as STAR-VTF to obtain information about BPSD and receive help managing it. Family caregivers anticipated deriving more value if STAR-VTF was offered earlier in the disease course.","Ramirez, Magaly; Duran, Miriana C; Pabiniak, Chester J; Hansen, Kelly E; Kelley, Ann; Ralston, James D; McCurry, Susan M; Teri, Linda; Penfold, Robert B",JMIR Aging,403,8

Scientists working on these boards have faced many challenges, including working under significant time constraints to produce ‘evidence’ as quickly as possible. However, their voices are still largely missing in the discussion. This study explores the views and experiences of scientists working on government advisory boards during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the aim to learn lessons for future pandemic management and preparedness. METHODS: We conducted online video or telephone semi-structured interviews between December 2020 and April 2021 with 21 scientists with an official government advisory role during the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium, the Netherlands, UK, Sweden and Germany. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed and analysed using a combination of inductive and deductive thematic analysis techniques. RESULTS: Scientists viewed the initial focus on biomedically oriented work during the pandemic as somewhat one-dimensional, but also highlighted difficulties of working in an interdisciplinary way. They found it difficult at times to ensure that the evidence is understood and taken on board by governments. They found themselves taking on new roles, the boundaries of which were not clearly defined. Consequently, they were often perceived and treated as a public figure. CONCLUSION: Scientists working on advisory boards in European countries faced similar challenges, highlighting key lessons to be learnt. Future pandemic preparedness efforts should focus on building interdisciplinary collaboration through development of scientists’ skills and appropriate infrastructure; ensuring transparency in how boards operate; defining and protecting the boundaries of the scientific advisor role; and supporting scientists to inform the public in the fight against disinformation, while dealing with potential hostile reactions.","Colman, Elien; Wanat, Marta; Goossens, Herman; Tonkin-Crine, Sarah; Anthierens, Sibyl",BMJ Glob Health,403,16

We aimed to study the effect of corticosteroids in the treatment of adult inpatients with COVID-19. Methods A retrospective cohort of 115 consecutive adult COVID-19 patients admitted to The Third Peoples Hospital of Hubei Province between Jan 18, 2020, and Feb 28, 2020 was analysed to study the effectiveness of corticosteroid. They were categorized according to whether or not corticosteroid therapy was given, and compared in terms of demographic characteristics, clinical features, laboratory indicators and clinical outcomes. The primary endpoint was defined as either mortality or intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Known adverse prognostic factors were used as covariates in multiple logistic regressions to adjust for their confounding effects on outcomes. Results Among 115 patients, 73 patients (63.5%) received corticosteroid. The levels of age, C-reactive protein, D-dimer and albumin were similar in both groups. The corticosteroid group had more adverse outcomes (32.9% vs. 11.9%) and statistically significant differences were observed (p=0.013). In multivariate analysis, corticosteroid treatment was associated with a 2.155-fold increase in risk of either mortality or ICU admission, although not statistically significant. Conclusion No evidence suggests that adult patients with COVID-19 will benefit from corticosteroids, and they might be more likely to be harmed with such treatment.","Wang, Dan; Wang, Juan; Jiang, Qunqun; Yang, Juan; Li, Jun; Gao, Chang; Jiang, Haiwei; Ge, Lintong; Liu, Yongming",,403,1

However, antibiotics may be accompanied by many side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort and allergies. The aim of this study was to develop an alternative antibiotic herbal veterinary medicine for alleviating pneumonia in weanling piglets. As observed in the pig ranches, many weanling piglets suffer from the pneumonia and also show high expression of angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE‐2) in their respiratory and intestinal tracts. ACE inhibitors have been reported that can decrease pneumonia risk through their main mechanism of action. Thus, we also try to find alternative antibiotic feed additives that can reduce expression of ACE‐2 in piglets. We selected the Guizhi Li‐Zhong Tang Extract Granules (GLZ) as a natural product for piglets. Then, we compared the serum immunoglobulin levels of piglets with sham, tilmicosin antibiotic (TAB), and GLZ treatments. Our results showed that piglets with GLZ treatment had significantly a higher expression of immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G but a lower expression of immunoglobulin E than those with sham and TAB treatments. In addition, piglets with GLZ treatment showed obviously low pneumonia incidence than those with sham and TAB treatments. Similarly, piglets with GLZ treatment showed significantly lower expressions of ACE‐2 in their tracheal, bronchial, and lung tissues than those with sham and TAB treatments. GLZ seems to be an alternative ACE inhibitor that can decrease pneumonia risk through inhibiting ACE‐2 expression and alleviating allergies in their respiratory systems. Thus, we suggest that GLZ can be an alternative antibiotic feed additive for weaning piglets.","Lu, Chen‐Wen; Wang, Sheue‐Er; Wu, Wan‐Jhen; Su, Li‐Yu; Wang, Che‐Hsuan; Wang, Pei‐Hwa; Wu, Chung‐Hsin",Food Sci Nutr,403,14

Vitamin D influences expression of many genes with well-established relevance to airway infections and relevant to immune system function. Recently, VDD has been shown to be a risk factor for acquisition and severity of COVID-19. Thus, treating VDD presents a safe and inexpensive opportunity for modulating the severity of the disease. VDD is common in those over 60 years of age, many with co-morbid conditions and in people with skin pigmentation sufficient to reduce synthesis of vitamin D. Exposure to fine particulate air pollution is also associated with worse outcomes from COVID19. Vitamin D stimulates transcription of cathelicidin which is cleaved to generate LL37. LL37 is an innate antimicrobial with demonstrated activity against a wide range of microbes including envelope viruses. LL37 also modulates cytokine signaling at the site of infections. Fine particles in air pollution can interfere with LL37 destruction of viruses and may reduce effective immune signaling modulation by LL37. While vitamin D influences transcription of many immune related genes, the weakened antimicrobial response of those with VDD against SARS-CoV-2 may be in part due to reduced LL37. Conclusion: Vitamin D plays an important role reducing the impact of viral lung disease processes. VDD is an acknowledged public health threat that warrants population-wide action to reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. While vitamin D influences transcription of many immune related genes, the weakened antimicrobial response of those with VDD against SARS-CoV-2 may be in part due to reduced LL37. Action is needed to address COVID-19 associated risks of air pollution from industry, transportation, domestic sources and from primary and second hand tobacco smoke.","Crane-Godreau, Mardi A.; Clem, Kathleen J.; Payne, Peter; Fiering, Steven",Front Public Health,403,3

However in the USA, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been politically polarized. The objective of this study is to investigate the association between political partisanship and COVID-19 deaths rates in the USA. METHODS: This study used longitudinal county-level panel data, segmented into 10 30-day time periods, consisting of all counties in the USA, from 22 January 2020 to 5 December 2020. The outcome measure is the total number of COVID-19 deaths per 30-day period. The key explanatory variable is county political partisanship, dichotomized as Democratic or Republican. The analysis used a ZINB regression. RESULTS: When compared with Republican counties, COVID-19 death rates in Democratic counties were significantly higher (IRRs ranged from 2.0 to 18.3, P < 0.001) in Time 1–Time 5, but in Time 9–Time10, were significantly lower (IRRs ranged from 0.43 to 0.69, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The reversed trend in COVID-19 death rates between Democratic and Republican counties was influenced by the political polarized response to the pandemic. The findings support the necessity of evidence-based public health leadership and management in maneuvering the USA out of the current COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future public health crises.","Chen, Hsueh-Fen; Karim, Saleema A",J Public Health (Oxf),403,10

Among 3271 COVID-19 patients treated at the Hospital University Institute Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France from 3 March to 27 April 2020, tested at least twice by qRT-PCR, the median SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal shedding duration was 6 days (range 2–54 days). Compared with short shedders (qRT-PCR positivity < 10 days), 34 (1.04%) persistent shedders (qRT-PCR positivity ≥ 17 days; mean ± SD: 23.3 ± 3.8 days) were significantly older, with associated comorbidities, exhibiting lymphopenia, eosinopenia, increased D-dimer and increased troponin (p < 0.05), and were hospitalized in intensive care unit in 17.7% vs. 1.1% of cases (p < 0.0001). Viral culture was positive in six persistent shedders after day 10, including in one patient after day 17, and no viral co-pathogen was detected in 33 tested patients. Persistent shedders received azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine ≥ 3 days in 26/34 (76.5%) patients, a figure significantly lower than in short shedders (86.6%) (p = 0.042). Accordingly, mortality was 14.7% vs. 0.5% (p < 0.0001). Persistent shedding was significantly associated with persistent dyspnea and anosmia/ageusia (p < 0.05). In the context of COVID-19 treatment, including treatment with azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine, the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal shedding was a rare event, most frequently encountered in elderly patients with comorbidities and lacking azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine treatment.","Drancourt, Michel; Cortaredona, Sébastien; Melenotte, Cléa; Amrane, Sophie; Eldin, Carole; La Scola, Bernard; Parola, Philippe; Million, Matthieu; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Raoult, Didier; Colson, Philippe",Viruses,403,24

This paper reflects, from both academic and lived experience perspectives, on involving people with lived experience in a study exploring cancer care in prison and how by doing this it enriched the research process. METHODS: This paper is based on written and verbal reflections of the lived experience researchers and academic researchers involved in a study exploring the diagnosis and treatment of people with cancer in prison. The study comprised interviews with people with cancer in prison, prison healthcare staff, oncology specialists and custodial staff. Lived experience researchers were involved throughout the research process, including co-conducting interviews with patients and analysing interviews. RESULTS: This paper highlights the importance and value of including lived experience researchers across the research process. We reflect on how lived experience of prison shapes the experience of conducting interviews and analysing data gathered in prison. We reflect on the working relationships between academic and lived experience researchers. We demonstrate how prison research is challenging, but collaboration between lived experience and academic researchers can help to better prepare for the field, to ask more meaningful questions and to create rapport with participants. These types of collaborations can be powerful avenues for skill development for both academic and lived experience researchers, but they require an investment of time and a willingness for shared learning. CONCLUSIONS: For academics and lived experience researchers to collaborate successfully and meaningfully care needs to be taken to develop open, honest and equal working relationships. Skills development for academic and lived experience researchers is important. A commitment to building and maintaining relationships is crucial. Having a third party as a mediator can facilitate and foster these relationships. Particularly with people with lived experience of prison it is essential to put the ‘do no harm’ principle into practice and to have support in place to minimise this.

Affected calves exhibit tympany, hemorrhagic abomasitis, and abomasal ulceration. Gram-positive bacilli are often found on affected mucosa and in submucosa. Aspects of etiology beyond the infecting organism are little understood, but probably include dietary issues, perhaps relating to overfeeding, feeding of barely thawed or contaminated colostrum, or conditions which effect decreased gut motility. Fatal hemorrhagic enteritis in a cloned gaur calf is illustrative of the syndrome. The calf developed pasty yellow and bloody diarrhea, and the abdomen became distended and painful. In spite of intensive therapy, the calf died ∼48 h after birth. At necropsy, the distended abomasum contained clotted milk and bloody fluid, and the abomasal and omasal walls were thickened and hemorrhagic. The proximal duodenum was hemorrhagic and emphysematous, and microscopic examination revealed Gram-positive rods in association with acute, necrotizing, hemorrhagic mucosal inflammation. Isolates of C. perfringens from this calf were PCR positive for cpb2, the gene encoding beta2 toxin. This finding is of unknown significance; only 14.3% (8/56) of isolates from other calves with the syndrome have been cpb2 positive, and only 50% of cpb2 positive bovine isolates express CPB2. The most prominent needs to further our understanding of this problem are consistent experimental reproduction of the disease, elucidation of virulence attributes, and development and application of prevention and control strategies.","Glenn Songer, J.; Miskimins, Dale W.",Anaerobe,403,20

The 5,677 nucleotide genome contains five large open reading frames (ORFs). The genes for the coat protein (1) and the putative viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were identified. The latter shows a striking degree of similarity to that of carnation mottle virus (CarMV). By comparison with corona- and retrovirus RNAs, it is proposed that a translational frameshift is involved in expression of the polymerase. An ORF encoding an Mr 49,797 protein (50K ORF) may be translated by in-frame readthrough of the coat protein stop codon.

The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) initiative’s campaign involves a proportional framework to finance and distribute SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in low- and middle-income countries. However, the COVAX framework has critical limitations, including limited funding and the failure to account for the special epidemic risks and needs of its participating nations, as recommended by the World Health Organization’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization framework. These drawbacks disproportionately impact Africa, where many nations rely on COVAX as their main source of vaccines. The current plan to vaccinate only up to 20% of participating nations’ populations is short-sighted from both epidemiologic and moral perspectives. COVAX must commit to vaccinating all of Africa and its initiative must be modified to account for the health and economic infrastructures in these countries. Lessons learned from successful vaccination campaigns, including the West African Ebola outbreak, have shown that vaccinating all of Africa is possible and feasible, and that infrastructure and human resources can support mass vaccination. To halt this global pandemic, global responsibility must be accepted to finance and equitably distribute SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to African nations.

Many of these viruses can only be propagated under high containment levels, necessitating the development of low containment surrogate systems such as subgenomic replicons and minigenome systems. Replicons are self-amplifying recombinant RNA molecules expressing proteins sufficient for their own replication but which do not produce infectious virions. Replicons can persist in cells and are passed on during cell division, enabling quick, efficient and high-throughput testing of drug candidates that act on viral transcription, translation and replication.
