A reduced-intensity conditioning based on fludarabin, carmustin/BCNU and melphalan (FBM) has been previously developed at our institution. Since we observed detrimental effects in individual patients with compromised lung function, efforts have been made in order to replace BCNU by thiotepa (FTM) to reduce toxicity. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the outcome, GvHD incidence, lung function and organ toxicity of patients with a median age of 62 years (range 21–79) transplanted for malignant disease (96.7%, 62.3% in intermediate/advanced disease stage) at our institution after conditioning with FBM (n = 136) or FTM (n = 105) between 2013 and 2017. Median follow-up was 868 days (range 0–2615). In multivariate analysis for overall survival, no difference was detected between both conditioning protocols in the presence of impaired lung function, age, lower performance, and liver disease previous allo-HCT. In the subgroup analysis, FTM was not inferior to FBM in patients with pulmonary disease prior allo-HCT, lymphoid malignancies, and higher comorbidity index. In conclusion, the reduced-intensity FBM and FTM conditioning protocols show adequate antineoplastic efficacy and are suitable for patients with impaired lung function.","Duque-Afonso, Jesús; Ihorst, Gabriele; Waterhouse, Miguel; Zeiser, Robert; Wäsch, Ralph; Bertz, Hartmut; Yücel, Mehtap; Köhler, Thomas; Müller-Quernheim, Joachim; Marks, Reinhard; Finke, Jürgen",Bone Marrow Transplant,598,1

Although rankings allow a direct and quantitative comparison of countries, sometimes they provide a rather oversimplified representation, in which relevant aspects related to socio-economic development are either not properly considered or still analyzed in silos. In an increasingly data-driven society, a new generation of cutting-edge technologies is breaking data silos, enabling new use of public indicators to generate value for multiple stakeholders. We propose a complex network framework based on publicly available indicators to extract important insight underlying global rankings, thus adding value and significance to knowledge provided by these rankings. This approach enables the unsupervised identification of communities of countries, establishing a more targeted, fair and meaningful criterion to detect similarities. Hence, the performance of states in global rankings can be assessed based on their development level. We believe that these evaluations can be crucial in the interpretation of global rankings, making comparison between countries more significant and useful for citizens and governments and creating ecosystems for new opportunities for development.","Bellantuono, Loredana; Monaco, Alfonso; Tangaro, Sabina; Amoroso, Nicola; Aquaro, Vincenzo; Bellotti, Roberto",Sci Rep,598,1

In particular, there is little research regarding whether social support has a mediating effect on the relationship between physical activity and aging anxiety. Accordingly, this study investigated how social support affected physical activity and aging anxiety in 778 prospective senior citizens (55 to 65 years old) out of a total of 1447 senior citizens who participated in the Embrain Panel Power and Panel Marketing Interactive. Participants completed the IPAQ (International Physical Activity Questionnaires), Social Support Scale, and Aging Anxiety Scale. Physical activity in these Korean pre-older adults affected aging anxiety (p < 0.001), with a fixed effect of physical activity on social support (p < 0.001). Further, social support affected aging anxiety (p < 0.001). Social support was also an important parameter in the relationship between physical activity and aging anxiety. In conclusion, high physical activity of pre-older Korean persons lowered their anxiety regarding aging. Social support acted as a mediator that lowered anxiety regarding aging in the most active pre-older persons.","Oh, Ahra; Kim, Jiyoun; Yi, Eunsurk; Shin, Jongseob",Int J Environ Res Public Health,598,1

Average Annual Percent Changes (AAPC) were calculated by the period before and after 2008. The expected rates of 2009–2016 and the observed-to-expected rate ratios (RR) were calculated. Correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were used to test the impact of socio-economic variables on health outcomes; (3) Results: A reverse in downwards trends of PNM, IMR, and NNMR is observed since 2009. All observed values of 2009–2016 were found significantly higher than the expected ones by 12–34%. All indicators except SBR were found negatively correlated with GDP and DHI. A positive correlation was found between IMR, NNMR, and LBW and long-term unemployment, and no association with public health expenditure; (4) Conclusions: Economic crisis was associated with remarkable adverse effects on perinatal outcomes and infant mortality, mainly determined by long-term unemployment and income reduction.

However, the mechanism of virulence enhancement of variant PRV is currently unclear. Here, a recombinant PRV (rPRV HN1201-EGFP-Luc) with stable expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and firefly luciferase as a double reporter virus was constructed on the basis of the PRV variant HN1201 through CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology coupled with two sgRNAs. The biological characteristics of the recombinant virus and its lethality to mice were similar to those of the parental strain and displayed a stable viral titre and luciferase activity through 20 passages. Moreover, bioluminescence signals were detected in mice at 12 h after rPRV HN1201-EGFP-Luc infection. Using the double reporter PRV, we also found that 25-hydroxycholesterol had a significant inhibitory effect on PRV both in vivo and in vitro. These results suggested that the double reporter PRV based on PRV variant HN1201 should be an excellent tool for basic virology studies and evaluating antiviral agents.","Fu, Peng-Fei; Cheng, Xuan; Su, Bing-Qian; Duan, Li-Fang; Wang, Cong-Rong; Niu, Xin-Rui; Wang, Jiang; Yang, Guo-Yu; Chu, Bei-Bei",Vet Res,598,1

Although community-acquired sepsis is more common, hospital-acquired infection is more lethal. The most common site of infection is the lung, followed by abdominal infection, catheter-associated blood steam infection and urinary tract infection. Gram-negative sepsis is more common than gram-positive infection, but sepsis can also be due to fungal and viral pathogens. To reduce mortality, it is necessary to give immediate, empiric, broad-spectrum therapy to those with severe sepsis and/or shock, but this approach can drive antimicrobial overuse and resistance and should be accompanied by a commitment to de-escalation and antimicrobial stewardship. Biomarkers such a procalcitonin can provide decision support for antibiotic use, and may identify patients with a low likelihood of infection, and in some settings, can guide duration of antibiotic therapy. Sepsis can involve drug-resistant pathogens, and this often necessitates consideration of newer antimicrobial agents.","Niederman, Michael S.; Baron, Rebecca M.; Bouadma, Lila; Calandra, Thierry; Daneman, Nick; DeWaele, Jan; Kollef, Marin H.; Lipman, Jeffrey; Nair, Girish B.",Crit Care,598,1

We discuss the effects of a VR restorative environment on the emotional and cognitive recovery of individuals with mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression. First, we built a VR restorative garden scene, divided into four areas: forest, lawn, horticultural planting, and water features. The scene was verified to have a good recovery effect in 26 participants. Then, 195 participants with mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression were selected as experimental subjects. Through psychological testing and EMG (Electromyography) and EEG (Electroencephalography) data feedback, we further explored the differences in the sense of presence in VR restorative scenes and their effect on individual emotional and cognitive recovery. The results showed that (1) both the restorative environment images and the VR scenes had a healing effect (the reduction in negative emotions and the recovery of positive emotions and cognition), with no difference in the subjective feeling of recovery among the different scenes, but the recovery score of the VR urban environment was higher than that of the natural environment (differing from the results in real environments); (2) a high sense of presence can be experienced in different VR scenes, and interactive activities in VR scenes can provide a great presence experience; (3) the recovery effects of VR restorative environment on emotion and self-efficacy are realized through the presence of VR scenes; (4) a VR restorative environment is helpful for the emotional improvement and cognitive recovery of individuals with mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression. VR urban scenes also have good recovery effects. In terms of cognitive recovery, self-efficacy improved significantly. In addition, from the perspective of EEG indicators, the VR restorative scene experience activated the prefrontal lobe, which is conducive to cognitive recovery in individuals with mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression. In terms of emotional improvement, negative emotions were significantly reduced in the different VR scene groups. In conclusion, we further explored ways to help individuals with mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression, in order to promote the development and application of mental health.","Li, Hongqidi; Dong, Wenyi; Wang, Zhimeng; Chen, Nuo; Wu, Jianping; Wang, Guangxin; Jiang, Ting",Int J Environ Res Public Health,598,1

Despite the high effectiveness of Gottman’s psychoeducational intervention, there is a lack of study on the online Gottman’s psychoeducation intervention (O-GPI) to improve marital communication and dyadic adjustments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of O-GPI on the improvement of marital communication patterns among Iranian couples. Method: The study followed a single-blind parallel group in a randomized controlled trial using an experimental longitudinal design, comprising 72 heterosexual couples living in Shiraz, Iran, with a 1–7-year marital age and no severe marital problems. The experimental group received eight consecutive O-GPIs via the Zoom platform, while the control group received information related to parenting skills via email. The outcome measures were the three patterns of communication: (i) constructive communication; (ii) demand–withdraw communication; and (iii) mutual avoidance communication—the screening measure was the dyadic adjustment scale. Results: The findings indicated that O-GPI could improve couples’ constructive communication significantly (45% for husbands and 40% wives) and decrease their total demand–withdrawal (51% for husbands and 65% wives) and mutual avoidance communication (60% for husbands and 62% wives). Limitations: Due to the homogenous nature of the sample, generalizations should be made with caution. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the online Gottman’s psychoeducational intervention to improve couples’ communication patterns.","Deylami, Neda; Hassan, Siti Aishah; Alareqe, Naser Abdulhafeeth; Zainudin, Zaida Nor",Int J Environ Res Public Health,598,1

Although invasive, it can be very useful as a source of essential oils, pharmaceuticals, biopesticides, and bioenergy. However, very limited information exists on the molecular basis of its different utility as previous investigations were mainly focused on phytochemical/biological activity profiling. Here we have explored various properties of A. conyzoides that may offer environmental, ecological, agricultural, and health benefits. As this aromatic plant harbors many important secondary metabolites that may have various implications, biotechnological interventions such as genomics, metabolomics and tissue-culture can be indispensable tools for their mass-production. Further, A. conyzoides acts as a natural reservoir of begomoviruses affecting a wide range of plant species. As the mechanisms of disease spreading and crop infection are not fully clear, whole-genome sequencing and various advanced molecular technologies including RNAi, CRISPER/Cas9, multi-omics approaches, etc., may aid to decipher the molecular mechanism of such disease development and thus, can be useful in crop protection. Overall, improved knowledge of A. conyzoides is not only essential for developing sustainable weed control strategy but can also offer potential ways for biomedicinal, environment, safe and clean agriculture applications.

Isolates from a 2011 outbreak in the NICU were retrieved from frozen stocks and analyzed by MALDI-TOF. The MALDI typing was compared with core genome multilocus sequence typing (cg-MLST). MALDI typing divided the 33 outbreak isolates into 2 clones: sequence type (ST)-290 and 405. These results were in complete agreement with cg-MLST results. The differentiation of the outbreak isolates into two clones correlated with the patients’ location in the NICU, but also with their place of residence.

It is yet to be determined how the pandemic affected neuro-oncology patient outcomes, given that the majority of even “elective” neurosurgical oncology procedures are time-sensitive. This study quantifies changes in neuro-oncological care during the height of the pandemic in New York City and investigates patient outcomes in 2020 compared to a historical control. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients with brain tumor diagnoses (primary or secondary) who were seen at the Weill Cornell Brain and Spine Center between March 13, 2020 and May 1, 2020. A control cohort from the corresponding time period in 2019 was also reviewed. Alterations in care, including shift from in-person to telehealth, delays in evaluation and intervention, and treatment modifications were evaluated. These variables were analyzed with respect to brain tumor control and mortality. RESULTS: 114 patients from 2020 and 171 patients from 2019 were included, with no significant difference in baseline demographics between the groups. There was no significant difference in outcomes between the cohorts, despite significantly more treatment delays (p= 0.0154) and use of telehealth (p< 0.0001) in 2020. For patients treated during the pandemic in 2020, patients who experienced delays in care did not suffer from worse outcomes compared to those without delays. Patients who utilized telehealth visits had significantly more stable tumor control (P = 0.0027), consistent with appropriate use of in-person visits for patients with progression. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that use of telehealth and selective alterations in neuro-oncological care during the COVID-19 pandemic did not lead to adverse patient outcomes. This suggests that adaptive physician-led changes during the pandemic were successful and effective. Further studies are needed to evaluate impact on long-term survival.","Norman, Sofya; Juthani, Rupa",Neuro Oncol,598,1

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate these possible alterations in a sample of survivors in the aftermath of earthquake exposure, with particular attention to gender differences and impact of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods: High school senior students, who had been exposed to the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake, were enrolled 21 months after the traumatic event and evaluated by the Trauma and Loss Spectrum Self-Report to investigate PTSD rates and by a domain of the Mood Spectrum Self-Report–Lifetime Version (MOODS-SR), to explore alterations in circadian/seasonal rhythms and vegetative functions. Results: The rates of endorsement of MOODS-SR rhythmicity and vegetative functions domain and subdomain scores were significantly higher in survivors with PTSD with respect to those without it. Among all earthquake survivors, women reported higher scores than men on the rhythmicity and vegetative functions domain and subdomain scores, except for the rhythmicity and sexual functions ones. Female survivors without PTSD showed significantly higher scores than men in the rhythmicity and vegetative functions total scores and the sleep and weight and appetite subdomains. Potentially traumatic events burden predicted rhythmicity and vegetative functions impairment, with a moderation effect of re-experiencing symptoms. Conclusions: We report impairments in rhythmicity, sleep, eating, and sexual and somatic health in survivors to a massive earthquake, particularly among subjects with PTSD and higher re-experiencing symptoms, with specific gender-related differences. Evaluating symptoms of impaired rhythmicity and vegetative functions seems essential for a more accurate assessment and clinical management of survivors to a mass trauma.","Carmassi, Claudia; Dell'Oste, Valerio; Bertelloni, Carlo Antonio; Foghi, Claudia; Diadema, Elisa; Mucci, Federico; Massimetti, Gabriele; Rossi, Alessandro; Dell'Osso, Liliana",Front Psychiatry,598,1

OBJECTIVE To demonstrate the utility of a modified anesthesia protocol for ECT utilizing preoxygenation by facemask and withholding the use of BMV for only those patients who desaturate during the apneic period. METHODS This chart review study analyzes patients who were treated with ECT using both the traditional and modified anesthesia protocols. RESULTS A total of 106 patients were analyzed, of whom 51 (48.1%) required BMV using the new protocol. Of clinical factors, only patient BMI was significantly associated with the requirement for BMV. Mean seizure duration reduced from 52.0 ± 22.4 to 46.6 ± 17.1 s, but seizure duration was adequate in all cases. No acute physical, respiratory, or psychiatric complications occurred during treatment. CONCLUSIONS A modified anesthesia protocol reduces the use of BMV by more than 50%, while retaining adequate seizure duration.","Luccarelli, James; Fernandez-Robles, Claudia; Fernandez-Robles, Carlos; Horvath, Ryan J; Berg, Sheri; McCoy, Thomas H; Seiner, Stephen J; Henry, Michael E",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,598,1

This study is one of two meta-analyses that examined sickness absenteeism in nursing. In this study, we examined demographic, lifestyle, and physical health predictors. Methods: We reviewed five databases (CINAHL, ProQuest Allied, ProQuest database theses, PsycINFO, and PubMed) for our search. We registered the systematic review (CRD de-identified) and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Additionally, we used the Population/Intervention/Comparison/Outcome Tool to improve our searches. Results: Following quality testing, 17 articles were used for quantitative synthesis. Female employees were at higher risks of sickness absenteeism than their male counterparts (OR = 1.73;95% CI: 1.33–2.25). Nursing staff who rated their health as poor had a greater likelihood of experiencing sickness absence (OR = 1.38;95% CI: 1.19-1.60). Also, previous sick leave predicted future leaves (OR = 3.35;95% CI: 1.37–8.19). Moreover, experiencing musculoskeletal pain (OR = 2.41 95% CI: 1.77–3.27) increased the likelihood of sickness absence with greater odds when it is a back pain (OR = 3.05;95% CI: 1.66–5.62). Increased age, physical activity, and sleep were not associated with sick leave. Conclusion: Several variables were statistically associated with the occurrence of sickness absenteeism. One primary concern is the limited research in this area despite alarming rates of sick leave in healthcare. More research is required to identify predictors of sickness absence, and thereby, implement preventative measures. © 2021","Gohar, B.; Larivière, M.; Lightfoot, N.; Larivière, C.; Wenghofer, E.; Nowrouzi-kia, B.",Safety and Health at Work,598,25

Currently, COVID-19 evolves in many countries to a second stage, characterized by the need for the liberation of the economy and relaxation of the human psychological effects. To this end, numerous countries decided to implement adequate deconfinement strategies. After the first prolongation of the established confinement, Morocco moves to the deconfinement stage on May 20, 2020. The relevant question concerns the impact on the COVID-19 propagation by considering an additional degree of realism related to stochastic noises due to the effectiveness level of the adapted measures. In this paper, we propose a delayed stochastic mathematical model to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 in Morocco after the deconfinement. To ensure the well-posedness of the model, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a positive solution. Based on the large number theorem for martingales, we discuss the extinction of the disease under an appropriate threshold parameter. Moreover, numerical simulations are performed in order to test the efficiency of the deconfinement strategies chosen by the Moroccan authorities to help the policy makers and public health administration to make suitable decisions in the near future.","Zine, Houssine; Boukhouima, Adnane; Lotfi, El Mehdi; Mahrouf, Marouane; Torres, Delfim F.

In particular, the most effective measures in this direction have been the stay-at-home and closure strategies of businesses and schools. However, population-wide lockdowns are far from being optimal carrying heavy economic consequences. Therefore, there is nowadays a strong interest in designing more efficient restrictions. In this work, starting from a recent kinetic-type model which takes into account the heterogeneity described by the social contact of individuals, we analyze the effects of introducing an optimal control strategy into the system, to limit selectively the mean number of contacts and reduce consequently the number of infected cases. Thanks to a data-driven approach, we show that this new mathematical model permits to assess the effects of the social limitations. Finally, using the model introduced here and starting from the available data, we show the effectivity of the proposed selective measures to dampen the epidemic trends.","Dimarco, G.; Toscani, G.; Zanella, M.",,598,1

284958,284958,284958,Thank you Covidentologists,23.990036,6.050858,2020,"BACKGROUND: Nurses have been labelled ""heroes"" by politicians, the mass media, and the general public to describe their commitment to providing front-line care to people with COVID-19, despite the risks of exposure and lack of clinical resources. Few studies have examined the implications of the hero discourse to nurses' professional, social, and political identities. OBJECTIVE: To critically examine the effects of the hero discourse on nurses who are contending with the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and to consider the political, social, cultural, and professional impact of this discourse on nursing work. METHODS: A poststructural discourse analysis, employing the theoretical ideas of truth, power, knowledge, subjectivity, and normalization, was conducted to explore the mass media's constructions of nurse as hero in the contexts of COVID-19. Media electronic databases were searched between March 1, 2020 to August 1, 2020 to locate newspaper and magazine articles, corporate advertisements, videos, social media postings, and institutional/corporate websites. SETTING: Data sources included English language media accounts that originated from Canada, the USA, and the UK. RESULTS: Three main elements of the hero discourse include: 1. Nurses as a ""necessary sacrifice"" - portraying nurses as selfless, sacrificing, and outstanding moral subjects for practicing on the front-line without adequate protective gear and other clinical resources; 2. Nurses as ""model citizens"" - positioning nurses as compliant, hardworking, and obedient subjects in contrast to harmful individuals and groups that ignore or resist COVID-19 public health measures. 3. Heroism itself as the reward for nurses - characterizing hero worship as a fitting reward for nurses who were unappreciated pre-pandemic, as opposed to supporting long-term policy change, and highlighting how heroism reconfigures nursing work from the mundane and ordinary to the exciting and impactful. CONCLUSIONS: The hero discourse is not a neutral expression of appreciation and sentimentality, but rather a tool employed to accomplish multiple aims such as the normalization of nurses' exposure to risk, the enforcement of model citizenship, and the preservation of existing power relationships that limit the ability of front-line nurses to determine the conditions of their work. Our study has implications for approaching the collective political response of nursing in the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and formalizing the ongoing emotional, psychological, ethical, and practice supports of nurses as the pandemic continues.","Mohammed, Shan; Peter, Elizabeth; Killackey, Tieghan; Maciver, Jane",Int J Nurs Stud,598,16

More recently, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) restrictions have led to an escalation in clinical services through telemental health settings. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to consider perspectives of Marriage and Family Therapists (MFT)s who are working in telemental health settings prior to and/or as a result of COVID-19 restrictions and consider the role that telemental health has in building therapeutic connections with clients. Researchers presented an online survey that explored participants' perceptions of providing telemental health. Participants included 23 MFTs who were currently licensed or working under an MFT supervisor. Data analysis uncovered the following thematic responses: (a) doing telemental health is similar, but different, than in-person therapy, (b) adapting to telemental health is worthwhile, and (c) validating clients' voices and experiences is fundamental to building an alliance in telemental health therapy. Findings supported the importance of further training in telemental health, specifically related to cultural humility and alliance building within telemental health settings.","Glass, Valerie Q; Bickler, Aurélia",Contemp Fam Ther,598,21

During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the Israeli Ministry of Health initially mandated that all psychological assessments be postponed. However, as referrals to time-sensitive, high-need, and high-stakes assessments began to accumulate, it became necessary to consider remote solutions. In the current paper, we describe the considerations that affected the transition to remote activity in a prominent Israeli provider of neuropsychological assessment and rehabilitation services, referring to technological and environmental conditions, cognitive requirements, and tasks, as well as to legal, regulatory, and funding issues. After discussing how assessments should be conducted to maximize feasibility and validity while minimizing risks to clients and clinicians, we propose a preliminary model for deciding whether specific referrals warrant remote administration. The model delineates key factors in decisions regarding remote assessment, emphasizing the distinct roles of the referring clinician and the neuropsychologist who conducts the assessment, and highlighting the need for collaboration between them. The abrupt need for remote assessments during the pandemic required a quick response with little preparation. The lessons learned from this process can be applied in the future, so that the need for remote services can be met with greater certainty and uniformity.","Bloch, Ayala; Maril, Sari; Kavé, Gitit",Isr J Health Policy Res,598,1

This exploratory study aimed to examine how the increase in media consumption was related to subjective happiness and psychological well-being. For this purpose, a questionnaire was administered to a sample of Spanish adults (n = 249;53.8% women;aged between 18 and 75, M &lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 42.06, SD = 12.37) to assess their consumption of different media before and during confinement. Moreover, participants were evaluated for hedonic, eudaimonic, social, and experienced happiness by using the Pemberton Happiness Index (PHI). The results underlined the great increase in the consumption of TV for entertainment and social networking sites (SNS) during confinement. Furthermore, it was found that higher consumption was negatively correlated with the level of happiness, so that, people who reported greater well-being, both subjective and psychological, spent less time watching TV and using SNS. In contrast, no association was found between the level of happiness and the consumption of news (regardless of the media) and radio. Therefore, it seems that far from cultivating greater happiness, those who engaged in heavy consumption of TV entertainment and SNS during confinement were less happy than those who did so more moderately and spent more time using other media or performing other activities.","Muniz-Velazquez, J.

In this scenario, the drug repurposing approach is widely used for the rapid identification of potential drugs against SARS-CoV-2, considering viral and host factors. METHODS: We adopted a host transcriptome-based drug repurposing strategy utilizing the publicly available high throughput gene expression data on SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infection viruses. Based on the consistency in expression status of host factors in different cell types and previous evidence reported in the literature, pro-viral factors of SARS-CoV-2 identified and subject to drug repurposing analysis based on DrugBank and Connectivity Map (CMap) using the web tool, CLUE. RESULTS: The upregulated pro-viral factors such as TYMP, PTGS2, C1S, CFB, IFI44, XAF1, CXCL2, and CXCL3 were identified in early infection models of SARS-CoV-2. By further analysis of the drug-perturbed expression profiles in the connectivity map, 27 drugs that can reverse the expression of pro-viral factors were identified, and importantly, twelve of them reported to have anti-viral activity. The direct inhibition of the PTGS2 gene product can be considered as another therapeutic strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection and could suggest six approved PTGS2 inhibitor drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. The computational study could propose candidate repurposable drugs against COVID-19, and further experimental studies are required for validation.","Loganathan, Tamizhini; Ramachandran, Srimathy; Shankaran, Prakash; Nagarajan, Devipriya; Mohan S, Suma",PeerJ,598,16
