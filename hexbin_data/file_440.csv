4337,A pilot randomized controlled trial of 7 versus 14 days of antibiotic treatment for bloodstream infection on non-intensive care versus intensive care wards,2020-01-15,"BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment duration for patients with bloodstream infection is understudied. The Bacteremia Antibiotic Length Actually Needed for Clinical Effectiveness (BALANCE) pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) determined that it was feasible to enroll and randomize intensive care unit (ICU) patients with bloodstream infection to 7 versus 14 days of treatment, and served as the vanguard for the ongoing BALANCE main RCT. We performed this BALANCE-Ward pilot RCT to examine the feasibility and impact of potentially extending the BALANCE main RCT to include patients hospitalized on non-ICU wards. METHODS: We conducted an open pilot RCT among a subset of six sites participating in the ongoing BALANCE RCT, randomizing patients with positive non-Staphylococcus aureus blood cultures on non-ICU wards to 7 versus 14 days of antibiotic treatment. The co-primary feasibility outcomes were recruitment rate and adherence to treatment duration protocol. We compared feasibility outcomes, patient/pathogen characteristics, and overall outcomes among those enrolled in this BALANCE-Ward and prior BALANCE-ICU pilot RCTs. We estimated the sample size and non-inferiority margin impacts of expanding the BALANCE main RCT to include non-ICU patients. RESULTS: A total of 134 patients were recruited over 47 site-months (mean 2.9 patients/site-month, median 1.0, range 0.1–4.4 patients/site-month). The overall recruitment rate exceeded the BALANCE-ICU pilot RCT (mean 1.10 patients/site-month, p < 0.0001). Overall protocol adherence also exceeded the adherence in the BALANCE-ICU pilot RCT (125/134, 93% vs 89/115, 77%, p = 0.0003). BALANCE-Ward patients were older, with lower Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, and higher proportions of infections caused by Escherichia coli and genito-urinary sources of bloodstream infection. The BALANCE-Ward pilot RCT patients had an overall 90-day mortality rate of 17/133 (12.8%), which was comparable to the 90-day mortality rate in the ICU pilot RCT (17/115, 14.8%) (p = 0.65). Simulation models indicated there would be minimal sample size and non-inferiority margin implications of expanding enrolment to increasing proportions of non-ICU versus ICU patients. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to enroll non-ICU patients in a trial of 7 versus 14 days of antibiotics for bloodstream infection, and expanding the BALANCE RCT hospital-wide has the potential to improve the timeliness and generalizability of trial results.

4641,The influence of time to adrenaline administration in the Paramedic 2 randomised controlled trial,2020-01-07,"Although mechanical ventilation may be a patient’s vital ally during acute illness, it can quickly transform into an enemy during chronic conditions. The weaning process is the fundamental phase that enables the resumption of physiological respiratory function; however, it is also associated with a number of life-threatening complications, and a large percentage of critically ill patients never achieve airway device removal or require the resumption of mechanical ventilation just a few days post-weaning. Indeed, the weaning process is, at present, more of an art than a science. As such, there is urgent need for novel contributions from the scientific literature to abate the growing rates of morbidity and mortality associated with weaning failure. The physician attempting to wean a patient must integrate clinical parameters and common-sense criteria. Numerous studies have striven to identify single predictive factors of weaning failure and sought to standardize the weaning process, but the results are characterized by remarkable heterogeneity. Despite the lack of benchmarks, it is clear that the analysis of respiratory function must include a detailed overview of the five situations described below rather than a single aspect. The purpose of this two-part review is to provide a comprehensive description of these situations to clarify the “arena” physicians are entering when weaning critically ill patients from mechanical ventilation.","Vetrugno, Luigi; Guadagnin, Giovanni Maria; Brussa, Alessandro; Orso, Daniele; Garofalo, Eugenio; Bruni, Andrea; Longhini, Federico; Bove, Tiziana",Ultrasound J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7067937/,440

11252,Distinction between good palliative care and intending death,2019-10-28,"PURPOSE: To explore the role of vacuum assisted closure (VAC) therapy versus conventional dressings in the Fournier’s gangrene wound therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective multi-institutional cohort study. Data of 92 patients from nine centers between 2007 and 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. After surgery, patient having a local or a disseminated FG were managed with VAC therapy or with conventional dressings. The 10-weeks wound closure cumulative rate and OS were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 92 patients, 62 (67.4%) showed local and 30 (32.6%) a disseminated FG. After surgery, 19 patients (20.7%) with local and 14 (15.2%) with disseminated FG underwent to VAC therapy; 43 (46.7%) with local and 16 (17.4%) with disseminated FG were treated using conventional dressings. The multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the VAC in patients with disseminated FG led to a higher cumulative rate of wound closure than patients treated with no-VAC (OR = 6.5; 95% CI 1.1–37.4, p = 0.036). The Kaplan–Meier survival curves for the OS showed a significant difference between no-VAC patients with local and disseminated FG (OS rate at 90 days 0.90, 95% CI 0.71–0.97 vs 0.55, 95% CI 0.24–0.78, respectively; p = 0.039). Cox regression confirmed that no-VAC patients with disseminated FG showed the lowest OS (hazard ratio adjusted for sex and age HR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.1–10.4; p = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort study, VAC therapy in patients with disseminated FG may offer an advantage in terms of 10-weeks wound closure cumulative rate and OS at 90 days after initial surgery.","Iacovelli, Valerio; Cipriani, Chiara; Sandri, Marco; Filippone, Roberta; Ferracci, Antonella; Micali, Salvatore; Rocco, Bernardo; Puliatti, Stefano; Ferrarese, Paolo; Benedetto, Giuseppe; Minervini, Andrea; Cocci, Andrea; Pastore, Antonio Luigi; Al Salhi, Yazan; Antonelli, Alessandro; Morena, Tonino; Volpe, Alessandro; Poletti, Filippo; Celia, Antonio; Zeccolini, Guglielmo; Leonardo, Costantino; Proietti, Flavia; Finazzi Agrò, Enrico; Bove, Pierluigi",World J Urol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223519/,440

A critical look at COVID-19 pathophysiology,2020-05-18,"Changes are occurring within Brazilian institutes of higher education; currently several universities are reviewing their course offerings and teaching approaches to determine if they meet the needs of today's undergraduate students. When changes are made to the curriculum of experimental courses, there should be an understood guarantee that all efforts to avoid ethical and biosafety issues have been diligently considered. Ethical considerations lead us to create an alternative experimental session to be conducted that eliminated the use of rats, the conventional in vivo model employed for learning metabolism of glycogen in our university. To avoid possible biosafety issues, we prepared an alternative sample to simulate human urine, which we called guarurine. Using our new method, it is possible to verify positive results imitating a diabetic and starving people samples for detection of glucose and ketone. The alternative tool described herein is not only particularly suited to bypass the ethics of using animals for teaching, but also permits the discussion of significant aspects of pathological and physiological situations such as diabetics and starvation in a simple, safe, and interesting way.","Loureiro, Natália I.

15062,Keep calm and carry on: Anger management on the intensive care unit,2020-11-26,"The superoxide-generating Nox2 (NADPH oxidase-2) is expressed in multiple cell types. Previous studies demonstrated distinct roles for cardiomyocyte, endothelial cell, and leukocyte cell Nox2 in ANG II (angiotensin II)–induced cardiovascular remodeling. However, the in vivo role of fibroblast Nox2 remains unclear. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We developed a novel mouse model with inducible fibroblast-specific deficiency of Nox2 (fibroblast-specific Nox2 knockout or Fibro-Nox2KO mice) and investigated the responses to chronic ANG II stimulation. Fibro-Nox2KO mice showed no differences in basal blood pressure or vessel wall morphology, but the hypertensive response to ANG II infusion (1.1 mg/[kg·day] for 14 days) was substantially reduced as compared to control Nox2-Flox littermates. This was accompanied by a significant attenuation of aortic and resistance vessel remodeling. The conditioned medium of ANG II–stimulated primary fibroblasts induced a significant increase in vascular smooth muscle cell growth, which was inhibited by the short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of fibroblast Nox2. Mass spectrometric analysis of the secretome of ANG II–treated primary fibroblasts identified GDF6 (growth differentiation factor 6) as a potential growth factor that may be involved in these effects. Recombinant GDF6 induced a concentration-dependent increase in vascular smooth muscle cell growth while chronic ANG II infusion in vivo significantly increased aortic GDF6 protein levels in control mice but not Fibro-Nox2KO animals. Finally, silencing GDF6 in fibroblasts prevented the induction of vascular smooth muscle cell growth by fibroblast-conditioned media in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that fibroblast Nox2 plays a crucial role in the development of ANG II–induced vascular remodeling and hypertension in vivo. Mechanistically, fibroblast Nox2 may regulate paracrine signaling to medial vascular smooth muscle cells via factors, such as GDF6.","Harrison, Craig B.; Trevelin, Silvia Cellone; Richards, Daniel A.; Santos, Celio X.C.; Sawyer, Greta; Markovinovic, Andrea; Zhang, Xiaohong; Zhang, Min; Brewer, Alison C.; Yin, Xiaoke; Mayr, Manuel; Shah, Ajay M.",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7837692/,440
15413,Development and evaluation of an interactive web-based decision-making programme on relapse management for people with multiple sclerosis (POWER@MS2)—study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,2021-02-14,"Sexual reproduction often leads to selection that favors the evolution of sex-limited traits or sex-specific variation for shared traits. These sexual dimorphisms manifest due to sex-specific genetic architectures and sex-biased gene expression across development, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying these patterns are largely unknown. The first step is to understand how sexual dimorphisms arise across the genotype–phenotype–fitness map. The emergence of “4D genome technologies” allows for efficient, high-throughput, and cost-effective manipulation and observations of this process. Studies of sexual dimorphism will benefit from combining these technological advances (e.g., precision genome editing, inducible transgenic systems, and single-cell RNA sequencing) with clever experiments inspired by classic designs (e.g., bulked segregant analysis, experimental evolution, and pedigree tracing). This perspective poses a synthetic view of how manipulative approaches coupled with cutting-edge observational methods and evolutionary theory are poised to uncover the molecular genetic basis of sexual dimorphism with unprecedented resolution. We outline hypothesis-driven experimental paradigms for identifying genetic mechanisms of sexual dimorphism among tissues, across development, and over evolutionary time.","Kasimatis, Katja R; Sánchez-Ramírez, Santiago; Stevenson, Zachary C",Genome Biol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883666/,440
16030,Response to “Protecting the role of the intensive care research coordinator during pandemics”,2021-03-09,"BACKGROUND: Written clinical communication regarding patients’ disease understanding and values may facilitate goal-concordant care, yet little is known about the quality of electronic health record (EHR) documentation. We sought to (1) describe frequency of communication best practices in EHR-documented goals-of-care discussions, and (2) assess whether templated notes improve quality of documentation. METHODS: Researchers pulled text of EHR-documented goals-of-care discussions for hospitalized patients with Stage IV cancer from admission to 60-days follow-up. Text was included when in a single encounter the clinician addressed: (a) prognosis and/or illness understanding; and (b) goals and/or treatment options. Researchers qualitatively coded text based on guidelines for communication best practices, and noted if an EHR template was used. RESULTS: Forty-two percent (206/492) of patients had EHR-documented goals-of-care discussions. Text frequently described communication of cancer progression (89%), though rarely included prognosis (22%). Text often included patients’ goals and values (83%), and at least on specific treatment decision (82%). Communication about treatments was included for 98% of patients; common examples included cancer treatment (62%), hospice (62%), resuscitation (51%), or intensive care (38%). Clinicians documented making recommendations for 40% of patients. Text addressing patient emotional and spiritual concerns was uncommon (15%). Compared to free text, use of a template was associated with increased documentation of goals and values (80% vs. 61%, p < 0.01), but not other best practices. CONCLUSION: Insights from the study can be used to guide future training and research to study and improve the quality of documentation about goal of care, and its impact on goal-concordant care.","Ernecoff, Natalie C.; Wessell, Kathryn L.; Wood, William A.; Winzelberg, Gary S.; Collichio, Frances A.; Hanson, Laura C.",BMC Palliat Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7944465/,440

However, little is known about the interactions of acute inflammatory responses and the cardiovascular system. We therefore aimed to evaluate effects of acute inflammatory stimuli mediated by LPS administration on a set of 89 cardiovascular biomarkers. A single-blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over study using the human endotoxin model was performed. Ten healthy men were administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or placebo on two different study days after an overnight fast. Eighty-nine different cardiovascular biomarkers were measured repetitively over 48 h. Out of 89 cardiovascular biomarkers, 54 markers were significantly influenced by LPS infusion. The observed biomarker response to inflammation was more pronounced and complex than anticipated. In conclusion, our data show that the cardiovascular system is under enormous distress in response to experimental low-dose inflammation in humans, as demonstrated by a significant effect on 54 of the 89 biomarkers tested.","Resl, Michael; Heinzl, Matthias Wolfgang; Klammer, Carmen; Egger, Margot; Feldbauer, Roland; Pohlhammer, Johannes; Dieplinger, Benjamin; Clodi, Martin",J Cardiovasc Transl Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7983963/,440

The development of T1D goes through three stages, which can vary in duration from individual to individual. Late diagnosis or incorrect interpretation of the symptoms leads to the life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis, from which every third child in Germany suffers at the manifestation of T1D. Diabetes that manifests in adulthood is regularly misclassified and treated, at least initially, as type 2 diabetes. There are no fundamental differences in the insulin therapy of T1D in children, adolescents and adults. The use of insulin pump therapy and continuous glucose monitoring is steadily increasing with the aim of reducing the number and duration of hypo- and hyperglycemic episodes, increasing the time in range between 70–180 mg/dl (3,9–10 mmol/l) and reaching the treatment goal of an HbA1c below 7% (53 mmol/mol). In addition to the prevention of diabetes-related long-term microvascular complications, the timely detection and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors is of extraordinary importance also for young people with T1D.","Kordonouri, Olga; Kerner, Wolfgang",Internist (Berl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8024935/,440

Here we review evidence that experiences associated with childhood SES affect not only the outcome but also the pace of brain development. We argue that higher childhood SES is associated with protracted structural brain development and a prolonged trajectory of functional network segregation, ultimately leading to more efficient cortical networks in adulthood. We hypothesize that greater exposure to chronic stress accelerates brain maturation, whereas greater access to novel positive experiences decelerates maturation. We discuss the impact of variation in the pace of brain development on plasticity and learning.

17619,Determinants of healthcare worker turnover in intensive care units: A micro-macro multilevel analysis,2021-05-14,"BACKGROUND: One of the most widely used coaching models is Supportive Accountability (SA) which aims to provide intervention users with clear expectations for intervention use, regular monitoring, and a sense that coaches are trustworthy, benevolent, and have domain expertise. However, few measures exist to study the role of the SA model on coached digital interventions. We developed the Supportive Accountability Inventory (SAI) and evaluated the underlying factor structure and psychometric properties of this brief self-report measure. METHOD: Using data from a two-arm randomized trial of a remote intervention for major depressive disorder (telephone CBT [tCBT] or a stepped care model of web-based CBT [iCBT] and tCBT), we conducted an Exploratory Factor Analysis on the SAI item pool and explored the final SAI's relationship to iCBT engagement as well as to depression outcomes. Participants in our analyses (n = 52) included those randomized to a receive iCBT, but were not stepped up to tCBT due to insufficient response to iCBT, had not remitted prior to the 10-week assessment point, and completed the pool of 8 potential SAI items. RESULTS: The best fitting EFA model included only 6 items from the original pool of 8 and contained two factors: Monitoring and Expectation. Final model fit was mixed, but acceptable (χ(2)(4) = 5.24, p = 0.26; RMSR = 0.03; RMSEA = 0.091; TLI = 0.967). Internal consistency was acceptable at α = 0.68. The SAI demonstrated good convergent and divergent validity. The SAI at the 10-week/mid-treatment mark was significantly associated with the number of days of iCBT use (r = 0.29, p = .037), but, contrary to expectations, was not predictive of either PHQ-9 scores (F(2,46) = 0.14, p = .89) or QIDS-C scores (F(2,46) = 0.84, p = .44) at post-treatment. CONCLUSION: The SAI is a brief measure of the SA framework constructs. Continued development to improve the SAI and expand the constructs it assesses is necessary, but the SAI represents the first step towards a measure of a coaching protocol that can support both coached digital mental health intervention adherence and improved outcomes.","Meyerhoff, Jonah; Haldar, Shefali; Mohr, David C.",Internet Interv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8122167/,440

Preparation and evaluation of vaccines in laboratory animals is an important preliminary step toward prevention and control of the disease. Here, virus-like particles (VLPs) of APPV were prepared and VLPs vaccine was evaluated in BALB/c mice. Purified E(rns) and E2 proteins expressed in E. coli were allowed to self-assemble into VLPs, which had the appearance of hollow spherical particles with a diameter of about 100 nm by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The VLPs induced strong antibody responses and reduced the viral load in tissues of BALB/c mice. The data from animal challenge experiments, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that BALB/c mice are an appropriate laboratory model for APPV. These results suggest the feasibility of using VLPs as a vaccine for the prevention and control of APPV and provide useful information for further study of APPV in laboratory animals.","Liu, Jianxin; Zhang, Pengtao; Chen, Yongjie; Zhong, Wenxia; Li, Baojian; Pi, Molin; Ning, Zhangyong",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8317679/,440

However, in nature, coinfections are common, and infection with one organism can alter host susceptibility to infection with another. Helminth parasites share a long coevolutionary history with mammalian hosts and have shaped host physiology, metabolism, immunity, and the composition of the microbiome. Published studies suggest that helminth infection can either be beneficial or detrimental during viral infection. Here, we discuss coinfection studies in mouse models and use them to define key determinants that impact outcomes, including the type of antiviral immunity, the tissue tropism of both the helminth and the virus, and the timing of viral infection in relation to the helminth lifecycle. We also explore the current mechanistic understanding of how helminth-virus coinfection impacts host immunity and viral pathogenesis. While much attention has been placed on the impact of the gut bacterial microbiome on immunity to infection, we suggest that enteric helminths, as a part of the eukaryotic macrobiome, also represent an important modulator of disease pathogenesis and severity following virus infection.","Desai, Pritesh; Diamond, Michael S.; Thackray, Larissa B.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8405156/,440
22117,The REMDACTA trial: do interleukin receptor antagonists provide additional benefit in COVID-19?,2021-10-07,"Planning forest management relies on predicting insect outbreaks such as mountain pine beetle, particularly in the intermediate‐term future, e.g., 5‐year. Machine‐learning algorithms are potential solutions to this challenging problem due to their many successes across a variety of prediction tasks. However, there are many subtle challenges in applying them: identifying the best learning models and the best subset of available covariates (including time lags) and properly evaluating the models to avoid misleading performance‐measures. We systematically address these issues in predicting the chance of a mountain pine beetle outbreak in the Cypress Hills area and seek models with the best performance at predicting future 1‐, 3‐, 5‐ and 7‐year infestations. We train nine machine‐learning models, including two generalized boosted regression trees (GBM) that predict future 1‐ and 3‐year infestations with 92% and 88% AUC, and two novel mixed models that predict future 5‐ and 7‐year infestations with 86% and 84% AUC, respectively. We also consider forming the train and test datasets by splitting the original dataset randomly rather than using the appropriate year‐based approach and show that this may obtain models that score high on the test dataset but low in practice, resulting in inaccurate performance evaluations. For example, a k‐nearest neighbor model with the actual performance of 68% AUC, scores the misleadingly high 78% on a test dataset obtained from a random split, but the more accurate 66% on a year‐based split. We then investigate how the prediction accuracy varies with respect to the provided history length of the covariates and find that neural network and naive Bayes, predict more accurately as history‐length increases, particularly for future 1‐ and 3‐year predictions, and roughly the same holds with GBM. Our approach is applicable to other invasive species. The resulting predictors can be used in planning forest and pest management and planning sampling locations in field studies.","Ramazi, Pouria; Kunegel‐Lion, Mélodie; Greiner, Russell; Lewis, Mark A.",Ecol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8495826/,440
24365,Endemic mycosis,2005,"Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage[DAH] is a serious condition that can be life threatening. It can be caused by a constellation of disorders which presents with hemoptysis, anemia, and diffuse alveolar infiltrates. Respiratory failure from DAH can be so severe that it has been called an ARDS mimic/imitator. Early recognition is crucial because prompt diagnosis and treatment are required for survival. DAH should be distinguished from other causes of pulmonary hemorrhage caused by localized pulmonary abnormalities and the bronchial circulation. Early bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is generally required to confirm the diagnosis of DAH and rule out infection. Progressively bloody bronchoalveolar lavage samples can distinguish DAH. Systemic vasculitis is one of the most common causes of DAH and can be pathologically defined by the presence of cellular inflammation, vessel destruction, tissue necrosis, and eventually, organ dysfunction. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents remain the gold standard for the treatment. The following case illustrates a patient who was dependent on dialysis, then presented with hemoptysis. Bronchoscopy demonstrated progressively bloody bronchoalveolar lavage samples consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Serologic testing was consistent with microscopic polyangiitis.

Based on a general estimate of the cost, we demonstrate the procedure for the calculation of the optimal set of parameters in our isolation and quarantine strategy through numerical simulation on a model social network. We find an important parameter π which is a combination of several general parameters for the SIR model so that when π> 0, the isolation and quarantine strategy will fail to contain the outbreak.

A systematic search was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines to identify relevant studies in the electronic databases of PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, and Web of Sciences from January 1, 2020 to March 27, 2020 using search terms in the titles and abstracts. Based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria, 762 articles were screened. Finally, 15 eligible articles which had adequate data on chest CT findings of COVID-19-infected patients were enrolled in this systematic review. RESULTS: In pediatric patients (15 years old or younger), peripheral distribution was found in 100% of cases, ground glass opacities (GGO) in 55.2%, bilateral involvement in 50%, halo sign in 50%, unilateral involvement in 30%, consolidation in 22.2%, crazy paving pattern in 20%, nodular opacities in 15%, pleural effusion in 4.2%, lymphadenopathy in none, and normal imaging in 20.8% of cases. On the other hand, in adult patients, bilateral involvement was reported in 76.8%, GGO in 68.4%, peripheral distribution in 62.2%, mixed GGO and consolidation in 48.7%, consolidation in 33.7%, crazy paving pattern in 27.7%, mixed central and peripheral distribution in 25.0%, unilateral involvement in 15.2%, nodular opacities in 9.2%, pleural effusion in 5.5%, central distribution of lesions in 5.4%, lymphadenopathy in 2.4%, and normal imaging in 9.8% of cases. CONCLUSION: According to the findings of this systematic review, children infected with COVID-19 can present with normal or atypical findings (nodular opacities/unilateral involvement) in chest imaging more frequently than adult patients. Therefore, more caution should be taken to avoid misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis in infected children. Besides, clinical and laboratory findings need to be considered more decision-making for pediatric patients with normal or atypical chest CT scan but high suspicion of COVID-19.","Azadbakht, Javid; Haghi-Aminjan, Hamed; Farhood, Bagher",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7400749/,440

Budesonide when added to surfactant decreased lung and systemic inflammation from mechanical ventilation in preterm lambs and decreased the rates and severity of BPD in preterm infants. We hypothesized that the addition of budesonide to surfactant will decrease the injury from mechanical ventilation in preterm lambs exposed to intra-amniotic (IA) lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODS: Lambs at 126 ± 1 day GA received LPS 10 mg IA 48 h prior to injurious mechanical ventilation. After 15 min, lambs received either surfactant mixed with: (1) saline or (2) Budesonide 0.25 mg/kg, then ventilated with normal tidal volumes for 4 h. Injury markers in the lung, liver, and brain were compared. RESULTS: Compared with surfactant alone, the addition of budesonide improved blood pressures, dynamic compliance, and ventilation, while decreasing mRNA for pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lung, liver, and multiple areas of the brain. LPS caused neuronal activation and structural changes in the brain that were not altered by budesonide. Budesonide was not retained within the lung beyond 4 h. CONCLUSIONS: In preterm lambs exposed to IA LPS, the addition of budesonide to surfactant improved physiology and markers of lung and systemic inflammation. IMPACT: The addition of budesonide to surfactant decreases the lung and systemic responses to injurious mechanical ventilation preterm lambs exposed to fetal LPS. Budesonide was present in the plasma by 15 min and the majority of the budesonide is no longer in the lung at 4 h of ventilation. IA LPS and mechanical ventilation caused structural changes in the brain that were not altered by short-term exposure to budesonide. The budesonide dose of 0.25 mg/kg being used clinically seems likely to decrease lung inflammation in preterm infants with chorioamnionitis.","Hillman, Noah H.; Kemp, Matthew W.; Fee, Erin; Rittenschober-Böhm, Judith; Royse, Emily; Abugisisa, Leenah; Salomone, Fabrizio; Musk, Gabrielle C.; Jobe, Alan H.",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7657068/,440

While the deployment of host resistance in crops is the most efficient means to control various viruses, host resistance itself can act as strong selective pressure and thus play a critical role in the evolution of virus virulence. Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), a plant RNA virus with high evolutionary capacity, has caused endemic disease in various crops worldwide, including pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), because of frequent emergence of resistance-breaking variants. In this study, we examined the molecular and evolutionary characteristics of recently emerged, resistance-breaking CMV variants infecting pepper. Our population genetics analysis revealed that the high divergence capacity of CMV RNA1 might have played an essential role in the host-interactive evolution of CMV and in shaping the CMV population structure in pepper. We also demonstrated that nonsynonymous mutations in RNA1 encoding the 1a protein enabled CMV to overcome the deployed resistance in pepper. Our findings suggest that resistance-driven selective pressures on RNA1 might have contributed in shaping the unique evolutionary pattern of CMV in pepper. Therefore, deployment of a single resistance gene may reduce resistance durability against CMV and more integrated approaches are warranted for successful control of CMV in pepper.","Heo, Kyeong-Jae; Kwon, Sun-Jung; Kim, Mi-Kyeong; Kwak, Hae-Ryun; Han, Soo-Jung; Kwon, Min-Jun; Rao, A L N; Seo, Jang-Kyun",Virus Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7673075/,440

Loss of continuum of care along with improper lifestyle was expected to worsen glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We aimed to identify the effects of lockdown on their glycemic status, lifestyle changes and psychosocial health. Methods: The pre- and post-lockdown data of 110 adults with T2D who were under regular follow up was collected by direct interview during their visit to the diabetes clinic. The variables analyzed included demographic data, HbA1c, body weight, lifestyle changes, psychosocial factors and use of technology. Result: The overall physical activity had dipped significantly accounting to lockdown restrictions and fear. Dietary adherence was better with participants exhibiting increased consumption of vegetables (80.9%), fruits (42.7%), and decreased unhealthy snacking (63%). 90% of them had access to medications during lockdown. There was significant change noted in the mean HbA1c (0.9- 1.45%) and body weight (1–3.5kgs) before and after lockdown. There was a great increase in Screen time attributing to Work from home and restrictions to move out. 63.6% of them spent time with their family members. Those with prior mental stress,poor sleep and unhealthy dietary habits had worsening glycemic control as seen in those with less physical activity and an unhealthy diet. An increasing trend of utilisation of health related mobile internet technology apps were noted. Conclusion: Lockdown did cause a major change in the overall glycemic control. Measures to promote healthy lifestyle practices along with ways to reduce psychosocial stress must be implemented for better T2D management during such restricted times. Telemedicine paved a greater way and scope of continuum of Diabetes care.","Selvarajan, Raja; Jaganmohan, Balaji; Vijayaraghavan, Radhika",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090074/,440

Governments have often played loose with their state's constitution in the name of warding off an urgent threat. But after decades of increasing interconnectedness and emerging transnational governance, today one sees new forms of emergency politics that are cross-border in range. From the European Union to the World Health Organization, from supranational institutions to state governments acting in concert, the logic of emergency is embraced in international contexts, with Covid-19 the latest occasion. This Forum offers an entry-point into this emerging phenomenon. Taking as its point of departure two recent books, it examines the origins, forms, effects and normative stakes of emergency politics beyond the state. Among the matters discussed are the concept of emergency politics, the historical context of its contemporary forms, the patterns of decision-making associated with it, the implications for the legitimacy of transnational institutions, and the constitutional and political ways in which it might be contained. Transnational emergency politics seems likely to remain a central feature of the coming years, and our aim is to further its study in international relations.","Heupel, Monika; Koenig-Archibugi, Mathias; Kreuder-Sonnen, Christian; Patberg, Markus; Séville, Astrid; Steffek, Jens; White, Jonathan",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194961/,440

We advanced from a one-compartmental design of the stomach to a much more appropriate, multi-compartmental 'mixing tank' gastric model that reflects drug distribution along the different regions of the stomach as a consequence of randomly dosing relative to the different contractile phases of the migrating motor complex (MMC). To capture the intraluminal phenol red concentrations in the different segments of the GI tract both in fasted and fed state conditions, it was essential to include a bypass flow compartment ('magenstrasse') to facilitate the transport of the phenol red solution directly to the duodenum (fasted state) or antrum (fed state). The fasted and fed state models were validated with external reference data from an independent aspiration study using another nonabsorbable marker (paromomycin). These results will be essential for the development and optimization of computational programs for GI simulation and absorption prediction, providing a realistic gastric physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model based on direct measurement of gastric concentrations of the drug in the stomach.","Paixão, Paulo; Bermejo, Marival; Hens, Bart; Tsume, Yasuhiro; Dickens, Joseph; Shedden, Kerby; Salehi, Niloufar; Koenigsknecht, Mark J; Baker, Jason R; Hasler, William L; Lionberger, Robert; Fan, Jianghong; Wysocki, Jeffrey; Wen, Bo; Lee, Allen; Frances, Ann; Amidon, Gregory E; Yu, Alex; Benninghoff, Gail; Löbenberg, Raimar; Talattof, Arjang; Sun, Duxin; Amidon, Gordon L",European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpb.2018.05.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29857136/,440

However, the progress of embracing genetics and genomics into nursing discipline is limited. One of the main barriers is lack of understanding on the relevancy of genetics and genomics to nursing discipline. Objectives This paper aims to synthesize and develop a theoretical framework for the interaction of nursing discipline with genetics and genomics. Methods Through content analysis and constant comparative method, a theoretical framework was developed from synthesis of the studies regarding nursing and genetics/genomics indexed in multiple English and Chinese databases. Results Four main theoretical statements were constructed in the framework: 1) There are three ways to show how genetics and genomics can influence nursing discipline: a new specialty, new technologies and a new lens; 2) The significant contribution of nursing discipline to genetics and genomics lies in how nurses could focus on the association between human responses and genes and how nurses could advocate for their clients in the genetic and genomic era; 3) A paradigm shift occurs after a constant interaction of nursing discipline with genetics and genomics; 4) Implementation strategies could be used to facilitate the integration of genetics and genomics to nursing discipline and advance the paradigm shift. Conclusions The framework will help to understand the relationship between nursing discipline and genetics and genomics and implicate the future studies integrating genetics and genomic science into nursing discipline.","Hu, Jiale; Yu, Leilei; Modanloo, Shokoufeh; Zhou, Yiyan; Yang, Yan",International journal of nursing sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnss.2018.08.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406845/,440

Immune regulation plays a key role in anti-tumour therapy. The present study explored the anti-tumour effect of ESPs released by Angiostrongylus cantonensis. In Hepa1-6 mouse tumour models, ESPs significantly reduced tumour growth. Tumour-bearing mice treated with ESPs had significantly higher CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell counts than those treated with Freund's adjuvant. In vitro, human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells, human lung cancer A549 cells, and normal human liver HL-7702 cells were co-incubated with ESPs for 24 h and 48 h. ESPs significantly accelerated HepG2 apoptosis but had no inhibitory effect on the proliferation of A549 and HL-7702 cells. Apoptotic HepG2 cells displayed condensed nuclei, apoptotic bodies, and swollen endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related factors activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) in HepG2 cells increased with increasing ESP concentration and treatment time. Calreticulin (CRT) is a key effector protein of ESPs, and recombinant calreticulin (rCRT) was produced in BL21 Escherichia coli (E. coli). In contrast to ESPs, rCRT markedly reduced the proliferation of HepG2 cells. The expression levels of ATF6 and CHOP in HepG2 cells treated with 30 μg/mL rCRT significantly increased at 48 h. Notably, these findings synergistically suggest that ESPs and rCRT are promising candidates for anti-tumour immunotherapy.","Lu, Yajun; Yang, Yuxiao; Yang, Siqi; Xia, Qianfeng",Parasitology research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00436-020-06872-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901341/,440

Acyclovir is indicated to minimize clinical manifestations with the suspected of viral association (HHV-6 and 7). Another group of the human herpesvirus family (HHV-1 and 2), causes herpes simplex that is controlled with the antivirals, including acyclovir, as well as the amino acid L-Lysine, both showing positive and similar results in reducing the number of annual manifestations and the healing time of the lesions. The aim of this study is to report a case of PR in a child, to review the literature on the etiopathogenesis of the disease and on the effects of L-Lysine as well as another amino acid in the treatment. An 11-year-old girl, phototype II, presented lesions diagnosed as PR. The cycle would be 6 to 8 weeks on average. A solution of L-Lysine was prescribed for thirty days, on an empty stomach. After the fourth day of therapy, the cycle of new eruptions was interrupted, initial lesions regressed, accelerating the repair of larger lesions resulting in an improvement of the clinical condition. We concluded that the administration of L-Lysine, in therapeutic doses, can be a safe alternative for the PR control. This article is protected by copyright.

Limited data are available about the incidence of HBoV in Egyptian children. We aimed to investigate the association of HBoV genotypes in children with diarrheal disease and also to determine the possibility of HBoV co-infections with other human enteric pathogens. METHODS A total of 102 stool samples were collected from children under five years old with diarrhea. Samples were analyzed for the presence of HBoV by real-time PCR. HBoV positive samples were tested for adenovirus (AdV), rotavirus (RoV), parasitic helminths, and enteric protozoa. RESULTS HBoV was detected in 58% of examined cases. HBoV-3 was the most prevalent genotype observed (44%; 45 of 102), followed by HBoV-2/4 (33%; 34 of 102) and HBoV-1 (30%; 31 of 102). Although the incidence of HBoV was higher in males (66.6%; 34 of 51) than females (49%; 25 of 51), the analysis showed no significant difference for HBoV between genders. The average HBoV concentrations were 5.3 × 104 GC/g in males and 1.03 × 105 GC/g in females. Among the HBoV-positive samples, the single infection of HBoV was 52.5% (31/59), while the co-infections with multiple viruses were found in 1.7% (1/59) for HBoV and AdV, 33.9% (20/59) for HBoV and RoV, and 11.9% (7/59) for HBoV, and RoV and AdV. No co-infection with parasitic helminths or enteric protozoa was found. CONCLUSIONS The single infection of HBoV in some children suffering from acute gastroenteritis indicated that HBoV could be the main etiologic agent of the disease. The study highlights the high incidence of HBoVs genotypes with remarkable multiple co-infections in the pre-school children in Egypt.","Rizk, Neveen M; Abd-Elmaksoud, Sherif; Farid, Tarek M; Abohashish, Maha M A; Al-Herrawy, Ahmad Z; Hamza, Ibrahim A",The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42506-021-00084-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34351553/,440

METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, we evaluated adults at the Cleveland Clinic Main Campus between 2005 and 2012, who had had available TSH concentrations within the 6 months before noncardiac surgery. Patients were categorized as (1) hypothyroid (patients who had diagnosis of hypothyroidism any time prior to surgery and increased TSH value (> 5.5 mIU/L) within 6 months prior to surgery); (2) treated (hypothyroid diagnosis and normal TSH concentrations [0.4-5.5 mIU/L]); and (3) euthyroid (no hypothyroid diagnosis and normal TSH concentrations). We conducted pairwise comparisons among the 3 groups using inverse propensity score weighting to control for observed confounding variables. Average relative effect generalized estimating equation model was used for the primary outcome composite of in-hospital cardiovascular morbidity, surgical wound complication or infection, and mortality. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression were used for secondary outcomes of intraoperative vasopressor use and duration of hospitalization, respectively. RESULTS We identified 800 hypothyroid patients (median TSH: 8.6 mIU/L [Q1, Q3: 6.5, 13.0]), 1805 treated patients (2.0 mIU/L [1.1, 3.2]), and 5612 euthyroid patients (1.7 mIU/L [1.1, 2.6]). There were no significant differences among the hypothyroid, treated, and euthyroid patients on the primary composite outcome (all P values ≥0.30). Hypothyroid patients were slightly more likely to receive vasopressor during surgery than either treated (odds ratio, 1.17; 99.2% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.36) or euthyroid (odds ratio, 1.12; 99.2% CI, 1.02-1.24) patients. Furthermore, hypothyroid patients were slightly but significantly less likely to be discharged at any given postoperative time than treated patients (hazard ratio, 0.92; 99.2% CI, 0.86-0.99). CONCLUSIONS Hypothyroidism was not associated with worse postoperative mortality, wound, or cardiovascular outcomes in noncardiac patients. Thus, postponing surgery to initiate thyroid replacement therapy in patients with hypothyroidism seems unnecessary.","Komatsu, Ryu; You, Jing; Mascha, Edward J; Sessler, Daniel I; Kasuya, Yusuke; Turan, Alparslan",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000000805; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26287300/,440

80971,Review article: Goals-of-care discussions for adult patients nearing end of life in emergency departments: A systematic review.,2019,"BACKGROUND The prevalence of obesity continues to rise, affecting nearly a third of Australian adults in 2017-18. The stigma and bias people with obesity (PwO) experience is one of the barriers hindering the dialogue between PwO and their Health Care Professionals (HCPs). The results from the ACTION IO Australian cohort are reported here. Identification of local barriers can inform strategies to improve access to quality obesity care within Australia. METHODS The ACTION-IO study was an online cross-sectional survey conducted in 11 countries during June-October 2018. In Australia 1,000 community based adult PwO (body mass index ≥30 kg/m based on self-reported height and weight) and 200 HCPs involved with direct patient care (seeing ≥10 patients with obesity/month) completed the survey. RESULTS There was a mean delay of 8.9 years from when a PwO first started to struggle with their weight, and the initial discussion with an HCP about this. HCPs acknowledged weight loss efforts in only 38.5% of their patients, although 74.6% of PwO had attempted weight loss. Most PwO (82.0%) assumed full responsibility for their weight loss. HCPs identified short appointment times (60.5%) and the cost of obesity medication, programmes and services (58.5%) as barriers to weight management conversations and weight loss, respectively. Most PwO want their HCP to raise the issue of weight with 64 % reporting finding such conversations positive and helpful. CONCLUSION Compared to global results, Australian PwO took 3 years longer to seek medical care about their weight. Better recognition of obesity's impact and targeting barriers to care are needed.","Rigas, Georgia; Williams, Kathryn; Sumithran, Priya; Brown, Wendy A; Swinbourne, Jessica; Purcell, Katrina; Caterson, Ian D",Obesity research & clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orcp.2020.08.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888856/,440

We therefore ask how individual labor market experiences are related to the development of mental health complaints in the spring of 2020. As clinical data collection was compromised during the lockdowns, standardized surveys of the European labor force provide an opportunity to observe mental health complaints as the crisis unfolded. Data are representative of active members of the labor force of six European nations that contained varying levels of COVID-19 burdens in terms of mortality and lockdown measures. We document a steep occupational prestige level gradient on the probability of facing economic hardship during the lockdowns-looming job loss, income loss, and workload decline-which evidently exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities. Analyses indicate a striking positive relationship between instantaneous economic hardships during the COVID-19 lockdown and expressing feelings of depression and health anxiety. Importantly, the magnitude of the association between such hardships and indicators of mental health deterioration is highly dependent on workers' occupational standing, revealing a second layer of exacerbating inequality.","Witteveen, Dirk; Velthorst, Eva",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2009609117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33046648/,440

So far, cancer screening has been a causality of COVID-19; however, the opposite may transpire for self-sampling. Self-sampling enables socially distanced cervical screening with an outreach that extends to underserved populations. As evidence mounts that self-sampling is noninferior to clinician-taken samples, the focus for self-sampling is now as a primary screening option for all women. Now, we have evidence from a modeling study (using Australia as an exemplar) to suggest that program effectiveness with primary self-sampling would be better than the current program, even if sensitivity is lower. Regulatory issues, suitable triage strategies, and clear communication about self-sampling are hurdles yet to be overcome.

93248,"Assessing whether COVID-19 patients will benefit from critical care, and an objective approach to capacity challenges during a pandemic: An Intensive Care Society clinical guideline.",2021-08-01,"INTRODUCTION Topical treatment is the mainstay for mild or moderate psoriasis, but patients are generally little satisfied. Calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (Cal/BD) cutaneous foam has shown to improve signs and symptoms in plaque psoriasis patients. This study assessed patient's satisfaction with Cal/BD foam in a real-life Italian dermatological clinical practice. METHODS A multicenter, 4-week observational prospective cohort study enrolled, in 17 Italian dermatology clinics, adult patients with plaque psoriasis on the body and/or scalp. Treatment satisfaction was assessed by 9-item Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9), preference over previous treatments by Patient Preference Questionnaire (PPQ), and change in disease state by Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI). RESULTS Overall 256 patients were eligible, with a mean (SD) age of 55.6 (15.4) years, 59.4% were males. Psoriasis severity was mild in 52.0% of patients, moderate in 43.3%, and severe in 4.7%. Scalp involvement was present in 36.7% of patients. Previous antipsoriatic treatments had been received by 80.5% of patients. TSQM-9 median (25th-75th percentile) scores were 83.3 (66.7-88.9) for effectiveness, 77.8 (66.7-88.9) for convenience, and 78.6 (64.3-92.9) for global satisfaction. Mean (SD) PASI value decreased from 7.3 (4.8) to 2.1 (2.7) after 4 weeks. More than 90% of patients previously treated for psoriasis evaluated the Cal/BD foam more effective, easier to use and better tolerated compared to previous topical treatments at PPQ. CONCLUSIONS This observational study provides real-life evidence of a high level of satisfaction with effectiveness and convenience of the Cal/BD foam in a cohort of plaque psoriasis patients, with an objective improvement in PASI.

In this study, a bispecific anticarcinoembryonic antigen (CEACAM5; CD66e) × antihapten monoclonal antibody, TF2, was used in combination with a small (1.5 kD) peptide, IMP288, labeled with (111)In and (177)Lu. METHODS First, tumor uptake of (111)In-IMP288 and (177)Lu-IMP288, as determined by immuno-SPECT, was validated by ex vivo counting. Two groups of female BALB/c nude mice had LS174T tumors implanted in the peritoneal cavity. They received intravenous injections of TF2, followed by 10 MBq of (111)In-IMP288 or 90 MBq of (177)Lu-IMP288. A control group of non-tumor-bearing mice received TF2 and (111)In-IMP288. One hour after the radiolabeled IMP288 was given, small-animal SPECT/CT images were acquired, and subsequently animals were dissected. Furthermore, a survival study was performed in 3 groups of 10 mice with intraperitoneal tumors: mice received TF2 and (177)Lu-IMP288 (60 MBq), nonpretargeted (177)Lu-IMP288 (60 MBq), or phosphate-buffered saline. Immuno-SPECT scans were acquired directly after therapy and at 14 and 45 d after therapy. Tumor growth was analyzed in the successive scans in each animal. RESULTS (111)In- and (177)Lu-labeled IMP288 had similar in vivo distribution. The activity measured in the pretargeted immuno-SPECT images correlated well with the uptake measured in the dissected tumors (Pearson r = 0.99, P < 0.05). In the therapy study, the SPECT images showed rapid and selective tumor targeting with high tumor-to-background contrast (30 ± 12) as early as 1 h after injection. The successive images of the treated mice showed delayed tumor growth in the pretargeted radioimmunotherapy group, corresponding with their prolonged survival. CONCLUSION Pretargeted immuno-SPECT with TF2 and (111)In- or (177)Lu-IMP288 can be used to predict and confirm tumor targeting and monitor the therapeutic effect of pretargeted radioimmunotherapy.","Schoffelen, Rafke; van der Graaf, Winette T A; Sharkey, Robert M; Franssen, Gerben M; McBride, William J; Chang, Chien-Hsing; Bos, Desirée L; Goldenberg, David M; Oyen, Wim J G; Boerman, Otto C","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.112.106278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23081995/,440

METHODS National estimates were produced using weighting and imputation methods for a number of donors, donations, donor deferrals, autologous and directed donations and transfusions, PLT and plasma collections and transfusions, a number of crossmatch procedures, a number of units irradiated and leukoreduced, pediatric transfusions, and transfusion-associated adverse events. RESULTS Between 2017 and 2019, there was a slight decrease in successful donations by 1.1%. Donations by persons aged 16-18 decreased by 10.1% while donations among donors >65 years increased by 10.5%. From 2017 to 2019, the median price paid for blood components by hospitals for leukoreduced red blood cell units, leukoreduced apheresis PLT units, and for fresh frozen plasma units continued to decrease. The rate of life-threatening transfusion-related adverse reactions continued to decrease. Most whole blood/red blood cell units (97%) and PLT units (97%) were leukoreduced.

Little information is available on the biomechanical properties of these dermal substitutes after adequate incorporation as compared to normal skin. Determining parameters such as tensile strength in these skin substitutes will help us further understand their wound healing properties and potential in developing artificial tissue constructs. We hypothesize that a dermal substitute has a lower stress-strain curve and altered stress-induced deformation quantified with tensiometry and digital image speckle correlation (DISC) analysis. Two separate 5×10-cm full-thickness wounds were created on the dorsum of 3 female swine. Fibrin glue was applied before either a full-thickness skin graft (FTSG) or application of artificial dermal matrix. On day 42, cultured autologous keratinocytes were applied as a cell sheet to the wound covered with Integra. On day 56, the wounds were fully excised and fresh tissue specimens, including normal skin, were stored in a physiological solution and prepared for analysis. Rectangular samples were excised from the center of each specimen measuring 4×4×30 mm. Using a tensiometer and DISC analysis, we evaluated the tensile strength of 3 different groups of skin, namely, normal, FTSG, and Integra. There is a significant difference between the Integra specimen when compared to normal skin and FTSG. We found a minimal difference in the stress-strain curves of the latter two. Integra alone shows plastic deformation with continued stretching before ultimate midline fracture. There is significant change between the Young's moduli of the normal skin and the Integra, whereas there is little difference between the FTSG and the normal skin; DISC confirms this analysis. The normal skin and FTSG show a convergence of vectors to a linear plane, whereas Integra shows very little organization. Using 2 different methods of analysis, we have shown a dermal substitute does not display similar biomechanical properties after adequate incorporation. These major tensile strength differences are shown between normal, grafted, and Integra constructs under physiological conditions. These properties will lead to further understanding of artificial tissue and engineered constructs in laboratory and clinical applications.","Fritz, Jason R; Phillips, Brett T; Conkling, Nicole; Fourman, Mitchell; Melendez, Mark M; Bhatnagar, Divya; Simon, Marcia; Rafailovich, Miriam; Dagum, Alexander B",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0b013e31824a43b0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22868307/,440

A Qualitative Evidence Synthesis.,2019,"For the past several months, we have witnessed one of the greatest global health challenges experienced by humankind. This unprecedented COVID-19 viral pandemic, characterized by its enigmatic nature and bewildering spread, respects no borders and has nearly paralyzed healthcare systems throughout the world. Indeed, in the absence of specific, proven medical interventions, healthcare systems have been overwhelmed, thus limiting their ability to treat patients with non-emergent medical conditions and those awaiting elective procedures. Although it is beyond the scope of this editorial to discuss what constitutes a necessary or elective procedure, this radical change in medical practice has had an enormous impact on discontinuation of fertility care services, especially the assisted reproductive technologies (ART). It is eminently clear that reducing or discontinuing elective procedures and essential ART treatments was crucial not only to enable hospitals and medical facilities to manage (or to treat) the explosive rise in SARS-CoV-2 patients, but also to reduce disease transmission vis-à-vis various mitigating strategies-especially individual isolation and social distancing, strategies utilized effectively in China and Italy.","David, Adamson; Zev, Rosenwaks; Van Der Spuy, Zephne; Díaz Yamal, Ivonne",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418213/,440

Although mostly studied during control ventilation, it is increasingly appreciated that VILI and VIDD also occur during assisted ventilation. Hence, current research focuses on identifying ways to monitor and deliver protective ventilation in assisted modes. This review describes the operating principles of proportional modes of assist, their implications for lung and diaphragm protective ventilation, and the supporting clinical data. RECENT FINDINGS Proportional modes of assist, proportional assist ventilation, PAV, and neurally adjusted ventilatory assist, NAVA, deliver a pressure assist that is proportional to the patient's effort, enabling ventilation to be better controlled by the patient's brain. This control underlies the potential of proportional modes to avoid over-assist and under-assist, improve patient--ventilator interaction, and provide protective ventilation. Indeed, in clinical studies, proportional modes have been associated with reduced asynchronies, enhanced diaphragmatic recovery, and limitation of excessive tidal volume. Additionally, proportional modes facilitate better monitoring of the delivery of protective assisted ventilation. SUMMARY Physiological rationale and clinical data suggest a potential role for proportional modes of assist in providing and monitoring lung and diaphragm protective ventilation.","Vaporidi, Katerina",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31738231/,440

The most common etiologies are post-upper respiratory infection, nasal/sinus disease and head trauma. SUMMARY Procedures to diagnose olfactory disorders and to identify etiologies are available. Depending on etiology, certain types of treatment are often successful, such as endoscopic sinus surgery and corticosteroid administration in nasal/sinus disease. In post-upper respiratory infection and head trauma, spontaneous recovery is fairly high. In any case, it is advisable to counsel the patient with regards to strategies to cope with olfactory disorders.","Nordin, Steven; Brämerson, Annika",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aci.0b013e3282f3f473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18188011/,440

113324,COVID-Lung: The Battlefield.,2021-03-01,"Recent new zoonotic respiratory viruses have infected humans and led to severe acute respiratory syndrome: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), influenza A H5N1, influenza A H1N1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The first SARS-CoV outbreak took place in 2003, in Guangdong, China. A decade later, another pathogenic coronavirus, MERS-CoV caused an endemic in Middle Eastern countries. The latest pandemic coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) has been related to the newly isolated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). For the first time since the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the 1980s. Dentistry is facing a new turning point. This critical review aims to discuss the impact of COVID-19 infection on oral health care. In dental practice COVID-19 patients are the main source of infection and symptomatic patients are more contagious. Dentists can be first line of diagnosis of the disease, as they work in close contact with patients and are at the risk of being affected by COVID-19 and all respiratory infections. Several guidelines for dental practice environments have been published by dental associations and regulatory boards. It is already evident that biological, psychological and social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have present and future impacts on dental practice. Dental schools, regulatory boards, scientific associations, government authorities, and public and private health care services must join efforts to design enduring answers for severe and long-standing viral challenges.","Mattos, Flávio Freitas; Pordeus, Isabela Almeida",Brazilian oral research,https://doi.org/10.1590/1807-3107bor-2020.vol34.0085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32696908/,440

115219,Scientific and Ethical Principles Underlying Recommendations From the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for COVID-19 Vaccination Implementation.,2020-10-22,"PURPOSE Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) may predispose to venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial thromboembolism due to excessive inflammation, hypoxia, immobilization and diffuse intravascular coagulation. The understanding of the association might be helpful in early vigilant monitoring and better management of COVID-19 patients at a high risk. Thus, in this meta-analysis we aim to assess the association of venous thromboembolism with severity of COVID-19 disease. METHODS A literature search was conducted on PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using the keywords ""COVID-19 and thromboembolism"" and ""COVID-19 and embolism"", till 20 February 2021. Thirteen studies including 6648 COVID-19 patients were incorporated in this systematic review and exploratory meta- analysis. RESULTS The analysis revealed nearly three times more risk of intensive care unit (ICU) care in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared to non-VTE patients (RR: 2.78; 95% CI: 1.75- 4.39; p <0.001; I2 : 65.1 %). Patients with pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis are at increased risk of being admitted to ICU (RR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.86-2.61; p<0.001; I2 :41.2%) and (RR: 2.69; 95 % CI: 2.37-3.06; p <0.001; I2 : 0.0 %), respectively. The quality assessment indicated that the included studies were of fair quality. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that venous thromboembolism either deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism may have a negative effect on the health status of COVID-19 patients. The study highlights the need to consider measures for reducing thromboembolism risk among COVID-19 patients.","Srivastava, Rashmi; Parveen, Rizwana; Mishra, Pinki; Saha, Nilanjan; Bajpai, Ram; Agarwal, Nidhi Bharal",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14910; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34549867/,440

This preclinical study compares the behavior of a new mesh (Parietex composite ventral patch [Ptx]) with that of two existing meshes used for ventral hernia repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-four New Zealand White rabbits (3000 g) were used in an experimental model of umbilical hernia repair (diameter 1.5 cm). The materials tested were: Ventralex ST hernia patch (Vent) (Bard Davol Inc, Warwick, RI) (n = 18); Proceed ventral patch (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) (PVP) (n = 18) and Ptx (Covidien, Sofradim, Trevoux, France) (n = 18). At 3, 7, 14 d, and 6 wk after implant, peritoneal behavior and adhesion formation were assessed by sequential laparoscopy. Mesh mesothelial cover was determined by scanning electron microscopy. Host tissue ingrowth (collagens I and III) and the macrophage response were assessed by immunohistochemical labeling. Animals were euthanized at 2, 6 wk, and 6 mo after surgery. Data were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS Adhesion formation from 3 d-6 wk was significantly greater (P < 0.05) for PVP compared with Vent or Ptx. Three encapsulated PVP implants showed ""tissue-integrated"" adhesions affecting the intestinal loops. All three implant types showed similar patterns of collagen l and III deposition. The PVP mesh elicited the greater macrophage response both at 2 wk and 6 mo. CONCLUSIONS Ptx and Vent showed excellent mesothelialization, which led to minimum adhesion formation. The appropriate tissue integration of Ptx in the parietal neoperitoneum is likely attributable to its deployment system.","García-Moreno, Francisca; Pérez-López, Paloma; Sotomayor, Sandra; Pérez-Köhler, Bárbara; Bayon, Yves; Pascual, Gemma; Bellón, Juan M",The Journal of surgical research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2014.07.049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25150083/,440

OBJECTIVES to investigate sociodemographic and disease-related factors that can influence self-perceived knowledge (poor/medium vs high) about COVID-19 in women of the Italian NINFEA birth cohort. DESIGN cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS a web-based anonymous survey on COVID-19 was sent in April 2020 to women participating in the NINFEA cohort. A total of 3,129 women were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES using multiple weighted logistic regression models, self-perceived knowledge level was analysed in relation with the following variables: age, education level, family size, cumulative incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases until 7 April 2020 by province, presence of COVID-19-like symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 testing, and COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS the prevalence of self-perceived poor/medium knowledge was 57%. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, the odds ratio (OR) of self-perceived poor/medium COVID-19 knowledge level was increased for low/medium compared with high education level (OR 1.57; 95%CI 1.34-1.84), and decreased for SARS-CoV-2 testing (OR 0.25; 95%CI 0.16-0.39) and COVID-19 diagnosis (OR 0.20; 95%CI 0.07-0.60). There was no evidence of association between the other analysed variables and self-perceived knowledge level. CONCLUSIONS the findings of this study suggest that low educational level is a determinant of low self-perceived knowledge on COVID-19 in middle-aged women.","Moccia, Chiara; Popovic, Maja; Isaevska, Elena; Moirano, Giovenale; Pizzi, Costanza; Rusconi, Franca; Merletti, Franco; Maule, Milena Maria; Richiardi, Lorenzo",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,https://doi.org/10.19191/ep20.5-6.s2.138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33412830/,440

122812,"Covid-19: Intensive care mortality has fallen by a third since pandemic began, researchers find.",2020-07-17,"BackgroundIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems have received guidelines as part of coordinated response efforts aimed at mitigating exposures and ensuring occupational wellbeing, including recommendations of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) utilization, and modifications of Emergency Medical Dispatch (EMD) caller queries. The aim of the study was to estimate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of an EMD telephone screening process for the identification of hospital diagnosed COVID-19 positive patients.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted of adult EMS encounters presenting to hospitals within a large health system from March 16-June 30, 2020. EMD telephone screening status was defined as either ""positive"" or ""negative"" and was collected from prehospital medical records. COVID-19 positive patients were confirmed via hospital laboratory diagnosis and were matched to their prehospital medical record data. Patient demographics and EMS encounter level data, such as Dispatch Code and Priority level, were also collected. Estimations of sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were made. Emergency telephone screening status was stratified by COVID-19 diagnosis to describe discordant pairs.ResultsOf the 3,443 total encounters screened, there were 652 patients who were subsequently COVID-19 positive per hospital diagnosis (18.9%). Approximately 5% of all encounters did not screen positive on EMD screening but were later COVID-19 positive. Conversely, 44.2% of encounters screened positive for COVID-19, but were subsequently negative. Sensitivity of the EMD telephonic screening was estimated as 75.0% (95% CI 71.7%, 78.3%) and specificity was 45.5% (95% CI 43.7%, 47.4%). The PPV was 24.3% (95% CI 22.5%, 26.0%), and NPV 88.6% (95% 87.0%, 90.3%).ConclusionsThe sensitivity of the EMD telephonic screening process was moderately able to identify COVID-19 positive patients. There is a need to re-evaluate and revise guidelines and recommendations, specifically modified caller queries, as part of ongoing pandemic emergency response efforts in order to reduce transmissions and maximize patient and provider safety.","McCann-Pineo, Molly; Li, Timmy; Barbara, Paul; Levinsky, Brian; Debono, James; Berkowitz, Jonathan",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,https://doi.org/10.1080/10903127.2021.1939817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34115573/,440

To determine the number of excess deaths (i.e., those exceeding historical trends after accounting for COVID-19 deaths) occurring in Florida during the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods. Using seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average time-series modeling and historical mortality trends in Florida, we forecasted monthly deaths from January to September of 2020 in the absence of the pandemic. We compared estimated deaths with monthly recorded total deaths (i.e., all deaths regardless of cause) during the COVID-19 pandemic and deaths only from COVID-19 to measure excess deaths in Florida.Results. Our results suggest that Florida experienced 19 241 (15.5%) excess deaths above historical trends from March to September 2020, including 14 317 COVID-19 deaths and an additional 4924 all-cause, excluding COVID-19, deaths in that period.Conclusions. Total deaths are significantly higher than historical trends in Florida even when accounting for COVID-19-related deaths.

As therapeutics, mesenchymal stem cells or even just their secreted products may be used to regenerate tissue lost through injury or disease and suppress damaging immune reactions. However, these cells lack unique markers and are hard to identify and isolate as pure cell populations. They are often grown in laboratories using basic and undefined culture conditions. We cannot even agree on their name.

BACKGROUND Endoscopic therapies have emerged capable of eradicating BE with high efficacy and low complication rates, but which patients should receive treatment is still debated. Current knowledge of risk factors is insufficient to allow for the accurate prediction of which patients will progress to dysplasia or adenocarcinoma. METHODS We retrospectively collected data from a cohort of BE patients over a 13-year period. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to predict progression. A simplified risk of progression (ROP) score was developed from weighted beta coefficients. Internal validation was performed using bootstrap analysis, and model discrimination was assessed using k-fold cross-validation. RESULTS The cohort included 2591 BE patients of which 133 progressed to dysplasia/adenocarcinoma. Multivariable analysis with bootstrap internal validation resulted in 5 variables associated with an increased ROP (age ≥70 years, male sex, lack of proton-pump inhibitor use, segment greater than 3 cm, and history of esophageal candidiasis). Using this model, we developed a simple ROP score between 0 and 8. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed a cutoff of 3 or higher to have a sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 79%, respectively. Patients with a score of 3 or higher had an odds ratio of 9.04 (95% confidence interval 6.06-13.46). The c-statistic obtained from 10-fold cross-validation was 0.76 (95% confidence interval 0.72-0.79), indicating good overall discrimination. CONCLUSIONS Our data show the development and internal validation of the Barrett's Esophagus Assessment of Risk Score as capable of quantifying the likelihood of progression to dysplasia/adenocarcinoma. The Barrett's Esophagus Assessment of Risk Score can be used clinically to guide treatment decisions in nondysplastic BE patients.","Brown, Craig S; Lapin, Brittany; Goldstein, Jay L; Linn, John G; Talamonti, Mark S; Carbray, Joann; Ujiki, Michael B",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000002179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28230661/,440

Although all patients with HLH typically need intensive anti-inflammatory therapy, patients with FHL also need HSCT to be cured. In the international HLH-2004 study, 187 children aged <18 years fulfilling the study inclusion criteria (5 of 8 diagnostic criteria, affected sibling, or molecular diagnosis in FHL-causative genes) underwent 209 transplants (2004-2012), defined as indicated in patients with familial/genetic, relapsing, or severe/persistent disease. Five-year overall survival (OS) post-HSCT was 66% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59-72); event-free survival (EFS) was 60% (95% CI, 52-67). Five-year OS was 81% (95% CI, 65-90) for children with a complete response and 59% (95% CI, 48-69) for those with a partial response (hazard ratio [HR], 2.12; 95% CI, 1.06-4.27; P = .035). For children with verified FHL (family history/genetically verified, n = 134), 5-year OS was 71% (95% CI, 62-78) and EFS was 62% (95% CI, 54-70); 5-year OS for children without verified FHL (n = 53) was significantly lower (52%; 95% CI, 38-65) (P = .040; HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.03-2.77); they were also significantly older. Notably, 20 (38%) of 53 patients without verified FHL had natural killer cell activity reported as normal at diagnosis, after 2 months, or at HSCT, suggestive of secondary HLH; and in addition 14 (26%) of these 53 children had no evidence of biallelic mutations despite having 3 or 4 FHL genes analyzed (natural killer cell activity not analyzed after 2 months or at HSCT). We conclude that post-HSCT survival in FHL remains suboptimal, and that the FHL diagnosis should be carefully investigated before HSCT. Pretransplant complete remission is beneficial but not mandatory to achieve post-HSCT survival.

We characterized the genetics of hearing loss throughout the Palestinian population, enrolling 2,198 participants from 491 families from all parts of the West Bank and Gaza. In Palestinian families with no prior history of hearing loss, we estimate that 56% of hearing loss is genetic and 44% is not genetic. For the great majority (87%) of families with inherited hearing loss, panel-based genomic DNA sequencing, followed by segregation analysis of large kindreds and transcriptional analysis of participant RNA, enabled identification of the causal genes and mutations, including at distant noncoding sites. Genetic heterogeneity of hearing loss was striking with respect to both genes and alleles: The 337 solved families harbored 143 different mutations in 48 different genes. For one in four solved families, a transcription-altering mutation was the responsible allele. Many of these mutations were cryptic, either exonic alterations of splice enhancers or silencers or deeply intronic events.

In the absence of fully protective health interventions, producers rely on controlled exposure to induce an immune response in pigs and minimize the clinical outcomes of MHP infection in pig populations. This study compared the effect of route of exposure on MHP infection, antibody response, clinical signs, and pathology. Six-week-old MHP-negative pigs (n = 78) were allocated to negative control (n = 6) or one of three MHP exposure routes: intratracheal (n = 24, feeding catheter), intranasal (n = 24, atomization device), and aerosol (n = 24, fogger). Body weight, cough indices, and samples (serum, oral fluid, tracheal) were collected weekly through 49 days post-exposure (DPE). Intratrachal exposure produced the highest proportion (24/24) of MHP DNA-positive pigs on DPE 7, as well as earlier and higher serum antibody response. Intranasal and aerosol exposures resulted in infection with MHP DNA detected in tracheal samples from 18/24 and 21/24 pigs on DPE 7, respectively. Aerosol exposure had the least impact on weight gain (0.64 kg/day). No difference was observed among treatment groups in coughing and lung lesions at necropsy. While intratracheal inoculation and seeder animals are frequently used in swine production settings, intranasal or aerosol exposure are viable alternatives to achieve MHP infection. Regardless of the route, steps should be taken to verify the purity of the inoculum and, in the case of aerosol exposure, avert the unintended exposure of personnel and animals to other pathogens.","Poeta Silva, Ana Paula S; Marostica, Thaire P; McDaniel, Aric; Arruda, Bailey L; Alonso, Carmen; Derscheid, Rachel; Yeske, Paul; Linhares, Daniel C L; Giménez-Lirola, Luis; Karriker, Locke; Fano, Eduardo; Zimmerman, Jeffrey J; Clavijo, Maria J",Veterinary microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2021.109118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34058523/,440
153950,Viability and validity of the bispectral index to measure sleep in patients in the intensive care unit.,2020-11-27,"OBJECTIVES Continuous improvement in the delivery of health services is increasingly being demanded in the UK at a time when budgets are being cut. Simulation is one approach used for understanding and assessing the likely impact of changes to the delivery of health services. However, little is known about the usefulness of simulation for analysing the delivery of sexual health services (SHSs). We propose a simulation method to model and evaluate patient flows and resource use within an SHS to inform service redesign. METHODS We developed a discrete event simulation (DES) model to identify the bottlenecks within the Unity SHS (Bristol, UK) and find possible routes for service improvement. Using the example of the introduction of an online service for sexually transmitted infection (STI) and HIV self-sampling for asymptomatic patients, the impact on patient waiting times was examined as the main outcome measure. The model included data such as patient arrival time, staff availability and duration of consultation, examination and treatment. We performed several sensitivity analyses to assess uncertainty in the model parameters. RESULTS We identified some bottlenecks under the current system, particularly in the consultation and treatment queues for male and female walk-in patients. Introducing the provision of STI and HIV self-sampling alongside existing services decreased the average waiting time (88 vs 128 min) for all patients and reduced the cost of staff time for managing each patient (£72.64 vs £88.74) compared with the current system without online-based self-sampling. CONCLUSIONS The provision of online-based STI and HIV self-sampling for asymptomatic patients could be beneficial in reducing patient waiting times and the model highlights the complexities of using this to cut costs. Attributing recognition for any improvement requires care, but DES modelling can provide valuable insights into the design of SHSs ensuing in quantifiable improvements. Extension of this method with the collection of additional data and the construction of more informed models seems worthwhile.","Mohiuddin, Syed; Gardiner, Rebecca; Crofts, Megan; Muir, Peter; Steer, Jonathan; Turner, Jonathan; Wheeler, Helen; Hollingworth, William; Horner, Paddy J",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-037084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32641336/,440

161722,Pressure Injuries Due to Personal Protective Equipment in COVID-19 Critical Care Units.,2021-04-29,"BACKGROUND Although both pressure and flow are considered important determinants of regional organ perfusion, the relative importance of each is less established. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of variations in flow, pressure, or both on cerebral and whole-body oxygen saturation. METHODS Thirty-four consenting patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass were included. Using a randomized cross-over design, four different haemodynamic states were simulated: (i) 20% flow decrease, (ii) 20% flow decrease with phenylephrine to restore baseline pressure, (iii) 20% pressure decrease with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) under baseline flow, and (iv) increased flow with baseline pressure. The effect of these changes was evaluated on cerebral (Sc(O₂)) and systemic (Sv(O₂)) oxygen saturation, and on systemic oxygen extraction ratio (OER). Data were assessed by within- and between-group comparisons. RESULTS Decrease in flow was associated with a decrease in [from 63.5 (7.4) to 62.0 (8.5) %, P<0.001]. When arterial pressure was restored with phenylephrine during low flow, Sc(O₂) further decreased from 61.0 (9.7) to 59.2 (10.2) %, P<0.001. Increase in flow was associated with an increase in Sc(O₂) from 62.6 (7.7) to 63.6 (8.9) %, P=0.03, while decreases in pressure with the use of SNP did not affect Sc(O₂). Sv(O₂) was significantly lower (P<0.001) and OER was significantly higher (P<0.001) in the low flow arms. CONCLUSIONS In the present elective cardiac surgery population, Sc(O₂) and Sv(O₂) were significantly lower with lower flow, regardless of systemic arterial pressure. Moreover, phenylephrine administration was associated with a reduced cerebral and systemic oxygen saturation.","Moerman, A; Denys, W; De Somer, F; Wouters, P F; De Hert, S G",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aet197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23740043/,440
163894,The use of virtual reality in a psychiatric intensive care unit: a pilot study,2021,"BackgroundCOVID-19 restrictions led to widespread disruption of SRH services in Britain following the first national lockdown (23/3/2020). One-in-ten people who tried to access SRH services during reported being unable to do so (Natsal-COVID). We used mixed-methods research to quantify unmet need and explore its context and impact.Methods6,657 participants aged 18–59 years completed a web-panel survey (29/07–10/08/20). Quota-based sampling and weighting enabled a quasi-representative population sample to be achieved. Quantitative analysis focused on participants’ challenges accessing contraception and STI-related services since lockdown. We conducted 23 in-depth interviews with participants, 15 who reported not receiving an SRH service and eight who discussed this in a different topic interview.ResultsReasons for not receiving STI-related (n=103) or contraception services (n=144) despite need included that appointments were unavailable (STI-related services: 28.6% (95%CI:19.5–39.8)/Contraception services 36.3% (28.1% – 45.4%)), were cancelled (22.8% (14.9%- 33.3%)/23.9% (16.8%-32.8%) or services were closed (21.2% (13.7%-31.4)/26.1% (19.1%-34.5%). Discomfort with using online/telephone services was more common amongst those not receiving STI-related services 26.0% (17.4%-36.9%) than for contraception services 6.7% (3.4%-12.8%).Interviewees described how some services were unavailable, while others were disrupted. Many were offered and received alternatives to in-person service (e.g. telephone/online) and some had to use different contraceptive methods. Most understood attempts to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission and found alternatives convenient, though others saw them as inferior due to interaction limitations. Tenacity was required to access some services. Several participants described how they had avoided or deprioritised their own needs. Fears of contracting COVID-19 and of judgement for having sex against restrictions deterred help-seeking.ConclusionWhile some people were unable to access an anticipated service, many were offered alternatives with varied consequences. Services may need to adapt further to improve access by offering efficient face-to-face and remote provision while emphasising lack of judgement and validating help seeking.","Reid, D.; Dema, E.; Perez, R.

Herein, we report a respiration monitoring triboelectric nanogenerator (RM-TENG) with nanofibrous membranes, which can be used as a smart, changeable, self-powered mask filter with high filtration efficiency for monitoring multiple respiratory indices (e.g., RR, tin, tex, IER). We created a mathematical model to quantitatively analyze the effects of gap distance between two triboelectric layers on the contact area by recording the nanofibers layer's deformation profile with digital image correlation (DIC) tests. The RM-TENG is more sensitive to smaller gap distances between 1mm - 5mm because the high specific area of nanofibers can provide a more effective contact area. An RM-TENG built with optimized structure parameters can accurately and consistently detect the above-mentioned respiratory indices with excellent sensing stability for 40hours. The monitored RR and IER have 100% and 93.53% agreement with the real-time RR and IER set on the ventilator, respectively. Furthermore, it has a filtration efficiency of 99wt% for particle sizes between 0.3µm and 5µm. This study introduces a mask filter fabricated with a simple structure with both filtering and sensing capability, which has excellent potential for self-powered health diagnostics.","He, Haijun Guo Jian Illés Balázs Géczy Attila Istók Balázs Hliva Viktor Török Dániel Kovács József Gábor Harmati István Molnár Kolos",Nano Energy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106418,440

Special tools and laboratory practice were applied to avoid false-positive results, while false-negatives are avoided by internal controls (mimics). At present, the classical nested PCR methods are being replaced by real-time TaqMan and molecular beacon assays and the multiplex real-time PCR detection of viruses is also under development. By direct sequencing of the PCR products, phylogeny studies are performed and molecular epizootiology results are provided for rapid and exact identification of virus variants. Molecular epizootiology also contributes to trace the routes of virus spreading on large geographic areas.

192760,Stress among Anesthesiology Nurses/Technicians Working in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU): Experiences and Comparisons.,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is currently spreading in many countries. This paper proposes a simple approximate mathematical model for public health practitioners to predict the number of SARS cases and deaths. METHODS The model is based on four parameters: R(o) (basic reproductive number), F (case-fatality rate), i (incubation period), and d (duration of disease). The calculations can be done by hand or by using a computer spreadsheet. RESULTS The best parameters to fit Canadian data as of 6 April 2003 (before infection controls took effect) are R(o) = 1.5, F = 30%, i = 5 days, d = 14 days. On 6 April (day 40) there were 74 cases and 7 deaths. If this trend continues, SARS numbers in Canada are predicted to be as follows: 387 cases and 34 deaths by 26 April (day 60), 4432 cases and 394 deaths by 26 May (day 90), and 50 500 cases and 4489 deaths by 25 June (day 120). By comparison, the best parameters to fit Hong Kong data as of 10 April 2003 are R(o) = 2.0, F = 20%, i = 5 days, d = 14 days. CONCLUSIONS Using the proposed mathematical model, it was estimated that about 1.5 to 2 new infectious cases were produced per infectious case every five days. Also, about 20% to 30% of the cases die within 14 days. The case-fatality may therefore be considerably higher than initially thought. The model indicates that SARS can spread very fast when there are no interventions.","Choi, B C K; Pak, A W P",Journal of epidemiology and community health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14573591/,440

Major topics of this review include the incidence and causes of this phenomenon, in addition to an examination of current strategies for prevention of intraoperative awareness. Awareness with recall creates substantial physical and/or psychological distress for the patient, representing a continued threat to patient safety. Factors related to cases of awareness include those of the patient, surgical procedure, anesthesia provider, and system in which providers deliver care. Anesthesia providers today consider use of electroencephalographic depth-of-anesthesia monitors such as the bispectral index monitor (BIS, Covidien, now Medtronic), as a potential tool for preventing awareness. This Journal course explores evidence related to the utility and limitations of this monitor in clinical practice.

This study sought to observe the effect of a postoperative standardised haemodynamic protocol (SHP) on the administration of fluid and vasoactive drugs after high-risk cardiac surgery. This was an interventional pilot study. In 2010 to 2011, the SHP was introduced to the ICU at Wellington Regional Hospital, Wellington, New Zealand, for the perioperative management of patients undergoing high-risk cardiac surgery. A pulmonary artery catheter was inserted in the patients in the study group and fluids and supportive medications were provided in the ICU according to a protocol that targeted a cardiac index ≥ 2 l/min/m², mixed venous oxygen saturation ≥ 60% and a mean arterial pressure of 65 to 75 mmHg. Data from 40 consecutive high-risk cardiac surgical patients assigned to this protocol were compared with a matched cohort of 40 consecutive high-risk cardiac surgical patients receiving 'usual care' in 2009. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. There was no significant difference in the duration of noradrenaline infusion in the SHP cohort compared to historical controls (median [IQR] 18.5 hours [31.63] versus 18 hours [18.3]; P=0.35), despite patients receiving more fluid in their first 12 hours in the ICU (mean 4687 ml [SD ± 2284 ml] versus 1889 ml [SD ± 1344 ml]; P <0.001). The SHP cohort had a higher rate of reintubation (4 in 37 [10.8%] versus 0 in 40 [0%]; P=0.049).

In particular, their risk of developing feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) was determined. The seropositive cats were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: cats from households in which FIP had recently been diagnosed; cats from households in which FIP had not been diagnosed, but from which kittens had been relocated and subsequently died of FIP; and cats from households in which FIP had not been diagnosed. Cats in the first group were not at greater risk of developing FIP than were cats in the other 2 groups. Consequently, any household in which seropositive cats live must be considered a potential source of FCoV that can cause FIP. There was no evidence that the enhanced disease, which has been described after experimentally induced infection of seropositive cats, exists in nature. Thus, analysis of the survival of the seropositive cats over periods of up to 36 months indicated that their risk of developing FIP decreased with time, suggesting the development of immunity rather than increased susceptibility to disease. In addition, of 56 cats deemed to have been naturally reinfected because their anti-FCoV antibody titers decreased and subsequently increased, only 3 developed FIP.","Addie, D D; Toth, S; Murray, G D; Jarrett, O",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7785816/,440

The relationship between the 38/39K and 24K proteins was demonstrated by two-dimensional peptide mapping, which revealed four identical peptides. Additionally, it was found that neither the 38/39K nor the 24K protein is glycosylated, but that the 24K protein is phosphorylated at serine residues. Experiments employing various cell separation protocols revealed that the 38/39K and the 24K proteins are evenly distributed within infected cells; this was confirmed by immunofluorescence techniques using 38/39K- or 24K-specific MAbs.

A total of 11 studies included accounting for 2084 COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19 patients with a mean age>50 years was 13.2%, whereas studies with relatively younger patients (mean age <50 years) had a pooled prevalence of 9.0% CONCLUSION: The overall prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19 patients was found to be 13.2% with studies including relatively elderly patients showing higher rates of diabetes. The intermingled effects of diabetes with other cardiovascular comorbidities warrant age-specific outcomes data including the impact of ongoing antidiabetic treatment.","Desai, Rupak; Singh, Sandeep; Parekh, Tarang; Sachdeva, Sonali; Sachdeva, Rajesh; Kumar, Gautam",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,440
207968,Intensive care unit isolation hood decreases risk of aerosolization during noninvasive ventilation with COVID-19,2020,"Vaccines may induce positive non-specific immune responses to other pathogens. This study aims to evaluate if influenza vaccination in the 2019-2020 season had any effect on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection in a cohort of health workers. During the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave in Spain, between March and May 2020, a cohort of 11,201 health workers was highly tested by RT-qPCR and/or rapid antibody test when the infection was suspected. Later in June, 8665 of them were tested for total antibodies in serum. A total of 890 (7.9%) health workers were laboratory-confirmed for SARS-CoV-2 infection by any type of test, while no case of influenza was detected. The adjusted odds ratio between 2019-2020 influenza vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection was the same (1.07; 95% CI, 0.92-1.24) in both comparisons of positive testers with all others (cohort design) and with negative testers (test-negative design). Among symptomatic patients tested by RT-qPCR, the comparison of positive cases and negative controls showed an adjusted odds ratio of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.68-1.08). These results suggest that influenza vaccination does not significantly modify the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The development of specific vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is urgent.","Martínez-Baz, Iván; Trobajo-Sanmartín, Camino; Arregui, Irati; Navascués, Ana; Adelantado, Marta; Indurain, Juan; Fresán, Ujué; Ezpeleta, Carmen; Castilla, Jesús",,,440

212152,Experience of augmenting critical care capacity in Daegu during COVID-19 incident in South Korea,2020,"There are dilemmas in the minds of consumers with respect to sugar consumption - they would like to consume sugars for sweetness, but in a healthy (and perhaps guilt free!) way. In a sense, consumers believe that if sugar does not appear as an ingredient on the product label, but is intrinsic in the food (and will appear as a nutrient), it is 'good'. As an ingredient, however, it is viewed as a 'bad chemical' associated with tooth decay and obesity. The reality is that unless processing induced modifications have occurred, the sugar molecule within a plant tissue is the same molecule structure as present in purified sugar. The same calorific value. However, there is an argument that humans eat too refined food and that if sugars were eaten in their natural context (e.g. within a fruit), their presence and concentration would be in harmony (where different nutrients complement and balance the sugar concentration) with the human body. This reflects the process of eating, satiety, presence of other nutrients (including water) and the associated impact of the indigestible components of plant foods on the transit/nutrient bioavailability control and thus benefits through the gut. The authors explore these issues in this article and seek to provide a scientific basis to different sides of the argument - sugar is good or bad depending on how (in which format and how much/how concentrated) it is consumed. More importantly perhaps, how should sugar consumption - an important nutrient - be managed to optimize the benefits but reduce the disadvantages? © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.","Qi, Xin; Tester, Richard",J. sci. food agric,,440

Exploiting a continuous movement of the precursor isolation window to assign precursor masses to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragment traces, Scanning SWATH increases precursor identifications by ~70% compared to conventional data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods on 0.5-5-min chromatographic gradients. We demonstrate the application of ultra-fast proteomics in drug mode-of-action screening and plasma proteomics. Scanning SWATH proteomes capture the mode of action of fungistatic azoles and statins. Moreover, we confirm 43 and identify 11 new plasma proteome biomarkers of COVID-19 severity, advancing patient classification and biomarker discovery.

Recommendations from scientific societies seek to provide safety for newborns without compromising the benefits of early contact. The aim of the study is to describe characteristics and evolution of newborns born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the implemented measures following recommendations from the Sociedad Española de Neonatología. Methods: Observational, prospective and single-center cohort study. A specific circuit was designed for mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their newborns. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected. PCR were performed in newborns at delivery and at 14 days of age. Results: 73 mothers and 75 newborns were included in the study. 95.9% of maternal infections were diagnosed during the third trimester of pregnancy, 43.8% were asymptomatic. Median gestational age was 38 weeks (IQR: 37-40), 25.9% of newborns required admission to Neonatology. Skin-to-skin mother care was performed in 68% of newborns, 80% received exclusive maternal or donated breast milk during hospital stay. No positive PCR results were observed in newborns at delivery, one case of positive PCR was observed in an asymptomatic neonate at 14 days of age. Conclusions: Risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is low when complying to the recommendations issued by Sociedad Española de Neonatología, allowing rooming-in and promoting breastfeeding.","Solís-García, Gonzalo; Gutiérrez-Vélez, Ana; Pescador Chamorro, Isabel; Zamora-Flores, Elena; Vigil-Vázquez, Sara; Rodríguez-Corrales, Elena; Sánchez-Luna, Manuel",,,440

ACSs, especially those created to specifically care for infectious patients, require a robust infection prevention and control (IPC) program. METHODS: The IPC program was led by a physician and nurse partnership, both of whom had substantial experience developing IPC programs in US and low-resource settings. The IPC program was framed on a previously described conceptual model commonly referred to as the ""4S's"": Space, Staff, Stuff, and Systems. RESULTS: The gymnasium was transformed into red, yellow, and green infection hazard zones. The IPC team trained 425 staff in critical IPC practices and personal protective equipment standards. Systems to detect staff illness were created and over 3,550 staff health screening surveys completed. DISCUSSION: Use of existing guidance and comprehensive facility and patient management assessments guided the development of the IPC program. Program priorities were to keep staff and patients safe and implement procedures to judiciously use limited resources that affect infection transmission. CONCLUSION: Planning, executing, and evaluating IPC standards and requirements of an ACS during a pandemic requires creative and nimble strategies to adapt, substitute, conserve, reuse, and reallocate IPC space, staff, stuff, and systems.","Tadavarthy, Silpa N; Finnegan, KerriAnn; Bernatowicz, Gretchen; Lowe, Elisha; Coffin, Susan E; Manning, MaryLou",Am. j. infect. control,,440

METHODS: Three hundred and fourteen patients presented with clinically suspected COVID-19, from March 3 to 23, 2020, were evaluated with PaO2/FIO2 ratio from arterial blood gas, RT-PCR assay from nasopharyngeal swab sample and chest CT. Patients were classified as COVID-19 negative and COVID-19 positive according to RT-PCR results, considered as a reference. Images were independently evaluated by two radiologists blinded to the RT-PCR results and classified as ""CT positive"" or ""CT negative"" for COVID-19, according to CT findings. RESULTS: According to RT-PCR results, 152 patients were COVID-19 negative (48%) and 162 were COVID-19 positive (52%). We found substantial agreement between RT-PCR results and CT findings (p < 0.000001), as well as an almost perfect agreement between the two readers. Mixed GGO and consolidation pattern with peripheral and bilateral distribution, multifocal or diffuse abnormalities localized in both upper lung and lower lung, in association with interlobular septal thickening, bronchial wall thickening and air bronchogram, showed higher frequency in COVID-positive patients. We also found a significant correlation between CT findings and patient's oxygenation status expressed by PaO2/FIO2 ratio. CONCLUSION: Chest CT has a useful role in the early detection and in patient management of COVID-19 pneumonia in a pandemic. It helps in identifying suspected patients, cutting off the route of transmission and avoiding further spread of infection.","Gaia, Cartocci; Maria Chiara, Colaiacomo; Silvia, Lanciotti; Chiara, Andreoli; Maria Luisa, De Cicco; Giulia, Brachetti; Silvia, Pugliese; Lucia, Capoccia; Alessandra, Tortora; Annarita, Scala; Cristina, Valentini; Maria, Almberger; Maria Rosaria, D039; Aprile,; Giacinta, Avventurieri; Riccardo, Giura; Zaher, Kharrub; Andrea, Leonardi; Maddalena, Boccia; Catalano, Carlo; Paolo, Ricci",Radiol Med,,440

METHODS: This geo-epidemiological analysis was based on data publicly available on government and administration websites for the 96 administrative departments of metropolitan France between March 19 and May 11, 2020, including Public Health France, the Regional Health Agencies, the French national statistics institute, and the Ministry of Health. Using hierarchical ascendant classification on principal component analysis of multidimensional variables, and multivariate analyses with generalised additive models, we assessed the associations between several factors (spatiotemporal spread of the epidemic between Feb 7 and March 17, 2020, the national lockdown, demographic population structure, baseline intensive care capacities, baseline population health and health-care services, new chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine dispensations, economic indicators, degree of urbanisation, and climate profile) and in-hospital COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and case fatality rates. Incidence rate was defined as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 cases per 100â000 inhabitants, mortality rate as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 deaths per 100â000, and case fatality rate as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 deaths per cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 cases. FINDINGS: From March 19 to May 11, 2020, hospitals in metropolitan France notified a total of 100â988 COVID-19 cases, including 16â597 people who were admitted to intensive care and 17â062 deaths. There was an overall cumulative in-hospital incidence rate of 155·6 cases per 100â000 inhabitants (range 19·4-489·5), in-hospital mortality rate of 26·3 deaths per 100â000 (1·1-119·2), and in-hospital case fatality rate of 16·9% (4·8-26·2). We found clear spatial heterogeneity of in-hospital COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates, following the spread of the epidemic. After multivariate adjustment, the delay between the first COVID-19-associated death and the onset of the national lockdown was positively associated with in-hospital incidence (adjusted standardised incidence ratio 1·02, 95% CI 1·01-1·04), mortality (adjusted standardised mortality ratio 1·04, 1·02-1·06), and case fatality rates (adjusted standardised fatality ratio 1·01, 1·01-1·02). Mortality and case fatality rates were higher in departments with older populations (adjusted standardised ratio for populations with a high proportion older than aged >85 years 2·17 [95% CI 1·20-3·90] for mortality and 1·43 [1·08-1·88] for case fatality rate). Mortality rate was also associated with incidence rate (1·0004, 1·0002-1·001), but mortality and case fatality rates did not appear to be associated with baseline intensive care capacities. We found no association between climate and in-hospital COVID-19 incidence, or between economic indicators and in-hospital COVID-19 incidence or mortality rates. INTERPRETATION: This ecological study highlights the impact of the epidemic spread, national lockdown, and reactive adaptation of intensive care capacities on the spatial distribution of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. It provides information for future geo-epidemiological analyses and has implications for preparedness and response policies to current and future epidemic waves in France and elsewhere.

237903,An internally validated diagnostic tool for acute invasive fungal sinusitis,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To determine if there is an association between acuity level of care (ALC), case fatality and length of stay in patients admitted to hospital due to COVID-19. DESIGN: A hospital-based observational follow-up study. SETTING: Internal Medicine Service of the Aga Khan University Hospital, Pakistan, from 26 February 2020 to 30 June 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with confirmed COVID-19, aged &#8805;18 years. METHODS: ALC was categorised into low, intermediate and high level and patients were triaged using the standard emergency severity illness score. All patients were followed until the end of hospital admission for the outcome of case fatality and length of stay. RESULTS: A total of 822 patients with COVID-19 were admitted during the study period and 699 met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 54.5 years and 67% were males; 50.4% were triaged to low, 42.5% to intermediate and 7.2% to high acuity care. The overall case-fatality rate was 11.6%, with the highest (52%) in high acuity level followed by 16.2% in intermediate and 2% in low acuity care. Acuity level was associated with case fatality, with an HR (95% CI) of 5.0 (2.0 to 12.1) for high versus low acuity care and an HR of 2.7 (1.2, 6.4) for intermediate versus low acuity care, after adjusting for age, sex and common comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and chronic lung disease. Similarly, acuity level was also associated with length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: High and intermediate acuity level is associated with higher case fatality rate and prolonged length of hospital stay in patients admitted with COVID-19. In resource-limited settings where the provision of high acuity care is limited, the intermediate care acuity could serve as a useful strategy to treat relatively less critical patients with COVID-19.","Almas, Aysha; Mushtaq, Zain; Moller, Jette",BMJ Open,,440

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of vancomycin resistant Enterococci and its associated factors among HIV infected patients on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART). METHODS: Institution based cross sectional study was conducted among HIV infected patients on ART at from June 1 to August 30, 2020. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected by pre-tested structured questionnaire. Stool sample was collected and processed by standard microbiological techniques. Kirby Bauer Disc diffusion method was used to perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Data were entered by Epi data version 4.6.0.2 and analyzed by SPSS version 25. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression model was used to analyze the association between dependent and independent variables. P-values in the multivariable analysis, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to determine the strength of association. P-value &#8804;0.05 was considered as significant. RESULTS: Enterococci spp was isolated on 123/200 (61.50%) patients. Among these isolates, the incidence of vancomycin resistant Enterococci was 11.4% [95% CI: (6.0-17.0)]. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns against Enterococci showed highest rate of resistance to ampicillin (69.9%). Multidrug resistances were observed in 49.59% of Enterococci isolates. Study participants who had prior antibioticexposurer more than two weeks [AOR = 7.35; 95% CI: (1.2144.64)] and hospitalization for the last six months [AOR = 5.68; 95% CI: (1.09 29.74)] were significantly associated with vancomycin resistant Enterococci. CONCLUSIONS: In our study high incidence of vancomycin resistant Enterococci was found. Previous exposure to antibiotics for more than two weeks and hospitalization for more than six months were significantly associated with vancomycin resistant Enterococci. The isolated Enterococci had variable degrees of resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics. Therefore, periodic surveillance on antimicrobial resistance pattern, adhering to rational use of antibiotics and implementing infection prevention protocols may reduce colonization by VRE.","Regasa Dadi, Belayneh; Solomon, Zerihun; Tesfaye, Mheret",PLoS One,,440
240599,Stages or phenotypes? A critical look at COVID-19 pathophysiology,2020,"Early marriage and its sad consequences to the girl child and socio-economic development of the nation has been an age-long issue being advocated against in many parts of Nigeria. At the onset of COVID-19, the teeming efforts to curb this issue almost got jeopardized with harsh economic situations in many households due to the lockdown and the willingness to marry off their girls to reduce this burden. Closure of schools and cases of sexual gender based violence also impacted the prevalence of early marriage during the pandemic in Nigeria. We also argue in this commentary that the pandemic has so much impacted on programs aimed at ending early marriage in the nation. Therefore, if serious and concerted efforts are not taken by relevant stakeholders, more girls will be at risk of early marriage and teenage pregnancy with their related health consequences. They will also be left behind in fulfilling their potentials and their aspirations cut off with early marriage, thus sustainable development cannot be achieved.","Musa, Shuaibu Saidu Odey Goodness Ogeyi Musa Muhammad Kabir Alhaj Samar Mohammed Sunday Blessing Abai Muhammad Suleiman Maimuna Lucero- Prisno Don Eliseo",Public Health in Practice,,440

243867,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): The Singapore Experience. A Review of the First Eight Months,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection carries a substantial risk of severe and prolonged illness; treatment options are currently limited. We assessed the efficacy and safety of inhaled nebulised interferon beta-1a (SNG001) for the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 pilot trial at nine UK sites. Adults aged 18 years or older and admitted to hospital with COVID-19 symptoms, with a positive RT-PCR or point-of-care test, or both, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive SNG001 (6 MIU) or placebo by inhalation via a mouthpiece daily for 14 days. The primary outcome was the change in clinical condition on the WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI) during the dosing period in the intention-to-treat population (all randomised patients who received at least one dose of the study drug). The OSCI is a 9-point scale, where 0 corresponds to no infection and 8 corresponds to death. Multiple analyses were done to identify the most suitable statistical method for future clinical trials. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events for 28 days. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrialsregister.eu (2020-001023-14) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04385095); the pilot trial of inpatients with COVID-19 is now completed. FINDINGS: Between March 30 and May 30, 2020, 101 patients were randomly assigned to SNG001 (n=50) or placebo (n=51). 48 received SNG001 and 50 received placebo and were included in the intention-to-treat population. 66 (67%) patients required oxygen supplementation at baseline: 29 in the placebo group and 37 in the SNG001 group. Patients receiving SNG001 had greater odds of improvement on the OSCI scale (odds ratio 2·32 [95% CI 1·07-5·04]; p=0·033) on day 15 or 16 and were more likely than those receiving placebo to recover to an OSCI score of 1 (no limitation of activities) during treatment (hazard ratio 2·19 [95% CI 1·03-4·69]; p=0·043). SNG001 was well tolerated. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse event was headache (seven [15%] patients in the SNG001 group and five [10%] in the placebo group). There were three deaths in the placebo group and none in the SNG001 group. INTERPRETATION: Patients who received SNG001 had greater odds of improvement and recovered more rapidly from SARS-CoV-2 infection than patients who received placebo, providing a strong rationale for further trials.

Of these, 16.2% had diabetes. Only one patient had asthma and one had COPD. Two patients had to stop their treatment after 3 and 9 days of dual therapy respectively due to QTc prolongation. The objective of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of the hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin combination in elderly subjects with COVID-19. During the study period, 7 of the 68 patients studied died. All deaths occurred due to severe respiratory complications of the disease. The remaining patients were considered cured after clinical signs disappeared 21 days after the PCR+ test.","Pirnay, G.; Dantier, B.; Tourid, W.; Terkemani, A.; Bachot, F.; Hadim, L.; Abdous, N.; Amara, W.; Abrous, Z.; Bozel, A.; Gaubert-Dahan, M.-L.; Aikpa, R.; Fauvelle, F.",Pharmacien Hospitalier Clinicien,,440

Whole mixtures collected from locations upgradient and downgradient of multiple fuel release sites were tested using (1) in vitro screening assays for human genotoxicity (the gamma-h2ax assay) and estrogenic effects (estrogen receptor transcriptional activation assay) and (2) chronic aquatic toxicity tests in 3 species (Ceriodaphnia dubia, Raphidocelis subcapitata, and Pimephales promelas). In vitro screening assay results demonstrated that the mixtures did not cause genotoxic or estrogenic effects. No OCOC-related aquatic toxicity was observed and, when aquatic toxicity did occur, upgradient samples typically had the same response as samples downgradient of the release, indicating that background water quality was impacting the results. This information provides additional support for previous work that focused on the individual compounds and, taken together, indicates that OCOCs from petroleum degradation at fuel release sites are unlikely to cause toxicity to human or freshwater receptors at the concentrations present.

It offers insights on how to develop a multifaceted vaccination strategy, which takes into consideration vaccination hesitancy among healthcare professionals and community-specific factors. Drawing from social psychological theories, we suggest that the root of vaccination hesitancy lies in conflicting representations or cognitive polyphasia.

Yet the philosophical justification for maximizing life-years is underdeveloped and has a complex history that is not reflected in recent literature. In this article, we offer a critical investigation of the use of life-years, arguing that evidence of public support for the life-years approach is thin and that organ transplantation protocols (heavily cited in pandemic-response protocols) do not provide a precedent for seeking to save the most life-years. We point out that many state emergency-response plans ultimately rejected or severely attenuated the meaning of saving the most life-years, and we argue that philosophical arguments in support of rationing by life-years are remarkably wanting. We conclude by offering a fair alternative that adheres to the standard duties of beneficence, respect for persons, and justice.","Gaurke, MaryKatherine Prusak Bernard Jeong Kyeong Yun Scire Emily Sulmasy Daniel P.",Hastings Center Report,,440

Internet use by children, and by adults on behalf exposes children to conduct, contact and content risks online. These risks mean that cyber-safety in the early years is increasingly necessary, especially concerning increased internet usage during COVID-19. While cyber-safety is well developed for primary and secondary-school aged children this is not the case for young children, their families and educators. This paper proposes a research agenda for cyber-safety in the early years, using critical constructivism and internet studies to define the internet as a non-unitary technology.

While nephrologists may think that how patients do this is up to them and their insurance companies, there is growing evidence that providing advice on how to commute to dialysis is part of an integrated care plan for dialysis patients. In this issue of Clinical Kidney Journal, two reports emphasize the importance of transport modality on dialysis patient well-being and even survival. Rincon et al. report on the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Spanish haemodialysis unit. A key source of infection was related to access to healthcare or elderly care facilities. Indeed, healthcare transportation with future symptomatic [odds ratio (OR) = 3.33] or asymptomatic (OR = 4.73) COVID-19 patients increased the risk of infection. Working with transport providers to minimize cross-infection between patients during transport was one of the measures taken to stop disease transmission. Lessons learned from COVID-19 may also apply to influenza and other infections. In the second report, Yazawa et al. describe an association between transport modality to the dialysis facility and health-related quality of life (QOL) among haemodialysis patients in the Japanese Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns study. These reports emphasize the need for nephrologists to understand how patients are transported to dialysis and how transport modality may be optimized to promote QOL and decrease potentially life-threatening complications.","Fernandez-Prado, Raul; Gonzalez-Parra, Emilio; Ortiz, Alberto",Clin Kidney J,,440

Here, we report about our local experience in a region with high COVID-19 prevalence and dynamically increasing infection rates. Methods: Within the 8-d period of March 16-24, 2020, hybrid imaging studies of asymptomatic patients who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT or 131I SPECT/CT for standard oncologic indications at our institution in Brescia, Italy, were analyzed for findings suggestive of COVID-19. The presence, radiologic features, and metabolic activity of interstitial pneumonia were identified, correlated with the subsequent short-term clinical course, and described in a case series. Results: Six of 65 patients (9%) who underwent PET/CT for various malignancies showed unexpected signs of interstitial pneumonia on CT and elevated regional 18F-FDG avidity. Additionally, 1 of 12 patients who received radioiodine for differentiated thyroid carcinoma also showed interstitial pneumonia on SPECT/CT. Five of 7 patients had subsequent proof of COVID-19 by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The remaining 2 patients were not tested immediately but underwent quarantine and careful monitoring. Conclusion: Incidental findings suggestive of COVID-19 may not be infrequent in hybrid imaging of asymptomatic patients in regions with an expansive spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Rapid, Living Practice Points From the American College of Physicians (Version 1)",2021,"BACKGROUND: Ventricular assist device (VAD) patients are at high risk for morbidities and mortality. One potentially beneficial component of the Joint Commission VAD Certification process is the requirement that individual VAD programs select 4 performance measures to improve and optimize patients' clinical outcomes. PROBLEM STATEMENT: Review of patient data after our program's first certification visit in 2008 showed that, compared to national recommendations and published reports, our patients had suboptimal outcomes in 4 areas after device implantation: length of hospital stay, receipt of early (<48 hours) postsurgical physical therapy, driveline infection incidence, and adequacy of nutritional status (prealbumin &#8805;18 mg/dL). METHODS: Plan-Do-Study-Act processes were implemented to shorten length of stay, increase patient receipt of early physical therapy, decrease driveline infection incidence, and improve nutritional status. With 2008 as our baseline, we deployed interventions for each outcome area across 2009 to 2017. Performance improvement activities included staff, patient, and family didactic, one-on-one, and hands-on education; procedural changes; and outcomes monitoring with feedback to staff on progress. Descriptive and inferential statistics were examined to document change in the outcomes. OUTCOMES: Across the performance improvement period, length of stay decreased from 40 to 23 days; physical therapy consults increased from 87% to 100% of patients; 1-year driveline infection incidence went from 38% to 23.5%; and the percentage of patients with prealbumin within the normal range increased from 84% to 90%. IMPLICATIONS: Performance improvement interventions may enhance ventricular assist device patient outcomes.

Rapid, Living Practice Points From the American College of Physicians (Version 1)",2021,"Background: A patient&rsquo;s infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence Methods: The clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients&rsquo;oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed Results: In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study In total, 28 (42 4%) women and 38 men (57 6%) with a median age of 44 0 (34 0&ndash;62 0) years were analyzed After in-hospital treatment, patients&rsquo;inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9 5 (6 0&ndash;11 0) days By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16 7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients&rsquo;stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11 0 (9 0&ndash;16 0) days after symptom onset Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2 0 (1 0&ndash;4 0) days Results for only four (6 9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases;viral RNA was still present in three patients&rsquo;urine specimens after throat swabs were negative Using a multiple linear regression model ( F =2 669, P =0 044, and adjusted R 2 =0 122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients&rsquo;stools ( t =-2 699, P =0 010) The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs 8 0 days, respectively;t =2 550, P =0 013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs 11 days, respectively;t =4 631, P &lt;0 001) There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results ( P &gt;0 05) Conclusions: In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients&rsquo;stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity","LING, Yun; XU, Shui Bao; LIN, Yi Xiao; TIAN, Di; ZHU, Zhao Qin; DAI, Fa Hui; WU, Fan; SONG, Zhi gang; HUANG, Wei; CHEN, Jun; HU, Bi Jie; WANG, Sheng; MAO, En Qiang; ZHU, Lei; ZHANG, Wen Hong; LU, Hong Zhou",Chinese Medical Journal,,440
268392,UV box: An innovative in-house use of UV irradiation for conservation of respirators in COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Decisions under threat are crucial to survival and require integration of distinct situational features such as threat probability and magnitude. Recent evidence from human lesion and neuroimaging studies implicated anterior hippocampus (aHC) and amygdala in approach/avoidance decisions under threat, and linked their integrity to cautious behavior. Here we sought to elucidate how threat dimensions and behavior are represented in these structures.Twenty human participants (11 female) completed an approach-avoidance conflict task during high-resolution functional MRI. Participants could gather tokens under threat of capture by a virtual predator, which would lead to token loss. Threat probability (predator wake-up rate) and magnitude (amount of token loss) varied on each trial. To disentangle effects of threat features, and ensuing behavior, we performed a multifold parametric analysis.We found that high threat probability and magnitude related to BOLD signal in left anterior hippocampus/entorhinal cortex. However BOLD signal in this region was better explained by avoidance behavior than by these threat features. A priori region-of-interest analysis confirmed the relation of anterior hippocampus BOLD response with avoidance. Exploratory subfield analysis revealed that this relation was specific to anterior CA2/3 but not CA1. Left lateral amygdala responded to low and high, but not intermediate threat probability.Our results suggest that anterior hippocampus BOLD signal is better explained by avoidance behavior than by threat features in approach-avoidance conflict. Rather than representing threat features in a monotonic manner, it appears that anterior hippocampus may compute approach/avoidance decisions based on integration of situational threat features represented in other neural structures.Significance statementAn effective threat anticipation system is crucial to survival across species. Natural threats, however, are diverse and have distinct features. To be able to adapt to different modes of danger, the brain needs to recognize these features, integrate them and use them to modify behavior. Our results disclose the human anterior hippocampus as a likely arbiter of approach/avoidance decisions harnessing compound environmental information while partially replicating previous findings and blending into recent efforts to illuminate the neural basis of approach-avoidance conflict in humans.","Abivardi, Aslan; Khemka, Saurabh; Bach, Dominik R",J. neurosci,,440
270871,Adapting a picu to the first COVID-19 pandemic wave,2021,"The advent of biopharmaceuticals in modern medicine brought enormous benefits to the treatment of numerous human diseases and improved the well-being of many people worldwide. First introduced in the market in the early 1980s, the number of approved biopharmaceutical products has been steadily increasing, with therapeutic proteins, antibodies, and their derivatives accounting for most of the generated revenues. The success of pharmaceutical biotechnology is closely linked with remarkable developments in DNA recombinant technology, which has enabled the production of proteins with high specificity. Among promising biopharmaceuticals are interferons, first described by Isaacs and Lindenmann in 1957 and approved for clinical use in humans nearly thirty years later. Interferons are secreted autocrine and paracrine proteins, which by regulating several biochemical pathways have a spectrum of clinical effectiveness against viral infections, malignant diseases, and multiple sclerosis. Given their relevance and sustained market share, this review provides an overview on the evolution of interferon manufacture, comprising their production, purification, and formulation stages. Remarkable developments achieved in the last decades are herein discussed in three main sections: (i) an upstream stage, including genetically engineered genes, vectors, and hosts, and optimization of culture conditions (culture media, induction temperature, type and concentration of inducer, induction regimens, and scale);(ii) a downstream stage, focusing on single- and multiple-step chromatography, and emerging alternatives (e.g., aqueous two-phase systems);and (iii) formulation and delivery, providing an overview of improved bioactivities and extended half-lives and targeted delivery to the site of action.

272599,Challenges faced in establishing a dedicated 250 bed COVID-19 intensive care unit in a temporary structure,2020,"BACKGROUND The present Covid-19 situation has created an era of learning through the electronic devices, where YouTube channel is playing an important role. Neuroanatomy is a complex subject requiring three-dimensional orientation of the structures. Practical teaching by using the cadaveric specimens is a usual practice, but in the current situation the virtual platform is an indispensable and sustainable option for both teaching and learning activities. In the present study the utility of YouTube and digital content on neuroanatomy was assessed among I MBBS students using selfadministered questionnaire during Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS The questionnaire based cross sectional study of prosected neuroanatomy specimens in the department of Anatomy were utilized to create digital content modules. According to the topics, PDF content was generated, and it was shared before the commencement of virtual class. Later YouTube link was shared with our I MBBS students through social media platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook regularly. At the end of completion of whole teaching schedule, a questionnaire was circulated to obtain the feedback on this teaching method. Finally, the responses were collected and interpreted. RESULTS In the present survey, 257 participants (176 females and 81 males) from 10 medical colleges responded to all 12 items of the questionnaire. We observed that 36 % of them graded excellent for content, 25 % for audio quality, 21 % for video quality, 29 % for specimens used, 25 % for labelling of specimens in YouTube videos. Out of 257 responses 35 % of them were graded excellent for pdf content, 30 % for pictorial representation of brain specimens, 30 % for labelling and 24 % for length. For overall rating for teaching learning method 35 % of them graded 8, 17 % graded 9 and 7 % of them have graded 10. CONCLUSIONS This mode of learning can be used for the purpose of distal education as per the convenience of the students, who are presently staying away from the campus. Our students have taken the benefit of teaching where the PDF and YouTube contents were appreciated by large number of students.","Vidya, C. S.; Bhat, D.; Vamadevaiah, R.

275448,Extra precautions while caring suspected COVID-19 patient in ICU beyond PPE and hand hygiene,2021,"The lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic may have exacerbated mental health problems. To what degree mental health may be affected by social isolation is still poorly known. We collected prospective data on students' mental health in two instances: (i) in October and December 2019, and (ii) 6 months later, in April 2020 amidst the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy and in mid-May/June 2020, after the lifting of lockdown. A total of 358 Italian students aged 18-30 completed socio-demographic questionnaires and the Beck Depression Inventory - 2 (BDI-2), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised (OCI-R), the Eating Habits Questionnaire (EHQ), and the Eating Disorder Inventory-3 (EDI-3). We applied multiple regression models to evince any changes in the aforementioned questionnaire scores during and after lockdown with respect to the scores before lockdown. Students reported on average worse depressive symptoms during lockdown than 6 months before isolation (median increase in the BDI-2 score +2; IQR = -3, 6; ß = 0.09 ± 0.03, p = 0.005), with students without any established diagnosis of psychopathology being affected the most. The regression models predict that 86.2% (IQR = 67.9, 91.4%) of students would not experience a clinically significant worsening of symptoms, while approximately 6% of our target population could develop more severe depressive symptoms. This study supports the view that depressive symptomatology may be aggravated during lockdown, but also highlights that after the lifting of lockdown any changes quickly vanished, as the BDI-2 scores were not different from the ones reported before lockdown.","Meda, Nicola; Pardini, Susanna; Slongo, Irene; Bodini, Luca; Zordan, Mauro Agostino; Rigobello, Paolo; Visioli, Francesco; Novara, Caterina",J Psychiatr Res,,440

275942,Diagnosis of death guidelines for South Africa – timely and necessary,2021,"BACKGROUND: In response to growing anti-vaccine activism on social media, the #DoctorsSpeakUp event was designed to promote pro-vaccine advocacy. This study aimed to analyze Twitter content related to the event to determine (1) characteristics of the Twitter users who authored these tweets, (2) the proportion of tweets expressing pro-vaccine compared to anti-vaccine sentiment, and (3) the content of these tweets. METHODS: Data were collected using Twitter's Filtered Streams Interface, and included all publicly available tweets with the ""#DoctorsSpeakUp"" hashtag on March 5, 2020, the day of the event. Two independent coders assessed a 5% subsample of original tweets (n = 966) using a thematic content analysis approach. Cohen's &#954; ranged 0.71-1.00 for all categories. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to examine associations between tweet sentiment, type of account, and tweet content (personal narrative and/or statement about research or science). Accounts were analyzed for likelihood of being a bot (i.e. automated account) using Botometer. RESULTS: Of 847 (87.7%) relevant tweets, 244 (28.8%) were authored by a Twitter user that identified as a parent and 68 (8.0%) by a user that identified as a health professional. With regard to sentiment, 167 (19.7%) were coded as pro-vaccine and 668 (78.9%) were coded as anti-vaccine. Tweet sentiment was significantly associated with type of account (p < 0.001) and tweet content (p = 0.001). Of the 575 unique users in our dataset, 31 (5.4%) were classified as bots using Botometer. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a highly coordinated response of devoted anti-vaccine antagonists in response to the #DoctorsSpeakUp event. These findings can be used to help vaccine advocates leverage social media more effectively to promote vaccines. Specifically, it would be valuable to ensure that pro-vaccine messages consider hashtag use and pre-develop messages that can be launched and promoted by pro-vaccine advocates.","Hoffman, Beth L; Colditz, Jason B; Shensa, Ariel; Wolynn, Riley; Taneja, Sanya Bathla; Felter, Elizabeth M; Wolynn, Todd; Sidani, Jaime E",Vaccine,,440

But it remains unclear how individual behaviours could exacerbate or protect against adverse changes in mental health. Aims To examine the associations between specific activities (or time use) and mental health and well-being among people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method Data were from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study, a panel study collecting data weekly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analytical sample consisted of 55 204 adults living in the UK who were followed up for the 11-week strict lockdown period from 21 March to 31 May 2020. Data were analysed using fixed-effects and Arellano-Bond models. Results Changes in time spent on a range of activities were associated with changes in mental health and well-being. After controlling for bidirectionality, behaviours involving outdoor activities such as gardening and exercising predicted subsequent improvements in mental health and well-being, whereas increased time spent following news about COVID-19 predicted declines in mental health and well-being. Conclusions These results are relevant to the formulation of guidance for people obliged to spend extended periods in isolation during health emergencies and may help the public to maintain well-being during future lockdowns and pandemics.

286389,Effect of nasal suction catheter use on aerosol generation during endoscopic sinus surgery,2021,"Tight oil reached about 8% of world oil production in 2019, a fraction only lower than Russia and Saudi Arabia. With such a large amount, the fluctuation in tight oil production can substantially influence the balance of the world oil market. However, due to the short history of large-scale tight oil development, the influence of oil prices on tight oil supply is not well studied. This paper analyzes the price responsiveness of tight oil supply in the United States using an econometric method and well-level play-specific panel data. The result is further used to estimate the influence of COVID-19 on tight oil production. The regression results show that the oil price elasticity was 2.0 for tight oil drilling and 0.5 for tight oil production in 2010–2016. The gas price elasticity is insignificant in both cases. Forecasts using the estimated econometric model show that tight oil production will decrease by 1.3–2.3 million barrels per day (16–28%) under different price scenarios. However, tight oil is not likely to be a “swing producer” and OPEC will continue to lead production cuts under low prices. The estimated price elasticities contribute to more accurate forecasts of tight oil supply. The conclusions also have significant policy implications for major oil-producing countries.","Chen, Yan",Resources Policy,,440
286704,Risk factors for poor outcome in older patients admitted in a surgical intensive care unit,2021,"Color-motion asynchrony (CMA) refers to an apparent lag of direction of motion when a dynamic stimulus changes both color and direction at the same time. The subjective order of simultaneous events, however, is not only perceptual but also subject to illusions during voluntary actions. Self-initiated actions, for example, seem to precede their sensory outcomes following an adaptation to a delay between the action and the sensory feedback. Here, we demonstrate that the extent of the apparent asynchrony can be substantially reduced when direction change is induced by a voluntary key press following a delay adaptation regime. We also show that the reduced color-motion asynchrony effect size following a motor-sensory recalibration is not a result of a change in the onset of perceived direction change relative to that of the color. This is particularly important as it implies, for the first time in the literature, that voluntary action is not only important in forming action-sensory outcome associations but may also act as a binding factor between the two perceptual features of a sensory event.","Ayhan, Inci; Kurtcan, Melisa; Thorpe, Lucas",Vision Res,,440

Data from high-income countries (HIC) suggest disruptions to care delivery with reduced stroke admissions and administration of acute stroke reperfusion therapies. We are unaware of any published data on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stroke admissions and outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa. PURPOSE: To compare rates of stroke admissions and case fatality between corresponding periods in 2020 and 2019, within a hospital system in Ghana, to assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We compared monthly stroke admissions and mortality rates between January to June 2020 vs. January to June 2019 at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, a tertiary medical center in Ghana. Predictors of in-patient mortality were assessed using a multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: Stroke admissions were higher in January to June 2020 vs. January to June 2019 (431 vs. 401), an increase of +7.5% (95% CI: 5.1-10.5%). There was also a rise in recurrent stroke admissions in 2020 vs. 2019 (19.0% vs. 10.9%, p = .0026). Stroke case fatality trended higher in 2020 vs. 2019 (29.3% vs. 24.2%, p = .095) with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.22 (95% CI: 0.89-1.68). CONCLUSION: While an influence of secular trends cannot be excluded, the COVID-19 outbreak coincided with a comparatively significant rise in initial and recurrent stroke admissions at this Ghanaian tertiary hospital. Continued surveillance at this hospital, as well as assessment of this issue at other sites in Africa is warranted.","Sarfo, Fred S; Mensah, Naa Oboshie; Opoku, Francis Agyapong; Adusei-Mensah, Nathaniel; Ampofo, Michael; Ovbiagele, Bruce",J Neurol Sci,,440

298433,A national system for monitoring intensive care unit demand and capacity: the Critical Health Resources Information System (CHRIS),2021,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore newly qualified nurses' support needs and their perceptions of online peer support. BACKGROUND: The experience of being a newly qualified nurse is stressful and isolating. Support from colleagues and peers can enhance perceptions of competence and confidence in newly qualified nurses, improve well-being and aid retention. However, despite initiatives such as preceptorship, support needs may remain unmet in busy clinical environments. Online support has potential to offer a partial solution to professional isolation, but there is a lack of research into how technology can support nurses' emotional and social well-being. DESIGN: A qualitative exploratory study was designed, employing semi-structured focus groups, analysed using thematic analysis. The study is reported in accordance with the COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research checklist. METHODS: Eight focus groups, supplemented by one individual interview, were conducted with newly qualified nurses between June 2018-January 2019. FINDINGS: Two main themes arose. The first was Drowning, a lot of the time with two sub-themes: (i) Feelings and emotions about being a Newly Qualified Nurse: 'Absolutely terrified' and (ii) Support within the role: 'Somebody you can count on'. The second was Potential advantages and disadvantages of online modality: 'Somebody is going to get in that phone!' which included three sub-themes (i) Potential advantages, (ii) Potential disadvantages and (iii) Preferences and recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that if barriers can be overcome, then online support has potential to contribute to newly qualified nurses' well-being. Further research is needed to explore technical and ethical issues around online support and evaluate its effectiveness for newly qualified nurses. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Online support has the potential to add to existing strategies to support nurses during stressful times. This may be particularly relevant when many staff are working under increased pressure due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jenkins, Catharine; Oyebode, Jan; Bicknell, Sarah; Webster, Natalie; Bentham, Peter; Smythe, Analisa",J. clin. nurs,,440
298434,A national system for monitoring intensive care unit demand and capacity: the Critical Health Resources Information System (CHRIS),2021,"IMPORTANCE: The infection of medical personnel with COVID-19 was a disaster for both patients and doctors. However, some effective measures can prevent medical staff from becoming infected. This article introduces those measures and thus provides a reference for other hospitals. OBJECTIVE: In order to reduce the risk of occupational exposure and of the infection of medical staff, this article analyzed the factors, causes and experience of medical personnel on their occupational exposure to COVID-19. Some effective and targeted intervention measures can be implemented in order to avoid the occupational exposure of medical staff to COVID-19. EVIDENCE REVIEW: In this single-center case series involving 196 medical personnel, occupational exposure to COVID-19 was present. Nursing staff accounted for 67.35% of those cases. The relationships with an exposure source were found to be as follows: doctors and patients (87.24%), colleagues (10.20%), and roommates (2.55%). Occupational exposure was found to be present in the clinical department, radiology department, central sterile supply department, as well as in the outpatient clinics and operating rooms. The non-surgical departments accounted for 72.96% and direct contact accounted for 84.69% while failure to wear surgical masks (84.18%) and operating on the patient without wearing goggles/face shield (8.16%) were the main causes of occupational exposure. The occurrence of occupational exposure to COVID-19 declined to 0.19% after an extensive and comprehensive intervention program. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Some effective measures such as hand hygiene, wearing surgical masks in and around the hospital, reasonable use of goggles/face screens, raising awareness of protective measures, minimizing the number of elective operations, strengthening training as well as many other control measures were instrumental in reducing occupational exposure. For any medical institution there is room for improvement in terms of personal protection to reduce occupational exposure.","Liu, Huan; Wang, Ya; He, Hong-Yan; Liu, Liang-Bao; Zhang, Qing; Chen, Jia-Li; Liu, Hua",J Infect Public Health,,440

The selected model corresponds to the point in the confidence region of the parameters that minimizes the penalty, making it the least complex model that still has acceptable fit according to the test that defines the confidence region. As the globaltest is particularly powerful in the presence of many weak predictors, it connects well to ridge regression, and we thus focus on ridge penalties in this paper. The confidence region method is quick to calculate, intuitive, and gives decent predictive potential. As a tuning parameter selection method it may even outperform classical methods such as cross-validation in terms of mean squared error of prediction, especially when the signal is weak. We illustrate the method for linear models in simulation study and for Cox models in real gene expression data of breast cancer samples.","Xu, Ningning; Solari, Aldo; Goeman, Jelle",Biom. j,,440
301302,Elements of an Effective Incident Command Center,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To examine changes in Social Media (SoMe) use among urology residency applicants before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We distributed surveys to individuals who applied to our residency program for application cycles ending in 2018, 2019, and 2021. The surveys included questions about applicants' SoMe use and perceptions of programs' SoMe use during the application process, both before (2018/2019) and after (2021) the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome was SoMe use for professional purposes. RESULTS: We received survey responses from 33% (162 of 496) and 29% (84 of 294) of applicants from the 2018/2019 and 2021 cohorts, respectively. There was a significant increase in professional SoMe use in the 2021 cohort (80%) compared with the 2018/2019 cohort (44%) (P < .001). In 2021 compared to 2018/2019, more applicants used SoMe to connect directly with residents (69% vs 34%, P < .001) and with faculty members (65% vs 15%, P < .001). Applicants in 2021 compared to 2018/2019 more often found SoMe to be useful for making decisions about applying to (33% vs 10%), interviewing at (26% vs 7%), and ranking programs (20% vs 9%) (all P < .05). Twitter was the most common platform for applicants to access program information, increasing from 38% to 71%. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a period of unprecedented SoMe usage among urology applicants, who used it to learn about and connect with residency programs in new ways. The use of SoMe by residency programs has become an important component of trainee recruitment and is likely to continue in the future.","Ho, Patrick; Margolin, Ezra; Sebesta, Elisabeth; Small, Alexander; Badalato, Gina M",Urology,,440

However, until now, there is no vaccine or specific drug to prevent or treat COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To find out the effective treatment as an antiviral agent for COVID-19, to determine the correlation between sociodemography with clinical outcomes and duration of treatment, and to determine the relationship between comorbidities with clinical outcomes and duration of treatment for COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in this study. This study included only confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the hospital during April-May 2020. Convenience sampling was used to select 103 patients, but only 72 patients were suitable for inclusion. RESULTS: The survival analysis for COVID-19 patients using the Kaplan Meier method showed that patients receiving Oseltamivir + Hydroxychloroquine had an average survival rate of about 83% after undergoing treatment of about ten days. Gender (p = 0.450) and age (p = 0.226) did not have a significant correlation with the duration of treatment for COVID-19 patients. Gender (p = 0.174) and age (p = 0.065) also did not have a significant correlation with clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. Comorbidities showed a significant correlation with duration of treatment (p = 0.002) and clinical outcome (p = 0.014) of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The most effective antiviral agent in this study based on treatment duration was the combination of Oseltamivir + Hydroxychloroquine. The higher the patient's average treatment duration is, the lower the average survival rate for COVID-19 patients.","Ramatillah, Diana Laila; Isnaini, Suri",PLoS One,,440
303832,Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis with erythema multiforme-like lesions induced by Hydroxychloroquine in a woman with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"BACKGROUND: Smartphone reminding applications can help overcome memory difficulties experienced by people with acquired brain injury (ABI). Cognitive difficulties with memory and attention make entering reminders into a device, and remembering to set reminders, challenging for this group. ApplTree is a reminding app with features that aim to address challenges. One app feature was push notifications (asking ""Do you need to set any reminders?"") to support people to initiate use of the app to set reminders. Another app feature was a customisable user interface design to support attention and short term memory during reminder setting. METHODS: In a mixed-methods user study, five people with self or other reported memory impairment following ABI used ApplTree for at least 4 months. They received push notifications for at least 2 months and no push notifications for at least 2 months. Monthly participant interviews provided insight into user interface preference, app use, and push notification acceptability. RESULTS: Receiving four Push notifications per day doubled number of daily reminders set and four of the five participants found receiving them to be acceptable. This long-term field study uncovered issues relevant for clinicians and designers, including insights into the potential benefits of different user interface designs, the impact of family members on app use, and the importance of perceived need influencing use and acceptance. CONCLUSIONS: Feedback provided insight into future considerations when designing reminding apps and using them in neuropsychological rehabilitation. This work highlights the benefit of user-led research into accessible design and use of assistive technologies. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION ""Unsolicited"" push prompts are an easy to implement feature of reminding technology that is useful and acceptable for people with ABI in community rehabilitation. Observations provide insights about how people with ABI make use of reminding apps over time. This can inform those designing apps or providing reminding technology as part of neuropsychological rehabilitation. Participants differed on their preference of the two user-interface designs available in ApplTree. This highlights an area for future research because currently available reminding apps have a broad-shallow design which may not always be appropriate for people with ABI.","Jamieson, Matthew; Cullen, Breda; Lennon, Marilyn; Brewster, Stephen; Evans, Jonathan",Disabil Rehabil Assist Technol,,440

Like many authors, we adopt the classic epidemic SIR model, where the infection rate is the control variable. Its differential flatness property yields elementary closed-form formulae for open-loop social distancing scenarios, where, for instance, the increase of the number of uninfected people may be taken into account. Those formulae might therefore be useful to decision makers. A feedback loop stemming from model-free control leads to a remarkable robustness with respect to severe uncertainties of various kinds. Although an identification procedure is presented, a good knowledge of the recovery rate is not necessary for our control strategy. Several convincing computer experiments are displayed.","Fliess, Michel; Join, C'edric",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01712v1.pdf,440

Infodemiology metrics have been widely and successfully used to assess and forecast epidemics and outbreaks. OBJECTIVE: In light of the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic that started in Wuhan, China in 2019, online search traffic data from Google are used to track the spread of the new coronavirus disease in Europe. METHODS: Time series from Google Trends from January to March 2020 on the Topic (Virus) of ""Coronavirus"" were retrieved and correlated with official data on COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide and in the European countries that have been affected the most: Italy (at national and regional level), Spain, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Statistically significant correlations are observed between online interest and COVID-19 cases and deaths. Furthermore, a critical point, after which the Pearson correlation coefficient starts declining (even if it is still statistically significant) was identified, indicating that this method is most efficient in regions or countries that have not yet peaked in COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: In the past, infodemiology metrics in general and data from Google Trends in particular have been shown to be useful in tracking and forecasting outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics as, for example, in the cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome, Ebola, measles, and Zika.

Medical professionals, notably junior doctors, are at increased risk of developing poor mental health and burnout. The GMC Barometer Study in 2020 showed that 32% of doctors found the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic detrimental to their wellbeing and mental health.The aim of this quality improvement project was to assess and improve hospital wellbeing support available to foundation doctors within Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (GHNHSFT) by learning and reflecting on the impact of COVID-19.MethodAfter identifying a lack of resources within GHNHSFT, wellbeing information boards were displayed in communal areas and distributed by email. These encompassed trust wide support, practical information including childcare and relaxation resources concentrating on mindfulness, exercise and culture. A survey of foundation doctors was completed to assess doctors’ focus and approach to wellbeing. Questions assessed influential factors in maintaining wellbeing, access to current hospital resources and future interventions.Result94% of respondents recognised that their focus on wellbeing increased during COVID-19. One third of foundation doctors found it challenging to maintain their wellbeing, with 40% reporting difficulty accessing hospital support and advice. The most important factors foundation doctors identified in maintaining wellbeing were exercise, cooking and baking, and social networks. Colleagues were a significant source of wellbeing support, followed by notice boards, email resources and social media.ConclusionCOVID-19 highlighted the importance and burden on wellbeing of foundation doctors, with a significant number struggling to access support. Future recommendations include the use of a ‘buddy system’, regular and accessible exercise classes and improved communication of wellbeing support and resources to staff members.Buddy systems have already shown success amongst teams however it is important these are accessible to all foundation doctors and universally offered within the trust. A weekly yoga class is being reintroduced to be available to all doctors.A particular focus has been the development of a health and wellbeing section to feature in the trusts weekly communications, with the aim to regularly signpost staff to ongoing wellbeing resources and support.Social networking and media were highlighted as important in both maintaining wellbeing and accessing resources. A future goal is to develop an official GHNHSFT Instagram or Twitter account focused on wellbeing. We hope to continue to learn from the impact of COVID-19, improving the availability of wellbeing support at GHNHSFT that will continue into the future.","Abbi, Graham Anna-Marie Dale",BJPsych Open,,440

316598,Pondering the atypicality of ARDS in COVID-19 is a distraction for the bedside doctor,2021,"The quantitation of metanephrine (MN), normetanephrine (NMN), and 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) - referred to as metanephrines -- by LC-MS/MS is the gold-standard for screening for pheochromocytoma and paragangliomas (PPGLs), tumours of the adrenal gland and the peripheral nervous system. An assay for metanephrines from dried blood spots (DBSs) would be of high clinical utility as it simplifies sample collection, enables remote sampling, and could increase compliance with the clinical recommendation for supine sampling. Moreover, DBS sampling facilitates the measurement of blood-derived metanephrines in pediatric patients - where DBSs are well-established - in order to diagnose neuroblastomas. Here, we adapted an established derivatization-based LC-MRM-MS assay for plasma catecholamines, and optimized the sample extraction, LC, and MS parameters to produce a fast, sensitive, and robust method for the measurement of metanephrines from DBSs, including 3-methoxytyramine. The DBS samples were excised, derivatized with phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC) on-spot, extracted, and measured by LC-MRM-MS. To validate assay suitability and performance, we assessed the linearity, precision, accuracy, recovery, and matrix effects of the method, and determined the stability of metanephrines in DBSs under different storage conditions. Assay performance for NMN, MN, and 3-MT was sufficient for quantitation from a single DBS within a linear range from 40 to 2000 pg/mL. MN and NMN were stable in DBSs for 2 weeks, whereas 3-MT was stable for one week regardless of storage temperature. Altogether, this work represents the first quantitative LC-MS/MS method for metanephrines from DBSs and provides a novel opportunity for the diagnosis of PPGLs and neuroblastomas in the future.","Richard, Vincent R; Zahedi, René P; Eintracht, Shaun; Borchers, Christoph H",Anal Chim Acta,,440
317085,Safety and efficacy of herbal extracts to restore respiratory health and improve innate immunity in COVID-19 positive patients with mild to moderate severity: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,2020,"COVID-19 pandemic poses a significant mental health threat among children in Bangladesh. This study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of children during the lockdown in Bangladesh. An online cross-sectional study was conducted from 25th April to 9th May 2020 among 384 parents having at least one child aged between 5–15 years using non-probability sampling. K-means clustering used to group children according to mental health score and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) performed to identify the relationship among the parental behavior and child mental health, and also these associations were assessed through chi-square test. Children were classified into four groups where 43% of child had subthreshold mental disturbances (mean Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)-10; 2.8), 30.5% had mild (mean MDD-10; 8.9), 19.3% suffered moderately (mean MDD-10; 15.9), and 7.2% of child suffered from severe disturbances (mean MDD-10; 25.2). The higher percentage of mental health disturbances of children with the higher education level of parents, relative infected by COVID-19 (yes), parents still need to go the workplace (yes), and parent's abnormal behavior but lower to their counterparts. This paper demonstrates large proportions of children are suffering from mental health disturbances in Bangladesh during the period of lockdown. Implementation of psychological intervention strategies and improvement in house-hold financial conditions, literacy of parents, taking care of children, and job security may help in improving the psychological/mental status of children and the authors believe that the findings will be beneficial to accelerate the rate of achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) linked to health status in Bangladesh.","Yeasmin, Sabina; Banik, Rajon; Hossain, Sorif; Hossain, Md.

321279,Canadian Emergency Medicine and Critical Care Physician Perspectives on Pandemic Triage in Covid-19,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replicates throughout human airways. The polarized human airway epithelium (HAE) cultured at an airway-liquid interface (HAE-ALI) is an in vitro model mimicking the in vivo human mucociliary airway epithelium and supports the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Prior studies characterized only short-period SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE. In this study, continuously monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE-ALI cultures for a long period of up to 51 days revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection was long lasting with recurrent replication peaks appearing between an interval of approximately 7 to 10 days, which was consistent in all the tested HAE-ALI cultures derived from 4 lung bronchi of independent donors. We also identified that SARS-CoV-2 does not infect HAE from the basolateral side, and the dominant SARS-CoV-2 permissive epithelial cells are ciliated cells and goblet cells, whereas virus replication in basal cells and club cells was not detected. Notably, virus infection immediately damaged the HAE, which is demonstrated by dispersed zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression without clear tight junctions and partial loss of cilia. Importantly, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 productive infection of HAE requires a high viral load of >2.5 × 105 virions per cm2 of epithelium. Thus, our studies highlight the importance of a high viral load and that epithelial renewal initiates and maintains a recurrent infection of HAE with SARS-CoV-2.IMPORTANCE The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to >35 million confirmed cases and >1 million fatalities worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 mainly replicates in human airway epithelia in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we used in vitro cultures of polarized human bronchial airway epithelium to model SARS-CoV-2 replication for a period of 21 to 51 days. We discovered that in vitro airway epithelial cultures endure a long-lasting SARS-CoV-2 propagation with recurrent peaks of progeny virus release at an interval of approximately 7 to 10 days. Our study also revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes airway epithelia damage with disruption of tight junction function and loss of cilia. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a polarity of infection in airway epithelium only from the apical membrane; it infects ciliated and goblet cells but not basal and club cells. Furthermore, the productive infection of SARS-CoV-2 requires a high viral load of over 2.5 × 105 virions per cm2 of epithelium. Our study highlights that the proliferation of airway basal cells and regeneration of airway epithelium may contribute to the recurrent infections.","Hao, Siyuan; Ning, Kang; Kuz, Cagla Aksu; Vorhies, Kai; Yan, Ziying; Qiu, Jianming",mBio (Online),,440

323067,Corrigendum to the Ventilator Management Team: Repurposing Anesthesia Workstations and Personnel to Combat COVID-19,2020,"It is striking that all marketed SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are developed for intramuscular administration designed to produce humoral and cell mediated immune responses, preventing viremia and the COVID-19 syndrome. They have a high degree of efficacy in humans (70-95%) depending on the type of vaccine. However, little protection is provided against viral replication and shedding in the upper airways due to the lack of a local sIgA immune response, indicating a risk of transmission of virus from vaccinated individuals. A range of novel nasal COVID-19 vaccines are in development and preclinical results in non-human primates have shown a promising prevention of replication and shedding of virus due to the induction of mucosal immune response (sIgA) in upper and lower respiratory tracts as well as robust systemic and humoral immune responses. Whether these results will translate to humans remains to be clarified. An IM prime followed by an IN booster vaccination would likely result in a better well-rounded immune response, including prevention (or strong reduction) in viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts.","Tiboni, Mattia; Casettari, Luca; Illum, Lisbeth",Int J Pharm,,440
323472,Antibody tests for identification of current and past infection with SARS‐CoV‐2,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects billions of lives around the world and has a significant impact on public healthcare. Due to rising skepticism towards the sensitivity of RT-PCR as screening method, medical imaging like computed tomography offers great potential as alternative. For this reason, automated image segmentation is highly desired as clinical decision support for quantitative assessment and disease monitoring. However, publicly available COVID-19 imaging data is limited which leads to overfitting of traditional approaches. To address this problem, we propose an innovative automated segmentation pipeline for COVID-19 infected regions, which is able to handle small datasets by utilization as variant databases. Our method focuses on on-the-fly generation of unique and random image patches for training by performing several preprocessing methods and exploiting extensive data augmentation. For further reduction of the overfitting risk, we implemented a standard 3D U-Net architecture instead of new or computational complex neural network architectures. Through a 5-fold cross-validation on 20 CT scans of COVID-19 patients, we were able to develop a highly accurate as well as robust segmentation model for lungs and COVID-19 infected regions without overfitting on the limited data. Our method achieved Dice similarity coefficients of 0.956 for lungs and 0.761 for infection. We demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms related approaches, advances the state-of-the-art for COVID-19 segmentation and improves medical image analysis with limited data.

This quantitative study examined types of learners' data that higher education instructors have access to, are interested in, and decisions they would consider making upon exposure to, while comparing emergency remote teaching with traditional teaching. Data were collected via an online questionnaire distributed among higher education instructors during the first COVID‐19 outbreak (&lt;italic&gt;N&lt;/italic&gt; = 195, affiliated with 108 different academic institutions in 35 countries). Instructors were requested to refer to a face‐to‐face course that was shifted under these emergency circumstances to online teaching. Findings indicated a broader access to learners' data while teaching the course face‐to‐face and a slightly greater interest in learners' data while teaching the course in an emergency remote teaching mode. These complimentary findings depict a situation in which instructors lack face‐to‐face cues about their students without accessing alternative sources of data. Moreover, when teaching online versus face‐to‐face, instructors showed more interest and higher intention to make decisions based on data about learners' collaborative learning and social and emotional support, which highlights instructors' interest in aspects of learning that are less visible during online teaching.

The impact of New Zealand's strict lockdown measures to contain COVID-19 on perceived stress and PD motor symptoms remains unknown. Here we examined the relationship between perceived levels of stress, changes in physical activity levels and PD motor symptoms during lockdown. METHODS: During lockdown, 134 participants with PD and 49 controls completed a survey assessing perceived stress, self-reported changes in PD motor symptoms and physical activity duration and intensity prior to and during lockdown. RESULTS: Perceived stress was higher in PD than controls, and in those reporting a worsening of tremor, balance/gait, dyskinesia and bradykinesia compared to those indicating no change during the COVID-19 lockdown. These effects were not modulated by physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing stressors may be an important adjunct treatment strategy to improve motor function in PD.","Blakemore, R. L.; Pascoe, M.

330508,Preventing infectious diseases in Intensive Care Unit by medical devices remote control: Lessons from COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an antimalarial drug that received worldwide news and media attention in the treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This drug was used on the basis of its antimicrobial and antiviral properties despite lack of definite evidence of clinical efficacy. In this study, we aim to assess the efficacy and safety of using HCQ in treatment of patients with COVID-19 who were admitted in acute care hospitals in Bahrain. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on a random sample of patients admitted with COVID-19 between 24 February and 31 July 2020. The study was conducted in four acute care COVID-19 hospitals in Bahrain. Data was extracted from the medical records. The primary endpoint was the requirement of non-invasive ventilation, intubation, or death. Secondary endpoint was length of hospitalization for survivors. Three methods of analysis were used to control for confounding factors: logistic multivariate regression, propensity score adjusted regression, and matched propensity score analysis. RESULTS: A random sample of 1571 patients were included, 440 of whom received HCQ (treatment group) and 1131 did not receive it (control group). Our results showed that HCQ did not have a significant effect on primary outcomes due to COVID-19 infection when compared to controls after adjusting for confounders (OR 1.43, 95% CI 0.85-2.37, P = 0.17). Co-administration of azithromycin had no effect on primary outcomes (OR 2.7, 95% CI 0.82-8.85, P = 0.10). HCQ was associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia (OR 10.9, 95% CI 1.72-69.49, P = 0.011) and diarrhea (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.4-5.5, P = 0.003), but not QT prolongation (OR 1.92, 95% CI 0.95-3.9, P = 0.06) or cardiac arrhythmia (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.55-2.05, P = 0.85). CONCLUSION: Our results showed no significant beneficial effect of using hydroxychloroquine on the outcome of patients with COVID-19. Moreover, the risk of hypoglycemia due to hydroxychloroquine would possess a significant risk for out-of-hospital use.","Abdulrahman, Abdulkarim; AlSayed, Islam; AlMadhi, Marwa; AlArayed, Jumana; Mohammed, Sara Jaafar; Sharif, Aesha Khalid; Alansari, Khadija; AlAwadhi, Abdulla Ismael; AlQahtani, Manaf",,,440

Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been identified as a gold standard test with Chest CT and Chest Radiography showing promising results as well. However, radiological solutions have not been used extensively for the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease, partly due to radiation risk. This study aimed to provide quantitative comparison of imaging radiation risk versus COVID risk. METHODS: The analysis was performed in terms of mortality rate per age group. COVID-19 mortality was extracted from epidemiological data across 299,004 patients published by ISS-Integrated surveillance of COVID-19 in Italy. For radiological risk, the study considered 659 Chest CT performed in adult patients. Organ doses were estimated using a Monte Carlo method and then used to calculate Risk Index that was converted into an upper bound for related mortality rate following NCI-SEER data. RESULTS: COVID-19 mortality showed a rapid rise for ages >30 years old (min:0.30%; max:30.20%), whereas only 1 death was reported in the analyzed patient cohort for ages <20 years old. The rates decreased for radiation risk across age groups. The median mortality rate across all ages for Chest-CT and Chest-Radiography were 0.007% (min:0.005%; max:0.011%) and 0.0003% (min:0.0002%; max:0.0004%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19, Chest Radiography, and Chest CT mortality rates showed different magnitudes and trends across age groups. In higher ages, the risk of COVID-19 far outweighs that of radiological exams. Based on risk comparison alone, Chest Radiography and CT for COVID-19 care is justified for patients older than 20 and 30 years old, respectively. Notwithstanding other aspects of diagnosis, the present results capture a component of risk consideration associated with the use of imaging for COVID. Once integrated with other diagnostic factors, they may help inform better management of the pandemic.","Ria, Francesco; Fu, Wanyi; Chalian, Hamid; Abadi, Ehsan; Segars, Paul W; Fricks, Rafael; Khoshpouri, Pegah; Samei, Ehsan",J. radiol. prot,,440

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted at the Pediatric Endocrinology Department of a third-level University Hospital in Rome, including children and adolescents with overweight and obesity. Personal, anthropometrics data and other information about physical activity, eating habits and psychological aspects were collected. RESULTS: We included in our study 64 participants, of which 33 (51.6%) were patients with overweight and 31 (48.4%) with obesity. We divided patients in two groups: patients with pre-versus post-lockdown &#916;-BMI > 0 (31, 48.4%) and patients with &#916;-BMI < 0 (33, 51.6%). Our data showed that patients whose BMI increased were more sedentary (p=0.024 for physical activity and p=0.005 for hours spent with videogames) during the pandemic. As for the eating habits more than half of the subjects (67.2%) had increased the consumption of homemade desserts, bread, pasta and pizza, and a worse diet was found in patients with BMI gain (p=0.000). Regarding the psychic condition the 80% of patients reported psychological discomfort, and patients with an increase in BMI had episodes of emotional feeding more frequently (p=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID19 pandemic has had disastrous effects not only directly, but also indirectly through the lockdown especially on some categories, such as adolescents with overweight and obesity. The results indicate that it also causes significant changes in lifestyle, physical inactivity and psychological problems among children and adolescents with obesity/overweight.","Cipolla, Clelia; Curatola, Antonietta; Ferretti, Serena; Giugno, Giulia; Condemi, Chiara; Delogu, Angelica Bibiana; Birritella, Lisa; Lazzareschi, Ilaria",Acta Biomed,,440

The main contribution of this research is the comparative evaluation of on-grid decentralized or distributed renewable-powered desalination systems for sustainable water and energy supply planning. Applying a novel nexus approach, an interactive multi-period planning model is developed to highlight synergies and to identify conflicts of planning both energy and water sectors at the same time as endogenous subsystems of one overall system. For studying these synergies in this study, the pace of technology deployment and the path of decline in overall costs are assumed to be a function of experience and knowledge as two-factor learning curves. Using data from 81 projects, the levelized cost and capacity factor of utility-scale photovoltaic and wind supplies in the Middle East were calculated. The results indicate that a scenario with a decentralized water sector and renewable-powered multiple-effect distillation technology has the best overall performance among the proposed scenarios.","Ahmadi, Esmaeil; McLellan, Benjamin; Ogata, Seiichi; Mohammadi-Ivatloo, Behnam; Tezuka, Tetsuo",Sustainability,,440

So far, it has killed 7,37,417 number of individuals. High variability in the viral genome and its greater ability to spread in the human community is badly affecting the comorbid individuals. Although infected individuals are mainly possessing respiratory issues, neurological manifestations in these individuals cannot be overlooked. The literature search is based on the recent development in the concerned field. We searched databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect using the keywords ""COVID-19"", ""neurological manifestations"", ""CNS"", and ""PNS"". The major neurological complications observed in these patients are encephalitis, necrotising haemorrhagic encephalopathy, Guillain Barre Syndrome, smell/taste impairment, epileptic seizures, and abnormal states of consciousness. COVID-19 infection is just more than a cough, fever, and respiratory illness; it can cause indirect neurological complications in infected patients. It is therefore advised to treat and have a careful observation of the COVID-19 patients for neurological manifestations.","Kumar, Saurabh; Dwivedi, Divya; Chopra, Madhu","CNS neurol. disord., Drug targets (Online)",,440
345572,Between-centre differences for COVID-19 ICU mortality from early data in England,2020,"BACKGROUND: Over 40â000 patients with COVID-19 have been hospitalised in New York City (NY, USA) as of April 28, 2020. Data on the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this setting are needed. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study took place at two NewYork-Presbyterian hospitals affiliated with Columbia University Irving Medical Center in northern Manhattan. We prospectively identified adult patients (aged &#8805;18 years) admitted to both hospitals from March 2 to April 1, 2020, who were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and were critically ill with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, and collected clinical, biomarker, and treatment data. The primary outcome was the rate of in-hospital death. Secondary outcomes included frequency and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, frequency of vasopressor use and renal replacement therapy, and time to in-hospital clinical deterioration following admission. The relation between clinical risk factors, biomarkers, and in-hospital mortality was modelled using Cox proportional hazards regression. Follow-up time was right-censored on April 28, 2020 so that each patient had at least 28 days of observation. FINDINGS: Between March 2 and April 1, 2020, 1150 adults were admitted to both hospitals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, of which 257 (22%) were critically ill. The median age of patients was 62 years (IQR 51-72), 171 (67%) were men. 212 (82%) patients had at least one chronic illness, the most common of which were hypertension (162 [63%]) and diabetes (92 [36%]). 119 (46%) patients had obesity. As of April 28, 2020, 101 (39%) patients had died and 94 (37%) remained hospitalised. 203 (79%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 18 days (IQR 9-28), 170 (66%) of 257 patients received vasopressors and 79 (31%) received renal replacement therapy. The median time to in-hospital deterioration was 3 days (IQR 1-6). In the multivariable Cox model, older age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1·31 [1·09-1·57] per 10-year increase), chronic cardiac disease (aHR 1·76 [1·08-2·86]), chronic pulmonary disease (aHR 2·94 [1·48-5·84]), higher concentrations of interleukin-6 (aHR 1·11 [95%CI 1·02-1·20] per decile increase), and higher concentrations of D-dimer (aHR 1·10 [1·01-1·19] per decile increase) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. INTERPRETATION: Critical illness among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in New York City is common and associated with a high frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation, extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, and substantial in-hospital mortality.

Half of these deaths occur suddenly and a large percentage in the out-of-hospital setting. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the access of the general population to learn-ing simple and pragmatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers and the presence of automated external defibrillators translate into a large increase in survival without sequelae in victims of sudden out-of-hospital cardiac death. Today the special situation represented by the COVID-19 pandemic questions all we have learned so far and faces us with two extremely complex situations. On the one hand, the cardiovascular involvement and the consequent increase in malignant ventricular arrhythmias generated by this infection, both in healthy patients and in those with pre-existent diseases, have led to an increase in the incidence of sudden out-of-hospital death. On the other hand, it forces us to rethink all the actions set in motion at the moment a patient presents with an episode of sudden out-of-hospital cardiac death, as the possibility of transmission of this highly contagious disease is now added during the resuscitation maneuvers. Finding a risk-benefit balance that allows increasing the patient’s survival with the least pos-sible risk for the person who is performing the resuscitation is the real challenge we are encountering today.","Maurice, Mario D.

Alcohol production, sales, and purchase were barred with this overnight prohibition order. We conducted a qualitative analysis of the media reports published within the first month of the nationwide lockdown with the objectives (a) using the media reports as indications of possible public health impact and population response of a sudden alcohol prohibition in India, (b) suggesting areas for future research. METHODS: We performed thematic and content analysis of 350 articles published online in national newspapers between the 26th March, 2020 and 25th April, 2020. Initial inductive, followed by deductive coding was done in this exploratory thematic analysis. RESULTS: The thematic analysis revealed four main themes: the beneficial aspects of the policy, the harmful aspects of the policy, non-compliance and attempts to change and / or subvert the policy, popularity and level of public buy-in of the policy. We generated relevant sub-themes under main themes. Two additional themes, not directly related to the sudden prohibition, were use of stigmatizing language and ethical concerns. The content analysis showed the frequency of the appearance of the main themes and proportions of sub-themes and codes under those main themes. CONCLUSION: The harms, perceived from the media reports, should be balanced against the potential benefits. Absence of a national-level alcohol policy was made apparent by the reflexive, disconnected , and conflictual measures. Future research could systematically examine the potential ramifications of alcohol prohibition on public health, social, and economic aspects.","Ghosh, Abhishek; Choudhury, Shinjini; Basu, Aniruddha; Mahintamani, Tathagata; Sharma, Kshitiz; Pillai, Renjith R; Basu, Debasish; Mattoo, S K",Int J Drug Policy,,440

There are currently no specific registered antiviral drugs to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Therefore, drug repurposing would be the fastest route to provide at least a temporary solution while better, more specific drugs are being developed. Here, we demonstrate that the antiparasitic drug suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, protecting Vero E6 cells with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of â¼20 µM, which is well below the maximum attainable level in human serum. Suramin also decreased the viral load by 2 to 3 logs when Vero E6 cells or cells of a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3 2B4 [referred to here as ""Calu-3""]) were treated. Time-of-addition and plaque reduction assays performed on Vero E6 cells showed that suramin acts on early steps of the replication cycle, possibly preventing binding or entry of the virus. In a primary human airway epithelial cell culture model, suramin also inhibited the progression of infection. The results of our preclinical study warrant further investigation and suggest that it is worth evaluating whether suramin provides any benefit for COVID-19 patients, which obviously requires safety studies and well-designed, properly controlled randomized clinical trials.","Salgado-Benvindo, Clarisse; Thaler, Melissa; Tas, Ali; Ogando, Natacha S; Bredenbeek, Peter J; Ninaber, Dennis K; Wang, Ying; Hiemstra, Pieter S; Snijder, Eric J; van Hemert, Martijn J",,,440

SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Associated Coronavirus) is a member of the coronavirus family, so its study is useful for relevant virus data research. In this work, we conduct a proposed approach that is non-medical/clinical, generate graphs from five features of the SARS outbreak data in five countries and regions, and offer insights from a visual analysis perspective. The results show that prevention measures such as quarantine are the most common control policies used, and areas with strict measures did have fewer peak period days; for instance, Hong Kong handled the outbreak better than other areas. Data conflict issues found with this approach are discussed as well.

354119,Nursing Activities Score is increased in COVID-19 patients,2020,"ABSTRACT: Clinical training is a key component of nurse practitioner (NP) education. The rapid shift to telehealth necessitated by the pandemic has also created a need for socially distanced education and precepting. This article presents teleprecepting as a modality for clinical opportunities and connecting students to previously limited experiences, such as training in small specialties, in rural areas, and with interdisciplinary teams. Precepting NP students using telehealth follows similar principles as in-person teaching, but some modifications and additional considerations are needed to transition to the virtual environment. At a time when many NPs have swiftly adapted to telehealth in practice, this article will offer a brief ""how-to"" for teleprecepting. Prior to COVID-19, teleprecepting was piloted with less than 2% of NP students in the school's pilot teleprecepting project. Seven months after the initial surge of cases and restrictions, 72% of students (n = 151) in the family nurse practitioner, psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner, and pediatric nurse practitioner specialties had transitioned to teleprecepting. This project was implemented rapidly during the pandemic, and thus, evaluations comparing competency outcomes and experiences of students and preceptors are still in process. Additionally, feasibility of this educational model may change as telehealth regulations continue to evolve. COVID-19 poses challenges for both patient care and clinical training of NP students across specialties. With some adaptation, clinical placements can be transitioned to the virtual environment of telehealth. Future studies should examine student competencies based on teleprecepting experiences and preceptor training to support teleprecepting roles.","Johnson, Deborah; Gatewood, Elizabeth; Ling, Amanda; Kuo, Angel Chen",J Am Assoc Nurse Pract (Online),,440
354651,Response from Authors,2021,"PURPOSE: At the time of writing, there is a pandemic affecting virtually every country on Earth. There is considerable discussion amongst clinicians as well as lay people about anosmia and ageusia in COVID-19 sufferers. We aimed to report the results from comprehensive olfactory and gustatory testing in a series of hospital in-patients. METHODS: The prospective study evaluated 81 individuals with a COVID-19 infection, as confirmed by 2019 n-cov Real-Time PCR laboratory testing. The control group consisted of forty individuals with COVID-19 negative. Olfactory and gustatory testings were carried out by an examiner utilizing stringent safety standards and wearing full personal protective equipment. The results obtained in the case group were then compared with those obtained for the controls. RESULTS: In the case group, 41(50.6%) of patients were male and 40 (49.4%) were female, mean age of 54.16 ± 16.98 years (18-95). In the control group, 21 (52.5%) of subjects were male and 19 (47.5%) were female, and mean age was 55 ± 15.39 years (18-90). Fifty (61.7%) COVID-19-positive patients had complaints related to olfaction. The distribution of olfactory symptoms in the case group differed at the level of statistical significance from the control group (p < 0.001). Turning to gustatory abnormalities, within the case group, 22 individuals (27.2%) had taste malfunction. A statistically significant difference was found in the distribution of gustatory abnormalities between cases and controls (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

One year into the pandemic, it was clear that all patients-those hospitalized with COVID-19 and those who lived with the disease in the community-were at risk of developing debilitating sequelae that would impact their quality of life. Patients with long COVID asked for rehabilitation. Many of them, including previously healthy and fit clinicians, tried to fight postviral fatigue with exercise-based rehabilitation. We observed a growing number of patients with long COVID who experienced adverse effects from exercise therapy and symptoms strikingly similar to those of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). Community-based physical therapists, including those in private practice, unaware of safety issues, are preparing to help an influx of patients with long COVID. In this editorial, we expose growing concerns about long COVID and ME. We issue safety recommendations for rehabilitation and share resources to improve care for those with postviral illnesses.

For this reason, its trade is critical to many countries in order to fulfil their internal demand and strategic stocks. In this paper, we use complex network analysis tools to study the international wheat trade network and its evolving characteristics for the period 2009-2013. To understand the vulnerability of each country's dependence on the imports of this crop we have performed different analyses, simulating shocks of varying intensities for the main wheat producers, and observed the population affected by the production drop. As a result, we conclude that globally the network is slightly more resilient than four years previously, although at the same time some developing countries have slipped into a vulnerable situation. We have also analysed the effects of a global shock affecting all major producers, assessing its impact on every country. Some comments on the COVID-19 outbreak and the political decisions taken by governments following the pandemic declaration are included, observing that given their capital-intensive characteristics, no negative effects should currently be expected in the wheat market.

358830,Why participation in an international clinical trial platform matters during a pandemic? Launching REMAP-CAP in Japan,2021,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases without effective therapies. Immunotherapies using antibodies to lower assembled Aß provide a promising approach and have been widely studied. Anti-amyloid antibodies are often selective to amyloid conformation, and the lack of amyloid-antibody structural information limits our understanding of these antibodies' conformation selection. Gantenerumab and crenezumab are two anti-Aß antibodies that bind multi-forms of Aß, with different Aß epitope preferences. Here, using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, we study the binding of two antibodies to Aß1-40 fibril, whose conformation is derived from AD patient's brain tissue. We find that gantenerumab recognizes Aß1-11 monomer fragment only in slightly lower pH than physiological environment where His6 of Aß1-11 is protonated. Both gantenerumab and crenezumab bind with integrated Aß fibril rather than bind to monomers within the fibril. Gantenerumab preferentially binds to the N-terminal region of the Aß1-40 fibril, which is driven by aromatic interactions. Crenezumab can recognize the N-terminal region, as well as the cross-section of the Aß1-40 fibril, indicating its multiple binding modes in Aß fibril recognition. These results demonstrate that conformation-dependent interactions of antibody-amyloid recognition.","Chen, Yujie; Wei, Guanghong; Zhao, Jun; Nussinov, Ruth; Ma, Buyong",ACS chem. neurosci,,440

Policymakers and DPT operators need to know whether their system works as expected in terms of speed or yield (performance) and whether DPT is making an effective contribution to pandemic mitigation (also in comparison to and beyond established mitigation measures, particularly manual contact tracing). Thereby, performance and effectiveness are not to be confused. Not only are there conceptual differences but also diverse data requirements. This article describes differences between performance and effectiveness measures and attempts to develop a terminology and classification system for DPT evaluation. We discuss key aspects for critical assessments of whether the integration of additional data measurements into DPT apps - beyond what is required to fulfill its primary notification role - may facilitate an understanding of performance and effectiveness of planned and deployed DPT apps. Therefore, the terminology and a classification matrix may offer some guidance to DPT system operators regarding which measurements to prioritize. DPT developers and operators may also make conscious decisions to integrate measures for epidemic monitoring but should be aware that this introduces a secondary purpose to DPT that is not part of the original DPT design. Ultimately, the integration of further information for epidemic monitoring into DPT involves a trade-off between data granularity and linkage on the one hand, and privacy on the other. Decision-makers should be aware of the trade-off and take it into account when planning and developing DPT notification and monitoring systems or intending to assess the added value of DPT relative to existing contact tracing systems.","Benzler, Justus; Bogdanov, Dan; Kirchner, Goran; Lueks, Wouter; Lucas, Raquel; Oliveira, Rui; Preneel, Bart; Salathe, Marcel; Troncoso, Carmela; Wyl, Viktor von",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12927v1.pdf,440
368072,Transitioning trainees from the operating room to the COVID-19 intensive care unit in New York - Correspondence,2021,"Digital health is a rapidly emerging field that offers several promising potentials: health care delivery remotely, in urban and rural areas, in any time zone, and in times of pandemics and ecological crises. Digital health encompasses electronic health, computing science, big data, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, to name but a few technical components. Digital health is part of a vision for systems medicine. The advances in digital health have been, however, uneven and highly variable across communities, countries, medical specialties, and societal contexts. This article critically examines the determinants of digital health (DDH). DDH describes and critically responds to inequities and differences in digital health theory and practice across people, places, spaces, and time. DDH is not limited to studying variability in design and access to digital technologies. DDH is situated within a larger context of the political determinants of health. Hence, this article presents an analysis of DDH, as seen through political science, and the feminist studies of technology and society. A feminist lens would strengthen systems-driven, historically and critically informed governance for DDH. This would be a timely antidote against unchecked destructive/extractive governance narratives (e.g., technocracy and patriarchy) that produce and reproduce the health inequities. Moreover, feminist framing of DDH can help cultivate epistemic competence to detect and reject false equivalences in how we understand the emerging digital world(s). False equivalence, very common in the current pandemic and post-truth era, is a type of flawed reasoning in decision-making where equal weight is given to arguments with concrete material evidence, and those that are conjecture, untrue, or unjust. A feminist conceptual lens on DDH would help remedy what I refer to in this article as ""the normative deficits"" in science and technology policy that became endemic with the rise of neoliberal governance since the 1980s in particular. In this context, it is helpful to recall the feminist writer Ursula K. Le Guin. Le Guin posed ""what if?"" questions, to break free from oppressive narratives such as patriarchy and re-imagine technology futures. It is time to envision an emancipated, equitable, and more democratic world by asking ""what if we lived in a feminist world?"" That would be truly awesome, for everyone, women and men, children, youth, and future generations, to steer digital technologies and the new field of DDH toward broadly relevant, ethical, experiential, democratic, and socially responsive health outcomes.","Özdemir, Vural",OMICS,,440

To further examine this, we prospectively studied adults from four clinical centers surviving three months and more after hospitalization with or without AKI who were matched on center, pre-admission CKD status, and an integrated priority score based on age, prior cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus, preadmission estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and treatment in the intensive care unit during the index hospitalization between December 2009-February 2015, with follow-up through November 2018. All participants had assessments of kidney function before (eGFR) and at three months and annually (eGFR and proteinuria) after the index hospitalization. Associations of AKI with outcomes were examined after accounting for pre-admission and three-month post-discharge factors. Among 769 AKI (73% Stage 1, 14% Stage 2, 13% Stage 3) and 769 matched non-AKI adults, AKI was associated with higher adjusted rates of incident CKD (adjusted hazard ratio 3.98, 95% confidence interval 2.51-6.31), CKD progression (2.37,1.28-4.39), heart failure events (1.68, 1.22-2.31) and all-cause death (1.78, 1.24-2.56). AKI was not associated with major atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in multivariable analysis (0.95, 0.70-1.28). After accounting for degree of kidney function recovery and proteinuria at three months after discharge, the associations of AKI with heart failure (1.13, 0.80-1.61) and death (1.29, 0.84-1.98) were attenuated and no longer significant. Thus, assessing kidney function recovery and proteinuria status three months after AKI provides important prognostic information for long-term clinical outcomes.","Ikizler, T Alp; Parikh, Chirag R; Himmelfarb, Jonathan; Chinchilli, Vernon M; Liu, Kathleen D; Coca, Steven G; Garg, Amit X; Hsu, Chi-Yuan; Siew, Edward D; Wurfel, Mark M; Ware, Lorraine B; Faulkner, Georgia Brown; Tan, Thida C; Kaufman, James S; Kimmel, Paul L; Go, Alan S",Kidney int,,440

However, limited evidence revealed the PSPH influence on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, we observed that PSPH expression was upregulated in both HCC tissues and cell lines, which was determined by Western blotting. TCGA database showed that the PSPH protein levels were significantly upregulated and affected patient survival rates in HCC. Then gain- and loss-of-function manipulations were performed by transfection with a pcDNA-PSPH expression vector or a specific siRNA against PSPH in Huh7 cells. Huh7 cell proliferation, stemness, invasion and apoptosis were assessed by using CCK-8 test, colony formation assay, Transwell assay and Flow cytometry analysis, respectively, and levels of autophagy-related proteins were detected by using Western blotting. The results showed that PSPH could induce Huh7 cell autophagy, promote cell proliferation and invasion, and inhibit apoptosis. Knockdown of PSPH could inhibit Huh7 cell proliferation, invasion, and autophagy. Furthermore, PSPH activated Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and TGF beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), affected the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathway, but could not activate calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) in Huh7 cells. Inhibition of either LKB1, TAK1, or AMPK could eliminate the effect of PSPH overexpression on Huh7 cell behaviors. However, inhibition of CaMKK could not influence the effect of PSPH overexpression on Huh7 cell behaviors. In conclusion, PSPH could induce autophagy, promote proliferation and invasion, and inhibit apoptosis in HCC cell via the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathway. This article is protected by copyright.

381233,COVID-Lung: The Battlefield,2020,"BACKGROUND: Various techniques are employed in order to support contact tracing, which has been shown to be highly effective against the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To apply the technology, either the quarantine authorities should provide the location history COVID-19 patients, or all people should provide their own location history. This inevitably makes people either the patient location history or personal location history of the public, leading to the privacy protection issue of information release for the public good against privacy exposure risks. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to develop an effective contact tracing system without exposing the location information between the user and the quarantine authorities with COVID-19 patient location history. METHODS: We propose a new protocol called PRivacy Oriented Technique for Epidemic Contact Tracing (PROTECT) that securely shares the location information of patients with users by using the Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) homomorphic encryption scheme, along with a new secure proximity computation method for it. RESULTS: We have developed a mobile application for the end-user and a web service for the quarantine authorities by applying the proposed method and have verified their effectiveness. Proposed application and web service compute the existence of intersections between the encrypted location history of COVID-19 patients released by the quarantine authorities and the user location history saved on the local device. We also show that the developed contact tracing application can identify whether the user is in contact with patients within a reasonable time on smartphones. CONCLUSIONS: The developed method that shares the location information encrypted with homomorphic encryption is a new method for contact tracing without exposing the location information of the COVID-19 patients and the users. Homomorphic encryption is difficult to apply to practical issues despite its high security value. This study, however, has designed a system applicable to a reasonable size using the BFV scheme, and developed it to an operable format. The developed application and web service can help contact tracing for not only COVID-19, but also other various epidemics.","An, Yongdae; Lee, Seungmyung; Jung, Seungwoo; Park, Howard; Song, Yongsoo; Ko, Taehoon",J. med. internet res,,440

We applied both human monoclonal anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (spike protein, nucleoprotein) and rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (envelope protein, membrane protein) to 55 different tissue antigens. We found that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies had reactions with 28 out of 55 tissue antigens, representing a diversity of tissue groups that included barrier proteins, gastrointestinal, thyroid and neural tissues, and more. We also did selective epitope mapping using BLAST and showed similarities and homology between spike, nucleoprotein, and many other SARS-CoV-2 proteins with the human tissue antigens mitochondria M2, F-actin and TPO. This extensive immune cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and different antigen groups may play a role in the multi-system disease process of COVID-19, influence the severity of the disease, precipitate the onset of autoimmunity in susceptible subgroups, and potentially exacerbate autoimmunity in subjects that have pre-existing autoimmune diseases. Very recently, human monoclonal antibodies were approved for use on patients with COVID-19. The human monoclonal antibodies used in this study are almost identical with these approved antibodies. Thus, our results can establish the potential risk for autoimmunity and multi-system disorders with COVID-19 that may come from cross-reactivity between our own human tissues and this dreaded virus, and thus ensure that the badly-needed vaccines and treatments being developed for it are truly safe to use against this disease.","Vojdani, Aristo; Vojdani, Elroy; Kharrazian, Datis",Front Immunol,,440

In patients with severe symptoms of the disease, pneumonia develops due to Covid-19 virus. This causes intense involvement and damage in lungs. Although the emergence of the disease occurred a short time ago, many literature studies have been carried out in which these effects of the disease on the lungs were revealed by the help of lung CT imaging. In this study, 1.396 lung CT images in total (386 Covid-19 and 1.010 Non-Covid-19) were subjected to automatic classification. In this study, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), one of the deep learning methods, was used which suggested automatic classification of CT images of lungs for early diagnosis of Covid-19 disease. In addition, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to compare the classification successes of deep learning with machine learning. Within the scope of the study, a 23-layer CNN architecture was designed and used as a classifier. Also, training and testing processes were performed for Alexnet and Mobilenetv2 CNN architectures as well. The classification results were also calculated for the case of increasing the number of images used in training for the first 23-layer CNN architecture by 5, 10, and 20 times using data augmentation methods. To reveal the effect of the change in the number of images in the training and test clusters on the results, two different training and testing processes, 2-fold and 10-fold cross-validation, were performed and the results of the study were calculated. As a result, thanks to these detailed calculations performed within the scope of the study, a comprehensive comparison of the success of the texture analysis method, machine learning, and deep learning methods in Covid-19 classification from CT images was made. The highest mean sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F-1 score, and AUC values obtained as a result of the study were 0,9197, 0,9891, 0,9473, 0,9058, 0,9888; respectively for 2-fold cross-validation, and they were 0,9404, 0,9901, 0,9599, 0,9284, 0,9903; respectively for 10-fold cross-validation.","Yasar, Huseyin; Ceylan, Murat",Multimed Tools Appl,,440

One of them is pulmonary artery vasoconstriction and its subsequent pulmonary arterial remodeling. These changes can lead to pulmonary hypertension and the development of right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), right heart failure (RHF) and, ultimately to death. The aim of this review is to describe the most recent molecular pathways involved in the above conditions under this type of hypobaric hypoxia, including oxidative stress, inflammation, protein kinases activation and fibrosis, and the current therapeutic approaches for these conditions. This review also includes the current knowledge of long-term chronic intermittent hypobaric hypoxia. Furthermore, this review highlights the signaling pathways related to oxidative stress (Nox-derived O2.- and H2O2), protein kinase (ERK5, p38&#945; and PKC&#945;) activation, inflammatory molecules (IL-1ß, IL-6, TNF-&#945; and NF-kB) and hypoxia condition (HIF-1&#945;). On the other hand, recent therapeutic approaches have focused on abolishing hypoxia-induced RVH and RHF via attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammatory (IL-1ß, MCP-1, SDF-1 and CXCR-4) pathways through phytotherapy and pharmacological trials.

This case highlights the importance of the prompt recognition of DAH as an initial presentation of MPA and illustrates the possible role of COVID-19 in inciting autoimmune conditions.","Patel, R.; Amrutiya, V.; Baghal, M.; Shah, M.; Lo, A.",Cureus,,440
403573,"Impact of pantoprazole on absorption and disposition of hydroxychloroquine, a drug used in Corona Virus Disease-19 (Covid-19): A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial",2020,"Purpose Physical activity confers many physical and mental health benefits. Thus, it is of great concern that the COVID-19 lockdown has adversely impacted engagement in physical activity. There is a need to understand the factors linked to physical activity during COVID-19 as this will be fundamental to the development of innovative approaches to support engagement in physical activity during a pandemic. This study aimed to ascertain the psychological and mental health predictors of physical activity during the COVID-19 lockdown. We also examined the value of harnessing commercial physical activity apps to facilitate physical activity during a pandemic. Method A nationwide online survey was completed by 408 Australian adults (Mage = 35.7 ± 13.9 years, 86.0% female) following the initial COVID-19 lockdown (April/May 2020). The survey incorporated measures that retrospectively assessed physical activity (and perceived changes in physical activity behaviour), psychological constructs (social support, self-efficacy, self-determined motivations), mental health, and engagement with commercial physical activity apps during the lockdown. Results Over half of participants (53.4%) reported a reduction in physical activity during the initial COVID-19 lockdown, with markedly fewer (23.8%) reporting an increase in physical activity. App use (β = .09, p =.027), social support (β = .10, p =.021), self-efficacy (β = .42, p &lt; 0.001), and identified regulation (β = .25, p &lt; 0.001) emerged as important predictors of physical activity engagement (min/week). Self-efficacy (OR = 4.2, p &lt;.001) was also associated with a greater likelihood of perceived positive changes (increases) in physical activity. The relationship between app use and physical activity was mediated by self-efficacy (β = 0.10 [0.06, 0.15]) and identified regulation (β = 0.09 [0.04, 0.15]);self-efficacy (β = 0.15, [0.09, 0.21]) also mediated the relationship between app use and positive changes in physical activity. Conclusions It is imperative that interventions targeted at increasing social support, self-efficacy, and autonomous motivations are developed and utilised to support engagement in physical activity during a pandemic. Commercial physical activity apps demonstrate the potential to mitigate reductions in physical activity during a pandemic, and thus the use of these apps should be encouraged.","Petersen, Jasmine M.; Kemps, Eva Lewis Lucy K.; Prichard, Ivanka",Psychology of Sport and Exercise,,440

406600,Crucial role of temporary airborne infection isolation rooms in an intensive care unit: containing the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Emergency preparedness is a developing specialty with a limited evidence base. Published literature primarily offers a retrospective view of experience, with few studies examining and understanding the individual lived experience of practitioners prospectively. This study explores paramedics' lived experience of emergency preparedness and applies that learning. METHODS: Thirteen paramedics were recruited through purposive sampling. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews explored their individual experiences of emergency preparedness, in line with the idiographic focus of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. RESULTS: Through data analysis, the following superordinate themes were identified for further discussion: self-determination, control, and experience-based practice. Participants appeared to value their role and the unpredictable environment in which they worked. Personal resilience, an area that they suggested is not covered effectively within individual preparation, was viewed as important. The participants articulated that risk, threat, uncertainty, safety, trust, and control were important concepts within individual preparedness. These paramedics valued practice-based knowledge and education as credible and transferrable to their clinical work. CONCLUSION: Evidence from this study suggests that standard emergency preparedness, with the focus at organizational level, is not sufficient for the individual workers or for an overall effective response. Dimensions of individual preparedness are presented, with the paramedic central to the experience within a conceptual model (the DiEP model), creating a new form of emergency preparedness that reflects the individual paramedic's experience.","Day, Alison; Staniszewska, Sophie; Bullock, Ian",J Emerg Nurs,,440

It not only resulted in a loss of lives, but also in very strict confinement measures. The objective of this study was to understand what the determinants of the changes in participants' behavior and mental state were during the confinement. METHODS: An online survey was launched on 23 April 2020 and closed on 7 May 2020. The final sample included 1454 participants from 24 to 65 years old. Descriptive and multivariate analyses were then performed. RESULTS: In total, 28.7% reported having a more balanced diet, against 17.1% with a less balanced diet, 22.7% of respondents reported an increased alcohol consumption, as opposed to only 12.2% declaring a decrease, and 11.2% of respondents increased their tobacco consumption, while 6.3% decreased it. In total, 50.6% of the participants reported being more depressed, stressed, or irritable since the beginning of the lockdown. Confinement had a negative effect on every behavior studied in this survey, except for nutrition. We also found that negative mental state changes were strongly associated with nutrition, sleep, physical activity and alcohol consumption changes.","Rossinot, Hélène; Fantin, Romain; Venne, Julien",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,440

413208,"Covid-19: Intensive care mortality has fallen by a third since pandemic began, researchers find",2020,"Background Since 23rd January 2020, the Chinese government has imposed restrictive measures including self-isolation, travel restrictions and lockdown of Wuhan city in order to prevent the incoming waves of COVID-19 outbreak in the country. However, the impact of mental health and stress concerns on relationship and sexuality amidst the COVID-19 lockdown was currently unclear. Aim The cross-sectional study was designed to determine the changes in health, relationship and sexuality among the Chinese couples who lived together amid the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods Participants of Chinese nationality aged ≥18 years were asked to complete a self-administered online questionnaire regarding sexuality behaviour and impact of event scale (IES) in March 2020. Non-random sampling was used for participant recruitment. Also assessed were sociodemographic data including sex, age, employment, region, sexual dysfunction, and whether participants tested positive for COVID-19. Outcomes IES score, frequency of sexual intercourse per week, quality of usual sex life, emotional bonding and duration of relationship were measured. Results A total of 1139 participants (i.e., 735 males and 404 females) were included in the study. Mean age and IES of participants was 33.6±9.5 years and 27.4±8.6, respectively. Being male was significantly associated with increased frequency of sexual intercourse amid the COVID-19 pandemic (P=0.012). Also, participants with an IES score &lt;26 were more likely to report that they had increased frequency of sexual intercourse per week (P&lt;0.001) and the COVID-19 pandemic had positively affected the quality of their usual sex lives (P&lt;0.001). On the other hand, participants with IES score ≥26 were more likely to report that the COVID-19 pandemic had positively affected their emotional bonding (P&lt;0.001). Clinical implications Frequency of sexual intercourse and quality of sex life in participants who experienced high stressful impact were more likely to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Strengths and limitations This was one of the first studies to assess sexual behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chinese adults. Since participants were asked to self-report their sexual behaviour, this potentially introduced self-reporting and recall bias into our findings. Conclusions Our study reported that despite the moderate-to-severe stressful impact due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority reported no significant changes in the frequency of their sexual intercourse per week, quality of their usual sexual lives and emotional bonding.","Zhang, Yingfei Wen Conghua Zhang Yutong Luo Xiaoqin Ma Zheng Feei",The Journal of Sexual Medicine,,440

In our unit (Pediatric Pulmonology and Respiratory Intermediate Care Unit, Department of Pediatrics, ""Bambino Gesù"" Children's Hospital and Research Institute), we regularly follow-up CMC patients, particularly children on long-term, invasive (IMV) or noninvasive (NIV), ventilation. Children suffering from chronic diseases and with medical complexity have lost the possibility to go to the hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this article is to describe our experience with telemedicine (teleconsultation [TC] and telemonitoring of ventilator [TM]) in CMC on ventilation. We presented 21 children on long-term ventilation (NIV or IMV) whose planned hospital admission was postponed due to lockdown. A total of 12 healthcare problems were detected during scheduled TCs. Only one problem was not solved by our remote intervention. Specifically, TM has allowed us to change the ventilator parameters and to monitor patients on ventilation remotely. In conclusion, the use of telemedicine in CMC ventilated patients resulted in a feasible tool to avoid in-person visits during the pandemic.","Onofri, Alessandro; Pavone, Martino; De Santis, Simone; Verrillo, Elisabetta; Caggiano, Serena; Ullmann, Nicola; Cutrera, Renato",Pediatr. pulmonol,,440
415521,Novel technique for safe fibreoptic tracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients,2020,"Purpose: Multimorbidity, the simultaneous occurrence of more than 2 diseases, is no longer an exception. Especially non communicable chronic diseases like Osteoarthritis (OA), Diabetes mellitus Type 2 (DMT2), overweight (OW) and obesity (OB) as well as cardio-vascular diseases (CVD) are examples of the most prevalent chronic conditions in industrial nations. The treatment of multimorbidity has not gained much attention in research so far. Especially conservative therapies other than medication have not been established for this specific population. Physical exercise (PE) has been shown to be a treatment option with little adverse events and many positive effects for many single diseases, and physical activity (PA) promotion in general has found its way in many disease management programs. However, a shortfall of research on the effectiveness of specific PE interventions in the treatment of multimorbidity must be stated. The objective of this study therefore was to evaluate a pilot model aiming for behavior change towards the initiation and maintenance of regular PE and its related health benefits in patients with multimorbidity. This abstract focuses on a subsample of participants with knee osteoarthritis. Strength measures of the knee flexors and extensors and self-reported disease related symptoms were analyzed. Methods: Participants with at least two severe risk factors or manifested disease signs for hip and/or knee OA, DMT2, OW/OB, CVD were included in the study. The following analysis relates to the subsample of subjects with or at risk for knee OA. The intervention consisted of two 12-week successive phases. The first phase included different types of supervised aerobic and strength training sessions. Dosage parameters were based on the national PA recommendations. The intervention further comprised theoretical background information on training science, nutrition and behavioral change techniques as well as two personal counselling sessions with the aim to enable participants towards an autonomous exercise participation. The second intervention phase enhanced the self-organized maintenance of the same level of PE. In this phase, participants were contacted via email on a regular base. They received weekly training logs and feedback on their logs as well as another personal counselling session. Data were assessed at baseline (t0), after the first (t3) and after the second intervention phase (t6). Outcomes of this analysis relate to self-reported disease-related symptoms (WOMAC subscale pain and physical functioning) and isometric peak torque measures for knee flexion and extension. The study was conducted in two recruitment waves for organizational reasons. Due to the Covid-19 induced nationwide contact restrictions, strength measures could not be assessed for wave two at t3 in March 2020, therefore only t6 was used for further analysis of strength measures. Wilcoxon Tests were calculated for non-parametric data to assess the changes between t0-t3 and t0-t6. Effect sizes were calculated using r. The study is registered at the German clinical trial register (DRKS00016702). Results: N=39 patients were included in the study, thereof n=23 participants (females=19, males=4) showed disease signs or self-reported risk factors for knee OA. The mean BMI of them was 30.3 ± 3.2 kg/m2 and the mean age was 58.3 ± 6.3 years. Of the subsample, n=22 were also overweight or obese, n=16 had a diagnosis of hypertension, n=2 were diagnosed with DMT2 and n=16 had an elevated risk for DMT2. The WOMAC score was not answered by three participants at t3. One participant did not perform the knee extension test due to pain at t0 and t6. One participant did not perform the isometric torque at t6 due to an elevated blood pressure. 2 participants were lost to follow-up due to family illness (n=1) and shortage of time caused by Covid-19 induced overtime (n=1) and did not provide any data at t6. Median values for WOMAC pain decreased from t0 to t3 but not from t0 to t6, this was not statistically significant. The decrease for the subscale physical function from t0 to t3 and t6 was not statistically significant as well (Table 1). [Formula presented] There was a statistically significant change for isometric peak torque of knee extension. Strength values for knee flexion increased as well, however this was not statistically significant (Table 2, Figure 1). [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Conclusions: Results of this study indicate that a systematic, initially supervised training can lead to objective health benefits in people with knee OA and multimorbidity. Participants of the study showed an increase in maximal isometric force of knee extension with a large effect size. This is an important finding for patients with risk factors as well as already manifested knee OA, as quadriceps strength is known as a protective factor for knee OA and its progression. Results for the WOMAC showed marginal improvement throughout the intervention period. The majority of people only had minor complaints at the beginning of the study, reducing the potential for positive change. One limitation of the study is the onset of the Covid-19 related contact restrictions that prohibited strength measures as well as physical exercise training sessions in gyms and other public places for participants of wave 2 from the 9th intervention week on. The influence of this force majeure on the results of the study cannot be conclusively assessed at this point. Further limitations are related to the small sample size, especially for the subgroup of patients with OA, and the lack of a control group. This was a pilot study for a randomized controlled trial in health services research which is already initiated. Results of this pilot trial therefore indicate the feasibility and the potential benefit of this intervention for multimorbid patients with knee OA that will now be implemented and evaluated in a real health services setting in the near future.","Schweda, S.; Janßen, P.; Sudeck, G.; Burgstahler, C.; Nieß, A.; Krauss, I.",Osteoarthritis and Cartilage,,440
417882,Authors' response,2020,"Serological tests are crucial in a pandemic scenario, since they are a valuable tool to spot those citizens with potential immunity, specific regions with herd immunity or particular at-risk populations, as well as acquired immunity after vaccination. Hence, high-throughput, fast, cost-effective, and straightforward technologies facilitating interrogation of COVID-19 seroconversion are an existing need. Herein, we developed an innovative assay for the determination of COVID-19 seroconversion. Fluorophore-labeled SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain recombinant protein (F-RBD) was discovered to operate as a bioprobe that emits a strong fluorescence upon COVID-19 antibody detection; however, F-RBD fluorescence was deactivated by graphene oxide-decorated surfaces when COVID-19 antibodies are absent in the sample. With a cost of less than 0.5 USD per test (at laboratory scale), the biosensing system offers optimum results within 42 min. To demonstrate that this technology is technically sound in a relevant environment, 34 human serum samples were analyzed and clearly differentiated, requiring a tiny amount of serum (1 µL to be later diluted in saline buffer).","Avila-Huerta, Mariana D; Ortiz-Riaño, Edwin J; Mancera-Zapata, Diana L; Cortés-Sarabia, Karen; Morales-Narváez, Eden",ACS Sens,,440

SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Our objectives are to analysis the expression profile of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human spermatogenic cells, follicle cells, and preimplantation embryos, thereby providing mechanistic insights into viral entry and viral impact on reproduction. We found that ACE2 is mainly expressed during gametogenesis in spermatogonia and oocytes of antral follicles, granulosa cells of antral follicles and pre-ovulatory follicles, while TMPRSS2 almost has no expression in spermatogenic cells, oocytes or granulosa cells. In preimplantation embryos, ACE2 is expressed in early embryos before eight-cell stage, and trophectoderm of late blastocysts, while TMPRSS2 initiates its robust expression in late blastocyst stage. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 only show significant co-expression in trophectoderm of late blastocysts in all above cell types. We speculate that trophectoderm of late blastocysts is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and that the chance of SARS-CoV-2 being passed on to offspring through gametes is very low. Therefore, we propose that fertility preservation for COVID-19 patients is relatively safe and rational. We also recommend embryo cryopreservation and embryo transfer into healthy recipient mother at cleavage stage instead of blastocyst stage. Moreover, we unexpectedly found that co-expression pattern of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in oocytes and preimplantation embryos in human, rhesus monkey and mouse are totally different, so animal models have significant limitations for evaluating transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 in reproduction.","Cheng, Gui-Ping; Guo, Shi-Meng; Zhou, Li-Quan",Mol Reprod Dev,,440
424195,Anesthetist and pandemic: Past and present,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The effects of general anaesthetics on fetal brain development remain elusive. Radial glial progenitors (RGPs) generate the majority of neurons in developing brains. Here, we evaluated the acute alterations in RGPs after maternal sevoflurane exposure. METHODS: Pregnant mice were exposed to 2.5% sevoflurane for 6 hours on gestational day 14.5. Interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) of RGPs in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the fetal brain was evaluated by thymidine analogues labelling. Cell fate of RGP progeny was determined by immunostaining using various neural markers. The Morris water maze (MWM) was used to assess the neurocognitive behaviours of the offspring. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed for the potential mechanism, and the potential mechanism validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), Western blot and rescue experiments. Furthermore, INM was examined in human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived 3D cerebral organoids. RESULTS: Maternal sevoflurane exposure induced temporary abnormities in INM, and disturbed the cell cycle progression of RGPs in both rodents and cerebral organoids without cell fate alternation. RNA-Seq analysis, qPCR and Western blot showed that the Notch signalling pathway was a potential downstream target. Reactivation of Notch by Jag1 and NICD overexpression rescued the defects in INM. Young adult offspring showed no obvious cognitive impairments in MWM. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal sevoflurane exposure during neurogenic period temporarily induced abnormal INM of RGPs by targeting the Notch signalling pathway without inducing long-term effects on RGP progeny cell fate or offspring cognitive behaviours. More importantly, the defects of INM in hESC-derived cerebral organoids provide a novel insight into the effects of general anaesthesia on human brain development.","Jiang, Ming; Tang, Tianxiang; Liang, Xinyue; Li, Juchen; Qiu, Yue; Liu, Shiwen; Bian, Shan; Xie, Yunli; Fang, Fang; Cang, Jing",Cell Prolif,,440

431583,Managing ICU surge during the COVID-19 crisis: rapid guidelines,2020,"Src-family kinases (SFKs), such as c-Src, Lyn and Fyn, belong to non-receptor-type tyrosine kinases and play key roles in cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration. SFKs are anchored to the plasma membrane, Golgi membranes and lysosomal membranes through lipid modifications. Although the functions of SFKs being localized to the plasma membrane are intensively studied, those of SFKs being localized to organelle membranes are poorly understood. Here, we show that, among SFKs, c-Src in particular is involved in a decrease in the amount of LC3-II. c-Src and non-palmitoylated Lyn [Lyn(C3S) (cysteine-3â¯ââ¯serine-3)], which are localized onto lysosomes, decrease the amount of LC3-II and treatment with SFK inhibitors increases the amount of LC3-II, suggesting the importance of SFKs' lysosomal localization for a change of autophagic flux in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Colocalization of LC3-II with the lysosome-associated membrane protein LAMP1 shows that lysosome-localized SFKs promote the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Lysosome-localized SFKs play a positive role in the maintenance of cell viability under starvation conditions, which is further supported by knockdown of c-Src. Therefore, our results suggest that autophagosome-lysosome fusion is promoted by lysosome-localized c-Src, leading to cell survival under starvation conditions.","Suzuki, Ko; Honda, Takuya; Akatsu, Aki; Yamaguchi, Noritaka; Yamaguchi, Naoto",Cell Signal,,440

The diagnosis was made using PCR (gold standard) and/or IgM in serology. It is important to think about this possible aetiology in cases of suggestive demyelinating disease. There is controversy about the role of antibiotics and on whether corticosteroids are contemplated. In conclusion, M. pneumoniae must be a differential diagnosis in acute neuro-ophthalmological disorders in children.","Molero-Senosiain, M; Domingo-Gordo, B; Fernández Cabrera, C; Hernández-García, E; Gómez de Liaño, R",Arch Soc Esp Oftalmol,,440
436165,Optimal delivery management for the prevention of early neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has become a serious global pandemic. This study investigates the clinical characteristics and the risk factors for COVID-19 mortality and establishes a novel scoring system to predict mortality risk in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A cohort of 1,663 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, of whom 212 died and 1,252 recovered, were included in this study. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data on admission were collected from electronic medical records between January 14, 2020 and February 28, 2020. Clinical outcomes were collected until March 26, 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the association between potential risk factors and COVID-19 mortality. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to predict COVID-19 mortality risk. All analyses were conducted in April 2020. RESULTS: Multivariable regression showed that increased odds of COVID-19 mortality was associated with older age (OR=2.15, 95% CI=1.35, 3.43), male sex (OR=1.97, 95% CI=1.29, 2.99), history of diabetes (OR=2.34, 95% CI=1.45, 3.76), lymphopenia (OR=1.59, 95% CI=1.03, 2.46), and increased procalcitonin (OR=3.91, 95% CI=2.22, 6.91, per SD increase) on admission. Spline regression analysis indicated that the correlation between procalcitonin levels and COVID-19 mortality was nonlinear (p=0.0004 for nonlinearity). The area under the receiver operating curve of the COVID-19 mortality risk was 0.765 (95% CI=0.725, 0.805). CONCLUSIONS: The independent risk factors for COVID-19 mortality included older age, male sex, history of diabetes, lymphopenia, and increased procalcitonin, which could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an earlier stage. The COVID-19 mortality risk score model may assist clinicians in reducing COVID-19-related mortality by implementing better strategies for more effective use of limited medical resources.","Yu, Caizheng; Lei, Qing; Li, Wenkai; Wang, Xiong; Liu, Wei; Fan, Xionglin; Li, Wengang",Am J Prev Med,,440

The excess mortality is partly due to the influx of patients requiring hospitalization and intensive care. We propose that the chronology of epidemic spread gives a window of time in which hospitals can act to prevent reaching capacity. METHODS: The out-of-hospital SAMU Emergency Medical System in an entry point into the French health care system. We recorded the number of patients managed, of patients transferred to emergency departments (ED), and of mobile intensive care units (MICUs) dispatched. Each criterion was compared to the mean of the same criterion over the previous 5 years. The alert threshold which indicated a public health crisis was defined as a 20% increase compared to the 5-year mean. RESULTS: The reference period, from January 2015 to December 2019, included 3 381 611 calls, and 1 137 856 patients. The study period, from 17 February to 28 March 2020, included 166 888 calls, and 56 708 patients. The daily numbers of patients managed crossed the threshold on February 25, and increased until the end of the study period. The daily number of patients transferred to ED crossed the threshold on March 16, and increased until the end of the period. The daily number of MICUs dispatched crossed the threshold on March 15, and increased until the end of the period. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 epidemic reached our department in three consecutive waves which overwhelmed the health care system. The first wave preceded by 30 days the massive arrival of critical patients. Health care systems must take advantage of this delay to prepare for the third wave.","Lapostolle, Frédéric; Goix, Laurent; Vianu, Isabelle; Chanzy, Erick; De Stefano, Carla; Gorlicki, Judith; Petrovic, Tomislav; Adnet, Frédéric",Eur J Emerg Med,,440

441674,Salivary and Nasal Detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus After Antiviral Mouthrinses (BBCovid): A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,2020,"Within the healthcare environment, mobile health (mHealth) applications (apps) are more and more important. The number of new mHealth apps has risen steadily in the last years. Especially the Covid-19 pandemic has led to an enormous amount of app releases. Notably, in most countries, mHealth applications have to be already compliant with several regulatory aspects in order to be declared to be a 'medical app'. However, the latest applicable medical device regulation (MDR) does not comment in more detail on the topic of the requirements for mHealth applications. When developing a medical app, it is essential that all contributors in an interdisciplinary team - especially the software engineers - are aware of the specific regulatory requirements beforehand. The development process, however, should not be stalled too long due to the integration of the MDR. Therefore, a developing framework, which includes these aspects, is required, to enable a smooth development process. The paper at hand introduces the creation of such a framework on the basis of the Corona Health and Corona Check apps. The relevant regulatory guidelines are listed and summarized to a guidance for medical app developments. In particular, the important stages and faced challenges emerged during the entire development process are highlighted.","Holfelder, Marc; Mulansky, Lena; Schlee, Winfried; Baumeister, Harald; Schobel, Johannes; Greger, Helmut; Hoff, Andreas; Pryss, Rudiger",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.13635v1.pdf,440

Drug-induced platelet function bleeding disorders are the most frequent PFDs and can easily be identified on the basis of recent administration of platelet-inhibiting drugs. Apart from these, the most challenging acquired PFDs are those caused by autoimmune mechanisms. In fact, demonstration of autoantibodies inhibiting platelet function may be difficult in most non-specialised centres. Among autoimmune PFDs (aPFDs), acquired Glanzmann thrombasthenia (aGT), which is caused by autoantibodies that bind to platelet &#945;IIbß3 integrin, inhibiting its function, is the most frequent. aGT can be associated with underlying haematological malignancies or autoimmune diseases but can also be idiopathic. More rarely, other immunemediated PFDs can occur, such as acquired delta storage pool disease (aÎ´SPD). Treatment of aPFDs must rely on the control of acute and chronic bleedings, treatment of the underlying disease in secondary forms, and immunosuppressive treatment for autoantibody reduction or eradication. aPFDs may completely resolve upon treatment of any underlying disease that may be present. In primary aPFDs, and in the majority of secondary forms, treatment relies on immunosuppressive therapies.Here we present a systematic review of previously described immune-mediated aGT and aÎ´SPD cases. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatments for the control of bleedings and for the eradication of autoantibodies, and responses to treatments are also discussed. Although no guidelines are available for the management of these very rare conditions, presentation of all cases reported so far can help clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of these life-threatening diseases.","Bacci, Monica; Ferretti, Antonietta; Marchetti, Marina; Alberelli, Maria A; Falanga, Anna; Lodigiani, Corrado; De Candia, Erica","Blood transfus.

457364,Emerging pharmacological therapies for ARDS: COVID-19 and beyond,2020,"Multiple rapid antigen (Ag) tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have recently received emergency-use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although less sensitive than molecular detection methods, rapid antigen testing offers the potential for inexpensive, quick, decentralized testing. Robust analytical sensitivity data in comparison to reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) are currently lacking for many rapid antigen tests. Here, we evaluated the analytical sensitivity of the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card using SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical specimens quantified by reverse transcription-droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) and multiple FDA EUA qRT-PCR platforms using RNA standards. Initial and confirmatory limits of detection for the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card were determined to be equivalent to 4.04 × 104 to 8.06 × 104 copies/swab. We further confirmed this limit of detection with 72 additional clinical samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 in either phosphate-buffered saline or viral transport medium. One hundred percent of samples with viral loads of >40,000 copies/swab were detected by rapid antigen testing. These data indicate that the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card has an analytical sensitivity approximately equivalent to a generic qRT-PCR cycle threshold (CT ) value of 29 to 30.","Perchetti, Garrett A; Huang, Meei-Li; Mills, Margaret G; Jerome, Keith R; Greninger, Alexander L",J. clin. microbiol,,440

We retrospectevely reviewed 452 electronic medical records of patients admitted to Internal Medicine Department of a secondary hospital in Madrid during Covid 19 pandemic outbreak. We included 91 patients who underwent a multidetector Computed Tomography pulmonary angiography(CTPA) during conventional hospitalization. The cumulative incidence of PE was assessed ant the clinical, analytical and radiological characteristics were compared between patients with and without PE. PE incidence was 6.4% (29/452 patients). Most patients with a confirmed diagnosed with PE recieved low molecular weight heparin (LMWH): 79.3% (23/29). D-dimer peak was significatly elevated in PE vs non PE patients (14,480 vs 7230 mcg/dL, p = 0.03). In multivariate analysis of patients who underwent a CTPA we found that plasma D-dimer peak was an independen predictor of PE with a best cut off point of > 5000 µg/dl (OR 3.77; IC95% (1.18-12.16), p = 0.03). We found ninefold increased risk of PE patients not suffering from dyslipidemia (OR 9.06; IC95% (1.88-43.60). Predictive value of AUC for ROC is 75.5%.

Rapid, Living Practice Points From the American College of Physicians (Version 1)",2021,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of individuals needing hospital admission has sometimes exceeded the availability of hospital beds. Since hospitalization can have detrimental effects on older individuals, preference has been given to younger patients. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of hospitalization for elderly affected by COVID-19. We hypothesized that their mortality decreases when there is greater access to hospitals. METHODS: This study examined 1902 COVID-19 patients consecutively admitted to three large hospitals in Milan, Italy. Overall mortality data for Milan from the same period was retrieved. Based on emergency department (ED) data, both peak and off-peak phases were identified. The percentage of elderly patients admitted to EDs during these two phases were compared by calculating the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of the individuals younger than, versus older than, 80 years. RESULTS: The median age of the patients hospitalized during the peak phase was lower than the median age during the off-peak phase (64 vs. 75 years, respectively; p <0.001). However, while the SMR for the younger patients was lower during the off-peak phase (1.98, 95% CI: 1.72-2.29 versus 1.40, 95% CI: 1.25-1.58, respectively), the SMR was similar between both phases for the elderly patients (2.28, 95% CI: 2.07-2.52 versus 2.48, 95% CI: 2.32-2.65, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Greater access to hospitals during an off-peak phase did not affect the mortality rate of COVID-19-positive elderly patients in Milan.

466105,Extending the radius of family-centered care in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit through virtual rounding,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 develop the acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring admission to the ICU. This study aimed to describe specific pathophysiological characteristics of acute respiratory distress syndrome from coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Prospective crossover physiologic study. SETTING: ICU of a university-affiliated hospital from northern Italy dedicated to care of patients with confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019. PATIENTS: Ten intubated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: We performed a two-step positive end-expiratory pressure trial with change of 10 cm H2O in random order. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At each positive end-expiratory pressure level, we assessed arterial blood gases, respiratory mechanics, ventilation inhomogeneity, and potential for lung recruitment by electrical impedance tomography. Potential for lung recruitment was assessed by the recently described recruitment to inflation ratio. In a subgroup of seven paralyzed patients, we also measured ventilation-perfusion mismatch at lower positive end-expiratory pressure by electrical impedance tomography. At higher positive end-expiratory pressure, respiratory mechanics did not change significantly: compliance remained relatively high with low driving pressure. Oxygenation and ventilation inhomogeneity improved but arterial CO2 increased despite unchanged respiratory rate and tidal volume. The recruitment to inflation ratio presented median value higher than previously reported in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients but with large variability (median, 0.79 [0.53-1.08]; range, 0.16-1.40). The FIO2 needed to obtain viable oxygenation at lower positive end-expiratory pressure was significantly correlated with the recruitment to inflation ratio (r = 0.603; p = 0.05). The ventilation-perfusion mismatch was elevated (median, 34% [32-45%] of lung units) and, in six out of seven patients, ventilated nonperfused units represented a much larger proportion than perfused nonventilated ones. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome from coronavirus disease 2019, potential for lung recruitment presents large variability, while elevated dead space fraction may be a specific pathophysiological trait. These findings may guide selection of personalized mechanical ventilation settings.","Mauri, Tommaso; Spinelli, Elena; Scotti, Eleonora; Colussi, Giulia; Basile, Maria Cristina; Crotti, Stefania; Tubiolo, Daniela; Tagliabue, Paola; Zanella, Alberto; Grasselli, Giacomo; Pesenti, Antonio",Crit. care med,,440
466106,Extending the radius of family-centered care in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit through virtual rounding,2021,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this review is to explore whether patients with autoimmune diseases (AIDs) were at high risk of infection during the COVID-19 epidemic and how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic affected immune system. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using the foreign databases (NCBI, web of science, EBSCO, ELSEVIER ScienceDirect) and Chinese databases (WanFang, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), VIP, CBM) to locate all relevant publications (up to January 10, 2021). The search strategies used Medical Search Headings (MeSH) headings and keywords for ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"" or ""coronavirus"" and ""autoimmune disease"". RESULTS: This review evaluates the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the immune system through ACE-2 receptor binding as the main pathway for cell attachment and invasion. It is speculated that SARS-COV-2 infection can activate lymphocytes and inflammatory response, which may play a role in the clinical onset of AIDs and also patients were treated with immunomodulatory drugs during COVID-19 outbreak. Preliminary studies suggested that the risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19 in patients with AIDs treated with immunomodulators or biologics might not increase. A large number of samples are needed for further verification, leading to an excessive immune response to external stimuli. CONCLUSION: The relationship between autoimmune diseases and SARS-CoV-2 infection is complex. During the COVID-19 epidemic, individualized interventions for AIDs should be provided such as Internet-based service.","Li, Juan; Liu, Hong-Hui; Yin, Xiao-Dong; Li, Cheng-Cheng; Wang, Jing",Inflamm Res,,440

Therefore, in this study, we investigated the levels of specific-SIgA for SARS-CoV-2 and cytokines in the airways mucosa 37 patients who were suspected of COVID-19. According to the RT-PCR results, the patients were separated into three groups: negative for COVID-19 and other viruses (NEGS, n = 5); negative for COVID-19 but positive for the presence of other viruses (OTHERS, n = 5); and the positive for COVID-19 (COVID-19, n = 27). Higher specific-SIgA for SARS-CoV-2, IFN-ß, and IFN-Î³ were found in the COVID-19 group than in the other groups. Increased IL-12p70 levels were observed in OTHERS group as compared to COVID-19 group. When the COVID-19 group was sub stratified according to the illness severity, significant differences and correlations were found for the same parameters described above comparing severe COVID-19 to the mild COVID-19 group and other non-COVID-19 groups.

472320,Creating Successful Emergency Department and Intensive Care Unit Team Dynamics,2020,"Nonpharmaceutical interventions against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany included the cancellation of mass events (from March 8), closures of schools and child day care facilities (from March 16) as well as a “lockdown” (from March 23). This study attempts to assess the effectiveness of these interventions in terms of revealing their impact on infections over time. Dates of infections were estimated from official German case data by incorporating the incubation period and an empirical reporting delay. Exponential growth models for infections and reproduction numbers were estimated and investigated with respect to change points in the time series. A significant decline of daily and cumulative infections as well as reproduction numbers is found at March 8, March 10 and March 3, respectively. Further declines and stabilizations are found in the end of March. There is also a change point in new infections at April 19, but daily infections still show a negative growth. From March 19, the reproduction numbers fluctuate on a level below one. The decline of infections in early March 2020 can be attributed to relatively small interventions and voluntary behavioural changes. Additional effects of later interventions cannot be detected clearly. Liberalizations of measures from April 20 did not induce a re-increase of infections. Thus, the effectiveness of most German interventions remains questionable. Moreover, assessing of interventions is impeded by the estimation of true infection dates and the influence of test volume.","Wieland, Thomas",Saf. Sci.,,440

477686,High prevalence of acute stress disorder and persisting symptoms in ICU survivors after COVID-19,2021,"Introduction: In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, characterized by a picture of atypical pneumonia composed of fever, dry cough and progressive dyspnea Autopsy analyzes of patients with Covid-19 were performed, and hyperactivation of cytotoxic T cells was observed, suggesting an increase in humoral-type immunological signaling, where interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a mediator present that can fit as a potential critical agent for exacerbation of inflammatory conditions In addition, not only interleukin-6, but also serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin have been recognized as strong predictors of COVID-19 severity Recent studies have shown that the use of liraglutide has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro Thus, the present case report discusses the possible anti-inflammatory properties of the antidiabetic drug liraglutide (Saxenda), in Covid-19 Clinical Case: JCMS, 45 years, male, married, obese grade 2 (BMI: 38 2), sought medical service on August 18, 2020, bringing a positive result of the RT-PCR test for Covid-19, performed in last day The patient was in good general condition, reporting mild headache and adynamia He was prescribed to start a treatment with Saxenda (6mg/ml - started 0 6mg/day at week 1, with a gradual increase up to 3mg/day at week 5);Jardiance (25mg / day);Fluimicil (600mg);Ivermectin (6mg) and Colchicine (0 5mg every 12 hours) In addition, collection of laboratory tests was requested Examination results: IL6: &amp;lt;1 5 pg/mL;Ferritin: 819 ng/ml;C-reactive protein: 5 1mg/L On August 24, the patient was tachycardic (HR 120–140 bpm) associated with headache and fever (38 °C) Azithromycin (500mg), dexamethasone (4mg) and dipyrone (1g) were prescribed Collection of laboratory tests was requested Examination results: IL6: 9 3 pg/mL;Ferritin: 1085 ng/ml;C-reactive protein:23 9mg/L On September 3, the patient was in good general condition, eupneic, afebrile, with no complaints to declare On September 6, the collection of laboratory tests was requested Examination results: IL6: &amp;lt;1 5 pg/mL;Ferritin: 687 ng/ml;C-reactive protein: 1 7mg/L Conclusion: Based on the described report, it is possible to observe a good clinical and laboratory evolution of the patient with Covid-19 who, among the drugs used, made use of liraglutida Diabetes and obesity are considered significant risk factors for morbidity and mortality by COVID-19, since they are a condition of low-grade chronic inflammation and in these conditions, inflammatory markers such as CRP, IL-6 and ferritin have strong signs of alteration Thus, the possible beneficial effect of the administration of liraglutide in obese patients is highlighted, as a potential anti-inflammatory effect, especially in the COVID-19 era","Hanada, Taliê Zanchetta Buani Knack Rafael Silvestre Knack Renata Silvestre",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,440
479116,Nursing Home Staffing Levels Did Not Change Significantly During COVID-19,2021,"Background: The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) made imperative the use of protective devices as a source control tool. As there is no definite antiviral treatment and effective vaccine, the only efficient means of protecting and mitigating infectious contagion has been the use of personal protective equipment, especially by healthcare workers. However, masks affect the humidification process of inhaled air, possibly leading to a basal inflammatory state of the upper airways. Study design: This is a single-center observational study conducted at the University Hospital of Catania from April 1, 2020, to June 31, 2020. Methods: We analyzed the role of protective masks on the elimination of upper airways complaints in healthcare workers of the University Hospital of Catania. We evaluated 277 subjects through a selfadministered 17 item questionnaire based on respiratory, work performance and health-related quality of life domains. Results: A higher prevalence of nasal and ocular symptoms, perceived reduced work performance, difficulty in concentrating, and sleep disorders were found. After two weeks adhering to a list of good practices that we recommended, significant reversibility of the symptoms investigated and work performance enhancement were observed. Conclusions: Despite clinical complaints related to personal protective equipment, effective amelioration through usage rules is easily obtained. Given the essential use of protective masks, healthcare workers have to adhere to appropriate work and safety prevention rules.","Maniaci, A; Ferlito, S; Bubbico, L; Ledda, C; Rapisarda, V; Iannella, G; La Mantia, I; Grillo, C; Vicini, C; Privitera, E; Coco, S; Cammaroto, G; Lechien, J R; Magliulo, G; Pace, A; Meccariello, G; Cocuzza, S",Ann. ig,,440

The causative agent, SARS-CoV-2 was the third coronavirus responsible for causing major disease outbreaks in human population after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively. The patients of COVID-19 present with a clinical feature resembling mild form of viral pneumonia which in certain cases progress to a severe form characterised by adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or multiorgan failure leading to death. The transition from mild to severe form of COVID-19 is affected by a lot of factors like age, co-morbidities etc. In the absence of an absolute cure, it is essential to explore the molecular pathogenesis of the disease to identify people at risk of developing severity so that alternative treatment modalities may be planned. The aim of this review is to provide an update on the general characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and highlight the inflammatory changes and immune dysregulation that may help in identification of molecular predictors of disease severity.","Lingeswaran, Malavika; Goyal, Taru; Ghosh, Raghumoy; Suri, Smriti; Mitra, Prasenjit; Misra, Sanjeev; Sharma, Praveen",Indian J.

481175,"Correction to: COVID-19 in critical care: epidemiology of the first epidemic wave across England, Wales and Northern Ireland",2021,"Background and Objective The novel Coronavirus pandemic surfaced in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread rapidly across the globe. In recent available literature, most of the studies were done to estimate the burden of psychiatric problems among general population due to this pandemic, Therefore, this study was planned to assess depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance among Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients. Materials and Methods A hospital-based, cross-sectional study was done from June 2020 to August 2020 among 100 COVID-19 patients who were admitted and fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Assessment of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance were done by patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale, generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale and Pittsburg sleep quality index (PSQI), respectively. Results In this study, 73% were males and 27% were females. The mean age of the patients in present study was 42.90 ± 16.33 years. This study reveals that depression was in 27%, anxiety in 67%, and sleep disturbance in 62% of patients. Depression and anxiety were found significantly associated with presence of comorbidity and severity of illness (p &lt; 0 0.05). The association of sleep disturbance with severity of illness was also found statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion The risk of psychological stress is high in COVID-19 patients. The psychological problems among COVID-19 patients are commonly related to the consequences of disease, and severity and contagiousness of the disease. Therefore, in this present pandemic situation, it is more important to identify these psychological problems among COVID-19 patients, so that better care and timely interventions can be done with respect to psychological issues.

Method: an experience report on the creation and management of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) unit, in March 2020, in 2020, in a philanthropic hospital of the state of Santa Catarina. Results: the unit was structured with 10 intensive care beds and 20 infirmary beds. Meetings were held to make decisions, as well as to create protocols and flows with active participation of the nurse. In questions related to direct assistance, adaptations were developed in the nursing process performed at the hospital and the organization of new flows and routines. The physical space was structured, considering the high risk of transmissibility for the disease. Professionals were hired with staffing readjustment according to the complexity of the service, making up a team of professionals with experience in critical care. There were trainings for developing knowledge and skills prior to the first cases, which were systematically maintained. In addition, it was observed that the nurses were concerned about the mental health of the professionals working in this unit and, therefore, support actions were programmed. Conclusion: the foundation in the scientific evidence and recommendations of the competent bodies at the world and national levels for the structuring of the COVID-19 unit is emphasized. The role of the nurse in all the interfaces stands out, assuming a fundamental role from the composition of the commissions, going through the planning and functioning of the physical structure, management of human resources, and construction of care protocols and flows, in addition to acting directly in the care provided.","Bitencourt, Julia Valeria de Oliveira Vargas; Meschial, William Campo; Frizon, Gloriana; Biffi, Priscila; Souza, Jeane Barros de; Maestri, Eleine",Texto &amp; contexto enferm,,440

The NZWR has dual ophthalmic arteries (OA): the external OA (EOA) arises from the external carotid artery and the internal OA (IOA) from the internal carotid artery. We describe the technique that we have refined for OA catheterization in rabbits, and describe the angioanatomical variations in the OA supply to the NZWR eye and implications for IAC delivery, which were identified as part of a larger project exploring IAC effects in a rabbit retinoblastoma model. METHODS: We developed techniques to perform angiography of the external and internal carotid arteries and superselective angiography of the EOA and IOA in NZWR using transfemoral access and a microwire/microcatheter system. EOA and IOA supply to the eye was determined angiographically and recorded before selective OA catheterization and angiography. RESULTS: 114 rabbits underwent carotid angiographic evaluation and OA catheterization (161 total eyes evaluated, 112 right, 49 left). Most eyes had a single dominant arterial supply; either IOA or EOA. EOA was dominant in 73% (118/161), and IOA was dominant in 17% (27/161). Co-dominant supply was seen in 10% (16/161). Of the rabbits with bilateral OA catheterization, 25/47 (53%) had bilateral dominant EOA. CONCLUSION: Successful catheterization of the OA in the NZWR can be readily accomplished with nuanced technique. The external OA is the dominant arterial supply in the majority of NZWR eyes. These findings allow for successful reproduction of OA catheterization studies of IAC for retinoblastoma in NZWR.","Froehler, Michael T; Feldman, Michael J; Poitras, Bryan; Daniels, Anthony B",J. neurointerv. surg.

488397,Neuroanatomical substrates of generalized brain dysfunction in COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: ""Re-infection"" with COVID-19 is a growing concern; re-infection cases have reported worldwide. However, the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 re-infection, including the levels and role of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein IgG antibodies and the half-maximal concentration (IC50) of neutralizing antibodies remain unknown. METHODS: Both the epidemiological and clinical information has been collected during two episodes of COVID-19 in a patient. Laboratory results, including RT-PCR, Ct values, anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein IgG antibodies, and the IC50 of neutralizing antibodies levels were analyzed on the patient. RESULTS: The patient was a 58-year-old man who developed moderate COVID-19 pneumonia with oxygen demand (cannula 2 L/min) in the first episode. By day 30, he recuperated and was discharged after testing negative for SARS-CoV-2. After two and a half months, his three family members showed COVID-19 symptoms and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 once again and was asymptomatic (the second episode). The IC50 of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 greatly increased from 50.0 µg/mL (after the first episode) to 14.8 µg/mL (after the second episode), and remained strongly reactive (20.1 µl/mL) after 47 days of the second episode. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological, clinical, and serological analyses confirmed that the patient had re-infection instead of persistent viral shedding from first infection. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 re-infection may manifest as asymptomatic with increased neutralizing antibody levels. Further studies such as the virus characteristics, immunology, and epidemiology on SARS-CoV-2 re-infection are needed.","Inada, Makoto; Ishikane, Masahiro; Terada, Mari; Matsunaga, Akihiro; Maeda, Kenji; Tsuchiya, Kiyoto; Miura, Kenji; Sairenji, Yu; Kinoshita, Noriko; Ujiie, Mugen; Kutsuna, Satoshi; Ishizaka, Yukihito; Mitsuya, Hiroaki; Ohmagari, Norio",J. infect. chemother,,440

497345,R0 and re of covid-19: Can we predict when the pandemic outbreak will be contained?,2020,"ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease caused by SARS-Cov-2 is a pandemic with millions of confirmed cases around the world and a high death toll Currently, the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the standard diagnostic method for determining COVID-19 infection Various failures in the detection of the disease by means of laboratory samples have raised certain doubts about the characterization of the infection and the spread of contacts In clinical practice, chest radiography (RT) and chest computed tomography (CT) are extremely helpful and have been widely used in the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 RT is the most common and widely available diagnostic imaging technique, however, its reading by less qualified personnel, in many cases with work overload, causes a high number of errors to be committed Chest CT can be used for triage, diagnosis, assessment of severity, progression, and response to treatment Currently, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have shown promise in image classification, showing that they can reduce diagnostic errors by at least matching the diagnostic performance of radiologists This review shows how AI applied to thoracic radiology speeds up and improves diagnosis, allowing to optimize the workflow of radiologists It can provide an objective evaluation and achieve a reduction in subjectivity and variability AI can also help to optimize the resources and increase the efficiency in the management of COVID-19 infection RESUMEN La enfermedad causada por el coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 es una pandemia con millones de casos confirmados en todo el mundo y un alto número de fallecimientos Actualmente, la reacción en cadena de la polimerasa en tiempo real (RT-PCR) es el método de diagnóstico estándar para determinar la infección por COVID-19 Diversos fracasos en la detección de la enfermedad por medio de muestras de laboratorio han planteado ciertas dudas sobre la caracterización de la infección y la propagación a los contactos En la práctica clínica, la radiografía de tórax (RT) y la tomografía computarizada de tórax (TC) son extremadamente útiles y se han utilizado extensamente en la detección y diagnóstico de la COVID-19 La RT es la técnica de diagnóstico por imagen más común y la que está más ampliamente disponible, sin embargo, su lectura por personal menos cualificado, en muchos casos con sobrecarga de trabajo, hace que se cometa un gran número de errores La tomografía computarizada del tórax se puede utilizar para el triaje, el diagnóstico, la evaluación de la gravedad, la progresión y la respuesta al tratamiento Actualmente, los algoritmos de inteligencia artificial (IA) han resultado prometedores en la clasificación de imágenes, mostrando que pueden reducir los errores de diagnóstico, como mínimo igualando el rendimiento diagnóstico de los radiólogos Esta revisión muestra cómo la IA aplicada a la radiología torácica acelera y mejora el diagnóstico, lo que permite optimizar el flujo de trabajo de los radiólogos Puede proporcionar una evaluación objetiva y lograr una reducción de la subjetividad y la variabilidad La IA también puede ayudar a optimizar los recursos y aumentar la eficiencia en la gestión de la infección por COVID-19","Abelaira, María Dolores Corbacho Abelaira Fernando Corbacho Ruano-Ravina Alberto Fernández-Villar Alberto",Open Respiratory Archives,,440
502189,Not only intensive care unit workload and activities but also quality indicators are influenced by the COVID-19 epidemic,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Many patients with haemoglobinopathies, including thalassaemia and sickle cell disease, are at increased risk of developing severe complications from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although epidemiologic evidence concerning the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection in these patients is currently lacking, the COVID-19 pandemic represents a significant challenge for haemoglobinopathy patients, their families and their attending physicians. METHODS: The present statement summarizes the key challenges concerning the management of haemoglobinopathies, with particular focus on patients with either transfusion-dependent or non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia, identifies the gaps in knowledge and suggests measures and strategies to deal with the pandemic, based on available evidence and expert opinions. Key areas covered include patients' risk level, adaptation of haemoglobinopathy care, safety of blood transfusions, blood supply challenges, and lifestyle and nutritional considerations. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed measures and strategies may be useful as a blueprint for other disorders which require regular hospital visits, as well as for the timely adaptation of patient care during similar future pandemics.","Farmakis, Dimitrios; Giakoumis, Anastasios; Cannon, Lily; Angastiniotis, Michael; Eleftheriou, Androulla",Eur. j. haematol,,440
506790,COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Algerian medical students: a cross-sectional study in five universities,2021,"Introduction: The extreme health and economic problems in the world due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection have led to an urgent need to identify potential drug targets for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The present state-of-the-art tool-based screening was targeted to identify drug targets among clinically approved drugs by uncovering SARS-CoV-2 helicase inhibitors through molecular docking analysis. Material and methods: Helicase is a vital viral replication enzyme, which unwinds nucleic acids and separates the double-stranded nucleic acids into single-stranded nucleic acids. Hence, the SARS-CoV-2 helicase protein 3D structure was predicted, validated, and used to screen the druggable targets among clinically approved drugs such as protease inhibitor, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, used to treat HIV infection using molecular docking analysis. Results: Interaction with SARS-CoV-2 helicase, approved drugs, vapreotide (affinity: -12.88; S score: -9.84 kcal/mol), and atazanavir (affinity: -11.28; S score: -9.32 kcal/mol), approved drugs for treating AIDS-related diarrhoea and HIV infection, respectively, are observed with significantly low binding affinity and MOE score or binding free energy. The functional binding pockets of the clinically approved drugs on SARS-CoV-2 helicase protein molecule suggest that vapreotide and atazanavir may interrupt the activities of the SARS-CoV-2 helicase. Conclusions: The study suggests that vapreotide may be a choice of drug for wet lab studies to inhibit the infection of SARS-CoV-2.","Francis Borgio, J.; Alsuwat, Hind Saleh; Al Otaibi, Waad Mohammed; Ibrahim, Abdallah M.; Almandil, Noor B.; Al Asoom, Lubna Ibrahim; Salahuddin, Mohammed; Kamaraj, Balu; AbdulAzeez, Sayed",Arch.

507359,What's happening in covid-19 ICUs? An intensive care doctor answers some common questions,2020,"Background: The absence of specific antivirals to treat COVID-19 leads to the repositioning of candidates' drugs. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) has a broad antiviral effect. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind pilot clinical trial comparing NTZ 600 mg BID versus Placebo for seven days among 50 individuals (25 each arm) with SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR+ (PCR) that were hospitalized with mild respiratory insufficiency from May 20th, 2020, to September 21st, 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04348409). Clinical and virologic endpoints and inflammatory biomarkers were evaluated. A five-point scale for disease severity (SSD) was used. Findings: Two patients died in the NTZ arm compared to 6 in the placebo arm (p = 0.564). NTZ was superior to placebo when considering SSD (p < 0001), the mean time for hospital discharge (6.6 vs. 14 days, p = 0.021), and negative PCR at day 21 (p = 0.035), whereas the placebo group presented more adverse events (p = 0.04). Among adverse events likely related to the study drug, 14 were detected in the NTZ group and 22 in placebo (p = 0.24). Among the 30 adverse events unlikely related, 21 occurred in the placebo group (p = 0.04). A decrease from baseline was higher in the NTZ group for d-Dimer (p = 0.001), US-RCP (p < 0.002), TNF (p < 0.038), IL-6 (p < 0.001), IL-8 (p = 0.014), HLA DR. on CD4+ T lymphocytes (p < 0.05), CD38 in CD4+ and CD8+ T (both p < 0.05), and CD38 and HLA-DR. on CD4+ (p < 0.01). Interpretation: Compared to placebo in clinical and virologic outcomes and improvement of inflammatory outcomes, the superiority of NTZ warrants further investigation of this drug for moderate COVID-19 in larger clinical trials. A higher incidence of adverse events in the placebo arm might be attributed to COVID-19 related symptoms.","Blum, Vinicius Fontanesi; Cimerman, Sérgio; Hunter, James R; Tierno, Paulo; Lacerda, Acioly; Soeiro, Alexandre; Cardoso, Florentino; Bellei, Nancy Cristina; Maricato, Juliana; Mantovani, Nathalia; Vassao, Marcella; Dias, Danilo; Galinskas, Juliana; Janini, Luis Mário Ramos; Santos-Oliveira, Joanna Reis; Da-Cruz, Alda Maria; Diaz, Ricardo Sobhie",EClinicalMedicine,,440

The purpose of this study was to assess the impacts of the lockdown measures on air quality and pollutant emissions in Valencia, Spain. For this reason, we determined if there was a significant difference in the concentration levels of different particulate matter (PM) sizes, PM10, PM2.5, and NOx, NO2, NO, and O3, between the period of restrictions in 2020 and the same period in 2019. Our findings indicated that PM pollutant levels during the lockdown period were significantly different from the same period of the previous year, even if there is variability in the different local areas. The highest variations reduction in the PM10 and PM2.5 levels were observed for the València Centre, València Avd Francia, and València Pista de Silla (all of the urban traffic type) in which there was a reduction of 58%-42%, 56%-53%, and 60%-41% respectively. Moreover, consistent with recent studies, we observed a significant reduction in nitric oxide levels in all the air monitoring stations. In all seven monitoring stations, it was observed, in 2020, NOx, NO2, and NO concentrations decreased by 48.5%-49.8%-46.2%, 62.1%-67.4%-45.7%, 37.4%-35.7%-35.3%, 60.7%-67.7%-47.1%, 65.5%-65.8%-63.5%, 60.0%-64.5%-41.3%, and 60.4%-61.6%-52.5%, respectively. Lastly, overall O3 levels decreased during the lockdown period, although this phenomenon was more closely related to weather conditions. Overall, no significant differences were observed between the meteorological conditions in 2019 and 2020. Our findings suggest that further studies on the effect of human activities on air quality are needed and encourage the adoption of a holistic approach to improve urban air quality.","Donzelli, Gabriele; Cioni, Lorenzo; Cancellieri, Mariagrazia; Llopis-Morales, Agustin; Morales-Suárez-Varela, María",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,440

509498,Educational adaptation for the COVID-19 pandemic: A virtual model enables ongoing training,2021,"BACKGROUND: People with MS (pwMS) have had higher rates of anxiety and depression than the general population before the COVID-19 pandemic, placing them at higher risk of experiencing poor psychological wellbeing during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To assess mental health and its social/lifestyle determinants in pwMS during the first wave of the outbreak in the United Kingdom. METHODS: This is a community-based, prospective longitudinal cohort and cross-sectional case-control online questionnaire study. It includes 2010 pwMS from the UK MS Register and 380 people without MS. RESULTS: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores of pwMS for anxiety and depression during the outbreak did not change from the previous year. PwMS were more likely to have anxiety (using General Anxiety Disorder-7) and/or depression (using Patient Health Questionnaire-9) than controls during the outbreak (OR: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.58-2.91). PwMS felt lonelier (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.04-1.80) reported worse social support (OR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.18-3.07) and reported worsened exercise habits (OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.18-2.32) during the outbreak than controls. CONCLUSION: Early in the pandemic, pwMS remained at higher risk of experiencing anxiety and depression than the general population. It is important that multidisciplinary teams improve their support for the wellbeing of pwMS, who are vulnerable to the negative effects of the pandemic on their lifestyle and social support.","Garjani, Afagh; Hunter, Rachael; Law, Graham R; Middleton, Rodden M; Tuite-Dalton, Katherine A; Dobson, Ruth; Ford, David V; Hughes, Stella; Pearson, Owen R; Rog, David; Tallantyre, Emma C; Nicholas, Richard; Morriss, Richard; Evangelou, Nikos; das Nair, Roshan",Mult Scler,,440

514345,Author's response,2020,"We study a stochastic behavior of aerosols by the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics approach using the analytical approach of the Langevin equation. We firstly show that superdiffusion can possibly occur right after the emission, which may be attributed to the physical mechanism of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also provide clear evidence of the least required distance to prevent infections occurred by aerosols. In particular, the required distance to prevent aerosol infections is derived to be about 42 m when we assume Cauchy distribution as an initial velocity distribution. This fact implies that due to superdiffusion the aerosol infection can occur even far away from a long distance as compared to the previous considerations.","Sugimoto, Satoshi; Umeno, Ken",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.16821v7.pdf,440
514347,Author's response,2020,"On May 8, 2020, the Vermont Department of Health (VDH) issued a Health Update* recommending shortening the duration of quarantine for persons exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Exposed persons who were in quarantine could be tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on or after quarantine day 7. Those who had remained asymptomatic throughout quarantine and who received a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result on or after day 7 could end quarantine. This policy was based on a report suggesting that symptom onset occurs within this time frame in approximately three quarters of COVID-19 cases (1) and on consultation of the Vermont Health Commissioner with the U.S. Surgeon General. VDH implemented this policy to minimize restrictions on state residents, recognizing that some reduction could occur in the prevention benefit of quarantine to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. State-run SARS-CoV-2 testing sites were made available to increase access to no-cost testing and facilitate implementation of this policy. During August 1-December 1, among persons seeking testing at a VDH SARS-CoV-2 testing site, 36% stated that their reason for seeking testing was to end quarantine early (VDH, unpublished data, December 7, 2020), indicating that persons were aware of and following the policy and using the testing services provided. To assess the effectiveness of this policy, VDH analyzed testing data for contacts of persons with a COVID-19 diagnosis. During May 8-November 16, VDH identified 8,798 exposed contacts of COVID-19 patients; 3,983 (45%) had sought testing within 14 days of their exposure, with day 0 defined as the date of last exposure noted in the case investigation record. Among these persons, 2,200 (55%) who received testing on days 7-10 were included in this analysis; 977 (44.9%) of these contacts had a specimen collected for testing on day 7. Among these, 34 (3%) had test results that were positive, 940 (96%) had results that were negative, and three (<1%) had results that were indeterminate (Table). Among the 34 contacts who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result on day 7 after exposure, 12 (35%) were asymptomatic. The remaining 22 contacts with positive test results were symptomatic at the time of testing; approximately one half had developed symptoms on days 4-7 after exposure. Among the 940 contacts who received negative test results on specimens collected on day 7 after exposure, 154 (16%) had a subsequent test within the next 7 days (i.e., days 8-14); among these, 152 (99%) had tests that remained negative, and two (1%) had results that were indeterminate.","Jones, Amanda; Fialkowski, Veronica; Prinzing, Lauren; Trites, Jeffrey; Kelso, Patsy; Levine, Mark",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,440

The main objective of this study was to report the real-time effective reproduction numbers (R(t)) and case fatality rates (CFR) in Europe. METHODS: Data for this study were obtained mainly from the World Health Organization website, up to March 9, 2020. R(t) were estimated by exponential growth rate (EG) and time-dependent (TD) methods. 'R0' package in R was employed to estimate R(t) by fitting the existing epidemic curve. Both the naïve CFR (nCFR) and adjusted CFR (aCFR) were estimated. RESULTS: With the EG method, R(t) was 3.27 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.17-3.38) for Italy, 6.32 (95% CI 5.72-6.99) for France, 6.07 (95% CI 5.51-6.69) for Germany, and 5.08 (95% CI 4.51-5.74) for Spain. With the TD method, the R value for March 9 was 3.10 (95% CI 2.21-4.11) for Italy, 6.56 (95% CI 2.04-12.26) for France, 4.43 (95% CI 1.83-7.92) for Germany, and 3.95 (95% CI 0-10.19) for Spain. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides important findings on the early outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe. Due to the recent rapid increase in new cases of COVID-19, real-time monitoring of the transmissibility and mortality in Spain and France is a priority.","Yuan, Jing; Li, Minghui; Lv, Gang; Lu, Z Kevin",Int J Infect Dis,,440

So far, the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the assay of choice for COVID-19 diagnosis considering its rapidity and accuracy in informing on active coronavirus (CoV) infection. Presently, several RT-qPCR protocols with differing sensitivity/specificity are used for performing this assay; some of them are known to have generated debatable test results to constitute challenges worthy of consideration. This review provides a critical assessment of various published works on RT-qPCR assays used for COVID-19 diagnosis with their different indicators of positivity i.e., cycle threshold (Ct) cut-off values. Knowledge of diagnostic tests for COVID-19 is still evolving and, as a prospect, underscores the need for local validation of positive-negative Ct cut-off values when establishing RT-qPCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection.","Sule, Waidi Folorunso; Oluwayelu, Daniel Oladimeji",Pan Afr Med J,https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.supp.2020.35.24258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33282076/,440

It is increasingly evident that many CV conditions occur frequently. These include myopericarditis, acute coronary syndromes, thrombosis, arrhythmias, hypertension and heart failure. Many professional organisations and societies related to cardiology have produced guidelines or recommendations on most of the above-mentioned aspects. Given these rapid developments, the aims of this review manuscript were to summarise and integrate recent publications with newly developed guidelines and with the first-hand experience of frontline physicians and to yield a pragmatic insight and approach to CV complications of COVID-19. We emphasise on a strategic tier-based approach for initial assessment and management of COVID-19, and then delve into focused areas within CV domains, and additionally highlighting the role of point-of-care ultrasound especially lung ultrasound, echocardiography and electrocardiography, in the management of these patients.

The median GQS was 3 and total DISCERN score was 49. According to the GQS, 21.6% of the videos were of low quality, 35.3% were of fair quality, and 43.1% were of high quality. High-quality videos had higher DISCERN scores and longer duration of videos (p < 0.05). 41 (80.4%) videos were categorized as useful information, and 8 (15.7%) as useful as per patients’ opinion. Further, GQS and DISCERN scores of videos that had useful information were significantly higher. There are numerous YouTube videos with helpful information that can be a source of knowledge on the safe and correct technique of daily anakinra self-injection for both adults and children. There was no significant difference in patient interaction between useful and misleading videos. This indicates that patients do not differentiate between high- and low-quality videos.

Reliable exposure assessment was investigated to understand the exposure pattern of biocidal products used by occupational workers in their place of occupation, multi-use facilities, and general facilities. The interview–survey approach was taken to obtain the database about several subcategories of twelve occupational groups, the use pattern, and the exposure information of non-human hygiene disinfectant and insecticide products in workplaces. Furthermore, we investigated valuable exposure factors, e.g., the patterns of use, exposure routes, and quantifying potential hazardous chemical intake, on biocidal active ingredients. We focused on biocidal active-ingredient exposure from products used by twelve occupational worker groups. The 685 non-human hygiene disinfectants and 763 insecticides identified contained 152 and 97 different active-ingredient chemicals, respectively. The toxicity values and clinical health effects of total twelve ingredient chemicals were determined through a brief overview of toxicity studies aimed at estimating human health risks. To estimate actual exposure amounts divided by twelve occupational groups, the time spent to apply the products was investigated from the beginning to end of the product use. This study investigated the exposure assessment of occupational exposure to biocidal products used in workplaces, multi-use facilities, and general facilities. Furthermore, this study provides valuable information on occupational exposure that may be useful to conduct accurate exposure assessment and to manage products used for quarantine in general facilities.","Kim, Joo-Hyon; Hwang, Moon-Young; Kim, Yoo-jin",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17238770; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33255824/,440
603823,Giving Voice: Nurse-Patient Communication in the Intensive Care Unit.,2021-07-01,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders in clinical practice. IBS diagnosis is based on symptoms defined by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with defecation or changes in bowel habits. Gut-brain interaction caused by stress or depressive emotion is one of the essential pathologies. Acupuncture has been used for the treatment of internal medicine, including digestive disorders and depressive disorders in Chinese medicine. This study aims to determine whether electro-acupuncture could have significant benefits than sham acupuncture for IBS. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a single-blinded randomized sham-controlled clinical trial with two arms. A total of 120 IBS patients will be recruited. After a 2-week run-in period, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two arms, acupuncture (AC) arm and sham acupuncture (SAC) arm. Each eligible subject will go through a 2-week run-in-period, 6-week treatment period, and 6-week follow-up period. Five visits in total were scheduled for each subject in week 0, week 2, week 5, week 8, and week 14. The outcomes would be measured with (1) IBS-SSS, (2) Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), (3) Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), (4) Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and (5) IBS Quality of Life (IBS-QoL). DISCUSSION: The study will compare electro-acupuncture with sham acupuncture to explore the feasibility of electro-acupuncture in improving IBS symptoms.

Several factors, including higher stress due to social isolation, diminished melatonin levels with age, and higher exposure of individuals to light at the evening, which reduces melatonin levels and disrupts circadian rhythmicity are relevant for maintaining the circadian health in aged individuals. Properly administered, chronotherapy restores the optimal circadian pattern of the sleep–wake cycle in the elderly. It involves adequate sleep hygiene, timed light exposure, and the use of a chronobiotic medication like melatonin, which affects the output phase of circadian rhythms thus controlling the biological clock. Besides, the therapeutic potential of melatonin as an agent to counteract the consequences of COVID-19 infections has been advocated due to its wide-ranging effects as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and as an immunomodulatory agent, as well as to a possible antiviral action. This article discusses how chronotherapy may reverse the detrimental circadian condition of the elderly in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cardinali, Daniel P.; Brown, Gregory M.; Reiter, Russel J.; Pandi-Perumal, Seithikurippu R.",Sleep Vigil,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41782-020-00111-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33015537/,440

Clinical records, demography, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography scans were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between the 2 groups. Results No adverse events were observed, except for an increased frequency of chills in the BCG-vaccinated group versus the unvaccinated group (p=0.014). There were no significant differences in oxygen demand for breathing, computed tomography scans, treatments, or outcomes between the 2 groups. However, BCG vaccination was associated with significantly less severe pneumonia (p=0.028) and milder deficiency in liver function, consistent with a lower death rate in comparison with the unvaccinated group. Conclusions BCG vaccination received in childhood is associated with less severe COVID-19 pneumonia and milder liver function deficiency in addition to a lower death rate in BCG-vaccinated patients versus non-vaccinated individuals.","Chen, Fan; Chen, GuoXi; Zhou, Jing; Xue, Yun; Wu, Mei X.",Am J Prev Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379721001987?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0749379721001987; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2021.02.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33985834/,440

Its nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11), with the nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) domain, is essential for PRRSV genome replication and it also contributes to host innate immunity suppression. However, the immunogenicity and immune structure of PRRSV nsp11 have not been well investigated yet. In this study, a monoclonal antibody (mAb), designated 3F9, that against nsp11 was generated. Subsequently, a series of partially overlapped fragments, covered the nsp11(40-223aa), were expressed to test the reactivity with mAb 3F9, and the (111)DCREY(115) was found to be the core unit of the B-cell epitope recognized by mAb 3F9. Further investigation indicated that both genotype 1 and genotype 2 PRRSV can be recognized by mAb 3F9, due to the (111)DCREY(115) is conserved in both genotype virus. Meanwhile, this epitope, localized at the surface of nsp11 in 3D structure, is confirmed to be able to induce humoral immune response in PRRSV infected pigs.

In this report, we aim to further characterize the changes in cardiac catheterization at our institution, specifically in the setting of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization between December 23, 2019 and April 12, 2020 at our institution. All patients with cardiac catheterizations for ACS, ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) activation, and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) were analyzed. Cardiac catheterization volume, as well as clinical and procedural characteristics of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, was compared before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Patients presenting with ACS and OHCA were similar in terms of demographics and comorbidities during both time periods. The mean monthly volume for ACS cases dropped by 26% during the pandemic, which was consistent among both unstable angina/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) and STEMI cases. OHCA volume decreased significantly as well (five cases per month before to zero cases during the pandemic, P = 0.01). Among patients with STEMI, initial markers of cardiac injury, door-to-balloon time, and all-cause mortality were similar in both time periods. CONCLUSIONS: With the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a reduction in cardiac catheterization volume across the spectrum of ACS at our institution, which was consistent with reports from other centers across the globe. Patients with STEMI during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic did not seem to have delays in presentation or significant differences in all-cause mortality at our institution.","Tan, Weiyi; Parikh, Rushi V.; Chester, Rebecca; Harrell, Jeffrey; Franco, Vanessa; Aksoy, Olcay; Dave, Ravi; Rafique, Asim; Press, Marcella",Cardiol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32595811/; https://doi.org/10.14740/cr1096,440

METHOD: A retrospective study was conducted by abstracting data from the electronic medical records of pediatric patients with COVID-19 from two major public hospitals in Al Ain. The data of patients from birth through 16 years of the cases with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were obtained. In addition to the epidemiological characteristics, transmission patterns, comorbidities, index cases, travel history, and coinfection with other viruses were analyzed. Cohen's kappa was used to assess interrater reliability and descriptive data. Chi-square test was used to assess significant differences between the variables and was conducted using Statistical Product and Service Solutions software. RESULTS: We identified 298 (150 males, 148 females) laboratory-confirmed cases. The patients’ median age was 7 years. Of these, 50% had parents who also tested positive.

616555,Ethical Issues in Intensive Care Units during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-09-11,"The well-recognized genome editing ability of the CRISPR-Cas system has triggered significant advances in CRISPR diagnostics. This has prompted an interest in developing new biosensing applications for nucleic acid detection. Recently, such applications have been engineered for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Increased demand for testing and consumables of RT-qPCR assays has led to the use of alternate testing options in some cases. Here we evaluate the accuracy and performance of a novel fluorescence based assay that received EUA authorization from the FDA for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The Specific High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK) technology forms the basis of the Sherlock CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit using the CRISPR-Cas13a system. Our experimental strategy included selection of COVID-19 patient samples from previously validated RT-qPCR assays. Positive samples were selected based on a broad range of cycle thresholds. A total of 50 COVID-19 patient samples were correctly diagnosed with 100% accuracy (relative fluorescence ratios: N gene 95% CI 23.2-36.3, ORF1ab gene 95% CI 27.6- 45.4). All controls, including RNase P, showed expected findings. Overall ratios were robustly distinct between positive and negative cases relative to the pre-established 5-fold change in fluorescence read output. We have evaluated the accuracy of detecting conserved targets of SARS-CoV-2 across a range of viral loads using the SHERLOCK CRISPR collateral detection reaction in a clinical setting. These findings demonstrate encouraging results, especially at a time when COVID-19 clinical diagnosis is in high demand; often with limited resources. This approach highlights new thinking in infectious disease identification and can be expanded to measure nucleic acids in other clinical isolates.","Khan, W. A.; Barney, R. E.; Tsongalis, G.

This model is calibrated to match key characteristics of COVID-19 transmission. An important calibration outcome is the age-dependent fraction of symptomatic cases, with this fraction for children found to be one-fifth of such fraction for adults. We apply the model to compare several intervention strategies, including restrictions on international air travel, case isolation, home quarantine, social distancing with varying levels of compliance, and school closures. School closures are not found to bring decisive benefits unless coupled with high level of social distancing compliance. We report several trade-offs, and an important transition across the levels of social distancing compliance, in the range between 70% and 80% levels, with compliance at the 90% level found to control the disease within 13–14 weeks, when coupled with effective case isolation and international travel restrictions.","Chang, Sheryl L.; Harding, Nathan; Zachreson, Cameron; Cliff, Oliver M.; Prokopenko, Mikhail",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19393-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33177507/,440

Rapid, Living Practice Points From the American College of Physicians (Version 1)",2021-03-16,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a range of illness severity. Mild illness has been reported, but whether illness severity correlates with infectivity is unknown. We describe the public health investigation of a mildly ill, non-hospitalized COVID-19 case who traveled to China. METHODS: The case was a Maricopa County resident with multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive specimens collected on January 22, 2020. Contacts were persons exposed to the case on or after the day before case diagnostic specimen collection. Contacts were monitored for 14 days after last known exposure. High-risk contacts had close, prolonged case contact (≥10 minutes within 2 meters). Medium-risk contacts wore all U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended personal protective equipment during interactions. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens were collected from the case and high-risk contacts and tested for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Paired case NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing at 11 time points. In 8 pairs (73%), ≥1 specimen tested positive or indeterminate, and in 3 pairs (27%) both tested negative. Specimens collected 18 days after diagnosis tested positive. Sixteen contacts were identified; 11 (69%) had high-risk exposure, including 1 intimate contact, and 5 (31%) had medium-risk exposure. In total, 35 high-risk contact NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing; all 35 pairs (100%) tested negative. CONCLUSIONS: This report demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause mild illness and result in positive tests for up to 18 days after diagnosis, without evidence of transmission to close contacts. These data might inform public health strategies to manage individuals with asymptomatic infection or mild illness.","Scott, Sarah E; Zabel, Karen; Collins, Jennifer; Hobbs, Katherine C; Kretschmer, Melissa J; Lach, Mitchell; Turnbow, Katie; Speck, Lindsay; White, Jessica R; Maldonado, Keila; Howard, Brandon; Fowler, Jeanene; Singh, Sonia; Robinson, Susan; Pompa, Alexandra Peterson; Chatham-Stephens, Kevin; Xie, Amy; Cates, Jordan; Lindstrom, Stephen; Lu, Xiaoyan; Rolfes, Melissa A; Flanagan, Marcy; Sunenshine, Rebecca",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32240285/,440

Non-HCW admissions were more likely to have at least one underlying disease (51.6% vs. 40.0%; p = 0.002), with hypertension (35.4%), diabetes (17.4%), and tuberculosis (8.2%) being the most common. Sixty-one (12.2%) died, comprising 1 HCW and 60 non-HCW (0.7% vs. 16.3%; p < 0.001). Among the non-HCW, no death occurred for the 0–10 years age group, but deaths were recorded across all other age groups. Compared to those who recovered, individuals who died were more likely to be older (p < 0.001), male (p = 0.015), report difficulty of breathing (p < 0.001), be HIV positive (p = 0.008), be intubated (p < 0.001), categorised as severe or critical (p < 0.001), have a shorter mean hospital stay (p < 0.001), or have an additional diagnosis of pneumonia (p < 0.001) or ARDS (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our analysis reflected significant differences in characteristics, symptomatology, and outcomes between healthcare and non-healthcare workers. Despite the unique mix of cohorts, our results support the country’s national guideline on COVID-19 vaccination which prioritises healthcare workers, the elderly, and people with comorbidities and immunodeficiency states.","Agrupis, Kristal An; Smith, Chris; Suzuki, Shuichi; Villanueva, Annavi Marie; Ariyoshi, Koya; Solante, Rontgene; Telan, Elizabeth Freda; Estrada, Kelly Anne; Uichanco, Ann Celestyn; Sagurit, Jocelyn; Calayo, Joy; Umipig, Dorcas; dela Merced, Zita; Villarama, Fe; Dimaano, Efren; Villarama, Jose Benito; Lopez, Edmundo; Sayo, Ana Ria",Trop Med Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41182-021-00340-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118992/,440

619907,Determination in Galicia of the required beds at Intensive Care Units,2020-10-06,"BACKGROUND: The Interaction between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein with Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cells is a crucial step for the viral entry and infection. Therefore, investigating the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction is of great importance for the prevention of the infection of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we aimed to establish a virus-free in vitro system to study the interaction between the spike protein and host cells of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Our results show that ACE2-overexpressing HEK293T cells are captured by immobilized spike S1 protein, and the cell capturing process can be inhibited by the receptor binding domain of the spike protein or antibodies against S protein. Furthermore, spike S1 protein variant with D614G mutant show a higher cell capturing ability than wild type spike S1 protein and stronger binding capacity of its receptor ACE2. In addition, the captured cells can be eluted as living cells for further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a new in vitro system for investigating the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host cells and purifying ACE2-expressing cells.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the association of race with incidence and outcomes of COVID-19, while controlling for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and comorbidities. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study included 2595 consecutive adults tested for COVID-19 from March 12 to March 31, 2020, at Froedtert Health and Medical College of Wisconsin (Milwaukee), the largest academic system in Wisconsin, with 879 inpatient beds (of which 128 are intensive care unit beds). EXPOSURES: Race (Black vs White, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, Native American or Alaska Native, Asian, or unknown). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Main outcomes included COVID-19 positivity, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and death. Additional independent variables measured and tested included socioeconomic status, sex, and comorbidities. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay was used to test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: A total of 2595 patients were included. The mean (SD) age was 53.8 (17.5) years, 978 (37.7%) were men, and 785 (30.2%) were African American patients. Of the 369 patients (14.2%) who tested positive for COVID-19, 170 (46.1%) were men, 148 (40.1%) were aged 60 years or older, and 218 (59.1%) were African American individuals. Positive tests were associated with Black race (odds ratio [OR], 5.37; 95% CI, 3.94-7.29; P = .001), male sex (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.21-2.00; P = .001), and age 60 years or older (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.53-2.73; P = .001). Zip code of residence explained 79% of the overall variance in COVID-19 positivity in the cohort (ρ = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58-0.91). Adjusting for zip code of residence, Black race (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.00-3.65; P = .04) and poverty (OR, 3.84; 95% CI, 1.20-12.30; P = .02) were associated with hospitalization. Poverty (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.08-11.80; P = .04) but not Black race (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.75-3.07; P = .24) was associated with intensive care unit admission. Overall, 20 (17.2%) deaths associated with COVID-19 were reported. Shortness of breath at presentation (OR, 10.67; 95% CI, 1.52-25.54; P = .02), higher body mass index (OR per unit of body mass index, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.05-1.35; P = .006), and age 60 years or older (OR, 22.79; 95% CI, 3.38-53.81; P = .001) were associated with an increased likelihood of death. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of adults tested for COVID-19 in a large midwestern academic health system, COVID-19 positivity was associated with Black race. Among patients with COVID-19, both race and poverty were associated with higher risk of hospitalization, but only poverty was associated with higher risk of intensive care unit admission. These findings can be helpful in targeting mitigation strategies for racial disparities in the incidence and outcomes of COVID-19.","Muñoz-Price, L.

STUDY DESIGN: Using a 24-month cohort study of 1700 women who delivered in eight Texas hospitals and were uninsured or publicly insured at the time of delivery, we focused on 456 women who used short-acting hormonal contraception within 6 months after delivery. We classified this sample according to characteristics and method preference, and estimated rates of discontinuation and associated predictors using life tables and Cox models. We assessed reasons for discontinuation and subsequent contraceptive use among those who discontinued. RESULTS: Roughly half used the pill and half used the injectable. One hundred seventy-eight (39%) expressed a baseline preference for the method they used, 162 (36%) preferred a long-acting reversible contraception method, and 41 (9%) preferred sterilization. After 1 year, 72% had discontinued [95% confidence interval (CI) 67.1–75.7]. Foreign-born Hispanic women were less likely to discontinue than U.S.-born Hispanics [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 0.65; 95% CI 0.50–0.84]. Those who wanted a more effective method (aHR, 1.44; 95% CI 1.12–1.85) and those who lost insurance coverage (aHR, 1.47; 95% CI 1.12–1.92) were more likely to discontinue. The most common reasons for discontinuation were side effects and access/cost. Of those who discontinued, 243 (68%) switched to a less effective or no method. Only 47 (13%) switched to their preferred method. CONCLUSIONS: Short-acting hormonal contraceptive discontinuation is high in this population. Many switch to less effective methods after discontinuation despite preferring methods at least as effective as the pill, patch, ring or injectable. IMPLICATIONS: Expanding contraceptive coverage in the 2 years after delivery should be a state and federal policy priority. In clinics, providers should discuss contraceptive preferences throughout pregnancy and the interpregnancy interval.","Burke, Kristen Lagasse; Thaxton, Lauren; Potter, Joseph E.",Contracept X,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33490950/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conx.2020.100052,440

Using an ecologies concept to explore how lay investors are articulated into global financial networks through robo advisors, this paper contributes to studies on the “financialization of everyday life”. It argues that investors are rendered passive by the disciplinary tools of algorithms, contemporary finance theories and elements of robo-advisor platforms that feed into these sociotechnological assemblages. The state's role in embedding citizen investors in these human-machine relationships is considered. The fragmented landscape of free, nonprofessional online financial advice and the opaque qualities of investing algorithms make investor subject formation incomplete and uncertain, especially when markets are highly volatile.

A lot has to be learned about how COVID-19 affects underlying diseases, and severe asthma is no exception. Methods: Narrative review of papers available until February 2021 in PubMed and Google Scholar, relating severe asthma and COVID-19. Four main research topics were reviewed: SARS-CoV-2 infection: immunology and respiratory pathology; interrelationship of severe asthma endotypes and COVID-19 disease mechanisms; severe asthma epidemiology and COVID-19; and biologics for severe asthma in the context of COVID-19. Results: COVID-19 disease mechanisms start with upper respiratory cell infection, and afterwards several immunological facets are activated, contributing to disease severity, namely cell-mediated immunity and antibody production. Although infrequent in the COVID-19 course some patients develop a cytokine storm that causes organ damage and may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome or multiorgan failure. Regarding severe asthma endotypes, type2-high might have a protective role both in infection risk and disease course. There is conflicting data regarding the epidemiological relationship between COVID-19 among severe asthma patients, with some studies reporting increased risk of infection and disease course, whereas others the other way round. Biologics for severe asthma do not seem to increase the risk of infection and severe COVID-19, although further evidence is needed. Conclusions: Globally, in the era of COVID-19, major respiratory societies recommend continuing the biologic treatment, preferably in a self-home administration program.","Gaspar-Marques, João; van Zeller, Mafalda; Carreiro-Martins, Pedro; Loureiro, Cláudia Chaves",Pulmonology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2531043721000891; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pulmoe.2021.04.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2531043721000891?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34053902/,440
627767,Challenges faced in establishing a dedicated 250 bed COVID-19 intensive care unit in a temporary structure,2020-11-06,"For many emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, definitive solutions via sterilizing adaptive immunity may require years or decades to develop, if they are even possible. The innate immune system offers alternative mechanisms that do not require antigen-specific recognition or a priori knowledge of the causative agent. However, it is unclear whether effective stable innate immune system activation can be achieved without triggering harmful autoimmunity or other chronic inflammatory sequelae. Here, we show that transgenic expression of a picornavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), in the absence of other viral proteins, can profoundly reconfigure mammalian innate antiviral immunity by exposing the normally membrane-sequestered RdRP activity to sustained innate immune detection. RdRP-transgenic mice have life-long, quantitatively dramatic upregulation of 80 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and show profound resistance to normally lethal viral challenge. Multiple crosses with defined knockout mice (Rag1, Mda5, Mavs, Ifnar1, Ifngr1, and Tlr3) established that the mechanism operates via MDA5 and MAVS and is fully independent of the adaptive immune system. Human cell models recapitulated the key features with striking fidelity, with the RdRP inducing an analogous ISG network and a strict block to HIV-1 infection. This RdRP-mediated antiviral mechanism does not depend on secondary structure within the RdRP mRNA but operates at the protein level and requires RdRP catalysis. Importantly, despite lifelong massive ISG elevations, RdRP mice are entirely healthy, with normal longevity. Our data reveal that a powerfully augmented MDA5-mediated activation state can be a well-tolerated mammalian innate immune system configuration. These results provide a foundation for augmenting innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum antiviral protection.","Painter, Meghan M.; Morrison, James H.; Zoecklein, Laurie J.; Rinkoski, Tommy A.; Watzlawik, Jens O.; Papke, Louisa M.; Warrington, Arthur E.; Bieber, Allan J.; Matchett, William E.; Turkowski, Kari L.; Poeschla, Eric M.; Rodriguez, Moses",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005311; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26633895/,440

The virus has now spread to over 168 countries including the United States, where the first cluster of cases was observed in the Seattle metropolitan area in Washington. Given the rapid increase in the number of cases in many localities, the availability of accurate, high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 testing is vital to efforts to manage the current public health crisis. In the course of optimizing SARS-CoV-2 testing performed by the University of Washington Clinical Virology Lab (UW Virology Lab), we evaluated assays using seven different primer-probe sets and one assay kit.

Scholars have stated that it is characteristic for political populism to describe society as a fundamental struggle between an allegedly virtuous people and political elites which are portrayed negatively. This anti-elitist sentiment not only targets politicians, however, but also other representatives of the alleged establishment—including scientists and scholarly institutions. But the specifics of such science-related populism have not yet been conceptualized. We aim to do so, integrating scholarship on political populism, the “participatory turn,” and alternative epistemologies. We propose to conceptualize science-related populism as a set of ideas which suggests that there is a morally charged antagonism between an (allegedly) virtuous ordinary people and an (allegedly) unvirtuous academic elite, and that this antagonism is due to the elite illegitimately claiming and the people legitimately demanding both science-related decision-making sovereignty and truth-speaking sovereignty.","Mede, Niels G.; Schäfer, Mike S.",Public Underst Sci,https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662520924259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32515652/,440

To remain safe, individuals must take preventive measures. Health behavior theories suggest that perceived risk is a key determinant of engagement in preventive behavior. People often underestimate their risk for disease compared with similar others’, a phenomenon known as optimistic bias (OB). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore how OB affected individuals' engagement in COVID-19 preventive behavior/intentions. Based on health behavior theories, this study considered risk perception and risk response as mediators of the relationship between OB and individuals’ preventive health behaviors and intentions. METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional survey design. Online survey platforms were used to recruit U.S. adults. A total of 293 valid responses were included in the analyses. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship of OB to the respondents’ health information seeking intention and related behavioral outcomes. RESULTS: Results from the first regression model showed that OB was negatively related to risk perception. In other words, optimistically biased respondents perceived their risk of COVID-19 to be low. The second model demonstrated that perceived risk was related positively to affective responses to risk (e.g., worry and fear). That is, the lower their perceived risk of COVID-19, the less likely respondents were to feel anxiety and fear about this disease. Models 3 and 4 revealed positive relationships between risk response and respondents’ intentions and behaviors. Finally, the results supported a fully mediated pathway: OB → risk perception → risk response → information seeking intention and behavioral outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings suggest that by decreasing their perceived risk and subsequent responses, optimistic bias can undermine individuals’ motivation to take precautions. To reduce this bias, the actual risk of COVID-19 should be reinforced.","Park, Taehwan; Ju, Ilwoo; Ohs, Jennifer E.; Hinsley, Amber",Res Social Adm Pharm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33317765/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.06.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551741120306811; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1551741120306811,440

One of the gaps in our current knowledge relates to the long-term mental and physical impact of the infection on affected individuals. The COVID-19 pandemic hit the Netherlands at the end of February 2020, resulting in over 900,000 people testing positive for the virus, over 24,000 hospitalizations, and over 13,000 deaths by the end of January 2021. Although many patients recover from the acute phase of the disease, experience with other virus outbreaks has raised concerns regarding possible late sequelae of the infection. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop an online tool to assess the long-term burden of COVID-19 in patients. METHODS: In this paper, we describe the process of development, assessment, programming, implementation, and use of this new tool: the assessment of burden of COVID-19 (ABCoV) tool. This new tool is based on the well-validated assessment of burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease tool. RESULTS: As of January 2021, the new ABCoV tool has been used in an online patient platform by more than 2100 self-registered patients and another 400 patients in a hospital setting, resulting in over 2500 patients. These patients have submitted the ABCoV questionnaire 3926 times. Among the self-registered patients who agreed to have their data analyzed (n=1898), the number of females was high (n=1153, 60.7%), many were medically diagnosed with COVID-19 (n=892, 47.0%), and many were relatively young with only 7.4% (n=141) being older than 60 years. Of all patients that actually used the tool (n=1517), almost one-quarter (n=356, 23.5%) used the tool twice, and only a small group (n=76, 5.0%) used the tool 6 times.

Four viral surface glycoproteins (gB, gD, gH and gL) are required. This review summarises the known structure and function of each of these essential viral envelope glycoproteins, and explores what is known about their close cooperation with each other in mediating cellular membrane fusion. It is suggested that, following gD binding to one of its entry receptors, membrane fusion is mediated by gB and the heterodimer gH/gL. Significantly, these four entry glycoproteins also play a key role in the interaction between HSV and the host immune system. The glycoproteins serve an important role as targets of adaptive immunity. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the same proteins also play a key role in initiating the early innate immune response to HSV.

S exhibits substantial conformational flexibility. It transitions from closed to open conformations to expose its receptor binding site, and subsequently from prefusion to postfusion conformations to mediate fusion of viral and cellular membranes. S protein derivatives are components of vaccine candidates and diagnostic assays, as well as tools for research into the biology and immunology of SARS-CoV-2. Here we have designed mutations in S which allow production of thermostable, crosslinked, S protein trimers that are trapped in the closed, pre-fusion, state. We have determined the structures of crosslinked and non-crosslinked proteins, identifying two distinct closed conformations of the S trimer. We demonstrate that the designed, thermostable, closed S trimer can be used in serological assays. This protein has potential applications as a reagent for serology, virology and as an immunogen.","Xiong, Xiaoli; Qu, Kun; Ciazynska, Katarzyna A.; Hosmillo, Myra; Carter, Andrew P.; Ebrahimi, Soraya; Ke, Zunlong; Scheres, Sjors H.W.; Bergamaschi, Laura; Grice, Guinevere L.; Zhang, Ying; Nathan, James A.; Baker, Stephen; James, Leo C.; Baxendale, Helen E.; Goodfellow, Ian; Doffinger, Rainer; Briggs, John A.G.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.152835,440

SUMMARY: The leadership of a department of pharmacy at an urban medical center in the US epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic proactively created a pharmacy action plan in anticipation of a surge in admissions of critically ill patients with COVID-19. It was essential to create guidance documents outlining workflow, provide comprehensive staff education, and repurpose non–intensive care unit (ICU)-trained clinical pharmacotherapy specialists to work in ICUs. Teamwork was crucial to ensure staff safety, develop complete scheduling, maintain adequate drug inventory and sterile compounding, optimize the electronic health record and automated dispensing cabinets to help ensure appropriate prescribing and effective management of medication supplies, and streamline the pharmacy workflow to ensure that all patients received pharmacotherapeutic regimens in a timely fashion. CONCLUSION: Each hospital should view the COVID-19 crisis as an opportunity to internally review and enhance workflow processes, initiatives that can continue even after the resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Merchan, Cristian; Soliman, Joshua; Ahuja, Tania; Arnouk, Serena; Keeley, Kelsey; Tracy, Joanna; Guerra, Gabriel; DaCosta, Kristopher; Papadopoulos, John; Dabestani, Arash",Am J Health Syst Pharm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34279582/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxaa212,440

Closure of schools and cases of sexual gender based violence also impacted the prevalence of early marriage during the pandemic in Nigeria. We also argue in this commentary that the pandemic has so much impacted on programs aimed at ending early marriage in the nation. Therefore, if serious and concerted efforts are not taken by relevant stakeholders, more girls will be at risk of early marriage and teenage pregnancy with their related health consequences.

Mast cells sense disruptions in the local microenvironment and are first responders to physical, chemical and biological insults. When activated, mast cells release growth factors, proteases, chemotactic proteins and cytokines thereby mobilizing and amplifying the reactions of the innate and adaptive immune system. Mast cells are therefore significant regulators of homeostatic functions and may be essential in microenvironmental changes during pathogen invasion and disease. During infection by helminths, bacteria and viruses, mast cells release antimicrobial factors to facilitate pathogen expulsion and eradication. Mast cell-derived proteases and growth factors protect tissues from insect/snake bites and exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Finally, mast cells release mediators that promote wound healing in the inflammatory, proliferative and remodelling stages. Since mast cells have such a powerful repertoire of functions, targeting mast cells may be an effective new strategy for immunotherapy of disease and design of novel vaccine adjuvants. In this review, we will examine how certain strategies that specifically target and activate mast cells can be used to treat and resolve infections, augment vaccines and heal wounds. Although these strategies may be protective in certain circumstances, mast cells activation may be deleterious if not carefully controlled and any therapeutic strategy using mast cell activators must be carefully explored.","Willows, Steven; Kulka, Marianna",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33352850/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9122713,440

There is little research about psychiatric complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The aim of the study was to describe the psychiatric clinical profile and pharmacological interactions in COVID-19 inpatients referred to a Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry (CLP) unit. This is a cross-sectional study, carried out at a tertiary hospital in Spain, in inpatients admitted because of COVID-19 and referred to our CLP Unit from March 17,2020 to April 28,2020. Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records. The patients were divided in three groups depending on psychiatric diagnosis: delirium, severe mental illness (SMI) and non-severe mental illness (NSMI). Of 71 patients included (median [ICR] age 64 [54–73] years; 70.4% male), 35.2% had a delirium, 18.3% had a SMI, and 46.5% had a NSMI. Compared to patients with delirium and NSMI, patients with SMI were younger, more likely to be institutionalized and were administered less anti-COVID19 drugs. Mortality was higher among patients with delirium (21.7%) than those with SMI (0%) or NSMI (9.45%). The rate of side effects due to interactions between anti-COVID19 and psychiatric drugs was low, mainly drowsiness (4.3%) and borderline QTc prolongation (1.5%). Patients affected by SMI were more often undertreated for COVID-19. However, the rate of interactions was very low, and avoidable with a proper evaluation and drug-dose adjustment. Half of the patients with SMI were institutionalized, suggesting that living conditions in residential facilities could make them more vulnerable to infection.","Arbelo, Nestor; López-Pelayo, Hugo; Sagué, María; Madero, Santiago; Pinzón-Espinosa, Justo; Gomes-da-Costa, Susana; Ilzarbe, Lidia; Anmella, Gerard; Llach, Cristian-Daniel; Imaz, María-Luisa; Cámara, María-Mercé; Pintor, Luis",Psychiatr Q,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09868-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411128/,440

This approach mainly attempts to minimize the number of hospital beds as well as emergency beds requirement for the treatment of COVID-19 infected patients to handle such a critical situation. In this work, higher priority has given to severe COVID-19 infected patients as compared to mild COVID-19 infected patients to handle this critical situation so that the survival probability of the COVID-19 infected patients can be increased.

The symptoms vary from person to person and many are “hidden carriers.” Few people experience immediate reaction and even death within 48 h of infection. However, many show mild to chronic symptoms and recover. Nevertheless, the death rate due to COVID-19 transmission is high especially among patients with non-communicable diseases. The purpose of this review is to provide evidence to consider vitamins as epigenetic modifiers to enhance immunity and reduce inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients with non-communicable diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical evidence has suggested the risk of getting infected is high among individuals with non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, cancer, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and renal disease, as well as the elderly with high mortality rate among the cohort. The impact is due to an already compromised immune system of patients. Every patient has a different response to COVID-19, which shows that the ability to combat the deadly virus varies individually. Thus, treatment can be personalized and adjusted to help protect and combat COVID-19 infections, especially in individuals with non-communicable diseases. SUMMARY: Based on current published scientific and medical evidence, the suggestions made in this article for combination of vitamin therapy as epigenetic modifiers to control the unregulated inflammatory and cytokine marker expressions, further needs to be clinically proven. Future research and clinical trials can apply the suggestions given in this article to support metabolic activities in patients and enhance the immune response.","Singh, Varsha",Curr Nutr Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13668-020-00330-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32661859/,440

After presenting three key predicaments faced by synagogues as regards security, the article argues that securitization should be understood as a form of “white noise,” necessary to religious institutions’ functioning and yet necessarily invisible. Indeed, although security is now an essential feature of many synagogues, it is also at constant risk of undermining their cordial ambience through providing a reminder of one’s mortality, requiring that it be present, but in the background.

Timely diagnosis is imperative for their prognosis and recovery. This case describes an otherwise healthy 55-year-old man with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilatory support secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia. Massive acute pulmonary embolism with right heart failure complicated his course. CASE: A healthy 55-year-old man presented to our emergency department (ED) with a sore throat, cough, and myalgia. A nasopharyngeal swab was obtained, and he was discharged for home quarantine. His swab turned positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) on day 2 of his ED visit. A week later, he represented with worsening shortness of breath, requiring intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Initially, he was easy to oxygenate, had no hemodynamic compromise, and was afebrile. On day 3, he became febrile and developed significant hemodynamic instability requiring maximum vasopressor support and oxygenation difficulty. His ECG revealed sinus tachycardia with S1Q3T3 pattern. On bedside TTE, there was evidence of right heart strain and elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 45 mmHg. All data was indicative of a massive APE as the etiology for his hemodynamic collapse. A decision was made to forgo computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), given his clinical instability, and systemic thrombolytic therapy was administered. Within the next 12-24 hours, his hemodynamic status significantly improved. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of considering massive APE in COVID-19 patients as a cause of the sudden and rapid hemodynamic decline. Furthermore, timely diagnosis can be made to aid in appropriate management with the help of bedside TTE and ECG in cases where CTPA is not feasible secondary to the patient's hemodynamic instability.","Hegde, Shruti; Yesodharan, Gemini; Tedrow, John; Goldman, Alena",Case Rep Crit Care,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8875330; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33133702/,440

Feminist activism in critical times: Lessons from the women's march on Washington,2020-05-11,"During the on‐going COVID‐19 pandemic a number of key public health services have been severely impacted. These include elective surgical services due to the synergetic resources required to provide both perioperative surgical care whilst also treating acute COVID‐19 patients and also the poor outcomes associated with surgical patients who develop COVID‐19 in the perioperative period. This article discusses the important principles and concepts for providing important surgical services during the COVID‐19 pandemic based on the model of the RMCancerSurgHub which is providing surgical cancer services for a population of approximately 2 million people across London during the pandemic. The model focusses on creating local and regional hub centres which provide urgent treatment for surgical patients in an environment that is relatively protected from the burden of COVID‐19 illness. The model extensively utilises the extended multidisciplinary team to allow for a flexible approach with core services delivered in ‘clean’ sites which can adapt to viral surges. A key requirement is that of a clinical prioritisation process which allows for equity in access within and between specialties ensuring that patients are treated on the basis of greatest need, while at the same time protecting those whose conditions can safely wait from exposure to the virus. Importantly, this model has the ability to scale‐up activity and lead units and networks into the recovery phase. The model discussed is also broadly applicable to providing surgical services during any viral pandemic.","Kasivisvanathan, Ramanathan; Tilney, Henry S.; Jhanji, Shaman; O’Mahony, Michelle; Gruber, Pascale; Nicol, David; Morgan, Dominic; Kipps, Emma; Rasheed, Shahnawaz",Int J Health Plann Manage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046937/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3243,440

In this study, questionnaires were distributed in seven major geographic regions of Chinese mainland to investigate the public’s awareness and agreement with information related to the utilization of wildlife in order to measure the impact of information on various issues relating wildlife conservation and utilization. The Chinese public had the greatest awareness and agreement with information that prevents unsustainable and illegal utilization, and the least awareness and agreement with information that promotes unsustainable utilization. It is also noteworthy that the Chinese public have higher levels of awareness and agreement with information that does not support utilization than with information that supports sustainable utilization. From our research, we can conclude that overall the public tends to support and be informed by a purist view of conservation, and there is significantly less support for conservation based on sustainable utilization. On this basis, we suggest that in the future, conservation education should seek to balance the public’s respect and love for nature which is often inspired by social media, with more scientific information about scientific understandings that influence conservation policy and practice. ABSTRACT: The widespread dissemination of information related to wildlife utilization in new online media and traditional media undoubtedly impacts societal conservation concepts and attitudes, thus triggering public discussions on the relationship between conservation and utilization. A study on how public attitudes and concepts are affected by the related information on wildlife utilization is helpful to implement the scientific wildlife conservation and management strategies, and to propose targeted measures to optimize the information environment. We designed the questionnaire to investigate the public’s awareness and agreement with related information on wildlife utilization so as to measure how information with different dissemination channels, source types, and content orientation influenced the public’s concept of wildlife conservation and utilization. The questionnaire was distributed in seven major geographical regions throughout China. Out of a total of 1645 questionnaires that were collected, 1294 questionnaires were valid, with an effective rate of 78.7%. Results show that respondents had the greatest awareness of information on preventing unsustainable and illegal utilization, and the lowest awareness of information on promoting unsustainable utilization, and that awareness of information that against utilization was higher than that of information which supported sustainable utilization. At the same time, respondents showed the greatest agreement for information on preventing unsustainable utilization and the lowest agreement for information on promoting unsustainable utilization; also, their agreement with information that against utilization was higher than that for information which supported sustainable use. Respondents had a high level of awareness of information on wildlife related to COVID-19 provided by experts. Gender, age, the level of development of the city in which they live, education, vegetarianism, and religious beliefs all affected respondents’ agreement with related information on wildlife utilization. This research suggests that the publicity and education of scientific conservation methods should be emphasized in the future conservation education. In addition, scholars in the field of wildlife research should assume the role of ‘influencer’ and give full play to the scientific guidance of public opinion.","Song, Zhifan; Wang, Qiang; Miao, Zhen; Conrad, Kirsten; Zhang, Wei; Zhou, Xuehong; MacMillan, Douglas C.",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34573606/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11092640,440

The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, and China Science and Technology Journal databases were searched to identify studies published between January 1 and April 21, 2020 that assayed inflammatory markers in COVID-19 patients. Three reviewers independently examined the literature, extracted relevant data, and assessed the risk of publication bias before including the meta-analysis studies. Fifty-six studies involving 8719 COVID-19 patients were identified. Meta-analysis showed that patients with severe disease showed elevated levels of white blood cell count (WMD: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.78–1.52), C-reactive protein (WMD: 38.85, 95% CI: 31.19–46.52), procalcitonin (WMD: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.06–0.11), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (WMD: 10.15, 95% CI: 5.03–15.46), interleukin-6 (WMD: 23.87, 95% CI: 15.95–31.78), and interleukin-10 (WMD: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.97–2.28). Similarly, COVID-19 patients who died during follow-up showed significantly higher levels of white blood cell count (WMD: 4.11, 95% CI: 3.25–4.97), C-reactive protein (WMD: 74.18, 95% CI: 56.63–91.73), procalcitonin (WMD: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.11–0.42), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (WMD: 10.94, 95% CI: 4.79–17.09), and interleukin-6 (WMD: 59.88, 95% CI: 19.46–100.30) than survivors. Severe COVID-19 is associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers than a mild disease, so tracking these markers may allow early identification or even prediction of disease progression.","Ji, Pan; Zhu, Jieyun; Zhong, Zhimei; Li, Hongyuan; Pang, Jielong; Li, Bocheng; Zhang, Jianfeng",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33217868/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000023315,440

The causative pathogen was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (6 bacteria), multiple reverse transcription-PCR (MPCR; 11 viruses), bacterial culture, and serology. The initial chemotherapy was evaluated based on the pathogens identified using PCR. We found 27 viral cases (23.1%), 25 bacterial cases (21.4%), 45 mixed infections with virus and bacteria (38.5%), 10 Mycoplasma pneumoniae (8.5%), 7 mixed infections with M. pneumoniae and another pathogen (6.0%), 1 Chlamydophila pneumoniae (0.9%), and 2 unknown pathogens (1.7%). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae accounted for 58 (49.5%) and 27 (23.0%) of the cases, respectively. The median values (50%) of the white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) using the box-and-whisker and plot method, respectively, were 11.7 × 103 mm−3 and 1.4mg/dl in viral infections, 15.6 × 103 mm−3 and 4.8mg/dl in mixed infections with virus and bacteria, 17.8 × 103 mm−3 and 6.3mg/dl in bacterial infections, 6.7 × 103 mm−3 and 1.4mg/dl in M. pneumoniae infections, and 21.5 × 103 mm−3 and 6.4mg/dl in mixed infections with M. pneumoniae and other bacterial infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin (n =61), carbapenems (n =12), and ceftriaxone (n =7) were selected for the patients suspected of having bacterial infections alone or mixed infections with bacterial and viruses in accordance with our criteria defined tentatively. For those with M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae infections, azithromycin or minocycline was initially used. Treatments averaged 3–5 days. The empirical chemotherapy was improper in 9.4% of cases in relation to the etiologic agents finally identified. We conclude that rapid and comprehensive identification using PCR can provide optimal antimicrobial chemotherapy for CAP patients.","Nakayama, Eiichi; Hasegawa, Keiko; Morozumi, Miyuki; Kobayashi, Reiko; Chiba, Naoko; Ubukata, Kimiko; Iitsuka, Taketoshi; Tajima, Takeshi; Sunakawa, Keisuke",Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X07708309; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X07708309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17982719/,440

We performed a systematic review to evaluate presentations, postinfection change in the manifestation, diagnosis, and management of flare-ups of underlying dermatologic disease in patients with COVID-19. A total of 17 articles were recovered reporting on flare-ups of dermatological disease including pemphigus vulgaris, psoriasis, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau, systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma, and Sézary syndrome (SS). Out of these, psoriasis and alopecia areata were the most common conditions. However, most cases of psoriasis could have been attributed to either antimalarial agents that were initially used for the treatment of COVID-19 or discontinuation of treatment following SARS-CoV2 infection.","Aram, Khashayar; Patil, Anant; Goldust, Mohamad; Rajabi, Fateme",Dermatol Ther,https://doi.org/10.1111/dth.15113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34453380/,440
673709,Antibiotic misuse during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Recipe for Disaster,2021-06-11,"The cellular mechanisms by which hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication might mediate cytopathic effects are controversial and not entirely clear. In this study, we found that blood‐borne HCV (bbHCV) infection could lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)‐stress and mitochondria‐related/caspase‐dependent apoptosis at the early stages of infection based on use of the highly efficient bbHCV cell culture model established previously. Sections of bbHCV‐infected human fetal liver stem cells (hFLSCs) revealed convolution and nonlinear ER, cell vacuolization, swelling of mitochondria, and numerous double membrane vesicles (DMVs). The percentage of apoptotic hFLSCs infected by bbHCV reached 29.8% at 16 h postinfection, and the amount of cytochrome c increased remarkably in the cytosolic protein fraction. However, over time, apoptosis was inhibited due to the activation of NF‐κB. The expression of NF‐κB‐p65, Bcl‐xL, XIAP, and c‐FLIPL in hFLSCs was increased significantly 24 h after in infection by bbHCV. The accelerated cell death cycles involving apoptosis, regeneration and repair by bbHCV infection might give rise to the development of cirrhosis, and ultimately to hepatocellular carcinogenesis.

To identify scientific evidence on the use and results of information and communication technologies for the improvement of neonatal health in general or specific health problems or interventions, and to describe the type of intervention and its results. METHODS. A systematic review of the available evidence was performed. The search was carried out in peer-reviewed journals between January 1, 2008 and April 30, 2018, in English and Spanish. The searched key terms were (health informatics OR telemedicine OR mHealth) AND (newborn OR newborn care OR neonatal care). RESULTS. From a total of 305 articles initially identified, 10 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The main domains of eHealth identified as applied to neonatal health were telemedicine (3 studies), eLearning (1 study) and mHealth (7 studies). Target population were health care providers or parents. The studies aimed at diagnosis, provision of health care and training, promoting adherence to interventions in parents or improving quality of care. CONCLUSIONS. The use of eHealth in general and specifically focused on neonatal health shows important possibilities for development and expansion, given the advances and present needs, and should be considered a key tool for the reduction of inequalities.","Duran, Pablo; Sommer, Janine A; Otero, Paula; Daus, Mariana; Benitez, Sonia; Serruya, Suzanne; Francisco, Luis Andres De",Rev Panam Salud Publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33196698/; https://doi.org/10.26633/rpsp.2020.123,440
675439,"The Dignity of the Frail: : On Compassion, Terror, and Social Death",2020,"Background and objectives: The whole world is spending an extraordinary effort by implementing various measures to control and prevent the COVID-19 pandemic. The effectiveness of the preventive measures is greatly influenced by the public’s knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards the disease. In this study, KAP values and some characteristic features of people recovered from COVID-19 were determined by conducting a questionnaire survey. Materials and Methods: The questionnaire survey was conducted between 1 and 10 January 2021 on people who recovered from COVID-19 in a total of 150 different locations in Turkey. The questionnaire consisted of 46 questions: 14 for determining demographic and some characteristic features of the participants, and 32 for determining their knowledge, attitudes, and practices. The data obtained were evaluated using descriptive statistics, chi-squared tests, t-tests, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: It was determined that 63% of the participants had at least one chronic illness, 3.9% suffered from the disease twice, and 45.2% changed their smoking habits. The average knowledge score of the participants about COVID-19 was calculated as 10.25 (SD = 2.37; range 0–15). The participants were found to have a high level of knowledge about the symptoms and prevention methods in general, and positive changes in post-illness attitudes and behaviors. However, there was a great instability regarding the drugs and vaccines used in the treatment of COVID-19. Conclusions: This was the first study carried out in Turkey to determine knowledge, attitudes, practices, and some characteristic features of people who recovered from COVID-19. It was suggested that health authorities in the country need to develop more effective strategies and policies to find out permanent solutions in order to control and prevent the COVID-19 pandemic by taking into account the concerns of the public, particularly with regards to the drugs used in the treatment and vaccination.","Yakut, Seda; Karagülle, Burcu; Atçalı, Tuğçe; Öztürk, Yasin; Açık, Mehmet Nuri; Çetinkaya, Burhan",Medicina (Kaunas),https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57050431; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33946186/,440

The long process of negotiating this breakthrough has been cited as an example of successful global health diplomacy. This paper analyses this negotiation process, drawing on government documents, formal representations from both sides of the Taiwan Strait, and key informant interviews. The actors and their motivations, along with the forums, practices and outcomes of the negotiation process, are detailed. While it is argued that non-traditional diplomatic action was important in establishing the case for Taiwan’s inclusion at the WHA, traditional concerns regarding Taiwanese sovereignty and diplomatic representation ultimately played a decisive role. The persistent influence of these traditional diplomatic questions illustrates the limits of global health diplomacy.","Herington, Jonathan; Lee, Kelley",Global Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25270977/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-014-0071-y,440

687046,Association between COVID‐19 and chilblains: a case–control study,2021-03-11,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by substantial heterogeneity in clinical, biochemical, and physiological characteristics. However, the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19 infection is poorly understood. Previous studies established clinical and biological phenotypes among classical ARDS cohorts, with important therapeutic implications. The phenotypic profile of COVID-19 associated ARDS remains unknown. METHODS: We used latent class modeling via a multivariate mixture model to identify phenotypes from clinical and biochemical data collected from 263 patients admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital intensive care unit with COVID-19-associated ARDS between March 13 and August 2, 2020. FINDINGS: We identified two distinct phenotypes of COVID-19-associated ARDS, with substantial differences in biochemical profiles despite minimal differences in respiratory dynamics. The minority phenotype (class 2, n = 70, 26·6%) demonstrated increased markers of coagulopathy, with mild relative hyper-inflammation and dramatically increased markers of end-organ dysfunction (e.g., creatinine, troponin). The odds of 28-day mortality among the class 2 phenotype was more than double that of the class 1 phenotype (40·0% vs.· 23·3%, OR = 2·2, 95% CI [1·2, 3·9]). INTERPRETATION: We identified distinct phenotypic profiles in COVID-19 associated ARDS, with little variation according to respiratory physiology but with important variation according to systemic and extra-pulmonary markers. Phenotypic identity was highly associated with short-term mortality. The class 2 phenotype exhibited prominent signatures of coagulopathy, suggesting that vascular dysfunction may play an important role in the clinical progression of severe COVID-19-related disease.","Ranjeva, Sylvia; Pinciroli, Riccardo; Hodell, Evan; Mueller, Ariel; Hardin, C.Corey; Thompson, B.Taylor; Berra, Lorenzo",EClinicalMedicine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589537021001097; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537021001097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33875978/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100829,440

These model predictions have shown a wide range of variations. In our study, we demonstrate that nonidentifiability in model calibrations using the confirmed-case data is the main reason for such wide variations. Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for model selection, we show that an SIR model performs much better than an SEIR model in representing the information contained in the confirmed-case data. This indicates that predictions using more complex models may not be more reliable compared to using a simpler model. We present our model predictions for the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan after the lockdown and quarantine of the city on January 23, 2020. We also report our results of modeling the impacts of the strict quarantine measures undertaken in the city after February 7 on the time course of the epidemic, and modeling the potential of a second outbreak after the return-to-work in the city.","Roda, Weston C.; Varughese, Marie B.; Han, Donglin; Li, Michael Y.",Infect Dis Model,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720300075; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042720300075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289100/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.03.001,440

At this point, psychodermatology forms a common field of study based on the relationship and interaction between psychiatry and dermatology. Cosmetology is a special group within dermatology, and the psychosocial needs of this group differ. In this study, it was aimed to examine the moods such as anxiety, fear and depression experienced by the patients during their application to the cosmetology unit during the COVID‐19 pandemic process and to compare them with the control group. A total of 162 cases, 80 cases from the cosmetology unit meeting the specified conditions and 82 cases as the control group, were retrospectively evaluated. In all participants, the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) scores decreased significantly compared to the beginning of the pandemic (P = .001). In the study, while depression (HAM‐D) and general anxiety (HAM‐A) were higher in the cosmetology group compared to the control group (P = .049 and P = .001, respectively), there was no difference in coronavirus anxiety scores (CAS) (P = .24). It should be known that patients who underwent cosmetological procedures during the pandemic period may have anxiety and depression. In this patient group, which requires a special psychodermatological approach, pandemic effects should also be considered. In patients who apply to cosmetology units during the pandemic period, attention should be paid to the relationship between surreal cosmetological process requests and their anxiety and depression state.","Temiz, Selami Aykut; Durmaz, Koray; Dursun, Recep; Ataseven, Arzu; Işık, Begüm; Karaağaç, Onur; Özer, İlkay; Daye, Munise",Dermatol Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33274539/; https://doi.org/10.1111/dth.14625,440

MATERIALS AND METHODS: On June 18, 2020, we identified frequently used eligibility criteria from all the interventional COVID-19 trials in ClinicalTrials.gov (n = 288), including age, pregnancy, oxygen saturation, alanine/aspartate aminotransferase, platelets, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. We applied the frequently used criteria to the EHR data of COVID-19 patients in Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) (March 2020–June 2020) and evaluated their impact on patient accrual and the occurrence of a composite endpoint of mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, and in-hospital death. RESULTS: There were 3251 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from the CUIMC EHR included in the analysis. The median follow-up period was 10 days (interquartile range 4–28 days). The composite events occurred in 18.1% (n = 587) of the COVID-19 cohort during the follow-up. In a hypothetical trial with common eligibility criteria, 33.6% (690/2051) were eligible among patients with evaluable data and 22.2% (153/690) had the composite event. DISCUSSION: By adjusting the thresholds of common eligibility criteria based on the characteristics of COVID-19 patients, we could observe more composite events from fewer patients. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrated the potential of using the EHR data of COVID-19 patients to inform the selection of eligibility criteria and their thresholds, supporting data-driven optimization of participant selection towards improved statistical power of COVID-19 trials.","Kim, Jae Hyun; Ta, Casey N; Liu, Cong; Sung, Cynthia; Butler, Alex M; Stewart, Latoya A; Ena, Lyudmila; Rogers, James R; Lee, Junghwan; Ostropolets, Anna; Ryan, Patrick B; Liu, Hao; Lee, Shing M; Elkind, Mitchell S V; Weng, Chunhua",J Am Med Inform Assoc,https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260201/,440
