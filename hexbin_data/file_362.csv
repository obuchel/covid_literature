2567,Dynamic driving pressure associated mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,2017-01-25,"BACKGROUND: The survival predictors and optimal mechanical ventilator settings in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are uncertain. This study was designed to investigate the influences of clinical variables and mechanical ventilation settings on the outcomes for severe ARDS patients receiving ECMO. METHODS: We reviewed severe ARDS patients who received ECMO due to refractory hypoxemia from May 2006 to October 2015. Serial mechanical ventilator settings before and after ECMO and factors associated with survival were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 158 severe ARDS patients received ECMO were finally analyzed. Overall intensive care unit (ICU) mortality was 55.1%. After ECMO initiation, tidal volume, peak inspiratory pressure and dynamic driving pressure were decreased, while positive end-expiratory pressure levels were relative maintained. After ECMO initiation, nonsurvivors had significantly higher dynamic driving pressure until day 7 than survivors. Cox proportional hazards regression model revealed that immunocompromised [hazard ratio 1.957; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.216–3.147; p = 0.006], Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (hazard ratio 1.039; 95% CI 1.005–1.073; p = 0.023), ARDS duration before ECMO (hazard ratio 1.002; 95% CI 1.000–1.003; p = 0.029) and mean dynamic driving pressure from day 1 to 3 on ECMO (hazard ratio 1.070; 95% CI 1.026–1.116; p = 0.002) were independently associated with ICU mortality. CONCLUSIONS: For severe ARDS patients receiving ECMO, immunocompromised status, APACHE II score and the duration of ARDS before ECMO initiation were significantly associated with ICU survival. Higher dynamic driving pressure during first 3 days of ECMO support was also independently associated with increased ICU mortality.","Chiu, Li-Chung; Hu, Han-Chung; Hung, Chen-Yiu; Chang, Chih-Hao; Tsai, Feng-Chun; Yang, Cheng-Ta; Huang, Chung-Chi; Wu, Huang-Pin; Kao, Kuo-Chin",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5267613/,362
5753,"High survival in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome treated by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, minimal sedation, and pressure supported ventilation",2000-10-14,"Objective: To evaluate thrombogenicity of prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) in critically ill patients.¶Design: Prospective clinical study.¶Setting: Medical intensive care unit at a university hospital.¶Patients: 16 consecutive patients suffering from acquired deficiencies of coagulation factors and with either overt bleeding from any site or a planned invasive procedure.¶Interventions: 2000 factor IX units of PCCs intravenously.¶Measurements and results: Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial prothrombin time, fibrinogen, platelet count, plasma levels of coagulation factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, antithrombin, protein C, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), prothrombin fragment F(1+2), and the fibrin degradation product D-dimer were measured prior to and 1, 3, and 24 h after administration of PCCs. PT as well as coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, TAT, and F(1+2) showed a significant increase after administration of PCCs. All other parameters remained unchanged.¶Conclusions: Administration of PCCs induces thrombin generation. No evidence for induction of disseminated intravascular coagulation in biochemical terms could be found. When rapid correction of acquired coagulation factor disturbances is warranted, the use of PCCs seems reasonable, but the elevated risk of intravascular thrombus formation should be kept in mind.","Staudinger, T.; Frass, M.; Rintelen, C.; Quehenberger, P.; Wagner, O.; Stoiser, B.; Locker, G.

5835,Liver inflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome in a patient receiving hepatitis B vaccine: a possible relationship?,1997,"RATIONALE: The standard of care for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been developed based on studies that usually excluded patients with major comorbidities. OBJECTIVES: To describe treatments and outcomes according to comorbidities in patients with ARDS admitted to 19 ICUs (1997–2014). METHODS: Patients were grouped based on comorbidities. Determinants of day-28 mortality were identified by multivariable Cox analysis stratified on center. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 4953 ARDS patients, 2545 (51.4%) had major comorbidities; the proportion with major comorbidities increased after 2008. Hematological malignancy was associated with severe ARDS and rescue therapies for refractory hypoxemia. COPD, HIV infection, and hematological malignancy were associated with a lower likelihood of invasive mechanical ventilation on the admission day. Admission-day SOFA score was higher in patients with major comorbidities, who more often received vasopressors, dialysis, or treatment-limitation decisions. Day-28 mortality was 33.7% overall, 27.2% in patients without major comorbidities, and 31.1% (COPD) to 56% (hematological malignancy) in patients with major comorbidities. By multivariable analysis, mortality was lower in patients with COPD and higher in those with chronic heart failure, solid tumors, or hematological malignancies. Mortality was independently associated with P(a)O(2)/F(i)O(2) and PaCO(2) on day 1, ARDS of pulmonary origin, worse SOFA score, and ICU-acquired events. CONCLUSIONS: Half the patients with ARDS had major comorbidities, which were associated with severe ARDS, multiple organ dysfunction, and day-28 mortality. These findings do not support the exclusion of ARDS patients with severe comorbidities from randomized clinical trials. Trials in ARDS patients with whatever comorbidities are warranted.

6417,Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in spina bifida and (H1N1)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome,2017-09-13,"Haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo SCT) has emerged as an acceptable alternative to matched family donor transplantation for children diagnosed to have primary immune deficiency disorders (PIDs). We present data over 4 years on the challenges and efficacy of unmanipulated T cell replete haplo SCTs with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in children diagnosed to have PIDs. We performed a retrospective study in the pediatric blood and marrow transplantation unit where all children less than 18 years of age diagnosed to have PIDs and who underwent haplo SCT with PTCy from January 2014 to February 2018 were included in the study. Of the 16 transplants included in the study, 5 children were diagnosed to have Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, 3 with congenital hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, 2 each with Griscelli syndrome and Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases, and one each with Chediak-Higashi syndrome, ORAI 1 mutation immune deficiency, severe combined immune deficiency, and Hyper IgM syndrome. The source of stem cells was PBSC in 62.5% and bone marrow in 32.5%. Engraftment by day 16–21 post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was achieved in 75% transplants with 91% of these remaining in sustained complete chimerism. Acute skin and gut graft versus host disease of grade 2–3 were noted in 50% transplants and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in 43.7% transplants. One child with congenital HLH succumbed to refractory CMV, adenovirus, and BK virus infection. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was noted in 75% transplants with 2 children succumbing to the illness. Tocilizumab was successfully used early in one child. Overall mortality was found to be 37.5% with overall survival of 62.5% with a median follow-up of 23.3 months. In resource limited settings, PTCy has the potential to provide a cost-effective advantage in terms of accessibility of this curative procedure among children with PIDs.","Uppuluri, Ramya; Sivasankaran, Meena; Patel, Shivani; Swaminathan, Venkateswaran Vellaichamy; Ramanan, Kesavan Melarcode; Ravichandran, Nikila; Ramakrishnan, Balasubramaniam; Jayakumar, Indira; Vaidhyanathan, Lakshman; Raj, Revathi",J Clin Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100782/,362
7621,Optimal Ventilator Strategies in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,2019-05-06,"Inoculation of tracheal organ cultures from bovine foetuses with Mycoplasma bovis resulted in a loss of cellular structure of the lamina propria, followed 20–22 days later by lifting and detachment of overlying epithelium. The effect was associated with large numbers of M. bovis, identified by immunoperoxidase labelling and electromicroscopy, infiltrating between the epithelial cells and amassing in the lamina propria, especially in the region of the basement membrane of the epithelium. Ciliary activity was undiminished for up to 18 days following inoculation and little or no cytopathic effect on the ciliated epithelium was seen in spite of the close proximity of large numbers of organisms. In contrast, M. dispar was restricted to the margin of the ciliated epithelium where, as previously reported, it caused pyknosis, sloughing and flattening of the epithelium with consequent loss of ciliary activity. The cytopathology observed for each mycoplasma bore a close similarity to the behaviour of the two mycoplasmas in vivo and it is suggested that the organ culture system may be a useful and relevant system to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms for each mycoplasma.","Thomas, L.H.; Howard, C.J.; Parsons, K.R.; Anger, H.S.",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117133/,362
11543,"Respiratory drive in the acute respiratory distress syndrome: pathophysiology, monitoring, and therapeutic interventions",2020-02-03,"BACKGROUND: The clinical effectiveness of neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) has yet to be demonstrated, and preliminary studies are required. The study aim was to assess the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of NAVA versus pressure support ventilation (PSV) in critically ill adults at risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation (MV). METHODS: An open-label, parallel, feasibility RCT (n = 78) in four ICUs of one university-affiliated hospital. The primary outcome was mode adherence (percentage of time adherent to assigned mode), and protocol compliance (binary—≥ 65% mode adherence). Secondary exploratory outcomes included ventilator-free days (VFDs), sedation, and mortality. RESULTS: In the 72 participants who commenced weaning, median (95% CI) mode adherence was 83.1% (64.0–97.1%) and 100% (100–100%), and protocol compliance was 66.7% (50.3–80.0%) and 100% (89.0–100.0%) in the NAVA and PSV groups respectively. Secondary outcomes indicated more VFDs to D28 (median difference 3.0 days, 95% CI 0.0–11.0; p = 0.04) and fewer in-hospital deaths (relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.2–0.9; p = 0.032) for NAVA. Although overall sedation was similar, Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) scores were closer to zero in NAVA compared to PSV (p = 0.020). No significant differences were observed in duration of MV, ICU or hospital stay, or ICU, D28, and D90 mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility trial demonstrated good adherence to assigned ventilation mode and the ability to meet a priori protocol compliance criteria. Exploratory outcomes suggest some clinical benefit for NAVA compared to PSV. Clinical effectiveness trials of NAVA are potentially feasible and warranted.

16886,Effect of Ultraprotective Mechanical Ventilation on Right Ventricular Function During Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Adults With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,2020-11-05,"BACKGROUND: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC-producing Enterobacterales are common causes of bloodstream infection. ESBL-producing bacteria are typically resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and result in a sizeable economic and public health burden. AmpC-producing Enterobacterales may develop third-generation cephalosporin resistance through enzyme hyper-expression. In no observational study has the outcome of treatment of these infections been surpassed by carbapenems. Widespread use of carbapenems may drive the development of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. METHODS: This study will use a multicentre, parallel group open-label non-inferiority trial design comparing ceftolozane-tazobactam and meropenem in adult patients with bloodstream infection caused by ESBL or AmpC-producing Enterobacterales. Trial recruitment will occur in up to 40 sites in six countries (Australia, Singapore, Italy, Spain, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon). The sample size is determined by a predefined quantity of ceftolozane-tazobactam to be supplied by Merck, Sharpe and Dohme (MSD). We anticipate that a trial with 600 patients contributing to the primary outcome analysis would have 80% power to declare non-inferiority with a 5% non-inferiority margin, assuming a 30-day mortality of 5% in both randomised groups. Once randomised, definitive treatment will be for a minimum of 5 days and a maximum of 14 days with the total duration determined by treating clinicians. Data describing demographic information, risk factors, concomitant antibiotics, illness scores, microbiology, multidrug-resistant organism screening, discharge and mortality will be collected. DISCUSSION: Participants will have bloodstream infection due to third-generation cephalosporin non-susceptible E. coli and Klebsiella spp. or Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. or Serratia marcescens. They will be randomised 1:1 to ceftolozane-tazobactam 3 g versus meropenem 1 g, both every 8 h. Secondary outcomes will be a comparison of 14-day all-cause mortality, clinical and microbiological success at day 5, functional bacteraemia score, microbiological relapse, new bloodstream infection, length of hospital stay, serious adverse events, C. difficile infection, multidrug-resistant organism colonisation. The estimated trial completion date is December 2024.

Recent RCOG/BSGE recommendations have recommended retrieval of ovarian masses via the umbilical port with resultant less postoperative pain and a faster retrieval time than with retrieval through lateral ports of the same size. This is a prospective observational study reviewing the Hasson entry technique and the introduction of retrieval of specimens via the umbilicus in patients scheduled for a laparoscopy procedure at our day surgery unit. We found no immediate or major surgical complications and all specimens were successfully retrieved through the umbilicus. Pain scores were low. We recommend the technique for extirpative gynaecological surgery. Impact Statement This study confirms that conversion from the closed Veress to the open Hasson technique is achievable in a university hospital setting. Operator confidence during the learning phase is enhanced by the use of ultrasound to locate and measure the depth of the umbilical ligament. Retrieval of benign adnexal specimens through the umbilicus was very satisfactory.","Wong, L F A; Anglim, B; Wahab, N A; Gleeson, N",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.1080/01443615.2016.1269226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28421907/,362

Ophthalmic examination OS revealed a firm and smooth mass, extending from the medial canthus toward the medial orbital wall. Indirect ophthalmoscopy revealed indentation of the nasal part OS, which corresponded to the position of the orbital mass. Orbital neoplastic diseases were the main differential considerations. Computerized tomography revealed a bony smooth orbital mass without bone destructive features. Biopsy was performed, and histologic features were suggestive of osteoma. Systemic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs resulted in complete mass regression and absence of clinical signs for 5 years following initial diagnosis.

126877,The importance of detection and percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Authors' reply.,2020-06-25,"The sentinel node (SN) concept has been found to be feasible in gastric cancer. However, the lymphatic network of gastric cancer may be more complex, and it may be difficult to visualize all the SN distributed in unexpected areas by conventional modalities. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of CT lymphography for the detection of SN in gastric cancer. A total 24 patients with early gastric cancer were enrolled in the study. Three modalities (CT lymphography, dye and radioisotope [RI] methods) were used for the detection of SN. The images of CT lymphography were obtained at 10 min after injection of contrast agents. The SN were successfully identified by CT lymphography in 83.3% of patients; detection rates by the dye and RI methods were 95% and 100%, respectively. Most patients, in whom SN were successfully detected by CT lymphography, had positive results at 5 min after injection of the contrast material. The SN stations detected by CT lymphography were consistent with or included those detected by dye and/or RI methods. In conclusion, CT lymphography for the detection of SN in gastric cancer is feasible and has several advantages. However, based on this initial experience, CT lymphography had a relatively low detection rate compared with conventional methods, and further efforts will be necessary to improve the detection rate and widen the clinical application of CT lymphography for the detection of SN in gastric cancer.","Tsujimoto, Hironori; Yaguchi, Yoshihisa; Sakamoto, Naoko; Kumano, Isao; Takahata, Risa; Matsumoto, Yusuke; Yoshida, Kazumichi; Sugasawa, Hidekazu; Ono, Satoshi; Ichikura, Takashi; Yamamoto, Junji; Hase, Kazuo",Cancer science,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1349-7006.2010.01706.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20796000/,362
133698,Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: what do we know so far?,2020-06-24,"PURPOSE Our oculoplastic service piloted a new video consultation (VC) clinic in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected to determine whether specific patients are better suited to VC, and to quantify the true benefit of VC in patients that successfully attended. METHODS Data were collected prospectively on predetermined data collection forms, including consultation duration, diagnosis, management plan, and issues that arose. RESULTS 37.8% of new referrals and 60.9% of return patients were vetted as suitable for VC. Of those invited to attend, 83.4% agreed to a VC appointment. Of the patients appointed to a VC clinic, 71.7% (new)/75% (return) successfully completed VC, 14.9%/15.8% attempted a VC which ultimately failed, and 13.4%/9.2% did not attend. VC successfully prevented face-to-face consultation in 81.3% of new cases and 91.1% of returns. Ectropion, entropion and dermatochalasis (new referrals), and postoperative follow-up (return patients) were well suited to VC, while patients with ""watery eye"" (new), and lid or conjunctival lesions (return), often required face-to-face consultation. Problems (most common issues with patients connecting to the consultation, video quality, and audio quality) were encountered during 50.3% of calls, although 82.6% of attempted calls were ultimately successful. Age was not associated with the proportion of calls that were successful. CONCLUSIONS VC is a useful tool for oculoplastic patients, irrespective of age, as long as the patient's notes/referrals are carefully vetted to determine suitability. Patients with ectropion, entropion and dermatochalasis, and postoperative reviews are better suited to VC than those with ""watery eye,"" lid lesions, and conjunctival lesions.","Jamison, Aaron; Diaper, Charles; Drummond, Suzannah; Tejwani, Deepak; Gregory, Maria Elena; Cauchi, Paul; Crofts, Kevin; Chadha, Vikas",Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/iop.0000000000001852; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33237666/,362

The aim of this study is to evaluate the literature on existing strategies whereby providers use information technology to assemble FCH. METHODS A systematic search of online databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Embase) between 1980 and 2020 was performed. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed through the chi-square test (ie, Cochrane Q test) and the inconsistency statistic (I2). A random-effects analysis was used to calculate the pooled proportions and means. RESULTS The comprehensive search produced 4,005 publications. Twenty-eight studies met inclusion criteria. Twenty-seven information technology tools were evaluated. Eighteen out of 28 studies were electronic surveys administered before visits (18, 64.3%). Five studies administered tablet surveys in offices (5, 17.8%). Four studies collected electronic survey via kiosk before visits (4, 14.3%), and one study used animated virtual counselor during visits (1, 3.6%). Among the studies that use an FCH tool, the pooled estimate of the overall completion rate was 86% (CI, 72% to 96%), 84% (CI, 65% to 97%) for electronic surveys before visits, 89% (CI, 0.74 to 0.98) for tablet surveys, and 85% (CI, 0.66 to 0.98) for surveys via kiosk. Mean time required for completion was 31.0 minutes (CI, 26.1 to 35.9), and the pooled estimate of proportions of participants referred to genetic testing was 12% (CI, 4% to 23%).

However, despite the qualitative understanding that the occurrence and diffusion of infectious disease is related to the environment, the quantitative relations are unknown for many diseases. Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus that poses a fatal threat and has spread explosively throughout the world, impacting human health. From a geographical perspective, this study aims to understand the global hotspots of ZIKV as well as the spatially heterogeneous relationship between ZIKV and environmental factors using exploratory special data analysis (ESDA) model. A geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was used to analyze the influence of the dominant environmental factors on the spread of ZIKV at the continental scale. The results indicated that ZIKV transmission had obvious regional and seasonal heterogeneity. Population density, GDP per capita, and landscape fragmentation were the dominant environmental factors affecting the spread of ZIKV, which indicates that social factors had a greater influence than natural factors on the spread of it. As SARS-CoV-2 is spreading globally, this study can provide methodological reference for fighting against the pandemic.","Li, Jie; Jia, Kun; Liu, Yanxu; Yuan, Bo; Xia, Mu; Zhao, Wenwu",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,362
222802,SARS-CoV-2 versus influenza associated acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support,2020,"Purpose of review: Precision medicine (PM) represents a new paradigm in disease diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. To apply PM premises in an emerging coronavirus pandemic acquires potentially greater relevance in order to allow the selection of specific preventive measures as well as biomarkers that will be useful in disease management. Recent findings: The identification of the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had led to a plethora of strategies to contain viral dissemination, affecting life styles and personal behaviors. Viral genomic sequencing has shown that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) found on ciliated epithelial cells of the human lungs as its specific receptor. Neutralizing antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein were detected in patients recovered from COVID-19; however, both T cells and NK cells were reduced in severe cases. Excessive and uncontrolled releases of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1B, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF&#945;) were increased in severe patients. These cytokines might be useful biomarkers of disease worsening and potential targets for new biological therapies currently under investigation. Summary: Present knowledge and recent developments in PM approach to COVID-19 disease prevention, evaluation, and management are pointed out. Better understanding of pathogenic pathways together with an accurate phenotype classification of patients presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms might contribute to a more accurate definition of biomarkers and other diagnostic tools, which may lead to more precise mitigation strategies, personalized pharmacologic options, as well as new biological therapy developments.","Crisci, Carlos D; Ardusso, Ledit R F; Mossuz, Antonela; Müller, Leila",Curr Treat Options Allergy,,362

246430,Factors Associated With Pulmonary Embolism Among Coronavirus Disease 2019 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Multicenter Study Among 375 Patients,2020,"Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia are at higher risk of developing thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction. We report a case of a patient who developed a right sided ventricular thrombus despite being on therapeutic anticoagulation. A 49-year-old man with no past medical history was admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19 pneumonia. He was started on therapeutic Enoxaparin due to D-dimer of 17710ng/ml. Lower extremity duplex was negative for deep vein thrombosis. Patient was enrolled in Sarilumab trial and received the intervention on day 3 and 4 of admission. Initially patient's oxygen requirements decreased, and D-dimer levels trended down. But on day 11, patient was hypotensive, hypoxic to 84% on 5L NC. Differentials included-Pulmonary embolism, Progression of COIVD-19 pneumonia, ARDS, superimposed bacterial pneumonia. Further workup included repeat chest x-ray which showed resolving bilateral infiltrates. D-dimer was 4388ng/ml. A bedside echocardiogram showed right ventricular dilation and a large mobile echo-dense mass measuring 12mm∗11mm compatible with a Right Ventricular thrombus. CT chest revealed right lower lobe pulmonary embolus and evidence of right heart strain. Patient was transferred to the ICU. Enoxaparin was stopped, a bolus of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) 50mg was administered over 2 hours followed by a 1mg/hr infusion. Heparin drip with a PTT goal of 30-50 seconds was administered simultaneously for 24 hours. Fibrinogen levels were checked every 6 hours to ensure levels remained above 150 mg/dl. After 24 hours, echocardiogram showed persistent RV mobile thrombus and McConnell's sign. The above infusion protocol was repeated for 24 hours. After tPA infusion patient O2 requirements down trended from nonrebreather 15L to NC 5L. Repeat echo showed resolution of RV thrombus. Repeat CTPE had no new filling defects. There were no bleeding events. Patient was transitioned to apixaban and transferred stable to the floors. Patients with COVID-19 are at higher risk of developing hypercoagulability and it is associated with a worse prognosis. Bedside echocardiogram is a rapid accessible test that can be used in acute decompensating patients. Consecutive doses of tPA appear to be a safe and effective option for the treatment of right heart thrombus. Infusion endpoint for such patients include significant bleeding, drop in hemoglobin by 2 g/dl, fibrinogen &lt;150mg/dl, and/or thrombus resolution on echocardiogram. Our patient showed improvement after tPA infusion perhaps by the thrombus lysis or lysis of the microthromboemboli and fibrin deposits of the pulmonary microvasculature.","Parthasarathy, S.; Alejos, D.; Li, W.; Kakkar, A.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,362

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the knowledge, attitude, and practices of medical students in Uganda on the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an online, descriptive cross-sectional study in mid-April 2020, using WhatsApp Messenger. Medical students in 9 of the 10 medical schools in Uganda were approached through convenience sampling. Bloom's cut-off of 80% was used to determine good knowledge (&#8805;12 out of 15), positive attitude (&#8805;20 out of 25), and good practice (&#8805;12 out of 15). RESULTS: The data of 741 first- to fifth-year medical students, consisting of 468 (63%) males with a mean age of 24 (SD 4) years, were analyzed. The majority (n=626, 84%) were pursuing Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees. Overall, 671 (91%) had good knowledge, 550 (74%) had a positive attitude, and 426 (57%) had good practices. Knowledge was associated with the 4th year of study (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.1, 95% CI 1.6-10.3; P<.001). Attitude was associated with the female sex (aOR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-1; P=.04) and TV or radio shows (aOR 1.1, 95% CI 0.6-2.1; P=.01). Practices were associated with the &#8805;24 years age category (aOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1; P=.02) and online courses (aOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.2; P=.03). In total, 592 (80%) medical students were willing to participate in frontline care if called upon.

Subjects and Methods: This cross-sectional study utilized an online questionnaire consisting of 29 items and three sections. The first section collected demographic information, including age, gender, location, and level of education. The second section assessed their knowledge of clinical characteristics, treatments, and disease prevention. The third section addressed the students' behaviors. Results: Respondents included 223 students, of which 37.2% were males and 62.8% were females. The largest group of respondents included medical students (44.8%), followed by dental students (41.3%). Overall, students demonstrated a thorough knowledge of disease transmission, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19. However, some of the respondents could not identify the full name of the disease, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (64.6%), or provide a current estimate of the number of cases diagnosed globally (49.8%). Additionally, most of the survey respondents (93.3%) reported that they had followed social distancing guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health. Conclusion: While most health students were knowledgeable about most aspects of COVID-19, others did not follow universal precautions during the outbreak, which identifies better incorporation of such information in students' academic programs.","Natto, Z S; Alshaeri, H K",Niger J Clin Pract,,362

In this paper we present a spatial infection-cutting game, formally equivalent to a Hopfield neural network coupled to SIRS disease dynamics. Behavioural game parameters can be precisely calibrated to geographical time series of Covid-19 active case numbers, giving an implied spatial history of disease cutting behaviour. This is used to investigate the effects of government intervention, quantify behaviour area by area, and measure the effect of wealth on implied behaviour. We also demonstrate how a delay in people's perception of risk levels can induce behavioural instability, and oscillations in infection rates.","Burridge, James; Gnacik, Michal",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.10576v1.pdf,362
354641,[Clinical analysis and countermeasures of 739 cases treated in the emergency department of stomatology in general hospital during COVID-19 epidemic],2021,"The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines brings hope for successful pandemic mitigation and getting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under control. The vaccines authorized in Europe displayed a good safety profile in the clinical trials. However, during their post-authorization use, unusual thrombotic events associated with thrombocytopenia have rarely been reported for vector vaccines. This led to the temporary suspension of the AZD1222 vaccine (Oxford/AstraZeneca) in various European countries and the Ad26.COV2 vaccine (Janssen/Johnson&Johnson) in the United States, with regulatory bodies launching investigations into potential causal associations. The thromboembolic reactions were also rarely reported after mRNA vaccines. The exact cause of these adverse effects remains to be elucidated. The present paper outlines the hypotheses on the mechanisms behind the very rare thrombotic thrombocytopenia reported after the COVID-19 vaccination, along with currently existing evidence and future research prospects. The following are discussed: (i) the role of antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4), (ii) the direct interaction between adenoviral vector and platelets, (iii) the cross-reactivity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with PF4, (iv) cross-reactivity of anti-adenovirus antibodies and PF4, (v) interaction between spike protein and platelets, (vi) the platelet expression of spike protein and subsequent immune response, and (vii) the platelet expression of other adenoviral proteins and subsequent reactions. It is also plausible that thrombotic thrombocytopenia after the COVID-19 vaccine is multifactorial. The elucidation of the causes of these adverse events is pivotal in taking precautionary measures and managing vaccine hesitancy. It needs to be stressed, however, that the reported cases are currently sporadic and that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines vastly outweigh their potential risks.","Rzymski, P.; Perek, B.; Flisiak, R.",Vaccines (Basel),,362
356372,Bronchiolitis and Potential Pathophysiological Implications in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Patients With Near-Normal Respiratory Compliance,2020,"The devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has raised important questions about its origins and the mechanism of its transfer to humans. A further question was whether companion or commercial animals could act as SARS-CoV-2 vectors, with early data suggesting susceptibility is species specific. To better understand SARS-CoV-2 species susceptibility, we undertook an in silico structural homology modelling, protein-protein docking, and molecular dynamics simulation study of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein's ability to bind angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from relevant species. Spike protein exhibited the highest binding to human (h)ACE2 of all the species tested, forming the highest number of hydrogen bonds with hACE2. Interestingly, pangolin ACE2 showed the next highest binding affinity despite having a relatively low sequence homology, whereas the affinity of monkey ACE2 was much lower despite its high sequence similarity to hACE2. These differences highlight the power of a structural versus a sequence-based approach to cross-species analyses. ACE2 species in the upper half of the predicted affinity range (monkey, hamster, dog, ferret, cat) have been shown to be permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting a correlation between binding affinity and infection susceptibility. These findings show that the earliest known SARS-CoV-2 isolates were surprisingly well adapted to bind strongly to human ACE2, helping explain its efficient human to human respiratory transmission. This study highlights how in silico structural modelling methods can be used to rapidly generate information on novel viruses to help predict their behaviour and aid in countermeasure development.","Piplani, Sakshi; Singh, Puneet Kumar; Winkler, David A; Petrovsky, Nikolai",Sci Rep,,362

Here, we compare the clinical and molecular features of patients with long duration of viral shedding (LDs) with those from patients with short duration patients (SDs), and healthy donors (HDs). We find that several cytokines and chemokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin &#945; (LT-&#945;) are present at lower levels in LDs than SDs. Single-cell RNA sequencing shows that natural killer (NK) cells and CD14+ monocytes are reduced, while regulatory T cells are increased in LDs; moreover, T and NK cells in LDs are less activated than in SDs. Importantly, most cells in LDs show reduced expression of ribosomal protein (RP) genes and related pathways, with this inversed correlation between RP levels and infection duration further validated in 103 independent patients. Our results thus indicate that immunosuppression and low RP expression may be related to the persistence of the viral infection in COVID-19 patients.","Yang, Bin; Fan, Junpeng; Huang, Jia; Guo, Ensong; Fu, Yu; Liu, Si; Xiao, Rourou; Liu, Chen; Lu, Funian; Qin, Tianyu; He, Chao; Wang, Zizhuo; Qin, Xu; Hu, Dianxing; You, Lixin; Li, Xi; Wang, Tian; Wu, Peng; Chen, Gang; Zhou, Jianfeng; Li, Kezhen; Sun, Chaoyang",Nat Commun,,362
368944,A high blood endocan profile during COVID-19 distinguishes moderate from severe acute respiratory distress syndrome,2021,BACKGROUND: Ventilator sharing is one option to emergently increase ventilator capacity during a crisis but has been criticized for its inability to adjust for individual patient needs. Newer ventilator sharing designs use valves and restrictors to control pressures for each patient. A key component of these designs is an inline Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) Valve but these are not readily available. Creating an inline PEEP valve by converting a standard bag-valve-mask PEEP valve is possible with the addition of a 3D printed collar. METHODS: This was a feasibility study assessing the performance and safety of a method for converting a standard PEEP valve into an inline PEEP valve. A collar was designed and printed that covers the exhaust ports of the valve and returns exhaled gases to the ventilator. RESULTS: The collar piece was simple to print and easily assembled with the standard PEEP valve. In bench testing it successfully created differential pressures in 2 simulated expiratory limbs without leaking to the atmosphere at pressures greater than 60 cm of H2O. CONCLUSION: Our novel inline PEEP valve design shows promise as an option for building a safer ventilator sharing system.,"Bunting, Leonard; Roy, Steven; Pinson, Hannah; Greensweig, Tobin",Am J Emerg Med,,362
373190,Extracorporeal Oxygenation and Coronavirus Disease 2019 Epidemic: Is the Membrane Fail-Safe to Cross Contamination?,2020,"Immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies are important in dermatology, but indications are influenced by SARS-CoV-2. We will focus on skin disorders such as autoimmune connective tissue disorders, neutrophilic dermatoses, and vasculitis. Immunomodulators such as colchicine and antimalarials can easily be preferred taking their beneficial effects on COVID-19 into consideration and also given their wide spectrum of action. Among the conventional therapies, methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil increase the risk of infection, and thus their use is recommended only when necessary and at low doses. On the other hand, use of cyclosporine is also not recommended as it increases the risk of hypertension, which is susceptible to COVID-19. Anti-TNF agents from among the biological therapies appear to be slightly risky in terms of susceptibility to infection. However, there are ongoing studies which suggest that some biological treatments may reduce cytokine storm impeding the COVID-19 progression as a result, in spite of their susceptibilities to COVID-19. Patients, who will be started on immunosuppressive therapy, should be tested for COVID-19 prior to the therapy, and in the event that COVID-19 is suspected, the therapy should be discontinued.","Karadag, Ayse Serap; Aslan Kayiran, Melek; Lotti, Torello; Wollina, Uwe",Dermatol Ther,,362
378651,Coronavirus Disease 2019 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Guideline-Driven Care Should Be Our Natural Reflex,2020,"There is growing literature about the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenetic effects exerted during pregnancy and whether vertical transmission or premature birth is possible. It is not well known whether changes in the immune system of pregnant women may lead to a marked susceptibility to infectious processes and the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal complications such as preterm birth, spontaneous abortion, hospitalization in an intensive care unit, transmission to the fetus or newborns, and fetal mortality are poorly understood. Along with this ongoing debate, it is not well defined whether, during pregnancy, the role of host susceptibility in producing a specific inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 may represent distinctive markers of risk of vertical transmission. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 impact on the vaginal microbiome has not yet been described, despite mounting evidence on its possible effect on the gastrointestinal microbiome and its influence on infectious diseases and preterm labor. This report describes the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on a twin pregnancy diagnosed with infection at the third trimester of gestation including tissue infections, inflammatory response, antibody production, cytokine concentration, and vaginal microbiome composition. We identified a pattern of cytokines including IL1-Ra, IL-9 G-CSF, IL-12, and IL-8 differently expressed, already associated with previously infected patients. We detected a similar concentration of almost all the cytokines tested in both twins, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm is not substantially impaired during the placental passage. The analysis of the vaginal microbiome did not show relevant signs of dysbiosis, similar to other healthy pregnant women and twin healthy pregnancies. The aim of this report was to analyze the immunological response against SARS-CoV-2 infection and virus tissue tropism in a twin pregnancy.","Trombetta, Andrea; Comar, Manola; Tommasini, Alberto; Canton, Melania; Campisciano, Giuseppina; Zanotta, Nunzia; Cason, Carolina; Maso, Gianpaolo; Risso, Francesco Maria",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,362

Physical inactivity, alterations in dietary habits, and inability to seek guidance from the physician are some of the contributing factors. This study aims to assess the self-care practices and psychological distress during the pandemic among diabetic patients visiting the institute's out patient department. METHOD: A convenient sampling method was used to recruit subjects from a representative clinical sample using validated scales like the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) and Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). RESULT: The study enrolled a total of 108 subjects with the mean age being 56.3 years. The everyday healthy eating plan was followed by 76.85% (N = 83) subjects and daily physical activity for at least 30 min performed by 50% (54) subjects. Only 12.04% (13) subjects tested their blood sugar and 6.48% (7) respondents checked their feet daily. There was no significant difference found between the SDSCA and psychological distress based on socio-demographic variables. CONCLUSION: Participants in this study typically reported a good level of self-care behavior particularly for diet followed by exercise whereas the self-care behavior was not adequate for foot care and blood-glucose testing. People were not too anxious about COVID-19. This study highlighted the fact that people with diabetes should monitor their blood sugar levels more often along with their foot care.","Bala, Renu; Srivastava, Amit; Potsangbam, Thadoi; Anal, Lily; Ningthoujam, Gouri D",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,362
391634,The importance of detection and percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Authors' reply,2020,"HLA class I (HLA-I) glycoproteins drive immune responses by presenting antigens to cognate CD8+ T cells. This process is often hijacked by tumors and pathogens for immune evasion. Because options for restoring HLA-I antigen presentation are limited, we aimed to identify druggable HLA-I pathway targets. Using iterative genome-wide screens, we uncovered that the cell surface glycosphingolipid (GSL) repertoire determines effective HLA-I antigen presentation. We show that absence of the protease SPPL3 augmented B3GNT5 enzyme activity, resulting in upregulation of surface neolacto-series GSLs. These GSLs sterically impeded antibody and receptor interactions with HLA-I and diminished CD8+ T cell activation. Furthermore, a disturbed SPPL3-B3GNT5 pathway in glioma correlated with decreased patient survival. We show that the immunomodulatory effect could be reversed through GSL synthesis inhibition using clinically approved drugs. Overall, our study identifies a GSL signature that inhibits immune recognition and represents a potential therapeutic target in cancer, infection, and autoimmunity.","Jongsma, Marlieke L M; de Waard, Antonius A; Raaben, Matthijs; Zhang, Tao; Cabukusta, Birol; Platzer, René; Blomen, Vincent A; Xagara, Anastasia; Verkerk, Tamara; Bliss, Sophie; Kong, Xiangrui; Gerke, Carolin; Janssen, Lennert; Stickel, Elmer; Holst, Stephanie; Plomp, Rosina; Mulder, Arend; Ferrone, Soldano; Claas, Frans H J; Heemskerk, Mirjam H M; Griffioen, Marieke; Halenius, Anne; Overkleeft, Hermen; Huppa, Johannes B; Wuhrer, Manfred; Brummelkamp, Thijn R; Neefjes, Jacques; Spaapen, Robbert M",Immunity,,362

However, data on the viral loads in such individuals are lacking. We assessed the viral loads in asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection in comparison with those in symptomatic patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Study participants were recruited from a community facility designated for the isolation of patients with mild COVID-19 in South Korea. The presence of symptoms was evaluated with a questionnaire-based survey. Viral loads in the upper respiratory tract were measured with real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) targeting the E, RdRp and N genes of SARS-CoV-2, with a cycle threshold (Ct) value of 40 for determining positivity. RESULTS: In 213 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 41 (19%) had remained asymptomatic from potential exposure to laboratory confirmation and admission; of them, 39 (95%) underwent follow-up RT-PCR testing after a median 13 days. In 172 symptomatic patients, 144 (84%) underwent follow-up RT-PCR testing. Twenty-one (54%) asymptomatic individuals and 92 (64%) symptomatic patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at follow-up. Asymptomatic individuals and symptomatic patients did not show any significant differences in the mean Ct values of the E (31.15 vs 31.43; p>0.99), RdRp (32.26 vs 32.93; p=0.92) and N (33.05 vs 33.28; p>0.99) genes. CONCLUSION: Approximately one-fifth of the individuals without severe symptoms were asymptomatic, and their viral loads were comparable to those in symptomatic patients.

We estimated the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in the State of Rio de Janeiro. Methods: Data were collected on 2,857 blood donors from April 14 to 27, 2020. We report the crude prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the weighted prevalence by the total state population, and adjusted prevalence estimates for test sensitivity and specificity. To establish the correlates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, we used logistic regression models. The analysis included period and site of blood collection, sociodemographic characteristics, and place of residence. Results: The proportion of SARS-Cov-2 positive tests without any adjustment was 4.0% (95% CI 3.3-4.7%), and the weighted prevalence was 3.8% (95% CI 3.1-4.5%). Further adjustment by test sensitivity and specificity produced lower estimates, 3.6% (95% CI 2.7-4.4%) and 3.3% (95% CI 2.6-4.1%), respectively. The variable most significantly associated with the crude prevalence was the period of blood collection: the later the period, the higher the prevalence. Regarding socio-demographic characteristics, the younger the blood donors, the higher the prevalence, and the lower the educational level, the higher the odds of a positive SARS-Cov-2 antibody. Similar results were found for the weighted prevalence. Discussion: Although our findings resulted from a convenience sample, they match some basic premises: the increasing trend over time, since the epidemic curve in the state is still on the rise; the higher prevalence among the youngest who are more likely to circulate; and the higher prevalence among the less educated as they have more difficulties in following the social distancing recommendations. Despite the study limitations, it is possible to infer that protective levels of natural herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 are far from being reached in Rio de Janeiro.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to systematically examine whether there was a COVID-19 pandemic-related increase in the self-reported use of digital mental health tools and other technologies to manage mental health. METHODS: We analyzed results from a survey of 5907 individuals in the United States using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk); the survey was administered during 4 week-long periods in 2020 and survey respondents were from all 50 states and Washington DC. The first set of analyses employed two different logistic regression models to estimate the likelihood of having symptoms indicative of clinical depression and anxiety, respectively, as a function of the rate of COVID-19 cases per 10 people and survey time point. The second set employed seven different logistic regression models to estimate the likelihood of using seven different types of digital mental health tools and other technologies to manage one's mental health, as a function of symptoms indicative of clinical depression and anxiety, rate of COVID-19 cases per 10 people, and survey time point. These models also examined potential interactions between symptoms of clinical depression and anxiety, respectively, and rate of COVID-19 cases. All models controlled for respondent sociodemographic characteristics and state fixed effects. RESULTS: Higher COVID-19 case rates were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of reporting symptoms of depression (odds ratio [OR] 2.06, 95% CI 1.27-3.35), but not anxiety (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.77-1.88). Survey time point, a proxy for time, was associated with a greater likelihood of reporting clinically meaningful symptoms of depression and anxiety (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.27 and OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.19, respectively). Reported symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with a greater likelihood of using each type of technology. Higher COVID-19 case rates were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of using mental health forums, websites, or apps (OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.49-4.88), and other health forums, websites, or apps (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.55-4.34). Time was associated with increased odds of reported use of mental health forums, websites, or apps (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.11-1.30), phone-based or text-based crisis lines (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.10-1.31), and online, computer, or console gaming/video gaming (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.19).

405178,Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Coronavirus Disease 2019-Induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Multicenter Descriptive Study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Accompanying the rising rates of reported mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a reported increase in the use of digital technologies to manage health generally, and mental health more specifically. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to systematically examine whether there was a COVID-19 pandemic-related increase in the self-reported use of digital mental health tools and other technologies to manage mental health. METHODS: We analyzed results from a survey of 5907 individuals in the United States using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk); the survey was administered during 4 week-long periods in 2020 and survey respondents were from all 50 states and Washington DC. The first set of analyses employed two different logistic regression models to estimate the likelihood of having symptoms indicative of clinical depression and anxiety, respectively, as a function of the rate of COVID-19 cases per 10 people and survey time point. The second set employed seven different logistic regression models to estimate the likelihood of using seven different types of digital mental health tools and other technologies to manage one's mental health, as a function of symptoms indicative of clinical depression and anxiety, rate of COVID-19 cases per 10 people, and survey time point. These models also examined potential interactions between symptoms of clinical depression and anxiety, respectively, and rate of COVID-19 cases. All models controlled for respondent sociodemographic characteristics and state fixed effects. RESULTS: Higher COVID-19 case rates were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of reporting symptoms of depression (odds ratio [OR] 2.06, 95% CI 1.27-3.35), but not anxiety (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.77-1.88). Survey time point, a proxy for time, was associated with a greater likelihood of reporting clinically meaningful symptoms of depression and anxiety (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.27 and OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.19, respectively). Reported symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with a greater likelihood of using each type of technology. Higher COVID-19 case rates were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of using mental health forums, websites, or apps (OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.49-4.88), and other health forums, websites, or apps (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.55-4.34). Time was associated with increased odds of reported use of mental health forums, websites, or apps (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.11-1.30), phone-based or text-based crisis lines (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.10-1.31), and online, computer, or console gaming/video gaming (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.19). Interactions between COVID-19 case rate and mental health symptoms were not significantly associated with any of the technology types. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggested increased use of digital mental health tools and other technologies over time during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, additional effort is urgently needed to consider the quality of these products, either by ensuring users have access to evidence-based and evidence-informed technologies and/or by providing them with the skills to make informed decisions around their potential efficacy.","Sorkin, Dara H; Janio, Emily A; Eikey, Elizabeth V; Schneider, Margaret; Davis, Katelyn; Schueller, Stephen M; Stadnick, Nicole A; Zheng, Kai; Neary, Martha; Safani, David; Mukamel, Dana B",J Med Internet Res,,362
420563,Do Our Sedation Practices Contribute to Increased Mortality in Coronavirus Disease 2019-Related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome?,2021,"This study investigated child protection decision-making practices of healthcare-professionals in community-health-services. We examined the effect of heuristics in professional judgments regarding suspected maltreatment, as affected by the child's ethnicity, gender, and family socioeconomic-status, as well as the healthcare-worker's workload-stress, and personal and professional background. Furthermore, we examined how these variables influence judgments regarding suspected maltreatment and intentions to consult and report child-maltreatment. We used an experimental survey design including vignettes manipulating the child's characteristics. Data was collected from 412 professionals employed at various community-health-service-clinics of the largest health-management organization in northern Israel. Findings show that all subjective factors have a significant effect on suspected child-maltreatment assessment, which appears as a significant predictor of later decisions regarding consultation and reporting. This study lends support to prior research indicating that healthcare-professionals' decisions may incorporate biases, and suggests how the effects of these biases' are mediated through a sequence of decisions. Recommendations focus on providing regular consultation opportunities for practitioners.","Enosh, Guy; Alfandari, Ravit; Nouman, Hani; Dolev, Lilach; Dascal-Weichhendler, Hagit",Child Maltreat,,362

But it is not the first time this infectious viral disease has appeared, in 2002 SARS-CoV infected more than 8000 individuals of which 9.6% patients died and in 2012 approximately 35% of MERS-CoV infected patients have died. Literature reports indicate that a chymotripsin-like cystein protease (3CLpro) is responsible for the replication of the virus inside the host cell. Therefore, design and synthesis of 3CLpro inhibitor molecules play a great impact in drug development against this COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we are discussing the anti-SARS effect of some small molecule 3CLpro inhibitors with their various binding modes of interactions to the target protein.","Konwar, Manashjyoti; Sarma, Diganta",Tetrahedron,,362

Various ways of dealing with this world crisis have been proposed from many aspects, with fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis being a method that can be applied to a wide range of emergency systems and professional groups, aiming to confront several associated issues and challenges. The purpose of this critical review was to discuss the basic principles, present current applications during the first pandemic wave, and propose future implications of this methodology. For this purpose, both primary sources, such as scientific articles, and secondary ones, such as bibliographic indexes, web pages, and databases, were used. The main search engines were PubMed, SciELO, and Google Scholar. The method was a systematic literature review of the available literature regarding the performance of the fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis of emergency systems in the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this study highlight the importance of the fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis method as a beneficial tool for healthcare workers and first responders' emergency professionals to face this pandemic as well as to manage the created uncertainty and its related risks.","Clemente-Suárez, Vicente Javier; Navarro-Jiménez, Eduardo; Ruisoto, Pablo; Dalamitros, Athanasios A; Beltran-Velasco, Ana Isabel; Hormeño-Holgado, Alberto; Laborde-Cárdenas, Carmen Cecilia; Tornero-Aguilera, Jose Francisco",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,362

The pandemic is seen to have caused transitions in people’s construing, experienced, for example, as anxiety, threat, guilt, and shame; and strategies to cope with it have included constriction and hostility. The reactions both of individuals and of governments differ, reflecting the individuality of construing, and can be usefully viewed in terms of personal construct perspectives on choice and decision-making. Losses resulting from the pandemic may be dealt with by a process of meaning reconstruction, and alternative constructions of it may usefully include consideration of positive changes that it has brought about, including reevaluation of the superordinate constructs of individuals and societies.","Winter, David A.; Reed, Nick",J.

METHODS: We analyzed data from monthly suicide statistics between January 2017 and October 2020 and from online surveys on mental health filled out by the general population in Japan. RESULTS: Compared to the 2017-19 period, the number of suicide deaths during the initial phase of the pandemic was lower than average but exceeded the past trend from July 2020. Female suicides, whose numbers increased by approximately 70% in October 2020 (incidence rate ratio: 1.695, 95% confidence interval: 1.558-1.843), were the main source of this increase. The largest increase was found among young women (less than 40 years of age). Our survey data indicated that the status of young women's mental health has been deteriorating in recent months and that young female workers were more likely to have experienced a job or income loss than any other group, suggesting adverse economic conditions surrounding them. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous monitoring of mental health, particularly that of the most vulnerable populations identified in this study, and appropriate suicide prevention efforts are necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ueda, Michiko; Nordström, Robert; Matsubayashi, Tetsuya",J. public health (Oxf),,362

DESIGN: Observational study employing data on confirmed COVID‐19 cases and deaths in ALs from seven states, through May 29, 2020. SETTING: Information on COVID‐19 cases/deaths in ALs was obtained from state government websites. A national inventory of ALs was used to identify communities with and without COVID‐19 cases/deaths. Medicare Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF) identifying AL residents was employed to develop AL characteristics. County‐level COVID‐19 lab‐confirmed cases/deaths were obtained from publicly available data. PARTICIPANTS: We found 4,865 ALs (2,647 COVID‐19 cases and 777 deaths) in the 7 states. After excluding missing data the sample consisted of 3,994 ALs (82.1%) with 2,542 cases (96.0%) and 675 deaths (86.9%). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes were AL‐level counts of cases and deaths. Covariates were AL characteristics and county‐level confirmed COVID‐19 cases/deaths. Multivariable 2‐part models determined the associations of independent variables with the likelihood of at least one case and death in the AL, and with the count of cases (deaths). RESULTS: State case fatality ranged from 3.32% in North Carolina to 9.26% in Connecticut, but for ALs in these states it was 12.89% and 31.59%, respectively. Among ALs with at least 1 case, mid‐size communities had fewer cases (IRR=0.829; p=0.004), than very small ALs. ALs with higher proportions of racial/ethnic minorities had more COVID‐19 cases (IRR=1.08; p<0.001), as did communities with higher proportions of residents with dementia, COPD and obesity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: ALs with a higher proportion of minorities had more COVID‐19 cases. Many of the previously identified individual risk factors are also present in this vulnerable population. The impact of COVID‐19 on ALs is as critical as that on nursing homes, and is worth equal attention from policy makers.","Temkin‐Greener, Helena; Guo, Wenhan; Mao, Yunjiao; Cai, Xueya; Li, Yue",J Am Geriatr Soc,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.16850; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32955107/,362

This study was conducted to assess the performance of 10 antigen-based rapid assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Methods: We analyzed 231 nasopharyngeal samples collected from October 2020-December 2020, from suspected COVID-19 cases and contacts of positive cases at Biotechnology Research Center laboratories, Tripoli, Libya. The performance of 10 COVID-19 Ag rapid test devices (Fluorecare, ESPLINE, RapiGen, Abbott Panbio, Flowflex, Acon, Assut Europe, Orient Gene, CerTest, Bioperfectus, AMP) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen was compared to RT-qPCR. Results: Among the 108 positive samples detected by RT-qPCR, the COVID-19 antigen (Ag) tests detected 83, giving a sensitivity of 76.85% (95% CI, 67.75- 84.43). 161 patients were symptomatic. The median cycle threshold was 25. The mean duration from symptom onset was 6.6 plus/minus 4.3 days. Sensitivity and specificity during the first 6 days of symptoms and in samples with high viral loads ct<25, was 96.4%. No false positives were detected by any of the Ag tests utilized in this study. False negative samples had a median Ct of 34 and average duration of onset of symptoms of 11.3 days (range=5-20). Conclusions: Rapid antigen test diagnosis has high sensitivity and specificity in early disease when patients present less than 7 days of symptom onset. Patients are encouraged to test as soon as they get COVID-19 related symptoms within 1 week and to seek medical advice within 24 hrs. if they develop disturbed smell/taste.

684127,Using Bayesian Methods to Augment the Interpretation of Critical Care Trials. An Overview of Theory and Example Reanalysis of the Alveolar Recruitment for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Trial,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women may be especially susceptible to negative events (i.e. adversity) related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and negative affective responses to these events (i.e. stress). We examined the latent structure of stress and adversity related to the COVID-19 pandemic among pregnant women, potential antecedents of COVID-19-related stress and adversity in this population, and associations with prenatal depressive symptoms. METHOD: We surveyed 725 pregnant women residing in the San Francisco Bay Area in March−May 2020, 343 of whom provided addresses that were geocoded and matched by census tract to measures of community-level risk. We compared their self-reported depressive symptoms to women matched on demographic factors and history of mental health difficulties who were pregnant prior to the pandemic. RESULTS: Women who were pregnant during the pandemic were nearly twice as likely to have possible depression than were matched women who were pregnant prior to the pandemic. Individual- and community-level factors tied to socioeconomic inequality were associated with latent factors of COVID-19-related stress and adversity. Beyond objective adversity, subjective stress responses were strongly associated with depressive symptoms during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Highlighting the role of subjective responses in vulnerability to prenatal depression and factors that influence susceptibility to COVID-19-related stress, these findings inform the allocation of resources to support recovery from this pandemic and future disease outbreaks. In addition to policies that mitigate disruptions to the environment due to the pandemic, treatments that focus on cognitions about the self and the environment may help to alleviate depressive symptoms in pregnant women.","King, Lucy S.; Feddoes, Daisy E.; Kirshenbaum, Jaclyn S.; Humphreys, Kathryn L.; Gotlib, Ian H.",Psychological medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33781354/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s003329172100132x,362
