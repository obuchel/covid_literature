1595,Procalcitonin guidance for reduction of antibiotic use in patients hospitalized with severe acute exacerbations of asthma: a randomized controlled study with 12-month follow-up,2014-09-05,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with severe acute exacerbations of asthma often receive inappropriate antibiotic treatment. We aimed to determine whether serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels can effectively and safely reduce antibiotic exposure in patients experiencing exacerbations of asthma. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, a total of 216 patients requiring hospitalization for severe acute exacerbations of asthma were screened for eligibility to participate and 169 completed the 12-month follow-up visit. Patients were randomized to either PCT-guided (PCT group) or standard (control group) antimicrobial therapy. In the control group, patients received antibiotics according to the attending physician’s discretion; in the PCT group, patients received antibiotics according to an algorithm based on serum PCT levels. The primary end point was antibiotic exposure; secondary end points were clinical recovery, length of hospital stay, clinical and laboratory parameters, spirometry, number of asthma exacerbations, emergency room visits, hospitalizations and need for corticosteroid use due to asthma. RESULTS: PCT guidance reduced antibiotic prescription (48.9% versus 87.8%, respectively; P < 0.001) and antibiotic exposure (relative risk, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.70; P < 0.001) compared to standard therapy. There were no significant differences in clinical recovery, length of hospital stay or clinical, laboratory and spirometry outcomes in both groups. Number of asthma exacerbations, emergency room visits, hospitalizations and need for corticosteroid use due to asthma were similar during the 12-month follow-up period. CONCLUSION: A PCT-guided strategy allows antibiotic exposure to be reduced in patients with severe acute exacerbation of asthma without apparent harm.

4678,The 24-Form Tai Chi Improves Anxiety and Depression and Upregulates miR-17-92 in Coronary Heart Disease Patients After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention,2020-03-11,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) occur frequently in intensive care units (NICUs). The aim of this study was to analyze the results of surveillance of HAIs in a III level NICU in Naples, Italy during 2013–2017 and to compare with those obtained during 2006–2010. METHODS: The surveillance included 1265 neonates of all birth weight (BW) classes with > 2 days NICU stay. Infections were defined using standard Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions adapted to neonatal pathology. RESULTS: A total of 125 HAIs were registered during 2013–2017 with a frequency of 9.9% and an incidence density of 3.2 per 1000 patient days. HAIs occurred in all BW classes with a decreasing trend from the lowest to the highest BW classes (p = < 0.001). Central line-associated blood stream infection (CLABSI) was the most frequent infection (69.6%), followed by ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) (20%), urinary tract infection (UTI) (8.8%) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (1.6%). Also, CLABSI and VAP incidence density decreased from lower to highest BW classes showing a significant trend (p = 0.007). Most frequent pathogens responsible for CLABSI were: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) (25.3%), Candida parapsilosis (21.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7), Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.8%). No microbiological diagnosis was achieved for 20.7% of CLABSI. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (20%), and CONS (20%) were the most frequent pathogens responsible for VAP. CLABSI incidence density showed no differences between 2006 and 2010 and 2013–2017, while VAP incidence density for the 751–100 g BW class was higher during 2006–2010 than during 2013–2017 (p = 0.006). A higher incidence of the CLABSI caused by Gram positive bacteria (p = 0.002) or by undetermined etiology (p = 0.01) was observed during 2013–2017 than during 2006–2010, while a significant lower incidence of VAP caused by Gram-negative bacteria was found during 2013–2017 than during 2006–2010 (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: HAIs in the NICU developed in all BW classes with a decreasing trend from the lowest to the highest BW classes in both study periods. Differences in the aetiology of CLABSI and VAP were found between the two study periods. This reinforces the importance of HAIs surveillance protocol in the NICU, which monitors microbiological isolates and use of medical devices for all BW classes of neonates.","Scamardo, Marina Silvia; Dolce, Pasquale; Esposito, Eliana Pia; Raimondi, Francesco; Triassi, Maria; Zarrilli, Raffaele",Ital J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079437/,311
5995,Assisted respiration using CPAP via face-mask in patients with blunt chest trauma. An alternative to intubation and mechanical ventilation: Eine Alternative zur Intubation,1998-07-01,"BACKGROUND: Due to the change of HIV disease from an acute life-threatening disease to a chronic infection, it is more psychosocial rather than therapeutic aspects that have become of interest in scientific investigations. The purpose of this exploratory study was to evaluate emotional distress, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and cognitive performance. The diagnosis of HIV was considered a life event that may lead to post-traumatic stress syndrome. METHOD: We recruited 37 HIV-positive outpatients and assessed the frequency of depressive (BDI) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) due to the diagnosis of HIV (IES), HRQoL (SF-36) and cognitive performance (SKT). Further, the new diagnostic concept of adjustment disorder as a stress response syndrome according to Maercker was considered. RESULTS: Of the 37 Patients, 67.6% (n=25) of the sample had a post-traumatic stress syndrome. The HIV-related PTSS was considered adjustment disorder using the concept proposed by Maercker. Fourteen patients (37.8%) suffered from a depressive syndrome, and 27% (n=10) showed cognitive deficits (minimal: n=8; mild: n=1; moderate: n =1). HIV-positive patients with PTSS had significantly unfavourable values in the SF-36 domains general health (p=0.003), vitality (p=0.007), social functioning (p=0.000), role-emotional (p=0.016) and mental health (p=0.000). CONCLUSION: HIV-infected patients may face a major risk of HIV-related PTSS in the sense of adjustment disorder according to Maercker, depression and cognitive dysfunction. The presence of emotional distress is associated with impairments in quality of life. We therefore suggest an early and comprehensive bio-psycho-social assessment and therapy of HIV-infected patients.","Baumschlager, D.; Haas-Krammer, A.; Rothenhäusler, H.-B.",Nervenarzt,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095816/,311

Prior studies have uncovered macroecological drivers of viral sharing, but analyses have never attempted to predict viral sharing in a pan-mammalian context. Using a conservative modelling framework, we confirm that host phylogenetic similarity and geographic range overlap are strong, nonlinear predictors of viral sharing among species across the entire mammal class. Using these traits, we predict global viral sharing patterns of 4196 mammal species and show that our simulated network successfully predicts viral sharing and reservoir host status using internal validation and an external dataset. We predict high rates of mammalian viral sharing in the tropics, particularly among rodents and bats, and within- and between-order sharing differed geographically and taxonomically. Our results emphasize the importance of ecological and phylogenetic factors in shaping mammalian viral communities, and provide a robust, general model to predict viral host range and guide pathogen surveillance and conservation efforts.","Albery, Gregory F.; Eskew, Evan A.; Ross, Noam; Olival, Kevin J.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7210981/,311
11079,Validity and reliability of pocket-sized ultrasound devices in measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter in ICU patients,2019-07-05,"Enteric viruses, generally found in sewage, are recognized as the main cause of waterborne and foodborne public health outbreaks. Among leading enteric viruses, the Rotavirus A (RVA) detection in wastewater appeared to be a novel approach to monitor the emergence of these viruses in some countries where the viral gastroenteritis surveillance is almost absent such as in Tunisia. The RVA detection and quantification in an industrial sewage purification plant of Charguia I (Tunis, Tunisia) were achieved to evaluate the performance of activated sludge procedures coupled to a macrofiltration monolamp ultraviolet irradiation type C (UV-C(254)) disinfection reactor. This UV-C(254) system was preceded by a fiberglass cartridge filter system with an average porosity of 45 μm to clarify the water and thus increase its UV transmittance. A total of 140 composite sewage samples was collected from this line of treatment and analyzed for RVA detection. The detection and the viral load quantification of RVA were performed using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The virological results showed in general that RVA were detected at high frequency of 98% (137/140). In fact, the RVA detection rates at the exit of the two studied wastewater treatment were about 100% at the exit of the activated sludge procedure. It means that all wastewater sampled at this last step of treatment was positive for RVA detection. On the other hand, 92.5% of the wastewater samples taken at the exit of the monolamp UV-C(254) reactor were positive for the RVA. However, the RVA quantification results expressed as viral load showed a significant reduction in the means of RVA viral loads at the exit of the biological activated sludge procedure and the tertiary UV-C(254) treatment, showing in general an improved treated wastewater virological quality. Therefore, the RVA load removal rates recorded at the two successive stages of treatment, the activated sludge and the UV-C(254) treatment, were around 85% and 73%, respectively, as compared to the one with 100% registered for the raw wastewater. In addition, good physical-chemical and bacteriological qualities of the treated sewage were found at the exit of the two considered wastewater treatment procedures. The present investigation represents the first Tunisian environmental report showing the good effectiveness and performance of the biological and the tertiary treatments for RVA removal. Therefore, an improved and an optimized tertiary disinfection treatment was needed since it could be a good means for getting better viral water quality and for minimizing the transmission and dissemination of human infectious viral diseases.","Ibrahim, Chourouk; Hammami, Salah; Pothier, Pierre; Khelifi, Nesserine; Hassen, Abdennaceur",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223008/,311
11255,The role of vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy in the management of FOURNIER’S gangrene: a retrospective multi-institutional cohort study,2020-03-31,"To determine the effect of various PEEP levels on electrical impedance tomography (EIT) measured differences in regional ventilation, hemodynamics, lung mechanics and parameters of alveolar gas exchange. Thirty three patients scheduled for elective urologic surgery in general anesthesia in lateral decubitus position were randomized into three groups—PEEP 0, 5 and 10 mbar. EIT recording, arterial blood gas analysis and hemodynamic parameters were captured at three timepoints—before induction (T0), 5 min after lateral positioning (T1) and 90 min after positioning (T2). Dynamic compliance (Cdyn) was measured at T1 and T2. Offline EIT data analysis was performed to calculate EIT derived parameters of ventilation distribution. Patients ventilated with PEEP of 10 mbar had a significantly lower A-a (alveolo arterial) gradient over measurements and symmetrical distribution of ventilation measured by EIT. There was no significant difference in Cdyn, center of ventilation indices and inhomogeneity index between groups. There was no difference of mean arterial pressure, cardiac index and heart rate between groups. Patients with 5 mbar of PEEP had higher stroke volume index compared to 0 and 10 mbar at baseline and over measurements. Nondependent/dependent TV ratio as well as global inhomogeneity index were correlated with A-a gradient. Dynamic compliance showed no correlation to A-a gradient. In our study, a PEEP level of 10 mbar improved alveolar gas exchange without compromising hemodynamic stability in patients mechanically ventilated in the lateral decubitus position. EIT measured parameters may be used to determine optimal ventilation parameters in these patients with inhomogeneous lung mechanics. Further studies are needed in patients with various lung pathologies.","Šribar, Andrej; Merc, Vlasta; Peršec, Zoran; Peršec, Jasminka; Milas, Ivan; Husedžinović, Sanja",J Clin Monit Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223527/,311

11387,The value of a superior vena cava collapsibility index measured with a miniaturized transoesophageal monoplane continuous echocardiography probe to predict fluid responsiveness compared to stroke volume variations in open major vascular surgery: a prospective cohort study,2019-07-05,"PURPOSE: Oncologists cope with unique work characteristics that increase their risk of developing compassion fatigue—that is, burnout and secondary traumatic stress—and can result in reduced capacity and interest in being empathetic to the suffering of others (Stamm B. The concise ProQOL manual, 2010). At the same time, oncologists can experience compassion satisfaction—that is, the positive aspects of caring. This study explored the associations of compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction with oncologists’ grief and sense of failure beyond their reported exposure to suffering and death. METHODS: Seventy-four oncologists completed self-administered questionnaires examining compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, grief, exposure to suffering and death, and sense of failure. RESULTS: The oncologists reported that they face the loss of approximately 50% of their patients, and that their patients suffer from profound emotional and physical pain. High levels of compassion fatigue and grief, and moderate levels of sense of failure, were reported. Findings showed a lack of association between exposure to suffering and death and compassion fatigue and satisfaction. However, grief and sense of failure were found to predict both aspects of compassion fatigue: secondary traumatic stress (p < 0.001, p < 0.003, respectively) and burnout (p < 0.002, p < 0.025, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the importance of the oncologists’ subjective experiences of grief and sense of failure, beyond their reports of exposure to suffering and death, in terms of their levels of compassion fatigue. Implications of these findings include the need to develop interventions for oncologists that will allow them to acknowledge, process, and overcome negative experiences of failure and grief.","Laor-Maayany, Rony; Goldzweig, Gil; Hasson-Ohayon, Ilanit; Bar-Sela, Gil; Engler-Gross, Adi; Braun, Michal",Support Care Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223813/,311
11440,"Incidence, Risk Factors, and Outcomes of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia in Traumatic Brain Injury: A Meta-analysis",2019-07-12,"BACKGROUND: COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the US, and COPD exacerbations result in approximately 700,000 hospitalizations annually. Patients with acute respiratory failure due to severe COPD exacerbation are treated with invasive (IMV) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV). Although IMV reverses hypercapnia/hypoxia, it causes significant morbidity and mortality. There is strong evidence that patients treated with NIV have better outcomes, and NIV is recommended as first line therapy in these patients. Yet, several studies have demonstrated substantial variation in the use of NIV across hospitals, leading to preventable morbidity and mortality. Through a series of mixed-methods studies, we have found that successful implementation of NIV requires physicians, respiratory therapists (RTs), and nurses to communicate and collaborate effectively, suggesting that efforts to increase the use of NIV in COPD need to account for the complex and interdisciplinary nature of NIV delivery and the need for team coordination. Therefore, we propose to compare two educational strategies: online education (OLE) and interprofessional education (IPE) which targets complex team-based care in NIV delivery. METHODS AND DESIGN: Twenty hospitals with low baseline rates of NIV use will be randomized to either the OLE or IPE study arm. The primary outcome of the trial is change in the hospital rate of NIV use among patients with COPD requiring ventilatory support. In aim 1, we will compare the uptake change over time of NIV use among patients with COPD in hospitals enrolled in the two arms. In aim 2, we will explore mediators’ role (respiratory therapist autonomy and team functionality) on the relationship between the implementation strategies and implementation effectiveness. Finally, in aim 3, through interviews with providers, we will assess acceptability and feasibility of the educational training. DISCUSSIONS: This study will be among the first to carefully test the impact of IPE in the inpatient setting. This work promises to change practice by offering approaches to facilitate greater uptake of NIV and may generalize to other interventions directed to seriously-ill patients.

11477,Respiratory and Blood Stream Infections are Associated with Subsequent Venous Thromboembolism After Primary Intracerebral Hemorrhage,2020-05-08,"PURPOSE: Exposure to end-of-life and chronic illness on a daily basis may put palliative healthcare professionals’ well-being at risk. Resilience may represent a protective factor against stressful and demanding challenges. Therefore, the aim is to systematically review the quantitative studies on resilience in healthcare professionals providing palliative care to adult patients. METHODS: A literature search on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases was performed. The review process has followed the international PRISMA statement guidelines. RESULTS: At the initial search, a total of 381 records were identified. Twelve articles were assessed for eligibility and, finally, 6 studies met all the inclusion criteria. Of these, four researches were observational and two interventional pilot studies. From the systematic synthesis, palliative care providers’ resilience revealed to be related to other psychological constructs, including secondary traumatic stress, vicarious posttraumatic growth, death anxiety, burnout, compassion satisfaction, hope and perspective taking. CONCLUSIONS: The current systematic review reported informative data leading to consider resilience as a process modulator and facilitator among palliative care professionals. A model on palliative healthcare providers’ experience and the role of resilience was proposed. Further studies may lead to its validation and implementation in assessment and intervention contributing to foster palliative healthcare professionals’ well-being.","Zanatta, Francesco; Maffoni, Marina; Giardini, Anna",Support Care Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223999/,311
11534,Preoperative miRNA-208a as a Predictor of Postoperative Complications in Children with Congenital Heart Disease Undergoing Heart Surgery,2019-11-15,"BACKGROUND: Limiting tidal volume (V(T)), plateau pressure, and driving pressure is essential during the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but may be challenging when brain injury coexists due to the risk of hypercapnia. Because lowering dead space enhances CO(2) clearance, we conducted a study to determine whether and to what extent replacing heat and moisture exchangers (HME) with heated humidifiers (HH) facilitate safe V(T) lowering in brain-injured patients with ARDS. METHODS: Brain-injured patients (head trauma or spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage with Glasgow Coma Scale at admission < 9) with mild and moderate ARDS received three ventilatory strategies in a sequential order during continuous paralysis: (1) HME with V(T) to obtain a PaCO(2) within 30–35 mmHg (HME1); (2) HH with V(T) titrated to obtain the same PaCO(2) (HH); and (3) HME1 settings resumed (HME2). Arterial blood gases, static and quasi-static respiratory mechanics, alveolar recruitment by multiple pressure–volume curves, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, mean arterial pressure, and mean flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery by transcranial Doppler were recorded. Dead space was measured and partitioned by volumetric capnography. RESULTS: Eighteen brain-injured patients were studied: 7 (39%) had mild and 11 (61%) had moderate ARDS. At inclusion, median [interquartile range] PaO(2)/FiO(2) was 173 [146–213] and median PEEP was 8 cmH(2)O [5–9]. HH allowed to reduce V(T) by 120 ml [95% CI: 98–144], V(T)/kg predicted body weight by 1.8 ml/kg [95% CI: 1.5–2.1], plateau pressure and driving pressure by 3.7 cmH(2)O [2.9–4.3], without affecting PaCO(2), alveolar recruitment, and oxygenation. This was permitted by lower airway (− 84 ml [95% CI: − 79 to − 89]) and total dead space (− 86 ml [95% CI: − 73 to − 98]). Sixteen patients (89%) showed driving pressure equal or lower than 14 cmH(2)O while on HH, as compared to 7 (39%) and 8 (44%) during HME1 and HME2 (p < 0.001). No changes in mean arterial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, intracranial pressure, and middle cerebral artery mean flow velocity were documented during HH. CONCLUSION: The dead space reduction provided by HH allows to safely reduce V(T) without modifying PaCO(2) nor cerebral perfusion. This permits to provide a wider proportion of brain-injured ARDS patients with less injurious ventilation.","Pitoni, Sara; D’Arrigo, Sonia; Grieco, Domenico Luca; Idone, Francesco Antonio; Santantonio, Maria Teresa; Di Giannatale, Pierluigi; Ferrieri, Alessandro; Natalini, Daniele; Eleuteri, Davide; Jonson, Bjorn; Antonelli, Massimo; Maggiore, Salvatore Maurizio",Neurocrit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7224122/,311

A cross-sectional online survey examined the experiences of people living with BD-I with a history of recent AP use. METHODS: Adults with self-reported physician-diagnosed BD-I (N = 200) who received oral APs during the prior year completed a survey on AP-related experiences, including side effects and their perceived burden on social functioning, adherence, and work. Items also assessed preferences for trade-offs (balancing symptom management and side effects) when considering a hypothetical new AP. The perceived impact of specific, prevalent side effects on adherence, work, and preferences for a hypothetical AP were also examined. Analyses were descriptive. RESULTS: The survey sample had a mean age of 43.2 (SD = 12.4) years, was 60% female, and 31% nonwhite. Almost all participants (98%) had experienced AP side effects. Common self-reported side effects were feeling drowsy or tired (83%), lack of emotion (79%), anxiety (79%), dry mouth (76%), and weight gain (76%). Weight gain was cited as the most bothersome side effect, rated by most participants (68%) as “very” or “extremely bothersome.” Nearly half of participants (49%) reported that AP side effects negatively impacted their job performance; almost all (92%) reported that side effects – most commonly anxiety and lack of emotion – negatively impacted social relationships (e.g., family or romantic partners). The most commonly-reported reason for stopping AP use was dislike of side effects (48%). Side effects most likely to lead to stopping or taking less of AP treatment included “feeling like a ‘zombie’” (29%), feeling drowsy or tired (25%), and weight gain (24%). When considering a hypothetical new AP, the most common side effects participants wanted to avoid included AP-induced anxiety (50%), weight gain (48%), and “feeling like a ‘zombie’” (47%).

12119,Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Supported with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation. Lost in Translational Research?,2020-08-01,"“Rhizomania” of sugar beet is a soilborne disease complex comprised of beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) and its plasmodiophorid vector, Polymyxa betae. Although BNYVV is considered the causal agent of rhizomania, additional viruses frequently accompany BNYVV in diseased roots. In an effort to better understand the virus cohort present in sugar beet roots exhibiting rhizomania disease symptoms, five independent RNA samples prepared from diseased beet seedlings reared in a greenhouse or from field-grown adult sugar beet plants and enriched for virus particles were subjected to RNAseq. In all but a healthy control sample, the technique was successful at identifying BNYVV and provided sequence reads of sufficient quantity and overlap to assemble > 98% of the published genome of the virus. Utilizing the derived consensus sequence of BNYVV, infectious RNA was produced from cDNA clones of RNAs 1 and 2. The approach also enabled the detection of beet soilborne mosaic virus (BSBMV), beet soilborne virus (BSBV), beet black scorch virus (BBSV), and beet virus Q (BVQ), with near-complete genome assembly afforded to BSBMV and BBSV. In one field sample, a novel virus sequence of 3682 nt was assembled with significant sequence similarity and open reading frame (ORF) organization to members within the subgenus Alphanecrovirus (genus Necrovirus; family Tombusviridae). Construction of a DNA clone based on this sequence led to the production of the novel RNA genome in vitro that was capable of inducing local lesion formation on leaves of Chenopodium quinoa. Additionally, two previously unreported satellite viruses were revealed in the study; one possessing weak similarity to satellite maize white line mosaic virus and a second possessing moderate similarity to satellite tobacco necrosis virus C. Taken together, the approach provides an efficient pipeline to characterize variation in the BNYVV genome and to document the presence of other viruses potentially associated with disease severity or the ability to overcome resistance genes used for sugar beet rhizomania disease management.","Weiland, John J.; Sharma Poudel, Roshan; Flobinus, Alyssa; Cook, David E.; Secor, Gary A.; Bolton, Melvin D.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354460/,311

Through these methods, analysis and visualization of health data can be more focused and target-group specific. The application in health monitoring is possible mostly due to broader technical possibilities and more available datasets. In this article, we show which geographic aspects are adapted in health monitoring at different levels (federal, state, municipality). For example, at the federal level, surveillance methods are used; at the state level health atlases are created; and on the municipality level geographic analyses are performed for possible public health interventions. Methods range from simple maps on different levels of aggregation to more complex methods like space-temporal visualization or spatial-smoothing methods. While the technical possibilities are in place, a broader implementation of geographic methods is mostly hindered by missing data access to small-area information and data protection policies. Better access to data could especially improve the possibility for geographic methods in health monitoring and could inform the population and decision makers to inform and improve population health or healthcare.","Koller, Daniela; Wohlrab, Doris; Sedlmeir, Georg; Augustin, Jobst",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7453702/,311

A total of 162 subjects were recruited for this study from a specialized olfactory dysfunction clinic and placed into one of three groups: anosmia, hyposmia or normosmia. Swabs from the nasal middle meatus were collected from each subject then processed for bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. No overall differences in bacterial diversity or composition were observed between the three cohorts in this study. However, the relative abundances of Corynebacterium spp. and Streptococcus spp. were significantly (p < 0.05) different in subjects with olfactory loss. Furthermore, subjects with deficiencies in discriminating between smells (based on discrimination scores) had a lower bacterial diversity (Simpson’s evenness p < 0.05). While these results are preliminary in nature, potential bacterial biomarkers for olfactory loss were identified.

15540,Compatibility and Safety Implications Associated with Interfacing Medical Devices in Neonatal Respiratory Care: A Case Example Using the Inhaled Nitric Oxide Delivery System,2021-02-17,"Several studies demonstrated an increase in time spent within target range when automated oxygen control (AOC) is used. However the effect on clinical outcome remains unclear. We compared clinical outcomes of preterm infants born before and after implementation of AOC as standard of care. In a retrospective pre-post implementation cohort study of outcomes for infants of 24–29 weeks gestational age receiving respiratory support before (2012–2015) and after (2015–2018) implementation of AOC as standard of care were compared. Outcomes of interest were mortality and complications of prematurity, number of ventilation days, and length of stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). A total of 588 infants were included (293 pre- vs 295 in the post-implementation cohort), with similar gestational age (27.8 weeks pre- vs 27.6 weeks post-implementation), birth weight (1033 grams vs 1035 grams) and other baseline characteristics. Mortality and rate of prematurity complications were not different between the groups. Length of stay in NICU was not different, but duration of invasive ventilation was shorter in infants who received AOC (6.4 ± 10.1 vs 4.7 ± 8.3, p = 0.029). Conclusion: In this pre-post comparison, the implementation of AOC did not lead to a change in mortality or morbidity during admission.","Salverda, H. H.; Oldenburger, N. J.; Rijken, M.; Pauws, S.

15543,"Letter by Ozair et al Regarding Article, “The Upcoming Epidemic of Heart Failure in South Asia”",2021-02-01,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) affects individuals and families from all backgrounds, regardless of their ethnicity, socio-economic status, sexual orientation, or religion. Pregnancy and childbirth could be a time of vulnerability to violence because of changes in physical, emotional, social, and economic demands and needs. Prevalence of IPV against women during the perinatal period is increasingly researched and documented. However, evidence on IPV prevalence among intimate partners as well as on the course of IPV over the perinatal period is scarce. The purpose of this review was to provide a narrative synthesis of the existing literature regarding the prevalence estimates of IPV among intimate partners over the perinatal period. Through this review, we also gained better insight into associated factors, as well as the various forms of IPV. Of the 766 studies assessing prevalence estimates identified, 86 were included, where 80 studies focused on unidirectional IPV (i.e., perpetrated by men against women) and six studies investigated bidirectional IPV (i.e., IPV perpetrated by both partners). Most of the included studies reported lower overall prevalence rates for unidirectional IPV postpartum (range: 2–58%) compared to pregnancy (range: 1.5–66.9%). Psychological violence was found to be the most prevalent form of violence during the entire perinatal period. Studies on bidirectional IPV mostly reported women's perpetration to be almost as high as that of their partner or even higher, yet their findings need to be interpreted with caution. In addition, our results also highlighted the associated factors of IPV among partners, in which they were assimilated into a multi-level ecological model and were analyzed through an intersectional framework. Based on our findings, IPV is found to be highly prevalent during the entire perinatal period and in populations suffering from social inequalities. Further research exploring not only the occurrence, but also the motivations and the context of the bidirectionality of IPV during the perinatal period may facilitate better understanding of the detrimental consequences on partners and their families, as well as the development of effective intervention strategies. Public health prevention approaches intervening at optimal times during the perinatal period are also needed.","Mojahed, Amera; Alaidarous, Nada; Kopp, Marie; Pogarell, Anneke; Thiel, Freya; Garthus-Niegel, Susan",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7900188/,311
15914,An Update on Pulmonary Hypertension in Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19),2020-11-10,"ABSTRACT: Senecavirus A (SVA) is an emerging picornavirus that has been associated with vesicular disease and neonatal mortality in swine. The construction of SVA virus carrying foreign reporter gene provides a powerful tool in virus research. However, it is often fraught with rescuing a recombinant picornavirus harboring a foreign gene or maintaining the stability of foreign gene in the virus genome. Here, we successfully generated recombinant SVA GD05/2017 viruses (V-GD05-clone) expressing the green fluorescent protein (iLOV), red fluorescent protein (RFP), or NanoLuc luciferase (Nluc). These recombinant viruses have comparable growth kinetics to the parental virus. Genetic stability analysis indicated that V-GD05-iLOV was highly stable in retaining iLOV gene for more than 10 passages, while V-GD05-RFP and V-GD05-Nluc lost the foreign genes in five passages. In addition, high-intensity fluorescent signals were found in the V-GD05-RFP- and V-GD05-iLOV-infected cells by fluorescence observation and flow cytometry analysis, and the luciferase activity assay could quantitatively monitor the replication of V-GD05-Nluc. In order to identify the porcine cell receptor for SVA, anthrax toxin receptor 1 (ANTXR1) was knocked out or overexpressed in the ST-R cells. The ANTXR1 knock-out cells lost the ability for SVA infection, while overexpression of ANTXR1 significantly increased the cell permissivity. These results confirmed that ANTXR1 was the receptor for SVA to invade porcine cells as reported in the human cells. Overall, this study suggests that these SVA reporter viruses will be useful tools in elucidating virus pathogenesis and developing control measures. KEY POINTS: • We successfully generated SVA viruses expressing the iLOV, RFP, or Nluc. • The iLOV was genetically stable in the V-GD05-iLOV genome over ten passages. • ANTXR1 was the receptor for SVA to invade porcine cells.

Surface imaging using time-of-flight camera is a new, non-invasive, non-contact, radiation-free, and easy-to-use technique that enables tidal volume and respiratory rate measurements. The objectives of the study were to determine the accuracy of Time-of-Flight volume (VT(TOF)) and respiratory rate (RR(TOF)) measurements at the bedside, and to validate its application for spontaneously breathing patients under high flow nasal canula. Data analysis was performed within the ReaSTOC data-warehousing project (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02893462). All data were recorded using standard monitoring devices, and the computerized medical file. Time-of-flight technique used a Kinect V2 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) to acquire the distance information, based on measuring the phase delay between the emitted light-wave and received backscattered signals. 44 patients (32 under mechanical ventilation; 12 under high-flow nasal canula) were recorded. High correlation (r = 0.84; p < 0.001), with low bias (-1.7 mL) and acceptable deviation (75 mL) was observed between VT(TOF) and VT(REF) under ventilation. Similar performance was observed for respiratory rate (r = 0.91; p < 0.001; bias < 1b/min; deviation ≤ 5b/min). Measurements were possible for all patients under high-flow nasal canula, detecting overdistension in 4 patients (tidal volume > 8 mL/kg) and low ventilation in 6 patients (tidal volume < 6 mL/kg). Tidal volume monitoring using time-of-flight camera (VT(TOF)) is correlated to reference values. Time-of-flight camera enables continuous and non-contact respiratory monitoring under high-flow nasal canula, and enables to detect tidal volume and respiratory rate changes, while modifying flow. It enables respiratory monitoring for spontaneously patients, especially while using high-flow nasal oxygenation.","L’Her, Erwan; Nazir, Souha; Pateau, Victoire; Visvikis, Dimitris",J Clin Monit Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8060689/,311
17071,Risk factors of postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis,2021-04-26,"Clinical reports on early immune dysregulation in acute pancreatitis (AP) are scarce. Herein we investigate the initial temporal development of selected biomarkers. Blood samples were taken at 0–24 and 25–48 h after onsets of AP were acquired. Mean values and temporal intermediate difference (delta-values) of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IFN-γ and TNF-α were calculated. Differences between severity groups, predictive capacity of the biomarkers and association with severe disease were analyzed. Paired comparison of samples (n = 115) taken at 0–24 and 25–48 h after onsets of AP showed a change over time for IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 (p < 0.05) and a significant difference between severity groups after 24 h. In ROC-analysis an IL-6 cut-off level of 196.6 pg/mL could differentiate severe AP (sensitivity 81.9, specificity 91.3). The delta-values of IL-1β and IL-6 were significantly associated with severe outcomes (odds ratios 1.085 and 1.002, respectively). Data of this work demonstrate a distinct change in IL-1β, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-6 over the first 48 h after onset of AP. The temporal development of biomarkers can assist in the early stratification of the disease. Herein IL-1β and IL-6 were associated with severe disease, however the prognostic capacity of investigated biomarkers is low.","Sternby, Hanna; Hartman, Hannes; Thorlacius, Henrik; Regnér, Sara",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8073083/,311
17087,Distal Pancreatectomy with Celiac Axis Resection: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2021-04-19,"Series of nanofibrous composites of polycaprolactone (PCL) were fabricated in different compositions of modified hydroxyapatite (HAP). The encapsulated HAP was co-doped with Ag/vanadate ions at different Ag contributions. XRD and FTIR techniques confirmed the powder and fibrous phase formation. Further, the morphological and mechanical behaviors of the electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds containing hydroxyapatite were investigated. The nanofibrous phases were biologically evaluated via studying contact angle, antibacterial, cell viability, and in vitro growth of human fibroblasts cell line (HFB4). It is obvious that silver ions cause gradual deviation in powder grains from wafer-like to cloudy grains. The maximum height of the roughness (R(t)) ranged from 902.0 to 956.9 nm, while the valley depth of the roughness (R(v)) ranged from 308.3 to 442.8 nm, for the lowest and the highest additional Ag ions for powdered phases. Moreover, the highest contribution of silver through the nanofibrous phases leads to the formation of lowest filaments size ranged from 0.07 to 0.53 µm. Further, the fracture strength was increased exponentially from 2.51 ± 0.35 MPa at zero concentration of silver ions up to 4.23 ± 0.64 MPa at 0.6 Ag/V-HAP@PCL. The fibrous phases were biologically evaluated in terms of antibacterial, cell viability, and in vitro growth of human fibroblasts cell line (HFB4). The nanofibrous composition of 0.8 Ag/V-HAP@PCL reached the maximum potential against E. coli and S. aureus and recorded 20.3 ± 1.1 and 19.8 ± 1.2 mm, respectively. This significant performance of the antibacterial activity and cell viability of co-doped HAP distributed through PCL could recommend these compositions for more research in biological applications, including wound healing.","El-Hamshary, Hany; El-Naggar, Mehrez E.; El-Faham, Ayman; Abu-Saied, M.

However, glioblastoma (GBM) patients have gained little benefit from PARP inhibitors due to a lack of BRCA mutations. Herein, we demonstrated that concurrent treatment with the PARP inhibitor rucaparib and the PI3K inhibitor BKM120 showed synergetic anticancer effects on GBM U251 and U87MG cells. Mechanistically, BKM120 decreased expression of HR molecules, including RAD51 and BRCA1/2, and reduced HR repair efficiency in GBM cells, therefore increasing levels of apoptosis induced by rucaparib. Furthermore, we discovered that the two compounds complemented each other in DNA damage response and drug accumulation. Notably, in the zebrafish U87MG-RFP orthotopic xenograft model, nude mouse U87MG subcutaneous xenograft model and U87MG-Luc orthotopic xenograft model, combination showed obviously increased antitumor efficacy compared to each monotherapy. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissues indicated that the combination obviously reduced expression of HR repair molecules and increased the DNA damage biomarker γ-H2AX, consistent with the in vitro results. Collectively, our findings provide new insight into combined blockade of PI3K and PARP, which might represent a promising therapeutic approach for GBM.","Zhang, Shaolu; Peng, Xin; Li, Xiaofei; Liu, Hongyan; Zhao, Baoquan; Elkabets, Moshe; Liu, Yao; Wang, Wei; Wang, Ran; Zhong, Yuxu; Kong, Dexin",Cell Death Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8150626/,311

18273,Cognitive development of children with Kawasaki disease and the parenting stress of their caregivers in Taiwan: a case–control study,2021-06-03,"BACKGROUND: One of the most widely used evaluation methods in miRNA experiments is qRT-PCR. However, selecting suitable internal controls (IC) is crucial for qRT-PCR experiments. Currently, there is no consensus on the ICs for miRNA qRT-PCR experiments in breast cancer. To this end, we tried to identify the most stable (the least expression alteration) and promising miRNAs in normal and tumor breast tissues by employing TCGA miRNA-Seq data and then experimentally validated them on fresh clinical samples. METHODS: A multi-component scoring system was used which takes into account multiple expression stability criteria as well as correlation with clinical characteristics. Furthermore, we extended the scoring system for more than two biological sub-groups. TCGA BRCA samples were analyzed based on two grouping criteria: Tumor & Normal samples and Tumor subtypes. The top 10 most stable miRNAs were further investigated by differential expression and survival analysis. Then, we examined the expression level of the top scored miRNA (hsa-miR-361-5p) along with two commonly used ICs hsa-miR-16-5p and U48 on 34 pairs of Primary breast tumor and their adjacent normal tissues using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: According to our multi-component scoring system, hsa-miR-361-5p had the highest stability score in both grouping criteria and hsa-miR-16-5p showed significantly lower scores. Based on our qRT-PCR assay, while U48 was the most abundant IC, hsa-miR-361-5p had lower standard deviation and also was the only IC capable of detecting a significant up-regulation of hsa-miR-21-5p in breast tumor tissue. CONCLUSIONS: miRNA-Seq data is a great source to discover stable ICs. Our results demonstrated that hsa-miR-361-5p is a highly stable miRNA in tumor and non-tumor breast tissue and we recommend it as a suitable reference gene for miRNA expression studies in breast cancer. Additionally, although hsa-miR-16-5p is a commonly used IC, it’s not a suitable one for breast cancer studies.","Ghanbari, Sogol; Salimi, Adel; Rahmani, Saeid; Nafissi, Nahid; Sharifi-Zarchi, Ali; Mowla, Seyed Javad",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8186776/,311

In particular, hollow gold nanostructures are highly promising for practical applications, with significant advantages being found in their material properties and structures: 1) the interaction between the outer surface plasmon mode and inner cavity mode leads to a greater resonance, allowing it to absorb near-infrared light, which can readily penetrate tissue; 2) it has anti-corrosiveness and good biocompatibility, which makes it suitable for biomedical applications; 3) it shows a reduced net density and large surface area, allowing the possibility of nanocarriers for drug delivery. In this review, we present information on the classification, characteristics, and synthetic methods of hollow gold nanostructures; discuss the recent advances in hollow gold nanostructures in biomedical applications, including biosensing, bioimaging, photothermal therapy, and drug delivery; and report on the existing challenges and prospects for hollow gold nanostructures.","Park, Jeong-Min; Choi, Hye Eun; Kudaibergen, Dauletkerey; Kim, Jae-Hyuk; Kim, Ki Su",Front Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8217768/,311
18665,Intraoperative protective ventilation in patients undergoing major neurosurgical interventions: a randomized clinical trial,2021-06-30,"BACKGROUND: Psittacosis, which is also known as parrot fever, is Chlamydia psittaci (C. psittaci) caused infectious disease. The clinical manifestations vary from asymptomatic infection to severe atypical pneumonia or even fatal meningitis. Early recognition of psittacosis is difficult because of its nonspecific clinical manifestations. Culture and gene probe techniques for C. psittaci are not available for routine clinical use, which makes the diagnosis difficult too. Although psittacosis has increasingly been recognized and reported in recent years, cure of severe pneumonia complicated with meningitis, with etiologic diagnosis aided by the use of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), is still uncommon. So, it is necessary to report and review such potentially fatal case. CASE PRESENTATION: This report describes a 54-year-old woman with C. psittaci caused severe atypical pneumonia and meningitis. She presented with symptoms of fever, dry cough and dyspnea, accompanied by prominent headache. Her condition deteriorated rapidly to respiratory failure and lethargy under the treatment of empirical antibacterial agents, and was treated with invasive mechanical ventilation soon. She denied contact with birds, poultry or horses, but unbiased mNGS of both the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) identified sequence reads corresponding to C. psittaci infection, and there was no sequence read corresponding to other probable pathogens. Combined use of targeted antimicrobial agents of tetracyclines, macrolides and fluoroquinolones was carried out, and the patient’s condition improved and she was discharged home 28 days later. Her status returned close to premorbid condition on day 60 of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: When clinicians come across a patient with atypical pneumonia accompanied by symptoms of meningitis, psittacosis should be taken into consideration. mNGS is a promising detection method in such condition and is recommended.

19011,Rationale and design of the EPCHF trial: the early palliative care in heart failure trial (EPCHF),2021-07-09,"BACKGROUND: With the increased ageing of society, more and more elderly people are admitted to the intensive care unit, How to accurately predict whether elderly patients can successfully wean from the ventilator is more complicated. Diaphragmatic excursion (DE) and diaphragm thickening fraction (DTF) were measured by bedside ultrasound to assess diaphragm function. The lung ultrasound score (LUS) and the rapid shallow breathing index (RBSI) were used as indices of diaphragm function to predict the outcome of weaning from mechanical ventilation. The aim of this study was to examine the clinical utility of these parameters in predicting extubation success. METHODS: This prospective study included 101 consecutive elderly patients undergoing a trial of extubation in the ICU of Haidian Hospital between June 2017 and July 2020. Patients were divided into the successful weaning group (n = 69) and the failed weaning group (n = 32). Baseline characteristics, including RSBI, were recorded. Measurements of DE, DTF and LUS were made using ultrasound within 24 h before extubation. RESULTS: Median DE was greater in patients with extubation success than in those with extubation failure (1.64 cm vs. 0.78 cm, p = 0.001). Patients with extubation success had a greater DTF than those with extubation failure (49.48% vs. 27.85%, p = 0.001). The areas under the receiver operating curves for the RSBI, LUS, DE and DFT were 0.680, 0.764, 0.831 and 0.881, respectively. The best cut-off values for predicting successful weaning were DTF ≥ 30%, DE ≥ 1.3 cm, LUS ≤ 11, and RSBI ≤ 102. The specificity of DTF (84%) in predicting weaning outcome was higher than that of RBSI (53%), that of LUS (55%), and that of DE (62%). The sensitivity of DTF (94%) was greater than that of RBSI (85%), that of LUS (71%), and that of DE (65%). The combination of RSBI, LUS, DE, and DTF showed the highest AUC (AUC = 0.919), with a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 89%. CONCLUSIONS: DTF has higher sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of successful weaning in elderly patients than the other parameters examined. The combination of RSBI, LUS, DE and DFT performed well in predicting weaning outcome. This has potentially important clinical application and merits further evaluation.","Li, Shigang; Chen, Zhe; Yan, Weifeng",BMC Pulm Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8267769/,311

In the present study, a new infectious clone of the BoHV-4 genome carrying a bacterial artificial chromosome vector (BoHV-4-BAC) was developed by homologous recombination in mammalian cell culture and bacterial systems, and exploited to express a truncated form of glycoprotein D (tgD) of Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) (BoHV-4-tgD∆TK) as a vaccine candidate. This construct’s immunogenicity was compared to a DNA vector expressing the same antigen (pC-tgD) in a BALB/c mouse model. After the mice were immunized, total and specific antibody responses, cytokine responses, total splenocyte cells proliferation/cytotoxicity, and virus neutralization assays were conducted to analyze the immune response elicited by both constructs. Mice from both vaccine groups developed significant humoral and cellular immune responses after a booster dose regime was conducted on day 28 post-injection. In almost all immunological assays, BoHV-4-tgDΔTK induced as high an immune response as pC-tgD. In both vaccine constructs, neutralizing antibodies were a significant determining factor in protection against BoHV-1, even after the first injection. We conclude that a BoHV-4-based viral vector offers an effective immunization strategy as an alternative to DNA-based immunization platforms, at least to combat BoHV-1.","Bilge-Dagalp, Seval; Farzani, Touraj Aligholipour; Dogan, Firat; Akkutay Yoldar, Zeynep; Ozkul, Aykut; Alkan, Feray; Donofrio, Gaetano",Braz J Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8275906/,311

19743,Variable clinical characteristics and laboratory results in five patients with Chinese Good's syndrome (thymoma and hypogammaglobulinemia): an 8-year retrospective analysis in a university hospital in China,2021-08-03,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Honey bees are eusocial insects that live in colonies comprised of ~30,000 individuals. They are the primary pollinators of plants that produce fruits, nuts, and vegetables. High annual losses of honey bee colonies have made it challenging for beekeepers to provide enough colonies to meet the demand for pollination services. Multiple stressors, including viruses, contribute to colony deaths. To better understand viral pathogenesis and bee antiviral defense mechanisms, we obtained primary cells from honey bee larvae and pupae, maintained them in culture, and infected them with a panel of viruses. We determined that larval hemocytes, which are primary immune cells, support replication of a honey bee virus (sacbrood virus) and a model virus (Flock House virus). Similarly, we determined that mixed cell populations derived from honey bee pupae support replication of sacbrood virus, Flock House virus, and another honey bee virus (deformed wing virus). Evaluation of the host cellular level response to infections with each of these viruses revealed unique expression profiles of three immune genes. In summary, this study demonstrates the utility of honey bee primary cell cultures to investigate the impacts of virus infection on honey bees at the cellular level, which in turn affects individual bee and colony health. ABSTRACT: Honey bee (Apis mellifera) health is impacted by viral infections at the colony, individual bee, and cellular levels. To investigate honey bee antiviral defense mechanisms at the cellular level we further developed the use of cultured primary cells, derived from either larvae or pupae, and demonstrated that these cells could be infected with a panel of viruses, including common honey bee infecting viruses (i.e., sacbrood virus (SBV) and deformed wing virus (DWV)) and an insect model virus, Flock House virus (FHV). Virus abundances were quantified over the course of infection. The production of infectious virions in cultured honey bee pupal cells was demonstrated by determining that naïve cells became infected after the transfer of deformed wing virus or Flock House virus from infected cell cultures. Initial characterization of the honey bee antiviral immune responses at the cellular level indicated that there were virus-specific responses, which included increased expression of bee antiviral protein-1 (GenBank: MF116383) in SBV-infected pupal cells and increased expression of argonaute-2 and dicer-like in FHV-infected hemocytes and pupal cells. Additional studies are required to further elucidate virus-specific honey bee antiviral defense mechanisms. The continued use of cultured primary honey bee cells for studies that involve multiple viruses will address this knowledge gap.","McMenamin, Alexander J.; Parekh, Fenali; Lawrence, Verena; Flenniken, Michelle L.",Insects,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8329929/,311

In the present study, we analyzed the population-specific differences of coronary artery disease (CAD) between European and East Asian descents. In stage 1, we identified CAD susceptibility genes by gene-based tests in European and East Asian populations. We identified two novel susceptibility genes for CAD, namely, CUX2 and OAS3. In stage 2, we carried out meta-analyses for the population-specific variants. rs599839 (PSRC1) represented a protective variant for CAD in East Asian populations (OR(ASN) = 0.72. 95% CI: 0.63-0.81) but a risk factor in European populations (OR(EUR) = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.93-1.36). In stage 3, we enriched the risk genes and explored the population-specific differences in Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), regulatory element, tissues, and cell types. In stage 4, in order to predict genes that showed pleiotropic/potentially causal association with CAD, we integrated summary-level data from independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) by using summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR). The results showed that NBEAL1 and FGD6 were population-specific pleiotropic/causal genes. Although some potential mutations and risk genes of CAD are shared, it is still of great significance to elucidate the genetic differences among different populations.

The aim of this study is to develop a multistate predictive model to estimate the future burden of CKD in Chile, given the high and rising RRT rates, population ageing, and prevalence of comorbidities contributing to CKD. METHODS: A dynamic stock and flow model was developed to simulate CKD progression in the Chilean population aged 40 years and older, up to the year 2041, adopting the perspective of the Chilean public healthcare system. The model included six states replicating progression of CKD, which was assumed in 1-year cycles and was categorised as slow, medium or fast progression, based on the underlying conditions. We simulated two different treatment scenarios. Only direct costs of treatment were included, and a 3% per year discount rate was applied after the first year. We calibrated the model based on international evidence; the exploration of uncertainty (95% credibility intervals) was undertaken with probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: By the year 2041, there is an expected increase in cases of CKD stages 3a to ESKD, ceteris paribus, from 442,265 (95% UI 441,808–442,722) in 2021 to 735,513 (734,455–736,570) individuals. Direct costs of CKD stages 3a to ESKD would rise from 322.4M GBP (321.7–323.1) in 2021 to 1,038.6M GBP (1,035.5–1,041.8) in 2041. A reduction in the progression rates of the disease by the inclusion of SGLT2 inhibitors and pre-dialysis treatment would decrease the number of individuals worsening to stages 5 and ESKD, thus reducing the total costs of CKD by 214.6M GBP in 2041 to 824.0M GBP (822.7–825.3). CONCLUSIONS: This model can be a useful tool for healthcare planning, with development of preventive or treatment plans to reduce and delay the progression of the disease and thus the anticipated increase in the healthcare costs of CKD.","Walbaum, Magdalena; Scholes, Shaun; Rojas, Rubén; Mindell, Jennifer S.; Pizzo, Elena",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8425564/,311

24244,Management of Severe Malaria,2019-07-24,"Viral infections are important as causes of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Severe viral infections are more common after unrelated and mismatched donor SCT and in particular after haploidentical SCT. B-cell function and specific antibodies are the main defense mechanisms against infection with exogenous viruses, thus reducing the risk for reinfection in already seropositive individuals. On the other hand, T-cell function in particular cytotoxic T-cell function is the main mechanism for preventing severe viral disease and also for the control of viruses such as herpesviruses that can cause latency and thus reactivate in an immunocompromised individual. The immune defects in SCT-patients are frequently complex with defects in cytotoxic T-lymphocyte, helper T-lymphocyte, NK-cell, and B-lymphocyte functions. T-cell dysfunction is usually most important early after SCT while deficient B-cell reconstitution can remain for many years after SCT. Furthermore, since loss of specific antibodies occurs frequently over time after allogeneic SCT, this will also increase the risk for reinfections with previously encountered viruses such as measles or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and allow reactivation of viruses controlled by antibodies such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) [1, 2].","Ljungman, Per",Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120500/,311

While these infections are frequently encountered in the general population, the spectrum of their clinical presentation including morbidity and mortality is increased in patients undergoing transplantation procedures. Impaired innate and adaptive immunity, potential anatomical abnormalities resulting from extensive surgical procedures, presences of indwelling medical devices, and increased healthcare exposure put transplant recipients at particularly high risk for respiratory tract disease. Infections of the respiratory tract can be divided into those affecting the paranasal sinuses, the upper airways such as bronchitis and tracheobronchitis, and the lower airways like pneumonia. Each of these clinical syndromes can further be classified based on their chronicity, acute vs. chronic; their setting, community vs. nosocomial; and the etiology such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and rarely parasites. It is also important to realize that such immunologically vulnerable patients are at risk for polymicrobial infection that may present concurrently or in a sequential, consecutive fashion. This chapter reviews the common respiratory tract infections affecting transplant recipients with particular attention directed toward epidemiological risk factors, clinical presentations, diagnostic strategies, and common pathogens. Specific causes of opportunistic pneumonias are also reviewed.","Miko, Benjamin A.; Pereira, Marcus R.; Safdar, Amar",Principles and Practice of Transplant Infectious Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120972/,311

It is understood that the emergency is characterized by limited time and information, harmfulness and uncertainty, and decision‐makers are always critically bound by uncertainty and risk. This paper introduces many novel approaches to addressing the emergency situation of COVID‐19 under spherical fuzzy environment. Fundamentally, the paper includes six main sections to achieve appropriate and accurate measures to address the situation of emergency decision‐making. As the spherical fuzzy set (FS) is a generalized framework of fuzzy structure to handle more uncertainty and ambiguity in decision‐making problems (DMPs). First, we discuss basic algebraic operational laws (AOLs) under spherical FS. In addition, elaborate on the deficiency of existing AOLs and present three cases to address the validity of the proposed novel AOLs under spherical fuzzy settings. Second, we present a list of Einstein aggregation operators (AgOp) based on the Einstein norm to aggregate uncertain information in DMPs. Thirdly, we are introducing two techniques to demonstrate the unknown weight of the criteria. Fourthly, we develop extended TOPSIS and Gray relational analysis approaches based on AgOp with unknown weight information of the criteria. In fifth, we design three algorithms to address the uncertainty and ambiguity information in emergency DMPs. Finally, the numerical case study of the novel carnivorous (COVID‐19) situation is provided as an application for emergency decision‐making based on the proposed three algorithms. Results explore the effectiveness of our proposed methodologies and provide accurate emergency measures to address the global uncertainty of COVID‐19.","Ashraf, Shahzaib; Abdullah, Saleem",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7461096/,311

The need for these tools dates back to the market crash of 1987, when investors needed better ways to protect their portfolios through option insurance. These tools provide greater flexibility to trade and hedge volatile swings in Bitcoin prices effectively. The violation of constant volatility and the log-normality assumption of the Black–Scholes option pricing model led to the discovery of the volatility smile, smirk, or skew in options markets. These stylized facts; that is, the volatility smile and implied volatilities implied by the option prices, are well documented in the option literature for almost all financial markets. These are expected to be true for Bitcoin options as well. The data sets for the study are based on short-dated Bitcoin options (14-day maturity) of two time periods traded on Deribit Bitcoin Futures and Options Exchange, a Netherlands-based cryptocurrency derivative exchange. The estimated results are compared with benchmark Black–Scholes implied volatility values for accuracy and efficiency analysis. This study has two aims: (1) to provide insights into the volatility smile in Bitcoin options and (2) to estimate the implied volatility of Bitcoin options through numerical approximation techniques, specifically the Newton Raphson and Bisection methods. The experimental results show that Bitcoin options belong to the commodity class of assets based on the presence of a volatility forward skew in Bitcoin option data. Moreover, the Newton Raphson and Bisection methods are effective in estimating the implied volatility of Bitcoin options.

58843,Profile of Immunoglobulin G N-Glycome in COVID-19 Patients: A Case-Control Study,2021-09-23,"Today’s audio, visual, and internet technologies allow people to interact despite physical distances, for casual conversation, group workouts, or musical performance. Musical ensemble performance is unique because interaction integrity critically depends on the timing between each performer’s actions and when their acoustic outcomes arrive. Acoustic transmission latency (ATL) between players is substantially longer for networked music performance (NMP) compared to traditional in-person spaces where musicians can easily adapt. Previous work has shown that longer ATLs slow the average tempo in ensemble performance, and that asymmetric co-actor roles and empathy-related traits affect coordination patterns in joint action. Thus, we are interested in how musicians collectively adapt to a given latency and how such adaptation patterns vary with their task-related and person-related asymmetries. Here, we examined how two pianists performed duets while hearing each other’s auditory outcomes with an ATL of 10, 20, or 40 ms. To test the hypotheses regarding task-related asymmetries, we designed duets such that pianists had: (1) a starting or joining role and (2) a similar or dissimilar musical part compared to their co-performer, with respect to pitch range and melodic contour. Results replicated previous clapping-duet findings showing that longer ATLs are associated with greater temporal asynchrony between partners and increased average tempo slowing. While co-performer asynchronies were not affected by performer role or part similarity, at the longer ATLs starting performers displayed slower tempos and smaller tempo variability than joining performers. This asymmetry of stability vs. flexibility between starters and joiners may sustain coordination, consistent with recent joint action findings. Our data also suggest that relative independence in musical parts may mitigate ATL-related challenges. Additionally, there may be a relationship between co-performer differences in empathy-related personality traits such as locus of control and coordination during performance under the influence of ATL. Incorporating the emergent coordinative dynamics between performers could help further innovation of music technologies and composition techniques for NMP.","Washburn, Auriel; Wright, Matthew J.; Chafe, Chris; Fujioka, Takako",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8500175/,311

The real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction is the most widely used confirmatory test for COVID-19 detection. This study aimed to find out the prevalence of COVID-19 infection detected by gold standard reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test in a tertiary care center of Nepal. METHODS A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in Karnali Academy of Health Sciences from May to August 2020 after taking ethical approval from the Institutional Review Committee of Karnali Academy of Health Sciences, Jumla. Convenient sampling was used. A total of 361 participants enrolled in this study who have done real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for screening of COVID-19 infection. Also, a designated questionnaire was obtained from persons with a travel history and close contact. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software was used for the statistical analysis. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and proportion for binary data. RESULTS The prevalence of COVID-19 was 167 (46.3%) (95% Confidence Interval= 41.16-51.44) by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test. Out of 361 samples, 339 (93.9%) were male and 22 (6%) were female. The highest frequency of the participants belongs to the age groups of 20-40 years. CONCLUSIONS The findings showed a high prevalence of COVID-19 detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test.

BACKGROUND The nursing profession experiences a great deal of stress at work because of high concentration in the work. This leads to serious physical and psychological consequences that make their resilience challenging. METHOD The current study is descriptive qualitatively by type and inductive by approach. The study's statistical population consisted of nurses from the Iranian Coronavirus Service and a sample of 11 nurses selected using a teleological sampling method. An interview tool used to collect qualitative data and the thematic analysis technique used to analyze interview data. RESULTS The main research issue studied using the thematic analysis technique and seven main themes identified as the components of effective spirituality affecting the resilience of nurses in the coronavirus ward in Iran. CONCLUSION The results of data analysis showed that seven components affecting resilience of nurses in the Corona ward are religious values, morality, self-awareness, patience and hope, wisdom, voluntary activities and the otherworld belief.

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2021-05-27,"Equitable access to contraception is critical for reproductive autonomy. Using cross-sectional data from the DocStyles survey administered September-October 2020 (68% response rate), we compared changes in family planning-related clinical services and healthcare delivery strategies before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and assessed service provision issues among 1063 U.S. physicians whose practice provided family planning services just before the pandemic. About one-fifth of those whose practices provided the following services or strategies just before the pandemic discontinued these services during the pandemic: long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) placement (16%); LARC removal (17%); providing or prescribing emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) in advance (18%); and reminding patients about contraception injections or LARC removal or replacement (20%). Many practices not providing the following services or strategies just before the pandemic initiated these services during the pandemic: telehealth for contraception initiation (43%); telehealth for contraception continuation (48%); and renewing contraception prescriptions without requiring an office visit (36%). While a smaller proportion of physicians reported service provision issues in the month before survey completion than at any point during the pandemic, about one-third still reported fewer adult females seeking care (37%) and technical challenges with telehealth (32%). Discontinuation of key family planning services during the COVID-19 pandemic may limit contraception access and impede reproductive autonomy. Implementing healthcare service delivery strategies that reduce the need for in-person visits (e.g., telehealth for contraception, providing or prescribing ECPs in advance) may decrease disruptions in care.

To address this, we developed a satisfaction survey for people with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital during the first COVID-19 wave in Liverpool. Of those invited, 98/160 (61%) responded, of whom 94/98 (96%) completed the survey. Respondents rated overall care highly (mean 4.7/5) and 89/94 (95%) reported that they would recommend the hospital to friends and/or family. Most respondents felt safe on the ward (94%), with privacy maintained (93%) and pain well managed (90%). Fewer than two-thirds (63%) of respondents considered themselves adequately consulted regarding medications and side effects. Sleep and food/drink quality were also highlighted as areas for improvement. To overcome the issues raised, we generated a 'COVID-19 practice pointers' poster within an integrated educational bundle on COVID-19 wards. The impact of the bundle on perceptions of people hospitalised with COVID-19 will be evaluated in people hospitalised with COVID-19 in Liverpool in 2021.

This study reviewed the characteristics and outcomes of individuals who attended the centre for COVID-19 testing. METHODS This retrospective cross-sectional study collected epidemiological and clinical data. The primary outcome was a positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 test result, according to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses of pooled nasopharyngeal and throat swabs collected at the centre. The relationships of clinical characteristics with SARS-CoV-2 positive test results were assessed by multivariable binary logistic regression. RESULTS Of 1258 attendees included in the analysis, 86 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (positivity rate=6.84%; 95% confidence interval [CI]=5.57%-8.37%). Of these 86 individuals, 40 (46.5%) were aged 15 to 24 years and 81 (94.2%) had a history of recent travel. Symptoms were reported by 86.0% and 96.3% of individuals with positive and negative test results, respectively. The clinical characteristics most strongly associated with a positive test result were anosmia (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj]=8.30; 95% CI=1.12-127.09) and fever ORadj=1.32; 95% CI=1.02-3.28). CONCLUSION The temporary test centre successfully helped identify individuals with COVID-19 who exhibited mild disease symptoms.

RECENT FINDINGS Recent data suggest that not all patients with sleep apnea get their disease for the same reason. As such, no one variable is effective at defining which patients do or do not have sleep apnea. Identifying the mechanism(s) underlying OSA for an individual is helpful as it can help to determine whether personalized therapy could be developed based on an individual's characteristics. In addition, these underlying mechanisms may be helpful in predicting response to therapy and prognosticating regarding future complications. SUMMARY OSA is a heterogeneous disease with highly varying underlying mechanisms. OSA has variable clinical manifestations with definable subsets having risk of particular complications. Future studies will be helpful to identify mechanisms underlying OSA using clinically accessible tools and then using these data to focus individualized treatment approaches.","Malhotra, Atul; Mesarwi, Omar; Pepin, Jean-Louis; Owens, Robert L",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0000000000000724; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890019/,311

Its exquisite sensitivity enables time-lapse optical biopsies that capture minute changes in the structure and physiological processes of cells in the living eye. This information is increasingly used to detect disease onset and monitor disease progression during early stages, raising the possibility of personalized eye care. Powerful high-resolution imaging tools have been in development for more than two decades; one that has garnered considerable interest in recent years is optical coherence tomography enhanced with adaptive optics. State-of-the-art adaptive optics optical coherence tomography (AO-OCT) makes it possible to visualize even highly transparent cells and measure some of their internal processes at all depths within the retina, permitting reconstruction of a 3D view of the living microscopic retina.

This study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of the echocardiographic E / (Ea×Sa) index guided diuretic therapy compared to urine output (conventional) guided diuretic treatment.Material and Methods In this cross-sectional study, patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who were hospitalized due to acute decompensation episode were consecutively allocated in a 1:1 ratio to monitoring arms. The diuretic dose, which provided 20 % reduction in the E / (Ea×Sa) index value compared to initial value, was determined as adequate dose in echocardiography guided monitoring group. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), change in weight, NT pro-BNP level and dyspnea assessment on visual analogue scale (VAS) were analyzed at the end of the monitoring.Results Although the similar doses of diuretics were used in both groups, the patients with E / (Ea×Sa) index guided strategy had the substantial lower NT pro-BNP level within 72 hours after diuretic administration (2172 vs.2514 pg / mL, p= 0.036). VAS score on dyspnea assessment was significantly better in the patients with E / (Ea×Sa) index guided strategy (52 vs. 65; p= 0.04). And, in term of body weight loss (4.93 vs.5.21 kg, p=0.87) and e-GFR (54.58±8.6 vs. 52.65±9.1 mL / min / 1.73 m2p=0.74) in both groups are associated with similar outcomes. In both groups, there was no worsening renal function and electrolyte imbalance that required stopping or decreasing loop diuretic dosing.Conclusions The E / (Ea×Sa) index guidance might be a safe strategy for more effective diuretic response that deserves consideration for selected a subgroup of acute decomposed HFrEF patients.","Karakus, Alper; Uguz, Berat",Kardiologiia,https://doi.org/10.18087/cardio.2021.2.n1472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33715612/,311

65807,Durability of Treatment Effect Using a Drug-Coated Balloon for Femoropopliteal Lesions: 24-Month Results of IN.PACT SFA.,2015,"OBJECTIVE Surgery for brain aneurysms is technically demanding. In recent years, the process to learn the technical skills necessary for these challenging procedures has been affected by a decrease in the number of surgical cases available and progressive restrictions on resident training hours. To overcome these limitations, surgical simulators such as cadaver heads and human placenta models have been developed. However, the effectiveness of these models in improving technical skills is unknown. This study assessed concurrent and predictive validity of brain aneurysm surgery simulation in a human placenta model compared with a ""live"" human brain cadaveric model. METHODS Two human cadaver heads and 30 human placentas were used. Twelve neurosurgeons participated in the concurrent validity part of this study, each operating on 1 human cadaver head aneurysm model and 1 human placenta model. Simulators were evaluated regarding their ability to simulate different surgical steps encountered during real surgery. The time to complete the entire aneurysm task in each simulator was analyzed. The predictive validity component of the study involved 9 neurosurgical residents divided into 3 groups to perform simulation exercises, each lasting 6 weeks. The training for the 3 groups consisted of educational video only (3 residents), human cadaver only (3 residents), and human placenta only (3 residents). All residents had equivalent microsurgical experience with superficial brain tumor surgery. After completing their practice training, residents in each of the 3 simulation groups performed surgery for an unruptured middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm, and their performance was assessed by an experienced vascular neurosurgeon who watched the operative videos. RESULTS All human cadaver heads and human placentas were suitable to simulate brain aneurysm surgery. In the concurrent validity portion of the experiment, the placenta model required a longer time (p < 0.001) than cadavers to complete the task. The placenta model was considered more effective than the cadaver model in simulating sylvian fissure splitting, bipolar coagulation of oozing microvessels, and aneurysm neck and dome dissection. Both models were equally effective in simulating neck aneurysm clipping, while the cadaver model was considered superior for simulation of intraoperative rupture and for reproduction of real anatomy during simulation. In the predictive validity portion of the experiment, residents were evaluated for 4 tasks: sylvian fissure dissection, microvessel bipolar coagulation, aneurysm dissection, and aneurysm clipping. Residents trained in the human placenta simulator consistently had the highest overall performance scores when compared with those who had trained in the cadaver model and those who had simply watched operative videos (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The human placenta biological simulator provides excellent simulation for some critical tasks of aneurysm surgery such as splitting of the sylvian fissure, dissection of the aneurysm neck and dome, and bipolar coagulation of surrounding microvessels. When performing surgery for an unruptured MCA aneurysm, residents who had trained in the human placenta model performed better than residents trained with other simulation scenarios/models. In this age of reduced exposure to aneurysm surgery and restrictions on resident working hours, the placenta model is a valid simulation for microneurosurgery with striking similarities with real surgery.","de Oliveira, Marcelo Magaldi Ribeiro; Ferrarez, Carlos Eduardo; Ramos, Taise Mosso; Malheiros, Jose Augusto; Nicolato, Arthur; Machado, Carla Jorge; Ferreira, Mauro Tostes; de Oliveira, Fellype Borges; de Sousa, Cecília Félix Penido Mendes; Costa, Pollyana Helena Vieira; Gusmao, Sebastiao; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Maestro, Rolando Del",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2016.10.jns162083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28338438/,311

A key social determinant of health for TGE adolescents and emerging adults is gender affirmation, which encompasses multidimensional validations of an individual's lived gender. Lacking available resources for one's gender affirmation, TGE young people may engage in high-risk maladaptive coping behaviors, linked to their disproportionately high HIV-acquisition risk. A range of innovative mobile technologies are guided by the Gender-Affirmative Framework to promote the health of TGE communities, including through HIV prevention and care continuum outcomes. The aim of this review was to examine key features of existing mobile technologies that can be leveraged to advance the field of TGE-responsive mHealth. We systematically searched scientific records, gray literature, and the iOS and Android app distribution services. To be eligible, platforms and interventions needed to be tailored exclusively to a TGE user base, incorporate gender-affirming features, and be optimized for or adaptive to mobile technologies. Eligible interventions (N=24) were compared on evidence of utility, core functionalities, and dimensions of gender affirmation. Smartphone applications (apps) and webapps (n=16) were the most common delivery modality. Many interventions (n=9) aimed to address HIV-related outcomes and integrated gender-affirmative features. The most common gender-affirmative features originated in fields of human-computer interactions and informatics, or were crowdfunded by TGE developers. HIV-focused interventions incorporated evidence-based health behavior change strategies and utilized rigorous evaluation methods. Across modalities and disciplines, behavioral self-monitoring and access to HIV prevention services were the most frequent features. Over two-thirds of the interventions reviewed aimed to provide medical gender affirmation (e.g, provided guidance on obtaining medically sanctioned hormone therapies, or safely practicing non-medical options such as chest-binding) or psychological gender affirmation (e.g, provided linkage to mental health counseling). Our results show that mHealth and other technology-mediated interventions offer a diverse range of both evidence-based and innovative features; however, many have not been rigorously evaluated in a randomized controlled trial to support TGE users. A continuing commitment to evidence-based health behavior change strategies, exemplified by the HIV-focused interventions included in this review, is essential to advancing gender-affirmative mHealth. The unique and highly innovative features of platforms originating outside the fields of HIV prevention and care suggest new directions for TGE-responsive mHealth, and the need for more conscientious models of knowledge exchange with investigators across scientific disciplines, private-sector developers, and potential users.","Skeen, Simone J; Cain, Demetria; Gamarel, Kristi E; Hightow-Weidman, Lisa; Reback, Cathy J",mHealth,https://doi.org/10.21037/mhealth-20-60; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898606/,311

Given the chemical interaction between calcium and phosphate (Pi), the increased serum Pi in chronic kidney disease may cause changes in the composition and structure of the prCa fraction. Here, we report the phosphate binding on the protein-bound calcium in uremic rat serum. Using adenine-fed rats as a uremic model, we separated the calcium and phosphate fractions in rat serum by ultrafiltration, and found that the level of protein-bound phosphate (prPi) in the uremic serum was markedly higher than in control. The elevated prPi level was comparable to the prCa level, consistent with the presence of protein-bound calcium phosphate pr(Ca)j-m(CaPi)m. We then confirmed its presence by ex vivo X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, revealing the discrete state of the calcium phosphate clusters associated with protein. Finally, in a quantitative investigation using Ca- and Pi-boosted serum, we discovered the threshold concentration for the Pi binding on prCa, and determined the binding constant. The threshold, while preventing Pi from binding to prCa in normal condition, allows the reaction to take place in hyperphosphatemia conditions. The protein-bound calcium phosphate could act as a link between the metabolism of serum proteins and the homeostasis of phosphate and calcium, and it deserves further investigation whether the molar ratio of (prPi/prCa)⋅100% may serve as a serum index of the vascular calcification status in chronic kidney disease.","Fan, Hong-Xing; Gou, Bao-Di; Gao, Yu-Xi; Wu, Gang; Liu, Shu-Hu; Li, Fan; Zhang, Tian-Lan",Journal of biological inorganic chemistry : JBIC : a publication of the Society of Biological Inorganic Chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00775-020-01807-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839886/,311
67161,Current perspective for tube feeding in the elderly: from identifying malnutrition to providing of enteral nutrition.,2018,"Autophagy plays important roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis. It uses double- or multiple-membrane vesicles termed autophagosomes to remove protein aggregates and damaged organelles from the cytoplasm for recycling. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been shown to induce autophagy to enhance its own replication. Here we describe a procedure that combines membrane flotation and affinity chromatography for the purification of autophagosomes from cells that harbor an HCV subgenomic RNA replicon. The purified autophagosomes had double- or multiple-membrane structures with a diameter ranging from 200 nm to 600 nm. The analysis of proteins associated with HCV-induced autophagosomes by proteomics led to the identification of HCV nonstructural proteins as well as proteins involved in membrane trafficking. Notably, caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and annexin A2, which are proteins associated with lipid rafts, were also identified. The association of lipid rafts with HCV-induced autophagosomes was confirmed by Western blotting, immunofluorescence microscopy, and immunoelectron microscopy. Their association with autophagosomes was also confirmed in HCV-infected cells. The association of lipid rafts with autophagosomes was specific to HCV, as it was not detected in autophagosomes induced by nutrient starvation. Further analysis indicated that the autophagosomes purified from HCV replicon cells could mediate HCV RNA replication in a lipid raft-dependent manner, as the depletion of cholesterol, a major component of lipid rafts, from autophagosomes abolished HCV RNA replication. Our studies thus demonstrated that HCV could specifically induce the association of lipid rafts with autophagosomes for its RNA replication.IMPORTANCE HCV can cause severe liver diseases, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is one of the most important human pathogens. Infection with HCV can lead to the reorganization of membrane structures in its host cells, including the induction of autophagosomes. In this study, we developed a procedure to purify HCV-induced autophagosomes and demonstrated that HCV could induce the localization of lipid rafts to autophagosomes to mediate its RNA replication. This finding provided important information for further understanding the life cycle of HCV and its interaction with the host cells.","Kim, Ja Yeon; Wang, Linya; Lee, Jiyoung; Ou, Jing-Hsiung James",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00541-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28747506/,311

67673,First closed-loop goal directed fluid therapy during surgery: a pilot study.,2014,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly identified betacoronavirus causing high morbidity and mortality in humans. The coronavirus spike (S) protein is the main determinant of viral entry, and although it was previously shown that MERS-CoV S can be activated by various proteases, the details of the mechanisms of proteolytic activation of fusion are still incompletely characterized. Here, we have uncovered distinctive characteristics of MERS-CoV S. We identify, by bioinformatics and peptide cleavage assays, two cleavage sites for furin, a ubiquitously expressed protease, which are located at the S1/S2 interface and at the S2' position of the S protein. We show that although the S1/S2 site is proteolytically processed by furin during protein biosynthesis, the S2' site is cleaved upon viral entry. MERS-CoV pseudovirion infection was shown to be enhanced by elevated levels of furin expression, and entry could be decreased by furin siRNA silencing. Enhanced furin activity appeared to partially override the low pH-dependent nature of MERS-CoV entry. Inhibition of furin activity was shown to decrease MERS-CoV S-mediated entry, as well as infection by the virus. Overall, we show that MERS-CoV has evolved an unusual two-step furin activation for fusion, suggestive of a role during the process of emergence into the human population.

METHODS A prospectively acquired database of all endonasal endoscopic surgeries performed over a 5-year period at Weill Cornell Medical College starting in September 2005 was reviewed. RESULTS The gasket seal was used in 46 consecutive patients. Mean age was 53 years (range 7-83 years). All patients had extensive intracranial disease with a significant intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. Pathology included craniopharyngioma (39.1%), meningioma (23.9%), and pituitary adenoma (17.4%). After a mean follow-up of 28 months (range 3-63 months), two (4.3%) patients had a postoperative CSF leak. Excluding the patients with adenomas, the CSF leak rate was 5.2% (2 of 38 patients). One leak was controlled with reoperation, and the other was stopped with a lumbar drain (LD). The significance of pathology, type of approach, exposure of the ventricular system, use of fat graft, use of nasoseptal (NS) flap, and use of lumbar drain (LD) was examined, and none of these were significant predictors of postoperative CSF leak. CONCLUSIONS Gasket seal closure is a reliable long-term effective method for achieving watertight closure of the cranial base. It can be used in association with an intracranial fat graft, NS flap, LD, and tissue sealants. In this series, none of these other factors were significant predictors of postoperative CSF leak.","Garcia-Navarro, Victor; Anand, Vijay K; Schwartz, Theodore H",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2011.08.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22120292/,311

The aim of the present study was to determine whether there is a correlation between sarcopenia and the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative treatment. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of consecutive naive patients with HCC who underwent curative resection or radiofrequency ablation. To eliminate the influence of cause or the severity of liver damage, subjects were limited to those with HCC with hepatitis C-related cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class A liver function. Patients were assessed using computed tomographic measurement of muscle mass at the level of the third lumbar (L3) vertebrae, the L3 skeletal muscle index (L3 SMI). Sarcopenia was defined by using previously published, sex-specific cut-off value. RESULTS Sarcopenia was present in 61 of 92 patients. Patients' median age was 71.5 years (range, 47-84), and the baseline characteristics of patients were comparable between patients with and without sarcopenia except for sex, serum albumin level, prothrombin time, diabetes mellitus and body mass index. Recurrence rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 39.1%,77.1%,81.7% for patients with sarcopenia and 23.5%,59.5% and 75.7% for patients without sarcopenia, respectively (P = 0.03). Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that sarcopenia and preoperative α-fetoprotein of more than 40 ng/mL were significant independent factors for recurrence. CONCLUSION Sarcopenia is a risk factor for recurrence in patients with HCC who were treated with curative treatment.","Kamachi, Saori; Mizuta, Toshihiko; Otsuka, Taiga; Nakashita, Shunya; Ide, Yasushi; Miyoshi, Atsushi; Kitahara, Kenji; Eguchi, Yuichiro; Ozaki, Iwata; Anzai, Keizo",Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/hepr.12562; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26223826/,311

METHODS Eight consecutive patients (6 men; mean age 57.4 years, range 34-78 years) with acute thrombotic occlusion of the IVC in the presence of an IVC filter underwent percutaneous venous thrombectomy using the Trellis-8 thrombectomy system and adjunctive techniques between January 2009 and November 2013. Demographics, clinical data, procedures, and outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. All patients had clinical signs of lower extremity venous hypertension on presentation. The median time between IVC filter placement and occlusion was 25 months. Patients were followed for the development of thromboembolic complications to the last clinic visit or until they died. RESULTS The procedure was technically successful in 6 patients, whereas it could not be performed in 2 due to failure to cross the occlusion. The median follow-up period was 7.8 months, at which time all patients undergoing successful Trellis-8 thrombectomy had relief of symptoms without thromboembolic or bleeding complications. CONCLUSION In this limited performance and safety evaluation, the Trellis-8 thrombectomy system combined with adjunctive therapies, such as mechanical thrombectomy and balloon angioplasty, was effective in 75% of patients with IVC filter-related acute caval occlusion.","Branco, Bernardino C; Montero-Baker, Miguel F; Espinoza, Eduardo; Gamero, Maite; Zea, Rodrigo; Labropoulos, Nicos; Leon, Luis R",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602814564369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25775688/,311

MERS-CoV infection failed to elicit robust IFN response, suggesting that the virus might have evolved strategies to evade host innate immune surveillance. In this study, we identified and characterized type I IFN antagonism of MERS-CoV open reading frame (ORF) 8b accessory protein. ORF8b was abundantly expressed in MERS-CoV-infected Huh-7 cells. When ectopically expressed, ORF8b inhibited IRF3-mediated IFN-β expression induced by Sendai virus and poly(I:C). ORF8b was found to act at a step upstream of IRF3 to impede the interaction between IRF3 kinase IKKε and chaperone protein HSP70, which is required for the activation of IKKε and IRF3. An infection study using recombinant wild-type and ORF8b-deficient MERS-CoV further confirmed the suppressive role of ORF8b in type I IFN induction and its disruption of the colocalization of HSP70 with IKKε. Ectopic expression of HSP70 relieved suppression of IFN-β expression by ORF8b in an IKKε-dependent manner. Enhancement of IFN-β induction in cells infected with ORF8b-deficient virus was erased when HSP70 was depleted. Taken together, HSP70 chaperone is important for IKKε activation, and MERS-CoV ORF8b suppresses type I IFN expression by competing with IKKε for interaction with HSP70.","Wong, Lok-Yin Roy; Ye, Zi-Wei; Lui, Pak-Yin; Zheng, Xuyang; Yuan, Shuofeng; Zhu, Lin; Fung, Sin-Yee; Yuen, Kit-San; Siu, Kam-Leung; Yeung, Man-Lung; Cai, Zongwei; Woo, Patrick Chiu-Yat; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Chan, Chi-Ping; Jin, Dong-Yan",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1901489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747502/,311

METHODS 97 adults (77% female) completed a 3-day WDR with a 24-h urine collection on day 3, followed by at least one 24HDR with myfood24-Germany (corresponding to day 3 of the WDR). Intake of energy and 32 nutrients assessed by myfood24-Germany and the WDR for the same day were compared (method comparison). Intakes of protein and potassium assessed by myfood24-Germany/WDR were compared with intake estimated from urinary biomarkers for protein and potassium (biomarker comparison). RESULTS In the method comparison, significant correlations were found for energy and all tested nutrients (range 0.45-0.87). There was no significant difference between both methods in the assessed mean energy and macronutrient intake. However, myfood24-Germany underestimated mean intake of 15 nutrients. In the biomarker comparison, protein intake reported by myfood24-Germany/WDR was on average 10%/8% lower than estimated by biomarker. There was no significant difference in mean potassium intake assessed by myfood24-Germany/WDR and biomarker. However, a shared bias in the assessment of potassium intake was observed for both instruments. Concordance correlation coefficients (pc) and weighted Kappa coefficients (κ) confirmed good agreement with the biomarker estimates for myfood24-Germany/WDR in case of protein (pc = 0.58/0.66, κ = 0.51/0.53) and moderate agreement in case of potassium (pc = 0.44/0.51; κ = 0.30/0.33).

She had a right DCR 14 years earlier. Her relatively young age of presentation prompted suspicion of secondary nasolacrimal duct obstruction and, although the left lacrimal sac appeared macroscopically normal peroperatively, a lacrimal sac biopsy was taken. Histopathology revealed florid chronic inflammation, with abundant granular brown pigment and polarisable crystals suggestive of an exogenous material in the lacrimal sac mucosa compatible with mascara. After initial improvement, her epiphora has recurred 1-year postoperatively, but her ocular discharge has resolved. Mascara-induced conjunctival pigmentation is well established. However, there are very few published reports of nasolacrimal duct obstruction due to mascara. Since cosmetic application of mascara and kohl eyeliner is widespread, patients and practitioners should be aware of their potential to migrate into the lacrimal apparatus and cause chronic inflammation with secondary nasolacrimal duct obstruction.","Scollo, Paolo; Davies, Rhys; O'Donovan, Dominic; Rene, Cornelius",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2020-240942; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33962923/,311

METHODS Two hundred two patients were enrolled across 14 centers in Europe, Canada, and Australia. The following time intervals were measured: stroke onset to hospital arrival, hospital arrival to baseline imaging, baseline imaging to groin puncture, groin puncture to first stent deployment, and first stent deployment to reperfusion. Effects of time of day, general anesthesia use, and multimodal imaging on workflow were evaluated. Patient characteristics and workflow processes associated with prolonged interval times and good clinical outcome (90-day modified Rankin score, 0-2) were analyzed. RESULTS Median times were onset of stroke to hospital arrival, 123 minutes (interquartile range, 163 minutes); hospital arrival to thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) 2b/3 or final digital subtraction angiography, 133 minutes (interquartile range, 99 minutes); and baseline imaging to groin puncture, 86 minutes (interquartile range, 24 minutes). Time from baseline imaging to puncture was prolonged in patients receiving intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (32-minute mean delay) and when magnetic resonance-based imaging at baseline was used (18-minute mean delay). Extracranial carotid disease delayed puncture to first stent deployment time on average by 25 minutes. For each 1-hour increase in stroke onset to final digital subtraction angiography (or TICI 2b/3) time, odds of good clinical outcome decreased by 38%. CONCLUSIONS Interval times in the STAR study reflect current intra-arterial therapy for patients with acute ischemic stroke. Improving workflow metrics can further improve clinical outcome.

72426,"A Randomized, Double-blind, Non-inferiority Trial of Magnesium Sulphate versus Dexamethasone for Prevention of Postoperative Sore Throat after Lumbar Spinal Surgery in the Prone Position.",2015,"INTRODUCTION Delayed diagnosis of intraabdominal pathology in the intensive care unit (ICU) increases rates of morbidity and mortality. Intraabdominal pathologies are usually identified through presenting symptoms, clinical signs, and laboratory and radiological results; however, these could also delay diagnosis because of inconclusive laboratory tests or imaging results, or the inability to safely transfer a patient to the radiology room. In the current study we evaluated the safety and accuracy of bedside diagnostic laparoscopy to confirm the presence of intraabdominal pathology in an ICU setting. METHODS This retrospective study, carried out between January 2006 and June 2008, evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of bedside diagnostic laparoscopy performed on patients with a suspicion of ongoing intraabdominal pathology. Clinical indications for bedside diagnostic laparoscopy were: ultrasonography (US) images of gallbladder distension or wall thickening of more than 3 to 4 mm, with or without pericholecystic fluid; elevation of laboratory tests (bilirubin, transaminases, myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, gamma-glutamyltransferase); high level of lactate/metabolic acidosis; CT images inconclusive for intraabdominal pathology; or inability to perform a CT scan. Patients did not undergo bedside diagnostic laparoscopy if they presented clear indications for open surgery, coagulopathy, abdominal wall infection or high intraabdominal pressure. RESULTS Thirty-two patients underwent bedside diagnostic laparoscopy (Visiport Plus, Autosuture, US), 14 of whom had been admitted to the ICU for major trauma, 12 for sepsis of unknown origin and 6 for complications after cardiac surgery. The procedure was performed on an average of eight days after ICU admission (95% confidence interval = 5 to 15 days) and mean procedure duration was 40 minutes. None of the procedures resulted in complications. Bedside diagnostic laparoscopy was diagnostic for intraabdominal pathology in 15 patients, who subsequently underwent surgery, except in two cases of diffuse gut hypoperfusion. Diagnosis of cholecystitis was obtained in seven cases: two were treated with laparotomic cholecystectomy and five with percutaneous gallbladder drainage positioning. CONCLUSIONS Bedside diagnostic laparoscopy represents a safe and accurate technique for diagnosing intraabdominal pathology in an ICU setting and should be taken into consideration when patient transfer to radiology or the operating room is considered unsafe, or when routine radiological examinations are not conclusive enough to reach a definite diagnosis.","Peris, Adriano; Matano, Stefania; Manca, Giuseppe; Zagli, Giovanni; Bonizzoli, Manuela; Cianchi, Giovanni; Pasquini, Andrea; Batacchi, Stefano; Di Filippo, Alessandro; Anichini, Valentina; Nicoletti, Paola; Benemei, Silvia; Geppetti, Pierangelo",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/cc7730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19243621/,311

PATIENTS AND METHODS Between March 2000 and December 2007, 1000 consecutive patients with clinical stage T < or = 3aN0M0 prostate cancer underwent LRP, either supervised (17%) or performed (83%), by one surgeon. The median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 7.0 (1-50) ng/mL and median Gleason sum 6 (4-10); the clinical stage was T1 in 46.9%, T2 in 49.8% and T3 in 3.3%. RESULTS The median (range) operative duration was 177 (78-600) min. There was one conversion (patient 8) to open surgery. The median blood loss was 200 (10-1300) mL and four patients were transfused (0.4%). The median postoperative hospital stay was 3.0 (3-28) nights. The median catheterization time was 10.0 (0.8-120) days. There were 48 complications (4.8%) requiring surgical intervention in 33 (3.3%) patients, 58% of these as a day-case admission. The positive margin rates according to d'Amico risk groups were: low, 9.1%; intermediate, 20.3%; and high, 36.8%. The overall positive margin rate was 13.3%. The PSA level was < or =0.1 mg/L at 3 months in 99.1% of patients. At a mean follow-up of 27.7 (3-72) months, 96.1% of patients were free of biochemical recurrence. In patients with a follow-up of > or =24 months potency rates peaked in the series at 86% for all men and 94% for men aged < or =65 years, and continence rates at 98% before declining thereafter in men with a shorter follow-up. CONCLUSION The learning curve for operating time and blood loss was overcome within the first 100-150 cases, but complication and continence rates took 150-200 cases to reach a plateau. The longest learning curve was for potency, which did not stabilize until 700 cases. These learning curves are likely to be considerably shorter when surgeons are taught in departments with a high throughput of cases but both surgeons and patients should be aware of them. In view of these findings, the authors recommend that LRP should not be self-taught and should be learned within an immersion teaching programme. Even then, a large surgical volume is likely to be needed to maintain clinical outcomes at the highest level.","Eden, Christopher G; Neill, Mischel G; Louie-Johnsun, Mark W",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2008.08169.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19021612/,311

In the present study, it was attempted to investigate the conservative pollution transport at channel confluence by operating a series of experiments in the laboratory flume. In the designed laboratory model, two branches, with different widths of 45, 25 cm, were intersected and a channel confluence was created. Five entrance discharges and three initial contaminant concentrations, introduced using a linear feeder, were chosen as experimental variables. Conservative tracer of sodium chloride solution was used, and the electrical conductivities were measured at eight locations of the main channel and upstream branches with 2 seconds interval. Junction zone was assumed as a control volume, and by applying mass equilibrium to it, a new mathematical model was extracted. It was observed that there is concentration fluctuation in the falling limbs of the experimental breakthrough curves of the junction zone; however, it was diminished by downstream motion. Moreover, the observed pollution graphs had double peak points which changed to a single point with an increase of distance from the confluence position. Operation of the presented model was investigated by variation of its parameters. It was found that the contaminant residence time parameters of the confluence zone have the most significant influence in the simulation of the analytical model. Additionally, it was observed that the values of Gaussian distribution of the upstream branches could displace the position of pulses of resultant breakthrough curves or can overlap them. Moreover, the model performance was examined using statistical goodness of fit parameters like Nash-Sutcliffe, R2, and mean absolute error (MAE). Their values were calculated as 0.88, 0.91, 66.88 (ppm), respectively.","Chabokpour, Jafar; Azamathulla, Hazi Md; Azhdan, Yaghoub; Ziaei, Milad",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2020.472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263584/,311

Recently, a flurry of individual case reports on oral manifestation of Covid 19 including, ulceration, blistering lesions and stomatitis were published. However, it is not clear whether the oral presentations that are not unique to the virus are indeed related to the virus and appear at a higher prevalence than in the general population. We used the i2b2 platform of hospital patient's registry to determine the odds ratio for Covid 19 in patients that were diagnosed with recurrent aphthous stomatitis, an entity restricted to the oral cavity. The overall odds ratio for Covid 19 in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis before adjustments was 14 and after adjustment for gender, race and age 13.9, 6.5 and 2.93 respectively.

Although it is widely recognized that the crystalline structure of a cathode material largely dictates its electrochemical properties (e.g. capacity, cycle life and rate capabilities), this intrinsic connection in LiFePO4 has not been systematically reviewed. Different from the previous reviews, which mainly focus on the improvement of electrochemical performance by all kinds of techniques, in this review, the relationship between its electrochemical performance and bulk/surface structure is reviewed and discussed. First, it is revealed that the intra-particle Li+ transfer is influenced by several properties of the bulk, including crystalline structures, antisite defects and electronic structures. Next, it is demonstrated that the surface/interfacial structures of LiFePO4, which can be reconstructed artificially or spontaneously, also have great impacts on the performances. Lastly, the intrinsic connection between the structure and performance is preliminarily established, showing brand-new perspectives on the strategy for further improvement and contributing to a comprehensive understanding of LiFePO4.","Hu, Jiangtao; Huang, Weiyuan; Yang, Luyi; Pan, Feng",Nanoscale,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0nr03776a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647852/,311

METHODS This study encompasses 30 patients admitted for elective EVAR (27 men and 3 women). Two expert readers (vascular radiologist and vascular surgeon) reviewed CTA images in consensus and chose the proper endograft for each patient. Subsequently, a vascular radiologist and a resident radiologist (observer 1 and 2) reviewed CTA and NC-MRI examinations in a double-blind way and completed standard measurements. The interobserver and intermodality agreement was calculated by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Furthermore, the correlation between the endograft size chosen by the first pair and the second pair of observers was evaluated. RESULTS Concerning all measurements, no significant difference was found. Both CTA and NC-MRI angiographic measurements showed strong correlation. Interobserver ICCs for CTA and NC-MRI showed ranges of 0.62 to 0.99 (mean: 0.92) and 0.56 to 0.99 (mean: 0.91); intermodality ICCs for observer 1 and 2 showed ranges of 0.64 to 0.99 (mean: 0.92) and 0.56 to 0.99 (mean: 0.92). The CTA and NC-MRI vascular measurements correlated strongly, except for both external iliac artery diameters. The choice of stent size was always the same between the 2 observers; furthermore, graft size was always in agreement with that selected prospectively. CONCLUSION Computed tomography angiography remains the standard of reference for EVAR planning; NC-MRI can be an option for patients with contraindications for CTA, in particular those with renal impairment.","Piacentino, Filippo; Fontana, Federico; Micieli, Camilla; Angeretti, Maria G; Cardim, Larissa Nocchi; Coppola, Andrea; Molinelli, Valeria; Piffaretti, Gabriele; Novario, Raffaele; Fugazzola, Carlo",Vascular and endovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1538574417740508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29162027/,311

BACKGROUND ISR CTOs are a challenge in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Although they can be treated by ELCA, limited data are available on the effects of ELCA treatment in these patients. METHODS Fifty-nine consecutive patients underwent PCI for ISR CTOs at Beijing Hospital between December 2017 and September 2020. According to whether or not ELCA was performed, they were divided into two groups. Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) analyses were performed routinely, including measurement of the minimal lumen diameter and calculation of the percentage diameter stenosis. The procedural success rate, the frequency of peri-procedural complications, and the incidence rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) over nine months were assessed. The primary endpoint in the study was the percentage diameter stenosis. RESULTS Procedure success was achieved in most patients in both groups (75.9%). Patients in the ELCA group exhibited a lower percentage diameter stenosis (24.5 ± 9.09 vs. 35.1 ± 18.6, p = 0.048) and a larger minimal lumen diameter (2.36 ± 0.29 mm vs. 1.78 ± 0.64 mm, p < 0.001) than those in the control group and the 9-month incidence rates of MACEs did not differ (9.5% vs 15.8%, p = 0.699). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that ELCA may be a safe and effective technique in the treatment of ISR CTOs, and the use of ELCA can achieve good immediate angiographic results, as measured by QCA, without increasing peri-procedural complications or the incidence rates of 9-month MACEs.","Li, Hui; Ai, Hu; Li, Le; Zheng, Naixin; Tang, Guodong; Yang, Guojian; Zhao, Ying; Sun, Fucheng; Zhang, Huiping",BMC cardiovascular disorders,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12872-021-02208-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407770/,311
75401,﻿Bleaching sensitivity with a desensitizing in-office bleaching gel: a randomized ﻿double-blind clinical trial.,2020-09-08,"Lower and upper limb maximum muscular force development is an important indicator of physical capacity. Manual muscle testing, load cell coupled with a signal conditioner, and handheld dynamometry are three widely used techniques for measuring isometric muscle strength. Recently, there is a proliferation of low-cost tools that have potential to be used to measure muscle strength. This study examined both the criterion validity, inter-day reliability and intra-day reliability of a microcontroller-based load cell amplifier for quantifying muscle strength. To do so, a low-cost microcontroller-based load cell amplifier for measuring lower and upper limb maximal voluntary isometric muscular force was compared to a commercial grade signal conditioner and to a handheld dynamometer. The results showed that the microcontroller-based load cell amplifier correlated nearly perfectly (Pearson's R-values between 0.947 to 0.992) with the commercial signal conditioner and the handheld dynamometer, and showed good to excellent association when calculating ICC scores, with values of 0.9582 [95% C.I.: 0.9297-0.9752] for inter-day reliability and of 0.9269 [95% C.I.: 0.8909-0.9533] for session one, intra-day reliability. Such results may have implications for how the evaluation of muscle strength measurement is conducted in the future, particularly for offering a commercial-like grade quality, low cost, portable and flexible option.","Gaudet, Julie; Handrigan, Grant",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20174999; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899264/,311

76236,Basics of continuous renal replacement therapy in pediatrics.,2019,"BACKGROUND Thousands of children require mechanical ventilation each year. Although mechanical ventilation is lifesaving, it is also associated with adverse events if not properly managed. The systematic implementation of evidence-based practice through the use of guidelines and protocols has been shown to mitigate risk, yet variation in care remains prevalent. Advances in health-care technology provided the ability to stream data about mechanical ventilation and therapeutic response. Through these advances, a computer system was developed to enable the coupling of physiologic and ventilation data for real-time interpretation. Our aim was to assess the feasibility and utility of a newly developed patient categorization and scoring system to objectively measure compliance with standards of care. METHODS We retrospectively categorized the ventilation and oxygenation statuses of subjects within our pediatric ICU utilizing 15 rules-based algorithms. Targets were predetermined based on generally accepted practices. All patient categories were calculated and presented as a percent score (0-100%) of acceptable ventilation, acceptable oxygenation, barotrauma-free, and volutrauma-free states. RESULTS Two hundred twenty-two subjects were identified and analyzed encompassing 1,578 d of mechanical ventilation. Median age was 3 y, median ideal body weight was 14.7 kg, and 63% were male. The median acceptable ventilation score was 84.6%, and the median acceptable oxygenation score was 70.1% (100% being maximally acceptable). Potential for ventilator-induced lung injury was broken into 2 components: barotrauma and volutrauma. There was very little potential for barotrauma, with a median barotrauma-free state of 100%. Median potential for a volutrauma-free state was 56.1%. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate the first patient categorization system utilizing a coordinated data-banking system and analytics to determine patient status and a surveillance of mechanical ventilation quality. Further research is needed to determine whether interventions such as visual display of variance from goal and patient categorization summaries can improve outcomes.

To avoid unnecessarily large incisions is now feasible for such retrieval surgery. We report herein a case of a patient who underwent retrieval surgery with a single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) to minimize surgical incision. Our case concerns a 72-year-old female with a 3 cm length needle incidentally discovered as a peritoneal foreign body without any apparent symptoms. Retrieval was performed safely with SILS port inserted through a 2.5 cm transverse incision below the umbilicus. Two flexible forceps introduced through the SILS port offer easy operation for retrieving foreign bodies even if dissection or other surgical maneuvers are required. Our technique of abdominal foreign body retrieval with the SILS port is a useful clinical application of minimally invasive surgery for such cases.,"Hara, Masayasu; Takayama, Satoru; Imafuji, Hiroyuki; Sato, Mikinori; Funahashi, Hitoshi; Takeyama, Hiromitsu","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e31820df9d0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21654283/,311

Laparo-endoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) may diminish morbidity of laparoscopic surgery. We prospectively evaluated feasibility and outcomes of LESS-Radical Nephrectomy (LESS-RN) and Partial Nephrectomy (LESS-PN). Methods. 10 patients underwent LESS-RN (6) and LESS-PN (4) between 2/2009-5/2009. LESS-RN included 2 with renal vein thrombectomy, one of which was also cytoreductive. Transperitoneal LESS access was obtained by periumbilical incision. Patient/tumor characteristics, oncologic, and quality of life (QoL) outcomes were analyzed. Results. 3 Men/7 Women (mean age 58.7 years, median follow-up 9.8 months) underwent LESS. 9/10 cases were completed successfully. All had negative margins. Mean operative time was 161 minutes, estimated blood loss was 125 mL, and incision size was 4.4 cm. Median tumor size for LESS-RN and -PN was 5.0 and 1.7 cm (P = .045). Median LESS-PN ischemia time was 24 minutes; mean preoperative/postoperative creatinine were 0.7/0.8 mg/dL (P = .19). Mean pain score at discharge was 1.3. Mean preoperative, 3-, and 6-month postoperative SF-36 QoL Score was 73.8, 74.4 and 77.1 (P = .222). All patients are currently alive. Conclusions. LESS-RN, renal vein thrombectomy, and PN are technically feasible and safe while maintaining adherence to oncologic principles, with excellent QoL preservation and low discharge pain scores.

Although the essential role of sleep in healing has long been recognized, excessive noise in hospital environments remains a persistent and pervasive problem. For hospitalized patients, environmental noise can result in sleep deprivation and adverse health outcomes; not surprisingly, hospital noise ranks as a major patient complaint. At a small suburban community hospital, patients responding to a quiet-at-night question in the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey gave the hospital's telemetry unit the lowest possible score: 1 out of 5 points. In response, the unit's quality improvement team, coordinated by a clinical nurse leader, introduced a holistic ""sleep menu"" intervention. The multicomponent intervention subsequently improved patients' care experience and staff engagement. The percentage of patients who self-reported five or more hours of uninterrupted sleep rose from 31% at baseline to 80% during the intervention. This improvement was sustained over the three-month intervention period and led to a quiet-at-night HCAHPS score of 4. The sleep menu initiative resulted in substantial benefits that optimized both patient and organizational outcomes.","Antonio, Christian Karl",The American journal of nursing,https://doi.org/10.1097/01.naj.0000718660.44502.86; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32976158/,311

The levels of serum Slit2 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the expression of Slit2 in renal tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry. Patients with active disease had higher levels of serum Slit2 than patients with inactive disease and controls. Patients with sole skin impairment or sole renal impairment or both skin and renal impairment had higher levels of serum Slit2 than patients with neither skin nor renal impairment. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) had higher levels of serum Slit2 than patients with no CKD. Levels of serum Slit2 in patients with active disease were positively correlated with the SLE Disease Activity Index, complement C4, and anti-dsDNA antibody. Levels of serum Slit2 in patients with CKD were positively correlated with serum creatinine, urine protein, and glomerular filtration rate. The expression of Slit2 and its receptor Roundabout1 (Robo1) in the renal tissue of patients with lupus nephritis were higher than controls. Moreover, renal Slit2 was positively correlated with renal chronic index.

81957,"Clinical characteristics of 132 healthcare workers cases with COVID-19: a retrospective study from a single center in Wuhan, China.",2020-09-14,"BACKGROUND Electronic health (eHealth) is a rapidly evolving field informed by multiple scientific disciplines. Because of this, the use of different terms and concepts to explain the same phenomena and lack of standardization in reporting interventions often leaves a gap that hinders knowledge accumulation. Interventions focused on self-management support of cardiovascular diseases through the use of remote monitoring technologies are a cross-disciplinary area potentially affected by this gap. A review of the underlying frameworks, models, and theories that have informed projects at this crossroad could advance future research and development efforts. OBJECTIVE This research aimed to identify and compare underlying approaches that have informed interventions focused on self-management support of cardiovascular diseases through the use of remote monitoring technologies. The objective was to achieve an understanding of the distinct approaches by highlighting common or conflicting principles, guidelines, and methods. METHODS The metaethnography approach was used to review and synthesize researchers' reports on how they applied frameworks, models, and theories in their projects. Literature was systematically searched in 7 databases: Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, and Cochrane Library. Included studies were thoroughly read and coded to extract data for the synthesis. Studies were mainly related by the key ingredients of the underlying approaches they applied. The key ingredients were finally translated across studies and synthesized into thematic clusters. RESULTS Of 1224 initial results, 17 articles were included. The articles described research and development of 10 different projects. Frameworks, models, and theories (n=43) applied by the projects were identified. Key ingredients (n=293) of the included articles were mapped to the following themes of eHealth development: (1) it is a participatory process; (2) it creates new infrastructures for improving health care, health, and well-being; (3) it is intertwined with implementation; (4) it integrates theory, evidence, and participatory approaches for persuasive design; (5) it requires continuous evaluation cycles; (6) it targets behavior change; (7) it targets technology adoption; and (8) it targets health-related outcomes. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this review support and exemplify the numerous possibilities in the use of frameworks, models, and theories to guide research and development of eHealth. Participatory, user-centered design, and integration with empirical evidence and theoretical modeling were widely identified principles in the literature. On the contrary, less attention has been given to the integration of implementation in the development process and supporting novel eHealth-based health care infrastructures. To better integrate theory and evidence, holistic approaches can combine patient-centered studies with consolidated knowledge from expert-based approaches.

Their mechanism of action involves a temporary and superficial plugging of eccrine sweat pores at the skin surface. We developed a microfluidic system that allows the real time observation of the interactions between sweat and ACH in conditions mimicking physiological sweat flow and pore dimensions. Using artificial sweat containing bovine serum albumin as a model protein, we performed experiments under flowing conditions to demonstrate that pore clogging results from the aggregation of proteins by aluminium polycations at specific location in the sweat pore. Combining microfluidic experiments, confocal microscopy and numerical models helps to better understand the physical chemistry and mechanisms involved in pore plugging. The results show that plugging starts from the walls of sweat pores before expanding into the centre of the channel. The simulations aid in explaining the influence of ACH concentration as well as the impact of flow conditions on the localization of the plug. Altogether, these results outline the potential of both microfluidic confocal observations and numerical simulations at the single sweat pore level to understand why aluminium polycations are so efficient for sweat channel plugging.","Sakhawoth, Yasine; Dupire, Jules; Leonforte, Fabien; Chardon, Marion; Monti, Fabrice; Tabeling, Patrick; Cabane, Bernard; Botet, Robert; Galey, Jean-Baptiste",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85691-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737654/,311

Gag proteins, encoded by retroviruses, orchestrate the assembly of virus particles in close collaboration with host cell machinery. The earliest steps in retrovirus assembly-those immediately following synthesis of Gag on cytosolic ribosomes-are poorly understood. Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) offers a unique model system for dissecting these early steps because the RSV Gag protein undergoes transient nuclear trafficking prior to plasma membrane transport. Other Gag proteins, including those of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), murine leukemia virus (MLV), foamy virus and retrotransposons in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Drosophila, have also been detected in the nucleus, suggesting that nuclear trafficking of Gag proteins is a common property of retroviruses and retrotransposons. In addition to retroviruses, many structural proteins of unrelated viruses, including influenza M1, NEP and NP proteins,38 Borna disease virus N and P proteins28,56 and coronavirus N protein,23,57 undergo nuclear localization and bind viral RNAs to form viral ribonuclear protein (RNP) complexes that are exported from the nucleus for packaging into virus particles. Similarly, nuclear trafficking of the RSV Gag protein is required for efficient encapsidation of the viral genomic RNA (gRNA) into assembling virus particles.19 Recently, we reported that the viral RNA itself appears to be a key factor in controlling the nucleus/cytosol distribution of RSV Gag.22 Our data demonstrate that binding of RSV RNA to the Gag protein promotes Gag-CRM1-RanGTP binding, resulting in export of the retroviral RNP from the nucleus. We propose that association of the viral RNA induces a conformational change in Gag that reveals its nuclear export signal (NES) and prepares that complex for its journey to the plasma membrane for budding. This work challenges existing dogmas regarding the molecular basis of Gag-mediated selection of gRNA for packaging and may lead to novel paradigms for the mechanism of retroviral genome encapsidation.","Parent, Leslie J",Nucleus,https://doi.org/10.4161/nucl.2.2.15018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21738831/,311
83543,Changes in salivary physiological stress markers induced by muscle stretching in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.,2008,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE A new clinical construct termed embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) was recently introduced, but no such population has been described yet. Our aim is to provide a detailed descriptive analysis of an ESUS population derived from a large prospective ischemic stroke registry using the proposed diagnostic criteria. METHODS The criteria proposed by the Cryptogenic Stroke/ESUS International Working Group were applied to the Athens Stroke Registry to identify all ESUS patients. ESUS was defined as a radiologically confirmed nonlacunar brain infarct in the absence of (a) extracranial or intracranial atherosclerosis causing ≥50% luminal stenosis in arteries supplying the ischemic area, (b) major-risk cardioembolic source, and (c) any other specific cause of stroke. RESULTS Among 2735 patients admitted between 1992 and 2011, 275 (10.0%) were classified as ESUS. In the majority of ESUS (74.2%), symptoms were maximal at onset. ESUS were of moderate severity (median National Institute Health Stroke Scale score, 5). The most prevalent risk factor was arterial hypertension (64.7%), and 50.9% of patients were dyslipidemic. Among potential causes of the ESUS, covert atrial fibrillation (AF) was the most prevalent: in 30 (10.9%) patients, AF was diagnosed during hospitalization for stroke recurrence, whereas in 50 (18.2%) patients AF was detected after repeated ECG monitoring during follow-up. Also, covert AF was strongly suggested in 38 patients (13.8%) but never recorded. CONCLUSIONS About 10% of patients with first-ever ischemic stroke met criteria for ESUS; covert paroxysmal AF seems to be a frequent cause of ESUS.","Ntaios, George; Papavasileiou, Vasileios; Milionis, Haralambos; Makaritsis, Konstantinos; Manios, Efstathios; Spengos, Konstantinos; Michel, Patrik; Vemmos, Konstantinos",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.114.007240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25378429/,311
83755,Accuracy and precision of continuous noninvasive arterial pressure monitoring compared with invasive arterial pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2014,"BACKGROUND The Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected surgical practice around the world. While several abdominal emergencies can be managed effectively and safely using minimally invasive surgery (MIS), the safety of using MIS amid the COVID-19 pandemic has been debated. MIS, including laparoscopy and robotic surgery, is considered an aerosol-generating procedure and some recent research demonstrated possible spread of the virus through aerosol. This review assessed the available evidence on the safety of MIS in the COVID-19 era, explored the possible precautions to be taken when using MIS to prevent exposure of the operating team to infection, and highlighted the recommendations of several surgical societies in this regard. MATERIAL AND METHODS Electronic databases, Google Scholar, and pre-print archives were searched for evidence on airborne transmission of COVID-19 and the safety of MIS amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Recommendations of recognized surgical societies were also searched. The available evidence was summarized in a narrative manner. RESULTS Limited data on the possibility of airborne transmission of COVID-19 were found. The studies that reported on the presence of the SARS-COV-2 in the air samples of patients with COVID-19 had conflicting results. Several precautions to minimize the presumed risk of exposure of the operation room staff to COVID-19 were devised. CONCLUSION According to the available evidence and recommendations of different surgical societies, MIS may be used in the treatment of acute abdominal emergency. However, considerable caution should be taken to avoid the presumed risk of aerosolization of the virus particles during the procedure, which may expose the operating staff to the risk of COVID-19.","Emile, Sameh Hany; Hamid, Hytham K S",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/13645706.2020.1838549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33107358/,311

85315,Hemodynamic outcomes of the Ross procedure versus other aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2018,"OBJECTIVES A resurgence of pertussis or whooping cough has been observed worldwide despite broad vaccination coverage. Pertussis like illness (PLI) refers to a clinical syndrome compatible with pertussis infection but lacking laboratory confirmation or an epidemiological link to a confirmed case. Our study aimed to estimate the contribution of Bordetella pertussis infection and identifying predictors of its diagnosis in a cohort of children with PLI. METHODS Demographic and clinical information were retrospectively collected from the medical records of children < 13 years old and hospitalized for PLI in two pediatric units in Oman from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2013. The laboratory data of all cases were reviewed and confirmed cases of pertussis were identified, analyzed, and compared with non-confirmed cases. RESULTS A total of 131 patients were enrolled in this study. The majority (95.4% [125/131]) were infants. Only 54.1% (71/131) of admitted children with PLI were tested for pertussis. The incidence of pertussis infection among the tested group was 16.9% (12/71) with a 95% confidence interval 8.2-25.6. Severe illness occurred in 56.4% (74/131) of patients, and six were confirmed to have pertussis. Pediatric intensive care unit admission was required for one confirmed case of pertussis and eight cases from the PLI group (three were negative for pertussis, and five were not tested). Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis revealed that a white blood cell count 3 23.5 × 109/L had 96.6% specificity and lymphocytes 3 17 × 109/L had 98.3% specificity. CONCLUSIONS Taking into consideration that the number tested for pertussis was limited, the incidence of pertussis was 16.9% (12 out of 71 patients). Lymphocytosis can be used as a reliable predictor for the diagnosis of pertussis especially in the absence of specific confirmatory tests or until their results are available.","Al Maani, Amal; Al Qayoudhi, Abdullah; Nazir, Hanan Fawzi; Omar, Heba; Al Jardani, Amina; Al Muharrmi, Zakariya; Wali, Yasser",Oman medical journal,https://doi.org/10.5001/omj.2017.75; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29026471/,311
85778,Bivalved Versus Circumferential Cast Immobilization for Displaced Forearm Fractures: A Randomized Clinical Trial to Assess Efficacy and Safety.,2017,"Background Sentinel influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance is an essential component of a comprehensive influenza surveillance program. Community-based ILI surveillance systems that rely solely on sentinel healthcare practices omit important segments of the population, including those who do not seek medical care. Participatory surveillance, which relies on community participation in surveillance, may address some limitations of traditional ILI systems. Objective We aimed to evaluate FluWatchers, a crowdsourced ILI application developed to complement and complete ILI surveillance in Canada. Methods Using established frameworks for surveillance evaluations, we assessed the acceptability, reliability, accuracy and usefulness of the FluWatchers system 2015-2016, through 2018-2019. Evaluation indicators were compared against national surveillance indicators of ILI and of laboratory confirmed respiratory virus infections. Results The acceptability of FluWatchers was demonstrated by growth of 50%-100% in season-over-season participation, and a consistent season-over-season retention of 80%. Reliability was greater for FluWatchers than for our traditional ILI system, although both systems had week-over-week fluctuations in the number of participants responding. FluWatchers' ILI rates had moderate correlation with weekly influenza laboratory detection rates and other winter seasonal respiratory virus detections including respiratory syncytial virus and seasonal coronaviruses. Finally, FluWatchers has demonstrated its usefulness as a source of core FluWatch surveillance information and has the potential to fill data gaps in current programs for influenza surveillance and control. Conclusion FluWatchers is an example of an innovative digital participatory surveillance program that was created to address limitations of traditional ILI surveillance in Canada. It fulfills the surveillance system evaluation criteria of acceptability, reliability, accuracy and usefulness.","Lee, Liza; Desroches, Mireille; Mukhi, Shamir; Bancej, Christina",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,https://doi.org/10.14745/ccdr.v47i09a02; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34650332/,311
86413,Effect of Ivermectin on Time to Resolution of Symptoms Among Adults With Mild COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,2021-03-04,"BACKGROUND The amount of force applied on a device is an important measure to evaluate the endovascular and surgical device manipulations. The measure has not been evaluated for neuroenodvascular procedures. PURPOSE We aimed to study the use of force measure as a novel approach to test distal access catheter (DAC) performance during catheterization of cervical and intracranial vessels using patient specific 3-dimentional (3D) phantoms. METHODS Using patient specific 3D phantoms of the cervical and intracranial circulation, we recorded measure of force required to deliver three types of DACs beyond the ophthalmic segment of the internal carotid artery. Six different combinations of DAC-microcatheter-guidewire were tested. We intentionally included what we considered suboptimal combinations of DACs, microcatheters, and guidewires during our experiments to test the feasibility of measuring force under different conditions. A six axis force sensor was secured to the DAC with an adjustable torque used to track axially directed push and pull forces required to navigate the DAC to the target site. RESULTS In a total of 55 experiments, we found a significant difference in the amount of force used between different DACs (mean force for DAC A, 1.887±0.531N; for DAC B, 2.153±1.280 N; and for DAC C, 1.194±0.521 N, P=0.007). There was also a significant difference in force measures among the six different catheter systems (P=0.035). CONCLUSIONS Significant difference in the amount of force used between different DACs and catheter systems were recorded. Use of force measure in neuroendovascular procedures on 3D printed phantoms is feasible.","Mokin, Maxim; Waqas, Muhammad; Setlur Nagesh, Swetadri Vasan; Karkhanis, Nitant Vivek; Levy, Elad I; Ionita, Ciprian N; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2018-014468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30514736/,311

Smart soft tissue markers that translate the sensitivity of diagnostic imaging into optimal therapeutic intervention are therefore highly warranted. This paper presents a unique adaptable liquid soft tissue marker system based on functionalized carbohydrates (Carbo-gel). The liquid state of these markers allows for high-precision placement under image guidance using thin needles. Based on step-by-step modifications, the image features and mechanical properties of markers can be optimized to bridge diagnostic imaging and specific therapeutic interventions. The performance of Carbo-gel is demonstrated for markers that (i) have radiographic, magnetic resonance, and ultrasound visibility; (ii) are palpable and visible; and (iii) are localizable by near-infrared fluorescence and radio guidance. The study demonstrates encouraging proof of concept for the liquid marker system as a well-tolerated multimodal imaging marker that can improve image-guided radiotherapy and surgical interventions, including robotic surgery.","Hansen, Anders E; Henriksen, Jonas R; Jølck, Rasmus I; Fliedner, Frederikke P; Bruun, Linda M; Scherman, Jonas; Jensen, Andreas I; Munck Af Rosenschöld, Per; Moorman, Lilah; Kurbegovic, Sorel; de Blanck, Steen R; Larsen, Klaus R; Clementsen, Paul F; Christensen, Anders N; Clausen, Mads H; Wang, Wenbo; Kempen, Paul; Christensen, Merete; Viby, Niels-Erik; Persson, Gitte; Larsen, Rasmus; Conradsen, Knut; McEvoy, Fintan J; Kjaer, Andreas; Eriksen, Thomas; Andresen, Thomas L",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abb5353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32875113/,311
88259,Optimal Cerebral Perfusion Pressure Management at Bedside: A Single-Center Pilot Study.,2015,"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV; murine coronavirus [M-CoV]) causes meningoencephalitis, myelitis, and optic neuritis followed by axonal loss and demyelination. This murine virus is used as a common model to study both acute and chronic virus-induced demyelination in the central nervous system. Studies with recombinant MHV strains that differ in the gene encoding the spike protein have demonstrated that the spike has a role in both MHV pathogenesis and retrograde axonal transport. Fusion peptides (FPs) in the spike protein play a key role in MHV pathogenesis. In a previous study of the effect of deleting a single proline residue in the FP of a demyelinating MHV strain, we found that two central, consecutive prolines are important for cell-cell fusion and pathogenesis. The dihedral fluctuation of the FP was showed to be repressed whenever two consecutive prolines (PP) were present, in contrast to the presence of a single proline (P) in the chain. Using this proline-deleted MHV strain, here we investigated whether intracranial injection of this strain can induce optic neuritis by retrograde axonal transport from the brain to the retina through the optic nerve. We observed that the proline-deleted recombinant MHV strain is restricted to the optic nerve, is unable to translocate to the retina, and causes only minimal demyelination and no neuronal death. We conclude that an intact proline dyad in the FP of the recombinant demyelinating MHV strain plays a crucial role in translocation of the virus through axons and subsequent neurodegeneration.","Rout, Saurav Saswat; Singh, Manmeet; Shindler, Kenneth S; Das Sarma, Jayasri",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra119.011918; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32249210/,311
88788,Effects of therapeutic plasma exchange on anticoagulants in patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation: a systematic review.,2019,"OBJECTIVE The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide since December 2019. Neurological symptoms have been reported as part of the clinical spectrum of the disease. We aim to determine whether neurological manifestations are common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and to describe their main characteristics. METHODS We systematically review all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to hospital in a Spanish population during March 2020. Demographic characteristics, systemic and neurological clinical manifestations, and complementary tests were analyzed. RESULTS Of 841 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (mean age 66.4 years, 56.2% men) 57.4% developed some form of neurological symptom. Nonspecific symptoms such as myalgias (17.2%), headache (14.1%), and dizziness (6.1%) were present mostly in the early stages of infection. Anosmia (4.9%) and dysgeusia (6.2%) tended to occur early (60% as the first clinical manifestation) and were more frequent in less severe cases. Disorders of consciousness occurred commonly (19.6%), mostly in older patients and in severe and advanced COVID-19 stages. Myopathy (3.1%), dysautonomia (2.5%), cerebrovascular diseases (1.7%), seizures (0.7%), movement disorders (0.7%), encephalitis (n=1), Guillain-Barré syndrome (n=1), and optic neuritis (n=1) were also reported, but less frequent. Neurological complications were the main cause of death in 4.1% of all deceased study subjects. CONCLUSIONS Neurological manifestations are common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In our series, more than half of patients presented some form of neurological symptom. Clinicians need to maintain close neurological surveillance for prompt recognition of these complications. The investigation of the mechanisms and emerging consequences of SARS-CoV-2 neurological involvement require further studies.","Romero-Sánchez, Carlos Manuel; Díaz-Maroto, Inmaculada; Fernández-Díaz, Eva; Sánchez-Larsen, Álvaro; Layos-Romero, Almudena; García-García, Jorge; González, Esther; Redondo-Peñas, Inmaculada; Perona-Moratalla, Ana Belén; Del Valle-Pérez, José Antonio; Gracia-Gil, Julia; Rojas-Bartolomé, Laura; Feria-Vilar, Inmaculada; Monteagudo, María; Palao, María; Palazón-García, Elena; Alcahut-Rodríguez, Cristian; Sopelana-Garay, David; Moreno, Yóscar; Ahmad, Javaad; Segura, Tomás",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000009937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32482845/,311

The relationship of this phenomenon to the device and/or procedure remains unclear. The authors present the results of histopathological analyses of the brain sections from 3 patients in whom fatal ipsilateral intracerebral hemorrhages developed several days after uneventful PED treatment of supraclinoid aneurysms. METHODS Microscopic analyses revealed foreign material occluding small vessels within the hemorrhagic area in all patients. Further analyses of the embolic materials using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was conducted on specimens from 2 of the 3 patients. Although microscopically identical, the quantity of material recovered from the third patient was insufficient for FTIR spectroscopy. RESULTS FTIR spectroscopy showed that the foreign material was polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), a substance that is commonly used in the coatings of interventional devices. CONCLUSIONS These findings are suggestive of a potential association between intraprocedural foreign body emboli and post-PED treatment-delayed ipsilateral intraparenchymal hemorrhage.","Hu, Yin C; Deshmukh, Vivek R; Albuquerque, Felipe C; Fiorella, David; Nixon, Randal R; Heck, Donald V; Barnwell, Stanley L; McDougall, Cameron G",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2013.11.jns131599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24320006/,311

However, despite demonstrated utility, its somewhat amorphous identity leaves some scholars questioning just what it means to be biocultural. In this article, rather than providing proscriptive doctrine, we contribute to these conversations about the nature of biocultural anthropology by considering what biocultural research does. We begin with a consideration of some of the foundational themes of biocultural work including recognition of the dialectical nature of sociocultural and biological forces, interest in inequality, and incorporation of both evolutionary and political economic perspectives. To emphasize the consistency of biocultural work over time, we also trace these themes from originating work to their appearance in current research. We then identify some of the key actions of the biocultural approach, noting that biocultural work can execute any number though rarely all of these actions simultaneously. We then offer brief introductions to the articles that make up this special issue, highlighting the ways in which each piece undertakes key biocultural actions. Following these introductions, we provide a discussion of some of the types of biocultural work that are not present in this special issue, recognizing the breadth of biocultural research across multiple subfields of anthropology. Finally, we point to some potentially fruitful directions for future biocultural research. In the end, we conclude that while biocultural anthropology may not have a cohesive or set agenda, it does have a clear and recognizable form of content and methodology illuminated by its actions.","Hoke, Morgan K; Schell, Lawrence M",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.23471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32681558/,311

The aim of this study was to describe the association between nutritional risk and length of stay, days on mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality in patients infected with SARS-COV-2. METHODS a retrospective cohort of ventilated, critically ill patients. We assessed nutrition risk at baseline using NUTRIC-score. Logistic and linear regression models were used to analyze the association between NUTRIC-score and clinical outcomes (days on mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality). A survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS a total of 112 patients were included, 39.3 % were overweight and 47.3 % were obese. Based on NUTRIC-Score, 66 % and 34 % of patients were at high and low nutritional risk, respectively. High nutritional risk was associated with increased mortality risk (OR: 2.4, 95 % CI, 1.06-5.47, p = 0.036) and higher 28-day mortality (HR: 2.05, 95 % CI, 1.01-4.23, p = 0.04) in comparison with low risk. CONCLUSION high nutritional risk is related to mortality in SARS-COV-2 critically ill patients. Overweight and obesity are common in this sample.

METHODS Human embryonal carcinoma xenografts (six/rat) were untreated (controls) or treated to form mature teratomas with low-dose cisplatin and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) over a period of 8 weeks. In another group, necrosis was induced in xenografts with high-dose cisplatin plus etoposide (two cycles). (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) small animal positron emission tomography (SA PET) imaging was performed in three rats (one control and two treated for 4 and 8 weeks with cisplatin+ATRA). Imaging of α(v)β(3) expression was performed in six rats bearing mature teratomas and two rats with necrotic lesions on a microSPECT/CT device after injection of the tracer [(99m)Tc]HYNIC-RGD [6-hydrazinonicotinic acid conjugated to cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Lys)]. Correlative immunohistochemistry studies of human and mouse α(v)β(3) expression were performed. RESULTS Cisplatin+ATRA induced differentiation of the xenografts. After 8 weeks, some glandular structures and mesenchymal cells were visible; in contrast, control tumours showed undifferentiated tissues. SA PET imaging showed that mature teratoma had very low avidity for (18)F-FDG [mean standardised uptake value (SUV(mean)) = 0.48 ± 0.05] compared to untreated embryonal carcinoma (SUV(mean) = 0.92 ± 0.13) (p = 0.005). α(v)β(3) imaging accurately distinguished mature teratoma (tumour to muscle ratio = 4.29 ± 1.57) from necrosis (tumour to muscle ratio = 1.3 ± 0.26) (p = 0.0002). Immunohistochemistry studies showed that α(v)β(3) integrin expression was strong in the glandular structures of mature teratoma lesions and negative in host stroma.

We examined for differential patterns of outcome between China and non-China participants of the ENhanced Control of Hypertension And Thrombolysis strokE stuDy (ENCHANTED), which tested different alteplase doses in AIS. METHODS ENCHANTED was an international, multicentre, open, blinded-endpoint trial of the effects of low-dose (0.6 mg/kg) versus standard-dose (0.9 mg/kg) intravenous alteplase on 90-day disability outcomes and symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (sICH) in 3310 patients with AIS. RESULTS Participants (n=1419, 48%) in China were younger, and more often male, hypertensive and with prior stroke and coronary artery disease, but less likely to have atrial fibrillation and use antihypertensive, antithrombotic and lipid-lowering agents, compared with non-China patients with AIS. Although China participants had more AIS due to large artery occlusion, were treated later and had differing ancillary management, there was no significant difference in 90-day modified Rankin scale scores 2-6 (55.6% vs 47.8%; OR, adjusted for baseline and management factors 0.87 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.07; p=0.20)) and risk of sICH (Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke-Monitoring Study criteria: 1.4% vs 1.8%; p=0.12) compared with non-China participants. There was no heterogeneity in the treatment effects of low-dose versus standard-dose alteplase between China and non-China participants. CONCLUSION Patients with AIS recruited to the ENCHANTED trial in China had similar outcomes in response to thrombolysis treatment despite significantly differing demographic, clinical and management factors to patients with AIS in other regions.","Song, Lily; Wang, Xia; Robinson, Thompson; Lindley, Richard I; Arima, Hisatomi; Lavados, Pablo M; Chen, Xiaoying; Chalmers, John; Anderson, Craig S",Stroke and vascular neurology,https://doi.org/10.1136/svn-2017-000085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28959492/,311

Type I IFNs produced by the infected tissue also signal beyond the boundaries of the infection to regulate different elements of the anti-viral immune response. Recent reports show that type I IFNs directly condition naive monocytes residing in the distal bone marrow (BM) and induce the expression of effector molecules in memory T cells, before their recruitment to the infected site. In addition, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were shown to enter the cell cycle in response to systemically distributed type I IFNs. These discoveries expand our understanding of the pleiotropic effects of type I IFNs during infection and highlight the critical role of systemic signals in the development of an effective response to a localized viral infection.","López, Carolina B; Hermesh, Tamar",Current opinion in immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coi.2011.06.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21752617/,311
93667,Prospective Study on Plasma MicroRNA-4286 and Incident Acute Coronary Syndrome.,2021-03-10,"BACKGROUND Although body temperature is one of four key vital signs routinely monitored and treated in clinical practice, relatively little is known about the symptoms associated with febrile states. The purpose of this study was to assess the validity, reliability and feasibility of the Fever Assessment Tool (FAST) in an acute care research setting. METHODS Qualitative: To assess content validity and finalize the FAST instrument, 12 adults from an inpatient medical-surgical unit at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center participated in cognitive interviews within approximately 12 h of a febrile state (tympanic temperature ≥ 38° Celsius). Quantitative: To test reliability, validity and feasibility, 56 new adult inpatients completed the 21-item FAST. RESULTS The cognitive interviews clarified and validated the content of the final 21-item FAST. Fifty-six patients completed the FAST from two to 133 times during routine vital sign assessment, yielding 1,699 temperature time points. Thirty-four percent of the patients (N = 19) experienced fever at one or more time points, with a total of 125 febrile time points. Kuder-Richardson 20 (KR-20) reliability of the FAST was 0.70. Four nonspecific symptom categories, Tired or Run-Down (12), Sleepy (13), Weak or Lacking Energy (11), and Thirsty (9) were among the most frequently reported symptoms in all participants. Using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE), the odds of reporting eight symptoms, Warm (4), Sweating (5), Thirsty (9), General Body Aches (10), Weak or Lacking Energy (11), Tired or Run Down (12) and Difficulty Breathing (17), were increased when patients had a fever (Fever Now), compared to the two other subgroups-patients who had a fever, but not at that particular time point, (Fever Not Now) and patients who never had a fever (Fever Never). Many, but not all, of the comparisons were significant in both groups. CONCLUSION Results suggest the FAST is reliable, valid and easy to administer. In addition to symptoms usually associated with fever (e.g. feeling warm), symptoms such as Difficulty Breathing (17) were identified with fever. Further study in a larger, more diverse patient population is warranted.

It has become not only the way to prepare surgeons for their everyday work, but also a way to certify their skills thus increasing patient safety. This article reviews advances in the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence applied to virtual reality based surgical training over the last 5 years. RECENT FINDINGS Eight articles have been published which met the inclusion criteria. This included six articles about the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence for assessment purposes and two articles about the possibility of teaching applications, including one review and one original research article. All the research articles pointed out the importance of machine learning and artificial intelligence for the stratification of trainees, based on their performance on basic tasks or procedures simulated in a virtual reality environment. SUMMARY Machine learning and artificial intelligence are designed to analyse data and use them to take decisions that typically require human intelligence. Evidence in literature is still scarce about this technology applied to virtual reality and existing manuscripts are mainly focused on its potential to stratify surgical performance and provide synthetic feedbacks about it. In consideration of the exponential growth of computer calculation capabilities, it is possible to expect a parallel increase of research about this topic within the next few years.","Veneziano, Domenico; Cacciamani, Giovanni; Rivas, Juan Gomez; Marino, Nicola; Somani, Bhaskar K",Current opinion in urology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0000000000000824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33009150/,311

This review article aims to give, by highlighting representative methods reported in the last 5 years, an updated and general overview of the main improvements that the use of such well-ordered nanomaterials as electrode modifiers or advanced labels confer to electrochemical affinity biosensors in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, stability, conductivity and biocompatibility focused on food and environmental applications, less covered in the literature than clinics. A wide variety of bioreceptors (antibodies, DNAs, aptamers, lectins, mast cells, DNAzymes), affinity reactions (single, sandwich, competitive and displacement) and detection strategies (label-free or label-based using mainly natural but also artificial enzymes), whose performance is substantially improved when used in conjunction with nanostructured systems, are critically discussed together with the great diversity of molecular targets that nanostructured affinity biosensors are able to quantify using quite simple protocols in a wide variety of matrices and with the sensitivity required by legislation. The large number of possibilities and the versatility of these approaches, the main challenges to face in order to achieve other pursued capabilities (development of antifouling, continuous operation, wash-, calibration- and reagents-free devices, regulatory or Association of Official Analytical Chemists, AOAC, approval) and decisive future actions to achieve the commercialization and acceptance of these devices in our daily routine are also noted at the end.","Campuzano, Susana; Yáñez-Sedeño, Paloma; Pingarrón, José M",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20185125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911860/,311

Recent technical advances enable the recording of increasingly larger neuronal populations to produce increasingly more sophisticated datasets. Despite bold and important open-science and data-sharing policies, these datasets tend to include unique data acquisition methods, behaviors, and file structures. Discrepancies between experimental protocols present key challenges in comparing data between laboratories and across different brain regions and species. Here, we discuss our recent efforts to create a standardized and high-throughput research platform to address these issues. The McGill-Mouse-Miniscope (M3) platform is an initiative to combine miniscope calcium imaging with standardized touchscreen-based animal behavioral testing. The goal is to curate an open-source and standardized framework for acquiring, analyzing, and accessing high-quality data of the neuronal dynamics that underly cognition throughout the brain in mice, marmosets, and models of disease.

Microscopy based detection of mitotic nuclei is a significant overhead and necessitates automation. This work proposes deep CNN based multi-phase mitosis detection framework ""MP-MitDet"" for mitotic nuclei identification in breast cancer histopathological images. The workflow constitutes: (1) label-refiner, (2) tissue-level mitotic region selection, (3) blob analysis, and (4) cell-level refinement. We developed an automatic label-refiner to represent weak labels with semi-sematic information for training of deep CNNs. A deep instance-based detection and segmentation model is used to explore probable mitotic regions on tissue patches. More probable regions are screened based on blob area and then analysed at cell-level by developing a custom CNN classifier ""MitosRes-CNN"" to filter false mitoses. The performance of the proposed ""MitosRes-CNN"" is compared with the state-of-the-art CNNs that are adapted to cell-level discrimination through cross-domain transfer learning and by adding task-specific layers. The performance of the proposed framework shows good discrimination ability in terms of F-score (0.75), recall (0.76), precision (0.71) and area under the precision-recall curve (0.78) on challenging TUPAC16 dataset. Promising results suggest good generalization of the proposed framework that can learn characteristic features from heterogenous mitotic nuclei.","Sohail, Anabia; Khan, Asifullah; Wahab, Noorul; Zameer, Aneela; Khan, Saranjam",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85652-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737632/,311

96933,"Effects of ultrasound-guided stellate-ganglion block on sleep and regional cerebral oxygen saturation in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery: a randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial.",2018,"BACKGROUND We report on the applicability of intraoperative regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) desaturation score by near-infrared spectroscopy in the early detection of postoperative low output state (LOS) in infants with congenital heart disease who underwent cardiac surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between July and October 2011 the intra- and immediate postoperative courses of 22 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease were analyzed. The intraoperative cerebral and somatic rSO2 were measured and a rSO2 desaturation score calculated (by multiplying the rSO2 below 50% of the threshold by seconds). The aim of the study was to evaluate the applicability of intraoperative rSO2 de-saturation score in the early detection of postoperative LOS. RESULTS Thirteen of 22 patients (62%) had an intraoperative cerebral rSO2 desaturation score >3000% per second. Patients with a rSO2 de-saturation score >3000% per second had a significantly lower intraoperative central venous saturation (SvO2, p = 0.002), cardiac index (CI, p = 0.004), oxygen availability indexed (DO2I, p = 0.0004), and a significantly higher extraction of oxygen (ERO2, p = 0.0005) when compared to patients with a rSO2 desaturation score <3000% per second. Nine patients had postoperative LOS; all of them had an intraoperative rSO2 de-saturation score >3000% per second (9/13 patients, 69%; p = 0.001) requiring prompt treatment with major inotropic support, surface hypothermia, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support (n = 4). Twenty-one patients survived. One patient died from ventricular failure and inability to wean from ECMO support. CONCLUSION The intraoperative use of NIRS provided an early warning sign of hemodynamic or metabolic compromise, enabling early and rapid intervention to prevent or reduce the severity of potentially life-threatening complications.","Zulueta, Jose L; Vida, Vladimiro L; Perisinotto, Egle; Pittarello, Demetrio; Stellin, Giovanni",Journal of cardiac surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.12122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23734582/,311

METHODS A total of 45 patients with thoracic esophageal cancer who underwent reconstruction with cervical esophagogastric anastomosis by iTST using a linear stapler after MIE between January 2016 and January 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. We modified and improved upon the TST by adding a 1- to 2-cm vertical incision on the anterior wall of the remnant esophageal stump to enlarge the anastomotic lumen and thereby reduce the risk of anastomotic stenosis. The short-term patient outcomes were determined to assess the safety and feasibility of our procedures. RESULTS The median operating time was 686 (range, 319-1110) minutes, and the median blood loss was 170 (range, 5-1180) ml. There were no cases of anastomotic stenosis in this study, although 2 patients (4.4%) developed minor anastomotic leakage. A case (2.2%) of tracheal fistula due to the apex of the triangular anastomosis was resolved simply by delaying the patient's oral intake. The mean length of the hospitalization was 21 days. CONCLUSIONS The iTST provides a larger lumen unlimited by the size of the esophagus in cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. This technique is feasible, and sufficient short-term results have been achieved. Further studies with the accumulation of more cases will be required to prove the benefits of iTST for reconstruction after MIE.","Shibao, Kazunori; Inoue, Yuzuru; Sawatsubashi, Yusuke; Kohi, Siro; Matayoshi, Nobutaka; Tanoue, Takayuki; Sato, Nagahiro; Katsuki, Takefumi; Hirata, Keiji",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-021-05997-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33611662/,311

The squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) has been identified as a precursor lesion to SCC, stratifying the abnormality into low grade (LSIL) or high grade (HSIL). There have been studies on the prevalence of incidentally found SCC in haemorrhoidectomy specimens, there are no studies to date on the incidence of dysplasia. The purpose of this study was to establish a baseline incidence of dysplasia that provides helpful information for future epidemiological studies. METHODS A retrospective review of patients who underwent haemorrhoidectomy from 2005-2019. Pathology regarding what type of dysplasia, medications, and diagnoses that may predispose to immunosuppression were collected. RESULTS 810 patients of a mean age of 51.7 (range 20-91) years underwent haemorrhoidectomy. 18 (2.2%) of the patients had abnormal pathology [low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) =3, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) =12, SCC=2, adenocarcinoma=1]. 37 (4.5%) of the entire cohort had some risk factors for immunosuppression: chronic steroid use (9), HIV (13), biologic medications (6), transplant recipients (2) and immunocompromising diseases (4).

These important meetings were integral to patient care, facilitated care coordination, and improved the managed care of the patient. During COVID-19 and beyond, these important relationships should be fostered via digital means. We aimed to identify opportunities of digital health integration for the optimization of physician integration. STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional study. METHODS Prior to COVID-19, we conducted a survey of PCPs at a large multidisciplinary group with more than 1500 physicians that staffs multiple hospitals within a health system. The survey was sent via email with only 1 reminder. RESULTS Thirty-six PCPs responded to the survey; 25% (9/36) were very satisfied and 19.4% (7/36) were moderately satisfied with the current in-person introductions. The PCPs found introductions to specialists helpful; 83.7% (31/37) wanted to ""put a name to the face,"" and 64.9% (24/37) wanted to ""understand the range of service provided by the specialist."" Fifty-one percent (19/37) and 54% (20/37) said ""I can better manage patient care and know when to refer to a specialist"" and ""I learn more about a particular specialist,"" respectively, with specialist introductions.

While safe and effective vaccines have been developed, research is expected to continue for many years regarding the optimal implementation of existing vaccines in specific settings, and the development of second-generation vaccines that may offer advantages in terms of either efficacy or ease of implementation. Given this context, some commentators have argued that new Covid vaccine trials should be able to use placebo controls, and that existing studies should be able to continue with blinded participants in order to collect high quality, unbiased data. Using international ethics guidance documents, this paper argues against placebo controls, given the existence of proven effective interventions, and against protracted blinding once safety and efficacy milestones have been met. Instead, it advocates for study designs that allow for direct comparison between approved and experimental vaccines, which facilitates both data collection and greater access to vaccines.","Haire, Bridget",Indian journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.20529/ijme.2021.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33908354/,311
103171,Early identification of patients with severe COVID-19 at increased risk of in-hospital death: a multicenter case-control study in Wuhan.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND Radiofrequency (RF) hyperthermia is commonly used as an adjunct to established treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy for the management of cancer patients. This case report aims to introduce the use of hyperthermia, in combination with chemotherapy, for the treatment of unresectable gastric cancer in a patient implanted with a vagus nerve stimulator (VNS). CASE REPORT A 55-year-old man with dermatomyositis, laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma in situ and double synchronous gastric cancer was found to have unresectable gastric disease during surgery despite neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Postoperatively, he received chemotherapy with RF hyperthermia. The patient had a VNS implant to treat epileptic seizures. VNS failure due to RF hyperthermia was an area of significant concern, and the procedures were completed with a full preparation to manage epileptic seizures in the event of its anticipated occurrence. Twenty-one thermotherapies were performed over 21 weeks. After 3 courses of S-1 chemotherapy (12 weeks) with RF hyperthermia without any adverse events, the regimen was changed to S-1+ CDDP combination chemotherapy (SP) and RF hyperthermia. The patient continued to receive treatment with a decrease in the size of the primary gastric tumors as well as lymph node metastases, without major adverse events, until he died due to disseminated disease. CONCLUSIONS We report the first case of unresectable gastric cancer with VNS implants in which chemo-hyperthermal therapy was safe and successful. This case report highlights the importance of providing a multidisciplinary treatment with appropriate measures for patients with intractable cancer who have received special treatments for underlying comorbidities.","Sawai, Hirozumi; Ueno, Shuhei; Yamaguchi, Yoshimi; Suzuki, Yuka; Murata, Akemi; Suganuma, Enami; Yamamoto, Kazuya; Kuzuya, Hiromasa; Koide, Shuji; Kurimoto, Masaaki; Yanagi, Takeshi; Koide, Hajime; Kamiya, Atsushi",The American journal of case reports,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.931564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400601/,311

Its purpose is to accelerate clinical testing of promising therapeutics in spinal cord injury (SCI) through the development of a robust interactive infrastructure. This structure includes key committees that serve to provide longitudinal guidance to the Network. These committees include the Executive, Data Management, and Neurological Outcome Assessments Committees, and the Therapeutic Selection Committee (TSC), which is the subject of this manuscript. The NACTN brings unique elements to the SCI field. The Network's stability is not restricted to a single clinical trial. Network members have diverse expertise and include experts in clinical care, clinical trial design and methodology, pharmacology, preclinical and clinical research, and advanced rehabilitation techniques. Frequent systematic communication is assigned a high value, as is democratic process, fairness and efficiency of decision making, and resource allocation. This article focuses on how decision making occurs within the TSC to rank alternative therapeutics according to 2 main variables: quality of the preclinical data set, and fit with the Network's aims and capabilities. This selection process is important because if the Network's resources are committed to a therapeutic, alternatives cannot be pursued. A proposed methodology includes a multicriteria decision analysis that uses a Multi-Attribute Global Inference of Quality matrix to quantify the process. To rank therapeutics, the TSC uses a series of consensus steps designed to reduce individual and group bias and limit subjectivity. Given the difficulties encountered by industry in completing clinical trials in SCI, stable collaborative not-for-profit consortia, such as the NACTN, may be essential to clinical progress in SCI. The evolution of the NACTN also offers substantial opportunity to refine decision making and group dynamics. Making the best possible decisions concerning therapeutics selection for trial testing is a cornerstone of the Network's function.","Guest, James; Harrop, James S; Aarabi, Bizhan; Grossman, Robert G; Fawcett, James W; Fehlings, Michael G; Tator, Charles H",Journal of neurosurgery.

104163,Duration of the action of rocuronium in patients with BMI of less than 25: An observational study.,2018,"PURPOSE Mast cells, historically known for their effector function in the induction of allergic diseases, reside in all vascularized tissues of the body in particular proximity to blood and lymphatic vessels. As neighboring sentinel cells to blood vessels, mast cells have been associated with angiogenesis. Here we assess the direct contribution of mast cells to neovascularization at the ocular surface. METHODS Corneal neovascularization was induced by placing a single figure-of-eight intrastromal suture 1 mm from the limbus in mast cell-deficient (cKitW-sh), C57BL/6, and Balb/c mice. Corneas were harvested at 6 h post-suture to quantify cKit+FcεR1+ mast cells using flow cytometry and tear wash was collected within 6 h to measure β-hexosaminidase and tryptase. Neovascularization was assessed using slit-lamp biomicroscope and immunohistochemistry analysis of corneas harvested on day 4 post-suture. To investigate the effects of mast cells on blood vessel growth, mast cells were co-cultured with vascular endothelial cells (VECs), and tube formation and proliferation of VECs were measured. 2% cromolyn was administered locally to inhibit mast cell activation in vivo. RESULTS Placement of corneal suture activates ocular surface mast cells which infiltrate into the cornea adjacent to new vessels. Mast cell-deficient mice develop significantly fewer new vessels following suture placement. Mast cells directly promote VEC proliferation and tube formation, partly through secreting high levels of VEGF-A. Pharmacological inhibition of mast cell activation results in significantly less corneal neovascularization. CONCLUSION Our data demonstrate that ocular surface mast cells are critical to corneal neovascularization, suggesting mast cells as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of corneal neovascularization.","Cho, WonKyung; Mittal, Sharad K; Elbasiony, Elsayed; Chauhan, Sunil K",The ocular surface,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtos.2020.09.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916251/,311

However, the insufficiency in skin commonality and biocompatibility brings up challenges in making such devices. In this study, an ultra-flexible and biocompatible CoFeB/silk film is developed potentially for on-skin and implantable RF/microwave applications. Moreover, the CoFeB/silk films present controllable dissolvability in aqueous solutions and exhibit great potentials in applications for environmentally friendly disposable devices. A strain-tunable bandstop filter based on the CoFeB/silk film was fabricated, which exhibited a large frequency tunability of 3 GHz and ability in monitoring the finger-joints' motions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty voluntary renal donors who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized to standard laparoscopic (group A) and LESS (group B) donor nephrectomies. The primary end point of the study was patients' postoperative pain. The clinical outcomes, patient's quality of life, body image, and cosmetic scores on follow-up were also compared. RESULTS The operating times were similar in both groups (175.83 ± 47.57 vs. 172.20 ± 38.33 minutes, p = 0.38). The surgeon's difficulty as measured using a visual analog scale was significantly more in group B in 4 of 10 defined steps. The postoperative patient pain scores were similar till 48 hours following surgery (3.84 ± 1.68 vs. 3.68 ± 0.75, p = 0.33), but following which the patients in group B had improved pain scores (2.08 ± 0.91 vs. 1.24 ± 0.72, p = 0.0004). Analgesic requirements were similar in both groups (p = 0.47). The warm ischemia times in group B (5.11 ± 1.01 vs. 7.15 ± 1.84 minutes, p < 0.0001) were longer but the total ischemia times in both groups were similar (62.55 ± 9.46 vs. 62.71 ± 12.14 minutes, p = 0.48). All grafts had on-table urine output in the recipient. Intraoperative (8% vs. 16%, p = 0.2) and postoperative complications (20% vs. 16%, p = 0.99) in both groups were comparable. The patients in group B had shorter hospital stay (4.56 ± 0.82 vs. 3.92 ± 0.76 days, p = 0.003). There was no graft loss in either group except for one recipient in group A who sustained sudden cardiac death. The estimated glomerular filtration rates of recipients at 1 year were comparable for both groups (80.87 ± 22.12 vs. 81.51 ± 29.01 mL/minute, p = 0.46). The donor's quality of life, body image, and cosmetic scores were comparable for both groups. CONCLUSION In this select group of donors, LESS donor nephrectomy, although challenging to the surgeon with longer warm ischemic times, gave early pain relief with shorter hospital stay and comparable graft function.","Kurien, Abraham; Rajapurkar, Sujata; Sinha, Lokesh; Mishra, Shashikant; Ganpule, Arvind; Muthu, Veeramani; Sabnis, Ravindra; Desai, Mahesh",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2010.0250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21198375/,311

Risk factors and clinical outcomes.,2020-09-14,"Early prediction of the final size of any epidemic and in particular for Zika disease outbreaks can be useful for health authorities in order to plan the response to the outbreak. The Richards model is often been used to estimate epidemiological parameters for arboviral diseases based on the reported cumulative cases in single- and multi-wave outbreaks. However, other non-linear models can also fit the data as well. Typically, one follows the so called post selection estimation procedure, i.e., selects the best fitting model out of the set of candidate models and ignores the model uncertainty in both estimation and inference since these procedures are based on a single model. In this paper we focus on the estimation of the final size and the turning point of the epidemic and conduct a real-time prediction for the final size of the outbreak using several non-linear models in which these parameters are estimated via model averaging. The proposed method is applied to Zika outbreak data in four cities from Colombia, during the outbreak ocurred in 2015-2016.","Sebrango-Rodríguez, C R; Martínez-Bello, D A; Sánchez-Valdés, L; Thilakarathne, P J; Del Fava, E; VAN DER Stuyft, P; López-Quílez, A; Shkedy, Z",Epidemiology and infection,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268817001078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28566102/,311

We focused on ISTs occurring in major cerebral arteries and analyzed their rate of instant reocclusion during mechanical thrombectomy (MT) compared with non-ISTs. Also, we introduced a treatment strategy of low-dose intra-arterial tirofiban administration to prevent such reocclusion following repeat recanalization, and evaluated its safety and efficacy. METHODS We analyzed 168 consecutive patients treated with MT over a 2-year period from May 2011 to April 2013. During MT, if angiography following a successful recanalization showed stenosis at the occlusion site, we performed additional angiographic runs every 10 min for 30 min after the recanalization. Then, if angiography revealed reocclusion, we performed a repeat recanalization, using the same MT technique but additionally followed by low-dose intra-arterial tirofiban infusion. Time-of-flight MR angiography or CT angiography was performed to confirm any underlying ICAS at the occlusion site 5-7 days after the procedure. The patients who had confirmed underlying ICAS were included in the IST cohort. RESULTS Of 168 enrolled patients, we excluded 36 who could not be checked for underlying ICAS at the occlusion site for one of the following reasons: recanalization failure (n = 11), rescue stenting after tirofiban failure (n = 5) and lack of follow-up vascular imaging (n = 20). The incidence of IST was 30.3% (40/132). All IST patients were confirmed to have underlying ICAS by follow-up vascular imaging. Instant reocclusion after successful recanalization was significantly more frequent in the IST cohort [26/40 (65%) vs. 3/92 (3.3%); p < 0.001]. Regarding the efficacy of low-dose intra-arterial tirofiban infusion, 85.7% of the reocclusion patients finally achieved a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score 2/3 recanalization, but in the remaining 14.3% of the cases, the condition was refractory to the procedure and required rescue stenting. There were no cases of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage following the procedure. CONCLUSIONS In situ thromboocclusion was characterized by a significantly higher chance of instant reocclusion during MT. In such cases, low-dose intra-arterial tirofiban administration may be effective and safe. However, future confirmation by prospective multicenter trials seems necessary.","Kang, Dong-Hun; Kim, Yong-Won; Hwang, Yang-Ha; Park, Sung-Pa; Kim, Yong-Sun; Baik, Seung Kug",Cerebrovascular diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000362435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24941966/,311

Here, Er3+ single atom composite photocatalysts are successfully constructed based on both the special role of Er3+ and the special advantages of Zn2 GeO4 /g-C3 N4 heterojunction in the photocatalysis reduction of CO2 . Especially, Zn2 GeO4 :Er3+ /g-C3 N4 obtained by in situ synthesis is not only more conducive to the tight junction of Zn2 GeO4 and g-C3 N4 , but also more favorable for g-C3 N4 to anchor rare-earth atoms. Under visible-light irradiation, Zn2 GeO4 :Er3+ /g-C3 N4 shows more than five times enhancement in the catalytic efficiency compared to that of pure g-C3 N4 without any sacrificial agent in the photocatalytic reaction system. A series of theoretical and experimental results show that the charge density around Er, Ge, Zn, and O increases compared with Zn2 GeO4 :Er3+ , while the charge density around C decreases compared with g-C3 N4 . These results show that an efficient way of electron transfer is provided to promote charge separation, and the dual functions of CO2 molecular activation of Er3+ single atom and 4f levels as electron transport bridge are fully exploited. The pattern of combining single-atom catalysis and heterojunction opens up new methods for enhancing photocatalytic activity.","Han, Zhendong; Zhao, Yue; Gao, Guoyang; Zhang, Wanying; Qu, Yang; Zhu, Hongyang; Zhu, Peifen; Wang, Guofeng",Small,https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202102089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047048/,311

The epidemiological evidence, diagnostic criteria and pathogenesis of post-COVID-19 syndrome are reviewed. DEVELOPMENT Post-COVID-19 syndrome is defined by persistent clinical signs and symptoms that appear while or after suffering COVID-19, persist for more than 12 weeks and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. The symptoms can fluctuate or cause relapses. It is a heterogeneous condition that includes post-viral chronic fatigue syndrome, sequelae in multiple organs and the effects of severe hospitalisation/post-intensive care syndrome. It has been reported in patients with mild or severe COVID-19 and irrespective of the severity of the symptoms in the acute phase. Between 10% and 65% of survivors who had mild/moderate COVID-19 present symptoms of post-COVID-19 syndrome for 12 weeks or more. At six months, subjects report an average of 14 persistent symptoms. The most common symptoms are fatigue, dyspnoea, anxiety, depression, and impaired attention, concentration, memory and sleep. The underlying biological mechanisms are unknown, although an abnormal or excessive autoimmune and inflammatory response may play an important role. CONCLUSIONS Clinical manifestations are diverse, fluctuating and variable, although fatigue and neurocognitive complaints predominate.

Data was collected from 2008 to 2018 from adolescent advisors (n = 60) and researchers (n = 25), and included feedback sessions, social media, anonymous ""post-boxes"" and interviews. Findings include the value of adolescent involvement in multiple stages of research co-creation and engagement in policy processes, the need for a safe environment and supporting adolescents living in extreme vulnerability. We also discuss the reconfiguring of power and personal relationships, and logistical and financial needs of adolescent advisory groups. Findings suggest that adolescent co-creation of research is feasible, even with very vulnerable adolescents, although ethical considerations need to be carefully addressed. Benefits include increased methodological rigour, enhanced adolescent acceptability of research and the recalibration of research dynamics for the empowerment of their target beneficiaries.

The esterase D (ESD) gene maps at a similar location as the RB gene locus and therefore serves as a potential marker for the prognosis of retinoblastoma. Because very little is known about the structure and function of ESD, we determined the 3-dimensional structure of the enzyme at 1.5 A resolution using X-ray crystallography. ESD shows a single domain with an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold. A number of insertions are observed in the canonical alpha/beta-hydrolase fold. The active site is located in a positively charged, shallow cleft on the surface lined by a number of aromatic residues. Superimposition studies helped identify the typical catalytic triad residues--Ser-153, His264, and Asp230--involved in catalysis. Mutagenesis of any of the catalytic triad residues to alanine abolished the enzyme activity. Backbone amides of Leu54 and Met150 are involved in the formation of the oxyanion hole. Interestingly, a M150A mutation increased the enzyme activity by 62%. The structure of human ESD determined in this study will aid the elucidation of the physiological role of the enzyme in the human body and will assist in the early diagnosis of retinoblastoma.","Wu, Dong; Li, Yang; Song, Gaojie; Zhang, David; Shaw, Neil; Liu, Zhi-Jie",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.08-125286; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19126594/,311

Over the years, various investigations have purified and characterized mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) from different human tissues as cells with multilineage differentiation potential under the appropriate conditions. Due to their appealing characteristics and versatile potentials, MSCs are leveraged in many applications in medicine such as oncology, bioprinting, and as recent as therapeutics discovery and innovation for COVID-19. To date, studies indicate that MSCs have varied differentiation capabilities into different cell types, and demonstrate immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory properties. Different microenvironments or niche for MSCs and their resulting heterogeneity may influence attendant cellular behavior and differentiation capacity. The potential clinical applications of MSCs and exosomes derived from these cells have led to an avalanche of research reports on their properties and hundreds of clinical trials being undertaken. There is ample reason to think, as discussed in this expert review that the future looks bright and promising for MSC research, with many clinical trials under way to ascertain their clinical utility. This review provides a synthesis of the latest advances and trends in MSC research to allow for broad and critically informed use of MSCs.

Most countries are expected to fail to protect >90% of their available climate at current levels. The evenness of climatic representation under protection-not the amount of area protected-positively influenced the retention of climatic conditions under protection. On average, protection retention would increase by ~118% if countries doubled their climatic representativeness under protection or by ~102% if countries collectively reduced emissions in accordance with global targets.

Coronavirus 2 is a member of a virus family with lipid envelope that fuses with host cell through endocytosis, internalizing its components in the cell. In vitro cell models have shown that depletion of cholesterol by cyclodextrin, and particularly methyl beta cyclodextrin disturb the host cell membrane lipid composition this way reducing the attachment of the virus to the protein receptors. This review aims to summarize the state of the art of research concerning the use of cyclodextrin or its complexes as a potential treatment against this new virus and update work already published.","Sofiane, Fatmi; Lamia, Taouzinet; Mohamed, Skiba; Mokrane, Iguer-Ouada",Current drug delivery,https://doi.org/10.2174/1567201817666200917124241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32940180/,311

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Professional societies provided ad-hoc guidance at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic on deferral of surgical and perioperative interventions, but these lack specific parameters to determine the optimal timing of surgery. METHODS Using the GRADE system, published evidence was analyzed to generate weighted statements for stage, site, acuity of presentation and hospital setting to specify when surgery should be pursued, the time and duration of oncologically acceptable delays, and when to utilize non-surgical modalities to bridge the waiting period. RESULTS Colorectal cancer surgeries - prioritized as emergency, urgent with (a) imminent emergency or (b) oncologically urgent, or elective - were matched against the phases of the pandemic. Surgery in COVID-19 positive patients must be avoided. Emergent and imminent emergent cases should mostly proceed unless resources are exhausted. Standard practices allow for postponement of elective cases and deferral to nonsurgical modalities of stage II/III rectal and metastatic colorectal cancer. Oncologically urgent cases may be delayed for 6(-12) weeks without jeopardizing oncological outcomes. Outside established principles, administration of nonsurgical modalities is not justified and increases the vulnerability of patients. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed already limited health care resources and forced rationing, triage and prioritization of care in general, specifically of surgical interventions. Established guidelines allow for modifications of optimal timing and type of surgery for colorectal cancer during an unrelated pandemic.","O'Leary, Michael P; Choong, Kevin C; Thornblade, Lucas W; Fakih, Marwan G; Fong, Yuman; Kaiser, Andreas M",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32452949/,311

The aim of our study was to retrospectively delineate the feasibility of the combined use of emergent carotid stenting and intra-arterial (IA) Abciximab with intracranial revascularization in the setting of acute ischemic stroke and carotid occlusions at our institution. METHODS Eleven patients with complete cervical carotid occlusion with or without concomitant intracranial ICA and/or MCA occlusion were identified from a single center, retrospective review of patients admitted to the Stroke unit. We evaluated all cases for complications of emergent cervical ICA recanalization employing carotid stenting and IA Abciximab. RESULTS All patients had complete cervical carotid occlusion with (n = 8) or without (n = 3) concomitant intracranial ICA and/or MCA occlusion. Successful emergent cervical ICA recanalization was achieved in all cases. All patients were administered IA Abciximab (dose range 6-17 mg, average 11.4 mg) immediately following the cervical carotid stenting. There was complete recanalization in all patients with no procedural morbidity or mortality. A single case (1/11, 9%) developed asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. Upon discharge, 9 patients (9/11, 82%) had a mRS of 0-2 and 2 patients (2/11, 18%) had a mRS of 3. CONCLUSIONS In acute ICA-MCA/distal ICA occlusions, extracranial stenting followed by intracranial IA Abciximab and thrombectomy appears feasible, effective, and safe. Further evaluation of this treatment strategy is warranted.","Al-Mufti, Fawaz; Amuluru, Krishna; Manning, Nathan W; Khan, Imad; Peeling, Lissa; Gandhi, Chirag D; Prestigiacomo, Charles J; Pushchinska, Galyna; Fiorella, David; Woo, Henry H",British journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1080/02688697.2017.1297377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28298139/,311

AIM To identify strategies for the successful implementation and sustainable use of PSI-based interventions in routine primary care. DESIGN & SETTING Qualitative study in primary care settings across England. METHOD Anchoring on a complex pharmacist-led IT-based intervention (PINCER) and clinical decision support (CDS) for prescribing and medicines management, we conducted a qualitative study using sequential, multiple methods which comprised of documentary analysis, semi-structured interviews and online workshops to identify challenges and possible solutions to the longer-term sustainability of PINCER and CDS. Thematic analysis was used for the documentary analysis and stakeholder workshops, whilst template analysis was used for the semi-structured interviews. Findings across the three methods were synthesised using the RE-AIM framework. RESULTS We analysed 48 documents, undertook 27 interviews and two workshops involving 20 participants. Five main issues were identified, which aligned with the adoption and maintenance dimensions of RE-AIM: fitting into current context (adoption); engaging hearts and minds (maintenance); building resilience (maintenance); achieving engagement with secondary care (maintenance); and emphasising complementarity (maintenance). CONCLUSIONS Extending ownership of prescribing safety beyond primary care-based pharmacists and achieving greater alignment between general practice and hospital prescribing safety initiatives is fundamental to achieve sustained impact of PSI-based interventions in primary care.","Shamsuddin, Azwa; Jeffries, Mark; Sheikh, Aziz; Laing, Libby; Salema, Nde-Eshimuni; Avery, Anthony J; Chuter, Antony; Waring, Justin; Keers, Richard N",BJGP open,https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgpo.2021.0109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34226173/,311

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of D. gallinae on the development of post-vaccination immune responses in layer hens. (2) Methods: A total of 80 blood samples were collected at four time-points (B1-B4) from 10 Hy-Line Brown hens, randomly selected from a commercial layer farm. The flock was naturally infested with D. gallinae and treated twice with Biobeck PA 910 (AI silicon dioxide). The samples were collected before and after each treatment. The percentages of IgM+ B cells, CD3+/CD4+ T cells and CD3+/CD8a+ T cells were determined by flow cytometry; the titres of antibodies against avian encephalomyelitis, infectious bronchitis virus, Newcastle disease virus, Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale, reticuloendotheliosis virus and avian reovirus were determined by the immunoenzymatic method. (3) Results: The percentage of Th cells and post-vaccination anti-IBV and anti-NDV antibodies decreased significantly at the second infestation peak when the number of parasites was twice higher than at the first infestation peak. Non-significant negative correlations were found between the number of mites and the percentage of B cells (R = -0.845, p > 0.05) and between the number of mites and the percentage of Th cells (R = -0.522, p > 0.05), and a significant positive correlation was noted between the number of mites and the percentage of Tc cells (R = -0.982, p < 0.05). There were non-significant correlations between the number of mites and antibody titres. (4) Conclusion: The present findings suggested that D. gallinae might inhibit immune responses since the percentages of B cells and Th cells were negatively correlated with the number of mites. The percentage of Tc cells was positively correlated with the number of mites, which indicated that D. gallinae could stimulate cellular immune responses in infested laying hens. However, further research is needed to determine whether D. gallinae suppresses the production of vaccine-induced antibodies.","Koziatek-Sadłowska, Sylwia; Sokół, Rajmund",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10060987; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32517104/,311

We have already reported gastric tube (GT) reconstruction after PG and performed it on more than 100 patients. No studies have reported long-term outcomes after PG-GT. The aim of this study was to investigate long-term outcomes, including nutrition indices, such as body weight, serum albumin, total protein, hemoglobin, and ferritin after PG, and observe recovery of upper gastrointestinal tract motility. METHODS We analyzed body weight loss and laboratory findings at our outpatient clinic at 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months postoperatively. Manometric recording was carried out at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after surgery. RESULTS The percentage change in body weight in the PG-GT group was significantly larger than that in the PG-JI and TG-RY groups at 2.5, 3, 4, and 5 years after surgery. The levels of hemoglobin and ferritin in the PG-GT and PG-JI groups were significantly higher than those in the TG-RY group at all time points except 6 months after surgery. In the fasted state, the phase III originated at the gastric tube was propagated to the duodenum 3 years after surgery. In the fed state, phasic contractions of the duodenum were in harmony with gastric tube contractions 3 years after surgery. CONCLUSIONS PG-GT is the least invasive procedure, and restoration of gastrointestinal motilities in the gastric tube and duodenum may ameliorate body weight loss and nutritional status, including anemia, in patients after PG.","Toyomasu, Yoshitaka; Ogata, Kyoichi; Suzuki, Masaki; Yanoma, Toru; Kimura, Akiharu; Kogure, Norimichi; Yanai, Mitsuhiro; Ohno, Tetsuro; Mochiki, Erito; Kuwano, Hiroyuki",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-5127-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27444825/,311

Topical NSAIDs are thought to afford efficacy that is comparable to oral formulations while reducing widespread systemic drug exposure, which may provide a benefit in terms of safety and tolerability. As a result, European treatment guidelines have, for many years, recommended the use of topical NSAIDs as a safe and effective treatment option for OA. Following the recent approval of several topical NSAID formulations by the US Food and Drug Administration, US treatment guidelines are increasingly recommending the use of topical NSAIDs as an alternative therapy and, in some cases, as a first-line option for OA. This commentary summarizes OA treatment guidelines that are currently available and discusses their potential evolution with regard to the increased inclusion of topical NSAIDs.","Balmaceda, Casilda M",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2474-15-27; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24444047/,311

The aim of the study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing tourniquet versus non-tourniquet use during fracture surgery of the lower limb in adult patients. METHOD A search was performed using the keyword ""tourniquet"" in EmBase and as a MeSH term in PubMed, and no limitations (including language) were applied. Available studies were screened using the Covidence software, and demographic as well as outcome data were extracted from the final studies. Critical appraisal was performed according to Cochrane Risk of Bias guidelines. Pooled data were assessed for heterogeneity using Chi-squared and I2 tests. RESULTS Five studies were included, and no statistically significant difference was found in the amount of pain and post-operative complications between tourniquet and non-tourniquet groups. Length of in-hospital stay was longer in the tourniquet groups. An overall high risk of bias was found in the included studies. CONCLUSION Although the validity and statistical strength of our results are not strong enough to suggest a change in practice in tourniquet use, the operating surgeon should still carefully consider his or her decision to use a tourniquet in lower limb fracture surgery, as there are indeed complications associated with it and no current evidence to support its continued use.

123424,Efficacy and Safety of Nonoperative Treatment for Acute Appendicitis: A Meta-analysis.,2017,"The four human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are globally endemic respiratory pathogens. The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (CoV) is an emerging CoV with a known zoonotic source in dromedary camels. Little is known about the origins of endemic HCoVs. Studying these viruses' evolutionary history could provide important insight into CoV emergence. In tests of MERS-CoV-infected dromedaries, we found viruses related to an HCoV, known as HCoV-229E, in 5.6% of 1,033 animals. Human- and dromedary-derived viruses are each monophyletic, suggesting ecological isolation. One gene of dromedary viruses exists in two versions in camels, full length and deleted, whereas only the deleted version exists in humans. The deletion increased in size over a succession starting from camelid viruses via old human viruses to contemporary human viruses. Live isolates of dromedary 229E viruses were obtained and studied to assess human infection risks. The viruses used the human entry receptor aminopeptidase N and replicated in human hepatoma cells, suggesting a principal ability to cause human infections. However, inefficient replication in several mucosa-derived cell lines and airway epithelial cultures suggested lack of adaptation to the human host. Dromedary viruses were as sensitive to the human type I interferon response as HCoV-229E. Antibodies in human sera neutralized dromedary-derived viruses, suggesting population immunity against dromedary viruses. Although no current epidemic risk seems to emanate from these viruses, evolutionary inference suggests that the endemic human virus HCoV-229E may constitute a descendant of camelid-associated viruses. HCoV-229E evolution provides a scenario for MERS-CoV emergence.","Corman, Victor M; Eckerle, Isabella; Memish, Ziad A; Liljander, Anne M; Dijkman, Ronald; Jonsdottir, Hulda; Juma Ngeiywa, Kisi J Z; Kamau, Esther; Younan, Mario; Al Masri, Malakita; Assiri, Abdullah; Gluecks, Ilona; Musa, Bakri E; Meyer, Benjamin; Müller, Marcel A; Hilali, Mosaad; Bornstein, Set; Wernery, Ulrich; Thiel, Volker; Jores, Joerg; Drexler, Jan Felix; Drosten, Christian",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1604472113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27528677/,311

We surveyed general surgery graduates to assess the relationships among rotation satisfaction, CT disease exposure, rotation length, mentorship, and mistreatment. DESIGN A survey assessing CT curriculum, exposure, mentorship, and satisfaction was forwarded to general surgery graduates from 17 residency programs. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to assess statistical significance of ordinal level data. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. SETTING This study was conducted at the University of Michigan Health System in Ann Arbor, MI, a tertiary care center. PARTICIPANTS The survey was sent to approximately 1300 graduates of general surgery residency programs who graduated between the years of 1999 to 2014. A total of 94 responses were completed and received. RESULTS Receiving adequate exposure to CT procedures and disease management was significantly associated with higher satisfaction ratings for all procedures, particularly thoracotomy incisions (p < 0.001), empyemas and pleural effusions (p < 0.001), and lung cancer care (p < 0.001). The absence of mistreatment and good/very good mentorship were both positively associated with higher reported satisfaction (p = 0.018 and p < 0.001, respectively). Increased length of time on CT rotation was neither associated with improved levels of satisfaction nor with an improvement in the quality of mentorship. CONCLUSION Rotation satisfaction is positively associated with procedure exposure, better mentorship, and the absence of mistreatment. Longer rotation length was not associated with satisfaction. Shorter rotations are not detrimental to training if they have focused clinical exposure and invested mentors to maximize resident satisfaction. These specific markers of rotation quality are useful in curricular design.","Lussiez, Alisha; Bevins, Jack; Plaska, Andrew; Rosin, Vadim; Reddy, Rishindra M",Journal of surgical education,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2015.09.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26531743/,311

Given its ability to provide quantitative data on human samples in a simple, low-cost single-use format, we anticipate that this platform will find broad utility in clinical diagnostics for a broad range of assays.","Cognetti, John S; Steiner, Daniel J; Abedin, Minhaz; Bryan, Michael R; Shanahan, Conor; Tokranova, Natalya; Young, Ethan; Klose, Alanna M; Zavriyev, Alexander; Judy, Nicholas; Piorek, Brian; Meinhart, Carl; Jakubowicz, Raymond; Warren, Harold; Cady, Nathaniel C; Miller, Benjamin L",Lab on a chip,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1lc00369k; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34160511/,311
125846,Exercise rehabilitation in ventricular assist device recipients: a meta-analysis of effects on physiological and clinical outcomes.,2019,"The kidney is a complicated and important internal organ receiving approximately 20% of the cardiac output and mediates numerous pathophysiologic actions. These include selectively filtering macromolecules of the blood, exquisite reclaimation of electrolyctes, urine concentration via an elegant osmotic mechanism, and excretion of an acid load. In addition, the renal tubules carry out secretory functions and produce hormones and cytokines. The kidney receives innervation and hormonal regulation. Therefore, dysfunction of the kidney leads to retention of metabolic waste products, and/or significant proteinuria and hematuria. In the past several decades, the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in intercellular communications, and the uptake of EVs by recipient cells through phagocytosis and endocytosis have been elucidated. The new knowledge on EVs expands over the classical mechanisms of cellular interaction, and may change our way of thinking of renal pathophysiology in the subcellular scale. Based on some ultrastructural discoveries in the kidney, this review will focus on the role of EVs in intercellular communications, their internalization by recipient cells, and their relationship to renal pathology.","Zhang, Ping L; Liu, Ming-Lin",Journal of cellular physiology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.30268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33432614/,311

The authors also studied the influence of stimulation on this interaction. METHODS Forty patients received combined concentrations of remifentanil (0 to 12 ng/ml) and sevoflurane (0.5 to 3.5 vol%) according to a crisscross design (160 concentration pairs). During pseudo-steady-state anesthesia, the pharmacodynamic measures were obtained before and after a series of noxious and nonnoxious stimulations. For the ""prestimulation"" and ""poststimulation"" BIS, SE, RE, Composite Variability Index, and Surgical Pleth Index, interaction models were applied to find the best fit, by using NONMEM 7.2.0. (Icon Development Solutions, Hanover, MD). RESULTS The authors found an additive interaction between sevoflurane and remifentanil on BIS, SE, and RE. For Composite Variability Index, a moderate synergism was found. The comparison of pre- and poststimulation data revealed a shift of C50SEVO for BIS, SE, and RE, with a consistent increase of 0.3 vol%. The Surgical Pleth Index data did not result in plausible parameter estimates, neither before nor after stimulation. CONCLUSIONS By combining pre- and poststimulation data, interaction models for BIS, SE, and RE demonstrate a consistent influence of ""stimulation"" on the pharmacodynamic relationship between sevoflurane and remifentanil. Significant population variability exists for Composite Variability Index and Surgical Pleth Index.","Heyse, Bjorn; Proost, Johannes H; Hannivoort, Laura N; Eleveld, Douglas J; Luginbühl, Martin; Struys, Michel M R F; Vereecke, Hugo E M",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000000180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24566244/,311

129087,Predictors of Mortality in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure: Is Hyponatremia a Useful Clinical Biomarker?,2020,"Background: Post Kala Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a non-fatal dermal sequel of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), affecting individuals worldwide. Available diagnostic tools lack sensitivity and specificity toward identifying macular (MAC) PKDL patients, due to low parasite load in patients' sample. Confirmatory test like punch biopsy are invasive and painful. Considering the rural nature of this disease and the prevailing situation of diagnostic scenario, PKDL patients mostly remains unattended from receiving proper medical care. They in turn act as ""mobile parasite reservoir,"" responsible for VL transmission among healthy individuals (HI). This study aims to identify PKDL disease specific glycated protein biomarkers, utilizing the powerful LC-MS/MS technology, which is the tool of choice to efficiently identify and quantify disease specific protein biomarkers. These identified PKDL disease specific novel glycoproteins could be developed in future as immunochromatographic based assay for efficient case detection. Methodology: Previously our lab had identified importance of glycated (Circulating Immune Complexes) CICs, among PKDL patients. This study aims to further characterize disease specific glycated protein biomarkers, among MAC PKDL patients for both diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of the disease. LC-MS/MS based comparative spectral count analysis of MAC PKDL to polymorphic (POLY) PKDL, HI, and Cured (CR) individuals were performed. Proteins level alterations among all study groups were confirmed by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbant Assay (ELISA). Results: Among MAC PKDL patients 43, 60, 90 proteins were altered compared to POLY PKDL, HI, and CR groups, respectively. Filtering for the most significant proteins, Plasminogen (PLG) and Vitronectin (VTN) were identified which promisingly identified MAC PKDL cases. Active surveillance results from endemic districts of West Bengal revealed drastic rise of MAC PKDL cases, alarming the urgency for field adaptive efficient biomarker. Conclusion: This current study aims to establish PLG and VTN as novel diagnostic and prognostic protein biomarker for MAC and POLY PKDL cases management.","Jaiswal, Priyank; Ghosh, Manab; Patra, Goutam; Saha, Bibhuti; Mukhopadhyay, Sumi",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.00251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32528904/,311

The crystal structure of eEF1A2 protein purified from rabbit skeletal muscle reveals a post-translationally modified dimer that informs about sites of interaction with numerous binding partners, including itself, and maps these mutations onto the dimer and tetramer interfaces. The spatial locations of the side chain carboxylates of Glu301 and Glu374, to which phosphatidylethanolamine is uniquely attached via an amide bond, define the anchoring points of eEF1A2 to cellular membranes and interorganellar membrane contact sites. Additional bioinformatic and molecular modelling results provide novel structural insight into the demonstrated binding of eEF1A2 to SH3 domains, the common MAPK docking groove, filamentous actin, and phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase IIIβ.

Whereas methods for studying faecal microbiome DNA are plentiful, there is a lack of well-characterised procedures for stabilisation, isolation, and quantitative analysis of faecal host DNA. We report an optimised pipeline for faecal host DNA analysis from the point-of-collection to droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) absolute quantification of host-specific gene targets. We evaluated multiple methods for preservation and isolation of host DNA from stool to identify the highest performing methods. To quantify host DNA even if present in partially degraded form, we developed sensitive, human-specific short-amplicon ddPCR assays targeting repetitive nuclear genomic elements (LINE-1) and mitochondrial genes. We validated the ability of these optimised methods to perform absolute quantification of host DNA in 200 stool DNA extracts from samples that were serially collected from three healthy individuals and three hospitalised patients. These specimens allowed assessment of host DNA day-to-day variability in stool specimens with widely varying physical characteristics (i.e., Bristol scores). We further extended this approach to mouse stool analysis, to enable faecal host DNA studies in animal disease models as well.","He, Kuang; Fujiwara, Hideaki; Zajac, Cynthia; Sandford, Erin; Reddy, Pavan; Choi, Sung Won; Tewari, Muneesh",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41753-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30944341/,311

DATA SOURCES Literature and references on the concept of reflective practice were obtained from two databases: Scopus and Nursing and Allied health database. Peer-reviewed articles published in English language between 2011-2021 that included the terms 'reflection' and/or 'reflective practice' in the title were selected. Seminal pieces of work were also considered in this analysis. A total of 23 works were included. Most of the selected works addressed the concept of reflective practice in nursing education or nursing practice. DATA SYNTHESIS The data analysis integrated the stages identified in Rodgers' method of concept analysis to analyze the concept of reflective practice. Analysis of selected works provided an understanding of common surrogates, antecedents, attributes, and consequences of the concept of reflective practice. CONCLUSIONS Reflective practice is a cognitive skill that demands conscious effort to look at a situation with an awareness of own beliefs, values, and practice enabling nurses to learn from experiences, incorporate that learning in improving patient care outcomes. It also leads to knowledge development in nursing. Considering the current circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper identifies the need for nurses to go beyond reflection-on-action and also include reflection-in-action and reflection-for-action as part of their practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE This analysis identifies the need for future nursing researchers to develop reflective models or strategies that promote reflection among nurses and nursing students before, during, and after the clinical experiences.","Patel, Kiran M; Metersky, Kateryna",International journal of nursing knowledge,https://doi.org/10.1111/2047-3095.12350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34626459/,311

During TPLA, the appendix is suspended with stitches, resulting in perforation risk and difficulty in exploration. AIM We used a needle grasper in TPLA to hang and manipulate the appendix. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty-four patients (10 female, 24 male) who underwent TPLA between February 2015 and November 2015 were analyzed retrospectively for patient demographics, duration of operation, laparotomy or conventional laparoscopy necessity, drain use, complications, and hospital stay periods. The needle grasper was inserted at the right under the abdominal quadrant (McBurney point) without an incision to hang and manipulate the appendix. RESULTS The mean age was 25.19 ±8.464 years; the mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.50 ±3.246 kg/m(2). ASA scores were 1 and 2. The operations were completed without any additional trocar in 34 patients. The mean operation time was 57.03 ±3.814 min. There were no intraoperative complications in any patients. Three patients required a drain; all were discharged after drain removal. Thirty-one patients were discharged on the 1(st) postoperative day; three patients with drains were discharged on the 2(nd) day. The mean hospital stay period was 1.18 ±0.535 days. CONCLUSIONS Using the needle grasper, the appendix was held and suspended and the mesoappendix was cauterized and skeletonized successfully in TPLA. Inserting a needle grasper into the abdominal cavity at the McBurney point to manipulate the appendix helps and does not leave a visible scar.","Donmez, Turgut; Sunamak, Oguzhan; Ferahman, Sina; Uludag, Server Sezgin; Yildirim, Dogan; Hut, Adnan",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2016.60504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27458491/,311

However, the feasibility of Lap-Hx for metastatic liver tumor of colorectal cancer also should be guaranteed oncologically. This study evaluated the short- and long-term outcomes of Lap-Hx compared with open hepatectomy (Open-Hx) for patients with colorectal liver metastasis (CLM) by matched-pair analysis. METHODS This study enrolled 21 patients who underwent Lap-Hx and compared them with 21 matched patients who underwent Open-Hx. The following parameters were matched between the two cohorts: tumor size, tumor location, and operative procedures. Both short- and long-term outcomes of Lap-Hx were compared with those of Open-Hx. RESULTS No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of age, gender, tumor size, or operative procedures. With regard to short-term outcomes, the operative time for Lap-Hx (377 ± 29 min) was similar to that for Open-Hx (369 ± 31 min), whereas the blood loss for the patients who underwent a Lap-Hx (198 ± 39 ml) was significantly less than for those who underwent an Open-Hx (326 ± 50 ml). The incidence of postoperative complications among the patients who underwent Lap-Hx tended to be lower than for the patients who underwent Open-Hx, and intraabdominal abscess was observed only in the Open-Hx group. The hospital stay for Lap-Hx (average, 18.3 days) tended to be shorter than for Open-Hx (27 days). With respect to long-term outcomes, the two groups did not differ significantly in terms of 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates. CONCLUSIONS Lap-Hx is a safe and feasible option for selected patients with CLM. The short- and long-term outcomes of Lap-Hx also are considered to be acceptable.","Iwahashi, Shuichi; Shimada, Mitsuo; Utsunomiya, Tohru; Imura, Satoru; Morine, Yuji; Ikemoto, Tetsuya; Arakawa, Yusuke; Mori, Hiroki; Kanamoto, Mami; Yamada, Shinichiro",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3165-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23996337/,311

The risk of abdominal conditions requiring surgical intervention is not clear, yet submarine and polar base experiences suggest contingency planning is warranted. While radio communication time delay is only 2 s to the international space station (ISS), a potential Mars mission would necessitate time delays of about 15 min. We sought to demonstrate the feasibility of remote expert guidance of diagnostic ultrasound followed by laparoscopic appendectomy in a simulated Mars environment. METHODS Research was deemed exempt by the institutional review board. A simulated Mars research environment was utilized on Devon Island in the Canadian Arctic. Electronic communications including audio and video were established between the Arctic base and Henry Ford Hospital serving as Mission Control and incorporated the 15-min communications lag into all communication. Ultrasound and laparoscopic capabilities were integrated into communications for remote guidance. Remote guidance methods and technology utilized has been previously published in communication with the ISS. A simulated scenario involving a young female astronaut developing right lower quadrant pain was developed and utilized for this demonstration. An anatomical appendectomy model was utilized for the ultrasound and laparoscopic portions. Reference aids describing background technical aspects were developed. A set of confirmation milestones was used to generate a hard stop and mandated remote review. RESULTS The simulated appendectomy was successfully pursued on the first attempt with no delays or untoward events. Reference aids were appropriate for non-surgical personnel and hard stops for milestones with remote approval and go ahead were shown to be feasible. The appendicitis was appropriately diagnosed utilizing remote guidance of ultrasonography and the appendix removed laparoscopically using stapled technique with remote guidance as well. CONCLUSIONS We report a successful remote guidance demonstration from a simulated mars environment with clinical control from a terrestrial base utilizing appropriate delay and consistent bandwidth and technology.","Otto, Christian; Comtois, Jean-Marc; Sargsyan, Ashot; Dulchavsky, Alexandria; Rubinfeld, Ilan; Dulchavsky, Scott",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-0917-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20229213/,311

Restorations were evaluated at 6 months, 1 and 2 years using the ART and the modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria. Chi-square test and Survival Analysis (p<0.05) were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS The success rates for ART restorations were 98.7% (6 months) and 95.8% (1 year) for both criteria. At 2 years, success rate was 92% and 90.3% when scored by the modified USPHS and ART criteria (p=0.466), respectively. The success rates for conventional restorations were 100% (6 months), 98.7% (1 year) and 91.5% (2 years) for both assessment criteria.

136498,Characteristics and 2-year outcomes of dabigatran treatment in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation: GLORIA-AF.,2020-07-02,"PURPOSE To compare the efficacy of an embolization agent with sclerosing properties (made of chitosan and sodium tetradecyl sulfate, CH-STS) with a similar embolization agent but without sclerosing properties (made of chitosan, CH) in treating endoleaks in a canine endovascular aneurysm repair model. METHODS Two chitosan-based radiopaque hydrogels were prepared, one with STS and one without STS. Their rheological, injectability, and embolizing properties were assessed in vitro; afterwards, their efficacy in occluding endoleaks was compared in a canine bilateral aneurysm model reproducing type I endoleaks (n = 9 each). The primary endpoint was endoleak persistence at 3 or 6 months, assessed on a CT scan and macroscopic examination. Secondary endpoints were the occurrence of stent-graft (SG) thrombosis, the evolution of the aneurysm mean diameter, as well as aneurysm healing and inflammation scores in pathology examinations. RESULTS In vitro experiments showed that both products gelled rapidly and presented initial storage moduli greater than 800 Pa, which increased with time. Both gels were compatible with microcatheter injection and occlude flow up to physiological pressure in vitro. In a type I endoleak model, the injection of CH-STS sclerosing gel tended to reduce the risk of occurrence of endoleaks, compared to CH non-sclerosing agent (2/9 vs. 6/9, p = 0.069). No case of SG thrombosis was observed. Moderate inflammation was found around both gels, with a comparable intensity score in both CH and CH-STS groups (2.6 ± 0.9 and 2.7 ± 0.9, respectively; p = 0.789). CONCLUSIONS Flow occlusion combined with chemical endothelial denudation appears promising for the treatment of endoleaks.

In much of the world, the demand for donor tissue heavily outstrips supply. With developments within lamellar corneal graft surgery, the use of split corneal donor tissue to increase donor tissue supply seems a pragmatic solution to reduce the supply and demand mismatch. This is especially important with tissue supply expected to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A literature review of techniques was performed, enabling multiple transplants to be derived from a single donor and simulation of a model to quantify the number of corneas potentially saved. RESULTS Studies on splitting corneal donor tissue have demonstrated that up to 5 recipients may benefit from 1 donor scleral button. The impact of splitting donor tissue may provide a saving of up to 25.3% of donor graft tissue. CONCLUSIONS Splitting and preparing the donor tissue within an eye bank will improve tissue validation and donor tissue availability and may increase surgeon efficiency.","Gadhvi, Kunal A; Coco, Giulia; Pagano, Luca; Kaye, Stephen B; Ferrari, Stefano; Levis, Hannah J; Parekh, Mohit; Romano, Vito",Cornea,https://doi.org/10.1097/ico.0000000000002476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32947412/,311

OBJECTIVE To determine if implementation of the FilmArray rapid respiratory panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, Utah) (hereafter RRP), with a shorter time to the test result and expanded panel, results in different outcomes for children admitted to the hospital with an acute respiratory tract illness. DESIGN Patient outcomes were compared before implementation of the RRP (November 1, 2011, to January 31, 2012) versus after implementation of the RRP (November 1, 2012, to January 31, 2013). The study included inpatients 3 months or older with an acute respiratory tract illness, most admitted through the emergency department. Testing before RRP implementation used batched polymerase chain reaction analysis for respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A and B, with additional testing for parainfluenza 1 through 3 in approximately 11% of patients and for human metapneumovirus in less than 1% of patients. The RRP tested for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1 through 4, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, and coronavirus NL62. RESULTS The pre-RRP group had 365 patients, and the post-RRP group had 771 patients. After RRP implementation, the mean time to the test result was shorter (383 minutes versus 1119 minutes, P < .001), and the percentage of patients with a result in the emergency department was greater (51.6% versus 13.4%, P < .001). There was no difference in whether antibiotics were prescribed, but the duration of antibiotic use was shorter after RRP implementation (P = .003) and was dependent on receiving test results within 4 hours. If the test result was positive, the inpatient length of stay (P = .03) and the time in isolation (P = .03) were decreased after RRP implementation compared with before RRP implementation. CONCLUSIONS The RRP decreases the duration of antibiotic use, the length of inpatient stay, and the time in isolation.","Rogers, Beverly B; Shankar, Prabhu; Jerris, Robert C; Kotzbauer, David; Anderson, Evan J; Watson, J Renee; O'Brien, Lauren A; Uwindatwa, Francine; McNamara, Kelly; Bost, James E",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2014-0257-oa; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25152311/,311
139704,Identification of Patients with Heart Failure in Large Datasets.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Psychotherapy is regarded as the first-line treatment for people with borderline personality disorder. In recent years, several disorder-specific interventions have been developed. This is an update of a review published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in 2006. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of psychological interventions for borderline personality disorder (BPD). SEARCH METHODS We searched the following databases: CENTRAL 2010(3), MEDLINE (1950 to October 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010, week 39), ASSIA (1987 to November 2010), BIOSIS (1985 to October 2010), CINAHL (1982 to October 2010), Dissertation Abstracts International (31 January 2011), National Criminal Justice Reference Service Abstracts (15 October 2010), PsycINFO (1872 to October Week 1 2010), Science Citation Index (1970 to 10 October 2010), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to 10 October 2010), Sociological Abstracts (1963 to October 2010), ZETOC (15 October 2010) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (15 October 2010). In addition, we searched Dissertation Abstracts International in January 2011 and ICTRP in August 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised studies with samples of patients with BPD comparing a specific psychotherapeutic intervention against a control intervention without any specific mode of action or against a comparative specific psychotherapeutic intervention. Outcomes included overall BPD severity, BPD symptoms (DSM-IV criteria), psychopathology associated with but not specific to BPD, attrition and adverse effects. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias in the studies and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS Twenty-eight studies involving a total of 1804 participants with BPD were included. Interventions were classified as comprehensive psychotherapies if they included individual psychotherapy as a substantial part of the treatment programme, or as non-comprehensive if they did not.Among comprehensive psychotherapies, dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT), mentalisation-based treatment in a partial hospitalisation setting (MBT-PH), outpatient MBT (MBT-out), transference-focused therapy (TFP), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy (DDP), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and interpersonal therapy for BPD (IPT-BPD) were tested against a control condition. Direct comparisons of comprehensive psychotherapies included DBT versus client-centered therapy (CCT); schema-focused therapy (SFT) versus TFP; SFT versus SFT plus telephone availability of therapist in case of crisis (SFT+TA); cognitive therapy (CT) versus CCT, and CT versus IPT.Non-comprehensive psychotherapeutic interventions comprised DBT-group skills training only (DBT-ST), emotion regulation group therapy (ERG), schema-focused group therapy (SFT-G), systems training for emotional predictability and problem solving for borderline personality disorder (STEPPS), STEPPS plus individual therapy (STEPPS+IT), manual-assisted cognitive treatment (MACT) and psychoeducation (PE). The only direct comparison of an non-comprehensive psychotherapeutic intervention against another was MACT versus MACT plus therapeutic assessment (MACT+). Inpatient treatment was examined in one study where DBT for PTSD (DBT-PTSD) was compared with a waiting list control. No trials were identified for cognitive analytical therapy (CAT).Data were sparse for individual interventions, and allowed for meta-analytic pooling only for DBT compared with treatment as usual (TAU) for four outcomes. There were moderate to large statistically significant effects indicating a beneficial effect of DBT over TAU for anger (n = 46, two RCTs; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.43 to -0.22; I(2) = 0%), parasuicidality (n = 110, three RCTs; SMD -0.54, 95% CI -0.92 to -0.16; I(2) = 0%) and mental health (n = 74, two RCTs; SMD 0.65, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.24 I(2) = 30%). There was no indication of statistical superiority of DBT over TAU in terms of keeping participants in treatment (n = 252, five RCTs; risk ratio 1.25, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.92).All remaining findings were based on single study estimates of effect. Statistically significant between-group differences for comparisons of psychotherapies against controls were observed for BPD core pathology and associated psychopathology for the following interventions: DBT, DBT-PTSD, MBT-PH, MBT-out, TFP and IPT-BPD. IPT was only indicated as being effective in the treatment of associated depression. No statistically significant effects were found for CBT and DDP interventions on either outcome, with the effect sizes moderate for DDP and small for CBT. For comparisons between different comprehensive psychotherapies, statistically significant superiority was demonstrated for DBT over CCT (core and associated pathology) and SFT over TFP (BPD severity and treatment retention). There were also encouraging results for each of the non-comprehensive psychotherapeutic interventions investigated in terms of both core and associated pathology.No data were available for adverse effects of any psychotherapy. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There are indications of beneficial effects for both comprehensive psychotherapies as well as non-comprehensive psychotherapeutic interventions for BPD core pathology and associated general psychopathology. DBT has been studied most intensely, followed by MBT, TFP, SFT and STEPPS. However, none of the treatments has a very robust evidence base, and there are some concerns regarding the quality of individual studies. Overall, the findings support a substantial role for psychotherapy in the treatment of people with BPD but clearly indicate a need for replicatory studies.","Stoffers, Jutta M; Völlm, Birgit A; Rücker, Gerta; Timmer, Antje; Huband, Nick; Lieb, Klaus",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd005652.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22895952/,311

140105,On the Role of Chest Radiography and CT in the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic.,2020-06-15,"BACKGROUND Hyperglycaemia-induced oxidative damage is a well-established factor implicated in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) in diabetic individuals. Some of the well-known characteristics of DCM include increased myocardial left ventricular wall thickness and remodelling that result in reduced cardiac efficiency. To prevent this, an increasing number of pharmacological compounds such as N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) are explored for their antioxidant properties. A few studies have shown that NAC can ameliorate hyperglycaemia-induced oxidative damage within the heart. Hence, the objective of this review is to synthesise the available evidence pertaining to the cardioprotective role of NAC against hyperglycaemia-induced oxidative damage and thus prevent DCM. METHODS This systematic review protocol will be reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 statement. We will perform a comprehensive search on major databases such as EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PubMed and Google scholar for original research articles published from January 1960 to March 2017. We will only report on literature that is available in English. Two authors will independently screen for eligible studies using pre-defined criteria, and data extraction will be done in duplicate. All discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or consultation of a third reviewer. The quality of studies will be checked using Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool and The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal tools for non-randomised experimental studies. Heterogeneity across studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Q statistic and the inconsistency index (I 2). We will use the random effects model to calculate a pooled estimate. DISCUSSION Although several studies have shown that NAC can ameliorate hyperglycaemia-induced oxidative damage within the heart, this systematic review will be the first pre-registered synthesis of data to identify the cardioprotective potential of NAC against hyperglycaemia-induced oxidative damage. This result will help guide future research evaluating the cardioprotective role of NAC against DCM and better identify possible mechanisms of action for NAC to prevent oxidative damage with a diabetic heart.

142706,Implementation of an Aggressive Enteral Nutrition Protocol and the Effect on Clinical Outcomes.,2017,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae is an obligate pathogen that causes pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, pharyngitis, and asthma in humans. It is well recognized that membrane lipoproteins are immunostimulants exerting as LPS and play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory responses upon M. pneumoniae infection. Here, we report that the M. pneumoniae-derived lipids are another proinflammatory agents. Using an antibody-neutralizing assay, RNA interference, or specific inhibitors, we found that TLR4 is essential for M. pneumoniae lipid-induced TNF-α and IL-1β production. We also demonstrated that NLRP3 inflammasome, autophagy, and NF-κB-dependent pathways are critical for the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, while inhibition of TLR4 significantly abrogates these events. Further characterisation revealed that autophagy-mediated inflammatory responses involved the activation of NF-κB. In addition, the activation of NF-κB also promoted lipid-induced autophagosome formation, as revealed by assays using pharmacological inhibitors, 3-MA and Bay 11-7082, or silencing of atg5 and beclin-1. These findings suggest that, unlike the response to lipoprotein stimulation, the inflammation in response to M. pneumoniae lipids is mediated by the TLR4 pathway, which subsequently initiates the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and formation of a positive feedback loop between autophagy and NF-κB signalling cascade, ultimately promoting TNF-α and Il-1β production in macrophages.","Luo, Haodang; He, Jun; Qin, Lianmei; Chen, Yiwen; Chen, Liesong; Li, Ranhui; Zeng, Yanhua; Zhu, Cuiming; You, Xiaoxing; Wu, Yimou",Clinical and experimental immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/cei.13510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894580/,311

While the neurobiology underwriting the perception of emotions is well studied, the mechanisms for detecting a lack of emotional content in social signals remain largely unknown. Here, using cutting-edge analyses of effective brain connectivity, we uncover the brain networks differentiating neutral and emotional body language. The data indicate greater activation of the right amygdala and midline cerebellar vermis to nonemotional as opposed to emotional body language. Most important, the effective connectivity between the amygdala and insula predicts people's ability to recognize the absence of emotion. These conclusions extend substantially current concepts of emotion perception by suggesting engagement of limbic effective connectivity in recognizing the lack of emotion in body language reading. Furthermore, the outcome may advance the understanding of overly emotional interpretation of social signals in depression or schizophrenia by providing the missing link between body language reading and limbic pathways. The study thus opens an avenue for multidisciplinary research on social cognition and the underlying cerebrocerebellar networks, ranging from animal models to patients with neuropsychiatric conditions.","Sokolov, Arseny A; Zeidman, Peter; Erb, Michael; Pollick, Frank E; Fallgatter, Andreas J; Ryvlin, Philippe; Friston, Karl J; Pavlova, Marina A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2007141117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764147/,311
146221,"Effects of Pneumoperitoneum on Splanchnic Oxygenation during Abdominal Laparoscopic Surgery in Paediatric Patients: A prospective, Observational Study.",2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND Perfusing fixatives through the cerebrovascular system is the gold standard approach in animals to prepare brain tissue for spatial biomolecular profiling, circuit tracing, and ultrastructural studies such as connectomics. Translating these discoveries to humans requires examination of postmortem autopsy brain tissue. Yet banked brain tissue is routinely prepared using immersion fixation, which is a significant barrier to optimal preservation of tissue architecture. The challenges involved in adopting perfusion fixation in brain banks and the extent to which it improves histology quality are not well defined. METHODOLOGY We searched four databases to identify studies that have performed perfusion fixation in human brain tissue and screened the references of the eligible studies to identify further studies. From the included studies, we extracted data about the methods that they used, as well as any data comparing perfusion fixation to immersion fixation. The protocol was preregistered at the Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/cv3ys/ . RESULTS We screened 4489 abstracts, 214 full-text publications, and identified 35 studies that met our inclusion criteria, which collectively reported on the perfusion fixation of 558 human brains. We identified a wide variety of approaches to perfusion fixation, including perfusion fixation of the brain in situ and ex situ, perfusion fixation through different sets of blood vessels, and perfusion fixation with different washout solutions, fixatives, perfusion pressures, and postfixation tissue processing methods. Through a qualitative synthesis of data comparing the outcomes of perfusion and immersion fixation, we found moderate confidence evidence showing that perfusion fixation results in equal or greater subjective histology quality compared to immersion fixation of relatively large volumes of brain tissue, in an equal or shorter amount of time. CONCLUSIONS This manuscript serves as a resource for investigators interested in building upon the methods and results of previous research in designing their own perfusion fixation studies in human brains or other large animal brains. We also suggest several future research directions, such as comparing the in situ and ex situ approaches to perfusion fixation, studying the efficacy of different washout solutions, and elucidating the types of brain donors in which perfusion fixation is likely to result in higher fixation quality than immersion fixation.","McFadden, Whitney C; Walsh, Hadley; Richter, Felix; Soudant, Céline; Bryce, Clare H; Hof, Patrick R; Fowkes, Mary; Crary, John F; McKenzie, Andrew T",Acta neuropathologica communications,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40478-019-0799-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31488214/,311

METHODS We reviewed all LC patients from our institution that were treated from 2004 to 2006 for the occurrence of LC with PM excluding patients with multiple primary LC. RESULTS A total of 444 and 2698 LC patients with and without a history of a PM were identified (prevalence of 14.1%). PM were most often located in breast (15.5%), prostate (14.9%), bladder (9.0%) and kidney (8.8%). Compared to never smokers, patients with nicotine consumption had more often a cancer history of prostate, gastrointestinal, and the head-neck region. The median interval until diagnosis of LC was 72.2 months (range 0-537 months) with most LC diagnosed 5 years after PM diagnosis. With a similar distribution of histology, stage and localization compared to controls, NSCLC patients with PM and stage IV disease showed a favorable overall survival (p < 0.0001). In contrast, SCLC patients had similar survival curves (n.s.). CONCLUSIONS A considerable subgroup of LC patients has a history of PM that may indicate a favorable prognostic factor. However, these patients should be treated similar to other LC patients.","Reinmuth, Niels; Stumpf, Patrick; Stumpf, Andreas; Muley, Thomas; Kobinger, Sonja; Hoffmann, Hans; Herth, Felix J F; Schnabel, Philipp A; Bischoff, Helge; Thomas, Michael",Respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2014.02.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24650574/,311

Despite their clinical relevance, interhemispheric motor control systems have not been completely defined in the developing brain. The objective of this study was to examine the developmental profile of transcallosal inhibition in healthy children and adolescents. Nineteen typically developing right-handed participants were recruited. Two transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigms assessed transcallosal inhibition: ipsilateral silent periods (iSP) and paired-pulse interhemispheric inhibition (IHI). TMS was applied to the motor hotspot of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. Resting motor threshold (RMT), iSP latency, duration and suppression strength, and paired-pulse IHI were measured from both hemispheres. The Purdue Pegboard Test assessed unimanual motor function. Hemispheric differences were evident for RMT and iSP latency and suppression strength, where the left hemisphere had a lower RMT, prolonged latency, and greater suppression strength. iSP duration showed hemispheric symmetry. RMT and iSP latency decreased with age, whereas iSP suppression strength increased. Girls showed shorter iSP latency. Children typically displayed IHI, although hemispheric differences were observed. iSP suppression strength was uniquely associated with IHI within individuals. iSP duration correlated with motor performance. TMS can characterize transcallosal inhibition in normal children and adolescents with effects of age, directionality, sex, and motor performance. Establishing this developmental profile of interhemispheric interactions may advance understanding and therapeutic strategies for pediatric motor disorders such as cerebral palsy.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Here we demonstrate that transcranial magnetic stimulation can characterize transcallosal inhibition in normal children and adolescents with effects of age, directionality, handedness, and motor performance. Interestingly, we also demonstrated sex effects, possibly related to the differing developmental profiles of boys and girls.

Although glucagon-like and insulin-like hormones have been found across animal phyla, incretin-like EEC-derived hormones have not yet been characterised in invertebrates. Here, we show that the midgut-derived hormone, neuropeptide F (NPF), acts as the sugar-responsive, incretin-like hormone in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Secreted NPF is received by NPF receptor in the corpora cardiaca and in insulin-producing cells. NPF-NPFR signalling resulted in the suppression of the glucagon-like hormone production and the enhancement of the insulin-like peptide secretion, eventually promoting lipid anabolism. Similar to the loss of incretin function in mammals, loss of midgut NPF led to significant metabolic dysfunction, accompanied by lipodystrophy, hyperphagia, and hypoglycaemia. These results suggest that enteroendocrine hormones regulate sugar-dependent metabolism through glucagon-like and insulin-like hormones not only in mammals but also in insects.","Yoshinari, Yuto; Kosakamoto, Hina; Kamiyama, Takumi; Hoshino, Ryo; Matsuoka, Rena; Kondo, Shu; Tanimoto, Hiromu; Nakamura, Akira; Obata, Fumiaki; Niwa, Ryusuke",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25146-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34376687/,311

Although patients with autoimmune disease and other comorbidities were excluded from initial clinical trials, emerging real-world experience suggests that these promising treatments may be administered safely to individuals with inactive low-risk autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis, mild to moderate renal and hepatic dysfunction, and certain chronic viral infections. Considerations for ICI in autoimmune disease populations include exacerbations of the underlying autoimmune disease, increased risk of ICI-induced immune-related adverse events, and potential for compromised efficacy if patients are receiving chronic immunosuppression. Immune checkpoint inhibitor use in higher-risk autoimmune conditions, such as myasthenia gravis or multiple sclerosis, requires careful evaluation on a case-by-case basis. Immune checkpoint inhibitor use in individuals with solid organ transplant carries a substantial risk of organ rejection.

The study goals were (1) to develop magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) multiparametric, voxel-based predictive models of infarct core and penumbra in acute ischemic stroke patients, and (2) to develop patient-level imaging criteria for favorable penumbral pattern based on good clinical outcome in response to successful recanalization. METHODS An analysis of imaging and clinical data was performed on 2 cohorts of patients (one screened with CT, the other with MRI) who underwent successful treatment for large vessel, anterior circulation stroke. Subjects were divided 2:1 into derivation and validation cohorts. Pretreatment imaging parameters independently predicting final tissue infarct and final clinical outcome were identified. RESULTS The MRI and CT models were developed and validated from 34 and 32 patients, using 943 320 and 1 236 917 voxels, respectively. The derivation MRI and 2-branch CT models had an overall accuracy of 74% and 80%, respectively, and were independently validated with an accuracy of 71% and 79%, respectively. The imaging criteria of (1) predicted infarct core ≤90 mL and (2) ratio of predicted infarct tissue within the at-risk region ≤70% identified patients as having a favorable penumbral pattern with 78% to 100% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS Multiparametric voxel-based MRI and CT models were developed to predict the extent of infarct core and overall penumbral pattern status in patients with acute ischemic stroke who may be candidates for late recanalization therapies. These models provide an alternative approach to mismatch in predicting ultimate tissue fate.","Kidwell, Chelsea S; Wintermark, Max; De Silva, Deidre A; Schaewe, Timothy J; Jahan, Reza; Starkman, Sidney; Jovin, Tudor; Hom, Jason; Jumaa, Mouhammad; Schreier, Jeffrie; Gornbein, Jeffrey; Liebeskind, David S; Alger, Jeffry R; Saver, Jeffrey L",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.112.670034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23233383/,311

152129,Improving the Uptake of Kangaroo Mother Care in Neonatal Units: A Narrative Review and Proposed Conceptual Framework.,2020-12-02,"BACKGROUND Interscalene nerve blocks provide adequate analgesia, but there are no objective criteria for early assessment of correct catheter placement. In the present study, pulse oximetry technology was used to evaluate changes in the perfusion index (PI) in both blocked and unblocked arms, and changes in the plethysmographic variability index (PVI) were evaluated once mechanical ventilation was instituted. METHODS The PI and PVI values were assessed using a Radical-7™ finger pulse oximetry device (Masimo Corp., Irvine, CA, USA) in both arms of 30 orthopedic patients who received an interscalene catheter at least 25 min before induction of general anesthesia. Data were evaluated at baseline, on application of local anesthetics; five, ten, and 15 min after onset of interscalene nerve blocks; after induction of general anesthesia; before and after a 500 mL colloid fluid challenge; and five minutes thereafter. RESULTS In the 25 patients with successful blocks, the difference between the PI values in the blocked arm and the PI values in the contralateral arm increased within five minutes of the application of the local anesthetics (P < 0.05) and increased progressively until 15 min. After induction of general anesthesia, the PI increased in the unblocked arm while it remained relatively constant in the blocked arm, thus reducing the difference in the PI. A fluid challenge resulted in a decrease in PVI values in both arms. CONCLUSION The perfusion index increases after successful interscalene nerve blockade and may be used as an indicator for successful block placement in awake patients. The PVI values before and after a fluid challenge can be useful to detect changes in preload, and this can be performed in both blocked and unblocked arms.","Sebastiani, Anne; Philippi, Larissa; Boehme, Stefan; Closhen, Dorothea; Schmidtmann, Irene; Scherhag, Anton; Markstaller, Klaus; Engelhard, Kristin; Pestel, Gunther",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-012-9796-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23055034/,311

This study examined the effectiveness and acceptance of SDE compared with traditional education for health science students and explore the potential moderators that could impact the pooled results. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from January 2000 to March 2020 searched on nine electronic databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, ERIC, PsycInfo, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses. The outcomes measured were knowledge, skills with objective assessments, and overall satisfaction with subjective evaluations. The pooled results were calculated using random-model effects and moderators were explored through meta-regression. RESULTS A total of seven RCTs with 594 participants were included. At the posttest level, the pooled effect size of knowledge acquisitions (SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.07-0.32) showed insignificant difference between the SDE and traditional education groups (P=0.207), with low heterogeneity (I2=17.6%). Subgroup analyses observed no factors that significantly impacted the pooled results of knowledge acquisition at the posttest levels (P for interaction>0.05). Knowledge gains from pretest to posttest in SDE groups also did not differ significantly between groups (SMD 0.15, 95% CI -0.22-0.53; P=0.428). The pooled effect size of skills (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.24-0.28; P=0.735) was similarly insignificant. The pooled effect size of overall satisfaction (SMD 0.60, 95% CI 0.38-0.83; P<0.001) significantly favored SDE over traditional education. Incorporating two-group studies without randomizations did not significantly change the overall results of knowledge acquisition at posttest level (SMD -0.002, 95% CI -0.11-0.10; P=0.994), with moderate heterogeneity (I2 =61.9%). CONCLUSIONS SDE was not significantly different from traditional education in effectiveness and had higher satisfaction ratings.

METHODS Children and adolescents (n = 158) who underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis between 1999 and 2001 were retrospectively analysed. Seven years after surgery those patients were interviewed applying a SF-36 questionnaire regarding their quality of life. RESULTS For short term outcomes there was a trend towards reduced specific postoperative complications in the laparoscopically operated group (9.3 vs. 10.7%). Significantly more patients in the laparoscopic group would recommend the operation procedure to family members or friends than in the open group. Among the evaluated patients there was a significantly higher satisfaction concerning size and appearance of their scars in the laparoscopic group.

An individual participant data meta-analysis.,2019,"OBJECT In this study, the authors used information provided in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) to study the impact of transferring stroke patients from one facility to a center where they received some form of active stroke intervention (intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, thrombectomy, or a combination of both therapies). METHODS Patient demographic characteristics and hospital factors obtained from the 2008-2010 acute stroke NIS data were analyzed. Discharge disposition, hospitalization cost, and mortality were the dependent variables studied. Univariate analysis and multivariate binary logistic regression analysis were performed. Data analysis focused on the cohort of acute stroke patients who received some form of active intervention (55,913 of 1,311,511 patients in the NIS). RESULTS When overall outcome was considered, transferred patients had a significantly higher number of other-than-routine (OTR, i.e., other than discharge to home without home health care) discharge dispositions (p < 0.0001). In multivariate regression analysis including pertinent patient and hospital factors, transfer-in patients had significantly worse OTR discharge disposition (p < 0.0001, odds ratio [OR] 2.575, 95% CI 2.341-2.832). Mean hospitalization cost including an intervention was $70,325.11 for direct admissions and $97,546.92 for transferred patients. Transfer from another facility (p < 0.001, OR 1.677, 95% CI 1.548-1.817) was associated with higher hospitalization cost. CONCLUSIONS The study showed that hospital cost for acute stroke intervention is significantly higher for a transferred patient than for a direct admission. Moreover, the frequency of OTR discharge was significantly higher among transferred patients than direct admissions. Future strategies should focus on ways and means of transporting patients appropriately and directly to stroke centers.","Sonig, Ashish; Lin, Ning; Krishna, Chandan; Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Mokin, Maxim; Hopkins, L Nelson; Snyder, Kenneth V; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2015.4.jns141631; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26452123/,311

Immunodeficiency, precariousness and promiscuity could increase the risk of COVID-19 in HIV-infected patients and in preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) users. No epidemiological data are available in these two populations. We report COVID-19 attack rate in HIV-infected patients and in PrEP users in the Rhône department, France, and compared it with the general population. DESIGN Retrospective analysis of a laboratory database. METHODS COVID-19 testing strategy in France was centered on symptomatic infections, hospitalized patients and symptomatic healthcare workers while most asymptomatic cases were not confirmed. SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate on PCR assays and COVID-19 attack rate were determined in HIV-infected patients and in PrEP users. COVID-19 attack rate in the general population was estimated from health authorities' database and demographic data. A corrected attack rate taking into account the laboratory representativeness was calculated. RESULTS From March to April 2020, 24 860 samples from 19 113 patients (HIV-infected 77, PrEP users 27, others 19 009) were assessed for SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay. The positivity rate appeared similar in HIV-infected patients (15.6%), in PrEP users (14.8%) and in other patients (19.1%). The crude/corrected COVID-19 attack rate appeared similar in HIV-infected patients (0.31/0.38%) and in PrEP users (0.38/0.42%), and of the same order as the estimated attack rate in the general population (0.24%). CONCLUSION The risk of symptomatic COVID-19 in France appeared similar in HIV-infected patients and in PrEP users compared with the general population.","Charre, Caroline; Icard, Vinca; Pradat, Pierre; Brochier, Corinne; Lina, Bruno; Chidiac, Christian; Cotte, Laurent",AIDS,https://doi.org/10.1097/qad.0000000000002639; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32889852/,311
159271,Optimal Respiratory Rate for Low-Tidal Volume and Two-Lung Ventilation in Thoracoscopic Bleb Resection.,2015,"CONTEXT Previous studies have correlated poor neurological outcomes with hypotension. Treatment of hypotension in very low birthweight (VLBW) infants is common, and most often is based solely on the blood pressure measurement. Whether treatment improves cerebral oxygenation is unclear. OBJECTIVE To determine if treatment of hypotension in VLBW neonates results in an increase in cerebral oxygenation. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this single centre observational study, neonates <30 weeks and <1500 grams, blood pressure and regional cerebral oximetry (rCSO2) with near infrared spectroscopy were continuously monitored and digitally recorded. If patients were treated for hypotension during the first 3 days of life, effects of treatment on blood pressure and regional cerebral saturation were determined. RESULTS Twenty-eight of 50 patients were treated by the medical team for hypotension, of which 22 had accurate data recorded for analysis. Both normal saline 10 ml/kg, and dopamine 2.5-5 mcg/kg per min significantly increased blood pressure, (saline 26.8±3.5 to 28.8±4.2 mm Hg, p<0.005; dopamine 27.6±1.9 to 29.5±3.2 mm Hg, p<0.02). Pre-treatment values of rCSO2 were similar to published normative values and treatment with either normal saline or dopamine had no effect on rCSO2. CONCLUSION These results suggest that treating hypotension in VLBW neonates based solely on a blood pressure measurement of less than 30 mm Hg, while increasing blood pressure, may not increase cerebral oxygenation, possibly because many of these patients are in the autoregulatory zone for cerebral blood flow.","Garner, Rachel S; Burchfield, David J",Archives of disease in childhood.

MATERIALS AND METHODS From May 2016 to July 2017, patients with liver cancers adjacent to GB (≤10 mm) who intended to undergo ultrasound-guided RFA without GB isolation in our hospital were prospectively enrolled. During the RFA procedures, CEUS was employed to evaluate the therapeutic response and the perfusion of the intact GB wall. The outcomes of GB and liver cancers were followed up and recorded. RESULTS 23 patients (18 male, 5 female) with 23 liver cancers (mean 18 mm, range 8-34 mm) adjacent to GB were enrolled. There were 12 tumors that abutted the GB while 11 tumors located within 10 mm of the GB. After the RFA procedures, intra-procedural CEUS evaluation demonstrated the perfusion of the GB wall was intact in all 23 patients and technical success rate of RFA was 100% (23/23). According to the contrast-enhanced CT/MR one month after RFA, the technical efficacy rate was 100% (23/23). During the follow-up period (range: 12-23 months, median: 17 months), no local tumor progression occurred and no major complications arised. Overall survival at 1-year was 100%. Thickening of GB wall was detected in 11 patients. The thickness of GB wall returned to the pre-ablation level in five patients. CONCLUSION CEUS-monitored RFA of liver cancers adjacent to GB without GB isolation was feasible, safe and effective.","Long, Yinglin; Yan, Ronghua; Li, Kai; Luo, Liping; Zeng, Qingjing; Tan, Lei; Zhang, Man; Zheng, Rongqin; Xu, Erjiao","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.1080/02656736.2018.1539776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30489164/,311

Full surface laser ablation is frequently used to prepare the recipient site before cell suspension transplantation, even though the optimal laser settings and ablation depth are unknown. OBJECTIVES To assess the efficacy and safety of less invasive recipient-site preparations. METHODS In a randomized, observer-blinded, controlled trial we compared different recipient-site preparations before cell suspension transplantation in segmental vitiligo and piebaldism. In each patient, we randomly allocated three CO2 laser recipient-site preparations (209 and 144 μm full surface, and fractional) and a control (no treatment) to four depigmentations. After 6 months we assessed repigmentation and side-effects. RESULTS We included 10 patients with vitiligo (n = 3) and piebaldism (n = 7). Compared with the control site, we found more repigmentation after full surface ablation at 209 μm (median 68·7%, P = 0·01) and 144 μm (median 58·3%, P = 0·007), but no repigmentation after fractional ablation (median 0·0%, P = 0·14). CONCLUSIONS Superficial full surface ablation with a depth of 144 μm is an effective recipient-site preparation before cell suspension transplantation, while fractional CO2 laser is not.","Lommerts, J E; Meesters, A A; Komen, L; Bekkenk, M W; de Rie, M A; Luiten, R M; Wolkerstorfer, A",The British journal of dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjd.15569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28403523/,311

166173,"Low linoleic acid foods with added DHA given to Malawian children with severe acute malnutrition improves cognition: a randomized, triple blinded, controlled clinical trial",2021-09-12,"—The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected people’s lives, changing the ways of working, living, playing, and learning. With this pandemic, classroom learning has been suspended due to infection concerns, and e-learning has emerged, becoming an important mechanism for educational institutions to continue their teaching and learning activities. However, there have been only a few empirical studies providing insight into the factors affecting students’ e-learning satisfaction and usage behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, this study aims to investigate the impact of e-learning quality on student satisfaction and continuance usage intentions among higher education students in Thailand during the pandemic. Based on empirical research with 185 higher education students, the results revealed that e-learning quality was a second-order construct comprised of three elements, namely, course content and design, administrative and technical support, and instructor and learner characteristics. Course content and design was the most important dimension of overall e-learning quality. Furthermore, overall e-learning quality had a significant positive impact on student satisfaction and continuance usage intentions toward e-learning platforms. Mediation analysis indicated that student satisfaction partly mediated the relationship between e-learning quality and continuance usage intentions. © 2021, International Journal of Information and Education Technology.

In order to meet the increasing demand for woody biomass feedstock, the wood pellet mills in the U.S. South consume roundwood pulpwood along with low-valued logging residues and sawmill wood wastes. By estimating empirical roundwood pulpwood market models based on the bi-monthly time-series data, this study estimates the impacts of wood pellet production, precipitation, and the COVID-19 Pandemic on the hardwood and softwood pulpwood stumpage prices in 12 southeastern Atlantic coastal micro-markets. Results suggest that the wood pellet industry has led to an increase in pine pulpwood prices, but no statistically significant impact is found on the hardwood pulpwood prices. Rainfall is found to be a positive determinant of the roundwood pulpwood prices. Furthermore, since March 2020, the COVID-19 Pandemic is estimated to lead about 6% decline in both pine and hardwood pulpwood prices. This study provides empirical evidence and additional insights on the timber market dynamics and how small roundwood markets have reacted to the additional wood demand from a growing bioenergy industry in the U.S. South.","Parajuli, Rajan",Journal of Cleaner Production,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128384,311

Methods We conducted a dose-escalation, open label trial (phase 1) and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (phase 2) to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the Nanocovax vaccine (in 25 microgram (mcg), 50 mcg, and 75 mcg doses, aluminum hydroxide adjuvanted). In phase 1, 60 participants received two intramuscular injection of the vaccine following dose-escalation procedure. The primary outcomes were reactogenicity and laboratory tests to evaluate the vaccine safety. In phase 2 which involved in 560 healthy adults, the primary outcomes are vaccine safety; and anti-S IgG antibody response. Secondary outcomes were surrogate virus neutralization, wild-type SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, and T-cell responses by intracellular staining (ICS) for interferon gamma (IFNg). We performed primary analyses at day 35 and day 42. Results For phase 1 study, no serious adverse events (SAE) were observed for all 60 participants. Most adverse events (AE) were grade 1 and disappeared shortly after injection. For phase 2 study, after randomization, 480 participants were assigned to receive the vaccine with adjuvant, and 80 participants were assigned to receive placebo. Reactogenicity was absent or mild in the majority of participants and of short duration (mean, [≤]3 days). Unsolicited adverse events were mild in most participants. There were no serious adverse events related to Nanocovax. Regarding the immunogenicity, Nanocovax induced robust anti-S antibody responses. There was no statistical difference in antibody responses among dose strengths on Day 42, in terms of anti S-IgG level and neutralizing antibody titer. Conclusions Up to 42 days, Nanocovax vaccine was safe, well tolerated and induced robust immune responses. We propose using Nanocovax 25 mcg for Phase 3 to evaluate the vaccine efficacy.

In this paper, we present an approach to detect suicide ideation on social media based on a BERT-LSTM model with Adversarial and Multi-task learning (BLAM). More specifically, BLAM combines BERT model with Bi-LSTM model to extract deeper and richer features. Furthermore, emotion classification is utilized as an auxiliary task to perform multi-task learning, which enriches the extracted features with emotion information that enhances the identification of suicide. In addition, BLAM generates adversarial noise by adversarial learning improving the generalization ability of the model. Extensive experiments conducted on our collected Suicide Ideation Detection (SID) dataset demonstrate the competitive superiority of BLAM compared with the state-of-the-art methods. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Li, J.; Yan, Z.; Lin, Z.; Liu, X.; Leong, H.

170637,"Smartphone-based videoconference visits are easy to implement, effective, and feasible in Crohn's Disease Patients: A Prospective Cohort Study",2021-03-12,"Despite the fact that more than a year has passed since the WHO declared the pandemic, there is still no effectivetreatment of COVID-19. According to current knowledge, the only method to stop the virus from spreading is prophylactic vaccination of the population. However, to achieve herd immunity, 60-72% of the population needs to be vaccinated, which is a significant challenge for current healthcare systems. As it has already been proven, having an effective vaccine is not the same as using it. Public acceptance is essential here. The study aimed to assess the changes in the attitudes of online respondents toward vaccination against COVID-19 over time. In the research, a questionnaire designed by the author of the study was used and it was distributed via the Internet in two stages. The questionnaire included a section assessing a sociodemographic status as well as the questions, designed by the author, evaluating the willingness of the respondents to get vaccinated and their main concerns associated with it. The first stage covered the period before the commencement of the population vaccination programme in Poland, i.e., 14-27 December 2020. Then, the survey was redistributed 2 months after the vaccination programme was started, i.e., 1-19 March 2021. Participation in the study was fully anonymous, voluntary and there was a possibility to opt out at any stage of the research. A total of 2048 respondents were surveyed and 26 persons refused to be involved in the research. A total number of 2022 responses were analysed. Stage I of the research involved 22.9% of the respondents (463 persons). The questions were answered by 1559 persons (72.9%) after the survey was redistributed. Among the participants of stage II of the study, 422 (27.1%) persons have already been vaccinated against COVID-19. A comparison of the responses that were collected from both stages of the study showed a slight increase in the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 over time. It turned out that women, residents of large cities, people with a higher level of education and healthcare workers showed a more favourable attitude toward vaccination. According to the results of the survey, chronic diseases do not have a significant impact on the attitude toward vaccinations (p = 0.155). As the social vaccination promotion campaign continued, a slight increase in the willingness to get vaccinated was observed. According to the survey, women, residents of large cities and those with higher education demonstrated more favourable attitudes toward getting vaccinated against COVID-19. It should be stressed that despite the passage of time and the increasing experience with the new types of vaccines against COVID-19, the percentage of people who are afraid of the complications after the vaccination has not decreased significantly and the concern related to the ineffectiveness of vaccination has dramatically increased. This demonstrates the limited effectiveness of the current information system regarding passing the knowledge on of the safety and efficiency of vaccination and it indicates a necessity to modernise it as soon as possible.","Babicki, M.; Mastalerz-Migas, A.",Vaccines,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9050503/,311

As governments and firms strategize the sector’s recovery, insights from the sector’s prepandemic period of high growth offer useful policy lessons. This study examines the drivers of the tourism sector’s growth and catch-up performance in 13 industrialized economies over the period 2000–2015, using data from the EU-KLEMS database. The findings have three notable policy implications. First, the tourism sector in most countries experienced significant growth. However, value-added growth was driven largely by labor employment expansion while labor productivity declined in most countries. Second, weak investment in non–information and communications technology (ICT) capital and declining total factor productivity are the principal impediments to labor productivity growth. Third, all countries embraced digital transformation but many lagged on innovation and labor quality. These findings are analyzed to identify policy strategies for the tourism sector’s postpandemic recovery.

172065,Role of the day care unit in the optimal management of heart failure patients,2021,"AimsDuring out of hour handovers at St Charles Hospital – the two duty SHO (senior house officers) cover on site, whereas the on-call registrar and consultant are available to contact by phone. Some trainees may experience difficulties in contacting their seniors for support, or may not feel comfortable doing so. Trainees may also feel like they would benefit from being more informed of the hospital situation, or added learning and educational opportunities from the shift. The aim of this project was to improve the out of hours support for the on-call SHOs – which we hope to have positive short (such as improving confidence and performance) - and longer-term impacts (improving retention in the deanery and specialty).MethodThe project proposed instating a 15-minute Zoom call at the start of each night shift (9:30pm) which involved the on-call team (SHOs, registrar, consultants and ideally bed managers). Firstly – a survey monkey questionnaire was sent to trainees to gain a baseline on how supported/informed/ease and learning opportunities for that shift. The project then piloted three separate Plan Do Study Act cycles of change and collected feedback from trainees after each cycle. Both qualitative feedback and quantitative feedback from trainees were collected in the Likert scale format after each PDSA cycle.ResultResults showed that a key benefit of this call is that any pressing issues can be brought up and addressed. Furthermore, for the benefit of the trainees, generally trainees felt more supported whilst they are on call, and got to know the fellow on call team. In addition, trainees reported feeling more at ease when calling their senior colleagues.ConclusionIt is particularly important for doctors to feel supported and informed during their on call shift, especially in the current climate, where there are fast changes and adaptations taking place due to the pandemic. By adding a short meeting at the beginning of each night shift, doctors in the hospital demonstrated an increase in feeling supported, informed and having educational opportunities during their on call shifts. In the long term, by addressing on call issues and making trainees feel more confident and supported during their shift, is likely to benefit and improve recruitment and retention.","Gez, Mehmet Xu Guang",BJPsych Open,https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.507,311
172564,A system biology approach identifies candidate drugs to reduce mortality in severely ill COVID-19 patients,2021-09-22,"Our episodic memories vary in their specificity, ranging from a mere sense of familiarity to detailed recollection of the initial experience. Recent work suggests that alpha/beta desynchronization promotes information flow through the cortex, tracking the richness in detail of recovered memory representations. At the same time, as we age, memories become less vivid and detailed, which may be reflected in age-related reductions in alpha/beta desynchronization during retrieval. To understand age differences in the specificity of episodic memories, we investigated differences in alpha/beta desynchronization between younger (18–26 years, n = 31) and older (65–76 years, n = 27) adults during item recognition and lure discrimination. Alpha/beta desynchronization increased linearly with the demand for memory specificity, i.e., the requirement to retrieve details for an accurate response, across retrieval situations (correct rejections < item recognition < lure discrimination). Stronger alpha/beta desynchronization was related to memory success, as indicated by reliable activation differences between correct and incorrect memory responses. In line with the assumption of a loss of mnemonic detail in older age, older adults had more difficulties than younger adults to discriminate lures from targets. Importantly, they also showed a reduced modulation of alpha/beta desynchronization across retrieval demands. Together, these results extend previous findings by demonstrating that alpha/beta desynchronization dissociates between item recognition and the retrieval of highly detailed memories as required in lure discrimination, and that age-related impairments in episodic retrieval are accompanied by attenuated modulations in the alpha/beta band. Thus, we provide novel findings suggesting that alpha/beta desynchronization tracks mnemonic specificity and that changes in these oscillatory mechanisms may underlie age-related declines in episodic memory.","Karlsson, Anna E.; Wehrspaun, Claudia C.; Sander, Myriam C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.22.055764,311

173730,COVID-19-Associated Pneumomediastinum and Pneumothorax: A Case Series,2021,"An unprecedented research effort has been undertaken in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This has included the determination of hundreds of crystallographic structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, and numerous virtual screening projects searching large compound libraries for potential drug inhibitors. Unfortunately, these initiatives have had very limited success in producing effective inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 proteins. A reason might be an often overlooked factor in these computational efforts: receptor flexibility. To address this issue we have implemented a computational tool for ensemble docking with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We have extracted representative ensembles of protein conformations from the Protein Data Bank and from in silico molecular dynamics simulations. Twelve pre-computed ensembles of SARS-CoV-2 protein conformations have now been made available for ensemble docking via a user-friendly webserver called DINC-COVID (dinc-covid.kavrakilab.org). We have validated DINC-COVID using data on tested inhibitors of two SARS-CoV-2 proteins, obtaining good correlations between docking-derived binding energies and experimentally-determined binding affinities. Some of the best results have been obtained on a dataset of large ligands resolved via room temperature crystallography, and therefore capturing alternative receptor conformations. In addition, we have shown that the ensembles available in DINC-COVID capture different ranges of receptor flexibility, and that this diversity is useful in finding alternative binding modes of ligands. Overall, our work highlights the importance of accounting for receptor flexibility in docking studies, and provides a platform for the identification of new inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 proteins.","Hall-Swan, Sarah; Devaurs, Didier; Rigo, Mauricio M.; Antunes, Dinler A.; Kavraki, Lydia E.; Zanatta, Geancarlo",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001048252100737X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001048252100737X?v=s5,311

Endothelial branching was found to depend on both soluble ECM and fibroblast. We successfully applied this technology in modeling lung fibrosis via bleomycin induction and test a potential antifibrotic drug in vitro while maintaining fundamental cell-cell interactions in lung tissue. Our human fluorescent lung organoid (hFLO) model accurately represents features of pulmonary fibrosis which were ameliorated by fasudil treatment. We demonstrate a 3D culture method with potential of creating organoids from mature cells, thus opening avenues for disease modeling and regenerative medicine, enhancing understanding of lung cell biology in health and lung disease.","Valdoz, Jonard C.; Franks, Nicholas A.; Cribbs, Collin G.; Jacobs, Dallin J.; Dodson, Ethan L.; Knight, Connor J.; Poulson, P.

186046,Development and Validation of a Scoring System for Predicting Periprocedural Complications During Percutaneous Coronary Interventions of Chronic Total Occlusions: The Prospective Global Registry for the Study of Chronic Total Occlusion Intervention (PROGRESS CTO) Complications Score.,2016,"Connexins, the proteins that form gap junction channels, are polytopic plasma membrane (PM) proteins that traverse the plasma membrane bilayer four times. The insertion of five different connexins into the membrane of the ER was studied by synthesizing connexins in translation- competent cell lysates supplemented with pancreatic ER-derived microsomes, and by expressing connexins in vivo in several eucaryotic cell types. In addition, the subcellular distribution of the connexins was determined. In vitro-synthesis in the presence of microsomes resulted in the signal recognition particle-dependent membrane insertion of the connexins. The membrane insertion of all connexins was accompanied by an efficient proteolytic processing that was dependent on the microsome concentration. Endogenous unprocessed connexins were detectable in the microsomes used, indicating that the pancreatic microsomes serve as a competent recipient in vivo for unprocessed full length connexins. Although oriented with their amino terminus in the cytoplasm, the analysis of the cleavage reaction indicated that an unprecedented processing by signal peptidase resulted in the removal of an amino-terminal portion of the connexins. Variable amounts of similar connexin cleavage products were also identified in the ER membranes of connexin overexpressing cells. The amount generated correlated with the level of protein expression. These results demonstrate that the connexins contain a cryptic signal peptidase cleavage site that can be processed by this enzyme in vitro and in vivo in association with their membrane insertion. Consequently, a specific factor or condition must be required to prevent this aberrant processing of connexins under normal conditions in the cell.",,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2120216/,311

Throughinduction of oxidative stress, it plays a major role in the pathogenesis of several complications in DM. Therefore, new strategies and antioxidants should be implemented inthe treatment of DM. Quercetin is a flavonoid with strong antioxidant capacity found dominantly in vegetables, fruits, leaves, and grains. The current study aimed to investigate quercetin protective effects under D-glucose-induced oxidative stress by assessing antioxidant defense enzymes inHepG2 cells as an in vitro model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HepG2 cells were cultured with different concentrations of D-glucose (5.5, 30 and 50 mM) and/or 25 μM quercetin for 48 and 72 hr, respectively. The effect of treatments on cellular integrity, antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR) activity, andcellular levels of glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) wasdetermined. RESULTS: D-glucose had various effects on intracellular antioxidant defense atdifferent doses and time-points and quercetin could attenuate oxidative stress and modulate antioxidant defenses. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicated that flavonoid quercetin could be proposed as an agent protecting hepatic HepG2 cells against oxidative stress associated with hyperglycemia.","Yarahmadi, Amir; Moradi Sarabi, Mostafa; Sayahi, Ahmad; Zal, Fatemeh",Avicenna J Phytomed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8140214/,311

Fifty-four animals were inoculated intranasally with approximately 10(3.5) median cell culture infectious doses of the 25th passage of SDA virus in L-2 cells. Randomly-selected vaccinated animals were killed in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of attenuated virus by histopathological examination of the salivary glands, lacrimal glands, and lower respiratory tract, and titration of sera for antibody to SDA virus. At three months and six months postvaccination (pv), animals were selected at random and challenged with virulent SDA virus. Seronegative, age-matched animals were also challenged, and served as controls. In animals examined at six to ten days pv, lesions were absent in submandibular and parotid salivary glands and lacrimal glands, but transient lesions were present in major airways of the lower respiratory tract. In a comparison of the incidence and extent of lesions, and antibody titers in challenged vaccinates and seronegative controls, lesions were minimal or absent in vaccinates compared to challenged naive rats, particularly in animals inoculated at three months pv. In addition, antibody titers in challenged vaccinates were much higher than were postinoculation titers in inoculated controls. In a comparison of lesions in salivary and lacrimal glands in vaccinated and control animals challenged at six months pv, there was a significant reduction in the number of animals without lesions in the vaccinated group (p = less than 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Percy, D H; Scott, R A",Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1653100/,311

METHOD It is a systematic review of the literature based on a document request, conducted on PubMed, using the following search equation: ""("" Hand Hygiene ""[All Fields] OR"" Hand Disinfection ""[All Fields]) AND (""Epidemics"" [All Fields] OR ""Pandemics"" [All Fields]) "". All publications related to the effectiveness of the preventive intervention for HH in an epidemic setting were Included. RESULTS A total of 16 publications were included, of which the majority proved the effectiveness of HH and its promotion in reducing infections during an epidemic. In a clinical trial, promoting HH in an intervention group significantly reduced the prevalence of infections (24.4% vs. 11.1%). Two systematic reviews have shown the effectiveness of HH in preventing the transmission of germs with ORs between 0.52 and 0.62. Four case-control studies and three cross-sectional studies concluded with the protective effect of HH with ORs varying between 0.06 and 0.71. A cohort study showed that low adherence to HH recommendations was associated with a higher infection rate (77.5% vs 95%; p = 0.02). A single systematic review did not conclude that HH was effective in the epidemic setting. CONCLUSION The effectiveness of HH in the fight against epidemics has been demonstrated. It is dependent on the engagement and the active participation of the different intervenient. Hence the need to increase accessibility to different methods of HH and to promote the importance of this prevention strategy could be assured through education and awareness.","Hannachi, Hajer; Chelly, Souhir; Ben Hassine, Donia; Chebil, Dhekra; Melki, Sarra; Nouira, Sarra; Merzougui, Latifa; Ben Abdelaziz, Ahmed",La Tunisie medicale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33479973/,311

A total of 2,215 outpatients referred for mind/body complaints were assessed by DSM-III-R or DSM-IV. Somatic symptoms were rated using the Cornell Medical Index Questionnaire. Ninety-one outpatients (4.1%) were diagnosed with major depression. Prevalence of fatigue (86%), insomnia (79%), nausea/vomiting (50%), and back pain (36%) as well as degrees of psychosocial stress (DSM-III-R axis IV) were higher (all p < 0.05) and scores of global assessment of psychosocial functioning (DSM-III-R/DSM-IV axis V) were lower (p < 0.001) in the major depressive patients compared to the remaining outpatients. Among the major depressive patients, the total number of somatic symptoms was larger (p < 0.05) in patients with 'severe' major depressive episodes than in those with 'mild' depressive episodes. These findings suggest that the level of depression is closely linked to the reporting of somatic symptoms in a psychosomatic medicine population.","Nakao, M; Yamanaka, G; Kuboki, T",Psychopathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11799317/,311
190246,Respiratory consequences of rhinovirus infection.,2003,"BACKGROUND Belgium was one of the first European countries affected by the first wave of the Covid-19 epidemic after Italy and France and has the highest rate of Covid-19-related deaths. Very few studies have evaluated the impact of the pandemic on surgical activity on a large scale. The primary objective of this national survey was to evaluate the impact of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic on surgical activities (elective non-oncological and oncological) in Belgian hospitals. METHODS A nationwide, multicenter survey was conducted in Belgium by the Royal Belgian Surgical Society (RBSS) board. The questionnaire focused on digestive surgical activity at different time points: period 1 (P1), before the epidemic; period 2 (P2), lockdown; and period 3 (P3), after stabilization of the epidemic. RESULTS The participation rate in the survey was 28.2% (24 out of 85 solicited hospitals), including 15 (62.5%) from the French speaking part of Belgium and 9 (37.5%) from the Flemish speaking part. Eighteen (75%) were non-academic and 6 (25%) were academic hospitals. All surgical activities were impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic except for the number of cholecystectomies. No statistical differences were observed between regions or according to the type of hospital. CONCLUSIONS Our national survey confirms that the COVID-19 outbreak has severely impacted in-person consultations and surgical activity for benign and malignant disease and for acute appendicitis. However, procedures for benign disease were much more affected than those for malignancies.","Liberale, Gabriel; Van Veer, Hans; Lemaitre, Jean; Duinslager, Marc; Ysebaert, Dirk; De Roover, Arnaud; de Gheldere, Charles; Komen, Niels",Acta chirurgica Belgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34077296/,311
193043,Application of a snare technique in retrograde chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention - a step by step practical approach and an observational study.,2016,"The human genome and other genome sequencing projects have generated huge amounts of protein sequence information. Recently, a structural genomics project that aims to determine at least one representative three-dimensional structure from every protein family experimentally has been started. Homology modeling will play an essential role in structure based drug design such as in silico screening; because based on these representative structures the three-dimensional structures of the remaining proteins encoded in the various genomes can be predicted by homology modeling. The results of the last Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP5) demonstrated that the quality of homology modeling prediction has improved; reaching a level of reliability that biologists can now confidently use homology modeling. With improvements in modeling software and the growing number of known protein structures, homology modeling is becoming a more and more powerful and reliable tool. The present paper discusses the features and roles of homology modeling in structure based drug design, and describes the CHIMERA and FAMS modeling systems as examples. For a sample application, homology modeling of non-structural proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus is discussed. Many biological functions involve formation of protein-protein complexes; in which the protein molecules behave dynamically in the course of binding. Therefore, an understanding of protein-protein interaction will be very important for structure based drug design. To this end, normal mode analysis is useful. The present paper discusses the prediction of protein-protein interaction using normal mode analysis and examples of applications are given.","Takeda-Shitaka, Mayuko; Takaya, Daisuke; Chiba, Chieko; Tanaka, Hirokazu; Umeyama, Hideaki",Current medicinal chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15032603/,311

Significantly higher percentages of antibody carriers were obtained during testing randomly collected sera from mature males (greater than 1 year old) than in testing females of the same age. Antibodies were infrequently found in immature cats (less than 6 months old); at 1 year of age or older, a plateau was reached and little change in the percentage of seroconverted animals was observed. Differences were not detected between purebred cats vs mixed-breed cats or household vs stray cats. In animals showing clinical signs of feline infection peritonitis (FIP), antibodies were encountered with higher frequency than in clinically healthy cats. Significant differences in antibody incidence were found between countries, with a range between less than 10% and greater than 50% of seropositive individuals. Antibodies were detected in sera from an isolated cat population (Marion Island) and from wild-caught cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). The antibody specificity for FIP virus was confirmed by neutralization tests. The antibody pattern in randomly collected solitary cats, in catteries, and cats with clinical FIP showed characteristic differences in titer and incidence. The implications of these results for the epizootiology of FIP are discussed.","Horzinek, M C; Osterhaus, A D",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/230758/,311

We have characterized the effects of these polymorphisms on the ability of DC-SIGNR to form tetramers containing the clusters of sugar-binding sites needed for binding to viral envelope glycoproteins. Chemical cross-linking and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments have been used to show that only the smallest form of DC-SIGNR is defective in homotetramer assembly. A novel affinity-tagging approach has been employed to demonstrate that, contrary to previous speculation, heterotetramers can be assembled efficiently from DC-SIGNR polypeptides of different lengths. The heterotetramers are stable and can be detected in fibroblasts transfected with multiple forms of DC-SIGNR. These results provide a molecular basis for interpreting the way polymorphisms affect interactions with viruses.","Guo, Yuan; Atkinson, Claire E; Taylor, Maureen E; Drickamer, Kurt",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16621794/,311

Actinomycin D (Act D) is an antibiotic that intercalates DNA and therefore inhibits DNA-dependent transcription. The current study was carried out to assess the influence of Act D on the replication of simian rotavirus (SA11) in cell culture. Virus-infected MA-104 cell cultures were studied in the presence of Act D at concentrations of 1.25 and 2.5 microg/ml. Treatment of rotavirus-infected cells with 2.5 microg/ml Act D 48 h post-infection reduced the cytoplasmic metachromasia after staining with acridine orange by 25%. Viral RNA labeled with 3H-uridine in the presence of the drug was separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Viral RNA replication was not affected by Act D, but increased 3H-uridine uptake was demonstrable by infected cells in the presence of the drug. This possibly was due to the inhibition of cellular RNA synthesis by Act D, which thus enhances incorporation of the radionuclide into the viral RNA. Act D reduced the number of infected cells presenting virus-specific fluorescence 48 h post-infection by more than 50%. These data suggest that Act D may have complexed with viral RNA and prevented newly synthesized mRNA from being translated, but may not have prevented early replication.","Stefanelli, C C; Castilho, J G; Botelho, M V J; Linhares, R E C; Nozawa, C M",Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11960193/,311

Overexpression of MHVR from vaccinia vectors during an ongoing MHV infection resulted in dramatic inhibition of virus production. Infectivity in both cytoplasmic extracts and supernatants was reduced by over three orders of magnitude relative to control cultures in which a truncated MHVR lacking virus binding activity was expressed. Complete MHV virions were not detectable in supernatants of MHVR expressing cells. In the presence of overexpressed MHVR, the coronavirus spike protein was not cleaved into posttranslation products S1 and S2, nor was it fully processed into a form resistant to endoglycosidase H digestion, indicating that intracellular engagement of spike with receptor prevented spike transport and consequent association with virions.","Gallagher, T M",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8830503/,311

203642,Experience from a COVID-19 first-line referral clinic in Greater Copenhagen,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Both intrauterine and intrapartum mother-to-child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported. However, there is still disagreement as to the likelihood and frequency of such vertical transmission. OBJECTIVE: Summarize and analyze the published evidence on forms of SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission (either intrauterine or intrapartum). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We carried out a review of literature published in English and Spanish from January 1, 2020 through October 30, 2020. Search engines included PubMed/MEDLINE, SciELO, LILACS, Cochrane, Google Scholar, ResearchGate and medRxiv. There were no restrictions concerning type of study. The review included 48 original research articles, 11 review articles, a meta-analysis, 2 pre-published articles, 15 systematic reviews, and 10 editorials or comments. DEVELOPMENT: Medical thinking on congenital or intrapartum maternal-fetal/neonatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has evolved from preliminary evidence that was divided as to whether these forms of vertical transmission were even possible to current evidence support ing both forms of transmission and hypothesizing as to the mechanisms that guide them. The presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in maternal, placental, fetal or neonatal tissues has been demonstrated by RT-PCR, specific immunoglobulin detection tests, immunostaining and in-situ hybridization. It is estimated that infections acquired either congenitally or intrapartum occur in 1.8%-8.0% of newborns born to women who test positive for COVID-19 at the end of their pregnancies. This review found 53 neonates who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the first 48 hours of life by either RT-PCR or specific IgM tests. According to criteria outlined in this review, the timing of infection corresponded to congenital or intrapartum transmission in 39.6% (21/53) of COVID-19-positive newborns, to postpartum transmission in 15.1% (8/53) and remains unspecified in 45.3% (24/53). CONCLUSIONS: Congenital and intrapartum SARS-CoV-2 infection in the fetus/newborn is possible, but rare. International collaborative studies using common epidemiological surveillance instruments would allow for a more precise specification of the frequency of congenital and intrapartum SARS-CoV-2 infection at the population level.","Robaina-Castellanos, Gerardo Rogelio; Riesgo-Rodríguez, Solangel de la Caridad",MEDICC Rev,,311

It is leading to a huge number of deaths per day. Few researchers have been attracted to analyzing the mortality rate of COVID-19 from various perspectives. During the research, it has become evident that these fatalities are not only caused by COVID-19, but they are also affected by some other factors. The authors of this paper aim to encompass three important types of factors viz. risk factors, clinical factors, and miscellaneous factors that influence the mortality of COVID-19. This manuscript presents a rule-based model under the Mamdani-based fuzzy expert system (FES) to analyze the mortality rate of the highly contagious COVID-19. The proposed model creates three FESs and thereafter generates the final FES which aggregates these three FESs. The FES for risk value considers 5 aggregate factors viz. immunity, temperature, ventilation, population density, and pollution. The second FES is to model the clinical facilities based on ICU count, quarantine centers, and tests performed. The third FES is created to model the miscellaneous factors. Finally, the concluding FES combines three base FESs to evaluate the mortality value. The results obtained by the suggested model are promising and hence advocate the efficacy of the proposed model.

Currently, limited prophylactic or therapeutic intervention options are available against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, 400 compounds from the antimicrobial ""pandemic response box"" library were screened for inhibiting properties against SARS-CoV-2. An initial screen on Vero E6 cells identified five compounds that inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication. However, validation of the selected hits in a human lung cell line highlighted that only a single compound, namely Retro-2.1, efficiently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication. Additional analysis revealed that the antiviral activity of Retro-2.1 occurs at a post-entry stage of the viral replication cycle. Combined, these data demonstrate that stringent in vitro screening of preselected compounds in multiple cell lines refines the rapid identification of new potential antiviral candidate drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2.","Holwerda, Melle; V039,; kovski, Philip; Wider, Manon; Thiel, Volker; Dijkman, Ronald",,,311

We aimed to determine whether development of significant liver injury during hospitalization is related to concomitant medications or processes common in COVID-19 (e.g. ischemia, hyperinflammatory or hypercoagulable states) and to determine whether it can result in liver failure and death. METHODS: 834 consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were included. Clinical, medication and laboratory data were obtained at admission and throughout hospitalization using an identified database. Significant liver injury was defined as an AST&#8805; 5X ULN; ischemia was defined as vasopressor use for a minimum of 2 consecutive days; hyper-inflammatory state as hs-CRP &#8805;100mg/L and hypercoagulability as D-dimer &#8805;5mg/L, any time during hospitalization. RESULTS: 105 (12.6%) patients developed significant liver injury. Compared to those without significant liver injury, ischemia [OR 4.3 (2.5-7.4, p <0.0001)] and tocilizumab use [OR 3.6 (1.9-7.0, p=0.0001)] were independent predictors of significant liver injury. While AST correlated closely with ALT (R=0.89) throughout hospitalization, AST did not correlate with INR (R= 0.10) or with bilirubin (R=0.09). Death during hospitalization occurred in 136 (16.3%) patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed that significant liver injury was not associated with death [OR 1.4 (0.8-2.6, p=0.2)], while ischemic [OR 2.4 (1.4-4.0, p=0.001)] hypercoagulable [OR 1.7 (1.1-2.6, p=0.02)], and hyperinflammatory [OR 1.9 (1.2-3.1, p=0.02)] disease states were significant predictors of death. CONCLUSIONS: Liver test abnormalities known to be associated with COVID-19 are secondary to other insults, mostly ischemia or drug-induced liver injury, and do not lead to liver insufficiency or death.","Chew, Michael; Tang, Zeyu; Radcliffe, Christopher; Caruana, Dennis; Doilicho, Natty; Ciarleglio, Maria M; Deng, Yanhong; Tsao, Guadalupe Garcia-",Clin. gastroenterol. hepatol,,311

The S protein is likely the most complicated of all viral glycoproteins and is a key factor in immunological responses and virus pathogenesis. It is also the driving force dictating virus entry mechanisms, which are highly 'plastic' for coronaviruses, allowing a plethora of options for different virus variants and strains in different cell types. Here we review coronavirus entry as a foundation for current work on SARS-CoV-2. We focus on the post-receptor binding events and cellular pathways that direct the membrane fusion events necessary for genome delivery, including S proteolytic priming and activation.

METHODS: COVID-19 cases and deaths from 28 February to 21 May 2020 of 37 WHO European countries were aggregated into 12 consecutive weeks. The fuzzy C-means clustering was performed to identify similar countries in COVID-19 incidence and mortality rate. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and log-log linear regression analyses were performed to set up relation between COVID-19 mortality rate and age. Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) test was used to explore differences between countries possessing higher mortality rate and age. RESULTS: Based on the highest value of the coefficient of overall separation five clusters of similar countries were identified for incidence rate, mortality rate and in total. Analysis according to weeks offered trends where progress of COVID-19 incidence and mortality rate was visible. Pearson coefficient (0.69) suggested moderately strong connection between mortality rate and age, Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) test proved statistically significant differences between countries experiencing higher mortality rate and age vs. countries having both indicators lower (p < 0.001). Log-log linear regression analysis defined every increase in life expectancy at birth in total by 1% meant growth in mortality rate by 22% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Spain, Belgium and Ireland, closely followed by Sweden and Great Britain were identified as the worst countries in terms of incidence and mortality rate in the monitored period. Luxembourg, Belarus and Moldova accompanied the group of the worst countries in terms of incidence rate and Italy, France and the Netherland in terms of mortality rate. Correlation analysis and the Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) test proved statistically significant positive relationship between mortality rate and age. Log-log linear regression analysis proved that higher age accelerated the growth of mortality rate.","Zach, Hana; Hanová, Martina; Letkovicová, Mária",Cent Eur J Public Health,,311

OBJECTIVE: To objectively evaluate the effects of RPE including medical masks and respirators on the skin barrier by measuring various physiological properties of the skin. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed. Twenty healthy healthcare workers were included in this study. Skin parameters including skin hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), erythema, sebum secretion, pH, and skin temperature were measured in the RPE-covered and RPE-uncovered areas of the face 4 and 8 hours after wearing RPE and 14 hours after not wearing RPE. RESULTS: Skin hydration, TEWL, erythema, pH, and skin temperature increased in the RPE-covered areas after wearing RPE for 4 and 8 hours. By contrast, in the RPE-uncovered areas, skin hydration decreased and TEWL, erythema, and pH showed minimal changes over time. Based on the repeated-measure analysis, the changes in skin physiological properties over time were significantly different between RPE-covered and RPE-uncovered areas. CONCLUSION: We observed that skin physiological characteristics change with the prolonged use of RPE such as medical masks and respirators. These changes may lead to various adverse skin reactions after long-term use.","Han, Hye Sung; Shin, Sun Hye; Park, Jae Wan; Li, Kapsok; Kim, Beom Joon; Yoo, Kwang Ho",Contact dermat,,311

The aims of this paper were (I) to analyze the directives provided to pharmacists in 2020 regarding preventative safety measures to be adopted; (II) to determine the number of pharmacists who came into contact with SARS-CoV-2 in North-West Italy and relate this to the adopted preventative measures. The first aim was pursued by conducting a bibliographic research, consulting the principal regulatory sources. The second one was achieved with an observational study by administering a questionnaire and performing a serological test. The various protection measures imposed by national and regional legislation were analyzed. Two hundred and eighty-six pharmacists (about 8% of the invited ones) responded to the survey. Ten pharmacists reported a positive result to the serological test. Of the subjects who presented a positive result, three declared that they had not used a hand sanitizer, while two stated that they had not scheduled the cleaning and decontamination of surfaces. Two interviewees had not set up a system of quota restrictions on admissions. In four cases, a certified cleaning company had decontaminated the premises. The results of our study show that during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the most pressing challenge for community pharmacists has been the protection of staff and clients inside the pharmacy; the challenge to be faced in the near future will probably be the management of new responsibilities.","Baratta, Francesca; Visentin, Giulio Mario; Ravetto Enri, Lorenzo; Parente, Marco; Pignata, Irene; Venuti, Francesco; Di Perri, Giovanni; Brusa, Paola",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,311

Countries will face substantial health, economic and social burden deriving from vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) such as influenza, pneumonia and herpes zoster in older adults. It will be essential that countries utilize several public health strategies, including immunization. Understanding the different approaches countries have taken on adult immunization could help provide future learnings and technical support for adult vaccines within life-course immunization strategies. In this study, we describe the priorities and approaches that underlie adult immunization decision-making and implementation processes in 32 high-and-middle-income countries and two territories (""34 countries"") who recommend adult vaccines in their national schedule. We conducted an archetype analysis based on a subset of two dozen indicators abstracted from a larger database. The analysis was based on a mixed-methods study, including results from 120 key informant interviews in six countries and a landscape review of secondary data from 34 countries. We found four distinct archetypes: disease prevention-focused; health security-focused; evolving adult focus; and, child-focused and cost-sensitive. The highest performing countries belonged to the disease prevention-focused and health security archetypes, although there was a range of performance within each archetype. Considering common barriers and facilitators of decision-making and implementation of adult vaccines within a primary archetype could help provide a framework for strategies to support countries with similar needs and approaches. It can also help in developing context-specific policies and guidance, including for countries prioritizing adult immunization programs in light of COVID-19. Further research may be beneficial to further refine archetypes and expand the understanding of what influences success within them. This can help advance policies and action that will improve vaccine access for older adults and build a stronger appreciation of the value of immunization amongst a variety of stakeholders.","Privor-Dumm, Lois; Vasudevan, Prarthana; Kobayashi, Kana; Gupta, Jaya",Vaccine,,311

Thus far, the genetic background has remained unknown. Among 726 children consecutively diagnosed with BCP-ALL, 8% patients experienced switch detectable by flow cytometry (FC). Using exome and RNA sequencing, switch was found to positively correlate with three different genetic subtypes: PAX5-P80R mutation (5 cases with switch out of 5), rearranged DUX4 (DUX4r; 30 cases of 41) and rearranged ZNF384 (ZNF384r; 4 cases of 10). Expression profiles or phenotypic patterns correlated with genotypes, but within each genotype they could not identify cases who subsequently switched. If switching was not taken into account, the B-cell-oriented FC assessment underestimated the minimal residual disease level. For patients with PAX5-P80R, a discordance between FC-determined and PCR-determined MRD was found on day 15, resulting from a rapid loss of the B-cell phenotype. Discordance on day 33 was observed in all the DUX4r, PAX5-P80R and ZNF384r subtypes. Importantly, despite the substantial phenotypic changes, possibly even challenging the appropriateness of BCP-ALL therapy, the monocytic switch was not associated with a higher incidence of relapse and poorer prognosis in patients undergoing standard ALL treatment.","Novakova, Michaela; Zaliova, Marketa; Fiser, Karel; Vakrmanova, Barbora; Slamova, Lucie; Musilova, Alena; Brüggemann, Monika; Ritgen, Matthias; Fronkova, Eva; Kalina, Tomas; Stary, Jan; Winkowska, Lucie; Svec, Peter; Kolenova, Alexandra; Stuchly, Jan; Zuna, Jan; Trka, Jan; Hrusak, Ondrej; Mejstrikova, Ester",,,311

217582,Role of High Resolution Computed Tomography chest in the diagnosis and evaluation of COVID -19 patients -A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"Air pollution is one of the main causes of damages to human health in Europe, with an estimate of about 380 000 premature deaths per year in the EU28, as the result of exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) only. In this work, we focus on one specific region in Europe, the Po basin, a region where chemical regimes are the most complex, showing important non-linear processes, especially those related to interactions between NOx and NH3. We analyse the sensitivity of PM2.5 concentration to NOx and NH3 emissions by means of a set of EMEP model simulations performed with different levels of emission reductions, from 25 % up to a total switch-off of those emissions. Both single and combined precursor reduction scenarios are applied to determine the most efficient emission reduction strategies and quantify the interactions between NOx and NH3 emission reductions. The results confirmed the peculiarity of secondary PM2.5 formation in the Po basin, characterised by contrasting chemical regimes within distances of a few (hundred) kilometres, as well as non-linear responses to emission reductions during wintertime. One of the striking results is the slight increase in the PM2.5 concentration levels when NOx emission reductions are applied in NOx-rich areas, such as the surroundings of Bergamo. The increased oxidative capacity of the atmosphere is the cause of the increase in PM2.5 induced by a reduction in NOx emission. This process could have contributed to the absence of a significant PM2.5 concentration decrease during the COVID-19 lockdowns in many European cities. It is important to account for this process when designing air quality plans, since it could well lead to transitionary increases in PM2.5 at some locations in winter as NOx emission reduction measures are gradually implemented. While PM2.5 chemical regimes, determined by the relative importance of the NOx vs. NH3 responses to emission reductions, show large variations seasonally and spatially, they are not very sensitive to moderate (up to 50 %–60 %) emission reductions. Beyond 25 % emission reduction strength, responses of PM2.5 concentrations to NOx emission reductions become non-linear in certain areas of the Po basin mainly during wintertime.","Thunis, Philippe Clappier Alain Beekmann Matthias Putaud Jean Philippe Cuvelier Cornelis Madrazo Jessie de Meij Alexander",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,,311

Design/methodology/approach: To gain fresh insights on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chain social sustainability and resilience issues, an extensive literature review was conducted. To this end, recent scholarly research articles, articles from practitioner journals, magazine articles and policy documents and reports, as well as blogs and briefings published by international organizations were critically reviewed. Findings: The findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a major shake-up of global supply chain operations and has contributed to varied sustainability outcomes. While the pandemic caused reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, it has had serious social implications for the livelihoods and well-being of workers and their families. The findings further suggested that it is imperative for companies to build resilience in their global supply chain operations to better respond to future shocks and disruptions by adopting strategies such as employee protection schemes, advanced digital technologies, diversification, localization and regionalization and stakeholder collaboration. Originality/value: This review paper contributes to emerging global supply chain sustainability literature and practice by synthesizing and explicating the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chain social sustainability and resilience. In addition, this paper offers some practical recommendations to enhance the social sustainability impacts and resilience of global supply chains in a post-COVID world. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Sajjad, A.",Corporate Governance (Bingley),,311
221247,"Clinical Characteristics and Risk Factors of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation in Patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China",2020,"Introduction: the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global pandemic has caused serious disruption to almost all aspect of human endeavor forcing countries to implement unprecedented public health measures aimed at mitigating its effects, such as total lockdown (inter and intra), travel bans, quarantine, social distancing in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. Supportive supervision is a functional component of the immunization systems that allows identification of existing gaps, provides an opportunity for onsite training, and document real-time findings for improvement of the program. The control measures of COVID-19 pandemic have also resulted in limitation of operations of the immunization system including supportive supervision. This has limited many aspects of supportive supervision for surveillance and routine immunization monitoring system in the East and Southern African countries. The aim of this study is to identify the effects of COVID-19 on Integrated Supportive Supervision visits for expanded programme on immunization (EPI) and how it influences the immunization and vaccine preventable disease (VPD) surveillance indicators, and its short-term effect towards notification of increase or decrease morbidity and mortality. Methods: we reviewed the integrated supportive supervision (ISS) data and the routine administrative coverage from 19 countries in the East and Southern Africa (ESA) for the period January to August 2019 to analyze the trends in the number of visits, vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD), and routine immunization (RI) indicators using t-test, and compare with the period January to August 2020 during the months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: thirteen countries out of the 19 considered, had shown a decline in the number of integrated supportive supervision (ISS) visits, with 10 (77%) having more than 59% decrease during the January-August 2020 as compared to the same period 2019. Eleven (57%) of the countries have shown a decrease (p-value < 0.05). Ethiopia and Kenya had the highest drop (p-value < 0.000). Six (32%) had an increase in the number of visits, with Madagascar, Zambia, and Zimbabwe having >100% increase in the number of visits. Sixty-seven percent (67%) of the countries that have decreased in the number of ISS visits have equally witnessed a drop in DPT3 administrative coverage. Countries with a low proportion of outreach sessions conducted in the period of January - August 2020, have all had sessions interruption, with more than 40% of the reasons associated with the lockdown. Conclusion: countries have experienced a decrease in the number of supportive supervision visits conducted, during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic and, this has influenced the routine immunization and vaccine-preventable diseases surveillance (VPD) process indicators monitored through the conduct of the visits. Continuous decrease in these performance indicators pose a great threat to the performance sustained and the functionality of the surveillance and immunization system, and consequently on increased surveillance sensitivity to promptly detect outbreaks and aiming to reducing morbidity and mortality in the sub-region.","Bello, Isah Mohammed; Lebo, Emmaculate; Shibeshi, Messeret Eshetu; Akpan, Godwin Ubong; Chakauya, Jethro; Masresha, Balcha Girma; Daniel, Fussum",Pan Afr Med J,,311
221745,Hospital visiting policies in the time of COVID-19: A nationwide website survey in Taiwan,2020,"In around 10% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19) symptoms are complicated with a severe lung damage called Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which is often lethal. ARDS is mainly associated with an uncontrolled overproduction of immune cells and cytokines, called ""cytokine storm syndrome""; it appears 7-15 days following the onset of symptoms, leading to systemic inflammation and multiple organ failure. Because they are well-known metabolic precursors of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 LC-PUFAs) could help improve the resolution of the inflammatory balance, limiting therefore the level and duration of the critical inflammatory period. Omega-3 LC-PUFAs may also interact at different stages of the viral infection, notably on the virus entry and replication. In the absence of demonstrated treatment and while waiting for vaccine possibility, the use of omega-3 LC-PUFAs deserve therefore to be considered, based on previous clinical studies suggesting that omega-3 supplementation could improve clinical outcomes of critically ill patients at the acute phase of ARDS. In this context, it is crucial to remind that the omega-3 PUFA dietary intake levels in Western countries remains largely below the current recommendations, considering both the omega-3 precursor &#945;-linolenic acid (ALA) and long chain derivatives such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). An optimized omega-3 PUFAs status could be helpful to prevent infectious diseases, including Covid-19.","Weill, Pierre; Plissonneau, Claire; Legrand, Philippe; Rioux, Vincent; Thibault, Ronan",Biochimie,,311

This study aims to determine differences in the serum 25(OH)D concentrations of Arab Gulf adult residents screened for SARS-CoV-2 and its association with risk of COVID-19 infection together with other comorbidities. METHODS: In this multi-center, case-control study, a total of 220 male and female adults presenting with none to mild symptoms were screened for COVID-19 (n = 138 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive and 82 negative controls). Medical history was noted. Anthropometrics were measured and non-fasting blood samples were collected for the assessment of glucose, lipids, inflammatory markers and serum 25(OH)D concentrations. RESULTS: Serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in the SARS-CoV-2 positive group compared to the negative group after adjustment for age and BMI (52.8 nmol/l ± 11.0 versus 64.5 nmol/l ± 11.1; p = 0.009).

224244,Chest CT findings related to mortality of patients with COVID-19: A retrospective case-series study,2020,"Abstract Introduction The COVID-19 outbreak has involved a permanent and significant increase of fear and worries related to the virus and the measures taken to avoid contagion, such as confinement. Objective To explore the relationship between emotional responses and coping strategies used to face the first confinement among the Mexican adult population and inquire about differences by sex. Method An exploratory study was conducted through a self-administered online survey. It included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, emotions about pandemic information, and coping strategies. An informed consent form was presented prior to data collection. Chi square and Kruskal-Wallis were performed for bivariate analyses. Results A total of 2,650 participants completed the survey (21.6% were men). Significantly more men than women reported feeling calm (p &lt; .001), hopeful (p = .011), and indifferent (p = .002). In contrast, more women, compared to men significantly reported feeling worried (p &lt; .001), fearful (p &lt; 0.001), and sad (p &lt; .001). More women reported being emotionally close to other people (p = .027), seeking help from friends and family to share emotions and concerns (p &lt; .001), and they frequently prayed as a coping strategy regardless of their emotions (p = .005). Discussion and conclusion While women are the least affected by the contagion and their symptoms are milder than in men, they present the most negative emotions, particularly of worry, but they also used more caring and helpful behaviors in comparison with men. These results can serve as a basis for developing research with a gender perspective that delves into the differences by sex found in this study.","Ramos-Lira, Luciana; Rafful, Claudia; Flores-Celis, Karla; Mora Ríos, Jazmín; García-Andrade, Consuelo; Rascón Gasca, María Luisa; Bautista Aguilar, Natalia; Cervantes Muñoz, Consuelo",Salud ment,,311

We examined how the pandemic and its social consequences may differentially impact sexual minority adults, relative to heterosexual adults. Methods: Data are from a U.S. national sample of adults (n = 2996; 18.06%) collected from online panels from April to May 2020. We used eight indicators of well-being-mental health, physical health, quality of life, stress, loneliness, psychological distress, alcohol use, and fatigue-to assess the degree to which sexual identity subgroups (i.e., heterosexual, gay/lesbian, bisexual, and ""other"" sexual minority) varied in retrospective pre- and postpandemic onset indicators of well-being and whether groups varied in their rate of change from pre- and postpandemic onset. Results: The results showed consistent patterns of decline in well-being across sexual identity subgroups, although changes in mental health, physical health, quality of life, stress, and psychological distress were more robust among sexual minority adults in general, relative to heterosexual adults. Adjusted multivariate models testing differences in change in retrospective pre- and postpandemic onset found that well-being among bisexual men and women was most negatively impacted by the pandemic. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic may have distinct health consequences for sexual minority adults in the United States. Our findings support and further legitimize calls for more comprehensive surveillance and cultural responsiveness in emergency preparedness as it relates to sexual minority people and the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fish, Jessica N; Salerno, John; Williams, Natasha D; Rinderknecht, R Gordon; Drotning, Kelsey J; Sayer, Liana; Doan, Long",LGBT Health,,311
225594,The effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on clinical and biochemical parameters of critically ill patients with COVID-19: a randomized clinical trial,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Relevant guidelines and consensuses for COVID-19 contain recommendations aimed at optimising the management in paediatric wards. The goal of this study was to determine the quality of those recommendations and provide suggestions to hospital managers for the adjustment of existing hospital prevention and control strategies, and also to offer recommendations for further research. DESIGN: A rapid review of the guidelines and consensuses for the management in paediatric wards facing COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, UpToDate, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Wanfang database and relevant websites such as medlive.cn, dxy.cn, the National Health and Health Commission and the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention were systematically searched through late May 2020. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) tool was then used to assess the quality of the selected articles and summarise the relevant evidence concerning management in paediatric wards. RESULTS: A total of 35 articles were included, composed of 3 consensus guidelines, 25 expert consensuses and 7 expert opinions. Of the 35 papers, 24 were from China, 2 from the USA, 1 from Spain, 1 from Brazil, 1 from Saudi Arabia and 6 from multinational cooperative studies. Scores for the six domains of the AGREE II tool (scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigour of development, clarity of presentation, applicability and editorial independence) were 98.57%, 53.57%, 17.92%, 69.62%, 26.96% and 50.35%, respectively. Recommendations for nosocomial infection and control, human resource management as well as management of paediatric patients and their families were summarised. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the quality of rapid guidelines and consensuses for the management in paediatric wards affected by COVID-19 is unsatisfactory. In the future, it will be necessary to develop more high-quality guidelines or consensuses for the management in paediatric wards to deal with nosocomial outbreaks in order to fully prepare for emergency medical and health problems.","Luo, Wen-Yi; Sun, Ji-Wen; Zhang, Wen-Lan; Li, Qian; Ni, Ping; Zhao, Lie-Bin; Tian, Jin-Hui; Zhang, Ya-Qing; Lu, Hong",BMJ Open,,311

However, due to limited production capacities and logistical challenges it will take months/years until herd immunity is achieved. Therefore, vaccination and social distancing have to be coordinated. In this paper, we provide some insight on this topic using optimization-based control on an age-differentiated compartmental model. For real-life decision-making, we investigate the impact of the planning horizon on the optimal vaccination/social distancing strategy. We find that in order to reduce social distancing in the long run, without overburdening the health care system, it is essential to vaccinate the people with the highest contact rates first. That is also the case if the objective is to minimize fatalities provided that the social distancing measures are sufficiently strict. However, for short-term planning it is optimal to focus on the high-risk group. © 2021 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics","Grundel, S. M.; Heyder, S.; Hotz, T.; Ritschel, T. K.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the radiographs and clinical notes of all patients with DRFs managed nonoperatively, following the publication of the BOAST COVID-19 guidelines on the management of urgent trauma between 26 March and 18 May 2020. Radiological parameters including radial height, radial inclination, intra-articular step-off, and volar tilt from post-reduction or post-application of cast radiographs were measured. The assumption was that if one radiological parameter exceeds the acceptable criteria, the patient would have been considered for an operative intervention in pre-COVID times. Results: Overall, 92 patients formed the cohort of this study with a mean age of 66 years (21 to 96); 84% (n = 77) were female and 16% (n = 15) were male. In total, 54% (n = 50) of patients met at least one radiological indication for operative intervention with a mean age of 68 years (21 to 96). Of these, 42% (n = 21) were aged < 65 years and 58% (29) were aged &#8805; 65 years. Conclusion: More than half of all DRFs managed nonoperatively during the COVID-19 pandemic had at least one radiological indication to be considered for operative management pre-COVID. We anticipate a proportion of these cases will require corrective surgery in the future, which increases the load on corrective upper limb elective services. This should be accounted for when planning an exit strategy and the restart of elective surgery services.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-10:612-616.","Baawa-Ameyaw, Joanna; Kabariti, Rakan; Chandra, Arjun; Rhee, Jae",Bone Jt Open,,311

234835,Heart failure and COVID-19,2020,"Background: Segmentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lesions is a difficult task due to high uncertainty in the shape, size and location of the lesions. CT scan image is an important means of diagnosing COVID-19, but it requires doctors to observe a large number of scan images repeatedly to determine the patient’s condition. Moreover, the low contrast of CT scan and the presence of tissues such as blood vessels in the background increase the difficulty of diagnosis. To solve this problem, we proposed an improved segmentation model called the residual attention U-shaped network (ResAU-Net). Methods: A novel method to detect and segment coronavirus pneumonia was established based on the deep-learning algorithm. Firstly, the CT scan image was input, and lung segmentation was then realized by U-net. Then, the region of interest was selected by the minimum circumscribed rectangle clipping method. Finally, the proposed ResAU-Net, which includes attention module (AMB), residual module (RBM) and sub-pixel convolution module (SPCBM), was used to segment the infected area and generate the segmentation results. Results: We evaluated our model using cross-validation on 100 chest CT scans test images. The experimental results showed that our method achieved start-of-the-art performance on the pneumonia dataset. The mIoU and Dice cofficients of Lesion segmentation were 73.40%±2.24% and 84.5%±2.46%, and realize fast real-time processing. Conclusions: Our model can effectively solve the problems of poor segmentation accuracy in the segmentation of COVID-19 lesions, and the segmentation result image can effectively assist medical staff in the diagnosis and quantitative analysis of infection degree, and improve the screening and diagnosis efficiency of pneumonia.","Zhang, Z.; Ni, X.; Huo, G.; Li, Q.; Qi, F.",Annals of Translational Medicine,,311

236119,Recurrence of Upper Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis Secondary to COVID-19,2021,"The ongoing global novel coronavirus pneumonia COVID-19 outbreak has engendered numerous cases of infection and death. COVID-19 diagnosis relies upon nucleic acid detection; however, currently recommended methods exhibit high false-negative rates and are unable to identify other respiratory virus infections, thereby resulting in patient misdiagnosis and impeding epidemic containment. Combining the advantages of targeted amplification and long-read, real-time nanopore sequencing, herein, nanopore targeted sequencing (NTS) is developed to detect SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses simultaneously within 6-10 h, with a limit of detection of ten standard plasmid copies per reaction. Compared with its specificity for five common respiratory viruses, the specificity of NTS for SARS-CoV-2 reaches 100%. Parallel testing with approved real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction kits for SARS-CoV-2 and NTS using 61 nucleic acid samples from suspected COVID-19 cases show that NTS identifies more infected patients (22/61) as positive, while also effectively monitoring for mutated nucleic acid sequences, categorizing types of SARS-CoV-2, and detecting other respiratory viruses in the test sample. NTS is thus suitable for COVID-19 diagnosis; moreover, this platform can be further extended for diagnosing other viruses and pathogens.","Wang, Ming; Fu, Aisi; Hu, Ben; Tong, Yongqing; Liu, Ran; Liu, Zhen; Gu, Jiashuang; Xiang, Bin; Liu, Jianghao; Jiang, Wen; Shen, Gaigai; Zhao, Wanxu; Men, Dong; Deng, Zixin; Yu, Lilei; Wei, Wu; Li, Yan; Liu, Tiangang",Small,,311

These are emergencies and should be treated ASAP. Conducting emergency surgeries during pandemic like COVID-19 is challenge for surgeons and the entire hospital infrastructure. The available information about COVID-19 and its propensity of contamination through droplets and aerosol need some modifications for conducting surgeries successfully without contaminating the hospital buildings, protecting healthcare teams and the patient. With these objectives, some modifications in the operating theater including surgical techniques for minimal access, laparoscopy, and robotic surgery are proposed in this review article. This review article also discusses the safety measures to be followed for the suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient and the guidelines and recommendations for healthcare teams while treating these patients. Although there is little evidence of viral transmission through laparoscopic or open approaches, modifications to surgical practice such as the use of safe smoke evacuation and minimizing energy device used to reduce the risk of exposure to aerosolized particles to healthcare team are proposed in this review article.","Somashekhar, S P; Acharya, Rudra; Saklani, Avinash; Parikh, Devendra; Goud, Jagdishwar; Dixit, Jagannath; Gopinath, K; Kumar, M Vijay; Bhojwani, Rajesh; Nayak, Sandeep; Rao, Subramaneswar; Kothari, Kiran; Chandramohan, K; Desai, Sharad; Gupta, Arnab",Indian J Surg Oncol,,311

Previous studies focused on the influence of air pollutants and probable meteorological parameters on confirmed COVID-19 infections via epidemiological methods, whereas the findings of relations between possible variables and COVID-19 incidences using geographical perspective were scarce. In the present study, data concerning confirmed COVID-19 cases and possible affecting factors were collected for 325 cities across China up to May 27, 2020. The geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was introduced to explore the impact of probable determinants on confirmed COVID-19 incidences. Some results were obtained. AQI, PM2.5, and PM10 demonstrated significantly positive impacts on COVID-19 during the most study period with the majority lag group (P< 0.05). Nevertheless, the relation of temperature with COVID-19 was significantly negative (P< 0.05). Especially, CO exhibited a negative effect on COVID-19 in most study period with the majority lag group. The impacts of each possible determinant on COVID-19 represented significantly spatial heterogeneity. The obvious influence of the majority of possible factors on COVID-19 was mainly detected during the after lockdown period with the lag 21 group. Although the COVID-19 spreading has been effectively controlled by tough measures taken by the Chinese government, the study findings remind us to address the air pollution issues persistently for protecting human health.","Pei, Lin; Wang, Xiaoxia; Guo, Bin; Guo, Hongjun; Yu, Yan",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

Anxiety was studied with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item in hospital workforces and with the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) in online survey participants. Depression symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 in hospital employees and the HADS in the online survey sample. Symptoms were classified as absent/minimal, borderline abnormal or indicating clinical caseness. Staff reaction to COVID-19 was tapped with a 9-item-questionnaire and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-revised (IES-R).

Long-held assumptions about laboratory management have been reconsidered in light of these new circumstances. METHODS: Experience during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic at a clinical reference laboratory was reviewed in the context of several commonly held management principles to assess their relevance to clinical laboratory operations during a crisis. RESULTS: Management and operational ideas regarding different modes of communication, physical proximity and interaction, operating under a fixed budget, and maintaining a breadth of laboratory service offerings have been challenged during the COVID-19 pandemic. The importance of putting people first, maintaining collaboration, and providing effective leadership and communication throughout an organization have been highlighted. CONCLUSIONS: The collaborative activities of highly interdependent teams and individuals have helped the clinical laboratory community respond to society's needs in the COVID-19 crisis. Not all laboratory management principles apply equally well in the course of an international respiratory pandemic. When navigating crises, leaders need to distinguish situational management principles from those that are universal.","Jackson, Brian R; Genzen, Jonathan R",Am. j. clin. pathol,,311

Further we take account of the combination of contact patterns in two phases, making use of mass-action and ratio-dependent types for the infection force. We investigate the dependence of the basic reproduction number on the commuter ratio and the daily expected duration at the social phase as essential factors characterizing the community structure, and show that the dependence is significantly affected by the combination of contact patterns, and that the difference in the commuter ratio could make the risk of the spread of a transmissible disease significantly different.","Seno, Hiromi",J Math Biol,,311

The patient's clinical status rapidly improved, and biological records showed convincing results of decrease in interleukin-6 and inflammatory parameters under treatment. This case presents a proof-of-concept for the use of therapeutic plasma exchange with 5% albumin as sole replacement solution in a critically ill Covid-19 patient with cytokine release syndrome.

Further research is needed to determine optimal timing and thresholds for troponin and natriuretic peptides in anthracycline-treated patients and evaluate these and other promising biomarkers for anti-HER2 therapies, thoracic radiation, anti-VEGF therapy, and fluoropyrimidine therapy-related cardiotoxicity.

Numerous nations have therefore rolled out interventions to provide services to remove the determinants of vulnerability, such as limited education, early marriage, poverty, domestic violence, and exposure by male partners. Within this context, subpopulations such as sex workers increase the vulnerability amongst AGYW and are also supported through prevention programming. This study follows a project to develop a generic health information systems solution to provide a means to monitor and evaluate the successes of the AGYW initiative in reducing new infections. It borrows theoretical ideas from Henri Lefebvre's theory of moments to describe the process in which the space for the development of the solution is produced.","Matavire, Rangarirai; Braa, Jorn; Huwa, Shorai; Munangaidzwa, Lameck; Saugene, Zeferino; Taramusi, Isaac; Jolliffe, Bob",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09811v1.pdf,311

Cytokine storm syndromes of viral origin seem to have a common pathogenesis of the imbalanced immune response with the exaggerated inflammatory reaction combined with the reduction and functional exhaustion of T cells. Immunomodulatory therapy is gaining interest in COVID-19, but this strategy has received less attention in other respiratory viral infections than it deserved. In this review we suggest that based on the similarities of the immune dysfunction in the severe cases of different respiratory viral infections, some lessons from the immunomodulatory therapy of COVID-19 (particularly regarding the choice of an immunomodulatory drug, the selection of patients and optimal time window for this kind of therapy) could be applied for some cases of severe influenza infection and probably for some future outbreaks of novel severe respiratory viral infections.","Ryabkova, Varvara A; Churilov, Leonid P; Shoenfeld, Yehuda",Clin Immunol,,311

In an effort to contain the spread of the disease and treat the infected, researchers are racing against several odds to find an effective solution. The unavailability of timely and affordable or definitive treatment has caused significant morbidity and mortality. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by an unregulated host inflammatory response toward the viral infection, followed by multi-organ dysfunction or failure, is one of the primary causes of death in severe cases of COVID-19 infection. Currently, empirical management of respiratory and hematological manifestations along with anti-viral agents is being used to treat the infection. The quest is on for both a vaccine and a more definitive management protocol to curtail the spread. Researchers and clinicians are also exploring the possibility of using cell therapy for severe cases of COVID-19 with ARDS. Mesenchymal stromal cells are known to have immunomodulatory properties and have previously been used to treat viral infections. This review explores the potential of mesenchymal stromal cells as cell therapy for ARDS.","Shetty, Rohit; Murugeswari, Ponnalagu; Chakrabarty, Koushik; Jayadev, Chaitra; Matalia, Himanshu; Ghosh, Arkasubhra; Das, Debashish",Cytotherapy,,311

Using sentiment feature analysis and topic modeling, we reveal substantial differences between the use of the controversial terms such as""Chinese virus""and that of the non-controversial terms such as""COVID-19"". For example, tweets using controversial terms contain a higher percentage of anger as well as negative emotions. They also point to China more frequently. Our results suggest that while the term""Chinese virus""could be interpreted either as neutral or racist, its usage on social media leans strongly towards the latter.","Chen, Long; Lyu, Hanjia; Yang, Tongyu; Wang, Yu; Luo, Jiebo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10225v1.pdf,311

Without a vaccine, behavior change is the most effective means of reducing disease transmission. Identifying psychological factors that may encourage engagement in preventative health behaviors is crucial. The behavioral immune system (BIS) represents a set of psychological processes thought to promote health by encouraging disease avoidance behaviors. This study examined whether individual differences in BIS reactivity (germ aversion, pathogen disgust sensitivity) were associated with concern about COVID-19 and engagement in recommended preventative health behaviors (social distancing, handwashing, cleaning/disinfecting, avoiding touching face, wearing facemasks). From March 20 to 23, 2020, a US national sample (N = 1019) completed an online survey. Germ aversion and pathogen disgust sensitivity were the two variables most consistently associated with COVID-19 concern and preventative health behaviors, while accounting for demographic, health, and psychosocial covariates.

To date, quantifying seasonality of the disease has been limited by scarce data and the difficulty of isolating climatological variables from other drivers of transmission in observational studies. We combine a spatially resolved dataset of confirmed COVID-19 cases, composed of 3,235 regions across 173 countries, with local environmental conditions and a statistical approach developed to quantify causal effects of environmental conditions in observational data settings. We find that ultraviolet (UV) radiation has a statistically significant effect on daily COVID-19 growth rates: a SD increase in UV lowers the daily growth rate of COVID-19 cases by â¼1 percentage point over the subsequent 2.5 wk, relative to an average in-sample growth rate of 13.2%. The time pattern of lagged effects peaks 9 to 11 d after UV exposure, consistent with the combined timescale of incubation, testing, and reporting. Cumulative effects of temperature and humidity are not statistically significant. Simulations illustrate how seasonal changes in UV have influenced regional patterns of COVID-19 growth rates from January to June, indicating that UV has a substantially smaller effect on the spread of the disease than social distancing policies. Furthermore, total COVID-19 seasonality has indeterminate sign for most regions during this period due to uncertain effects of other environmental variables. Our findings indicate UV exposure influences COVID-19 cases, but a comprehensive understanding of seasonality awaits further analysis.","Carleton, Tamma; Cornetet, Jules; Huybers, Peter; Meng, Kyle C; Proctor, Jonathan",Proc.

Nurses who were actively and daily involved in the care of COVID-19 patients on selected intensive care units (ICU) and non-ICU wards were included. Depression, somatization, anxiety and distress scores were calculated using the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ). The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and Brief-COPE questionnaires were used to assess respectively the psychological impact and coping strategies. Participants were asked to fill in the questionnaire at the start of inclusion, 4 weeks later and 8 weeks later.Results: In total, 39/42 included nurses participated in the study. 4DSQ results showed low rates of depression, anxiety and somatization with a declining trend over time. Distress scores however were high throughout the study period. A past history of stress symptoms was significantly associated with higher distress scores at the inclusion and one month follow-up. As major psychological impact, more participants experienced 'intrusion' compared to 'avoidance' specifically among nurses working on ICU. In 10% of participants, IES-R-scores were predictive for post-traumatic stress disorder.Conclusion: Healthcare workers dealing with COVID-19 patients during the pandemic reported high and enduring distress scores and experienced a major impact on mental health, especially when employed at ICU.

The present study examined the development and evaluation of care pathways to manage nutritional care of patients following COVID-19 infection prior to and after discharge. METHODS: Registered UK dietitians completed an online questionnaire comprising 26 questions about the development of a pathway, its use, evaluation and training needs. RESULTS: Of 57 responses from organisations, 37 (65%) were involved in the planning/management of nutritional care. Only 19 responses had a new or adapted COVID-19 pathway. Of these, 74% reported involvement of dietetic services, 47% reported > 1 eligibility criteria for pathway inclusion and 53% accepted all positive or suspected cases. All respondents used nutritional screening, first-line dietary advice (food first) and referral for further advice and monitoring. Weight and food intake were the most used outcome measure. All pathways addressed symptoms related to nutrition, with the most common being weight loss with poor appetite, not being hungry and skipping meals in 84% of pathways. Over half of respondents (54%) planned to evaluate their pathway and 83% reported that they were 'very or reasonably confident' in their team's nutritional management of COVID-19. Less than half (42%) reported on training needs. CONCLUSIONS: Despite challenges encountered, pathways were developed and implemented. Dietitians had adapted to new ways of working to manage nutritional care in patients prior to and after discharge from hospital following COVID-19 infection.

Diagnóstico y Tratamiento de personas afectadas por COVID-19 en el Perú¼;donde se establecen una serie de criterios técnicos y procedimientos para la atención de personas afectadas con COVID-19 (Sociedad Peruana de Medicina Interna (SPMI) 2020) En tal sentido, resulta importante actualizar y revisar la evidencia disponible del uso de la cloroquina o hidroxicloroquina en el tratamiento de pacientes con COVID-19, sea como tratamiento en cualquier contexto clínico de la enfermedad o como profilaxis METODOS: Se realizó la actualización del presente reporte breve, mediante una búsqueda de bibliografía de revisiones sistemáticas (RS), ensayos clínicos aleatorizados (ECA) y estudios observacionales en PubMed (https://www ncbi nlm nih gov/pubmed/) Se consideró extraer información con una estrategia de «bola de nieve¼ mediante la revisión de listas de referencias de las revisiones sistemáticas (RS), estudios primarios y revisiones narrativas seleccionadas que sean de relevancia Asimismo, se realizó una búsqueda manual en las páginas web de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (https://www who int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019), Organización Panamericana de Salud

(SPMI) 2020) CONCLUSIÓN: A la fecha, no se dispone de resultados de ECAs o estudios observacionales publicados en revistas científicas sobre la eficacia/efectividad y seguridad de cloroquina o hidroxicloroquina para el tratamiento o profilaxis de la COVID-19 La publicación preliminar en el repositorio de pre-impresiones de publicaciones científicas medRxiv, de un ECA de etiqueta abierta que usó hidroxicloroquina en pacientes hospitalizados con COVID-19, no encontró diferencias en la respuesta virológica (desenlace principal del estudio);sin embargo, se presentó una mayor frecuencia de eventos adversos en pacientes que recibieron hidroxicloroquina Este estudio debe tomarse con cautela por el riesgo de sesgos de todo estudio de etiqueta abierta, y esperar a que se determine si sus resultados son válidos y clínicamente relevantes luego de ser sometidos a revisión por pares en una revista científica Respecto al tratamiento profiláctico con cloroquina o hidroxicloroquina contra COVID-19, una RS publicada por Shah et al , no identificó algún ensayo clínico que evalúe el uso profiláctico de estos medicamentos contra COVID-19 y considera que la alta de estudios no permite respaldar la eficacia clínica de cloroquina o hidroxicloroquina en la prevención de COVID-19 La Autoridad Nacional en Salud y algunas sociedades médicas peruanas, precisando la falta de evidencia que demuestre la eficacia de algún tratamiento para la COVID-19, han propuesto el uso de cloroquina y hidroxicloroquina como medida terapéutica en COVID19, bajo decisión del médico tratante y luego de informar a su paciente acerca del riesgobeneficio, expresando que se requiere de supervisión médica ante los posibles eventos adversos e interacción con otras drogas durante el tratamiento Estas mismas consideraciones deben ser seguidas y quedan bajo responsabilidad del médico tratante cuando se propone su uso como profilaxis de la enfermedad, según lo establecido en el Documento Técnico del Ministerio de Salud del Perú Así, con la evidencia científica al momento disponible, el IETSI considera que no es posible llegar a conclusiones que permitan brindar recomendaciones a favor del uso de cloroquina o hidroxicloroquina como tratamiento o profilaxis de COVID-29 La comunidad científica médica sigue a la espera de la publicación de resultados de los ECAs fase III que vienen realizándose en varios países del mundo (Ej ECA SOLIDARITY), que permitan determinar la utilidad y en caso de demostrarse eficacia o efectividad, establecer recomendaciones basadas en evidencia del uso de cloroquina e hidroxicloroquina Siendo que a la fecha aún mantienen su preocupación por el riesgo de eventos adversos que estos medicamentos significan frente a una eficacia aun no acreditada, considerando además que la publicación preliminar del ECA de Tang et al , encontró una mayor frecuencia de eventos adversos y que el estudio clínico de fase IIb de Borba encontró una mayor frecuencia de eventos adversos cardiológicos con el uso de cloroquina 600 mg dos veces al día durante 10 días comparado con dosis menores Por lo tanto, con la limitada evidencia disponible a la fecha (16 de abril 2020), se mantiene la conclusión de las versiones previas de este documento","Peru.

METHODS: In this retrospective observational evaluation we combined SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and antigen test reports from the Washington Disease Reporting System with community case investigation and contact tracing data for 3 health districts (comprising 5 counties) in central Washington State. All 3 health districts have large Hispanic communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. RESULTS: Investigators attempted to call all referred individuals with COVID-19 (n = 4,987); 71% were interviewed. Of those asked about close contacts (n = 3,572), 68% reported having no close contacts, with similar proportions across ethnicity, sex, and age group. The 968 individuals with COVID-19 who named specific contacts (27% of those asked) reported a total of 2,293 contacts (mean of 2.4 contacts per individual with COVID-19); 85% of listed contacts participated in an interview. CONCLUSIONS: Most individuals with COVID-19 reported having no close contacts. Increasing community engagement and public messaging, as well as understanding and addressing barriers to participation, are crucial for CICT to contribute meaningfully to controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Miller, James S; Bonacci, Robert A; Lash, R Ryan; Moonan, Patrick K; Houck, Peter; Van Meter, J Joyous; Butler, Malcolm; Everson, Teresa; Morrison, Brittany; Sixberry, Melissa; Person, Amy; Oeltmann, John E",J. community health,,311
262117,"Acute cardiac injury is associated with adverse outcomes, including mortality in COVID-19 patients. A single-center experience",2020,"The newly evolved coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which has precipitated a global COVID-19 pandemic among the human population, has been shown to be associated with disease in captive wild animals. Bats (Chiroptera) have been shown to be susceptible to experimental infection and therefore may be at risk from disease when in contact with infected people. Numerous conservation fieldwork activities are undertaken across the United Kingdom bringing potentially infected people into close proximity with bats. In this study, we analysed the risks of disease from SARS-CoV-2 to free-living bat species in England through fieldworkers undertaking conservation activities and ecological survey work, using a qualitative, transparent method devised for assessing threats of disease to free-living wild animals. The probability of exposure of bats to SARS-CoV-2 through fieldwork activities was estimated to range from negligible to high, depending on the proximity between bats and people during the activity. The likelihood of infection after exposure was estimated to be high and the probability of dissemination of the virus through bat populations medium. The likelihood of clinical disease occurring in infected bats was low, and therefore, the ecological, economic and environmental consequences were predicted to be low. The overall risk estimation was low, and therefore, mitigation measures are advisable. There is uncertainty in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in bats and therefore in the risk estimation. Disease risk management measures are suggested, including the use of personal protective equipment, good hand hygiene and following the existing government advice. The disease risk analysis should be updated as information on the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses in bats improves. The re-analysis may be informed by health surveillance of free-living bats.","Common, Sophie M; Shadbolt, Tammy; Walsh, Katherine; Sainsbury, Anthony W",Transbound. emerg. dis. (Internet),,311

264256,Prognostic utility of quantitative offline 2D-echocardiography in hospitalized patients with COVID-19,2021,"Social workers are familiar with the challenges brought on by the coronavirus pandemic; and we apply three gerontological social work perspectives that might increase our chances of minimizing negative outcomes and improving health and quality of life for everyone. First, the reality that the older population is very heterogeneous challenges ageism and age-stereotyping that has surfaced with COVID-19. Second, concepts of cumulative disadvantage and intersectionality offer clear explanations of the disparities that are being illuminated and lead us to advocate for fundamental changes to reduce disparities in later life and for people across the life course. Third, a strength-based perspective highlights the assets of the older population and the opportunities for positive developments coming out of the crisis. We can capitalize on momentum to increase advance care planning, to reduce social isolation, and expand the use of on-line technology for service provision. We can bolster our arguments to support older workers, volunteers, and caregivers. The fact that these social work perspectives are so applicable to the coronavirus situation reminds us of their fundamental relevance. Gerontological social work has much to offer in our roles as researchers, educators, practitioners, and advocates during this crisis, and our foundational principles serve us well.","Swinford, Emma; Galucia, Natalie; Morrow-Howell, Nancy",J Gerontol Soc Work,,311

The current literature demonstrates unclear outcomes regarding barotrauma in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence of barotrauma in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and its influence on survival. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed from March 18, 2020 to May 5, 2020, with follow-up through June 18, 2020, encompassing critically ill intubated patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia at an academic tertiary care hospital in Brooklyn, New York. Critically ill patients with pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, or both (n = 75) were compared to those without evidence of barotrauma (n = 206). Clinical characteristics and short-term patient outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Barotrauma occurred in 75/281 (26.7%) of included patients. On multivariable analysis, factors associated with increased 30-day mortality were elevated age (HR 1.015 [95% CI 1.004-1.027], P = 0.006), barotrauma (1.417 [1.040-1.931], P = 0.027), and renal dysfunction (1.602 [1.055-2.432], P = 0.027). Protective factors were administration of remdesivir (0.479 [0.321-0.714], P < 0.001) and receipt of steroids (0.488 [0.370-0.643], P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Barotrauma occurred at high rates in intubated critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and was found to be an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality.","Gazivoda, Victor P; Ibrahim, Mudathir; Kangas-Dick, Aaron; Sun, Arony; Silver, Michael; Wiesel, Ory",J Intensive Care Med,,311

265936,Case Report: Barotrauma in COVID-19 Case Series,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Investigate the effect of a targeted wellness program on burnout in Otolaryngology residents. METHODS: Residents and faculty collaboratively developed a program aimed at improving resident wellness. Program implementation began in July of 2018 and after 1 year, residents evaluated the program's effects on burnout. We used the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and a Likert scale to evaluate the effects of the program. RESULTS: After 1 year of the resident wellness program, the MBI results showed an increase in the number of residents in the ""engaged"" category and a decrease in those rated as ""burnout."" Residents rated favorably initiatives grouped into the following themes: time away from work, faculty engaging with residents outside of the hospital environment, efforts to enhance residents' self-efficacy, fostering a positive culture among residents, and providing easy access to physical activity. The majority of initiatives were targeted to the ""culture of wellness"" domain, as defined by the Stanford Well MD framework. Our program targeted to a lesser extent the other 2 domains, ""efficiency of practice"" and ""personal resilience."" CONCLUSION: After 1 year, the wellness program resulted in a trend toward improving burnout. Future efforts should be focused on targeting the multidimensional drivers of burnout as defined by established wellness frameworks. Realizing new stressors brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic will also be an area of active effort and research.","Acevedo, Joseph R; Schlacter, Jamie A; Chambers, Tamara N; Jacobson, Lia K; Yalamanchili, Ronica; Clark, Bhavishya; Pan, Dorothy; Kokot, Niels C; Johns, Michael M",Ear Nose Throat J,,311

270178,The effect of hepatic steatosis on COVID-19 severity: Chest computed tomography findings,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) can be a serious and debilitating adverse effect that is highly feared by cancer patients. For patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens at our institution in the ambulatory infusion center, palonosetron was selected as the preferred serotonin (5-HT3) antagonist for CINV prophylaxis per the 2016 NCCN Guidelines, when a neurokinin1 antagonist was not included in the prophylactic regimen. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of dexamethasone and palonosetron versus granisetron for the prevention of CINV in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens. METHODS: This study is an Institutional Review Board-approved, single-center retrospective review of electronic health records including patients who received moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens with CINV prophylaxis with dexamethasone and either palonosetron or granisetron. RESULTS: A total of 268 eligible patients were included in the study. Eighty-eight patients received palonosetron and 180 patients received granisetron as their 5-HT3 receptor antagonist between October 31, 2014 and October 31, 2016. There were no statistically significant differences between the two antiemetic groups for the primary outcome of presence of any change in day 1 intravenous prophylactic antiemetics. Nine (10.23%) palonosetron patients and 15 (8.33%) granisetron patients required a change in their day 1 intravenous prophylactic antiemetics (P = 0.610). CONCLUSIONS: Despite palonosetron's better efficacy, longer half-life, and higher binding affinity, the results of this retrospective review demonstrates that the choice of serotonin antagonist, palonosetron or granisetron, did not result in a change in day 1 intravenous prophylactic antiemetics or antiemetic outpatient medications for patients undergoing moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens.","Gamble, Melissa; Carroll, Elisabeth; Wright, Garth C; Glode, Ashley E",J Oncol Pharm Pract,,311

We discuss a 5-week-old male infant who presented atypically with severe COVID-19 infection. To our knowledge, he is the youngest reported case in the UK to require mechanical ventilation and intensive care treatment as a direct result of COVID-19 following horizontal transmission. This case has generated several learning points with regard to atypical presentations of COVID-19 and identifying a potential cohort of 'at risk' infants.

270862,Effect of Hydroxychloroquine on Clinical Status at 14 Days in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial,2020,"BACKGROUND: Relaxation of laws and regulations around privacy and billing during the COVID-19 pandemic provide expanded opportunities to use telehealth to provide patient care at a distance. Many health systems have transitioned to providing outpatient care via telehealth; however, there is an opportunity to utilize telehealth for inpatients to promote physical distancing. OBJECTIVE: This article evaluates the use of a rapidly implemented, secure inpatient telehealth program. METHODS: We assembled a multidisciplinary team to rapidly design, implement, and iteratively improve an inpatient telehealth quality improvement initiative using an existing videoconferencing system at our academic medical center. We assigned each hospital bed space a unique meeting link and updated the meeting password for each new patient. Patients and families were encouraged to use their own mobile devices to join meetings when possible. RESULTS: Within 7 weeks of go-live, we hosted 1,820 inpatient telehealth sessions (13.3 sessions per 100 bedded days). We logged 104,647 minutes of inpatient telehealth time with a median session duration of 22 minutes (range 1-1,961). There were 5,288 participant devices used with a mean of 3 devices per telehealth session (range 2-22). Clinicians found they were able to build rapport and perform a reasonable physical exam. CONCLUSION: We successfully implemented and scaled a secure inpatient telehealth program using an existing videoconferencing system in less than 1 week. Our implementation provided an intuitive naming convention for providers and capitalized on the broad availability of smartphones and tablets. Initial comments from clinicians suggest the system was useful; however, further work is needed to streamline initial setup for patients and families as well as care coordination to support clinician communication and workflows. Numerous use cases identified suggest a role for inpatient telehealth will remain after the COVID-19 crisis underscoring the importance of lasting regulatory reform.","Hron, Jonathan D; Parsons, Chase R; Williams, Lee Ann; Harper, Marvin B; Bourgeois, Fabienne C",Appl Clin Inform,,311
271066,COVID-19 Fatigue: Not So Fast,2020,"Globally, there is an urgency to develop effective, low-cost therapeutic interventions for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We previously generated the stable and ultrapotent homotrimeric Pittsburgh inhalable Nanobody 21 (PiN-21). Using Syrian hamsters that model moderate to severe COVID-19 disease, we demonstrate the high efficacy of PiN-21 to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intranasal delivery of PiN-21 at 0.6 mg/kg protects infected animals from weight loss and substantially reduces viral burdens in both lower and upper airways compared to control. Aerosol delivery of PiN-21 facilitates deposition throughout the respiratory tract and dose minimization to 0.2 mg/kg. Inhalation treatment quickly reverses animals' weight loss after infection, decreases lung viral titers by 6 logs leading to drastically mitigated lung pathology, and prevents viral pneumonia.

Methods Data of the close contacts of COVID-19 in Xi'an was collected. We analyzed the distribution of close contacts in the population and isolation measures of close contacts and confirmed cases among different exposure conditions. Results By 0: 00 February 28, the cumulative number of confirmed cases and close contacts in Xi'an had been 120 and 5 241, respectively.Medical workers accounted for 7.92% of the close contacts. Across different age groups, the proportion of the youth group was the highest (56%). Indifferent areas of Xi'an, Yanta District had the largest number of close contacts(913) while Huyi District had the lowest number (29). The main contact route was contact within the family (1 875). The majority of the confirmed cases were infected within the family (35), followed by shopping places (26). Conclusion By 0: 00 February 28, close contacts of COVID-19 in Xi'an had mostly been found in Yanta District. The young constituted the main group, and close contacts within the family had a high risk of infection. In view of the above characteristics, it is necessary to improve the screening of people having close contact with COVID-19 in key areas and populations.","Zhang, Huihui; Ji, Zhenhao; Chen, Zhijun; Zeng, Lingxia; Mi, Baibing; Chen, Fangyao; Shen, Mingwang; Liu, Wenjun; Qi, Xin; Li, Chao; Pei, Leilei; Zhuang, Guihua",J.

272721,"An Open-Label Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety & Efficacy of Siddha Sastric Medicines - Fixed Regimen in CONID-19 Positive Asymptomatic, Mild or Moderate cases - A Pilot Study",2021,"OBJECTIVES: Treating acute respiratory failure in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 is challenging due to the lack of knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology. Hypoxemia may be explained in part by the loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. The present study assessed the effect of almitrine, a selective pulmonary vasoconstrictor, on arterial oxygenation in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome. DESIGN: Single-center retrospective observational study. SETTING: ICU of Lille Teaching Hospital, France, from February 27, 2020, to April 14, 2020. PATIENTS: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia confirmed by positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 and acute respiratory distress syndrome according to Berlin definition. Data focused on clinicobiological features, ventilator settings, therapeutics, outcomes, and almitrine-related adverse events. INTERVENTIONS: Almitrine was considered in patients with severe hypoxemia (PaO2/FIO2 ratio < 150 mm Hg) in addition to the recommended therapies, at an hourly IV delivery of 10 µg/kg/min. Comparative blood gases were done before starting almitrine trial and immediately after the end of the infusion. A positive response to almitrine was defined by an increase of PaO2/FIO2 ratio greater than or equal to 20% at the end of the infusion. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 169 patients were enrolled. Thirty-two patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome received an almitrine infusion trial. In most cases, almitrine was infused in combination with inhaled nitric oxide (75%). Twenty-one patients (66%) were responders. The median PaO2/FIO2 ratio improvement was 39% (9-93%) and differs significantly between the responders and nonresponders (67% [39-131%] vs 6% [9-16%], respectively; p < 0.0001). The 28-day mortality rates were 47.6% and 63.6% (p = 0.39) for the responders and nonresponders, respectively. Hemodynamic parameters remained similar before and after the trial, not suggesting acute cor pulmonale. CONCLUSIONS: Almitrine infusion improved oxygenation in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome without adverse effects. In a multistep clinical approach to manage severe hypoxemia in this population, almitrine could be an interesting therapeutic option to counteract the loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and redistribute blood flow away from shunting zones.","Caplan, Morgan; Goutay, Julien; Bignon, Anne; Jaillette, Emmanuelle; Favory, Raphael; Mathieu, Daniel; Parmentier-Decrucq, Erika; Poissy, Julien; Duburcq, Thibault",Crit. care med,,311

In our global society they can rage around the world with an immense toll in terms of human, economic and social impact. Forecasting the spreading of a pandemic is, therefore, paramount in helping governments to enforce a number of social and economic measures, apt at curbing the pandemic and dealing with its aftermath. We demonstrate that the epidemic renormalisation group approach to pandemics provides an effective and simple way to investigate the dynamics of disease transmission and spreading across different regions of the world. The framework also allows for reliable projections on the impact of travel limitations and social distancing measures on global epidemic spread. We test and calibrate it on reported COVID-19 cases while unveiling the mechanism that governs the delay in the relative peaks of newly infected cases among different regions of the globe. We discover that social distancing measures are more effective than travel limitations across borders in delaying the epidemic peak. We further provide the link to compartmental models such as the time-honoured SIR-like models. We also show how to generalise the framework to account for the interactions across several regions of the world, replacing or complementing large scale simulations.","Cacciapaglia, Giacomo; Sannino, Francesco",Sci Rep,,311

In this prospective monocentric study of patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) rescued by ECMO, we performed longitudinal measurements of coagulation and fibrinolysis markers throughout the course of ECMO support in 20 COVID-19 and 10 non-COVID-19 patients. Blood was sampled before and then 24 hours, 7, and 14 days after ECMO implantation. Clinical outcomes were prospectively assessed until discharge from the intensive care unit or death. The median age of participants was 47 (35-56) years, with a median body mass index of 30 (27-35) kg/m2, and a Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score of 12 (8-16). Baseline levels of von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, factor VIII, prothrombin F1 + 2, thrombin-antithrombin, D-dimer, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were elevated in both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS patients, indicating that endothelial activation, endogenous thrombin generation, and fibrinolysis shutdown occur in all ARDS patients before ECMO implantation. From baseline to day 7, thrombin generation (prothrombin F1 + 2, p < 0.01) and fibrin formation markers (fibrin monomers, p < 0.001) significantly increased, further resulting in significant decreases in platelet count (p < 0.0001) and fibrinogen level (p < 0.001). PAI-1 levels significantly decreased from baseline to day 7 (p < 0.0001) in all ARDS patients. These changes were more marked in COVID-19 patients, resulting in 14 nonfatal and 3 fatal bleeding. Additional studies are warranted to determine whether monitoring of thrombin generation and fibrinolysis markers might help to early predict bleeding complications in COVID-19 patients supported by ECMO.","Hékimian, Guillaume; Masi, Paul; Lejeune, Manon; Lebreton, Guillaume; Chommeloux, Juliette; Desnos, Cyrielle; Pineton De Chambrun, Marc; Martin-Toutain, Isabelle; Nieszkowska, Ania; Bréchot, Nicolas; Schmidt, Matthieu; Leprince, Pascal; Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Combes, Alain; Frere, Corinne",Thromb. haemost,,311
273970,"COVID-19 associated central nervous system manifestations, mental and neurological symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis",2021,"BACKGROUND: Collection of biospecimens is a critical first step to understanding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women and newborns - vulnerable populations that are challenging to enroll and at risk of exclusion from research. We describe the establishment of a COVID-19 perinatal biorepository, the unique challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and strategies used to overcome them. METHODS: A transdisciplinary approach was developed to maximize the enrollment of pregnant women and their newborns into a COVID-19 prospective cohort and tissue biorepository, established on March 19, 2020 at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The first SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant woman was enrolled on April 2, and enrollment was expanded to SARS-CoV-2 negative controls on April 20. A unified enrollment strategy with a single consent process for pregnant women and newborns was implemented on May 4. SARS-CoV-2 status was determined by viral detection on RT-PCR of a nasopharyngeal swab. Wide-ranging and pregnancy-specific samples were collected from maternal participants during pregnancy and postpartum. Newborn samples were collected during the initial hospitalization. RESULTS: Between April 2 and June 9, 100 women and 78 newborns were enrolled in the MGH COVID-19 biorepository. The rate of dyad enrollment and number of samples collected per woman significantly increased after changes to enrollment strategy (from 5 to over 8 dyads/week, P < 0.0001, and from 7 to 9 samples, P < 0.01). The number of samples collected per woman was higher in SARS-CoV-2 negative than positive women (9 vs 7 samples, P = 0.0007). The highest sample yield was for placenta (96%), umbilical cord blood (93%), urine (99%), and maternal blood (91%). The lowest-yield sample types were maternal stool (30%) and breastmilk (22%). Of the 61 delivered women who also enrolled their newborns, fewer women agreed to neonatal blood compared to cord blood (39 vs 58, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Establishing a COVID-19 perinatal biorepository required patient advocacy, transdisciplinary collaboration and creative solutions to unique challenges. This biorepository is unique in its comprehensive sample collection and the inclusion of a control population. It serves as an important resource for research into the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women and newborns and provides lessons for future biorepository efforts.","Shook, Lydia L; Shui, Jessica E; Boatin, Adeline A; Devane, Samantha; Croul, Natalie; Yonker, Lael M; Matute, Juan D; Lima, Rosiane S; Schwinn, Muriel; Cvrk, Dana; Gardner, Laurel; Azevedo, Robin; Stanton, Suzanne; Bordt, Evan A; Yockey, Laura J; Fasano, Alessio; Li, Jonathan Z; Yu, Xu G; Kaimal, Anjali J; Lerou, Paul H; Edlow, Andrea G",BMC Med Res Methodol,,311

Particularly in patients with cancer, these changes can exacerbate the pre-existing psychological stress associated with cancer diagnosis and treatment. We performed a narrative review, encompassing changes to cancer care as a result of COVID-19, the psychological effects of treatment delays, and strategies to mitigate these effects. A number of review articles and guideline bodies have provided guidance on patients for whom treatment may be safely delayed, including low-risk bladder, prostate and kidney tumors, as well as intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer. Mental health diagnoses are prevalent in patients with genitourinary malignancies. Evidence regarding psychologic effects of deferred treatment is limited to those with low risk of disease related morbidity. In this population, psychologic distress attenuated with time. However, in the COVID-19 context, patients with advanced disease are particularly prone to psychologic distress, as are women and younger patients. Strategies to mitigate this distress are emerging and center on recognition from the treating oncologist with appropriate referral as necessary to psycho-oncology providers and engagement of peer-supports. The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped social structures and health care delivery. For patients with genitourinary malignancies, this may be associated with significant distress, particularly among those with advanced disease and those undergoing active treatment. Physicians treating these patients need to be aware of the psychologic stress the combined effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, cancer diagnosis, and cancer treatment can have and make appropriate referrals to support the holistic care of their patients.","Klaassen, Zachary; Wallis, Christopher J D",Urol. oncol,,311

Such parameters are typically estimated by measuring various characteristics (such as the number of infected and recovered individuals) of the infected populations over time. However, these measurements also incur certain costs, depending on the population being tested and the times at which the tests are administered. We thus formulate the epidemic parameter estimation problem as an optimization problem, where the goal is to either minimize the total cost spent on collecting measurements, or to optimize the parameter estimates while remaining within a measurement budget. We show that these problems are NP-hard to solve in general, and then propose approximation algorithms with performance guarantees. We validate our algorithms using numerical examples.","Ye, Lintao; Par'e, Philip E.; Sundaram, Shreyas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04750v1.pdf,311

The analyses were performed in a sample of 105 women who had dropped charges. Then, we ran Binary Logistic Regression analyses to predict the risk of withdrawal during the initial stages of proceedings. RESULTS: Women withdrawing in the initial stages showed more indicators that the ending of the relationship was still incipient.

The pandemic may increase the rate of intercurrent events (ICEs) and missing values, spurring a great deal of discussion on amending protocols and statistical analysis plans to address these issues. In this article, we revisit recent research on estimands and handling of missing values, especially the ICH E9 (R1) Addendum on Estimands and Sensitivity Analysis in Clinical Trials. Based on an in-depth discussion of the strategies for handling ICEs using a causal inference framework, we suggest some improvements in applying the estimand and estimation framework in ICH E9 (R1). Specifically, we discuss a mix of strategies allowing us to handle ICEs differentially based on reasons for ICEs. We also suggest ICEs should be handled primarily by hypothetical strategies and provide examples of different hypothetical strategies for different types of ICEs as well as a road map for estimation and sensitivity analyses. We conclude that the proposed framework helps streamline translating clinical objectives into targets of statistical inference and automatically resolves many issues with defining estimands and choosing estimation procedures arising from events such as the pandemic.","Qu, Yongming; Lipkovich, Ilya",Ther. innov. regul. sci.

We use SafeGraph smart device location data and variation in the date that US states and counties issued face mask mandates as a set of natural experiments to investigate risk compensation behavior. We compare time at home and the number of visits to public locations before and after face mask orders conditional on multiple statistical controls. We find that face mask orders lead to risk compensation behavior. Americans subject to the mask orders spend 11-24 fewer minutes at home on average and increase visits to some commercial locations-most notably restaurants, which are a high-risk location. It is unclear if this would lead to a net increase or decrease in transmission. However, it is clear that mask orders would be an important part of an economic recovery if people otherwise overestimate the risk of visiting public places.","Yan, Youpei; Bayham, Jude; Richter, Aaron; Fenichel, Eli P",Sci Rep,,311

Recent experience with developing and testing viral vaccine candidates can inform expectations regarding the development of safe and effective vaccines. OBJECTIVE: To estimate timelines and probabilities of success for recent vaccine candidates. DESIGN: ClinicalTrials.gov was searched to identify trials testing viral vaccines that had not advanced to phase 2 before 2005, and the progress of each vaccine from phase 1 through to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure was tracked. Trial characteristics were double-coded. (Registration: Open Science Framework [https://osf.io/dmuzx/]). SETTING: Trials launched between January 2005 and March 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Preventive viral vaccine candidates for 23 emerging or reemerged viral infectious diseases. MEASUREMENTS: The primary end point was the probability of vaccines advancing from launch of phase 2 to FDA licensure within 10 years. RESULTS: In total, 606 clinical trials forming 220 distinct development trajectories (267 343 enrolled participants) were identified. The probability of vaccines progressing from phase 2 to licensure within 10 years was 10.0% (95% CI, 2.6% to 16.9%), with most approvals representing H1N1 or H5N1 vaccines. The average timeline from phase 2 to approval was 4.4 years (range, 6.4 weeks to 13.9 years). The probabilities of advancing from phase 1 to 2, phase 2 to 3, and phase 3 to licensure within the total available follow-up time were 38.2% (CI, 30.7% to 45.0%), 38.3% (CI, 23.1% to 50.5%), and 61.1% (CI, 3.7% to 84.3%), respectively. LIMITATIONS: The study did not account for preclinical development and relied primarily on ClinicalTrials.gov and FDA resources. Success probabilities do not capture the varied reasons why vaccines fail to advance to regulatory approval. CONCLUSION: Success probabilities and timelines varied widely across different vaccine types and diseases. If a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is licensed within 18 months of the start of the pandemic, it will mark an unprecedented achievement for noninfluenza viral vaccine development.

METHODS: Data pertaining to patients who required ECMO support between 2018 and 2019 were reviewed. ECMO staffing costs were estimated based on national trends and modelled by annual utilization and case volume. A break-even point was derived from a comparison between nurse specialist-led and perfusionist-led models. For each scenario, direct medical costs were calculated based on utilization which was in turn defined by ""low"" (4 days), ""average"" (10 days), and ""high"" (30 days) duration of time spent on ECMO. RESULTS: Within the time frame, there was a total of 107 ECMO cases with a mean ECMO duration of 11 days, within the study time frame. Overall, ECMO nursing personnel costs were less than those for perfusionists ($108,000 vs $175,000). Programmatic costs were higher in the perfusionist-led versus nurse specialist-led model when annual utilization was greater than 10 cases and ECMO duration was longer than a mean of 9.7 days. There was no difference in survival between the two models. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a perfusionist-led ECMO model may be more cost-conscious in the context of low utilization, smaller case volume and shorter ECMO duration. However, once annual case volume exceeds 10 and mean ECMO duration exceeds 10 days, the nurse specialist-led model may be more cost-conscious.","Dhamija, Ankit; Kakuturu, Jahnavi; Schauble, Drew; Hayanga, Heather K; Jacobs, Jeffrey P; Badhwar, Vinay; Hayanga, J W Awori",Ann. thorac. surg,,311
288770,Coronavirus disease pandemic (Covid-19): Challenges and a global perspective,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a digital surveillance model using Google Trends is feasible for obtaining accurate data on coronavirus disease 2019 and whether accurate predictions can be made regarding new cases. METHODS: Data on total and daily new cases in each US state were collected from January 22, 2020, to April 6, 2020. Information regarding 10 keywords was collected from Google Trends, and correlation analyses were performed for individual states as well as for the United States overall. RESULTS: Among the 10 keywords analyzed from Google Trends, face mask, Lysol, and COVID stimulus check had the strongest correlations when looking at the United States as a whole, with R values of 0.88, 0.82, and 0.79, respectively. Lag and lead Pearson correlations were assessed for every state and all 10 keywords from 16 days before the first case in each state to 16 days after the first case. Strong correlations were seen up to 16 days prior to the first reported cases in some states. CONCLUSION: This study documents the feasibility of syndromic surveillance of internet search terms to monitor new infectious diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019. This information could enable better preparation and planning of health care systems.","Kurian, Shyam J; Bhatti, Atiq Ur Rehman; Alvi, Mohammed Ali; Ting, Henry H; Storlie, Curtis; Wilson, Patrick M; Shah, Nilay D; Liu, Hongfang; Bydon, Mohamad",Mayo Clin Proc,,311

Yet, to move diversity science forward, innovative methods that explicitly center the experiences of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) who encounter multiple forms of marginalization must be adopted. One such approach is intersectional mixed methods research-a methodological approach that uses intersectionality theory to guide the use of both quantitative and qualitative methods within a single study. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that intersectional mixed methods research includes four tenets: (1) research questions prioritize multiply marginalized BIPOC individuals, (2) the multiple realities of BIPOC individuals are honored and embraced, (3) identity-related variables (e.g., self-reported discrimination) are studied alongside systems-level variables (e.g., structural racism), and (4) scholars engage in critical reflexivity. We also propose that intersectional mixed methods research can advance scholarship on multiply marginalized BIPOC individuals by fulfilling one of five purposes: Triangulation, complementarity, expansion, development, and initiation.

299043,The lower respiratory tract microbiome of critically ill patients with COVID-19,2021,"Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic there is a need for a rapid increase in intensive care and ventilation capacities. Delivery times for additional intensive care respirators are currently not foreseeable. An option to increase ventilation capacities not only for COVID-19, but for all patients requiring mechanical ventilation is to use home respirators. Home respirators are turbine respirators, so they can usually be operated without high-pressure oxygen connections and can therefore also be used in areas outside the classical intensive care medical infrastructure. Due to their limited technical features, home respirators are not suitable for the treatment of severely affected patients but can be used for weaning after respiratory improvement, which means that intensive care respirators are available again more quickly. Respiratory therapists are specially trained nurses or therapists in the field of out of hospital ventilation and can independently use home ventilation respirators, for example for weaning in the intensive care unit. Thus, they relieve intensive care nursing staff in the pandemic. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic medical students from the Oldenburg University are currently being trained in operating home respirators to provide basic support in the hospital if necessary.","Summ, O; Schute, J; Byhahn, C; Kahle, T; Herrmann, M; Schulte, C; Bergold, M N; Groß, M",Anaesthesist,,311

As initial actions, we recommended that routine screening be suspended and that patients with early and advanced cancer be treated as outpatients as much as possible and at the nearest medical center. Patients who need to be hospitalized for cancer treatment were protected from potential SARS-CoV-2 infection by creating a dedicated diagnostic and therapeutic internal pathway for cancer treatment. We implemented reorganization of the hospital networks, based on a hub-and-spoke design. Stronger personal protection was made available for patients with cancer. Because of the extreme burden created by COVID-19, antitumor treatment was initiated only after considering patient performance status, comorbidities, biology of disease, and the likely impact of treatment on outcome.

By 30 Sep 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the number of cases worldwide had reached 34 million with more than one million deaths. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) registered the first case of COVID-19 on 2 Mar 2020. Since then, the number of infections has been increasing gradually on a daily basis. On 20 Sep 2020, the KSA reported 334,605 cases, with 319,154 recoveries and 4,768 deaths. The KSA has taken several measures to control the spread of COVID-19, especially during the Umrah and Hajj events of 1441, including stopping Umrah and performing this year's Hajj in reduced numbers from within the Kingdom, and imposing a curfew on the cities of the Kingdom from 23 Mar to 28 May 2020. In this article, two statistical models were used to measure the impact of the curfew on the spread of COVID-19 in KSA. The two models are Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and Spatial Time-Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (STARIMA) model. We used the data obtained from 31 May to 11 October 2020 to assess the model of STARIMA for the COVID-19 confirmation cases in (Makkah, Jeddah, and Taif) in KSA. The results show that STARIMA models are more reliable in forecasting future epidemics of COVID-19 than ARIMA models. We demonstrated the preference of STARIMA models over ARIMA models during the period in which the curfew was lifted.","Awwad, Fuad A; Mohamoud, Moataz A; Abonazel, Mohamed R",PLoS One,,311

ACE2 functions as a carboxymonopeptidase hydrolyzing the cleavage of a single C-terminal residue from Angiotensin-II (Ang-II), the key peptide hormone of RAS, to form Angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)), which binds to the G-protein-coupled Mas receptor and activates signaling pathways that counteract the pathways activated by Ang-II. ACE2 is expressed in a variety of tissues and overwhelming evidence substantiates the beneficial effects of enhancing ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis under many pathological conditions in these tissues in experimental models. This review will provide a succinct overview on current strategies to enhance ACE2 as therapeutic agent, and discuss limitations and future challenges. ACE2 also has other functions, such as acting as a co-factor for amino acid transport and being exploited by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) as cellular entry receptor, the implications of these functions in development of ACE2-based therapeutics will also be discussed.","Li, Qiuhong; Grant, Maria B; Richards, Elaine M; Raizada, Mohan K",Clin Sci (Lond),,311

It takes into account the known special characteristics of this disease such as the existence of infectious undetected cases and the different social and infectiousness conditions of infected people. In particular, it considers the social structure and governmental measures in a country, the fraction of detected cases over the real total infected cases, and the influx of undetected infected people from outside the borders. Although the model is simple and allows a reasonable identification of its parameters, using the data provided by local authorities on this pandemic, it is also complex enough to capture the most important effects. We study the particular case of Lebanon and use its reported data to estimate the model parameters, which can be of interest for estimating the spread of COVID-19 in other countries. We show a good agreement between the reported data and the estimations given by our model. We also simulate several scenarios that help policy makers in deciding how to loosen different measures without risking a severe wave of COVID-19. We are also able to identify the main factors that lead to specific scenarios which helps in a better understanding of the spread of the virus.","Mourad, Ayman; Mroue, Fatima",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03264v1.pdf,311

The disease can be spread by both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals. Uncertainty remains over key aspects of the virus infectiousness (particularly the newly emerging variants) and the disease has had severe economic impacts globally. For these reasons, COVID-19 is the subject of intense and widespread discussion on social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter. These public forums substantially influence public opinions and in some cases can exacerbate the widespread panic and misinformation spread during the crisis. Thus, this work aimed to design an intelligent clustering-based classification and topic extracting model named TClustVID that analyzes COVID-19-related public tweets to extract significant sentiments with high accuracy. We gathered COVID-19 Twitter datasets from the IEEE Dataport repository and employed a range of data preprocessing methods to clean the raw data, then applied tokenization and produced a word-to-index dictionary. Thereafter, different classifications were employed on these datasets which enabled the exploration of the performance of traditional classification and TClustVID. Our analysis found that TClustVID showed higher performance compared to traditional methodologies that are determined by clustering criteria. Finally, we extracted significant topics from the clusters, split them into positive, neutral and negative sentiments, and identified the most frequent topics using the proposed model. This approach is able to rapidly identify commonly prevailing aspects of public opinions and attitudes related to COVID-19 and infection prevention strategies spreading among different populations.","Satu, Md Shahriare; Khan, Md Imran; Mahmud, Mufti; Uddin, Shahadat; Summers, Matthew A; Quinn, Julian M W; Moni, Mohammad Ali",Knowl Based Syst,,311

This is to address the specific research question on how social capital (contacts and connections) is deployed (via capability-based higher order meta-skills) in a UK university developing the employability of a specific group of students. The article is situated in the highly fraught context of teaching excellence measurement schemes [such as the teaching excellence framework (TEF) in the UK].FindingsThe research findings highlighted the role of social capital and higher order meta-skills in developing the employability of marketing students at a UK university.Research limitations/implicationsWhile the illustrative primary data are not generalisable, as they are limited to one group of marketing students in one UK university;the conceptual development, including a new social capital based definition of employability that incorporated the capabilities, provided by higher-order meta-skills, is widely applicable.Practical implicationsThe article has highlighted how the impact of social capital, etiquette and meta-skills, while being “between the lines” of the employability discourse and the metrics of the TEF, explains the differing perceptions of the value of employability initiatives. The article highlights the grey area of between the reasons given as to why some candidates are valued over others. Perhaps no rhyme or reason sometimes, just the “hidden” perception/interpretations of the interview panel of the “qualities” of one candidate over another.Originality/valueThe difficulty in ascertaining the influence of social capital (and how it can be deployed through higher-order meta-skills as capabilities) results in challenges for universities as they endeavour to respond to the data requirements of “learning gain” within teaching excellent measurement schemes such as the UK teaching excellence framework.","Barkas, Linda Anne Scott Jonathan Matthew Hadley Karen Dixon-Todd Yvonne",Education &amp; Training,,311

Despite a historical context of public health crises, data sharing agreements and transactional standards do not uniformly exist between institutions which hamper a foundational infrastructure to meet data sharing and integration needs for the advancement of public health. Approach: There is a growing need to apply population health knowledge with technological solutions to data transfer, integration, and reasoning, to improve health in a broader learning health system ecosystem. To achieve this, data must be combined from healthcare provider organizations, public health departments, and other settings. Public health entities are in a unique position to consume these data, however, most do not yet have the infrastructure required to integrate data sources and apply computable knowledge to combat this pandemic. Outcomes: Herein, we describe lessons learned and a framework to address these needs, which focus on: (a) identifying and filling technology ""gaps""; (b) pursuing collaborative design of data sharing requirements and transmission mechanisms; (c) facilitating cross-domain discussions involving legal and research compliance; and (d) establishing or participating in multi-institutional convening or coordinating activities.

All these internet-based resources enable the pursuit of a flexible, independent, self-motivated and self-directed way of learning that fits perfectly with the increasing limitations of time, space and speed of modern day learners.These resources have played a significant role in filling the void of conventional education during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Moreover, with their widespread diffusion throughout communities of Pathologists from all over the world they help to reduce the educational gap between resource-rich and resource-poor countries, having the potential to become standardized knowledge-sharing platforms and to be incorporated into curricula at any level.pathCast is one of the most robust and reliable open-access online remote learning platforms for pathologists, which live-streams lectures across the world. In the present paper we describe its structure, its acceptance by the global community of pathologists, what innovation elements has introduced regarding methodologies for education and its powerful and positive impact for residency training and continuing life-long education of practicing pathologists. A comprehensive list of the pathCast lectures with the respective links is also provided along with a brief discussion on other freely accessible online educational resources for pathologists.","Cima, Luca; Mannan, Rifat; Madrigal, Emilio; Barbareschi, Mattia",Pathologica,,311

In this context, the need for speed is taken for granted, and the scientific process has adapted to accommodate this. On the surface, attempts to speed up the research enterprise appear to be a good thing. It is, however, important to consider what, if anything, might be lost when biomedical innovation is sped up. In this article we use the case of a study recently retracted from the Lancet to illustrate the potential risks and harms associated with speeding up science. We then argue that, with appropriate governance mechanisms in place (and adequately resourced), it should be quite possible to both speed up science and remain attentive to scientific quality and integrity.","Lipworth, Wendy; Gentgall, Melanie; Kerridge, Ian; Stewart, Cameron",J. bioeth. inq,,311

Image segmentation methods have proven to help quantify the disease burden and even help predict the outcome. The availability of longitudinal CT series may also result in an efficient and effective method to reliably assess the progression of COVID-19, monitor the healing process and the response to different therapeutic strategies. In this paper, we propose a new framework to identify infection at a voxel level (identification of healthy lung, consolidation, and ground-glass opacity) and visualize the progression of COVID-19 using sequential low-dose non-contrast CT scans. In particular, we devise a longitudinal segmentation network that utilizes the reference scan information to improve the performance of disease identification.

The question remains, however: who else should be prioritised for immunisation? Here, we call attention to individuals institutionalised with severe mental illnesses and/or developmental or intellectual disabilities-a group highly susceptible to the damages of COVID-19, recent research shows, and critical to consider for priority vaccination. The language describing both federal-level and state-level intentions for this population remains largely vague, despite the population's diversity across age, diagnosis, functional status and living arrangement. Such absence of specificity, in turn, leaves room for confusion and even neglect of various subgroups. We review data stressing this group's vulnerability, as well as select state plans for priority vaccination, highlighting the importance of clarity when describing intentions to vaccinate, or even generally care for, diverse populations composed of distinct subgroups in need.","Shevzov-Zebrun, Nina; Caplan, Arthur L",J. med. ethics,,311

For those living with migraine and headache disorders, stigma limits the full expression of their lives, as well as the likelihood of receiving health care to reduce the burden. In the past decade, public advocacy organizations have emerged in the United States and internationally to counter the consequences of this stigma. These organizations have raised public awareness of these diseases, corrected misconceptions, and empowered millions of people affected by them. The Alliance for Headache Disorders Advocacy has focused on addressing the structural stigma inherent in discriminatory policies of employers, government agencies, and public institutions.

There is currently no quantitative method for acoustic coupling verification in ultrasound-guided FUS. In this work, a quantitative method was developed and a related metric was introduced: the acoustic coupling coefficient. This metric associates the adequacy of the acoustic coupling with the reflected signals recorded through an imaging probe during a low-energy sonication. The acoustic coupling issue was simulated in silico and validated through in vitro tests. Our results indicated a sigmoidal behavior of the introduced metric as the contact surface between the coupling system and the patient's skin increases. The proposed method could be a safety-check criterion for verifying the adequacy of the acoustic coupling before starting the FUS treatment, thus ensuring efficient energy transmission to the target and preventing damage to both the patient and the instrumentation.","Morchi, Laura; Mariani, Andrea; Diodato, Alessandro; Tognarelli, Selene; Cafarelli, Andrea; Menciassi, Arianna",Ultrasound med. biol,,311

318310,Tocilizumab for the treatment of adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia: A single-center cohort study,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a substantial stressor that could eventuate in psychological distress. Evidence suggests that individuals previously exposed to traumatic events, and particularly to continuous traumatic stress (CTS), might be more vulnerable to distress when facing additional stressors. This study aimed to investigate these suppositions in the context of the ongoing shelling of Israel from the Israel-Gaza border, which continues even amidst the COVID-19 crisis. METHOD: An online survey was conducted among Israel's general population. The sample included 976 participants. Seven-hundred-and-ninety-three participants had been exposed to traumatic events, with 255 participants reporting CTS. Trauma exposure, COVID-19-related stressors, and psychological distress related to COVID-19 (anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms) were assessed. RESULTS: Most participants reported experiencing at least one psychiatric symptom related to COVID-19. Being younger, female, not in a relationship, having a below-average income, being diagnosed with the disease, living alone during the outbreak, having a close other in a high-risk group, and negatively self-rating one's health status were associated with elevated distress. Individuals who had been exposed to trauma, and to CTS in particular, had elevated anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms compared to individuals without such a history or to survivors of non-ongoing traumatic events. CTS moderated the relations between PTSD symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and peritraumatic stress symptoms, with significantly stronger relations found among individuals exposed to CTS. LIMITATIONS: This study relied on convenience sampling. CONCLUSIONS: Trauma survivors, and particularly traumatized individuals exposed to CTS, seem at risk for psychological distress related to COVID-19.","Lahav, Yael",J Affect Disord,,311
320072,Effect of Bamlanivimab as Monotherapy or in Combination With Etesevimab on Viral Load in Patients With Mild to Moderate COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial,2021,"PURPOSE: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is accompanied by a dysfunctional immune-inflammatory response following lung injury, including during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Limited causal biomarkers exist for ARDS development. We sought to identify novel genetic susceptibility targets for ARDS to focus further investigation on their biological mechanism and therapeutic potential. METHODS: Meta-analyses of ARDS genome-wide association studies were performed with 1250 cases and 1583 controls in Europeans, and 387 cases and 387 controls in African Americans. The functionality of novel loci was determined in silico using multiple omics approaches. The causality of 114 factors potentially involved in ARDS development was assessed using Mendelian Randomization analysis. RESULTS: There was distinct genetic heterogeneity in ARDS between Europeans and African Americans. rs7967111 at 12p13.2 was functionally associated with ARDS susceptibility in Europeans (odds ratio = 1.38; P = 2.15 × 10-8). Expression of two genes annotated at this locus, BORCS5 and DUSP16, was dynamic but ultimately decreased during ARDS development, as well as downregulated in immune cells alongside COVID-19 severity. Causal inference implied that comorbidity of inflammatory bowel disease and elevated levels of C-reactive protein and interleukin-10 causally increased ARDS risk, while vitamin D supplementation and vasodilator use ameliorated risk. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a novel susceptibility locus in ARDS pathophysiology that implicates BORCS5 and DUSP16 as potentially acting in immune-inflammatory processes. This locus warrants further investigation to inform the development of therapeutic targets and clinical care strategies for ARDS, including those induced by COVID-19.","Du, Mulong; Garcia, Joe G N; Christie, Jason D; Xin, Junyi; Cai, Guoshuai; Meyer, Nuala J; Zhu, Zhaozhong; Yuan, Qianyu; Zhang, Zhengdong; Su, Li; Shen, Sipeng; Dong, Xuesi; Li, Hui; Hutchinson, John N; Tejera, Paula; Lin, Xihong; Wang, Meilin; Chen, Feng; Christiani, David C",Intensive Care Med,,311

It analyzes materials posted on the internet and social after the first case of COVID 19-related death in Brazil that are related health promotion and COVID-19 aimed at orienting society's response to the pandemic. The analysis considers two key factors: the mismanagement of the pandemic by the Brazilian government and infodemic. There is complex use of scientific information with recommendations that focus on what people should do (intervention) and in transforming individuals' behaviors, based on an ideal model of healthy behaviors. Narratives aimed to delegate to the population and specific groups the task of taking care of themselves have been reinforced, removing from the State the responsibility to offer conditions for the population to address the situation. There is a sophistication of strategies that blame individual practices, personal organization and that are disconnected from the collective, especially for those who live in situation of extreme vulnerability. Concomitantly, there are also discourses based on notions of solidarity and renewed social connections, which are empowering and consistent with the practice of health promotion as it attributes meanings to the subjects and their ways of life. We conclude that greatest advocacy in the field of health promotion at this moment is political and could be directed toward reaffirming health promotion principles, supporting permanent mobilization against setbacks in the public sphere and defending a new, democratic, inclusive and collective vision of society.","Franceschini, Maria Cristina Trousdell; Agrela de Andrade, Elisabete; Mendes, Rosilda; Akerman, Marco; Roque Andrade, Douglas; Madalena de Campos Lico, Fatima",Health promot. internation,,311
322562,"Clinical characteristics and factors associated with hospital admission or death in 43,103 adult outpatients with COVID-19 managed with the Covidom telesurveillance solution: a prospective cohort study",2021,"OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to describe the clinical characteristics of febrile infants younger than 90 days with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, to investigate the prevalence of serious bacterial infections (SBIs) in these infants, and to compare the risk of SBI in SARS-CoV-2-positive febrile infants with sex- and age-matched SARS-CoV- 2-negative febrile infants. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted from March to November 2020 in a tertiary children's hospital. Patients were identified by International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes and included if age was younger than 90 days, a SARS-CoV-2 test was performed, and at least 1 bacterial culture was collected. Positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 were age- and sex-matched to negative controls for analysis. Serious bacterial infection was defined as a urinary tract infection, bacterial enteritis, bacteremia, and/or bacterial meningitis. RESULTS: Fifty-three SARS-CoV-2-positive infants were identified with a higher rate of respiratory symptoms and lower white blood cell and C-reactive protein values than their SARS-CoV-2 matched controls. The rate of SBI in the SARS-CoV-2-positive infants was 8% compared with 34% in the controls; the most common infections were urinary tract infections (6% vs 23%). There were no cases of bacteremia or bacterial meningitis in the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) infants and 2 (4%) cases of bacteremia in the controls. The relative risk of any SBI between the 2 groups was 0.22 (95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.6; P &#8804; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that febrile infants younger than 90 days with COVID-19 have lower rates of SBI than their matched SARS-CoV-2-negative controls. These data are consistent with previous studies describing lower risks of SBI in febrile infants with concomitant viral respiratory tract infections.","Payson, Alison; Etinger, Veronica; Napky, Pablo; Montarroyos, Stephanie; Ruiz-Castaneda, Ana; Mestre, Marcos",Pediatr Emerg Care,,311

Thus, we aimed to examine ED utilization among pediatric patients and the impact of COVID-19 in one large city affected by the outbreak. METHODS: This retrospective study included data from six EDs in Daegu, Korea. We compared the demographic and clinical data of patients presenting to the ED during the COVID-19 pandemic (February 1st-June 30th 2020) with those of patients who visited the ED in this period during 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: Fewer patients, particularly children visited the EDs during the study period in 2020 than those in the previous (2018/2019) year period: the number of adult patient decreased by 46.4% and children by 76.9%. Although the number of patients increased from the lowest point of the decrease in March 2020, the number of pediatric patients visiting the ED remained less than half (45.2%) in June 2020 compared with that of previous years. The proportion of patients with severe conditions increased in adults, infants, and school-aged children, and consequently resulted in increased ambulance use and higher hospitalization rates. Fewer infants and young children but more school-aged children visited the ED with febrile illnesses in 2020 than in 2018/2019. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a substantial decrease in pediatric ED utilization. These findings can help reallocate human and material resources in the EDs during infectious disease outbreaks.","Jang, Kyung Mi; Ahn, Ji Young; Choi, Hee Joung; Lee, Sukhee; Kim, Dongsub; Lee, Dong Won; Choe, Jae Young",J Korean Med Sci,,311

Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) in Physical Therapy (PT) Study (FM-TIPS) is a pragmatic, cluster-randomized clinical trial examining if the addition of TENS to routine PT improves movement-evoked pain in fibromyalgia (FM). FM patients (n=600) were enrolled from 24 PT clinics (12 PT only, 12 PT with TENS) across five healthcare systems. COVID-19 has significantly impacted PT practice and in-person interactions. In response, all PT clinics saw reduced volumes of patients, some clinics furloughed PTs, and some clinics were permanently closed. This led us to put contracts, reliance agreements, and training of clinics on hold and to seek additional clinics that could fill the gap for those who could no longer participate. It also led to a delay in onboarding healthcare systems and inpatient enrollment. In order to protect the integrity of the study and minimize missing data due to potential restrictions of in-person visits we developed alternative strategies. This includes procedures for home instruction of TENS via telehealth, a plan for bringing on backup clinics, and a plan for training virtually and in-person using personal protective equipment and social distancing. Assessment of primary outcome and questionnaire data were transitioned for the patient to perform at home through a patient-portal with embedded patient-specific videos. We have also set up a phone line for patients to call with additional questions or concerns. The impact of COVID-19 on statistical design and analysis was discussed including a plan for uneven enrollment across clinics and a sub-analysis of data for patients enrolled during or after the pandemic.

RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-one extubated patients were included (mean age, 61.0 years [±13.9]; 54.8% male). Reintubation occurred in 93 (33.1%). In multivariate analysis accounting for death, reintubation risk increased with age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.04 per 1-year increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 -1.06), vasopressors (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.04-3.60), renal replacement (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.22-3.29), maximum PEEP (HR 1.07 per 1-unit increase, 95% CI 1.02 -1.12), paralytics (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.08-2.25) and requiring more than nasal cannula immediately post-extubation (HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.37-3.50). Reintubation was associated with higher mortality (36.6% vs 2.1%; P < 0.0001) and risk of inpatient death after adjusting for multiple factors (HR 23.2, 95% CI 6.45-83.33). Prone ventilation, corticosteroids, anticoagulation, remdesivir and tocilizumab did not impact the risk of reintubation or death. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 1 in 3 critically ill COVID-19 patients required reintubation. Older age, paralytics, high PEEP, need for greater respiratory support following extubation and non-pulmonary organ failure predicted reintubation. Extubation failure strongly predicted adverse outcomes.","Ionescu, Filip; Zimmer, Markie S; Petrescu, Ioana; Castillo, Edward; Bozyk, Paul; Abbas, Amr; Abplanalp, Lauren; Dogra, Sanjay; Nair, Girish B",J Intensive Care Med,,311
331651,Basics of mechanical ventilation for non-anaesthetists. Part 1: Theoretical aspects,2020,"BACKGROUNDSince December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, and is now becoming a global threat. We aimed to delineate and compare the immunological features of severe and moderate COVID-19.METHODSIn this retrospective study, the clinical and immunological characteristics of 21 patients (17 male and 4 female) with COVID-19 were analyzed. These patients were classified as severe (11 cases) and moderate (10 cases) according to the guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China.RESULTSThe median age of severe and moderate cases was 61.0 and 52.0 years, respectively. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, and fatigue. Compared with moderate cases, severe cases more frequently had dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;. Absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were markedly lower in severe cases (294.0, 177.5, and 89.0 × 106/L, respectively) than moderate cases (640.5, 381.5, and 254.0 × 106/L, respectively). The expression of IFN-Î³ by CD4+ T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.1%) than in moderate cases (22.8%).CONCLUSIONThe SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, resulting in a decrease in numbers as well as IFN-Î³ production by CD4+ T cells. These potential immunological markers may be of importance because of their correlation with disease severity in COVID-19.TRIAL REGISTRATIONThis is a retrospective observational study without a trial registration number.FUNDINGThis work is funded by grants from Tongji Hospital for the Pilot Scheme Project, and partly supported by the Chinese National Thirteenth Five Years Project in Science and Technology for Infectious Disease (2017ZX10202201).","Chen, Guang; Wu, Di; Guo, Wei; Cao, Yong; Huang, Da; Wang, Hongwu; Wang, Tao; Zhang, Xiaoyun; Chen, Huilong; Yu, Haijing; Zhang, Xiaoping; Zhang, Minxia; Wu, Shiji; Song, Jianxin; Chen, Tao; Han, Meifang; Li, Shusheng; Luo, Xiaoping; Zhao, Jianping; Ning, Qin",J Clin Invest,,311

332791,Case Study of Pediatric Cerebral Sinus Venous Thrombosis Center of a Low Middle-Income Country,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that causes a disease which can leads to a severe form of fatal pneumonia. At december 2020 in Italy, more than 2 million people have contracted the virus and 78,755 people have died. The scientific community is studying and testing numerous compounds that can be effective and safe for treating people with covid-19. AIM: To synthesize and evaluate the quality of evidence of efficacy and safety for the treatment. The available evidence is summarized in a living systematic review, a review that is constantly updated on the basis of the results of the new clinical studies. METHODS: A bibliographic search is launched weekly on the electronic databases and on the main clinical trial registers. Two researchers independently select the articles and assess the quality of the studies using the criteria developed by the Cochrane Collaboration, the certainty of the overall quality of the evidence is assessed using the GRADE criteria. RESULTS: At 31/12/2020, 101 randomized controlled studies were included that consider 72 different comparisons and include a total of 55,281 patients. 37 drugs are tested with respect to the standard treatment, 6 are evaluated against placebo and finally 29 compare different drugs with each other. By selecting studies that evaluate the efficacy and safety of a drug compared to standard treatment, which include at least 2 studies and which have low to high certainty of evidence, results show that corticosteroids, remdesivir, favipiravir, immunoglobulins, colchicine, and umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell infusion could reduce overall mortality. No differences for the risk of any adverse events are observed between convalescent plasma and remdesivir compared to standard treatment. Remdesivir probably reduces the risk of serious adverse events; a similar effect, although less strong, is also noted for tocilizumab and the lopinavir-ritonavir combination. In contrast, hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids and convalescent plasma transfusion are associated with safety concerns with respect to the risk of serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The 101 studies included consider 72 comparisons and numerous outcomes, the results often coming from single studies and of small dimensions, and for 61% with a very low certainty of evidence, are difficult to summarize and the final result is to increase the uncertainty rather than providing useful information to the clinic and research. From all the work carried out it seems to us that the pandemic has highlighted the many shadows of scientific literature as tool to improve knowledge.","Cruciani, Fabio; Amato, Laura; De Crescenzo, Franco; Mitrova, Zuzana; Saulle, Rosella; Vecchi, Simona; Davoli, Marina",Recenti Prog Med,,311

335833,The efficacy and safety of bamlanivimab treatment against COVID-19: A meta-analysis,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 incidence and mortality in Europe have shown wide variation. Northern Italy in particular the Lombardy region, north-eastern French regions, Switzerland and Belgium were amongst the hardest hit, while the central and southern Italian regions, all the Balkan countries from Slovenia to Greece and the Islands of Malta and Cyprus had much fewer cases and deaths per capita, and deaths per number of cases. Differences in public health measures, and health care delivery, in the author's opinion, can only partly explain the difference. The geographical distribution of Phlebotomus sand-flies and the relative distribution of arthropod borne diseases Leishmaniasis and Phlebovirus infections especially the Sicilian Sandfly fever group corresponds to most areas of low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. A hypothesis is proposed whereby repeated arthropod or sandfly vector infection of humans by novel viruses of zoonotic origins carrying bat or mammalian RNA/DNA, such as phleboviruses may have resulted in the development of an effective evolutionary immune response to most novel zoonotic viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 by means of survival of the fittest possibly over many generations. This process probably ran in parallel and concurrent with the progressive evolution of novel coronaviruses which spread from one mammalian species to another. Other possible, but less likely mechanisms for the role of sandfly meals within a much shorter time frame may have led to, (i) previous exposure and infection of humans with the SARS-Cov-2 virus itself, or a closely related corona virus in the previous decades, or (ii) exposure of human populations to parts coronavirus protein namely either S or more likely N protein carried mechanically by arthropods, but without clinical disease causing direct immunity or (iii) by causing infection with other arthropod borne viruses which could carry bat DNA/RNA and have similar functional proteins resulting in an immediate cross-reactive immune response rather than by natural selection. The Evidence possibly supporting or disputing this hypothesis is reviewed, however the major problem with the hypothesis is that to date no coronavirus has ever been isolated from arthropods. Such a hypothesis can only be supported by research investigating the possible biological relationship of arthropods and coronaviruses where paradoxically they may be promoting immunity rather than disease.","Balzan, Martin",Med Hypotheses,,311

The current study explored the relationships between ATs, emotional response to COVID-19, and the behavioural immune system (BIS) measured by trait pathogen avoidance and COVID-19 risk perception in the general population. The results showed that ATs predicted increased negative emotions directly and indirectly by enhancing the activation tendency of BIS and COVID-19 risk perception. The findings provide a candidate hypothesis for the reaction characteristics to pathogen threats in individuals with ASD and expand the understanding of individual differences in response to COVID-19.","Zhao, Xudong; Shi, Wendian; Li, Xiujun; Li, Wenrui; Li, Chunbo",Psychiatry Res,,311

Given the urgency to release coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) serology tests, most manufacturers have developed qualitative tests. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical performance of six different SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and their quantitative results to better elucidate the clinical role of serology testing in COVID-19. DESIGN: Six SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays were tested using remnant specimens from 190 patients. Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated for each assay with the current manufacturer's cutoff and a lower cutoff. A numeric result analysis and discrepancy analysis were performed Results: The specificity was >93% for all assays, and sensitivity was >80% for all assays (&#8805; 7 days post-polymerase chain reaction [PCR] testing). Inpatients with more severe disease had higher numeric values compared to health care workers with mild or moderate disease. Several discrepant serology results were those just below the manufacturers cutoff. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing can aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19 especially with negative PCR. Quantitative COVID-19 IgG results are important to better understand the immunological response and disease course of this novel virus and to assess immunity as part of future vaccination programs.","Forest, Stefanie K; Orner, Erika P; Goldstein, D Yitzchak; Wirchnianski, Ariel S; Bortz, Robert H; Laudermilch, Ethan; Florez, Catalina; Malonis, Ryan J; Georgiev, George I; Vergnolle, Olivia; Lo, Yungtai; Campbell, Sean T; Barnhill, Jason; Cadoff, Evan M; Lai, Jonathan R; Chandran, Kartik; Weiss, Louis M; Fox, Amy S; Prystowsky, Michael B; Wolgast, Lucia R",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

337535,"Pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patients: prevalence, predictors and clinical outcome",2020,"Nowadays, there is an increasing demand for more accessible routine diagnostics for patients with respect to high accuracy, ease of use, and low cost. However, the quantitative and high accuracy bioassays in large hospitals and laboratories usually require trained technicians and equipment that is both bulky and expensive. In addition, the multistep bioassays and long turnaround time could severely affect the disease surveillance and control especially in pandemics such as influenza and COVID-19. In view of this, a portable, quantitative bioassay device will be valuable in regions with scarce medical resources and help relieve burden on local healthcare systems. Herein, we introduce the MagiCoil diagnostic device, an inexpensive, portable, quantitative, and rapid bioassay platform based on the magnetic particle spectrometer (MPS) technique. MPS detects the dynamic magnetic responses of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and uses the harmonics from oscillating MNPs as metrics for sensitive and quantitative bioassays. This device does not require trained technicians to operate and employs a fully automatic, one-step, and wash-free assay with a user friendly smartphone interface. Using a streptavidin-biotin binding system as a model, we show that the detection limit of the current portable device for streptavidin is 64 nM (equal to 5.12 pmole). In addition, this MPS technique is very versatile and allows for the detection of different diseases just by changing the surface modifications on MNPs. Although MPS-based bioassays show high sensitivities as reported in many literatures, at the current stage, this portable device faces insufficient sensitivity and needs further improvements. It is foreseen that this kind of portable device can transform the multistep, laboratory-based bioassays to one-step field testing in nonclinical settings such as schools, homes, offices, etc.","Wu, Kai; Chugh, Vinit Kumar; di Girolamo, Arturo; Liu, Jinming; Saha, Renata; Su, Diqing; Krishna, Venkatramana D; Nair, Abilash; Davies, Will; Wang, Yongqiang Andrew; Cheeran, Maxim C-J; Wang, Jian-Ping",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,,311

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) possesses a nonstructural protein (nsp14), with amino-terminal domain coding for proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) that is required for high-fidelity replication. The ability of CoVs during genome replication and transcription to proofread and exclude mismatched nucleotides has long hindered the development of anti-CoV drugs. The resistance of SARS-CoV-2 to antivirals, especially nucleoside analogs (NAs), shows the need to identify new CoV inhibition targets. Therefore, this review highlights the importance of nsp14-ExoN as a target for inhibition. Also, nucleoside analogs could be used in combination with existing anti-CoV therapeutics to target the proofreading mechanism.","Tahir, Mohammed",J Med Virol,,311

The relevance of the subject stems from the key role of airborne virus transmission by viral particles released by an infected person via coughing, sneezing, speaking or simply breathing. Speech droplets generated by asymptomatic disease carriers are also considered for their viral load and potential for infection. Proper understanding of the mechanics of the complex processes whereby the two-phase flow emitted by an infected individual disperses into the environment would allow us to infer from first principles the practical rules to be imposed on social distancing and on the use of facial and eye protection, which to date have been adopted on a rather empirical basis. These measures need compelling scientific validation. A deeper understanding of the relevant biological fluid dynamics would also allow us to evaluate the contrasting effects of natural or forced ventilation of environments on the transmission of contagion: the risk decreases as the viral load is diluted by mixing effects but contagion is potentially allowed to reach larger distances from the infected source. To that end, our survey supports the view that a formal assessment of a number of open problems is needed. They are outlined in the discussion.","Seminara, Giovanni; Carli, Bruno; Forni, Guido; Fuzzi, Sandro; Mazzino, Andrea; Rinaldo, Andrea",Rend Lincei Sci Fis Nat,,311

The novelty of the virus prompts a search for understanding of how ecological factors affect the transmission and survival of the virus. Several studies have robustly identified a relationship between temperature and the number of cases. However, there is no specific study for a tropical climate such as Brazil. This work aims to determine the relationship of temperature to COVID-19 infection for the state capital cities of Brazil. Cumulative data with the daily number of confirmed cases was collected from February 27 to April 1, 2020, for all 27 state capital cities of Brazil affected by COVID-19. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to explore the linear and nonlinear relationship between annual average temperature compensation and confirmed cases. Also, a polynomial linear regression model was proposed to represent the behavior of the growth curve of COVID-19 in the capital cities of Brazil. The GAM dose-response curve suggested a negative linear relationship between temperatures and daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the range from 16.8 °C to 27.4 °C. Each 1 °C rise of temperature was associated with a -4.8951% (t = -2.29, p = 0.0226) decrease in the number of daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19. A sensitivity analysis assessed the robustness of the results of the model. The predicted R-squared of the polynomial linear regression model was 0.81053. In this study, which features the tropical temperatures of Brazil, the variation in annual average temperatures ranged from 16.8 °C to 27.4 °C. Results indicated that temperatures had a negative linear relationship with the number of confirmed cases. The curve flattened at a threshold of 25.8 °C. There is no evidence supporting that the curve declined for temperatures above 25.8 °C. The study had the goal of supporting governance for healthcare policymakers.","Prata, David N; Rodrigues, Waldecy; Bermejo, Paulo H",Sci Total Environ,,311
349086,Patient Perspectives in the Era of Remote Medical Visits During the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic ― Insights From Outpatient Care of Cardiovascular Disease ―,2021,"BACKGROUND: There is considerable variation in disease behavior among patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Genomewide association analysis may allow for the identification of potential genetic factors involved in the development of Covid-19. METHODS: We conducted a genomewide association study involving 1980 patients with Covid-19 and severe disease (defined as respiratory failure) at seven hospitals in the Italian and Spanish epicenters of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe. After quality control and the exclusion of population outliers, 835 patients and 1255 control participants from Italy and 775 patients and 950 control participants from Spain were included in the final analysis. In total, we analyzed 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and conducted a meta-analysis of the two case-control panels. RESULTS: We detected cross-replicating associations with rs11385942 at locus 3p21.31 and with rs657152 at locus 9q34.2, which were significant at the genomewide level (P<5×10-8) in the meta-analysis of the two case-control panels (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48 to 2.11; P = 1.15×10-10; and odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.47; P = 4.95×10-8, respectively). At locus 3p21.31, the association signal spanned the genes SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6 and XCR1. The association signal at locus 9q34.2 coincided with the ABO blood group locus; in this cohort, a blood-group-specific analysis showed a higher risk in blood group A than in other blood groups (odds ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.75; P = 1.48×10-4) and a protective effect in blood group O as compared with other blood groups (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.79; P = 1.06×10-5). CONCLUSIONS: We identified a 3p21.31 gene cluster as a genetic susceptibility locus in patients with Covid-19 with respiratory failure and confirmed a potential involvement of the ABO blood-group system.

We previously reported the frequent occurrence of amyloid deposits in the ligament flavum in the presence of lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSCS), which is a common spinal disorder in older individuals. Our earlier clinicopathological studies revealed that amyloid deposits derived from transthyretin (TTR) were involved in the pathogenesis of LSCS. ATTR amyloid was the most common form in the ligamentum flavum, but amyloid deposits that were not identified still existed in more than 50% of patients with LSCS. In this study, we found apolipoprotein AI (AApoAI) amyloid deposits in the ligamentum flavum of patients with LSCS. The deposits occurred in 12% of patients with LSCS. Biochemical studies revealed that the amyloid deposits consisted mainly of full-length ApoAI. As a notable finding, the lumbar ligamentum flavum of patients who had LSCS with double-positive amyloid deposits-positive for both ATTR and AApoAI-was significantly thicker than that of patients who had LSCS with single-positive-that is, positive for either ATTR or AApoAI-amyloid deposits. We thus suggest that lumbar AApoAI amyloid formation may enhance the pathological changes of lumbar ATTR amyloidosis in patients with LSCS.","Tasaki, Masayoshi; Okada, Masamitsu; Yanagisawa, Akihiro; Nomura, Toshiya; Matsushita, Hiroaki; Ueda, Akihiko; Inoue, Yasuteru; Masuda, Teruaki; Misumi, Yohei; Yamashita, Taro; Nakamura, Takayuki; Miyamoto, Takeshi; Obayashi, Konen; Ando, Yukio; Ueda, Mitsuharu",Amyloid,,311

At the same time, the pandemic created an opportunity to teach biochemical and molecular biology concepts in the context of a topic with immediate global relevance, namely COVID19 and the virus that causes it. With little time to devise new materials to maximize learning in the new virtual environment, we set out to address this broad need by creating innovative, distance learning materials about the emerging COVID19 pandemic that are relevant, flexible, and timely, and available for dissemination to undergraduate faculty at diverse institutions. While highly disruptive, the pandemic also brought mainstream attention to a wide array of scientific concepts and provided an opportunity to educate students about the science of COVID19 through multidisciplinary approaches about science in real-time. Approaching this from many different disciplines, such as virology, immunology, biochemistry, genetics, public health, pharmacology, systems biology, and synthetic biology, we have brought together lessons devised by the authors and present a series of 25 curriculum modules that can be used either collectively or in parts to provide students with a multidisciplinary look at the virus. These modules are designed for both virtual and in person teaching and engages students to answer their own curiosity about the disease that will define their generation.","Tsotakos, Nikolaos Chihade Joseph Dal Gaizo-Moore Victoria Provost Joseph Roecklein-Canfield Jennifer Scheifele Lisa Wolyniak Michael",The FASEB Journal,,311

The restrictive measures adopted to minimize the diffusion of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) could alter the subjective dimension of well-being, so the objective of this study was to determine the factors related to life satisfaction of the Spanish population during forced home confinement derived from the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was designed, based on an online survey, and disseminated through the main social networks, which included the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and sociodemographic and COVID-19-related variables. The possible relationships between the different variables were studied using univariate and multivariable regression analyses. A total of 3261 subjects participated in the study. Factors associated with greater personal life satisfaction were fewer days of home confinement (ß = (-0.088); p &#8804; 0.001), the perception of having received enough information (ß = 0.076; p &#8804; 0.001), having private access to the outside (ß = 0.066; p &#8804; 0.001), being employed (ß = 0.063; p &#8804; 0.001), being male (ß = 0.057; p = 0.001) and not having been isolated (ß = 0.043; p = 0.013).

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of crank length manipulations on physiological and biomechanical aspects of recumbent handcycling performance in highly trained recumbent handcyclists at a constant linear handgrip speed and sport-specific intensity. Nine competitive handcyclists completed a 3-min trial in an adjustable recumbent handbike in four crank length settings (150, 160, 170 & 180 mm) at 70% peak power output. Handgrip speed was controlled (1.6 mâs-1 ) across trials with cadences ranging from 102 to 85 rpm. Physiological economy, heart rate and ratings of perceived exertion were monitored in all trials. Handcycling kinetics were quantified using an SRM (Schoberer Rad Messtechnik) powermeter and upper limb kinematics were determined using a 10-camera VICON motion capture system. Physiological responses were not significantly affected by crank length. However, greater torque was generated (p < 0.0005) and peak torque occurred earlier during the push and pull phase (p &#8804; 0.001) in longer cranks. Statistical parametric mapping revealed that the timing and orientation of shoulder flexion, shoulder abduction and elbow extension was significantly altered in different crank lengths. Despite the biomechanical adaptations, these findings suggest that at constant handgrip speeds (and varying cadence) highly trained handcyclists may select crank lengths between 150 - 180 mm without affecting their physiological performance. Until further research, factors such as anthropometrics, comfort and self-selected cadence should be used to facilitate crank length selection in recumbent handcyclists.","Mason, Barry S; Stone, Benjamin; Warner, Martin B; Goosey-Tolfrey, Victoria L",Scand. j. med. sci. sports,,311

Sixty-two patients were treated before 13 March 2020 (historic cohort) and 62 afterwards (covid cohort). Thirty-seven patients in the covid cohort additionally received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (mean duration of 3 months) consisting of bicalutamide 150 mg once a day for 4 weeks, with leuprolide 3.75 mg monthly injections commencing after week 1, up until the date of surgery.Results:Statistical analysis found no difference in peri-operative measures and length of stay for patients treated with or without neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy. Patients with delayed surgical treatment offered neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy showed a trend towards a reduction in positive surgical margins (p=0.134), N1 disease (p=0.424) and pathological down-staging (50% patients with pT2 disease).

The aim of this study was to verify the association of olfactory impairment and COVID-19, providing a basis for subsequent research in the field of COVID-19 clinical heterogeneity. METHODS: We developed a 15-item online questionnaire on ""Sudden Olfactory Loss (SOL) and COVID-19"" that was administered during March 2020 to Italian general practitioners registered to a social media group. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty responses were received. SOL was identified as a significant sign of infection in COVID-19 patients, mainly aged between 30 and 40 years, even in the absence of other symptoms. SOL was present as an initial symptom in 46.7% of subjects, and in 16.7%, it was the only symptom. Among the COVID-19 confirmed cases, SOL occurred as the only symptom in 19.2% of patients.

METHODS: Ten LT recipients diagnosed as having COVID-19 pneumonia in a 6-month period in our transplantation center were included. Demographic and medical data of the recipients were retrospectively collected; clinical courses, treatment responses, and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Ten LT recipients were male, had a median age of 57 years (min-max, 36-69 years; interquartile range [IQR], 13 years), and had right lobe from living donor LT performed in a median of 11 months (min-max, 1-72 months; IQR, 12 months). Five patients had severe pneumonia, and the remaining patients had mild/moderate pneumonia. The most frequent symptoms were fever (90%) and cough (70%). Favipiravir, enoxaparin sodium, and corticosteroid were initiated at the time of the diagnosis; immunosuppressive drug doses were reduced or discontinued in 3 cases. Lymphopenia median: 510/mL (min-max, 90-1400 mL; IQR, 610 mL), increased levels of C-reactive protein median: 4.72 (min-max, 0.31-23.4; IQR, 8.5), and ferritin median: 641 (min-max, 40 to &#8805; 1650; IQR, 1108) were frequent. Four patients required antibacterial treatments because of emerging bacterial pneumonia and/or sepsis. All patients were hospitalized for a median of 10 days. One patient with sepsis died on the 26th day after intensive care unit admission, and the remaining 9 survived. No further complication was recorded for 1-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Commencing favipiravir, enoxaparin sodium, and corticosteroid treatments; close follow-up of the developing complications; the temporary reduction or cessation of immunosuppression; a multidisciplinary approach; early awareness of the bacterial infections; and the initiation appropriate antibiotic treatments can contribute to success.","Kose, Adem; Toplu, Sibel Altunisik; Yalcinsoy, Murat; Yakupogullari, Yusuf; Otlu, Baris; Otan, Emrah; Aydin, Cemalettin; Yilmaz, Sezai; Bayindir, Yasar",Transplant. proc,,311

Genomic analyses have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is related to Pangolin and Bat coronaviruses. In this report, a structural comparison between the Sars-CoV-2 Envelope and Membrane proteins from different human isolates with homologous proteins from closely related viruses is described. The analyses here reported show the high structural similarity of Envelope and Membrane proteins to the counterparts from Pangolin and Bat coronavirus isolates. However, the comparisons have also highlighted structural differences specific of Sars-CoV-2 proteins which may be correlated to the cross-species transmission and/or to the properties of the virus.

The absence of reported absolute risk reduction in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials can lead to outcome reporting bias that affects the interpretation of vaccine efficacy. The present article uses clinical epidemiologic tools to critically appraise reports of efficacy in Pfzier/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccine clinical trials. Based on data reported by the manufacturer for Pfzier/BioNTech vaccine BNT162b2, this critical appraisal shows: relative risk reduction, 95.1%; 95% CI, 90.0% to 97.6%; p = 0.016; absolute risk reduction, 0.7%; 95% CI, 0.59% to 0.83%; p < 0.000. For the Moderna vaccine mRNA-1273, the appraisal shows: relative risk reduction, 94.1%; 95% CI, 89.1% to 96.8%; p = 0.004; absolute risk reduction, 1.1%; 95% CI, 0.97% to 1.32%; p < 0.000. Unreported absolute risk reduction measures of 0.7% and 1.1% for the Pfzier/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively, are very much lower than the reported relative risk reduction measures.

However, the mechanism behind liver injury, particularly in severe and critical COVID-19 patients, remains unclear and the clinical course is poorly described. Methods: We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study of consecutive hospitalized severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients with or without liver injury who underwent immunologic testing (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-&#945;, and IL-1ß). Liver injury was defined as peak aminotransferases &#8805;3x ULN (40 U/L) or &#8805;120 U/L. Patients with liver injury were compared to those who had normal aminotransferases throughout the hospital course. Results: 176 patients were studied; 109 with liver injury and 67 controls. Patients with liver injury were more likely to be male (71.6% vs 37.3%; p < 0.001). Peak inflammatory markers and IL-6 were higher in the liver injury group: CRP: 247 vs 168 mg/L, p < 0.001; LDH: 706 vs 421 U/L, ferritin: 2,973 vs 751 ng/mL, p < 0.001, IL-6: 121.0 vs 71.8, p < 0.001. There was no difference in the levels of IL-8, TNF-&#945;, and IL-1ß. The liver injury group had a longer length of stay and more severe COVID-19 despite having less diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Discussion: An exaggerated hyper inflammatory response (cytokine storm) characterized by significantly elevated CRP, LDH, ferritin, and IL-6 levels and increasing severity of COVID-19 appears to be associated with the occurrence of liver injury in patients with severe/ critical COVID-19.","Da, Ben L; Kushner, Tatyana; El Halabi, Maan; Paka, Pavan; Khalid, Mian; Uberoi, Angad; Lee, Brian T; Perumalswami, Ponni V; Rutledge, Stephanie M; Schiano, Thomas D; Friedman, Scott; Saberi, Behnam",,,311

361206,"The impact of frailty on epistaxis admission, a retrospective cohort study",2021,"PURPOSE: Shenfu decoction has outstanding curative effects in the treatment of COVID-19. This study aimed to explore the material basis and molecular mechanism of Shenfu Decoction through network pharmacology and molecular mechanisms, to provide a research basis for clinical medication and clues for subsequent research. METHODS: The active components and targets of Shenfu decoction were searched in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP), and the COVID-19-associated genes were collected using the Gene Cards platform. The target protein-protein interaction network map was constructed by mapping two genes, and the 'drug-active ingredient-target' network was constructed using Cytoscape software. The Gene Ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment of the mapping targets were analyzed. RESULT: Based on Traditional Chinese medicine, Shenfu Decoction can take effect in the lung, spleen, kidney and heart. Considering oral bioavailability (OB) &#8805; 30% and drug-like (DL) &#8805; 0.18 as the standard, 43 active compounds were screened and 114 Shenfu decoction action targets were collected. The key targets were CASP3, MAPK8, PTGS2, IL1B, PPARG, ICAM1, IFNG, RELA, NOS2, NOS3, HMOX1, CASP8, STAT1, and TGFB1. According to the standard of p < .05, GO function was enriched in 108 biological processes, 16 cell processes and 27 molecular processes. Sixty-three signaling pathways were enriched by KEGG, which can be divided into four types: viral infection pathways, signal pathways, biological process pathways and different disease pathways. The comparison of negative and positive prescriptions further reflects the positive effect of Shenfu decoction against COVID-19. Finally, the effective ingredients with the high degree were molecular docked with Mpro, Rdrp and Spro proteins to further confirm the intervention effect of Shenfu Decoction on COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Shenfu decoction played an important role in regulating the anti-virus process, regulating immunity, inhibiting inflammation and regulating apoptosis through the interrelated regulation mechanism of multi-components and multi-targets, to treat patients with severe COVID-19.","Li, Xiaoling; Lin, Haowen; Wang, Qu; Cui, Liao; Luo, Hui; Luo, Lianxiang",Drug Dev Ind Pharm,,311
362128,Incidence of Myocardial Injury in COVID-19-Infected Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted governments around the world to impose mitigation strategies of unprecedented scales, typically involving some form of restrictions on social activities and transportation. The South Korean government has been recommending a collection of guidelines now known as social distancing, leading to reduced human activities. This study analyzes changes in the concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) during the 30-day periods before and since the start of social distancing on 29 February 2020 using measurement data from air quality monitoring stations at various locations of the seven major cities of South Korea, namely, Seoul, Busan, Incheon, Daegu, Daejeon, Gwangju, and Ulsan. All seven cities experienced decreased levels of PM2.5 concentration by up to 25% and smaller fluctuations during the period of social distancing. Inter-city comparisons show that the PM2.5 concentration changes are positively correlated with the city-wide PM2.5 emission fractions for mobile sources and negatively correlated with the city-wide PM2.5 emission fractions for combustion and industrial process sources. In addition, the meteorological influences favorable for transboundary pollutant transport have weakened during the period under COVID-19 social distancing. Intra-city comparisons show that decreases in the intra-city variability of PM2.5 concentration were larger in coastal cities than in inland cities. Comparisons between the inter- and intra-city variabilities in the PM2.5 concentration changes under social distancing highlight the importance of taking into account intra-city variabilities in addition to inter-city variabilities.","Kwak, Kyung-Hwan; Han, Beom-Soon; Park, Kyeongjoo; Moon, Sungju; Jin, Han-Gyul; Park, Seung-Bu; Baik, Jong-Jin",Air Qual Atmos Health,,311

However, due to the range of factors influencing news agencies, such coverage may not always be impartial. Media bias, or slanted news coverage, can have a substantial impact on public perception of events, and, accordingly, can potentially alter the beliefs and views of the public. The main data gap in current research on media bias detection is a robust, representative, and diverse dataset containing annotations of biased words and sentences. In particular, existing datasets do not control for the individual background of annotators, which may affect their assessment and, thus, represents critical information for contextualizing their annotations. In this poster, we present a matrix-based methodology to crowdsource such data using a self-developed annotation platform. We also present MBIC (Media Bias Including Characteristics) - the first sample of 1,700 statements representing various media bias instances. The statements were reviewed by ten annotators each and contain labels for media bias identification both on the word and sentence level. MBIC is the first available dataset about media bias reporting detailed information on annotator characteristics and their individual background. The current dataset already significantly extends existing data in this domain providing unique and more reliable insights into the perception of bias. In future, we will further extend it both with respect to the number of articles and annotators per article.","Spinde, T.; Rudnitckaia, L.; Sinha, K.; Hamborg, F.; Gipp, B.; Donnay, K.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11910v1.pdf,311

Orthopaedic podcasts, a burgeoning e-learning platform, continue to gain traction; however, there is a paucity of information regarding their coverage of topics and their distribution over time. Therefore, our analysis sought to (1) characterize podcast content related to orthopaedic surgery, and (2) evaluate the changes in the prevalence of orthopaedic podcasts over the past 15 years. METHODS: Three common podcasting platforms (Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, and Spotify) were queried using the key terms ""orthopaedic,"" ""orthopedic,"" and ""ortho"" in order to identify a list of podcasts that are related to orthopaedic surgery. For each unique orthopaedic podcast, the title, the show description, the number of episodes, the date of the first episode, the date of the most recent episode, and episode frequency were collected. Podcasts were then classified based on a predetermined list of podcast domains. The number of existing active (released within the last 3 months) orthopaedic podcasts was then trended on a monthly basis from 2011 to 2020. RESULTS: Ninety-four unique podcasts met inclusion criteria, 62 of which remained active as of October 25, 2020. The most common podcast domains were ""general"" (38 [40.4%]) and ""clinical knowledge"" (20 [21.3%]). Among the assessed podcasts, 90 (95.7%) utilized an exclusively audio format. The majority of podcasts were based in the United States (89.4%), included introductory music (72.3%), and included interviews (63.8%). Most podcast hosts were practicing orthopaedic surgeons (52.1%). Between January 2016 and October 2020, the number of active orthopaedic surgery podcasts grew more than twelvefold (1,240%) at an average rate of roughly 1 new podcast each month (average, 1.0 podcast; standard deviation, 1.8). DISCUSSION: The past decade has seen sizable growth in the number of readily available podcasts related to orthopaedic surgery.

To address this, we developed a Luminex-based multiplex immunoassay that detects total antibodies (IgG/IgM/IgA) against the N, S1 and RBD antigens and used it to compare antibody responses in 1225 blood donors across Greece. Seroprevalence based on single-antigen readouts was strongly influenced by both the antigen type and cut-off value and ranged widely [0.8% (95% CI 0.4-1.5%)-7.5% (95% CI 6.0-8.9%)].

Although in silico docking studies, sequence-based computational studies, and experimental studies have shown the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in cats, ferrets, and other domestic/wild animals, the results are not conclusive of infection under natural conditions. Identifying the potential host range of SARS-CoV-2 will not only help prevent the possibility of human-to-animal and animal-to-human transmission but also assist in identifying efficient animal models that can mimic the clinical symptoms, transmission potential, and pathogenesis of the disease.

The 7-day adverse reactions occurred in 3 (12.5%), 5 (20.8%), 4 (16.7%), and 6 (25.0%) patients in the alum only, low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively, in the phase 1 trial; and in 5 (6.0%) and 4 (14.3%) patients who received injections on days 0 and 14 for vaccine and alum only, and 16 (19.0%) and 5 (17.9%) patients who received injections on days 0 and 21 for vaccine and alum only, respectively, in the phase 2 trial. The most common adverse reaction was injection site pain, followed by fever, which were mild and self-limiting; no serious adverse reactions were noted. The geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies in the low-, medium-, and high-dose groups at day 14 after 3 injections were 316 (95% CI, 218-457), 206 (95% CI, 123-343), and 297 (95% CI, 208-424), respectively, in the phase 1 trial, and were 121 (95% CI, 95-154) and 247 (95% CI, 176-345) at day 14 after 2 injections in participants receiving vaccine on days 0 and 14 and on days 0 and 21, respectively, in the phase 2 trial. There were no detectable antibody responses in all alum-only groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In this interim report of the phase 1 and phase 2 trials of an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine, patients had a low rate of adverse reactions and demonstrated immunogenicity; the study is ongoing. Efficacy and longer-term adverse event assessment will require phase 3 trials.

370935,Radiation Therapy Department Reorganization during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak: Keys to Securing Staff and Patients During the First Weeks of the Crisis and Impact on Radiation Therapy Practice from a Single Institution Experience,2020,"COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) is a severe respiratory syndrome currently causing a human global pandemic. The original virus, along with newer variants, is highly transmissible. Aerosol is a multiphase system consisting of the atmosphere with suspended solid and liquid particles, which can carry toxic and harmful substances; especially the liquid components. The degree to which aerosol can carry the virus and cause COVID-19 disease is of significant research importance. In this study, we have discussed the aerosol transmission as the pathway of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2), and the aerosol pollution reduction as a consequence of the COVID-19 lockdown. The aerosol transmission routes of the SARS-CoV-2 can be further subdivided into proximal human-exhaled aerosol transmission and potentially more distal ambient aerosol transmission. The human-exhaled aerosol transmission is a direct dispersion of the SARS-CoV-2. The ambient aerosol transmission is an indirect dispersion of the SARS-CoV-2 in which the aerosol act as a carrier to spread the virus. This indirect dispersion can also stimulate the up-regulation of the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE-2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) and protease TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane Serine Protease 2), thereby increasing the incidence and mortality of COVID-19. From the aerosol quality data around the world, it can be seen that often atmospheric pollution has significantly decreased due to factors such as the reduction of traffic, industry, cooking and coal-burning emissions during the COVID-19 lockdown. The airborne transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2, the infectivity of the virus in ambient aerosols, and the reduction of aerosol pollution levels due to the lockdowns are crucial research subjects.","Cao, Yaxin; Shao, Longyi; Jones, Tim; Oliveira, Marcos L S; Ge, Shuoyi; Feng, Xiaolei; Silva, Luis F O; BéruBé, Kelly",,,311
372042,Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Duration in Medically Managed Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients: Sub-Analysis of the OPT-CAD Study,2020,"Shedding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in the feces and urine of infected patients and subsequent presence in wastewater has produced interest on the use of this matrix for sentinel surveillance at a community level and as a complementary approach to syndromic surveillance. With this work, we set the foundations for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) in Portugal by monitoring the trends of SARS-CoV-2 RNA circulation in the community, on a nationwide perspective during different epidemiological phases of the pandemic. The Charite assays (E_Sarbecco, RdRP, and N_Sarbecco) were applied to monitor, over 32-weeks (April to December 2020), the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the inlet of five wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), which together serve more than two million people in Portugal. Raw wastewater from three COVID-19 reference hospitals was also analyzed during this period. In total, more than 600 samples were tested. Sampling started late April 2020, during lockdown, and, for the first weeks, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was sporadic, with concentrations varying from 103 to 105 genome copies per liter (GC/L). Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA increased steeply by the end of May into late June, mainly in Lisboa e Vale do Tejo region (LVT), during the reopening phase. After the summer, with the reopening of schools in mid-September and return to partial face-to-face work, a pronounced increase of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater was detected. In the LVT area, SARS-CoV-2 RNA load agreed with reported trends in hotspots of infection. Synchrony between trends of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw wastewater and daily new COVID-19 cases highlights the value of WBE as a surveillance tool for this virus, particularly after the phasing out of the epidemiological curve and when hotspots of disease re-emerge in the population which might be difficult to spot based solely on syndromic surveillance and contact tracing.","Monteiro, Silvia; Rente, Daniela; Cunha, Monica V.; Gomes, Manuel Carmo; Marques, Tiago; Lourenco, Artur; Cardoso, Eugenia; Alvaro, Pedro; Silva, Marco; Coelho, Norberta; Vilaca, Joao; Meireles, Fatima; Broco, Nuno; Carvalho, Marta; Santos, Ricardo",,,311

We show that the optimal information acquisition strategy proceeds in stages, where resource allocation is constant over a fixed set of providers during each stage, and at each stage a new provider is added to the set. We additionally apply this characterization to derive results regarding: (1) endogenous information acquisition in a binary choice problem, and (2) equilibrium information provision by competing news sources.","Liang, Annie; Mu, Xiaosheng; Syrgkanis, Vasilis",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07015v1.pdf,311

Methods: Articles were retrieved from a Pubmed search and additional snowballing was con-ducted to provide other relevant sources. Further utilizations were made of Campbell's modified framework of the Human Resources for Health (HRH) and Universal Health Coverage with the WHO labour market dynamics framework for Universal Health Coverage. Four sub-themes viz improved HRH performance, Labour Market Factors, Rural Health Workers Retention Factors, and Information Technology Factors were analysed. Results: Labour market factors such as the dynamics of demand and supply of health workers determine the availability of health workers. Supportive supervision enables the health workers to improve in their performance and enhance optimised utilisation of available resources. This supervision can be more effective by complementing it with tools such as information technology that focus on improving the quality of health care, considering the growth in the number of internet and broadband users in the continent. Conclusion: Expanding the training opportunities for health workers and also increasing the fund-ing to human resources for health are useful policy options to consider. Cost-effective approaches such as a focus on community health committees which stimulate the demand for health services in rural communities to tackle the disproportionate distribution of health workers should be con-sidered in the context of the uncertain economic aftermath of the covid-19 outbreak. © 2021 McKing et al;.","Amedari, M.

So, no one is safe until everyone is safe. Worldwide researchers are looking for the vaccine to remove the need for social distancing, mask-wearing and social gathering. A vaccine is like many other outcomes if the vaccine would be available; we cannot say about the effectiveness of the vaccine. Several drugs are testing to save the people life from pandemic; azithromycin is one of them. This work is a review article with the updated findings of azithromycin in the context of COVID-19. The option of azithromycin with regards to COVID-19 is justified by its anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anti-fibrotic effects and their pharmacokinetic properties, leading to effective concentrations in the target tissue. Azithromycin tends to be an effective candidate for SARS-CoV-2 replication inhibition that block the initial stage of the viral life cycle. Clinical trials at a preliminary scale and final stage show the significant results of azithromycin in supportive care therapy. Azithromycin was an early candidate for the medication of Covid-19 with or without hydroxychloroquine. It is exercised mostly as an outpatient antibiotic in COVID-19. In summing-up, any primary anti-viral and antibiotic treatment is not the only possibility of fighting COVID-19 pharmacologically. It will be an injustice with them who require broader spectrum antibiotic if we do not exercise azithromycin to them. So significant research priority is needed to determine whether azithromycin is useful in the treatment of COVID-19.","Wahab, Shadma; Ahmad, Md Faruque; Hussain, Arshad; Usmani, Shazia; Shoaib, Ambreen; Ahmad, Wasim",Mini-reviews in medicinal chemistry (Online),,311
375622,Continues renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with disposable hemoperfusion cartridge: A promising option for severe COVID-19,2020,"The Covid-19 pandemic is currently a major worldwide public health problem. Contagion within prisons and in other custodial settings will need to be addressed promptly, but the management of preventive measures will be difficult due to overcrowding and inmates and officers' close physical contact. There may also be less access to care than in community settings. Accordingly, prisons are particularly vulnerable to outbreaks of infection, and in addition to the likely greater risks of contagion attention must be paid to the psychological problems that the pandemic can have on the prison population. Riots and episodes of violence have already taken place in various prisons. With the inevitable restrictions on social contact and family meetings, prisoners who already are at increased risk of mental illness and suicide are more susceptible to adverse psychological repercussions. From a forensic point of view, therefore, we stress the need for the development of a strong support network by mental health workers for the prison population.","Caputo, Fiorella; Gratteri, Santo; Sacco, Matteo Antonio; Scalise, Carmen; Cacciatore, Giulia; Bonetta, Filippo; Zibetti, Angelica; Aloe, Luigi De; Sicilia, Francesco; Cordasco, Fabrizio; Ricci, Pietrantonio; Aquila, Isabella",Med Leg J,,311

In addition to the burden of psychosocial stress, there is increasing evidence of direct viral neuroinvasion of the central nervous system through physical contact with the nasal mucosa. In a parallel fashion, there is a significant body of ongoing research related to the risk of in utero viral transmission and the resulting neurodevelopmental impact in the fetus. Aberrant neurodevelopment secondary to viral transmission has previously been related to the later development of psychosis, schizophrenia, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders, generating the hypothesis that this population of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 may see an increased incidence in future decades. We discuss the current understanding of the possible neurotropism and vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and relate this to the history of viral pandemics to better understand the relationship of viral infection, aberrant immune response and neurodevelopment, and the risk for schizophrenia disorder.","Zimmer, Anna; Youngblood, Alix; Adnane, Adam; Miller, Brian J; Goldsmith, David R",Brain behav. immun,,311

METHODS: Five-hundred thirty-eight inpatients with mental disorders participated in a survey about psychological consequences of the pandemic between March-December 2020. We examined the perceived burden by restrictions and worries, changes in health care utilization, and helpfulness of coping strategies. RESULTS: More than 50% reported any worsening of symptoms, 40% stated increased need of therapeutic support. High rates of symptom deterioration were observed for depressive symptoms (>55%), anxiety (>40%), and sleeping behavior (>40%). Treatment impairment was stated by 27.9%. Patients with anxiety disorders were less affected by contact restrictions compared with eating disorders and depression. Patients with anorexia nervosa and post-traumatic stress disorder experienced higher helpfulness by daily structuring than patients with depression. DISCUSSION: About half of our sample of psychiatric patients experienced symptom deterioration due to the pandemic and about one quarter reported impairment of treatment modalities. Especially patients with eating disorders and depressive disorders were more frequently affected.

Currently, there is no specific treatment or vaccine to counter this highly contagious disease. There is an urgent need to find a specific cure for the disease and global efforts are directed at developing SARS-CoV-2 specific antivirals and immunomodulators. Ayurvedic Rasayana therapy has been traditionally used in India for its immunomodulatory and adaptogenic effects, and more recently has been included as therapeutic adjuvant for several maladies. Amongst several others, Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha), Tinospora cordifolia (Guduchi) and Asparagus racemosus (Shatavari) play an important role in Rasayana therapy. The objective of this study was to explore the immunomodulatory and anti SARS-CoV2 potential of phytoconstituents from Ashwagandha, Guduchi and Shatavari using network pharmacology and docking. The plant extracts were prepared as per ayurvedic procedures and a total of 31 phytoconstituents were identified using UHPLC-PDA and mass spectrometry studies. To assess the immunomodulatory potential of these phytoconstituents an in-silico network pharmacology model was constructed. The model predicts that the phytoconstituents possess the potential to modulate several targets in immune pathways potentially providing a protective role. To explore if these phytoconstituents also possess antiviral activity, docking was performed with the Spike protein, Main Protease and RNA dependent RNA polymerase of the virus. Interestingly, several phytoconstituents are predicted to possess good affinity for the three targets, suggesting their application for the termination of viral life cycle. Further, predictive tools indicate that there would not be adverse herb-drug pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interactions with concomitantly administered drug therapy. We thus make a compelling case to evaluate the potential of these Rasayana botanicals as therapeutic adjuvants in the management of COVID-19 following rigorous experimental validation.","Borse, Swapnil; Joshi, Manali; Saggam, Akash; Bhat, Vedika; Walia, Safal; Marathe, Aniket; Sagar, Sneha; Chavan-Gautam, Preeti; Girme, Aboli; Hingorani, Lal; Tillu, Girish",PLoS One,,311

381035,A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Risk Factors Associated with Severity and Death in COVID-19 Patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: Early identification of patients with COVID-19 who may develop critical illness is of great importance. METHODS: In this study a retrospective cohort of 264 COVID-19 cases admitted at Macarena University was used for development and internal validation of a risk score to predict the occurrence of critical illness in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Backward stepwise logistic regression was used to derive the model, including clinical and laboratory variables predictive of critical illness. Internal validation of the final model used bootstrapped samples and the model scoring derived from the coefficients. External validation was performed in a cohort of 154 cases admitted at Valme and Virgen del Rocio University Hospital. RESULTS: A total of 62 (23.5%) patients developed a critical illness during their hospitalization stay, 21 (8.0%) patients needed invasive ventilation, 34 (12.9%) were admitted at the ICU and the overall mortality was of 14.8% (39 cases). 5 variables were included in the final model: age >59.5 years (OR: 3.11;95%CI 1.39-6.97), abnormal CRP results (OR: 5.76;95%CI 2.32-14.30), abnormal lymphocytes count (OR: 3.252;95%CI 1.56-6.77), abnormal CK results (OR: 3.38;95%CI 1.59-7.20) and abnormal creatinine (OR: 3.30;95%CI 1.42-7.68).

The clinical data of COVID-19 patients from December 2019 to February 2020 were retrieved from four databases. We statistically analyzed the clinical symptoms and laboratory results of COVID-19 patients and explained the discharge rate and fatality rate with a single-arm meta-analysis. The available data of 1994 patients in 10 literatures were included in our study. The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients were fever (88.5%), cough (68.6%), myalgia or fatigue (35.8%), expectoration (28.2%), and dyspnea (21.9%). Minor symptoms include headache or dizziness (12.1%), diarrhea (4.8%), nausea and vomiting (3.9%). The results of the laboratory showed that the lymphocytopenia (64.5%), increase of C-reactive protein (44.3%), increase of lactic dehydrogenase (28.3%), and leukocytopenia (29.4%) were more common. The results of single-arm meta-analysis showed that the male took a larger percentage in the gender distribution of COVID-19 patients 60% (95% CI [0.54, 0.65]), the discharge rate of COVID-19 patients was 52% (95% CI [0.34,0.70]), and the fatality rate was 5% (95% CI [0.01,0.11]).","Li, Long-Quan; Huang, Tian; Wang, Yong-Qing; Wang, Zheng-Ping; Liang, Yuan; Huang, Tao-Bi; Zhang, Hui-Yun; Sun, Weiming; Wang, Yuping",J Med Virol,,311

This was an open-label, randomised clinical trial of ICU patients with life-threatening COVID-19 (positive RT-qPCR plus ARDS, sepsis, organ failure, hyperinflammation). Study was terminated after 87/120 patients enrolled. Standard treatment plus TPE (n = 43) versus standard treatment (n = 44), and stratified by PaO2/FiO2 ratio (>150 vs. &#8804;150), were compared. Primary outcomes were 35-day mortality and TPE safety. Secondary outcomes were association between TPE and mortality, improvement in SOFA score, change in inflammatory biomarkers, days on mechanical ventilation (MV), and ICU length of stay (LOS). Eighty-seven patients [median age 49 (IQR 34-63) years; 82.8% male] were randomised (44 standard care; 43 standard care plus TPE). Days on MV (P = 0.007) and ICU LOS (P = 0.02) were lower in the TPE group. 35-Day mortality was non-significantly lower in the TPE group (20.9% vs. 34.1%; Kaplan-Meier, P = 0.582). TPE was associated with increased lymphocytes and ADAMTS-13 activity and decreased serum lactate, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, d-dimers and interleukin-6. Multivariable regression analysis provided several predictors of 35-day mortality: PaO2/FiO2 ratio (HR, 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-1.00; P = 0.02]; ADAMTS-13 activity (HR, 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.98; P = 0.01); pulmonary embolism (HR, 3.57, 95% CI 1.43-8.92; P = 0.007). Post-hoc analysis revealed a significant reduction in SOFA score for TPE patients (P < 0.05).

A droplet easily rolls off the surface of the wings along the radial outward (RO) direction of the central axis of the body, but is pinned tightly against the RO direction. Interestingly, these two distinct states can be tuned by controlling the posture of the wings (downward or upward) and the direction of airflow across the surface (along or against the RO direction), respectively. Research indicated that these special abilities resulted from the direction-dependent arrangement of nano-tips on ridging nano-stripes and micro-scales overlapped on the wings at the level, where two distinct contact modes of a droplet with orientation-tuneable microstructures occur and thus produce different adhesive forces. We believe that this finding will help the design of smart, fluid-controllable interfaces that may be applied in novel microfluidic devices and directional, easy-cleaning coatings.","Zheng, Yongmei; Gao, Xuefeng; Jiang, Lei",Soft Matter,,311

Design/methodology/approach It is a case study of the changes made to content, teaching methods and assessment in a postgraduate introductory financial accounting course of approximately 350 students across two terms. Findings The key findings are that the sudden change from face-to-face to online teaching to address government regulations, social distancing expectations and students' needs required immediate changes to how content was delivered, how to interact with students (many of who were studying outside of Australia), and how to adapt to online assessments. Many of the innovations the authors describe will continue to be used in the course going forward both in face-to-face and online formats. That is, the need to change resulted in innovations that can be implemented in a post-pandemic environment.

We investigated the relationship of past-year medical and non-medical use of z-drugs with past-year: i) psychological distress; ii) medical use, non-medical use, and DSM-IV use disorder of Benzodiazepine (BZD) tranquilizers; iii) use and DSM-IV alcohol and marijuana use disorders, recreational drugs with a depressant effect on the central nervous system. METHODS: Data came from the 2015-2017 NSDUH (n = 128,740). Participants aged 18+ were asked if they had used any Z-Drug medically or non-medically in the past year. We investigated the associations between the three-level z-drugs variable with psychological distress and BZD, alcohol, and marijuana variables in multinomial logistic regression models. RESULTS: Past-year prevalences of z-drug use were 3.3% for medical and 0.5% for non-medical use. Medical and non-medical users of z-drugs had higher risk of psychological distress, compared to non-users. Medical and non-medical users of z-drugs had higher risk of medical use, non-medical use, and BZD use disorders. Compared to non-users of z-drugs, medical users had higher risk of marijuana and alcohol use and alcohol use disorders, while non-medical users had higher risk of marijuana use and marijuana use disorders and alcohol. CONCLUSION: Z-drug users have elevated risk of use and dependence of BZDs and recreational drugs, possibly due to concurrent prescribing and self-medication.","Tardelli, V S; Fidalgo, T M; Martins, S S",Addict Behav,,311

METHODS: Rapid lateral flow tests and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) that detect Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were carried out using 1150 stored human serum samples that had been collected in 2018 and 2019. The tests were also run using samples from 15 control patients who had positive or negative oral swab test results, as assessed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). The urea dissociation test was employed to rule out false-positive reactivity in the two antibody detection methods. RESULTS: The lateral flow tests revealed 21 positive samples from the stored sera: 12 for IgM, four for IgG, and five for IgM/IgG. Among the nine rRT-PCR- positive controls, six individuals presented IgG and three IgM/IgG positivity. Using the urea (6 mol/L) dissociation test, two of the twelve stored samples that had shown IgM positivity were confirmed to be positive. The ELISA test detected four IgM-positive and three IgG-positive specimens. After treatment with 4 mol/L urea, the IgM-positive samples became negative, whereas the IgG positivity persisted. All of the rRT-PCR-positive controls were found to retain IgM or IgG positivity following the urea treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the limited utility of serological testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus based on the results of specimens collected before the outbreak of the infection.","Latiano, Anna; Tavano, Francesca; Panza, Anna; Palmieri, Orazio; Niro, Grazia A; Andriulli, Nicola; Latiano, Tiziana; Corritore, Giuseppe; Gioffreda, Domenica; Gentile, Annamaria; Fontana, Rosanna; Guerra, Maria; Biscaglia, Giuseppe; Bossa, Fabrizio; Carella, Massimo; Miscio, Giuseppe; di Mauro, Lazzaro",Int J Infect Dis,,311

However, accurate and reliable screening of patients is a massive challenge due to the discrepancy between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia in X-ray images. In this paper, we design a new stacked convolutional neural network model for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 disease from the chest X-ray images. We obtain different sub-models from the VGG19 and developed a 30-layered CNN model (named as CovNet30) during the training, and obtained sub-models are stacked together using logistic regression. The proposed CNN model combines the discriminating power of the different CNN`s sub-models and classifies chest X-ray images into COVID-19, Normal, and Pneumonia classes. In addition, we generate X-ray images dataset referred to as COVID19CXr, which includes 2764 chest x-ray images of 1768 patients from the three publicly available data repositories. The proposed stacked CNN achieves an accuracy of 92.74%, the sensitivity of 93.33%, PPV of 92.13%, and F1-score of 0.93 for the classification of X-ray images. Our proposed approach shows its superiority over the existing methods for the diagnosis of the COVID-19 from the X-ray images.","Gour, Mahesh; Jain, Sweta",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13817v1.pdf,311

However, the in vivo effect of HCQ still unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate viral load clearance in patients with COVID-19 who underwent HCQ treatment in comparison with a control group that did not receive the drug. STUDY DESIGN: This prospective study comprised consecutive viral load measurements in patients with COVID-19 hospitalized with a moderate illness. Patients received 400 mg of HCQ every 12 h for 10 days according to the medical decision. Nasal swab samples were collected from patients during early, intermediary, and final clinical stage of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 155 samples were collected from 66 patients with COVID-19 (60% female), with a median age of 58 years. The viral load between studied groups, assumed as a semiquantitative measure of cycle threshold (Ct) values, presented no significant difference within the three consecutive measures (&#916;Ct) (p > 0.05).

As two important means of examination, computed tomography (CT) and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have always been controversial in the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Here, we report a family cluster case of a father and a son diagnosed as COVID-19 at our hospital, and described the clinical manifestations, laboratory results, CT changes, diagnosis and treatment strategy of these two patients. Focus on the value of these two methods in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, as well as their respective deficiencies. For patient 1 (father), the efficacy of RT-PCR is not satisfactory either in terms of diagnosis or follow-up, which may cause misdiagnosis and delay treatment. For patient 2 (son), the clinical symptoms were not obvious, but CT imaging clearly displayed dynamic changes of the lung lesions. Meanwhile, the two patients respectively underwent five chest CT examinations during their hospitalization and discharge follow-up, showing the potential harm of radiation. Therefore, in clinical work, doctors should make full use of the advantages of CT and RT-PCR, and take other measures to make up for their disadvantages.","Tang, Lei; Ye, Zheng; Huang, Zixing; Zeng, Xianchun; Wang, Tao; Xu, Rui; Wang, Rongpin; Song, Bin",Ann. palliat. med.

Methods: Single-centre experience with 32 pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 5 to April 5, 2020 at Madrid, Spain. Findings: COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed in 61.5% (32/52) women. Only 18.7% (6/32) had some underlying condition (mostly asthma). Supplemental oxygen therapy was required in 18 patients (56.3%), with high-flow requirements in six (18.7%). Eight patients (25.0%) fulfilled the criteria for acute distress respiratory syndrome. Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in two patients (6.2%). Tocilizumab was administered in five patients (15.6%). Delivery was precipitated due to COVID-19 in three women (9.4%). All the newborns had a favourable outcome, with no cases of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Severe cases of pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen were more likely to exhibit bilateral alveolar or interstitial infiltrates on chest X-ray (55.6% vs. 0.0%;P-value = 0.003) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels &gt;10 mg/dL (33.0% vs. 0.0%;P-value = 0.05) at admission than those with no oxygen requirements. Interpretation: Pregnant women with COVID-19 have a high risk of developing pneumonia, with a severe course in more than half of cases.

Trolling narratives form on Twitter as alternative explanations of polarizing events like the 2020 U.S. elections with the goal to conduct information operations or provoke emotional response. Detecting trolling narratives thus is an imperative step to preserve constructive discourse on Twitter and remove an influx of misinformation. Using existing techniques, this takes time and a wealth of data, which, in a rapidly changing election cycle with high stakes, might not be available. To overcome this limitation, we developed TrollHunter2020 to hunt for trolls in real-time with several dozens of trending Twitter topics and hashtags corresponding to the candidates' debates, the election night, and the election aftermath. TrollHunter2020 collects trending data and utilizes a correspondence analysis to detect meaningful relationships between the top nouns and verbs used in constructing trolling narratives while they emerge on Twitter. Our results suggest that the TrollHunter2020 indeed captures the emerging trolling narratives in a very early stage of an unfolding polarizing event.

Post declaration, India announced lockdown and various guidelines were issued by Health authorities worldwide for the organizations to function in this emergency aeon. Different organizations strategized differently to respond to COVID 19 pandemic. The aim was to implement COVID 19 guidelines across all the centres of a chain of Eye hospitals in India in short span of time overcoming the challenges. Methods: A SMART strategy was confabulated within the team. There were numerous challenges like lack of time, rapidly changing guidelines, no travelling scenarios, training and educating the staff in huge numbers, rapidly evolving situation, change management, need of increased vigilance, and language barrier at certain centres, sustaining quality assurance and motivating the staff in stressful times. The challenges were surpassed using a power packed strategy, dedicated efforts and team work grasping the available tools and technology from a single location. This template can serve us and other hospitals to respond in a better way for similar future challenges. Results: The COVID 19 protocols were implemented across all the centres successfully. The entire Quality assurance system drifted to online platform and education and awareness methods took the digital thread. Teamwork synergized with the aforementioned things and we came out with flying colours achieving the goals in short span of time overcoming all the barriers. Conclusion: Difficult times bring challenges and challenges teach us the innovative ways to convert them into opportunities. A well planned strategy, best utilization of available resources, team work and continuous monitoring can bring the best outcomes forward.","Singh, Mandeep J; Verma, Deepika; Banerjee, Tirtha B; Singh, Ankita; Bhatt, Kanika",Indian J Ophthalmol,,311

413421,Effect of Early Central Venous Catheterization On Mortality Among Patients with Severe Sepsis: A Nationwide Inpatient Database Study,2020,"Increasing evidence links personality to prosocial behaviour. HEXACO Honesty-Humility, in particular, has been linked to prosocial behaviour when it comes with a personal cost. Yet, evidence for such a link is mostly limited to the laboratory, although social dilemmas abound in daily life. Emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic pose salient conflicts of interests between individual and societal welfare. One example is the run on many basic goods in anticipation of lockdowns. Such social dilemmas afford the expression of personality traits associated with individual differences in prosocial behaviour. Indeed, across two studies (N = 601), Honesty-Humility was positively, albeit weakly associated with refraining from stockpiling in the past and intentions to do so in the future. Causal mediation analysis shows that this was not due to differences in beliefs that others would refrain from stockpiling. Instead, results suggest that faced with a social dilemma, individuals high in Honesty-Humility may have been willing to forego individual benefit. This provides rare evidence on the relationship between Honesty-Humility and prosocial behaviour in a field setting. © This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY-4.0).

413601,Cardiovascular Considerations of Experimental Hydroxychloroquine Therapy on Patients Diagnosed With COVID-19: A Case Series Review,2020,"We review some fundamental concepts of investment from a mathematical perspective, concentrating specifically on fractional-Kelly portfolios, which allocate a fraction of wealth to a growth-optimal portfolio while the remainder collects (or pays) interest at a risk-free rate. We elucidate a coherent continuous-parameter time-series framework for analysis of these portfolios, explaining relationships between Sharpe ratios, growth rates, and leverage. We see how Kelly's criterion prescribes the same leverage as Markowitz mean-variance optimization. Furthermore, for fractional Kelly portfolios, we state a simple distributional relationship between portfolio Sharpe ratio, the fractional coefficient, and portfolio log-returns. These results provide critical insight into realistic expectations of growth for different classes of investors, from individuals to quantitative trading operations. We then illustrate application of the results by analyzing performance of various bond and equity mixes for an investor. We also demonstrate how the relationships can be exploited by a simple method-of-moments calculation to estimate portfolio Sharpe ratios and levels of risk deployment, given a fund's reported returns.","Brockwell, Anthony E.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10814v1.pdf,311

414410,Microcirculation alterations in severe COVID-19 pneumonia,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically influenced the delivery of healthcare. In line with the UK Royal Colleges' advice the management of acute appendicitis (AA) changed with greater consideration for non-operative management (NOM) or open appendicectomy when operative management (OM) was sought. We describe our experience of the presentation, management and outcomes for these patients to inform care for future viral pandemics. METHODS: This retrospective, cohort study compared patients diagnosed with AA between March and July 2019 with those during the pandemic period of March to July 2020. Medical records were reviewed to obtain demographics, inflammatory markers, imaging, severity, management, histology, length of stay (LOS) and 90-day outcomes. RESULTS: There were 149 and 125 patients in the 2019 and 2020 cohorts respectively. 14 patients (9.4%) had NOM in 2019 versus 31 (24.8%) in 2020 (p = 0.001). In the 2019 operative management (OM) group 125 patients (92.6%) had laparoscopic appendicectomy versus 65 (69.1%) in 2020. 59 patients (39.6%) had a CT in 2019 versus 70 (56%) in 2020. The median LOS was 4 days in 2019 and 3 days in 2020 (p = 0.03). Two patients in each year who received NOM had treatment failure (14.3% in 2019 and 6.5% in 2020). Three patients in 2019 who received OM had treatment failure (2.2%). Of 95 patients tested for COVID-19 all but one tested negative. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic there was no observed increase in severity of AA, patients had a shorter LOS and were more likely to have imaging. NOM proportionally increased with no observed change in outcomes.","Pringle, Heather C M; Donigiewicz, Urszula; Bennett, Melissa-Rose; Walker, Eleanor; Fowler, George E; Narang, Sunil; Ball, Susan; Bethune, Robert M",BMC Surg,,311

As far as we know, the effect of isotretinoin on COVID-19 has not been studied before. AIM: We aimed to evaluate whether patients receiving oral isotretinoin are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection by comparing them with patients on topical treatment for acne vulgaris. METHODS: The data were collected retrospectively from a cohort of 267 acne vulgaris patients, who were under follow-up for acne vulgaris treatment during the pandemic period. RESULTS: Total of 227 patients (141 receiving isotretinoin treatment and 86 receiving topical treatment) were included of whom 29 patients had COVID-19 infection during acne vulgaris treatment. Fifteen (10.6%) patients were receiving oral isotretinoin and 14 (16.3%) were receiving topical acne treatment at the time of COVID-19 infection. The mean cumulative dose was 2340 ± 1988 mg at the time of COVID-19 infection. The mean elapsed time between the onset of isotretinoin treatment and positive PCR result for COVID-19 was 13.3 ± 10.3 weeks. Nine patients (64.3%) receiving isotretinoin treatment and 9 patients (60%) under topical treatment had loss of taste and smell during COVID-19 infection. Isotretinoin treatment was not found to be associated with a significant increased risk of getting COVID-19 (odds ratio, 0.671; 95% confidence interval, 0.247-1.823; P = 0.434). CONCLUSION: As a conclusion, the results of this study encourage dermatologists and acne vulgaris patients to initiate oral isotretinoin treatment safely during the pandemic period.","Demirel Ögüt, Neslihan; Kutlu, Ömer; Erbagci, Ece",J Cosmet Dermatol,,311
414852,"COVID-19 associated atrial fibrillation: Incidence, putative mechanisms and potential clinical implications",2020,"Cellular and humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is critical to control primary infection and correlates with severity of disease. The role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity, its relationship to antibodies, and pre-existing immunity against endemic coronaviruses (huCoV), which has been hypothesized to be protective, were investigated in 82 healthy donors (HDs), 204 recovered (RCs), and 92 active COVID-19 patients (ACs). ACs had high amounts of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike IgG but lymphopenia and overall reduced antiviral T cell responses due to the inflammatory milieu, expression of inhibitory molecules (PD-1, Tim-3) as well as effector caspase-3, -7, and -8 activity in T cells. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity conferred by polyfunctional, mainly interferon-Î³-secreting CD4+ T cells remained stable throughout convalescence, whereas humoral responses declined. Immune responses toward huCoV in RCs with mild disease and strong cellular SARS-CoV-2 T cell reactivity imply a protective role of pre-existing immunity against huCoV.","Bonifacius, Agnes; Tischer-Zimmermann, Sabine; Dragon, Anna C; Gussarow, Daniel; Vogel, Alexander; Krettek, Ulrike; Gödecke, Nina; Yilmaz, Mustafa; Kraft, Anke R M; Hoeper, Marius M; Pink, Isabell; Schmidt, Julius J; Li, Yang; Welte, Tobias; Maecker-Kolhoff, Britta; Martens, Jörg; Berger, Marc Moritz; Lobenwein, Corinna; Stankov, Metodi V; Cornberg, Markus; David, Sascha; Behrens, Georg M N; Witzke, Oliver; Blasczyk, Rainer; Eiz-Vesper, Britta",Immunity,,311

We investigated the need for endoscopic procedures, their findings, and impact on patient care in a systematic and geographically diverse sample of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: As part of the North American Alliance for the Study of Digestive Manifestations of COVID-19, we identified consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at 36 medical centers in the USA and Canada. We performed a secondary analysis of patients who underwent endoscopy, collecting information on endoscopic indications, findings, interventions, staffing, procedure location, anesthesia utilization, and adverse events. RESULTS: Data were collected on 1992 patients; 24 (1.2%) underwent 27 endoscopic procedures (18 upper endoscopies, 7 colonoscopies, 2 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies). The most common indications were: gastrointestinal bleeding (13) and enteral access (6). The most common findings were erosive or inflammatory changes. Ten patients underwent an endoscopic intervention for hemostatic therapy (2), enteral access (6), or biliary obstruction (2). Half of cases employed anesthesiology support; no sedation-related adverse events were reported. One-third of cases were performed in the intensive care setting and one quarter in the endoscopy unit. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, systematic, geographically diverse cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in North America, very few patients underwent endoscopy despite a high prevalence of gastrointestinal manifestations. Almost all endoscopic findings and interventions were thought related to critical illness rather than direct viral injury.

416305,Effect of micronutrient supplements on influenza and other respiratory tract infections among adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"Extensive work has been carried out on gender and social transformation but there is a need for more work between these intersecting trajectories and their implications for Christian mission. Drawing on data collected from one of the migrants this current study employs the postcolonial lens to analyse interview responses on a migration experience of a young female migrant in South Africa and highlights survival strategies for young migrants by demonstrating that the impact of changing global socio-economic landscapes and poverty on migrant communities presents opportunity to explore alternative missional paradigms and theologies that address conditions of deprivation. As a contribution to United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals, this study also highlights how some migrant women use situations of deprivation to promote socio-economic transformation through radical doctrines of resistance. Interrogating key themes that emerged from the interview (2) alongside Dolores William’s doctrines of resistance demonstrates how one adolescent migrant embodies the radical doctrine of hope as lived reality expressed through a resilient theology of survival, which is sustained by developing and adapting to new lifestyles through cultural capital, skills, competency, new personal qualities, fashion and language or accents as means for survival strategies in the face of hostility. Contribution: By reflecting on the complex and gendered survival strategies for migrant women in religious communities, this article represents a systematic and practical reflection within a paradigm in which the intersection of Philosophy, Religious Studies, Social Sciences, Humanities and Natural Sciences generates an interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and trans disciplinary contested discourse.","Mpofu, Buhle",Hervormde Teologiese Studies,,311
416398,Hypoxia response and acute lung and kidney injury: possible implications for therapy of COVID-19,2020,"A variety of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in China in December 2019. A new virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Within a few days, COVID-19 became a pandemic disease. This review aimed to investigate the possible implications of COVID-19 for human reproductive systems, as in previous studies ACE2 was highly expressed in some organs of these systems, such as the testicles. A total of 41 publications were found in the specialized databases and, after selection, 7 articles were used to build this study. Our results showed that the fever caused by COVID-19 has a negative effect on spermatogenesis, there is high expression of ACE2 in the testicles and in the uterine tubes and there is a higher level of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which is also responsible for the entry of the virus into the cell. Moreover, it was noted that there was viral genetic material in the semen and an increase in the serum concentration of luteinizing hormone (LH) in men and women, which could cause hypogonadism. Thus, we conclude that there is the possibility of infection and malfunction in the reproductive organs as well as the plausibility of sexual transmission of this disease. Further analysis must be carried out to prove the effects of COVID-19 on the human reproductive systems.","Carneiro Gomes, Paulo Roberto; Rodrigues da Rocha, Maria Debora; da Rocha Coelho, Francisco Alex; Sousa Pinho de Lira, John Arlley; de Sousa Carmo, Rubens Renato; Silva Nascimento, Hélio Mateus; Marques de Oliveira, Samara; Rodrigues da Silva, Wesley; Galdino Medeiros, Rebeca; Pereira Alves, Even Herlany; Dos Santos Carvalho, André; Pereira Vasconcelos, Daniel Fernando",Wien. klin.

Large gatherings play a key role, potentially favoring superspreading events. However, the effects of tracing in large groups have not been fully assessed so far. We show that beside forward tracing, which reconstructs to whom disease spreads, and backward tracing, which searches from whom disease spreads, a third""sideward""tracing is at work in large gatherings. This is an indirect tracing that detects infected asymptomatic individuals, even if they have neither been directly infected by, nor directly transmitted the infection to the index case. We analyze this effect in a model of epidemic spreading for SARS-CoV-2, within the framework of simplicial activity-driven temporal networks. We determine the contribution of the three tracing mechanisms to the suppression of epidemic spreading, unveiling the importance of sideward tracing and suggesting optimal strategies. We show the practical relevance of our results on an empirical dataset of gatherings in a University Campus.","Mancastroppa, Marco; Guizzo, Andrea; Castellano, Claudio; Vezzani, Alessandro; Burioni, Raffaella",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04742v1.pdf,311

However, the incidence of AKI in COVID-19 varies among studies. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the pooled incidence of AKI and its association with mortality in patients with COVID-19 using a meta-analysis. We search Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for eligible publications reporting the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 without language restriction. Incidence of AKI and mortality were reported. Meta-regression was used to describe the association between outcomes. From 26 studies (n=5497), the pooled incidence of AKI in patients with COVID-19 was 8.4% (95% CI 6.0% to 11.7%) with a pooled incidence of renal replacement therapy of 3.6% (95% CI 1.8% to 7.1%). The incidence of AKI was higher in critically ill patients (19.9%) compared with hospitalized patients (7.3%). The pooled estimated odds ratio for mortality from AKI was 13.33 (95% CI 4.05 to 43.91). No potential publication bias was detected. By using meta-regression analyses, the incidence of AKI was positively associated with mortality after adjusted for age and sex (Q=26.18; p=0.02). Moreover, age (p<0.01), diabetes (p=0.02), hypertension (p<0.01) and baseline serum creatinine levels (p=0.04) were positively associated with AKI incidence in adjusted models. In conclusion, AKI is present in 8.3% of overall patients with COVID-19 and in 19.9% of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Presence of AKI is associated with 13-fold increased risk of mortality. Age, diabetes, hypertension, and baseline serum creatinine levels are associated with increased AKI incidence.","Hansrivijit, Panupong; Qian, Chenchen; Boonpheng, Boonphiphop; Thongprayoon, Charat; Vallabhajosyula, Saraschandra; Cheungpasitporn, Wisit; Ghahramani, Nasrollah",J Investig Med,,311

Of these biological functions deterioration; there is a significant decline in the heart function, impairments in the lungs gas exchange, and impairments in the immune function. Many alterations in the body humeral and cellular immune response were observed with ageing process: The circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines are increased, the naive lymphocytes are decreased, the numbers of the antigen-presenting cells areelevated and the overall response is impaired. In addition, ageing is associated with a progressive restriction in the telomere length. Telomeres are located at chromosomes ends and play an essential role in preserving chromosome stability. Also, telomere length is very important to the immune system, because of the high sensitivity of the immune cells to the shortening of telomeres. Telomeres shortening adversely affect the immune cells' function and developments. These adverse changes increased the susceptibility for severe infection, risk of hospitalization, and even death. Elderly COVID-19 patients are at a real risk of complications due to impaired immune function, cytokine storm and defective respiratory function. Administration of anti-ageing immunomodulation factors like Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide NAD+ can minimize these changes through its potent immunomodulation and longevity effects. NAD+ has a direct inhibitory effect on PARP-1 and can prevent pro-inflammatory cytokines over-activation. Increasing the NAD+ level will also result in stabilizing telomeres and this has a positive impact on immune cells function.","Omran, Huda M; Almaliki, Mohamed S",J Infect Public Health,,311

Herein, we employ immunoinformatic tools to identify B-cell, T-cell epitopes associated with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is important for genome release. The results showed that the highly immunogenic epitopes located at the stalk part are mostly conserved compared to the receptor binding domain (RDB). Further, two vaccine candidates were computationally modeled from the linear B-cell, T-cell epitopes. Molecular docking reveals the crucial interactions of the vaccines with immune-receptors, and their stability is assessed by MD simulation studies. The chimeric vaccines showed remarkable binding affinity toward the immune cell receptors computed by the MM/PBSA method. van der Waals and electrostatic interactions are found to be the dominant factors for the stability of the complexes.

METHODS: A total of 132 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan, China from January 18, 2020 to February 26, 2020 were collected. The dynamic changes of blood SAA, CRP, PCT, WBC, Lymphocyte (L), PLT, CT imaging, and disease progression were studied. All patients completed at least twice laboratory data collection and clinical condition assessment at three time points indicated for this study; The length of hospital stay was longer than 14 days prior to February 26, 2020. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients had significantly increased SAA and CRP levels, while L count decreased, and PCT, WBC, and PLT were in the normal range. As disease progressed from mild to critically severe, SAA and CRP gradually increased, while L decreased, and PLT, WBC, and PCT had no significant changes; ROC curve analysis suggests that SAA/L, CRP, SAA, and L count are valuable in evaluating the severity of COVID-19 and distinguishing critically ill patients from mild ones; Patients with SAA consistently trending down during the course of disease have better prognosis, compared with the patients with SAA continuously rising; The initial SAA level is positively correlated with the dynamic changes of the serial CT scans. Patient with higher initial SAA level are more likely to have poor CT imaging. CONCLUSIONS: SAA and L are sensitive indicators in evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. Monitoring dynamic changes of SAA, combined with CT imaging could be valuable in diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.","Li, Huan; Xiang, Xiaochen; Ren, Hongwei; Xu, Lingli; Zhao, Lisha; Chen, Xiaoqiong; Long, Hui; Wang, Qiang; Wu, Qingming",J Infect,,311

This variety of agents is currently the cause of severe respiratory diseases (SARS-CoV2 and Influenza), Hepatitis C, measles and of high prevalence tropical diseases that are detected throughout the year (Dengue and Zika). The rs10774671 polymorphism is a base change from G to A in the last nucleotide of intron-5 of the OAS1 gene. This change modifies a splicing site and generates isoforms of the OAS1 protein with a higher molecular weight and a demonstrated lower enzymatic activity. The low activity of these OAS1 isoforms makes the innate immune response against RNA virus infections less efficient, representing a previously unattended risk factor for certain populations. Objective: Determine the distribution of rs10774671 in the open population of Mexico. Methods: In 98 healthy volunteers, allelic and genotypic frequencies were determined by qPCR using allele specific labeled probes, and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was determined. Results: The A-allele turned out to be the most prevalent in the analyzed population. Conclusions: Our population is genetically susceptible to RNA virus disease due to the pre-dominant presence of the A allele of rs10774671 in the OAS1 gene.","Sánchez-González, M.

This is done by evaluating a video feed obtained by a surveillance camera. The video is calibrated into bird’s view and fed as an input to the YOLOv3 model which is an already trained object detection model. The YOLOv3 model is trained using the Common Object in Context (COCO). The proposed system was corroborated on a pre-filmed video. The results and outcomes obtained by the system show that evaluation of the distance between multiple individuals and determining if rules are violated or not.

Furthermore, RNA sequencing transcriptome of skin biopsy samples and high-throughput multiplexed proteomic profiling of serum were performed. RESULTS: IMC revealed by clustering analyses a more prominent, phenotypically shifted cytotoxic CD8+ T cell population and highly activated monocyte/macrophage (Mo/Mac) clusters in COVID-MDR. The RNA sequencing transcriptome demonstrated a more robust cytotoxic response in COVID-MDR skin. However, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was not detected in skin biopsies at the time point of MDR diagnosis. Serum proteomic profiling of COVID-MDR patients revealed upregulation of various inflammatory mediators (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, TNF, and IFN-Î³), eosinophil and Mo/Mac -attracting chemokines (MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4 and CCL11). Proteomics analyses demonstrated a massive systemic cytokine storm in COVID-MDR compared with the relatively milder cytokine storm observed in DRESS, while MDR did not exhibit such features. CONCLUSION: A systemic cytokine storm may promote activation of Mo/Mac and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in severe COVID-19 patients, which in turn may impact the development of MDR.","Mitamura, Yasutaka; Schulz, Daniel; Oro, Saskia; Li, Nick; Kolm, Isabel; Lang, Claudia; Ziadlou, Reihane; Tan, Ge; Bodenmiller, Bernd; Steiger, Peter; Marzano, Angelo; de Prost, Nicolas; Caudin, Olivier; Levesque, Mitchell; Stoffel, Corinne; Schmid-Grendelmeier, Peter; Maverakis, Emanual; Akdis, Cezmi A; Brüggen, Marie-Charlotte",Allergy,,311

A small single center study,2021,"The influence of patient characteristics and immunosuppression management on COVID-19 outcomes in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) remains uncertain. We performed a single-center, retrospective review of all adult KTRs admitted to the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 between 03/15/2020 and 05/15/2020. Patients were followed from the date of admission up to 1 month following hospital discharge or study conclusion (06/15/2020). Baseline characteristics, laboratory parameters, and immunosuppression were compared between survivors and patients who died to identify predictors of mortality. 38 KTRs with a mean baseline eGFR of 52.5 ml/min/1.73 m2 were hospitalized during the review period. Maintenance immunosuppression included tacrolimus (84.2%), mycophenolate (89.5%), and corticosteroids (81.6%) in the majority of patients. Eleven patients (28.9%) died during the hospitalization. Older age (OR = 2.05; 1.04-4.04), peak D-dimer (OR = 1.20; 1.04-1.39), and peak white blood cell count (OR = 1.11; 1.02-1.21) were all associated with mortality among KTRs hospitalized for COVID-19. Increased mortality was also observed among KTRs with concomitant HIV infection (87.5% vs. 36.1%; p < .01). Conversely, immunosuppression intensity and degree of reduction following COVID-19 diagnosis were not associated with either survival or acute allograft rejection. Our findings potentially support a strategy of individualization of immunosuppression targets based on patient-specific risk factors, rather than universal immunosuppression reduction for KTRs at risk from COVID-19.","Santeusanio, Andrew D; Menon, Madhav C; Liu, Caroline; Bhansali, Arjun; Patel, Niralee; Mahir, Fahima; Rana, Meenakshi; Tedla, Fasika; Mahamid, Ahmad; Fenig, Yaniv; Zendel, Alexey; Delaney, Veronica; De Boccardo, Graciela; Farouk, Samira S; Sehgal, Vinita; Khaim, Rafael; Jacobs, Samantha E; Dunn, Dallas; Sullivan, Timothy; Taimur, Sarah; Baneman, Emily; Florman, Sander; Shapiro, Ron",Clin Transplant,,311

However, the releasing of chemical substances cannot be avoided during the PRBs operation. In this study, a novel permeable electrochemical reactive barrier (PERB) was fabricated for underground water remediation using a TiO2/graphite composite (TiO2/C) as the heterogeneous electrocatalyst. TiO2/C performed an electro-Fenton-like reaction on cathode and an anodic oxidation on anode respectively, along with the variety of the TiO2 lattice. The performance of this PERB system was evaluated using tetracycline hydrochloride (TTC) degradation. TTC could be degraded at a low applied potential and a wide range of pH. The degradation rate of about 60% was obtained at the optimized reaction condition: the interelectrode potential difference of 1.2 V, pH 3.0, the anode 10 cm above cathode. The relative position and spacing of the electrodes effected the mass transfer equilibrium of TTC. During the 25-day persistent degradation of TTC, the PERB system shown a perfect stability with rarely leaching of Ti. This work explored the potential for underground water remediation by the electrocatalysis with the goal of establishing a clean and eco-friendly PERB system.","Zhang, Wen; Gao, Mingming; Miao, Fei; Wu, Xiaoyan; Wang, Shuguang; Wang, Xinhua",J Hazard Mater,,311

449801,"Commentary on ""Prone Positioning of Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Who Are Nonintubated in Hypoxic Respiratory Distress""",2021,"We consider the problem of optimizing the distribution operations of a hub using drones to deliver medical supplies to different geographic regions. Drones are an innovative method with many benefits including low-contact delivery thereby reducing the spread of pandemic and vaccine-preventable diseases. While we focus on medical supply delivery for this work, it is applicable to drone delivery for many other applications, including food, postal items, and e-commerce delivery. In this paper, our goal is to address drone delivery challenges by optimizing the distribution operations at a drone hub that dispatch drones to different geographic locations generating stochastic demands for medical supplies. By considering different geographic locations, we consider different classes of demand that require different flight ranges, which is directly related to the amount of charge held in a drone battery. We classify the stochastic demands based on their distance from the drone hub, use a Markov decision process to model the problem, and perform computational tests using realistic data representing a prominent drone delivery company. We solve the problem using a reinforcement learning method and show its high performance compared with the exact solution found using dynamic programming. Finally, we analyze the results and provide insights for managing the drone hub operations.","Asadi, Amin; Pinkley, Sarah Nurre",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04729v1.pdf,311

(Covid-19 part II.),2020,"PURPOSE: We present the strategy of a comprehensive cancer center organized to make operations pandemic proof and achieve continuity of cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Disease Outbreak Response (DORS) measures implemented at our center and its satellite clinics included strict infection prevention, manpower preservation, prudent resource allocation, and adaptation of standard-of-care treatments. Critical day-to-day clinical operations, number of persons screened before entry, staff temperature monitoring, and personal protection equipment stockpile were reviewed as a dashboard at daily DORS taskforce huddles. Polymerase chain reaction swab tests performed for patients and staff who met defined criteria for testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were tracked. Descriptive statistics of outpatient attendances and treatment caseloads from February 3 to May 23, 2020, were compared with the corresponding period in 2019. RESULTS: We performed COVID-19 swabs for 80 patients and 93 staff, detecting three cancer patients with community-acquired COVID-19 infections with no nosocomial transmission. Patients who required chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery and patients who are on maintenance treatment continued to receive timely treatment without disruption. The number of intravenous chemotherapy treatments was maintained at 97.8% compared with 2019, whereas that of weekly radiotherapy treatments remained stable since December 2019. All cancer-related surgeries proceeded without delay, with a 0.3% increase in workload. Surveillance follow-ups were conducted via teleconsultation, accounting for a 30.7% decrease in total face-to-face clinic consultations. CONCLUSION: Through the coordinated efforts of a DORS taskforce, it is possible to avoid nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmissions among patients and staff without compromising on care delivery at a national cancer center.","Kwek, Jin Wei; Chan, Jack J; Kanesvaran, Ravindran; Wang, Michael L C; Neo, Patricia S H; Chia, Claramae S; Tham, Chee Kian; Chew, Lita S T; Tan, Hiang Khoon; Yap, Swee Peng; Dent, Rebecca A; Hwang, William Y K; Lim, Soon Thye",JCO Oncol Pract,,311

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 492 COVID-19 patients admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU), 50 had AKI necessitating CRRT (10.16%) and were enrolled in the study. Upon ICU admission, all had AKI, ARDS, septic shock, and CRS. In addition to CRRT with CytoSorb® , all received ARDS-net ventilation, prone positioning, plus empiric ribavirin, interferon beta-1b, antibiotics, hydrocortisone, and prophylactic anticoagulation. We retrospectively analyzed inflammatory biomarkers, oxygenation, organ function, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length-of-stay, and mortality on day-28 post-ICU admission. RESULTS: Patients were 49.64 ±8.90 years old (78% male) with body mass index of 26.70±2.76 kg/m2 . On ICU admission, mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, was 22.52±1.1. Sequential Organ Function Assessment (SOFA) score was 9.36±2.068 and the ratio of partial arterial pressure of oxygen to fractional inspired concentration of oxygen (PaO2 /FiO2 ) was 117.46±36.92. Duration of mechanical ventilation was 17.38±7.39 days, ICU length-of-stay was 20.70±8.83 days, and mortality 28 days post-ICU admission was 30%. Non-survivors had higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers, and more unresolved shock, ARDS, AKI, and pulmonary emboli (8% vs. 4 %, p<0.05) compared to survivors. After 2±1 CRRT sessions with CytoSorb® , survivors had decreased SOFA scores, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, D-dimers, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6; and increased PaO2 /FiO2 ratios, and lymphocyte counts (all p<0.05). Receiver-operator-curve analysis showed that post therapy values of interleukin-6 (cutoff point > 620 pg/ml) predicted in-hospital mortality for critically ill COVID-19 patients (area-under-the-curve: 0.87, 95% confidence-intervals: 0.81-0.93; p=0.001). No side effects of therapy were recorded.

453904,Challenges in the Production of Convalescent Hyperimmune Plasma in the Age of COVID-19,2020,"Hybridization has frequently been observed between wild and domestic species and can substantially impact genetic diversity of both counterparts. Geese show some of the highest levels of interspecific hybridization across all bird orders, and two of the goose species in the genus Anser have been domesticated providing an excellent opportunity for a joint study of domestication and hybridization. Until now, knowledge of the details of the goose domestication process has come from archaeological findings and historical writings supplemented with a few studies based on mitochondrial DNA. Here, we used genome-wide markers to make the first genome-based inference of the timing of European goose domestication. We also analyzed the impact of hybridization on the genome-wide genetic variation in current populations of the European domestic goose and its wild progenitor: the graylag goose (Anser anser). Our dataset consisted of 58 wild graylags sampled around Eurasia and 75 domestic geese representing 14 breeds genotyped for 33,527 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Demographic reconstruction and clustering analysis suggested that divergence between wild and domestic geese around 5,300 generations ago was followed by long-term genetic exchange, and that graylag populations have 3.2-58.0% admixture proportions with domestic geese, with distinct geographic patterns. Surprisingly, many modern European breeds share considerable (> 10%) ancestry with the Chinese domestic geese that is derived from the swan goose Anser cygnoid We show that the domestication process can progress despite continued and pervasive gene flow from the wild form.","Heikkinen, Marja E; Ruokonen, Minna; White, Thomas A; Alexander, Michelle M; Gündüz, Islam; Dobney, Keith M; Aspi, Jouni; Searle, Jeremy B; Pyhäjärvi, Tanja",G3 (Bethesda Md.),,311

T cell immunodeficiency can be acquired in the form of inborn errors, or can result from perturbations to the thymus due to aging or irradiation/chemotherapy required for cancer treatment. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) from compatible donors is a cornerstone for the treatment of hematological malignancies and immunodeficiency. Although it can restore a functional immune system, profound impairments exist in recovery of the T cell compartment. T cells remain absent or low in number for many months after HSCT, depending on a variety of factors including the age of the recipient. While younger patients have a shorter refractory period, the prolonged T cell recovery observed in older patients can lead to a higher risk of opportunistic infections and increased predisposition to relapse. Thus, strategies for enhancing T cell recovery in aged individuals are needed to counter thymic damage induced by radiation and chemotherapy toxicities, in addition to naturally occurring age-related thymic involution. Preclinical results have shown that robust and rapid long-term thymic reconstitution can be achieved when progenitor T cells, generated in vitro from HSCs, are co-administered during HSCT. Progenitor T cells appear to rely on lymphostromal crosstalk via receptor activator of NF-&#954;B (RANK) and RANK-ligand (RANKL) interactions, creating chemokine-rich niches within the cortex and medulla that likely favor the recruitment of bone marrow-derived thymus seeding progenitors. Here, we employed preclinical mouse models to demonstrate that in vitro-generated progenitor T cells can effectively engraft involuted aged thymuses, which could potentially improve T cell recovery. The utility of progenitor T cells for aged recipients positions them as a promising cellular therapy for immune recovery and intrathymic repair following irradiation and chemotherapy, even in a post-involution thymus.","Singh, Jastaranpreet; Mohtashami, Mahmood; Anderson, Graham; Zúñiga-Pflücker, Juan Carlos",Front Immunol,,311

Since there are currently no coded therapies or guidelines for treatment of COVID-19, this study aimed to evaluate the possible role of a specific oral bacteriotherapy as complementary therapeutic strategy to avoid the progression of COVID-19. Methods: We provide a report of 70 patients positive for COVID-19, hospitalized between March 9th and April 4th, 2020. All the patients had fever, required non-invasive oxygen therapy and presented a CT lung involvement on imaging more than 50%. Forty-two patients received hydroxychloroquine, antibiotics, and tocilizumab, alone or in combination. A second group of 28 subjects received the same therapy added with oral bacteriotherapy, using a multistrain formulation. Results: The two cohorts of patients were comparable for age, sex, laboratory values, concomitant pathologies, and the modality of oxygen support. Within 72 h, nearly all patients treated with bacteriotherapy showed remission of diarrhea and other symptoms as compared to less than half of the not supplemented group. The estimated risk of developing respiratory failure was eight-fold lower in patients receiving oral bacteriotherapy. Both the prevalence of patients transferred to ICU and mortality were higher among the patients not treated with oral bacteriotherapy. Conclusions: A specific bacterial formulation showed a significant ameliorating impact on the clinical conditions of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results also stress the importance of the gut-lung axis in controlling the COVID-19 disease.","d039,; Ettorre, Gabriella; Ceccarelli, Giancarlo; Marazzato, Massimiliano; Campagna, Giuseppe; Pinacchio, Claudia; Alessandri, Francesco; Ruberto, Franco; Rossi, Giacomo; Celani, Luigi; Scagnolari, Carolina; Mastropietro, Cristina; Trinchieri, Vito; Recchia, Gregorio Egidio; Mauro, Vera; Antonelli, Guido; Pugliese, Francesco; Mastroianni, Claudio Maria",Front.

A PCR ainda pode oferecer o recurso de identificação molecular do agente em pesquisa, quando marcadores filogeneticamente informativos são amplificados e seqüenciados. Neste sentido, foi realizado o presente trabalho, cujo objetivo foi avaliar o desempenho analítico e diagnóstico de PCRs baseadas em primers direcionados a marcadores universais para diagnosticar Leishmania spp. localizados em dois genomas da célula parasitária, a saber, kDNA (maxicírculo e minicírculo) e DNA nuclear. Foram avaliadas PCRs baseadas em primers direcionados ao (i) DNA de kinetoplasto (kDNA) minicirculo, ao gene codificador de Citocromo B e Citocromo C Oxidase subunidade II presentes no (ii) kDNA maxicírculo, e ao gene codificador Citicromo C, presente no (iii) DNA nuclear. Pelos resultados infere-se que a PCR direcionada ao kDNA de minicírculo apresentou uma sensibilidade analítica muito superior às PCRs direcionadas ao DNA maxicirculo e nuclear.

Age-related and occupational aspects of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in healthcare workers are not well understood. Aims:Conduct a selective study of seroprevalence to the SARS-CoV-2 virus among 348 medical workers of 10 medical organizations in Kazan: seven multidisciplinary hospitals that have been re-profiled to provide medical care to patients with coronavirus infection, an ambulance station, a medical organization that carries out outpatient activities and a specialized clinic. Materials and methods. Among those surveyed on a professional basis, the groups «Doctors», «Nurses», «Junior medical personnel», «Other medical workers» were identified. The age structure of seroprevalence was studied in groups of 18–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59 and 60–69 years. For the determination of IgG, a solid-phase ELISA was used. Results. The proportion of medical workers (MR) of various medical organizations in Kazan seropositive for IgG to the SARS-CoV-2 virus is 16.4%. The wide variation in the seroprevalence value of MR groups of different medical organizations (3.3–30.8%) may indicate a different level of effectiveness of anti-epidemic measures in these institutions. The maximum rate was noted in the age groups – 18–29 years (21%) and 60-69 years (18.2%). According to the professional criterion, a comparable level of seroprevalence is shown for the categories «Doctors» and «Nurses» with a wide variation in indicators in professional groups, depending on a particular medical organization. The obtained results indicate the presence among medical workers who have suffered or have an asymptomatic course of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, and confirm the relevance of further serological monitoring in medical organizations of various profiles. The results of serological monitoring, taking into account age and professional aspects, can serve as the basis for adjusting preventive measures on the basis of individual medical organizations, and taking into account the recommendations of Rospotrebnadzor and the selection of contingents for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: For the MR of various medical institutions in Kazan, the seroprevalence for antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus is 16.4%;Age aspects affect the level of seroprevalence in MR;The obtained results indicate the presence of persons among MR who have had or have an asymptomatic course of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, and confirm the relevance of further serological monitoring in medical organizations of various profiles. © 2021, Numikom.

479272,Deep vein thrombosis in patients with covid-19 pneumonia,2020,"Despite numerous technological and medical advances, out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) still suffer from suboptimal survival rates and poor subsequent neurological and functional outcomes amongst survivors. Multiple studies have investigated the implementation of high-quality prehospital resuscitative efforts, and across these studies, different terms describing high-quality resuscitative efforts have been used, such as high-performance CPR (HP CPR), multi-tiered response (MTR) and minimally interrupted cardiac resuscitation (MICR). There is no universal definition for HP CPR, and dissimilar designs have been employed. This systematic review thus aimed to review current evidence on HP CPR implementation and examine the factors that may influence OHCA outcomes. Eight studies were systematically reviewed, and seven were included in the final meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analysis found a significantly improved likelihood of prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (pooled odds ratio (OR) = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.16 to 1.82, p &lt; 0.001), survival-to-discharge (pooled OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.16 to 1.50, p &lt; 0.001) and favourable neurological outcomes (pooled OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.39, p &lt; 0.001) with HP CPR or similar interventions. However, the studies had generally high heterogeneity (I-2 greater than 50%) and overall moderate-to-severe risk for bias.

Here we aimed to develop global guidance for best practices of infusion centres for IBD patients and to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these centres. Under the auspices of the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease [IOIBD], a task force [TF] was formed, an online survey was developed to query infusion centre protocols during COVID-19, and recommendations were made, based on TF experience and opinion. Recommendations focus mainly on patients screening, infusion centres re-organization, personnel protection, and protocol modifications such as shortening infusion duration or replacing it with subcutaneous alternatives. Implementing these recommendations will hopefully reduce exposure of both IBD patients and care givers to SARS-COV-2 and improve the function and safety of infusion centres during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as potential future threats.","Dotan, Iris; Panaccione, Remo; Kaplan, Gilaad G; O039,; Morain, Colm; Lindsay, James O; Abreu, Maria T",J Crohns Colitis,,311

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients &#8805;70 years with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases department of the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Paris, France, from March 1st to April 15th 2020 were included. The primary outcome was death four weeks after hospital admission. Data on demographics, clinical features, laboratory tests, CT-scan findings, therapeutic management and complications were collected. RESULTS: All in all, 100 patients were analyzed, including 49 patients &#8805;80 years. Seventy percent had &#8805;2 comorbidities. Respiratory features were often severe as 48% needed oxygen support upon admission. Twenty-eight out of 43 patients (65%) with a CT-scan had mild to severe parenchymal impairment, and 38/43 (88%) had bilateral impairment. Thirty-two patients presented respiratory distress requiring oxygen support &#8805;6 liters/minute. Twenty-four deaths occurred, including 21 during hospitalization in our unit, 2 among the 8 patients transferred to ICU, and one at home after discharge from hospital, leading to a global mortality rate of 24% at W4. Age, acute renal failure and respiratory distress were associated with mortality at W4. CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of elderly COVID-19 patients with several comorbidities and severe clinical features survived, a finding that could provide arguments against transferring the most fragile patients to ICU.","Palich, R; Wakim, Y; Itani, O; Paccoud, O; Boussouar, S; Lévy-Soussan, M; Soulie, C; Godefroy, N; Bleibtreu, A",,,311

Telemedicine provides a means to deliver clinical care while limiting patient and provider exposure to the COVID-19. As such, telemedicine is finding applications in a variety of clinical environments including primary care and the acute care setting and the array of patient populations who use telemedicine continues to grow. Yet as telehealth becomes ubiquitous, it is critical to consider its potential to exacerbate disparities in care. Challenges accessing technology and digital literacy, for example, disproportionately impact older patients and those living in poverty. When implemented with the consideration of health disparities, telemedicine provides an opportunity to address these inequities. This manuscript explores potential mechanisms by which telemedicine may play a role in exacerbating or ameliorating disparities in care. We further describe a framework and suggested strategies with which to implement telemedicine systems to improve health equity.","Samuels-Kalow, Margaret; Jaffe, Todd; Zachrison, Kori",Emerg. med. j,,311

The recordings of these interviews were subjected to a thematic analysis. Results: Four main themes were identified: powerless and unappreciated; coping under lockdown; support; and the impact of lockdown on well-being. Conclusions: The parents of adults with ID who made up our sample reported that they received little support from services and experienced a sense of powerlessness. Nevertheless, they were open to accepting support from family and friends and showed remarkable resilience. These findings are discussed in the light of the Willner et al.

494115,Pediatric Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19): Meta-analyzing Literature Versus Natural History,2020,"BACKGROUND: Personal protective equipment (PPE) is a critical need during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Alternative sources of surgical masks, including 3-dimensionally (3D) printed approaches that may be reused, are urgently needed to prevent PPE shortages. Few data exist identifying decontamination strategies to inactivate viral pathogens and retain 3D-printing material integrity. OBJECTIVE: To test viral disinfection methods on 3D-printing materials. METHODS: The viricidal activity of common disinfectants (10% bleach, quaternary ammonium sanitizer, 3% hydrogen peroxide, or 70% isopropanol and exposure to heat (50°C, and 70°C) were tested on four 3D-printed materials used in the healthcare setting, including a surgical mask design developed by the Veterans' Health Administration. Inactivation was assessed for several clinically relevant RNA and DNA pathogenic viruses, including severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 and all viruses tested were completely inactivated by a single application of bleach, ammonium quaternary compounds, or hydrogen peroxide. Similarly, exposure to dry heat (70°C) for 30 minutes completely inactivated all viruses tested. In contrast, 70% isopropanol reduced viral titers significantly less well following a single application. Inactivation did not interfere with material integrity of the 3D-printed materials. CONCLUSIONS: Several standard decontamination approaches effectively disinfected 3D-printed materials. These approaches were effective in the inactivation SARS-CoV-2, its surrogates, and other clinically relevant viral pathogens. The decontamination of 3D-printed surgical mask materials may be useful during crisis situations in which surgical mask supplies are limited.","Welch, Jennifer L; Xiang, Jinhua; Mackin, Samantha R; Perlman, Stanley; Thorne, Peter; O039,; Shaughnessy, Patrick; Strzelecki, Brian; Aubin, Patrick; Ortiz-Hernandez, Monica; Stapleton, Jack T",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,311
494657,Influence of vitamin D status on hospital length of stay and prognosis in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19: a multicenter prospective cohort study,2021,"Background. The pandemic of Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging, given the large number of hospitalized patients. Cardiovascular co-morbidities are linked to a higher mortality risk. Thus, patients with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) might represent a high-risk population. Nevertheless, no data about them are available, yet. Hence, we conducted a nationwide survey to assess clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with congenital heart disease affected by COVID-19. Methods and Results. This is a multi-centre, observational, nationwide survey, involving high-volume Italian CHD centres. COVID-19 diagnosis was defined as either “clinically suspected” or “confirmed”, where a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) test had been performed and was positive. Cardiovascular comorbidities were observed among adult patients—atrial fibrillation (seven; 9%), hypertension (five; 7%), obesity (seven; 9%) and diabetes (one; 1%)—but were absent among children. Cardiovascular complications were mainly observed in the “confirmed” COVID-19+group, consisting of heart failure (9%), palpitations/arrhythmias (3%), stroke/TIA (3%) and pulmonary hypertension (3%). Cardiovascular symptoms such as chest pain (1%), myocardial injury (1%) and pericardial effusion (1%) were also recorded. On the contrary, CHD patients from the clinically suspected COVID-19 group presented no severe symptoms or complications. Conclusions. Despite previous reports pointing to a higher case-fatality rate among patients with cardiovascular co-morbidities, we observed a mild COVID-19 clinical course in our cohort of CHD patients. Although these results should be confirmed in larger cohorts to investigate the underlying mechanisms, the findings of low cardiovascular complications rates and no deaths are reassuring for CHD patients.","Sabatino, Jolanda; Ferrero, Paolo; Chessa, Massimo; Bianco, Francesco; Ciliberti, Paolo; Secinaro, Aurelio; Oreto, Lilia; Avesani, Martina; Bucciarelli, Valentina; Calcaterra, Giuseppe; Calabrò, Maria Pia; Russo, Maria Giovanna; Bassareo, Pier Paolo; Guccione, Paolo; Indolfi, Ciro; Di Salvo, Giovanni",J.

The aim of the current study was to assess whether the discontinuation from a systematic intradialytic exercise training program will affect aspects of health-related QoL and functional capacity in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Seventeen hemodialysis patients (12 Males/5 Females, age 60.8 ± 13.6 year) participated in this study. Patients were assessed for functional capacity using various functional capacity tests while QoL, daily sleepiness, sleep quality, depression and fatigue were assessed using validated questionnaires at the end of a 12-month aerobic exercise program and after 12 months of detraining. RESULTS: The detraining significantly reduced patients' QoL score by 20% (P = 0.01). More affected were aspects related to the physical component summary of the QoL (P < 0.001) rather than those related to the mental one (P = 0.096). In addition, the performance in the functional capacity tests was reduced (P < 0.05), while sleep quality (P = 0.020) and daily sleepiness scores (P = 0.006) were significantly worse after the detraining period. Depressive symptoms (P = 0.214) and the level of fatigue (P = 0.163) did not change significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Detraining has a detrimental effect in patients' QoL, functional capacity and sleep quality. The affected physical health contributed significantly to the lower QoL score. It is crucial for the chronic disease patients, even during emergencies such as lockdowns and restrictions in activities to maintain a minimum level of activity to preserve some of the acquired benefits and maintain their health status.","Rosa, Clara Suemi Costa; Giannaki, Christoforos D; Krase, Argyro; Mplekou, Meropi; Grigoriou, Stefania S; Stefanidis, Ioannis; Lavdas, Eleftherios; Pappas, Aggelos; Bloxham, Saul; Karatzaferi, Christina; Sakkas, Giorgos K",Int Urol Nephrol,,311
496595,"Implications of Laboratory Tests in Disease Grading and Death Risk-Stratification of COVID-19: A Retrospective Study in Wuhan, China (preprint)",2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has raised many questions about the management of COPD patients and whether modifications of their therapy are required. It has raised questions about recognising and differentiating COVID-19 from COPD given the similarity of the symptoms. It is unclear whether COPD patients are at increased risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. During periods of high prevalence of COVID-19, spirometry should be used when essential for COPD diagnosis and/or to assess lung function status for interventional procedures or surgery. COPD patients should follow basic infection control measures including social distancing, hand washing and wearing a mask or face covering. Although data are limited, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodilators, roflumilast, or chronic macrolides should continue to be used as indicated for stable COPD management. Systemic steroids and antibiotics should be used in COPD exacerbations according to the usual indications. Differentiating symptoms of COVID-19 infection from chronic underlying symptoms or those of an COPD exacerbation may be challenging. If there is suspicion for COVID-19, testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered. Patients who developed moderate to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization and pneumonia, should be treated with evolving pharmacotherapeutic approaches, as appropriate, including remdesivir, dexamethasone, and anticoagulation. Managing acute respiratory failure should include appropriate oxygen supplementation, prone positioning, noninvasive ventilation, and protective lung ventilation in patients with ARDS. Patients who develop mild COVID-19 should be followed as normal. Patients who developed moderate or worse COVID-19 should be monitored more frequently than normally with particular attention to the need for oxygen therapy.

Following the collection of 2470 responses from an anonymous questionnaire distributed between October and November 2020 across Israel, we analyzed the responses of physicians, life science graduates (biology, virology, chemistry, etc.), and the general public to whether they would obtain a COVID-19 vaccine with particular vaccine characteristics such as vaccine country of origin, technology, side effect profile, efficacy, and other attributes. Physicians and life science graduates were least likely to accept a vaccine based on mRNA technology (30%) while the general population seemed to adopt any vaccine technology if the declared efficacy is above 90% and the country of manufacturing is the USA/UK rather than China or Russia. However, current inoculation rates in Israel far outpace our predicted rate. Our results highlight the importance of tailored vaccine educational campaigns based on population demographic details and specific vaccine concerns.","Dror, Amiel A; Daoud, Amani; Morozov, Nicole G; Layous, Eli; Eisenbach, Netanel; Mizrachi, Matti; Rayan, Doaa; Bader, Ahmad; Francis, Shawky; Kaykov, Edward; Barhoum, Masad; Sela, Eyal",Eur. j. epidemiol,,311
498266,VP45.32: Pressing goals at the time of COVID: rebuilding patient attention and organisation of the gynecology department in a Spanish tertiary care hospital,2020,"In this work, an all-fiber pyro- and piezo-electric nanogenerator (PPNG) is designed using multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) doped poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) electrospun nanofibers as the active layer and an interlocked conducting micro-fiber based electrode for converting both thermal and mechanical energies into useful electrical power. The PPNG generates high electrical throughput (output voltage similar to 35 V, maximum power density similar to 34 mu W cm(-2) and power conversion efficiency (eta(piezo)) similar to 19.3%) with an ultra-fast response time of similar to 10 ms. Owing to the higher piezoelectric charge co-efficient (;d(33);similar to 51.3 pC N-1) and figure of merit (FoM approximate to 5.95 x 10(-11) Pa-1) of PVDF-MWCNT nanofibers in comparison to the neat PVDF nanofibers (;d(33);similar to 22 pC N-1 and FoM approximate to 9.7 x 10(-12) Pa-1) the PPNG operates a range of consumer electronic components such as capacitors and light emitting diodes. Furthermore, the electroactive phase content (similar to 87%) is improved in the active layer due to the interfacial interaction between the surface charges at from the pi-electron cloud of the MWCNT and -CH2- dipoles of the PVDF chain. Additionally, the PVDF-MWCNT nanofibers possess fifteen times higher pyroelectric coefficient (similar to 60 nC m(-2) K-1) compared to that of neat PVDF nanofibers (4 nC m(-2) K-1). As a result, the PPNG is capable of converting very large temperature fluctuations (Delta T similar to 14.30 K) to electrical energy (such as the open-circuit voltage of 250 mV and a short-circuit current of 83 pA). Besides this, it is capable of detecting very low-level thermal fluctuations (as low as Delta T similar to 5.4 K) with responsivity of similar to 1.48 s and possesses very high mechano-sensitivity (similar to 7.5 V kPa(-1)) which makes it feasible for use as a biomedical sensor since the body temperature and bio-mechanical signals (such as breathing temperature, pulse rate, vocal cord vibrations, coughing sound, and so on) have an immense signature of health conditions. As a proof-of-concept, the all-fiber PPNG is employed as a biomedical sensor by integrating with the Internet of Things (IoT) based human health care monitoring system as well as for remote care of infectious diseases (e.g., applicable for pneumonia, COVID-19) by transferring the pulse response, body temperature, coughing and laughing response wirelessly to a smartphone.","Mahanty, B.; Ghosh, S.

499131,Corticosteroids treatment in severe patients with COVID-19: a propensity score matching study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Tracing of SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains is still a major challenge for public health authorities, when incidental contacts are not recalled or are not perceived as potential risk contacts. Viral sequencing can address key questions about SARS-CoV-2 evolution and may support reconstruction of viral transmission networks by integration of molecular epidemiology into classical contact tracing. METHODS: In collaboration with local public health authorities, we set up an integrated system of genomic surveillance in an urban setting, combining a) viral surveillance sequencing, b) genetically based identification of infection clusters in the population, c) integration of public health authority contact tracing data, and d) a user-friendly dashboard application as a central data analysis platform. RESULTS: Application of the integrated system from August to December 2020 enabled a characterization of viral population structure, analysis of four outbreaks at a maximum care hospital, and genetically based identification of five putative population infection clusters, all of which were confirmed by contact tracing. The system contributed to the development of improved hospital infection control and prevention measures and enabled the identification of previously unrecognized transmission chains, involving a martial arts gym and establishing a link between the hospital to the local population. CONCLUSIONS: Integrated systems of genomic surveillance could contribute to the monitoring and, potentially, improved management of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the population.","Walker, Andreas; Houwaart, Torsten; Finzer, Patrick; Ehlkes, Lutz; Tyshaieva, Alona; Damagnez, Maximilian; Strelow, Daniel; Duplessis, Ashley; Nicolai, Jessica; Wienemann, Tobias; Tamayo, Teresa; Kohns Vasconcelos, Malte; Hülse, Lisanna; Hoffmann, Katrin; Lübke, Nadine; Hauka, Sandra; Andree, Marcel; Däumer, Martin P; Thielen, Alexander; Kolbe-Busch, Susanne; Göbels, Klaus; Zotz, Rainer; Pfeffer, Klaus; Timm, Jörg; Dilthey, Alexander T",Clin. infect. dis,,311

This has led to an increase in internet usage including social media. This study was carried out in order to discover how the pandemic affected the Maltese population who use social media networks daily. METHODS: A dataset comprising more than 50,000 comments and in excess of 150,000 interactions were extracted from Facebook over four months. The method was quantitative and qualitative. Pearson correlation was used to analyse trends. RESULTS: Online interaction increased 200% between February-April 2020, with a significant positive correlation. There was also a significant correlation between online interaction and engagement and the Covid-19 situation in Malta (p âª 0.0001). Online posts portraying a sense of care, affection, and unity increased by more than 300% over the same period, and this also significantly correlated with the number of COVID-19 cases in Malta (p âª 0.0001). An increase in the number of COVID-19 cases had an emotional impact mainly on anxiety and agitation. DISCUSSION: The pandemic has unleashed a veritable 'infodemic' (an over-abundance of information - some accurate and some not). Social media engagement may have been resorted to not only to seek information but also to interact with friends and family who were not physically accessible due to social distancing measures. Yet another reason could have been to seek comfort and reassurance by interacting with those closest to us. Social media is not only an everyday tool but also a haven of last resort when physical connection is not possible.","Agius, Steve; Grech, Anton; Grech, Victor",Early Hum Dev,,311

Lignocaine a common anesthetic agent being used for pain free surgeries for over a long period of time has expressed extensive characteristic of being an anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, direct spasmolytic, ion channel blocking and repolarization agent. We did a literature review Methodology: Currently compiled over-view has for the first time evaluated the probable curative and therapeutic role of nebulized lignocaine drug against SARS CoV-2 by utilization of PubMed, MEDLINE, NHS Evidence and Web of Science databases. Results: With evidence of nebulized lignocaine being used successfully in respiratory illness before and the established role of low concentration lignocaine as ion channel repolarization agent, we try to interpret and deduce the possible implication of nebulized lignocaine as possible therapeutic agent and a potential cure against SARS-CoV-2 caused respiratory illness by acting as an anti-inflammatory agent during SARS-CoV-2 caused acute lung injury and also possibly as an antiviral drug. Conclusion: By the virtue of possessing anti-inflammatory effect and potential antiviral effects, nebulized lignocaine can be a breakthrough in the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Malik, Nasser Ali; Hammodi, Amjid; Jaiswara, Dayanidhi Ramachandra",Anaesth.

METHODS: A 43-question survey was sent to cardiac surgery Centres worldwide. The survey analysed the pre-pandemic organization of the Centre, the Centre's response to Covid-19 in terms of re-organization pathways, surveillance methods, personalprotective equipment (PPE), and allowed surgical practice with results. RESULTS: Sixty-one out of 64 Centres (95.3%) fulfilled the survey. One third of ICUs were transformed into COVID-19 dedicated-ICUs and one-third moved to another location inside the hospital. Negative-pressure rooms were available in 60.6% Centres. Informative measures from hospital administration were received after the first COVID-19 admitted case in 36.1% and during the spread of the infection inside the hospital in 19.6%. Inadequate supply of PPE was common, with no COVID-surveillance of the medical personnel in 4.9% of Centres. COVID-19 infected 7.4% of staff surgeons , 8.3% of residents and 9.5% of anaesthetists. Cardiac surgery caseload declined in 93.4% Centres. COVID-19 infection in patients receiving cardiac surgery resulted in 41-50% mortality in 9.5% Centres, and 91-100% mortality in 4.7% Centres. Successful weaning with survival from V-V ECMO and V-A ECMO was <50% in 79.2% and 80.0% Centres respectively. COVID-19 infection in transplanted patients was rare, with a reported mortality of 0.5% and 1% in one Centre each. CONCLUSIONS: There is room for improvement in hospital surveillance, informative measures and PPE to the personnel. These measurements will reduce current spread of COVID-19 infection among medical personnel and patients, helping the rump up of cardiac surgical practice.","Onorati, Francesco; Myers, Patrick; Bajona, Pietro; Perrotti, Andrea; Mestres, Carlos A; Quintana, Eduard",,,311

We, therefore, aimed to investigate the association of previously diagnosed neurological conditions with COVID-19. 502,536 community-dwelling UK Biobank participants (54.4% male, mean age 56.6 ± 10.3 years) were included. Among these, 57,463 participants had a diagnosis of neurological conditions (11.43%) and a total of 1326 COVID-19-positive cases were identified (0.26%). Neurological conditions were identified through medical history and linkage to data on hospital admissions (ICD-10 code G00-G99). COVID-19 presence was diagnosed using the data provided by Public Health England. The association of previous diagnosis of neurological conditions with COVID-19 was evaluated through logistic regressions, adjusted for potential confounders, reported as odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Nerve, nerve root and plexus disorders (G50-G59) were the most common conditions identified. The presence of COVID-19 was almost doubled in neurological conditions compared to the general population (0.45 vs. 0.24%, p < 0.0001). Previously diagnosed neurological conditions were associated with 60% higher odds of COVID-19 positive in the multivariable-adjusted model (OR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8). Other degenerative diseases of the nervous system, extrapyramidal and movement disorders, polyneuropathies and other disorders of the peripheral nervous system, cerebral palsy and other paralytic syndromes were significantly associated with a higher odds of COVID-19. The presence of neurological conditions was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of COVID-19 compared to the general population.","Veronese, Nicola; Smith, Lee; Barbagallo, Mario; Giannelli, Gianluigi; Caruso, Maria Gabriella; Cisternino, Anna Maria; Notarnicola, Maria; Cao, Chao; Waldhoer, Thomas; Yang, Lin",Acta neurol.

Infantile spasms is an epileptic encephalopathy where treatment lag is a significant predictor of outcome. It is one such condition where telemedicine can make a remarkable difference when in-person consultations are delayed or are not possible. However, the adverse effect profile of the first-line therapeutic options, the need for frequent follow-up, underdeveloped telemedicine services, lack of a rational protocol, poor awareness about infantile spasms, a lesser level of parental understanding, and scarcity of pediatric neurologists are the major hurdles in developing countries. This paper provides a teleneurology based approach for the management of infantile spasms in developing countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. The cornerstones of this approach include the fundamental principles of management of infantile spasms, decentralization of patient care to local health providers, efforts for improving sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis, early initiation of first-line therapeutic options, and constant motivation of parents and local health providers to be vigilant for therapeutic response, adverse effects of therapy, and infections.","Madaan, Priyanka; Kumar Sahu, Jitendra; Wanigasinghe, Jithangi; Fatema, Kanij; Linn, Kyaw; Lhamu Mynak, Mimi; Garófalo Gómez, Nicolás; Samia, Pauline; Poudel, Prakash; Chand, Prem; Riikonen, Raili",Epilepsy Behav Rep,,311

While emerging evidence hints toward prior exposure to common-cold human coronaviruses (HCoV), the extent of- and conditions for-cross-protective immunity between SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVs remain open. Here, by leveraging a comprehensive pool of publicly available functionally evaluated SARS-CoV-2 peptides, we report 126 immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 peptides with high sequence similarity to 285 MHC-presented target peptides from at least one of four HCoV, thus providing a map describing the landscape of SARS-CoV-2 shared and private immunogenic peptides with functionally validated T cell responses. Using this map, we show that while SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic peptides in general exhibit higher level of dissimilarity to both self-proteome and -microbiomes, there exist several SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic peptides with high similarity to various human protein coding genes, some of which have been reported to have elevated expression in severe COVID-19 patients. We then combine our map with a SARS-CoV-2-specific TCR repertoire data from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls and show that whereas the public repertoire for the majority of convalescent patients are dominated by TCRs cognate to private SARS-CoV-2 peptides, for a subset of patients, more than 50% of their public repertoires that show reactivity to SARS-CoV-2, consist of TCRs cognate to shared SARS-CoV-2-HCoV peptides. Further analyses suggest that the skewed distribution of TCRs cognate to shared and private peptides in COVID-19 patients is likely to be HLA-dependent. Finally, by utilising the global prevalence of HLA alleles, we provide 10 peptides with known cognate TCRs that are conserved across SARS-CoV-2 and multiple human coronaviruses and are predicted to be recognised by a high proportion of the global population. Overall, our work indicates the potential for HCoV-SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD8+ T cells, which is likely dependent on differences in HLA-coding genes among individuals. These findings may have important implications for COVID-19 heterogeneity and vaccine-induced immune responses as well as robustness of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.","Buckley, Paul; Lee, Chloe Hyun-jung; Pinho, Mariana Pereira; Babu, Rosana Ottakandathil; Woo, Jeongmin; Antanaviciute, Agne; Simmons, Alison; Ogg, Graham; Koohy, Hashem",,,311

We analyzed California's racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 exposure risks, testing rates, test positivity, and case rates through October 2020, combining data from 15.4 million SARS-CoV-2 tests with subcounty exposure risk estimates from the American Community Survey. We defined ""high-exposure-risk"" households as those with one or more essential workers and fewer rooms than inhabitants. Latino people in California are 8.1 times more likely to live in high-exposure-risk households than White people (23.6 percent versus 2.9 percent), are overrepresented in cumulative cases (3,784 versus 1,112 per 100,000 people), and are underrepresented in cumulative testing (35,635 versus 48,930 per 100,000 people). These risks and outcomes were worse for Latino people than for members of other racial/ethnic minority groups.

We use a simple but effective way to build bilingual word embeddings (BWEs) to evaluate bilingual word similarity and transferred the sentence alignment problem into an extended earth mover's distance (EMD) problem. The proposed method achieved high accuracy in both 1-to-1 and many-to-many cases. Pre-training in general domain, the larger in-domain dataset and n-to-m sentence pairs benefit the NMT model. Fine-tuning in domain corpus helps the translation model learns more terminology and fits the in-domain style of text.","Luo, Shengxuan; Ying, Huaiyuan; Yu, Sheng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08588v1.pdf,311

Quantification of the option's value is of practical importance but remains challenging under the assumption of stochastic rates, as it is determined by an intractable distribution which requires involved approximations. Indeed, many practitioners still rely on deterministic spreads between the rates for valuation. We develop a scalable and stable stochastic model of the collateral spreads under the assumption of conditional independence. This allows for a common factor approximation which admits analytical results from which further estimators are obtained. We show that in modelling the spreads between collateral rates, a second order model yields accurate results for the value of the collateral choice option. The model remains precise for a wide range of model parameters and is numerically efficient even for a large number of collateral currencies.","Wolf, Felix L.; Grzelak, Lech A.; Deelstra, Griselda",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06107v2.pdf,311

Prospective comparative studies with non-CoViD-19 ICU patients are completely lacking. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the incidence of DVT in ICU patients with CoViD-19 compared to non-CoViD-19 ICU patients who were treated in the University Hospital Augsburg during the same period. In addition, the aim was to investigate what type of anticoagulation was present in CoViD-19 patients at the time the DVT occurred and to what extent DVT is associated with increased mortality in this patient population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective single center study, which was conducted between 18 April 2020 and 30 April 2020, 20 SARS-CoV2 positive patients were compared with 20 non-CoVid-19 patients in the ICU with respect to the occurrence of DVT. For this purpose, demographic data, laboratory parameters, and clinical outcomes were recorded and evaluated. RESULTS: The rate of DVT in the investigated patient collective was markedly higher in patients with SARS-CoV2 (CoViD-19 patients 20% vs. non-CoViD-19 patients 5%). Both DVT and elevated D­dimer levels were associated with increased mortality in the present study. CONCLUSION: We recommend the determination of D­dimer levels and, in the case of elevated levels, the broad indication for compression sonography of the deep leg veins on admission of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV2. In this way DVT in the setting of CoViD-19 can be recognized early and therapeutic anticoagulation can be started. All inpatient CoViD-19 patients should receive thrombosis prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin. Further studies on point of care methods (TEG®, ROTEM®) for the detection of hypercoagulability in SARS-CoV2 are necessary.","Zerwes, Sebastian; Hernandez Cancino, F; Liebetrau, D; Gosslau, Y; Warm, T; Märkl, B; Hyhlik-Dürr, A",Chirurg,,311

Beyond the immediate global-wide health response, the pandemic has triggered a significant number of IT initiatives to track, visualize, analyze and potentially mitigate the phenomenon. For individuals or organizations interested in developing COVID-19 related software, knowledge-sharing communities such as Stack Overflow proved to be an effective source of information for tackling commonly encountered problems. As an additional contribution to the investigation of this unprecedented health crisis and to assess how fast and how well the community of developers has responded, we performed a study on COVID-19 related posts in Stack Overflow. In particular, we profiled relevant questions based on key post features and their evolution, identified the most prominent technologies adopted for developing COVID-19 software and their interrelations and focused on the most persevering problems faced by developers. For the analysis of posts we employed descriptive statistics, Association Rule Graphs, Survival Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The results reveal that the response of the developers’ community to the pandemic was immediate and that the interest of developers on COVID-19 related challenges was sustained after its initial peak.

589985,Peripheral Inotropes in Critically Ill Children: Is It Safe?,2021-05-31,"Viruses from the Filoviridae family, as many other virus families, require an acidic pH for successful infection and are therefore susceptible to the actions of 4‐aminoquinolines, such as chloroquine. Although the mechanisms of action of chloroquine clearly indicate that it might inhibit filoviral infections, several clinical trials that attempted to use chloroquine in the treatment of other acute viral infections – including dengue and influenza A and B – caused by low pH‐dependent viruses, have reported that chloroquine had no clinical efficacy, and these results demoted chloroquine from the potential treatments for other virus families requiring low pH for infectivity. The present review is aimed at investigating whether chloroquine could combat the present Ebola virus epidemic, and also at exploring the main reasons for the reported lack of efficacy. Literature was sourced from PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, reference list of articles and textbooks – Fields Virology (Volumes 1and 2), the cytokine handbook, Pharmacology in Medicine: Principles and Practice, and hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine retinopathy. The present analysis concludes that (1) chloroquine might find a place in the treatment of Ebola, either as a monotherapy or in combination therapies; (2) the ineffectiveness of chloroquine, or its analogue, hydroxychloroquine, at treating infections from low pH‐dependent viruses is a result of the failure to attain and sustain a steady state concentration sufficient to increase and keep the pH of the acidic organelles to approximately neutral levels; (3) to successfully treat filoviral infections – or other viral infections that emerge or emerged from low pH‐dependent viruses – a steady state chloroquine plasma concentration of at least 1 µg/mL(~3.125 μM/L) or a whole blood concentration of 16 μM/L must be achieved and be sustained until the patients' viraemia becomes undetectable. These concentrations, however, do not rule out the efficacy of other, higher, steady state concentrations – although such concentrations might be accompanied by severe adverse effects or toxicities. The feasibility of the conclusion in the preceding texts has recently been supported by a subsequent study that shows that amodiaquine, a derivative of CQ, is able to protect humans infected with Ebola from death.","Akpovwa, Hephzibah",Cell Biochem Funct,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27001679/; https://doi.org/10.1002/cbf.3182,311

This study aimed to assess COVID-19 related misconception among rural people in Bangladesh and associated socio-demographic and media related factors. METHODS: Multistage sampling method was used to collect data (n = 210) from three unions of Satkhira District, Bangladesh. The dependent variable was the presence of COVID-19 related misconception (Yes, No) which was generated based on respondents’ responses to a set of six questions on various types of misconception. Exposure variables were respondents’ socio-demographic characteristics, mass media and social media exposure. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the characteristics of the respondents. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the factors associated with COVID-19 misconception. RESULTS: More than half of the study respondents had one or more COVID-19 related misconception. Over 50% of the total respondents considered this disease as a punishment from God. Besides, many of the respondents reported that they do not think the virus causing COVID-19 is dangerous (59%) and it is a disease (19%). Around 7% reported they believe the virus is the part of a virus war (7.2%). The bivariate analysis found the presence of socio-demographic factors of the respondents, as well as the factors related to social and mass media, were significantly associated with the COVID-19’s misconception. However, once all factors considered together in the multivariate model, misconception were found to be lower among secondary (AOR, 0.33, 95% CI: 0.13–0.84) and tertiary (AOR, 0.29, 95% CI: 0.09–0.92) educated respondents compared to the respondents with primary education. CONCLUSION: This study obtained a very higher percentage of misconception about the COVID-19 among the respondents of Satkhira district in Bangladesh. This could be a potential challenge to fight against this pandemic which is now ongoing. Prioritizing mass and social media to disseminate evidence-based information as well as educate people about this disease are necessary.","Bakebillah, Md.; Billah, Md.

Much of the challenges result from high demand for limited severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing capacity, a resource required to facilitate patient flow throughout the hospital system and society at large. At our institution, this led to unprecedented increases in inquiries from providers to laboratory staff relating to the expected time to result for their patients. The demand was great enough to require redeployment of staff to handle the laboratory call volume. Although these data are available in our laboratory information system, the data do not interface to our electronic health record system. We developed systems using the R statistical programming language that abstract the necessary data regarding severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction testing from our lab system in real time, store it, and present it to clinicians for on demand querying. These data have been accessed over 2500 times by over 100 distinct users. Median length of each user session is approximately 4.9 minutes. Because our lab information system does not persistently store tracking information while our system does, we have been able to iteratively recalculate time to result values for each tracking stop as workflows have changed over time. Facility with informatics and programming concepts coupled with clinical understanding have allowed us to swiftly develop and iterate on applications which provide efficiency gains, allowing laboratory resources to focus on generating test results for our patients.","Master, Stephen R.; Neide, Brandy; Kollu, Sunaina; Mulchandani, Surabhi; Harris, Rebecca M.; Obstfeld, Amrom E.",Acad Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33884294/; https://doi.org/10.1177/23742895211006822,311

A high degree of consensus was found to temporarily suspend non-critical elective procedures or procedures for benign conditions and to prioritize patients with symptomatic or advanced cancer. Prior to hospitalization, patients should be screened for respiratory symptoms indicating possible COVID-19 infection and most societies recommended to screen all patients for COVID-19 prior to admission. There was a weak consensus on the usage of serology tests and CT scans for COVID-19 diagnostics. Nearly all societies suggested to postpone elective procedures in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and recommended constant reevaluation of these patients. Additionally, we summarized recommendations focusing on precautions in the theater and the management of chest drains. This study provides a novel approach to informed guidance for thoracic surgeons during the COVID-19 pandemic in the absence of scientific evidence-based data.","Dziodzio, Tomasz; Knitter, Sebastian; Wu, Helen Hairun; Ritschl, Paul Viktor; Hillebrandt, Karl-Herbert; Jara, Maximilian; Juraszek, Andrzej; Öllinger, Robert; Pratschke, Johann; Rückert, Jens; Neudecker, Jens",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10132769; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34202563/,311
594686,Video-Assisted Peritoneal Dialysis Placement in COVID-19 Patients,2020-11-25,"BACKGROUND: There is no effective therapy for the severe acute respiratory syndrome by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) responsible for the Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). To date, dexamethasone has shown a decrease in mortality in patients who require oxygen, especially those with invasive mechanical ventilation. However, it is unknown if another corticosteroid can be used, the optimal dose and its duration, to achieve a better clinical outcome. The objective of the study was to compare the differences in clinical outcome and laboratory results in hospitalized patients with severe SARS-CoV2 Pneumonia treated with dexamethasone at 6 mg doses versus patients treated with high-dose methylprednisolone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ambispective cohort study with survival analysis of 216 patients diagnosed with severe Covid-19 pneumonia confirmed by polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV2 by Berlin protocol, who were hospitalized in a high-complexity clinic in Medellín, Colombia. The patients should also have supplementary oxygen and radiological confirmation of Pneumonia by chest tomography. Sample size was not calculated since the total population that met the inclusion criteria was evaluated. 111 patients were treated with the institutional protocol with intravenous dexamethasone 6 mg QD for seven to 10 days if they required oxygen. Since September 15, 2020, the hospitalization protocol of the clinic was modified by the Infectious Diseases and Pulmonology service, recommending a high dose of methylprednisolone of 250 to 500 mg every day for three days with a subsequent change to oral prednisone 50 mg every day for 14 days. The protocol was not applied in the intensive care unit, where dexamethasone continued to be administered. The clinical outcome and differences in laboratory results of the patients who received dexamethasone vs. the prospective cohort that received methylprednisolone from September 15 to October 31, 2020, were evaluated. Follow-up was carried out by outpatient consultation one month after discharge or by telephone, inquiring about readmission or living-dead status. RESULTS: 216 patients had Covid-19 pneumonia documented by ground-glass imaging and alveolar pressure / inspired oxygen fraction (PaFi) less than 300. 111 patients received dexamethasone (DXM) and 105 received methylprednisolone (MTP). Patients in the DXM group evolved to severe ARDS in a higher proportion (26.1% vs 17.1% than the MTP group). Upon completion 4 days of treatment with parenteral corticosteroid, laboratory markers of severity decreased significantly in the group that received MTP, CRP 2.85 (2.3–3.8) vs 7.2 (5.4–9.8), (p-value < 0.0001), D-dimer 691 (612–847) vs 1083 (740–1565) (p-value = 0.04) and DHL 273 (244–289) vs 355 (270.6–422) (p-value = 0.01). After starting the corticosteroid, transfer to the intensive care unit (4.8% vs. 14.4%) and mortality (9,5% vs. 17.1%) was lower in the group that received MTP. Recovery time was shorter in patients treated with MTP, three days (3–4) vs. DXM 6 days (5–8) (p-value < 0.0001). At 30-day follow-up, 88 (92.6%) were alive in MTP vs 58 (63.1%) of those who received dexamethasone. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the treatment of severe Covid-19 Pneumonia with high-dose methylprednisolone for three days followed by oral prednisone for 14 days, compared with 6 mg dexamethasone for 7 to 10 days, statistically significantly decreased the recovery time, the need for transfer to intensive care and the severity markers C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer and LDH. Randomized controlled studies with methylprednisolone are required to corroborate its effect, and studies in a population hospitalized in intensive care wards.","Pinzón, Miguel Alejandro; Ortiz, Santiago; Holguín, Héctor; Betancur, Juan Felipe; Cardona Arango, Doris; Laniado, Henry; Arias Arias, Carolina; Muñoz, Bernardo; Quiceno, Julián; Jaramillo, Daniel; Ramirez, Zoraida",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34033648/,311
597613,Consensus statement on cardiac electrophysiology practices during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: from the Indian Heart Rhythm Society,2021-07-29,"Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs 1, 2 and 3) are thought to restrict numerous viral pathogens including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs). However, most evidence comes from single-round pseudovirus infection studies of cells that overexpress IFITMs. Here, we verified that artificial overexpression of IFITMs blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection. Strikingly, however, endogenous IFITM expression was essential for efficient infection of genuine SARS-CoV-2 in human lung cells. Our results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein interacts with IFITMs and hijacks them for efficient viral entry. IFITM proteins were expressed and further induced by interferons in human lung, gut, heart and brain cells. Intriguingly, IFITM-derived peptides and targeting antibodies inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in human lung cells, cardiomyocytes and gut organoids. Our results show that IFITM proteins are important cofactors for SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cell types representing in vivo targets for viral transmission, dissemination and pathogenesis and suitable targets for therapeutic approaches.","Bozzo, Caterina Prelli; Nchioua, Rayhane; Volcic, Meta; Krüger, Jana; Heller, Sandra; Stürzel, Christina M.; Kmiec, Dorota; Conzelmann, Carina; Müller, Janis; Zech, Fabian; Schütz, Desiree; Koepke, Lennart; Braun, Elisabeth; Groß, Rüdiger; Wettstein, Lukas; Weil, Tatjana; Weiß, Johanna; Sauter, Daniel; Münch, Jan; Diofano, Federica; Goffinet, Christine; Catanese, Alberto; Schön, Michael; Böckers, Tobias; Stenger, Steffen; Sato, Kei; Just, Steffen; Kleger, Alexander; Sparrer, Konstantin M.J.; Kirchhoff, Frank",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.18.255935,311
597783,Effect of dexamethasone on direct Xa-inhibitor oral anticoagulant plasma levels in patients with COVID-19,2021-07-14,"OBJECTIVE: Single cases and small series of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) have been reported during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak worldwide. We evaluated incidence and clinical features of GBS in a cohort of patients from two regions of northern Italy with the highest number of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: GBS cases diagnosed in 12 referral hospitals from Lombardy and Veneto in March and April 2020 were retrospectively collected. As a control population, GBS diagnosed in March and April 2019 in the same hospitals were considered. RESULTS: Incidence of GBS in March and April 2020 was 0.202/100 000/month (estimated rate 2.43/100 000/year) vs 0.077/100 000/month (estimated rate 0.93/100 000/year) in the same months of 2019 with a 2.6-fold increase. Estimated incidence of GBS in COVID-19-positive patients was 47.9/100 000 and in the COVID-19-positive hospitalised patients was 236/100 000. COVID-19-positive patients with GBS, when compared with COVID-19-negative subjects, showed lower MRC sum score (26.3±18.3 vs 41.4±14.8, p=0.006), higher frequency of demyelinating subtype (76.6% vs 35.3%, p=0.011), more frequent low blood pressure (50% vs 11.8%, p=0.017) and higher rate of admission to intensive care unit (66.6% vs 17.6%, p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows an increased incidence of GBS during the COVID-19 outbreak in northern Italy, supporting a pathogenic link. COVID-19-associated GBS is predominantly demyelinating and seems to be more severe than non-COVID-19 GBS, although it is likely that in some patients the systemic impairment due to COVID-19 might have contributed to the severity of the whole clinical picture.","Filosto, Massimiliano; Cotti Piccinelli, Stefano; Gazzina, Stefano; Foresti, Camillo; Frigeni, Barbara; Servalli, Maria Cristina; Sessa, Maria; Cosentino, Giuseppe; Marchioni, Enrico; Ravaglia, Sabrina; Briani, Chiara; Castellani, Francesca; Zara, Gabriella; Bianchi, Francesca; Del Carro, Ubaldo; Fazio, Raffaella; Filippi, Massimo; Magni, Eugenio; Natalini, Giuseppe; Palmerini, Francesco; Perotti, Anna Maria; Bellomo, Andrea; Osio, Maurizio; Scopelliti, Giuseppe; Carpo, Marinella; Rasera, Andrea; Squintani, Giovanna; Doneddu, Pietro Emiliano; Bertasi, Valeria; Cotelli, Maria Sofia; Bertolasi, Laura; Fabrizi, Gian Maria; Ferrari, Sergio; Ranieri, Federico; Caprioli, Francesca; Grappa, Elena; Broglio, Laura; De Maria, Giovanni; Leggio, Ugo; Poli, Loris; Rasulo, Frank; Latronico, Nicola; Nobile-Orazio, Eduardo; Padovani, Alessandro; Uncini, Antonino",J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2020-324837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33158914/,311

598359,Tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID‐19: a single‐center observational analysis,2020-06-17,"BACKGROUND: Serological evaluation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an alternative that allows us to determine the prevalence and dynamics of this infection in populations. The goal of this study was to determine the clinical and sociodemographic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a region of the Colombian Caribbean. METHODS: Between July and November 2020, a cross-sectional observational study was carried out in Córdoba, located in northeast Colombia in the Caribbean area. Eight municipalities with the largest populations were chosen and 2564 blood samples were taken. A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used with the recombinant protein antigen N of SARS-CoV-2. The people included in the study were asked for sociodemographic and clinical data, which were analysed by statistical methods. RESULTS: A seroprevalence of 40.8% was obtained for SARS-CoV-2 in the Córdoba region. In the bivariate analysis, no differences were observed in seropositivity against SARS-CoV-2 for gender or age range (p>0.05). Higher seropositivity was found in low socio-economic status and symptomatic patients (p<0.0001). A total of 30.7% of the asymptomatic patients were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, which could be linked to the spread of this infection. In the multivariate analysis, seroconversion was related to poverty and clinical manifestations such as anosmia and ageusia (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The high seropositivity in Córdoba is due to widespread SARS-CoV-2 in this population. The relationship between seropositivity and socio-economic status suggests a higher exposure risk to the virus caused by informal economic activities in low-income groups. Clinical manifestations such as anosmia and ageusia could be clinical predictors of infection by the new emergent coronavirus.","Garay, Evelin; Serrano-Coll, Héctor; Rivero, Ricardo; Gastelbondo, Bertha; Faccini-Martínez, Álvaro; Berrocal, José; Pérez, Alejandra; Badillo, María; Martínez-Bravo, Caty; Botero, Yesica; Arrieta, Germán; Calderón, Alfonso; Galeano, Ketty; López, Yesica; Miranda, Jorge; Guzmán, Camilo; Contreras, Verónica; Arosemena, Alejandra; Contreras, Héctor; Brango-Tarra, Eimi; Oviedo, Misael; Mattar, Salim",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,https://doi.org/10.1093/trstmh/trab094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34185868/,311

The fight against the COVID-19 has become a very serious international challenge. The aim of this study was to determine the predictors of COVID-19-preventive behaviors using the health belief model (HBM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted with the participation of 558 samples from the adult population of Iran. The online convenience sampling was conducted in this research. The online 68-item questionnaire link was published all over Iran through social networks including Telegram and WhatsApp, which are common in Iran. The data were analyzed using SPSS software version 19. Descriptive statistics, bivariate Pearson's correlation test, and multiple linear regression were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The mean age of the subjects was 33.3 ± 10.01 years. The participants were often female (61.3%), married (57.9%), and resident of the city (81.0%) with university educational level (78.8%). The results showed that the HBM structures predicted 29.3% of the preventive behaviors of COVID-19 in the subjects. The perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and self-efficacy significantly predicted the preventive behaviors, but the perceived susceptibility and perceived severity were not significant in the regression model. The internet and virtual social networks (49.8%), broadcast (33.5%), and healthcare providers (15.8%) were the most important sources of information related with COVID-19. In response to COVID-19-related internal cues to action, 36.6% did not pay attention and 34.7% tried to self-medicate. Only 28.5% of the subjects referred to the hospital, healthcare center, or physician. CONCLUSION: Self-efficacy, perceived barriers, and perceived benefits were the key determinants of COVID-19-preventive behaviors in the subjects. It can be concluded that the HBM is a good tool to predict COVID-19-preventive behaviors in Iranian population.","Mirzaei, Amin; Kazembeigi, Farogh; Kakaei, Hojatollah; Jalilian, Mohsen; Mazloomi, Sajad; Nourmoradi, Heshmatollah",J Educ Health Promot,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34084816/; https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_747_20,311

Local factors that may be associated with variation in SARS-CoV-2 transmission have not been well studied. Objective: To examine the association of county-level factors with variation in the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number over time. Design: Observational study Setting: 211 counties in 46 states and the District of Columbia between February 25, 2020 and April 23, 2020. Participants: Residents within the counties (55% of the US population) Exposures: Social distancing as measured by percent change in visits to non-essential businesses, population density, lagged daily wet bulb temperatures. Main Outcomes and Measures: The instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) which is the estimated number of cases generated by one case at a given time during the pandemic. Results: Median case incidence was 1185 cases and fatality rate was 43.7 deaths per 100,000 people for the top decile of 21 counties, nearly ten times the incidence and fatality rate in the lowest density quartile. Average Rt in the first two weeks was 5.7 (SD 2.5) in the top decile, compared to 3.1 (SD 1.2) in the lowest quartile. In multivariable analysis, a 50% decrease in visits to non-essential businesses was associated with a 57% decrease in Rt (95% confidence interval, 56% to 58%). Cumulative temperature effects over 4 to 10 days prior to case incidence were nonlinear; relative Rt decreased as temperatures warmed above 32F to 53F, which was the point of minimum Rt, then increased between 53F and 66F, at which point Rt began to decrease. At 55F, and with a 70% reduction in visits to non-essential business, 96% of counties were estimated to fall below a threshold Rt of 1.0, including 86% of counties among the top density decile and 98% of counties in the lowest density quartile. Conclusions and Relevance: Social distancing, lower population density, and temperate weather change were associated with a decreased SARS-Co-V-2 Rt in counties across the United States. These relationships can inform selective public policy planning in communities during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Rubin, David; Huang, Jing; Fisher, Brian T; Gasparrini, Antonio; Tam, Vicky; Song, Lihai; Wang, Xi; Kaufman, Jason; Fitzpatrick, Kate; Jain, Arushi; Griffis, Heather; Crammer, Koby; Tasian, Gregory",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.08.20094474v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.20094474,311

In this paper, a detailed characterisation of mild-to-moderate ear, nose nd throat (ENT) symptoms is presented with the aim of recognising the disease early to help reduce further spread and progression. METHODS: A total of 230 cases testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 134 negative controls were recruited for a case-control analysis. Symptoms were analysed using the Acute Respiratory Tract Infections Questionnaire, while other symptoms were investigated by ad hoc questions. RESULTS: Among the study samples (n = 364), 149 were males and 215 were females with age ranging from 20 to 89 years (mean 52.3). Four main groups of symptoms were obtained: influenza-like symptoms, ENT-symptoms, breathing issues and asthenia-related symptoms, representing 72%, 69%, 64% and 53% of overall referred clinical manifestations, respectively. ENT symptoms, breathing issues and influenza-like symptoms were associated with positivity to SARS-CoV-2, whereas asthenia-related symptoms did not show a significant association with SARS-CoV-2 infection after controlling for other symptoms, comorbidities and demographic characteristics.

Although the CCR2–CCL2 axis plays an important role in trafficking CD11b(+) Ly‐6C(hi) monocytes to regulate immunopathological diseases, little is known about their role in monocyte trafficking during viral encephalitis caused by JEV infection. Here, we explored the role of CCR2 and its ligand CCL2 in JE caused by JEV infection using CCR2‐ and CCL2‐ablated murine models. Somewhat surprisingly, the ablation of CCR2 and CCL2 resulted in starkly contrasting susceptibility to JE. CCR2 ablation induced enhanced resistance to JE, whereas CCL2 ablation highly increased susceptibility to JE. This contrasting regulation of JE progression by CCR2 and CCL2 was coupled to central nervous system (CNS) infiltration of Ly‐6C(hi) monocytes and Ly‐6G(hi) granulocytes. There was also enhanced expression of CC and CXC chemokines in the CNS of CCL2‐ablated mice, which appeared to induce CNS infiltration of these cell populations. However, our data revealed that contrasting regulation of JE in CCR2‐ and CCL2‐ablated mice was unlikely to be mediated by innate natural killer and adaptive T‐cell responses. Furthermore, CCL2 produced by haematopoietic stem cell‐derived leucocytes played a dominant role in CNS accumulation of Ly‐6C(hi) monocytes in infected bone marrow chimeric models, thereby exacerbating JE progression. Collectively, our data indicate that CCL2 plays an essential role in conferring protection against JE caused by JEV infection. In addition, blockage of CCR2, but not CCL2, will aid in the development of strategies for prophylactics and therapeutics of JE.","Kim, Jin Hyoung; Patil, Ajit Mahadev; Choi, Jin Young; Kim, Seong Bum; Uyangaa, Erdenebileg; Hossain, Ferdaus Mohd Altaf; Park, Sang‐Youel; Lee, John Hwa; Kim, Koanhoi; Eo, Seong Kug",Immunology,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/imm.12626; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27260136/; https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.12626,311

604511,COVID-19 Antibody Testing in Pregnancy,2020-05-18,"Coronaviruses have exceptionally large RNA genomes of approximately 30 kilobases. Genome replication and transcription is mediated by a multisubunit protein complex comprised of more than a dozen virus-encoded proteins. The protein complex is thought to bind specific cis-acting RNA elements primarily located in the 5′- and 3′-terminal genome regions and upstream of the open reading frames located in the 3′-proximal one-third of the genome. Here, we review our current understanding of coronavirus cis-acting RNA elements, focusing on elements required for genome replication and packaging. Recent bioinformatic, biochemical, and genetic studies suggest a previously unknown level of conservation of cis-acting RNA structures among different coronavirus genera and, in some cases, even beyond genus boundaries. Also, there is increasing evidence to suggest that individual cis-acting elements may be part of higher-order RNA structures involving long-range and dynamic RNA–RNA interactions between RNA structural elements separated by thousands of nucleotides in the viral genome. We discuss the structural and functional features of these cis-acting RNA elements and their specific functions in coronavirus RNA synthesis.","Madhugiri, R.; Fricke, M.; Marz, M.; Ziebuhr, J.",Adv Virus Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.aivir.2016.08.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S006535271630046X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S006535271630046X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27712622/,311

This article investigated the long-term impact of food crises on the financial performance of restaurant firms and identified the factors that influenced this impact. This explanatory study examined the case of Jack in the Box, whose 1993 Escherichia coli scare was the first and largest restaurant-associated food crisis in modern times. An event study method was used to uncover stock price movements of Jack in the Box, in conjunction with 73 unrelated food crises that occurred from 1994 to 2010. Stock prices of Jack in the Box exhibited significantly negative responses to other firms’ food crises, moreover, the negative spillover effect was stronger if the crisis occurred closer in time, was similar in nature, and was accompanied with no recall execution. These findings shed light on the long-term financial impact of food crises and offer insights for crisis managers to develop more effective crisis management strategies.","Seo, Soobin; Jang, SooCheong (Shawn); Almanza, Barbara; Miao, Li; Behnke, Carl",Int J Hosp Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287858/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2014.02.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278431914000401; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278431914000401,311
605309,On Lung Ultrasound Patterns Specificity in the Management of COVID‐19 Patients,2020-05-08,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak and the measures to contain the global pandemic can have an impact on the well-being and mental health status of individuals. Parents of young children are particularly at risk for high levels of parental stress due to the current public health crisis, which can impact parenting behaviors and children’s well-being. Although different initial scales have been developed to measure COVID-19–related anxiety, they have not yet been tested sufficiently in parent samples. A brief measure of COVID-19–related anxiety is necessary for both quick assessment in practice and in larger epidemiological studies of parents. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to compare the distributions, validities, and reliabilities of four different COVID-19 anxiety scales: Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, Pandemic Anxiety Scale, and one subscale of the COVID Stress Scales. Based on the psychometric properties of these scales, we aim to provide recommendations for a brief unidimensional inventory to assess COVID-19–related anxiety among parents. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey of 515 German-speaking parents (465 mothers, 90.3%) with at least one child aged 0-6 years was conducted during a 6-week period (June 29 to August 9, 2020). Half of the parents were recruited via Facebook parenting groups, while the other half were recruited through childcare centers. We psychometrically tested 25 items on COVID-19–related anxiety using the framework of classical test theory, including item analysis, correlational analysis of family variables, and exploratory factor analysis. Moreover, an item response theory approach was applied to estimate item discriminations and item difficulties. RESULTS: Based on the psychometric properties, three items of the Pandemic Anxiety Scale were identified as a single unidimensional factor. The adapted scale demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (α=.79), moderate to high item discrimination, strong positive intercorrelation with two other COVID-19 anxiety scales, and a small positive association with parenting stress. Mothers and fathers did not differ in total scores (t(513)=−0.79, P=.42). CONCLUSIONS: Factor analysis suggests that existing COVID-19–related anxiety scales measure different latent constructs of anxiety. Furthermore, all scales showed only small to moderate correlations with trait health anxiety, suggesting that COVID-19–related anxiety is distinct from general health anxiety. The adapted “disease anxiety” subscale of the Pandemic Anxiety Scale is an economical measure for assessing COVID-19–related anxiety in parents. Directions for future research are outlined.","Kubb, Christian; Foran, Heather M",JMIR Ment Health,https://doi.org/10.2196/24507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197233/,311
605483,Smoking is associated with worse outcomes of COVID-19 particularly among younger adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-09-23,"Viral genetic variants are widely known to influence disease progression among infected humans. Given the recent and rapid emergence of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cause of COVID-19 disease, viral protein variants have attracted research interest. However, little has yet been written about genetic risk factors among human hosts. Human genetic variation has proven to affect disease progression and outcome for important diseases such as HIV infection and malaria infestation. The fact that the human ACE2 protein is encoded on the X chromosome means that males who carry rare ACE2 coding variants will express those variants in all ACE2-expressing cells, whereas females will typically express those variants in a mosaic distribution determined by early X-inactivation events. This sex-based difference in ACE2 expression has unique implications for epidemiological studies designed to assess host genetic factors influencing progression from asymptomatic SARS-coV-2 infection to COVID-19. Here we present theoretical modelling of rare ACE2 coding variants documented to occur naturally in several human superpopulations and subpopulations, and show that rare variants predicted to affect the binding of ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein exist in people. Though the rs4646116 (p.Lys26Arg) allele is found in 1 in 70 Ashkenazi Jewish males, and in 1 in 172 non-Finnish European males, this allele is found at higher frequencies in females. Furthermore, the class of missense ACE2 alleles predicted to affect SARS-CoV-2 binding are found in aggregate among 1.43% and 2.16% of Ashkenazi males and females, respectively, as well as in 0.58% and 1.24% of European males and females outside of Finland. These alleles are rarer in other population groups, and almost absent from East Asians genotyped to date. Though we are aware that full genome-wide and exome-wide sequencing studies may ultimately be required to assess human genetic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 fully, we argue on the basis of strong prior probabilities that genotyping of this class of alleles is justified in cases of atypical SARS-CoV-2 diseases, such as asymptomatic super-spreaders (if any are identified), and in neonatal/paediatric-onset COVID-19 disease. Even relatively rare susceptibility factors (1% or fewer carriers) may become quantitatively important in the context of hundreds of thousands of infections. A small number of asymptomatic carriers, or a small number of super-spreaders, or a small segment of the population that is disproportionately likely to require intensive care, can magnify the medical, social and economic impacts of a pandemic of this size. The speed of the pandemic and the large number of affected cases worldwide justify efforts to identify all possible risk factors for adverse outcomes, including efforts to identify genetic susceptibility factors in human hosts.","Gibson, William T.; Evans, Daniel M; An, Jianghong; Jones, Steven JM",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.026633,311

607262,RE: Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of COVID-19-Infected Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2021,"Advances in the next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have significantly increased our ability to detect new viral pathogens and systematically determine the spectrum of viruses prevalent in various biological samples. In addition, this approach has also helped in establishing the associations of viromes with many diseases. However, unlike the metagenomic studies using 16S rRNA for the detection of bacteria, it is impossible to create universal oligonucleotides to target all known and novel viruses, owing to their genomic diversity and variability. On the other hand, sequencing the entire genome is still expensive and has relatively low sensitivity for such applications. The existing approaches for the design of oligonucleotides for targeted enrichment are usually involved in the development of primers for the PCR-based detection of particular viral species or genera, but not for families or higher taxonomic orders. In this study, we have developed a computational pipeline for designing the oligonucleotides capable of covering a significant number of known viruses within various taxonomic orders, as well as their novel variants. We have subsequently designed a genus-specific oligonucleotide panel for targeted enrichment of viral nucleic acids in biological material and demonstrated the possibility of its application for virus detection in bird samples. We have tested our panel using a number of collected samples and have observed superior efficiency in the detection and identification of viral pathogens. Since a reliable, bioinformatics-based analytical method for the rapid identification of the sequences was crucial, an NGS-based data analysis module was developed in this study, and its functionality in the detection of novel viruses and analysis of virome diversity was demonstrated.","Ayginin, Andrey A.; Pimkina, Ekaterina V.; Matsvay, Alina D.; Speranskaya, Anna S.; Safonova, Marina V.; Blinova, Ekaterina A.; Artyushin, Ilya V.; Dedkov, Vladimir G.; Shipulin, German A.; Khafizov, Kamil",Adv Virol,https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/3248285; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30158979/,311

608203,"Containment, Contact Tracing and Asymptomatic Transmission of Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): A Modelling Study",2020-09-27,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has left many people isolated within their homes; these people are turning to social media for news and social connection, which leaves them vulnerable to believing and sharing misinformation. Health-related misinformation threatens adherence to public health messaging, and monitoring its spread on social media is critical to understanding the evolution of ideas that have potentially negative public health impacts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to use Twitter data to explore methods to characterize and classify four COVID-19 conspiracy theories and to provide context for each of these conspiracy theories through the first 5 months of the pandemic. METHODS: We began with a corpus of COVID-19 tweets (approximately 120 million) spanning late January to early May 2020. We first filtered tweets using regular expressions (n=1.8 million) and used random forest classification models to identify tweets related to four conspiracy theories. Our classified data sets were then used in downstream sentiment analysis and dynamic topic modeling to characterize the linguistic features of COVID-19 conspiracy theories as they evolve over time. RESULTS: Analysis using model-labeled data was beneficial for increasing the proportion of data matching misinformation indicators. Random forest classifier metrics varied across the four conspiracy theories considered (F1 scores between 0.347 and 0.857); this performance increased as the given conspiracy theory was more narrowly defined. We showed that misinformation tweets demonstrate more negative sentiment when compared to nonmisinformation tweets and that theories evolve over time, incorporating details from unrelated conspiracy theories as well as real-world events. CONCLUSIONS: Although we focus here on health-related misinformation, this combination of approaches is not specific to public health and is valuable for characterizing misinformation in general, which is an important first step in creating targeted messaging to counteract its spread. Initial messaging should aim to preempt generalized misinformation before it becomes widespread, while later messaging will need to target evolving conspiracy theories and the new facets of each as they become incorporated.","Gerts, Dax; Shelley, Courtney D; Parikh, Nidhi; Pitts, Travis; Watson Ross, Chrysm; Fairchild, Geoffrey; Vaquera Chavez, Nidia Yadria; Daughton, Ashlynn R",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2196/26527; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33764882/,311

609296,"COVID-19 and Heart Failure: From Epidemiology During the Pandemic to Myocardial Injury, Myocarditis, and Heart Failure Sequelae",2021-08-10,"Starting in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 epidemics quickly propagated worldwide in less than three months, geographically sorting genomic variants in newly established propagules of infections. Stochasticity in transmission within and between countries and/or actual advantage in virus transmissibility could explain the high frequency reached by some genomic variants during the course of the outbreak. Using a suite of statistical, population genetics, and theoretical approaches, we show that the globally most represented spike protein variant (i.e., the G clade, A → G nucleotide change at genomic position 23,403; D → G amino acid change at spike protein position 614) i) underwent a significant demographic expansion in most countries not explained by stochastic effects or enhanced pathogenicity; ii) affects the spike S1/S2 furin-like site increasing its conformational plasticity (short range effect), and iii) modifies the internal motion of the receptor-binding domain affecting its cross-connection with other functional domains (long-range effect). Our study unambiguously links the spread of the G614 with a non-random process, and we hypothesize that this process is related to the selective advantage produced by a specific structural modification of the spike protein. We conclude that the different conformation of the S1/S2 proteolytic site is at the basis of the higher transmission rate of this invasive SARS-CoV-2 variant, and provide structural information to guide the design of selective and efficient drugs.","Trucchi, Emiliano; Gratton, Paolo; Mafessoni, Fabrizio; Motta, Stefano; Cicconardi, Francesco; Bertorelle, Giorgio; D’Annessa, Ilda; Di Marino, Daniele",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.095620,311

However, it is not known whether the prehospital profile of polytrauma patients (PTP) has been affected. OBJECTIVE: To determine differences in the epidemiological characteristics and the clinical variables of prehospital polytrauma patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Catalonia. METHODOLOGY: Analytical cross-sectional study. The number of prehospital activations and the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of polytrauma patients attended by the Emergency Medical System (EMS) of Catalonia, were compared for the period between 15 February and 15 May 2020 and the same period in the previous year.

We propose a deep learning-based cough sound classification model that can distinguish between children with healthy versus pathological coughs such as asthma, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). To train a deep neural network model, we collected a new dataset of cough sounds, labelled with a clinician’s diagnosis. The chosen model is a bidirectional long–short-term memory network (BiLSTM) based on Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) features. The resulting trained model when trained for classifying two classes of coughs—healthy or pathology (in general or belonging to a specific respiratory pathology)—reaches accuracy exceeding 84% when classifying the cough to the label provided by the physicians’ diagnosis. To classify the subject’s respiratory pathology condition, results of multiple cough epochs per subject were combined. The resulting prediction accuracy exceeds 91% for all three respiratory pathologies. However, when the model is trained to classify and discriminate among four classes of coughs, overall accuracy dropped: one class of pathological coughs is often misclassified as the other. However, if one considers the healthy cough classified as healthy and pathological cough classified to have some kind of pathology, then the overall accuracy of the four-class model is above 84%. A longitudinal study of MFCC feature space when comparing pathological and recovered coughs collected from the same subjects revealed the fact that pathological coughs, irrespective of the underlying conditions, occupy the same feature space making it harder to differentiate only using MFCC features.","Balamurali, B T; Hee, Hwan Ing; Kapoor, Saumitra; Teoh, Oon Hoe; Teng, Sung Shin; Lee, Khai Pin; Herremans, Dorien; Chen, Jer Ming",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34450996/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21165555,311

It not only results in severe economic losses but also raises concerns over animal welfare and antimicrobial resistance and remains an important zoonotic agent in some countries. The definition and diagnosis of S. suis-associated diseases can be complex. Should S. suis be considered a primary or secondary pathogen? The situation is further complicated when referring to respiratory disease, since the pathogen has historically been considered as a secondary pathogen within the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). Is S. suis a respiratory or strictly systemic pathogen? S. suis is a normal inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract, and the presence of potentially virulent strains alone does not guarantee the appearance of clinical signs. Within this unclear context, it has been largely proposed that co-infection with some viral and bacterial pathogens can significantly influence the severity of S. suis-associated diseases and may be the key to understanding how the infection behaves in the field. In this review, we critically addressed studies reporting an epidemiological link (mixed infections or presence of more than one pathogen at the same time), as well as in vitro and in vivo studies of co-infection of S. suis with other pathogens and discussed their limitations and possibilities for improvement and proposed recommendations for future studies.","Obradovic, Milan R.; Segura, Mariela; Segalés, Joaquim; Gottschalk, Marcelo",Vet Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-021-00918-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33743838/,311

Although aerosol transmission is possible, direct contact through large droplets is probably responsible for the vast majority of transmissions.[1, 2] This paper is the 2nd of a series of three on the management of COVID-19 in clinical dental care settings and aims to describe PPE selection and use by DCP, with consideration of the level of risk associated with the planned procedures. PPE selection depends directly on the local epidemiological setting, the patient's characteristics, and the level of risk of the planned procedures. The procedures performed in the office environment are classified as low-, moderate-, or high-risk. Moderate risk includes two further sublevels associated with the cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of materials for clinical procedures that do not generate aerosols. The training of DCP on how to properly don (put on) and doff (remove) PPE is as important as choosing the appropriate PPE since it can be associated with a risk of infection. When there is limited availability of PPE, measures should be adjusted to the risk associated with the intervention. Assuming that an effective vaccine will be developed, once it becomes available for DCP, PPE requirements will likely be different. The proper use of PPE, together with the adoption of other operational procedures, can provide effective protection against microorganisms being transmitted via body fluids or in the air","Melo, Paulo; Afonso, Americo; Monteiro, Luis; Lopes, Otilia; Alves, Ricardo Castro",Int Dent J,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.identj.2021.01.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33531145/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0020653921000071; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020653921000071?v=s5,311
611321,Increasing severity of COVID-19 in pregnancy with Delta (B.1.617.2) variant surge,2021-09-14,"BACKGROUND: Critical knowledge of what we know about health and disease, risk factors, causation, prevention, and treatment, derives from epidemiology. Unfortunately, its methods and language can be misused and improperly applied. A repertoire of methods, techniques, arguments, and tactics are used by some people to manipulate science, usually in the service of powerful interests, and particularly those with a financial stake related to toxic agents. Such interests work to foment uncertainty, cast doubt, and mislead decision makers by seeding confusion about cause-and-effect relating to population health. We have compiled a toolkit of the methods used by those whose interests are not aligned with the public health sciences. Professional epidemiologists, as well as those who rely on their work, will thereby be more readily equipped to detect bias and flaws resulting from financial conflict-of-interest, improper study design, data collection, analysis, or interpretation, bringing greater clarity—not only to the advancement of knowledge, but, more immediately, to policy debates. METHODS: The summary of techniques used to manipulate epidemiological findings, compiled as part of the 2020 Position Statement of the International Network for Epidemiology in Policy (INEP) entitled Conflict-of-Interest and Disclosure in Epidemiology, has been expanded and further elucidated in this commentary. RESULTS: Some level of uncertainty is inherent in science. However, corrupted and incomplete literature contributes to confuse, foment further uncertainty, and cast doubt about the evidence under consideration. Confusion delays scientific advancement and leads to the inability of policymakers to make changes that, if enacted, would—supported by the body of valid evidence—protect, maintain, and improve public health. An accessible toolkit is provided that brings attention to the misuse of the methods of epidemiology. Its usefulness is as a compendium of what those trained in epidemiology, as well as those reviewing epidemiological studies, should identify methodologically when assessing the transparency and validity of any epidemiological inquiry, evaluation, or argument. The problems resulting from financial conflicting interests and the misuse of scientific methods, in conjunction with the strategies that can be used to safeguard public health against them, apply not only to epidemiologists, but also to other public health professionals. CONCLUSIONS: This novel toolkit is for use in protecting the public. It is provided to assist public health professionals as gatekeepers of their respective specialty and subspecialty disciplines whose mission includes protecting, maintaining, and improving the public’s health.

The emergence of symptoms in the model reflects the statistics of a nation-wide highly detailed database consisting of more than 62000 cases (about a half of the confirmed by RT-PCR tests) with recorded symptoms in Argentina. The stochastic model displays several of the characteristics of COVID-19 such as a high variability in the evolution of the outbreaks, including long periods in which they run undetected, spontaneous extinction followed by a late outbreak and unimodal as well as bimodal progressions of daily counts of cases (second waves without ad-hoc hypothesis). We show how the relation between undetected cases (including the 'asymptomatic' cases) and detected cases changes as a function of the public policies, the efficiency of the implementation and the timing with respect to the development of the outbreak. We show also that the relation between detected cases and total cases strongly depends on the implemented policies and that detected cases cannot be regarded as a measure of the outbreak, being the dependency between total cases and detected cases in general not monotonic as a function of the efficiency in the intervention method. According to the model, it is possible to control an outbreak with interventions based on the detection of symptoms only in the case when the presence of just one symptom prompts isolation and the detection efficiency reaches about 80% of the cases. Requesting two symptoms to trigger intervention can be enough to fail in the goals.","Solari, H. G.; Natiello, M.

Much has been said and written about it in terms of its nature, mode of infection, the ethics, the harm and, of course, the best resource allocation and triaging paradigm. While offering theoretical explanation of why we need to make a distinction between harms in and of COVID-19, this paper, at the same time, exposes the harms in and of COVID-19, as well as offer examples of where both forms could be seen, using three spheres of reality, namely economy, education, and reproductive rights (abortion). Whereas it notes that harms in COVID-19 are those harms that are inherent in it and are direct vis-à-vis its victims, the paper observes that harms of COVID-19 are those harms that are causally, but only indirectly related to COVID-19. It concludes that knowledge of the distinction between harms in and of COVID-19 will be of use to the masses across the globe in checkmating the antics of those state actors in their respective jurisdictions who may wish to hide under the guise of combating the spread and menace of COVID-19 to carry out some hidden, selfish and vindictive agenda.","Asogwa, Nicholas Uchechukwu",Developing world bioethics,https://doi.org/10.1111/dewb.12335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34529325/,311

At the same time, several high throughput screenings of drugs have been reported to inhibit the viral components during the early course of infection but with little proven efficacies. Here, we investigate the drug repurposing strategies to counteract the coronavirus infection which involves several potential targetable host proteins involved in viral replication and disease progression. We report the high throughput analysis of literature-derived repurposing drug candidates that can be used to target the genetic regulators known to interact with viral proteins based on experimental and interactome studies. In this work we have performed integrated molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy calculations through an expedite in silico process where the number of screened candidates reduces sequentially at every step based on physicochemical interactions. We elucidate that in addition to the pre-clinical and FDA approved drugs that targets specific regulatory proteins, a range of chemical compounds (Nafamostat, Chloramphenicol, Ponatinib) binds to the other gene transcription and translation regulatory proteins with higher affinity and may harbour potential for therapeutic uses. There is a rapid growing interest in the development of combination therapy for COVID-19 to target multiple enzymes/pathways.

In addition, we aimed to learn the thoughts of the students about the virus due to the uncertainties. METHODS: The study was carried out online between April 30, May 5, 2020 with a questionnaire prepared with googleforms. For the study, all students studying at the Faculty of Medicine of Istanbul Yeni Yüzyıl University were called through class representatives and WhatsApp class groups. The questionnaire included sociodemographic information, knowledge and sources of information about the disease, to agreement degree the proposition whether covid 19 is produced as a biological weapon. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) were applied. RESULTS: The total number of participants was 275 students. No student was infected with COVID-19 at the time of the survey. The presence of chronic disease in the participants was found to be a factor that increased anxiety (p = 0.01). Majority of participants (60.40%) stated that they agree with COVID-19 is a biological weapon. The mean scores of women ‘s total PSS and IES-R were higher than men. It was found that the families of the students had a lower monthly income than the minimum monthly wage is increasing the anxiety about getting COVID-19 infection and perceived stress. One-third of the students reported that sleep and appetite were impaired than the before pandemic. The announcements and website of Ministry of Health and the social media was the main source of information of the participants.

RESULTS: Older adults reported higher depression and greater loneliness following the onset of the pandemic. Loneliness positively predicted depression. Perceived relationship strength, but not social engagement, moderated this relationship such that loneliness only predicted depression for individuals who became closer to their networks during the pandemic. For those who felt less close, depression was higher irrespective of loneliness.

While research to deliver vaccines and antivirals are being pursued, various effective technologies to control its environmental spread are also being targeted. Ultraviolet light (UV-C) technologies are effective against a broad spectrum of microorganisms when used even on large surface areas. In this study, we developed a pyrimidine dinucleotide frequency based genomic model to predict the sensitivity of select enveloped and non-enveloped viruses to UV-C treatments in order to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 and human noroviruses surrogates. The results revealed that this model was best fitted using linear regression with r2=0.90. The predicted UV-C sensitivity (D90 - dose for 90% inactivation) for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV was found to be 21 and 28 J/m2, respectively (with an estimated 18 J/m2 as published for SARS-CoV-1), suggesting that coronaviruses are highly sensitive to UV-C light compared to other ssRNA viruses used in this modeling study. Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 strain with a D90 of 21 J/m2 close to that of SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a suitable surrogate to validate SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by UV-C treatment. Furthermore, the non-enveloped human noroviruses (HuNoVs), had predicted D90 values of 69.1, 89 and 77.6 J/m2 for genogroups GI, GII and GIV, respectively. Murine norovirus (MNV-1) of GV with a D90 = 100 J/m2 was identified as a potential conservative surrogate for UV-C inactivation of these HuNoVs. This study provides useful insights for the identification of potential nonpathogenic surrogates to understand inactivation kinetics and their use in experimental validation of UV-C disinfection systems. This approach can be used to narrow the number of surrogates used in testing UV-C inactivation of other human and animal ssRNA viral pathogens for experimental validation that can save cost, labor and time.","Pendyala, Brahmaiah; Patras, Ankit; D’Souza, Doris",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.14.151290,311

Understanding the behavioral effects of testing availability may provide insight into the role of adequate testing on controlling viral transmission. Objective: To evaluate the impact of testing availability on behavioral intention to self-isolate in a simulated scenario with participants who have been clinically diagnosed with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 1400 participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) through a national, online, opt-in survey. Participants were randomized to one of three hypothetical scenarios. Each scenario asked participants to imagine having symptoms consistent with COVID-19 along with a clinical diagnosis from their physician. However, scenarios differed in their testing result: testing unavailable, positive test, or negative test. The primary outcome was intention to engage in high-risk COVID-19 behaviors, measured using an 11-item mean score (range 1-7) that was pre-registered prior to data collection. The randomized survey was conducted between July 23rd to July 29th, 2020. Results: Out of 1194 respondents (41.6% male, 58.4% female) with a median age of 38.5 years, participants who had no testing available in their clinical scenario showed significantly greater intentions to engage in behavior facilitating COVID-19 transmission compared to those who received a positive confirmatory test result scenario (difference (SE): 0.14 (0.06), P=0.016), equating to an 11.1% increase in mean score risky behavior intentions. Intention to engage in behaviors that can spread COVID-19 were also positively associated with male gender, poor health status, and Republican party affiliation. Conclusion: Testing availability appears to play an independent role in influencing behaviors facilitating COVID-19 transmission.

However in the context of limited vaccine supply and an expanding pandemic, policymakers are considering single-dose vaccination as an alternative strategy. Using a mathematical model combined with optimization algorithms, we determined the optimal allocation with one and two doses of vaccine to minimize five metrics of disease burden under various degrees of viral transmission. Under low transmission, we show that the optimal allocation of vaccine critically depends on the level of single-dose efficacy (SDE). If the SDE is high, single-dose vaccination is optimal, preventing up to 36% more deaths than a strategy prioritizing full-dose vaccination for older adults first. With low or moderate SDE, mixed vaccination campaigns with coverage of all older adults with one dose are optimal. However, with modest or high transmission, vaccinating older adults first with two doses is best, preventing up to 41% more deaths than a single-dose vaccination given across all populations. Further, we show that maintaining social distancing interventions and speedy deployment are key for effective vaccination campaigns. Our work suggests that it is imperative to determine the efficacy and durability of single-dose vaccines, as mixed or single-dose vaccination campaigns may have the potential to contain the pandemic much more quickly.","Matrajt, Laura; Eaton, Julia; Leung, Tiffany; Dimitrov, Dobromir; Schiffer, Joshua T.; Swan, David A.; Janes, Holly",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33469590/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.31.20249099; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20249099v1?rss=1,311

However, the mental health status and quality of life (QOL) in CC have not been adequately examined. This study examined the mental health status and QOL in CC during the post-COVID-19 period. This cross-sectional study comprised 1169 CC and 1290 who were non-close contacts (non-CC). Demographic data were collected; depression, fatigue, post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and QOL were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 items (PHQ-9), fatigue numeric rating scale, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - 17 items (PCL-17), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire - brief version (WHOQOL-BREF), respectively. Analysis of covariance was used to compare depressive symptoms, QOL, fatigue, and PTSS between the CC and non-CC groups. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the independent correlates for depression, fatigue, PTSS, and QOL in the CC group. Compared to the non-CC group, the CC group reported significantly more severe depression (F((1, 2458)) = 5.58, p = 0.018) and fatigue (F((1, 2458)) = 9.22, p = 0.002) in the post-COVID-19 period. No significant differences in PTSS and QOL between the CC and non-CC groups were found (F((1, 2458)) = 2.93, p = 0.087 for PTSS; F((1, 2458)) = 3.45, p = 0.064 for QOL). In the CC group, younger age, financial loss due to COVID-19, and perception of poor or fair health status were significantly associated with depression and fatigue, while frequent use of mass media was significantly associated with fatigue. In conclusion, close contacts of COVID-19 patients experienced high levels of depression and fatigue in the post-COVID-19 period.

ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) has been shown to be one of the major receptors that mediate the entry of 2019-nCoV into human cells, which also happens in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). Several researches have indicated that some patients have abnormal renal function or even kidney damage in addition to injury in respiratory system, and the related mechanism is unknown. This arouses our interest in whether coronavirus infection will affect the urinary and male reproductive systems. Here in this study, we used the online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs. The results indicate that ACE2 highly expresses in renal tubular cells, Leydig cells and cells in seminiferous ducts in testis. Therefore, virus might directly bind to such ACE2 positive cells and damage the kidney and testicular tissue of patients. Our results indicate that renal function evaluation and special care should be performed in 2019-nCoV patients during clinical work, because of the kidney damage caused by virus and antiviral drugs with certain renal toxicity.

However, their use in patients requires large-scale expansion systems while maintaining the quality of the cells. Due to their characteristics, bioreactors have been regarded as ideal platforms to harbour stem cell biomanufacturing at a large scale. Specifically, single-use bioreactors have been recommended by regulatory agencies due to reducing the risk of product contamination, and many different systems have already been developed. This review describes single-use bioreactor platforms which have been used for human stem cell expansion and differentiation, along with their comparison with reusable systems in the development of a stem cell bioprocess for clinical applications.","Nogueira, Diogo E.S.; Cabral, Joaquim M.S.; Rodrigues, Carlos A.V.",Bioengineering (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering8050068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34067549/,311

Expansion of the pandemic will be expedited by factors such as an abundance of at-risk populations, inadequate COVID-19 mitigation efforts, sheer inability to comply with community mitigation strategies, and constrained national preparedness. This situation will reduce the benefits achieved through decades of disease control and health promotion measures, and the economic progress made during periods of global development. Without interventions, and as soon as international travel and trade resume, reservoirs of COVID-19 and other vaccine-preventable diseases in LDFCAC will continue ‘feeding’ developed countries with repeated infection seeds. Assuring LDFCAC equity in access to medical countermeasures, funds to mitigate the pandemic, and a paradigm change in the global development agenda, similar to the post-World War II Marshall Plan for Europe, are urgently needed. We argue for a paradigm change in strategy, including a new global pandemic financing mechanism for COVID-19 and other future pandemics. This approach should assist LDFCAC in gaining access to and membership of a global interdisciplinary pandemic taskforce to enable in-country plans to train, leverage, and maintain essential functioning and also to utilize and enhance surveillance and early detection capabilities. Such a task force will be able to build on and expand research into the management of pandemics, protect vulnerable populations through international laws/treaties, and reinforce and align the development agenda to prevent and mitigate future pandemics. Lifting LDFCAC from COVID-related failure will offer the global community the best economic dividends of the century.","Ebrahim, Shahul H.; Gozzer, Ernesto; Ahmed, Yusuf; Imtiaz, Rubina; Ditekemena, John; Rahman, N.M.

Mucosal vaccination has been interested in many researchers because mucosal immune responses play part in the first line of defense against pathogens. However, mucosal vaccination should find out an efficient antigen delivery system because the antigen should be protected from degradation and clearance, it should be targeted to mucosal sites, and it should stimulate mucosal and systemic immunity. Accordingly, mucoadhesive polymeric particles among the polymeric particles have gained much attention because they can protect the antigen from degradation, prolong the residence time of the antigen at the target site, and control the release of the loaded vaccine, and results in induction of mucosal and systemic immune responses. In this review, we discuss advances in the development of several kinds of mucoadhesive polymeric particles for mucosal vaccine delivery.","Cho, Chong-Su; Hwang, Soo-Kyung; Gu, Min-Jeong; Kim, Cheol-Gyun; Kim, Seo-Kyung; Ju, Do-Bin; Yun, Cheol-Heui; Kim, Hyun-Joong",Tissue Eng Regen Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34304387/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13770-021-00373-w,311

Asthma is the most common preexisting medical disorder encountered in pregnancy, and its prevalence in women of childbearing age is increasing. There is a slight increase in the risk to the pregnancy, but suboptimal therapy is the most common reason for poor control. X-rays should be obtained whenever clinically indicated, and most drugs used in the management of asthma have a long track record of safety. For women with poor control in pregnancy, there should be good liaison between the respiratory physician and the obstetrician.

The simple and painless process of saliva collection allows for widespread testing, but enthusiasm is hampered by variable performance compared to that of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. We prospectively collected paired NPS and saliva samples from a total of 300 unique adult and pediatric patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 32.2% (97/300) of the individuals using the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kit (Thermo Fisher). Performance of saliva and NPS was compared against the total number of positives regardless of specimen type. The overall concordances for saliva and NPS were 91.0% (273/300) and 94.7% (284/300), respectively. The values for positive percent agreement (PPA) for saliva and NPS were 81.4% (79/97) and 89.7% (87/97), respectively. Saliva yielded detection of 10 positive cases that were negative by NPS. For symptomatic and asymptomatic pediatric patients not previously diagnosed with COVID-19, the performances of saliva and NPS were comparable (PPA, 82.4% versus 85.3%). The overall values for PPA for adults were 83.3% and 90.7% for saliva and NPS, respectively, with saliva yielding detection of 4 fewer cases than NPS. However, saliva performance for symptomatic adults was identical to NPS performance (PPA of 93.8%). With lower cost and self-collection capabilities, saliva can be an appropriate sample choice alternative to NPS for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adults.","Yee, Rebecca; Truong, Thao T.; Pannaraj, Pia S.; Eubanks, Natalie; Gai, Emily; Jumarang, Jaycee; Turner, Lauren; Peralta, Ariana; Lee, Yesun; Dien Bard, Jennifer",J Clin Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.02686-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33239380/,311

Here, we looked at the effects of geographic differences on clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. METHODS: A total of 114 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in this study. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, as well as laboratory findings were extracted from the electronic medical records of these patients. RESULTS: We report the observation that patients from overseas residents diagnosed with COVID-19 were mildly symptomatic with cough and presented with lower inflammatory response and attenuated virus clearance rate, as well as correspondingly prolonged days of hospital stay than local Chinese patients. Moreover, the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, performed to provide a measure of the difference between two groups, showed that serum albumin had the highest area under the curve value (0.81, p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Our results suggested that blood albumin level acted as a predictive value in distinguishing clinical features between local and overseas Chinese. This work underscores the need to identify distinguishably prognostic factors of geographical dissimilarity in COVID-19 patients.","Liang, Yanhua; Kou, Shanglong; Li, Xiaohe; Ke, Zhiyi; Zou, Rongrong; Pan, Yanchao; Yuan, Jing",Infect Drug Resist,https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s307238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34168467/,311
625757,Influence of vitamin D status on hospital length of stay and prognosis in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19: a multicenter prospective cohort study,2021-05-21,"ABSTRACT: This study aims to identify issues plaguing rural India's water supply chain and present a general methodology for the implementation of an IoT-based water distribution and management system in a rural setting. Through the literature review, significant hurdles in the water supply chain of rural India, as well as the potential role of IoT in water supply chain management, were recognized. An implementation plan was proposed to design an IoT-based water distribution and management system with the help of flow meters, ultrasonic sensors, motors, etc. Also, the feasibility of such a system was explored with the help of a use case. This study highlighted that one of the most significant reasons for water scarcity in rural India is the lack of proper infrastructure leading to water resources mismanagement. In the context of our use case, despite adequate availability of physical water for consumption, by the time water is delivered to the consumers, a significant amount of it is wasted due to the lack of an efficient water management system. It was determined that the investment return for the proposed system would break even within three months of installment. This study's results are based on inputs from governmental data collected in the Census report of 2011. As such, the ground level scenario is bound to be comparatively different today. This study is anticipated to guide governmental organizations and policymakers in the formulation of new strategies.

626538,"Identify the Risk Factors of COVID-19-Related Acute Kidney Injury: A Single-Center, Retrospective Cohort Study",2020-07-28,"SARS-CoV-2 is associated with new-onset neurological and psychiatric conditions. Detailed clinical data, including factors associated with recovery, are lacking, hampering prediction modelling and targeted therapeutic interventions. In a UK-wide cross-sectional surveillance study of adult hospitalized patients during the first COVID-19 wave, with multi-professional input from general and sub-specialty neurologists, psychiatrists, stroke physicians, and intensivists, we captured detailed data on demographics, risk factors, pre-COVID-19 Rockwood frailty score, comorbidities, neurological presentation and outcome. A priori clinical case definitions were used, with cross-specialty independent adjudication for discrepant cases. Multivariable logistic regression was performed using demographic and clinical variables, to determine the factors associated with outcome. A total of 267 cases were included. Cerebrovascular events were most frequently reported (131, 49%), followed by other central disorders (95, 36%) including delirium (28, 11%), central inflammatory (25, 9%), psychiatric (25, 9%), and other encephalopathies (17, 7%), including a severe encephalopathy (n = 13) not meeting delirium criteria; and peripheral nerve disorders (41, 15%). Those with the severe encephalopathy, in comparison to delirium, were younger, had higher rates of admission to intensive care and a longer duration of ventilation. Compared to normative data during the equivalent time period prior to the pandemic, cases of stroke in association with COVID-19 were younger and had a greater number of conventional, modifiable cerebrovascular risk factors. Twenty-seven per cent of strokes occurred in patients <60 years. Relative to those >60 years old, the younger stroke patients presented with delayed onset from respiratory symptoms, higher rates of multi-vessel occlusion (31%) and systemic thrombotic events. Clinical outcomes varied between disease groups, with cerebrovascular disease conferring the worst prognosis, but this effect was less marked than the pre-morbid factors of older age and a higher pre-COVID-19 frailty score, and a high admission white cell count, which were independently associated with a poor outcome. In summary, this study describes the spectrum of neurological and psychiatric conditions associated with COVID-19. In addition, we identify a severe COVID-19 encephalopathy atypical for delirium, and a phenotype of COVID-19 associated stroke in younger adults with a tendency for multiple infarcts and systemic thromboses. These clinical data will be useful to inform mechanistic studies and stratification of patients in clinical trials.","Ross Russell, Amy L; Hardwick, Marc; Jeyanantham, Athavan; White, Laura M; Deb, Saumitro; Burnside, Girvan; Joy, Harriet M; Smith, Craig J; Pollak, Thomas A; Nicholson, Timothy R; Davies, Nicholas W S; Manji, Hadi; Easton, Ava; Ray, Stephen; Zandi, Michael S; Coles, Jonathan P; Menon, David K; Varatharaj, Aravinthan; McCausland, Beth; Ellul, Mark A; Thomas, Naomi; Breen, Gerome; Keddie, Stephen; Lunn, Michael P; Burn, John P S; Quattrocchi, Graziella; Dixon, Luke; Rice, Claire M; Pengas, George; Al-Shahi Salman, Rustam; Carson, Alan; Joyce, Eileen M; Turner, Martin R; Benjamin, Laura A; Solomon, Tom; Kneen, Rachel; Pett, Sarah; Thomas, Rhys H; Michael, Benedict D; Galea, Ian",Brain Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34409289/; https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcab168,311

Evidence increasingly suggests that the symptoms of coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19)‐related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) differ from those of classic ARDS. Recently, the severity of COVID‐19 has been attributed to a systemic, thrombotic, and inflammatory disease that damages not only the lungs but multiple organs, including the heart, brain, toes, and liver. This systemic form of COVID‐19 may be due to inflammation and vascular endothelial cell injury. The vascular endothelial glycocalyx comprises glycoproteins, and plays an important role in systemic capillary homeostasis maintenance. The glycocalyx covers the entire vascular endothelium, and its thickness varies among organs. The endothelial glycocalyx is very thin in the pulmonary capillaries, where it is affected by gaseous exchange with the alveoli and the low intravascular pressure in the pulmonary circulation. Despite the clearly important roles of the glycocalyx in vascular endothelial injury, thrombosis, vasculitis, and inflammation, the link between this structure and vascular endothelial cell dysfunction in COVID‐19 remains unclear. In this prospective review, we summarize the importance of the glycocalyx and its potential as a therapeutic target in cases of systemic COVID‐19.","Okada, Hideshi; Yoshida, Shozo; Hara, Akira; Ogura, Shinji; Tomita, Hiroyuki",Microcirculation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32791568/; https://doi.org/10.1111/micc.12654,311

Considering the worldwide cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it remains a pandemic and the vaccines and therapeutic agents have yet to be developed to stop the spread of this outbreak. Due to the unavailability of specific treatment for the COVID-19, it can be viewed that the risk of cluster infection will continue to be present within the intermittent and small-scale outbreaks. Though the COVID-19 has been identified as a communicable disease, the preventive measures and response policies in South Korea are effectively serving the purpose and gained the confidence to overcome the COVID-19 crisis. This paper includes the exploratory data analysis of COVID-19 cases in South Korea till July 8, 2020. South Korea has reported the lowest death rate with the majority of the deaths, associated with persons with underlying health conditions or elderly infected individuals. Currently the infected patients (total 989) remaining in South Korea are mild cases owing to its robust health care system and quarantine inspection procedures followed by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of South Korea to flatten the COVID-19 curve. Although the COVID-19 countermeasures taken by the South Korean government may not be conclusive or universal for all, but its exemplary approach to tackle COVID-19 can aid countries across the globe to strengthen their response system for the future outbreak of such an infectious disease.

This study with a large sample aimed to give insights into the impact of personality on pandemic fear and behavior by investigating the Big Five traits, COVID-19-fear, and associated behavioral changes in a large German-speaking sample. Methods: About 14,048 healthy respondents (65.5% female, 34.2% male, and 0.32% other gender/gender queer; range = 18–85 years, median age 35–44 years) participated in the survey during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two scales, “adherent” safety behavior (ASB, α = 0.857) and “dysfunctional” safety behavior (DSB, α = 0.876), three items each, measured pandemic-associated behavior. The Big Five Inventory-10 (BFI-10) tested personality traits. Results: While ASB correlated negatively with extraversion (rho = −0.053, ≤ 0.001), the other four traits were positively associated, with the highest association for neuroticism (rho = 0.116, ≤ 0.001), whereas neuroticism showed a positive correlation (rho = 0.142, ≤ 0.001) with DSB, extraversion (rho = −0.042, ≤ 0.001), agreeableness (rho = −0.028, ≤ 0.001), and conscientiousness (rho = −0.025, ≤ 0.001) correlated negatively with it. Regression analyses showed a small extent of the effect of personality traits. Moreover, neuroticism mediated the association between COVID-19-fear and DSB (positive-directed). Conclusions: Even though our results on correlations between personality, pandemic fear, and related behavior are in line with the existing literature studies, the analyses clearly show that the impact of personality traits, including neuroticism, on pandemic behavior is very small. Rather, pandemic fear has a much larger influence on the safety behavior mediated through neuroticism. Further studies should bear in mind that personality traits can not only have influencing effects but also mediating effects.","Fink, Madeleine; Bäuerle, Alexander; Schmidt, Kira; Rheindorf, Nadine; Musche, Venja; Dinse, Hannah; Moradian, Sheila; Weismüller, Benjamin; Schweda, Adam; Teufel, Martin; Skoda, Eva-Maria",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34421728/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.671768,311

METHODS AND MATERIALS: All RO residency programs affiliated with a US medical school were asked to participate in the study survey. An optional and anonymous survey consisting of twelve questions was emailed to all graduating medical students in 2020 at the twelve allopathic medical schools that agreed to survey administration. Survey responses were collected from March to May 2020. RESULTS: The study consisted of 265 survey responses out of 1766 distributed to eligible medical students, resulting in a response rate of 15.0%. The majority of students reported no exposure to RO (60.8%) and never considered it as a career option (63.8%). Neutral perceptions of the field were more common (54.3%) than positive (39.6%) and negative (6.0%). The top factors attracting medical students to RO were perceptions of high salary, favorable lifestyle and workload, and technological focus. The top negative factors were the field’s interplay with physics, competitive USMLE board scores for matched applicants, and the focus placed on research during medical school. In the subgroup of students who were interested in RO but ultimately applied to another specialty, the job market was the most salient concern. CONCLUSIONS: Finding a place for RO in medical school curricula remains to be a challenge with most surveyed students reporting no exposure during their education. Concern over the job market was the primary deterrent for medical students interested in pursuing RO. For disinterested students who had not considered RO as a career option, the required physics knowledge was the main deterrent.","Wu, Trudy C.; McCloskey, Susan A.; Wallner, Paul E.; Steinberg, Michael L.; Raldow, Ann C.",Adv Radiat Oncol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452109420302992; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452109420302992?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33102934/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.10.010,311

Pathogenically, it is associated with immune-mediated post-infectious hyperinflammation leading to short-term myocardial injury with yet unknown long-term outcome. We herein present three cases of PIMS-TS treated in our institution with divided doses of immunoglobulins and high dose acetyl salicylic acid, according to existing Kawasaki disease guidelines. Due to greater weight in adolescents affected and concerns of rheological sequelae following possible hyperviscosity, doses of immunoglobulins were divided and given 24 h apart with good tolerability. All patients recovered rapidly with normalization of previously encountered cardiac manifestations. As diagnosis of PIMS-TS should be made promptly, timing of therapy is of paramount importance for a favorable outcome. To date, no randomized controlled trial data exist concerning treatment recommendations. 1.8% (95% CI: 1.7% to 2.0%) of all children and adolescents in the county district of Ostallgäu were tested positive for SARS CoV-2, incidence of PIMS-TS was 1.7% (95% CI: 0.9% to 3.1%) among SARS CoV-2 positive tested earlier.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) re-emerged globally in 2013 in many important swine-producing countries in Asia and the Americas. Several studies have identified the risk factors for the spread of PEDV in acute outbreaks. However, limited information is available on the risk factors for the transmission of PEDV in endemic regions. We hypothesized that poor biosecurity, location, and some social or cultural practices are the main risk factors for PEDV transmission in the Vietnamese pig population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential risk factors for the transmission of PEDV in an endemic area in Vietnam. In this case–control study, questionnaires containing 51 questions were completed for 92 PEDV-positive and 95 PEDV-negative farms. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the risk factors associated with PEDV infection. Province and the total number of pigs were included as random effects to determine their influence on the risk of PEDV infection. Twenty-nine variables of interest that have been associated with PEDV status were analyzed in a univariate analysis (P <0.20), with backward stepwise selection. Only three of these 29 variables in four models remained significant PEDV risk factors in the final model: farrow-to-wean production type, distance from the farm to the slaughterhouse (<1,000 m), and the presence of chickens on site (P <0.05). This is the first study to identify the main risk factors for PEDV infection in an endemic area. Our findings suggest that hygiene measures should be strictly implemented on farms for the effective control and prevention of PEDV infection.","Mai, Thi Ngan; Bui, Thanh Phong; Huynh, Thi My Le; Sasaki, Yosuke; Mitoma, Shuya; Daous, Hala El; Fahkrajang, Watcharapong; Norimine, Junzo; Sekiguchi, Satoshi",Front Vet Sci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.00433; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32851018/,311

We compared by race the risk of 4 COVID-19 health outcomes––maximum length of hospital stay (LOS), invasive ventilation, hospitalization exceeding 24 h, and death––stratified by Elixhauser comorbidity index (ECI) ranking. Outcomes and ECI scores were constructed from retrospective data obtained from the Cerner COVID-19 De-Identified Data cohort. We hypothesized that racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes would exist despite comparable ECI scores among non-Hispanic (NH) Blacks, Hispanics, American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs), and NH Whites. Compared with NH Whites, NH Blacks had longer hospital LOS, higher rates of ventilator dependence, and a higher mortality rate; AI/ANs, higher odds of hospitalization for ECI = 0 but lower for ECI ≥ 5, longer LOS for ECI = 0, a higher risk of death across all ECI categories except ECI ≥ 5, and higher odds of ventilator dependence; Hispanics, a lower risk of death across all ECI categories except ECI = 0, lower odds of hospitalization, shorter LOS for ECI ≥ 5, and higher odds of ventilator dependence for ECI = 0 but lower for ECI = 1–4.

630432,Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19 and Diabetic Kidney Disease,2021-07-30,"Introduction: In order to promote training and further education on topics related to the digitization of medicine, the HiGHmeducation consortium is developing online learning modules. These modules could also be offered across locations. For students of human medicine, an elective for the acquisition of data literacy has been implemented. Originally designed as a blended learning offer, the elective was then carried out completely online due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite the lack of classroom teaching, the aim was to achieve intensive cooperation between the students. Project description: In the elective, the students worked on a total of 14 learning tasks, so-called e-tivities, which stimulate collaborative work and thus promote the examination of the learning content. These asynchronous learning activities were supplemented by video conferences, in which the students also took on the role of presenters. The teachers accompanied this learning process as e-moderators. Results: In April/May 2020, the elective course was carried out with 12 students entirely online. Despite a workload that was experienced as high, the elective was rated very well by the students. Discussion: The didactic concept of the elective enabled an active engagement with the learning material and the social interaction between the learners. With the digital learning offers, the learners were able to gain new experiences which are also of professional relevance. Conclusion: The didactic concept of the elective can be transferred to other courses. Future studies must show which long-term learning effects can be generated by digital teaching based on teamwork, communication and exchange.","Behrends, Marianne; Hoffmann, Ina; Marschollek, Michael",GMS J Med Educ,https://doi.org/10.3205/zma001379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33364365/,311
631756,"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 1663 hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a single-center experience",2020-07-17,"Here, we screened steroid compounds to obtain a drug expected to block host inflammatory responses and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) replication. Ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed the replication of MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in cultured cells. The 90% effective concentration (EC(90)) of ciclesonide for SARS-CoV-2 in differentiated human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells was 0.55 μM. Eight consecutive passages of 43 SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the presence of ciclesonide generated 15 resistant mutants harboring single amino acid substitutions in nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) or nsp4. Of note, ciclesonide suppressed the replication of all these mutants by 90% or more, suggesting that these mutants cannot completely overcome ciclesonide blockade. Under a microscope, the viral RNA replication-transcription complex in cells, which is thought to be detectable using antibodies specific for nsp3 and double-stranded RNA, was observed to fall in the presence of ciclesonide in a concentration-dependent manner. These observations indicate that the suppressive effect of ciclesonide on viral replication is specific to coronaviruses, highlighting it as a candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is ongoing. New and effective antiviral agents that combat the disease are needed urgently. Here, we found that an inhaled corticosteroid, ciclesonide, suppresses the replication of coronaviruses, including betacoronaviruses (murine hepatitis virus type 2 [MHV-2], MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) and an alphacoronavirus (human coronavirus 229E [HCoV-229E]), in cultured cells. Ciclesonide is safe; indeed, it can be administered to infants at high concentrations. Thus, ciclesonide is expected to be a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is effective against many members of the coronavirus family. It could be prescribed for the treatment of MERS and COVID-19.","Matsuyama, Shutoku; Kawase, Miyuki; Nao, Naganori; Shirato, Kazuya; Ujike, Makoto; Kamitani, Wataru; Shimojima, Masayuki; Fukushi, Shuetsu",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33055254/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01648-20,311

DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey of parents of primary and secondary school-age children. SETTING: Community setting. PARTICIPANTS: 1214 parents of school-age children in the UK. METHODS: An online survey explored the impact of lockdown on the mental health of parents with school-age children, and in particular about feelings of social isolation and loneliness. Associations between the UCLA Three-Item Loneliness Scale (UCLATILS), the Direct Measure of Loneliness (DMOL) and the characteristics of the study participants were assessed using ordinal logistic regression models. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported measures of social isolation and loneliness using UCLATILS and DMOL. RESULTS: Half of respondents felt they lacked companionship, 45% had feelings of being left out, 58% felt isolated and 46% felt lonely during the first 100 days of lockdown. The factors that were associated with higher levels of loneliness on UCLATILS were female gender, parenting a child with special needs, lack of a dedicated space for distance learning, disruption of sleep patterns and low levels of physical activity during the lockdown. Factors associated with a higher DMOL were female gender, single parenting, parenting a child with special needs, unemployment, low physical activity, lack of a dedicated study space and disruption of sleep patterns during the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown has increased feelings of social isolation and loneliness among parents of school-age children. The sustained adoption of two modifiable health-seeking lifestyle behaviours (increased levels of physical activity and the maintenance of good sleep hygiene practices) wmay help reduce feelings of social isolation and loneliness during lockdown.","El-Osta, Austen; Alaa, Aos; Webber, Iman; Riboli Sasco, Eva; Bagkeris, Emmanouil; Millar, Helen; Vidal-Hall, Charlotte; Majeed, Azeem",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043397; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33980516/,311

Lockdown imposes periods of social isolation that contributes to increased levels of stress, anxiety, depression, loneliness, and worry. We examined whether lockdowns have similar psychosocial associations across rural and urban areas and whether associations existed between happiness and worry of loneliness in the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Data were collected using the “COVID-19 Living Survey” between 13 and 20 May 2020 by BehaviourWorks Australia at the Monash Sustainable Development Institute. The mean self-reported feeling of happiness and anxiousness (N = 1593), on a 10-point Likert scale with 0 being least happy or highly anxious, was 6.5 (SD = 2.4) and 3.9 (2.9), respectively. Factors associated with happiness were older age and having a postgraduate education. Participants worried about becoming lonely also exhibited reduced happiness (estimate = −1.58, 95%CI = −1.84–−1.32) and higher anxiousness (2.22, 1.93–2.51) scores, and these conditions remained associated after adjusting for demographics. Interestingly, worry about loneliness was greater in rural areas than in urban communities. The negative impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on rural youth and those less-educated was evident. Participants in rural Australia who were worried about becoming lonely were reportedly less happy than participants in major cities. This dataset provides a better understanding of factors that influence psychological well-being and quality of life in the Australian population and helps to determine whether happiness may be an associative factor that could mitigate self-feelings of anxiety and worry about loneliness.","Isaac, Vivian; Cheng, Teresa; Townsin, Louise; Assareh, Hassan; Li, Amy; McLachlan, Craig S.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574425/,311

The main outcome measure was an item from the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 asking: ‘Over the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by poor appetite or overeating?’. Data on sociodemographic factors, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations with poor appetite or overeating. SETTING: An anonymous online survey available from 3 April to 2 May 2020.

RA is one of the main reasons for work disability and premature retirement, thus substantially increasing social and economic burden. Biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) were shown to be an effective therapy especially in those rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, who did not adequately respond to conventional synthetic DMARD therapy. However, despite the proven efficacy, the high cost of the therapy resulted in limitation of the widespread use and unequal access to the care. The introduction of biosimilars, which are much cheaper relative to original drugs, may facilitate the achievement of the therapy by a much broader spectrum of patients. In this review we present the properties of original biologic agents based on cytokine-targeted (blockers of TNF, IL-6, IL-1, GM-CSF) and cell-targeted therapies (aimed to inhibit T cells and B cells properties) as well as biosimilars used in rheumatology. We also analyze the latest update of bDMARDs’ possible influence on DNA methylation, miRNA expression and histone modification in RA patients, what might be the important factors toward precise and personalized RA treatment. In addition, during the COVID-19 outbreak, we discuss the usage of biologicals in context of effective and safe COVID-19 treatment. Therefore, early diagnosing along with therapeutic intervention based on personalized drugs targeting disease-specific genes is still needed to relieve symptoms and to improve the quality of life of RA patients.","Bonek, Krzysztof; Roszkowski, Leszek; Massalska, Magdalena; Maslinski, Wlodzimierz; Ciechomska, Marzena",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10020323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33557301/,311

We sought to capture and synthesize information about changes to routine immunization programs in response to the pandemic and plans to catch-up any missed immunizations. Methods: Provincial/territorial (P/T) public health leaders were interviewed via teleconference between August-October 2020 to collect information on the following topics: how routine immunization delivery was affected during and after initial lockdown periods, plans to catch-up missed doses, and major challenges and achievements in continuing routine immunization programs. Data were coded and categorized according to common responses and descriptive analysis was performed. Results: Interviews occurred with participants from 11 of 13 P/Ts. School immunization programs were reported to be most negatively affected by the pandemic (n=9). In the early pandemic period, infant, preschool, and maternal/prenatal programs were prioritized, with most P/Ts continuing these services with adaptations for COVID-19. After the initial lockdown period, all routine programs were continuing with adaptations in most P/Ts. Infant, preschool, and school programs were most often targeted for catch-up through measures such as appointment rebooking and making additional clinics and/or providers available. Major challenges included resource limitations (e.g., staff shortages, PPE shortages, limited infrastructure) (n=11), public health restrictions (n=8), and public hesitancy to attend appointments (n=5).

Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, can manifest with flu-like symptoms and can be complicated by severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); however a large percentage of infected individuals do not have symptoms but contribute to the spread of the disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection has become a global public health emergency since no available treatment seems effective and it is hard to manage the several complications caused by an intense release of cytokines. This paper reviews the current options on drugs used to reduce the deadly effects of the cytokine storm.","Mannino, Federica; Bitto, Alessandra; Irrera, Natasha",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.592169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33633566/,311

Moreover, certain biotechnological products (e.g. bovine fetal serum, murine feeder cells) may contain prion particles. Viral and prion contamination of cell cultures and “feeder” cells, which is a common risk in all biotechnological products derived from the cell lines, is the most challenging and potentially serious outcome to address, due to the difficulty involved in virus and prion detection and the potential to cause serious disease in recipients of these cell products. Stem cell banks should introduce adequate quality assurance programs like the microbiological control program and can provide researchers with valuable support in the standardization and safety of procedures and protocols used for the viral and prion testing and in validation programs to assure the quality and safety of the cells.","Cobo, Fernando; Talavera, Paloma; Concha, Ángel",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682205007725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16380145/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682205007725,311

To explore the impacts of the input population and quarantine strategies on the disease variations at different scenarios, four time points were assumed as Feb 6, Feb 16, Feb 24 and Mar 5 2020. The major results suggest that our model can well capture the disease variations with high accuracy. The simulated peak value of the confirmed cases is 1002 at Feb 10, 2020 which is mostly close to the reported number of 1007 at Feb 9, 2020. The disease will become extinction with peak value of 1397 at May 11, 2020. Moreover, the increased numbers of the input population can mainly shorten the disease extinction days and the increased percentages of the exposed individuals of the input population increase the number of cumulative confirmed cases at a small percentage. Increasing the input population and decreasing the quarantine strategy together around the time point of the peak value of the confirmed cases, may lead to the second outbreak.","Hu, Zengyun; Cui, Qianqian; Han, Junmei; Wang, Xia; Sha, Wei E.I.; Teng, Zhidong",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220302265; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32334117/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220302265?v=s5,311
637986,Management of acute kidney injury in patients with COVID-19,2020-05-14,"The current study aimed to verify whether or not passive static stretching affects balance control capacity. Thirty-eight participants (19 women and 19 men) underwent a passive static stretching session, involving the knee extensor/flexor and dorsi/plantarflexor muscles, and a control session (no stretching, CTRL). Before (PRE), immediately after (POST), after 15 (POST(15)) and 30 min (POST(30)) from stretching (or rest in CTRL), balance control was evaluated under static and dynamic conditions, with open/closed eyes, and with/without somatosensory perturbation (foam under the feet). During tests, centre of pressure (CoP) sway area and perimeter and antero-posterior and medio-lateral sway mean speed were computed. Surface electromyography root mean square (sEMG RMS) was calculated from the vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius medialis, and tibialis anterior muscles during MVC and during the balance tests. Hip flexion/extension and dorsi/plantarflexion range of motion (ROM), maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and sEMG RMS during MVC were measured at the same time points. After stretching, ROM increased (≈6.5%; P<0.05), while MVC and sEMG RMS decreased (≈9% and ≈7.5%, respectively; P<0.05). Regardless of the testing condition, CoP sway area and the perimeter remained similar, while antero-posterior and medio-lateral sway mean speed decreased by ≈8% and ≈12%, respectively (P<0.05). sEMG RMS during the balance tests increased in all muscles in POST (≈7%, P<0.05). All variables recovered in POST(30). No changes occurred in CTRL. Passive static stretching did not affect the overall balance control ability. However, greater muscle activation was required to maintain similar CoP sway, thus suggesting a decrease in muscle efficiency.","Coratella, Giuseppe; Longo, Stefano; Rampichini, Susanna; Doria, Christian; Borrelli, Marta; Limonta, Eloisa; Michielon, Giovanni; Cè, Emiliano; Esposito, Fabio",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256656; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34550984/,311

We aimed to investigate the disease status, concerns about management, and psychological stress in SAPHO patients during the COVID-19 epidemic. Method A structured questionnaire was distributed online to patients with SAPHO syndrome enrolled in a Chinese cohort study on March 3rd, 2020. Patients were ask about the current treatments, disease status, and concerns about disease management during the epidemic. Psychologic stress (scored from 0 to 10 points) and psychological problems were reported by the patients. Results A total of 157 patients (mean age 38.4 {+/-} 12.3 years, 66.9% females) were included in the study. None of the patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. Sixty-five (41.4%) patients worried about their disease conditions during the epidemic with concerns including medication shortage (73.8%), delay of consultation (46.2%), and disease aggravation (61.5%). Sixty-seven (42.7%) patients had medication withdrawal or dose reduction due to lack of drugs, irregular daily schedule or subjective reasons. The most common psychological problems reported was little interest or pleasure in doing things (66.2%). Patients with progressive disease condition were more distressed and disturbed by the epidemic. Patients with nail involvement felt more worried about their disease conditions than patients without (59.6% vs 31.0%, p =0. 001). Conclusions The COVID-19 epidemic imposes a negative impact on the disease management and psychological stress in SAPHO patients.

Substantial changes in the management of metastatic breast cancer patients have been required worldwide in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is focused to evaluate the adoption of the new guidelines for MBC patients who had been treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors. Methods: We had 2 groups of Metastatic BC ER+ HER2- patients who started the CDK4/6 inhibitors during 2 periods, from 1st June 2019 to 30th June 2020 and from 30th June 2020 to 31th October 2020, this includes 45 and 42 patients respectively. The international ESMO COVID-19 & national (NICE) guidelines were implemented. All changes to treatment were conducted in view of delay, omission or reduction of the dose to assess what were the most frequent implications of these changes. Toxicities assessed based on CTCAE 4.0. Data was compared between first and second wave of the pandemic in the UK. The evidence reported reflects the experience matured at our Trust. Results: Two groups of total of 87 patients were enrolled in the study who started treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors during both waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Comparison of the 2 groups revealed that 95.3% of patients were females. 45 and 42 patients had Palbociclib and abemaciclib. 13 of them aged > 75 years old. In the first wave: 33.3% had dose reduction. 8 Patients had progression. 15.6% had toxicity required admission. 57.8% continued the treatment without significant toxicities. In the second wave: 52.4% had dose reduction, of those 38.1% due to toxicities. DP in 4 patients. 23.8% had toxicity admission. 88.1% continued the treatment with non significant toxicities. The mortality was 4% in second group in comparison to 11.9% in the first one. No Covid-19 related death reported. Conclusions: The data comparing the oncological outcomes in patients who had their treatment during both waves of the pandemic confirmed the safety of the delivery of the CDK4/6 inhibitors during COVID-19. The Dose reduction has led to more tolerability and does not affect the efficacy. The neutropenia associated with CDK4/6 inhibitors is unlikely to increase the risk of Covid-19 infection.

639082,Systematic and Comprehensive Automated Ventricle Segmentation on Ventricle Images of the Elderly Patients: A Retrospective Study,2020-12-16,"BACKGROUND The impact of remdesivir (RDV) on COVID-19 mortality is controversial, and the mortality effect in sub-groups of baseline disease severity has been incompletely explored. The purpose of this study was to assess the association of RDV with mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS In this retrospective cohort study we compared persons receiving RDV to persons receiving best supportive care (BSC). Patients hospitalized between 2/28/20 - 5/28/20 with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included when they developed COVID-19 pneumonia on chest radiography, and hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen or SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air. The primary outcome was overall survival assessed with time-dependent Cox proportional-hazards regression and multivariable adjustment, including calendar time, baseline patient characteristics, corticosteroid use and effects for hospital. RESULTS 1,138 patients were enrolled including 286 who received RDV, and 852 treated with BSC, 400 of whom received hydroxychloroquine. Corticosteroids were used in 20.4% of the cohort (12.6% in RDV and 23% in BSC). In persons receiving RDV compared to those receiving BSC the HR (95%CI) for death was 0.46 (0.31 - 0.69) in the univariate model, p<0.001 and 0.60 (0.40 - 0.90) in the risk-adjusted model, p=0.014. In the sub-group of persons with baseline use of low-flow oxygen, the HR (95%CI) for death in RDV compared to BSC was 0.63 (0.39 - 1.00), p=0.049. CONCLUSION Treatment with RDV was associated with lower mortality compared to BSC. These findings remain the same in the subgroup with baseline use of low-flow oxygen.","Diaz, George A; Christensen, Alyssa B; Pusch, Tobias; Goulet, Delaney; Chang, Shu-Ching; Grunkemeier, Gary L; McKelvey, Paul A; Robicsek, Ari; French, Tom; Parsons, Guilford T; Doherty, Glenn; Laurenson, Charles; Roper, Ryan; Hadlock, Jennifer; Cover, Cameron J; Footer, Brent; Robinson, Philip; Micikas, Mary; Marfori, Jennifer E; Cronenweth, Charlotte; Mukkamala, Yogavedya; Mackiewicz, Jamie; Rai, Ekra; Matson, Martha Dickinson; Davila, Jodie; Rueda, Justin; Tipton, Reda; Algren, Heather; Ward, Brittney C; Malkoski, Stephen; Gluckman, Tyler; Tallman, Gregory B; Arguinchona, Henry; Hammond, Terese C; Standaert, Steven; Christensen, Joshua; Echaiz, Jose F; Choi, Robert; McClung, Daniel; Pacifico, Albert; Fee, Martin; Sarafian, Farjad; Berrington, William R; Goldman, Jason D",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34409431/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab698,311

COVID-19 has highlighted the need for clear and accurate guidance on the use of aerosol-generating procedures, such as nebulization, for the treatment of patients with respiratory diseases with or without COVID-19. Despite the lack of evidence, there is heightened concern about the potential risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the form of aerosolized respiratory droplets during the nebulized treatment of patients with COVID-19. Consequently, the use of metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) has risen considerably as an alternative to nebulized therapy, which has led to inadequate supplies of MDIs in some parts of the United States. In this article, we review and discuss the role of nebulization in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and the treatment of noninfected patients with chronic respiratory diseases. The following two important questions are addressed: (1) should nebulized therapy be used in hospital or home settings by patients infected with SARS-CoV-2; and (2) should nebulized therapy be continued in patients already using it for chronic respiratory disease management in hospital or home settings?

Investigations demonstrated a combination of severe hypokalemia, hyperchloremia, hypobicarbonatemia (non-gap metabolic acidosis), and relatively raised urinary potassium and urinary pH in the presence of severe hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. Results suggested a diagnosis of distal renal tubular acidosis. The patient responded rapidly to a short course of electrolyte replacement therapy and the condition resolved spontaneously thereafter.

641974,Outcomes of COVID-19 among Patients with End Stage Renal Disease on Remdesivir,2021-02-15,"Monitoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reconstructing transmission chains has become a major public health focus for many governments around the world. The modest mutation rate and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 prevents the reconstruction of transmission chains from consensus genome sequences, but within-host genetic diversity could theoretically help identify close contacts. Here we describe the patterns of within-host diversity in 1181 SARS-CoV-2 samples sequenced to high depth in duplicate. 95.1% of samples show within-host mutations at detectable allele frequencies. Analyses of the mutational spectra revealed strong strand asymmetries suggestive of damage or RNA editing of the plus strand, rather than replication errors, dominating the accumulation of mutations during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Within- and between-host diversity show strong purifying selection, particularly against nonsense mutations. Recurrent within-host mutations, many of which coincide with known phylogenetic homoplasies, display a spectrum and patterns of purifying selection more suggestive of mutational hotspots than recombination or convergent evolution. While allele frequencies suggest that most samples result from infection by a single lineage, we identify multiple putative examples of co-infection. Integrating these results into an epidemiological inference framework, we find that while sharing of within-host variants between samples could help the reconstruction of transmission chains, mutational hotspots and rare cases of superinfection can confound these analyses.","Tonkin-Hill, Gerry; Martincorena, Inigo; Amato, Roberto; Lawson, Andrew RJ; Gerstrung, Moritz; Johnston, Ian; Jackson, David K; Park, Naomi; Lensing, Stefanie V; Quail, Michael A; Gonçalves, Sonia; Ariani, Cristina; Spencer Chapman, Michael; Hamilton, William L; Meredith, Luke W; Hall, Grant; Jahun, Aminu S; Chaudhry, Yasmin; Hosmillo, Myra; Pinckert, Malte L; Georgana, Iliana; Yakovleva, Anna; Caller, Laura G; Caddy, Sarah L; Feltwell, Theresa; Khokhar, Fahad A; Houldcroft, Charlotte J; Curran, Martin D; Parmar, Surendra; Alderton, Alex; Nelson, Rachel; Harrison, Ewan M; Sillitoe, John; Bentley, Stephen D; Barrett, Jeffrey C; Torok, M Estee; Goodfellow, Ian G; Langford, Cordelia; Kwiatowski, Dominic P",eLife (Cambridge),https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.66857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34387545/,311

There is growing evidence that L-type lectins are also involved in viral replication. In this study, a novel L-type lectin (named as PcL-lectin) was identified from red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clakii). Gene sequencing and phylogenetic tree analysis results showed that the PcL-lectin was a kind of endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment-53 (ERGIC-53). The expression level of PcL-lectin was significantly down regulated in crayfish after challenged with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Recombinant PcL-lectin protein facilitated the replication of WSSV in crayfish. In addition, WSSV replication was decreased when endogenous PcL-lectin was knocked down by RNA interference in crayfish. Furthermore, PcL-lectin may interact with VP24, an envelope protein of WSSV. Our results suggest that PcL-lectin may be required for the multiplication of WSSV, and will pave a new way for the developing of strategies against WSSV infection.","Dai, Yunjia; Wang, Yuqing; Zhao, Lingling; Qin, Zhendong; Yuan, Junfa; Qin, Qiwei; Lin, Li; Lan, Jiangfeng",Fish Shellfish Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2016.05.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050464816303254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27208793/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1050464816303254,311

Prior research suggests that this decreases the psychological sense of loss or ‘pain’ that consumers feel when making a purchase with more direct payment types (such as cash) and leads them to spend more money. To help address this issue, the present research explores, designs, and tests haptic vibration feedback configurations aimed at restoring the ‘pain’ of paying with cashless payment options (i.e., online and mobile payment). Counter-intuitively, the present research finds that lower- (vs. higher-) intensity vibration feedback reduces participants’ reported willingness-to-spend when compared to a control group that does not receive any vibration feedback. This work is one of the first to explore the role of haptic vibration feedback in nudging consumers to reduce their spending when using cashless payment methods.","Manshad, Muhanad Shakir; Brannon, Daniel",J Bus Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296320305609; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.08.049; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0148296320305609; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32934427/,311
643851,Combination therapy with tocilizumab and corticosteroids for aged patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia: a single-center retrospective study.,2020-09-30,"Background Kidney disease accompanying coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not well understood, and information about the presentation of acute kidney injury (AKI), its risk factors, and outcomes is scarce, particularly in Bahrain and the Gulf region. In this study, we aimed to determine the rate of AKI among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia at a tertiary hospital in Bahrain and to describe the various aspects of AKI in these patients, including its relationship with respiratory failure and in-hospital mortality. Methods This retrospective observational cohort study of patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia from April 1 to May 31, 2020, excluded those aged less than 18 years, those with end-stage renal disease, and those with renal transplants. Clinical and laboratory patient data were collected. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria were used to define AKI. Results The mean age across the 73 included patients was approximately 54 years; about 60% were men, and nearly 58% were Bahraini nationals. Of the patients, 39.7% (29) developed AKI during hospitalization, out of which 11.0% reached stage 1, 15.1% reached stage 2, and 13.7% reached stage 3. Of all patients, seven (9.6%) required hemodialysis. Chronic kidney disease conferred an increased risk for AKI (P = 0.003) as did critical COVID-19 status (P < 0.001) and the necessity for mechanical ventilation or intensive care admission (P < 0.001 for both). Additionally, AKI was significantly associated with a lower PaO2/FiO2 (partial pressure of arterial oxygen/percentage of inspired oxygen) ratio (P < 0.001) and a greater number of medications for COVID-19 pneumonia (P = 0.003). Finally, in-hospital death tolls were remarkably higher in patients with AKI (P < 0.001). No association was found between AKI and each of the following therapies: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, tocilizumab, and convalescent plasma. Conclusions The rate of AKI in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia at our institution is relatively high and is strongly associated with disease severity, respiratory failure, and in-hospital mortality. Awareness of kidney disease in COVID-19 patients is crucial and of vital importance.","Taher, Abdulraqeeb; Alalwan, Adel A; Naser, Naser; Alsegai, Ola; Alaradi, Ali",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.9693; https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/original_article/pdf/37442/1597260049-20200812-8343-5phn4d.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32802627/,311

Infectious diseases, whether they be natural (e.g. SARS [severe acute respiratory syndrome] and influenza) or the result of bioterrorism, have the potential to create a large influx of critically ill into our already strained hospital systems. With proper planning, hospitals, health care workers and our health care systems can be better prepared to deal with such an eventuality. This review explores the Toronto critical care experience of coping in the SARS outbreak disaster. Our health care system and, in particular, our critical care system were unprepared for this event, and as a result the impact that SARS had was worse than it could have been. Nonetheless, we were able to organize a response rapidly during the outbreak. By describing our successes and failures, we hope to help others to learn and avoid the problems we encountered as they develop their own disaster management plans in anticipation of similar future situations.","Hawryluck, Laura; Lapinsky, Stephen E; Stewart, Thomas E",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16137388/,311

It is crucial to have a rapid and sensitive method to detect the bacterium Clostridium botulinum in food. In this study, a rapid detection assay of C. botulinum in food using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technology was developed. The optimal primers were identified among three sets of primers designed specifically based on the partial ntnh gene encoding nontoxic-nonhaemagglutinin (NTNH) for rapid detection of the target DNA in plasmids. The optimal temperature and reaction time of the LAMP assay were determined to be 64 °C and 60 min, respectively. The chemical kit could be assembled based on these optimized reaction conditions for quick, initial high-throughput screening of C. botulinum in food samples. The established LAMP assay showed high specificity and sensitivity in detecting the target DNA with a limit of 0.0001 pg/ul (i.e., ten times more sensitive than that of the PCR method) and an accuracy rate of 100%. This study demonstrated a potentially rapid, cost-effective, and easy-operating method to detect C. botulinum in food and clinical samples based on LAMP technology.","Chen, Yufei; Li, Hao; Yang, Liu; Wang, Lei; Sun, Ruyi; Shearer, Julia E.

645963,Differential Effect of Three Macrolide Antibiotics on Cardiac Pathology and Electrophysiology in a Myocardial Infarction Rat Model: Influence on Sodium Nav1.5 Channel Expression,2021-06-22,"The occurrence of the COVID-19-virus led to drastic short-term measures to reduce its spread and influence. Regulations such as “physical distancing,” mentioned as “social distancing,” and the closure of public facilities during the lockdown could be perceived as burdensome especially by individuals who feel a strong need for social exchange and belonging. These components such as need to belong and the fear of missing out also play a major role in the development and maintenance of a problematic use of social networks. Researchers have argued recently that an increase of addictive (online) behaviors may be a likely consequence of subjectively experienced restrictions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study investigates the interplay of perceived strain due to COVID-19-related restrictions and the fear of missing out (FoMO) as well as of symptoms of problematic social-networks use. We hypothesized that perceived strain due to COVID-19-related restrictions mediates the effect of specific predisposing variables related to social needs on the symptom severity of a problematic use. To assess the perceived strain due to COVID-19-related restrictions, we developed a specific questionnaire asking for perceived COVID-19-related strain in several domains of everyday-life. An exploratory factor analysis identified five factors: perceived strain related to restrictions of (1) social contacts, (2) travel, (3) childcare, (4) work, and (5) own health. In a sample of 719 German participants and data collection during the first COVID-19 lockdown (March 30th until April 3rd 2020), a structural equation model was calculated showing that higher levels of need to belong and FoMO increase perceived COVID-19-related strain, which is related to symptoms of a problematic social-networks use. The effect of need to belong on problematic social-networks use is mediated by experienced COVID-19-related strain and FoMO-online. Even if the use of social networks is not pathological per se, it may be associated with suffering for a vulnerable part of users. We conclude that specific needs and fear-associated predisposing variables contribute to experiencing physical distance and other pandemic-related restrictions as more stressful, which may increase problematic social-networks use and potentially other addictive behaviors as well in the context of the COVID-19-related lockdown.","Wegmann, Elisa; Brandtner, Annika; Brand, Matthias",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33967850/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.623099,311

This study aimed to determine the number of patients with COVID-19 who required intensive care and to compare the numbers with Japan’s intensive care capacity. Materials and Methods: Publicly available datasets were used to obtain the number of confirmed patients with COVID-19 undergoing mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) between 15 February and 19 July 2020 to determine and compare intensive care unit (ICU) and attending bed needs for patients with COVID-19, and to estimate peak ICU demands in Japan. Results: During the epidemic peak in late April, 11,443 patients (1.03/10,000 adults) had been infected, 373 patients (0.034/10,000 adults) were in ICU, 312 patients (0.028/10,000 adults) were receiving mechanical ventilation, and 62 patients (0.0056/10,000 adults) were under ECMO per day. At the peak of the epidemic, the number of infected patients was 651% of designated beds, and the number of patients requiring intensive care was 6.0% of ICU beds, 19.1% of board-certified intensivists, and 106% of designated medical institutions in Japan.

648139,Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) Plasma Concentration in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: A Prospective Observational Study,2021-02-17,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV‑2 outbreak, healthcare professionals reported that patients admitted with ST-segment myocardial infarction (STEMI) were in worse condition compared to STEMI patients admitted before the outbreak. However, data on their outcomes are sparse. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational, cohort study of STEMI patients admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 21, 2020 to July 31, 2020 (COVID-19 group). Clinical outcomes, 30-day mortality, and reasons potentially related to a delay in patient presentation were assessed and compared with STEMI patients admitted between November 1, 2019 and March 20, 2020 (pre-COVID-19 group). RESULTS: A total of 124 patients were enrolled, comprising 57 patients in the pre-COVID-19 group and 67 patients in the COVID-19 group. Significantly more patients in the COVID-19 group had a time to first medical contact of greater than 24 h. Additionally, those admitted during the pandemic had a significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), worse thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow, received circulatory support significantly more often, and had a significantly higher 30-day mortality. Furthermore, significantly more patients stated that “information by the media” made them hesitate to contact the emergency medical services as soon as possible. CONCLUSION: Here, we show that STEMI patients admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic had significantly prolonged times to first medical contact, were in worse condition at admission, and had an increased 30-day mortality. Additionally, we found that “information by the media” made patients during COVID-19 hesitate to contact the emergency medical services. Consequently, public health strategies have to be developed to avoid potential excess mortality of STEMI patients during the pandemic.

A research gap was identified in the literature concerning the study of the amount of energy that these systems need for their operation, and the energy efficiency that may be attained depending on their design. After the selection of five representative PHRs, a total of 20 tasks commonly done, and based on previous work, were performed with regard to two proposed scenarios, namely patient use and health personnel usage. The power consumption of the main components of a host machine was measured during the performance of the proposed duties. To that end, a hardware tool called the Energy Efficiency Tester was employed. The data collected were analyzed statistically, and significant differences were found in the respective consumption of the display (χ(2) (4)=23.782, p=0.000), the processor (χ(2) (4)=29.018, p=0.000) and the whole PC (χ(2) (4)=28.582, p=0.000). For all of these components, NoMoreClipBoard was the personal health record that required the least energy (57.699 W for the display, 3.162 W for the processor and 181.113 W for the whole PC). A total of two strong correlations were found in the energy consumption between the hard disk and the graphics card (r=0.791, p<0.001), and the processor and the PC (r=0.950, p<0.001). Some features generated special amounts of power consumption, such as the news wall found on PatientsLikeMe, or the use of load icons that had an impact on most PC components. In addition, an in-depth analysis of the user interfaces was performed. A discussion was carried out on the design of the user interfaces, also taking into account recommendations drawn from the literature, checking for their implementation in the personal health records selected.

Outside of China, Italy is one of the countries suffering the most with the COVID-19 epidemic. It is important to predict the epidemic trend of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy to help develop public health strategies. Methods: We used time-series data of COVID-19 from Jan 22 2020 to Apr 02 2020. An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible-infected-removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI). Hunan, with a similar total population number to Italy, was used as a comparative item. Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the mean of basic reproductive number for COVID-19 was 4.34 (95% CI, 3.04–6.00) in Italy and 3.16 (95% CI, 1.73–5.25) in Hunan. There would be a total of 182 051 infected cases (95%CI:116 114–274 378) under the current country blockade and the endpoint would be Aug 05 in Italy. Conclusion: Italy's current strict measures can efficaciously prevent the further spread of COVID-19 and should be maintained. Necessary strict public health measures should be implemented as soon as possible in other European countries with a high number of COVID-19 cases. The most effective strategy needs to be confirmed in further studies.","Wangping, Jia; Ke, Han; Yang, Song; Wenzhe, Cao; Shengshu, Wang; Shanshan, Yang; Jianwei, Wang; Fuyin, Kou; Penggang, Tai; Jing, Li; Miao, Liu; Yao, He",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32435645/,311

Face-to-face interviewing was conducted with 49 rice producers engaged in chemical, organic, and good agricultural practices in farming activities. The results show that most of the emissions were caused during the post-harvest management stage. Following eco-efficiency, organic jasmine rice production offers a reduction in the consumption of resources, reduced impact on the environment, and increased product value. Furthermore, our study shows that crop residue is a key to increase rice yields and decrease GHGs emissions.

651496,Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency severity and the risk of COVID-19: A Portuguese cohort,2021-04-02,"Previous literature suggests a relationship between individual characteristics of motion perception and the peak frequency of motion sickness sensitivity. Here, we used well-established paradigms to relate motion perception and motion sickness on an individual level. We recruited 23 participants to complete a two-part experiment. In the first part, we determined individual velocity storage time constants from perceived rotation in response to Earth Vertical Axis Rotation (EVAR) and subjective vertical time constants from perceived tilt in response to centrifugation. The cross-over frequency for resolution of the gravito-inertial ambiguity was derived from our data using the Multi Sensory Observer Model (MSOM). In the second part of the experiment, we determined individual motion sickness frequency responses. Participants were exposed to 30-minute sinusoidal fore-aft motions at frequencies of 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 Hz, with a peak amplitude of 2 m/s(2) in five separate sessions, approximately 1 week apart. Sickness responses were recorded using both the MIsery SCale (MISC) with 30 s intervals, and the Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire (MSAQ) at the end of the motion exposure. The average velocity storage and subjective vertical time constants were 17.2 s (STD = 6.8 s) and 9.2 s (STD = 7.17 s). The average cross-over frequency was 0.21 Hz (STD = 0.10 Hz). At the group level, there was no significant effect of frequency on motion sickness. However, considerable individual variability was observed in frequency sensitivities, with some participants being particularly sensitive to the lowest frequencies, whereas others were most sensitive to intermediate or higher frequencies. The frequency of peak sensitivity did not correlate with the velocity storage time constant (r = 0.32, p = 0.26) or the subjective vertical time constant (r = − 0.37, p = 0.29). Our prediction of a significant correlation between cross-over frequency and frequency sensitivity was not confirmed (r = 0.26, p = 0.44). However, we did observe a strong positive correlation between the subjective vertical time constant and general motion sickness sensitivity (r = 0.74, p = 0.0006). We conclude that frequency sensitivity is best considered a property unique to the individual. This has important consequences for existing models of motion sickness, which were fitted to group averaged sensitivities. The correlation between the subjective vertical time constant and motion sickness sensitivity supports the importance of verticality perception during exposure to translational sickness stimuli.

Being generally-unwell was common amongst symptomatic residents and may indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection in older people in the absence of more typical symptoms. Where a resident appears generally unwell SARS-CoV-2-infection should be suspected. Protocols for testing involved integrated health and social care teams.","Smith, E.; Aldus, C.

First, primary cell cultures were used to determine the susceptibility of each type of neural cells to virus infection. Neurons were the target cells, undergoing degeneration during infection, in part due to apoptosis. Second, neuropathogenicity was investigated in susceptible mice. Intracerebral inoculation of HCoV-OC43 into BALB/c mice led to an acute encephalitis with neuronal cell death by necrosis and apoptosis. Infectious virus was apparently cleared from surviving animals, whereas viral RNA persisted for several months. Some of the animals surviving to acute encephalitis presented an abnormal limb clasping reflex and a decrease in motor activity starting several months post-infection. These results suggest that viral persistence could be associated with an increased neuronal degeneration leading to neuropathology and motor deficits in susceptible individuals.","Jacomy, Hélène; Fragoso, Gabriela; Almazan, Guillermina; Mushynski, Walter E.; Talbot, Pierre J.",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682206000389; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16527322/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682206000389,311

Accumulation of mutations in the S gene and the accessory gene 5a were observed, suggesting a potential role in the loss of viral pathogenicity. Two recombinant IBVs (rIBVs) with replacement of the S gene or 5a with corresponding regions from aYN were rescued to verify this speculation. Embryo mortality time/rate showed that rYN-S-aYN and rYN-5a-aYN had an attenuated phenotype in ovo. Replication assay in ovo and in vitro demonstrated the rIBVs had similar replication patterns with wild-type rIBV. Both rIBVs showed reduced mortality, tissue lesions and tissue virus titers in chicken. In conclusion, S gene and 5a accessory gene are responsible for the attenuation of virulent IBV. Insight into the genes responsible for virus attenuation will facilitate the development of future vaccines against IBV.","Zhao, Ye; Cheng, Jinlong; Yan, Shihong; Jia, Wenfeng; Zhang, Keran; Zhang, Guozhong",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2019.04.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268221930114X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268221930114X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31078931/,311
653863,Chest CT in coronavirus pandemic. Are there really age based radiological and clinical differences?,2020-06-01,"Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV) has spread quickly worldwide, with more than 29 million cases and 920,000 deaths. Interestingly, coronaviruses were found to subvert and hijack the autophagic process to allow their viral replication. One of the spotlights had been focused on the autophagy inhibitors as a target mechanism effective in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Consequently, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a derivative of CQ, was suggested as the first potentially be therapeutic strategies as they are known to be autophagy inhibitors. Then, they were used as therapeutics in SARS-CoV-2 infection along with remdesivir, for which the FDA approved emergency use authorization. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity and associated mechanism of GNS561, a small basic lipophilic molecule inhibitor of late-stage autophagy, against SARS-CoV-2. Our data indicated that GNS561 showed the highest antiviral effect for two SARS-CoV-2 strains compared to CQ and remdesivir. Focusing on the autophagy mechanism, we showed that GNS561, located in LAMP2-positive lysosomes, together with SARS-CoV-2, blocked autophagy by increasing the size of LC3-II spots and the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm with the presence of multilamellar bodies characteristic of a complexed autophagy. Finally, our study revealed that the combination of GNS561 and remdesivir was associated with a strong synergistic antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our study highlights GNS561 as a powerful drug in SARS-CoV-2 infection and supports that the hypothesis that autophagy inhibitors could be an alternative strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Halfon, Philippe; Bestion, Eloïne; Zandi, Keivan; Andreani, Julien; Baudoin, Jean-Pierre; La Scola, Bernard; Mege, Jean-Louis; Mezouar, Soraya; Schinazi, Raymond F.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.06.327635; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052342/,311

Cleaning and disinfection regimens are essential components in its prevention but need to be validated, monitored, and verified. This in turn requires the implementation of protocols for surface sampling and the assessment of residual contamination. Visual assessment although widely used, in isolation, is ineffective but can be useful as part of an integrated approach. Microbial and nonmicrobial methods of sampling and testing are compared. Nonmicrobial assessment methods, especially ATP, are effective at monitoring residual surface soil. Traditional specific, and nonspecific, microbial methods indicate residual microbial contamination but not surface soil. Recent advances in molecular microbial methods and bioluminogenic tests are discussed. There is no single ideal surface test method and how, when, and where to sample are discussed within the framework of suggested guidelines, an integrated approach, and the use of trend analysis.","Griffith, C.",Handbook of Hygiene Control in the Food Industry,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780081001554000443; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780081001554000443,311

The goal of our study was to test a new 10-plex electro-chemiluminescence-based assay to measure IgM and IgG responses to the spike proteins from multiple human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, assess the epitope specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response against full-length spike protein, receptor-binding domain and N-terminal domain of the spike protein, and the nucleocapsid protein. We carried out the assay on samples collected from three sample groups: subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 from the U.S. Army hospital at Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, South Korea; healthcare administrators from the same hospital but with no reported diagnosis of COVID-19; and pre-pandemic samples. We found that the new CoV-specific multiplex assay was highly sensitive allowing plasma samples to be diluted 1:30,000 with a robust signal. The reactivity of IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could distinguish COVID-19 samples from non-COVID-19 and pre-pandemic samples. The data from the three sample groups also revealed a unique pattern of cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and seasonal coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43. Our findings show that the CoV-2 IgM response is highly specific while the CoV-2 IgG response is more cross-reactive across a range of human CoVs and also showed that IgM and IgG responses show distinct patterns of epitope specificity. In summary, this multiplex assay was able to distinguish samples by COVID-19 status and characterize distinct trends in terms of cross-reactivity and fine-specificity in antibody responses, underscoring its potential value in diagnostic or serosurveillance efforts.","Chaudhury, S.; Hutter, J.

METHODS: PubMed was searched for all of the studies published over the last 15 years using the key words “Kawasaki syndrome” or “mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome” and “infectious disease” or “genetics” or “vasculitis” or “pathogenesis”. RESULTS: Various levels of evidence support the hypothesis that KS is a complex disease triggered by an infection due to one or more pathogens. Viruses or bacteria may be the primum movens, although no specific infectious agent can be considered definitely etiological. A number of genetic polymorphisms have been identified in subjects with KS, but none of them can currently be considered a real marker of susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: Various data suggest that KS is intimately related to infectious diseases and that its clinical expression is influenced by predisposing genetic backgrounds, but our knowledge of the infectious agent(s) involved and the genetic characteristics of susceptible children remains only partial. Further studies are needed to address the many still open questions concerning the disease.","Principi, Nicola; Rigante, Donato; Esposito, Susanna",J Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445313000777; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445313000777; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2013.04.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23603251/,311

We evaluated whether the pandemic has impacted the appropriateness and diagnostic yield of fast-track endoscopic procedures compared with those performed in 2019. Methods This retrospective study involved endoscopy services in Northern Italy. We compared data regarding endoscopic procedures performed in March and April 2020 with those performed during the same period in 2019. Results In 2020, there was a 53.6 % reduction in the number of fast-track endoscopic procedures compared with 2019. Patients undergoing endoscopy in 2020 were younger than in 2019. Both appropriate referral and diagnostic yield increased in 2020 for both upper and lower endoscopy. A higher rate of cancer was diagnosed in 2020 by upper endoscopy (3.6 % vs. 6.6 %; P = 0.04).

To investigate the potential modes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, 21 COVID-19 patients from 12–47 days after symptom onset were recruited. We monitored the release of SARS-CoV-2 from the patients’ exhaled breath and systematically investigated environmental contamination of air, public surfaces, personal necessities, and the drainage system. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 0 of 9 exhaled breath samples, 2 of 8 exhaled breath condensate samples, 1 of 12 bedside air samples, 4 of 132 samples from private surfaces, 0 of 70 samples from frequently touched public surfaces in isolation rooms, and 7 of 23 feces-related air/surface/water samples. The maximum viral RNA concentrations were 1857 copies/m(3) in the air, 38 copies/cm(2) in sampled surfaces and 3092 copies/mL in sewage/wastewater samples. Our results suggest that nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur via multiple routes. However, the low detection frequency and limited quantity of viral RNA from the breath and environmental specimens may be related to the reduced viral load of the COVID-19 patients on later days after symptom onset.

However, the parent experience of communication in the pediatric surgical setting remains unexplored. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 parents of children undergoing surgery. Interviews were analyzed using directed qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Content analysis revealed 3 overarching themes. The theme of “provider–parent communication” included interpersonal behaviors and communication-originating skills of the surgeon. Parents valued surgeons incorporating multimodal information-sharing techniques, recognizing children’s psychological needs, providing reassurance, engaging in teamwork, and including parents. The theme of “parental emotional experiences” included domains of parent worry, intimidation, offense, self-doubt, mistrust, and strength surrounding their child’s surgery. Parents felt simultaneously responsible for their child’s welfare and for understanding medical information. The theme of “process improvement” included preparation for surgery, efficiency, managing delays, anesthesia induction, emergence from anesthesia, privacy, and preparation for recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Themes identified through these parental narratives and proposed solutions inform quality improvement efforts related to surgeon communication strategies and facilitate family-centered surgical care for children. Parents often provided solutions after they described concerns, which attests to the utility of parent perspectives.","Claus, Lauren E; Links, Anne R; Amos, Janine; DiCarlo, Heather; Jelin, Eric; Koka, Rahul; Beach, Mary Catherine; Boss, Emily F.",Pediatr Qual Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046536/; https://doi.org/10.1097/pq9.0000000000000403,311

Incorporating video-conferencing applications in the patient handover process between healthcare workers can enhance social distancing while maintaining handover elements. This study describes pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) physicians’ experience using an online video-conferencing application for handover during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Qualitative content analysis. SETTING: PICU at a university hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. SUBJECTS: PICU Physicians. INTERVENTIONS: Due to the pandemic, the hospital’s PICU used Zoom(®) as a remote conferencing application instead of a face-to-face handover. Following institutional review board approval, data were collected over two weeks (1 Jul 2020 to 14 Jul 2020). MEASUREMENTS: An online survey was conducted using open-ended questions to capture demographic data and the perceived efficacy of remote handovers. Thematic framework analysis process included open coding, creating categories, and abstraction. MAIN RESULTS: All 37 PICU physicians who participated in the handover completed the survey. The participants comprised six attendings, nine specialists, and 22 residents. While 20 (54.1%) physicians reported attending 1–5 Zoom handovers by the time of the study, some (n. 6, 16.2%) had more than ten virtual handovers. They had variable previous teleconferencing experiences. Most physicians (78.4%) were comfortable conducting a remote handover. Most found that Situation–Background–Assessment–Recommendation handover elements were properly achieved through this remote handover process. The perceived advantages of online handover included fewer interruptions, time efficiency, and facilitation of social distancing. The perceived disadvantages were the paucity of nonverbal communication and teaching during virtual meetings. CONCLUSION: Video-conferencing applications for online handovers could supplement traditional face-to-face intensive care unit patient handover during outbreaks of infectious diseases. The use of video streaming and more emphasis on teaching should be encouraged to optimize the users’ experience.","Temsah, Mohamad-Hani; Abouammoh, Noura; Ashry, Ahmed; Al-Eyadhy, Ayman; Alhaboob, Ali; Alsohime, Fahad; Almazyad, Mohammed; Alabdulhafid, Majed; Temsah, Reem; Aljamaan, Fadi; Jamal, Amr; Halwani, Rabih; Alhasan, Khalid; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A; Barry, Mazin",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34211276/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s310028,311

Our study investigates coagulation markers and the incidence of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients receiving recommended anticoagulation strategies. METHODS: In a retrospective single-center analysis at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland, we investigated 31 adult COVID-19 patients between April 6(th) and May 13(th), 2020 and with at least one laboratory assessment of the coagulation markers prothrombin time/Quick, thrombin time, fibrinogen and D-dimers. For antithrombotic prophylaxis low-molecular-weight-heparin or unfractionated heparin was administered and two patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia received argatroban. RESULTS: We analyzed 31 patients (68% male, mean age 60± SD 15 years). 22 (71%) of these required intensive care unit treatment, 5 (16%) were hospitalized in a ward, and 4 (13%) were outpatients. Mean fibrinogen levels were markedly elevated to 6.4± SD 1.8g/l, with a peak in the third week of the disease and no significant decrease over time. D-dimers were elevated to a mean value of 5.1±4.4mg/l with peak levels of 6.8±5.3mg/l in the fourth week of disease, and a subsequent decrease. Platelet count (308±136G/l) and PT/Quick (85±22%) showed no significant changes over time. Sensitivity analyses for patients treated in the ICU showed that D-dimer levels were higher in this group. The results of other sensitivity analyses were comparable. Thromboembolic events were diagnosed in 4 (13%) patients and 5 (16%) patients died during the observation period.

660766,Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of COVID-19 Among Patients with Pre-Existing Liver Disease in United States: A Multi-Center Research Network Study,2020-05-04,"Abstract The myxozoan parasite Ceratomyxa shasta has been identified as the main contributor of mortality in salmon in the Klamath River, California. The life cycle of the parasite is complex, involving a polychaete and a salmonid host. Infection dynamics are greatly influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature and water velocity. If we are to control the disease it is important to predict the impact of environmental scenarios on spore concentration and infection prevalence. Here, we introduce a model based on partial differential equations to study the spore concentration in the river and the infection prevalence of returning salmon. The analysis of the model shows that for current climate conditions, additional dam release can reduce the actinospore concentration up to 48% and the prevalence up to 40% thus providing a potential disease management option. However, the infection risk is likely to increase for future climate conditions by 10–54% and this will lead to an infection level comparable to that of a recent high-disease year. Our simulations show that dam removal cannot be assumed to mitigate the effect of climate change or to have influence on infection prevalence. We show that our detailed model system can be reduced to a simpler exponential dose-response function, which predicts infection levels based on transmission rates, travel time and mean spore concentration, quantities that can be measured in-situ or given empirically.

In this work, we analyzed a corpus of 66,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. We developed a novel semi-supervised pipeline for automated gene, protein, and functional domain annotation of SARS-CoV-2 genomes that differentiates itself by not relying on use of a single reference genome and by overcoming atypical genome traits. Using this method, we identified the comprehensive set of known proteins with 98.5% set membership accuracy and 99.1% accuracy in length prediction compared to proteome references including Replicase polyprotein 1ab (with its transcriptional slippage site). Compared to other published tools such as Prokka (base) and VAPiD, we yielded an 6.4- and 1.8-fold increase in protein annotations. Our method generated 13,000,000 molecular target sequences— some conserved across time and geography while others represent emerging variants. We observed 3,362 non-redundant sequences per protein on average within this corpus and describe key D614G and N501Y variants spatiotemporally. For spike glycoprotein domains, we achieved greater than 97.9% sequence identity to references and characterized Receptor Binding Domain variants. Here, we comprehensively present the molecular targets to refine biomedical interventions for SARS-CoV-2 with a scalable high-accuracy method to analyze newly sequenced infections.","Beck, Kristen L.; Seabolt, Ed; Agarwal, Akshay; Nayar, Gowri; Bianco, Simone; Krishnareddy, Harsha; Mukherjee, Vandana; Kaufman, James H.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.03.440524,311
662503,Tocilizumab: A retrospective multi-center cohort study of critically ill patients with COVID-19.,2021-08-27,"BACKGROUND: The intention of the following study was to describe the interrelationship between villagers, domestic animals and wildlife at the Community Forestry Concession of Uaxactún, Guatemala by means of participatory epidemiological methods. The main focus was generating information regarding different livestock diseases considered important by villagers and their relevance, as well as obtaining knowledge concerning hunting activities and cooking methods to gain a better understanding of the interrelationship of people and animals and the diseases of their animals. RESULTS: For poultry, an overall prevalence of 41 % of Newcastle disease was found by means of the ELISA test by antibody detection, chicken being the most affected species in the village. No samples were positive to avian influenza with the HI test. No virus was isolated by means of the tracheal or cloaca swabbing of ducks. FOR HUNTING: All species could be hunted by chance at any time of the year. There was a difference in species hunted between seasons, peccaries being more frequently hunted during the dry season and in contrast, deer and wild avian during the rainy season. FOR COOKING: Villagers did not consume any raw meat. The cooking methods depended on the species. Stewing was the most favoured method for peccaries, wild birds, tepezcuintle and domestic poultry, whereas grilling was preferable for deer, roasting for armadillos and marinating for pork. CONCLUSION: According to the generated information, the most important domestic livestock species in the village are chickens and pigs, chickens being the most affected by diseases. No evident health problems on pigs were observed in this study. Hunting was shown as an activity enhanced by poverty and the lack of employment opportunities in the village and was mostly directed at larger species such as deer and peccaries. From the viewpoint of a transmission of zoonoses from animals to humans cooking methods mostly reflected a protective factor as no raw meat was eaten, stews and broths being the most common forms of cooking, involving an exposure of meat to high temperatures. Nonetheless, both agricultural and hunting activities represent a risk factor for the spread of diseases as hunters may act as mechanical vectors for different pathogens within domestic and wild animal populations.","Mérida Ruíz, Samuel Alberto; Guerra Centeno, Dennis Sigfried; Bailey Leonardo, Edgar Leonel; Rohn, Karl; Kösters, Sarah; Kreienbrock, Lothar",BMC Res Notes,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-016-2009-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27055652/,311
663981,Ascertainment rate of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Japan,2020-03-10,"Protein ubiquitination is a highly conserved post-translational modification affecting various biological processes including viral propagation. Ubiquitination has multiple effects on viral propagation, including viral genome uncoating, viral replication, and immune evasion. Ubiquitination of viral proteins is triggered by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). This involves the covalent attachment of the highly conserved 76 amino acid residue ubiquitin protein to target proteins by the consecutive actions of E1, E2 and E3 enzymes, and the 26S proteasome that together form a multiprotein complex that degrades target proteins. The UPS is the primary cytosolic proteolytic machinery for the selective degradation of various forms of proteins including viral proteins, thereby limiting viral growth in host cells. To combat this host anti-viral machinery, viruses have evolved the ability to employ or subvert the UPS to inactivate or degrade cellular proteins to favour viral propagation. This review highlights our current knowledge on the different roles of the UPS during viral propagation.","Tang, Qi; Wu, Peng; Chen, Huiqing; Li, Guohui",Life Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320518303552; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2018.06.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320518303552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29913185/,311

Although it is well established that some fraction of the expiratory airflow leaks around the edges of the mask, it is unclear how these leakage airflows affect the overall efficiency with which masks block emission of expiratory aerosol particles. Here, we show experimentally that the aerosol particle concentrations in the leakage airflows around a surgical mask are reduced compared to no mask wearing, with the magnitude of reduction dependent on the direction of escape (out the top, the sides, or the bottom). Because the actual leakage flowrate in each direction is difficult to measure, we use a Monte Carlo approach to estimate flow-corrected particle emission rates for particles having diameters in the range 0.5–20 μm. in all orientations. From these, we derive a flow-weighted overall number-based particle removal efficiency for the mask. The overall mask efficiency, accounting both for air that passes through the mask and for leakage flows, is reduced compared to the through-mask filtration efficiency, from 93 to 70% for talking, but from only 94–90% for coughing. These results demonstrate that leakage flows due to imperfect sealing do decrease mask efficiencies for reducing emission of expiratory particles, but even with such leakage surgical masks provide substantial control.","Cappa, Christopher D.; Asadi, Sima; Barreda, Santiago; Wexler, Anthony S.; Bouvier, Nicole M.; Ristenpart, William D.",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91487-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34103573/,311
664710,Prior immunosuppressive therapy is associated with mortality in COVID‐19 patients: A retrospective study of 835 patients,2021-06-02,"Infectious disease surveillance systems provide vital data for guiding disease prevention and control policies, yet the formalization of methods to optimize surveillance networks has largely been overlooked. Decisions surrounding surveillance design parameters—such as the number and placement of surveillance sites, target populations, and case definitions—are often determined by expert opinion or deference to operational considerations, without formal analysis of the influence of design parameters on surveillance objectives. Here we propose a simulation framework to guide evidence-based surveillance network design to better achieve specific surveillance goals with limited resources. We define evidence-based surveillance design as an optimization problem, acknowledging the many operational constraints under which surveillance systems operate, the many dimensions of surveillance system design, the multiple and competing goals of surveillance, and the complex and dynamic nature of disease systems. We describe an analytical framework—the Disease Surveillance Informatics Optimization and Simulation (DIOS) framework—for the identification of optimal surveillance designs through mathematical representations of disease and surveillance processes, definition of objective functions, and numerical optimization. We then apply the framework to the problem of selecting candidate sites to expand an existing surveillance network under alternative objectives of: (1) improving spatial prediction of disease prevalence at unmonitored sites; or (2) estimating the observed effect of a risk factor on disease. Results of this demonstration illustrate how optimal designs are sensitive to both surveillance goals and the underlying spatial pattern of the target disease. The findings affirm the value of designing surveillance systems through quantitative and adaptive analysis of network characteristics and performance. The framework can be applied to the design of surveillance systems tailored to setting-specific disease transmission dynamics and surveillance needs, and can yield improved understanding of tradeoffs between network architectures.","Cheng, Qu; Collender, Philip A.; Heaney, Alexandra K.; Li, Xintong; Dasan, Rohini; Li, Charles; Lewnard, Joseph A.; Zelner, Jonathan L.; Liang, Song; Chang, Howard H.; Waller, Lance A.; Lopman, Benjamin A.; Yang, Changhong; Remais, Justin V.",PLoS Comput Biol,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008477; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33275606/,311

METHODS: A cross-sectional study involved 172 individuals who had headache due to COVID-19 infection. A detailed analysis of such headache was done through a face-to-face interview. Patients with any other form of secondary headache were excluded. Labs, including lymphocytic count, C-reactive protein, D-dimer and ferritin and chest imaging, were made available. RESULTS: THE: majority of our patients had a diffuse headache (52.9%). It was pressing in 40.7%, with median intensity of 7 (assessed by visual analogue scale) and median frequency of 7 days/week. Patients with preexisting primary headache (52.9%) had significantly more frequent COVID-19 related headache than those without (47.1%) (p = 0.001). Dehydrated patients (64.5%) had more frequent COVID-19 related headache than those who were not dehydrated (35.5%) (p = 0.029). Patients with fever (69.8%) had significantly higher frequency and intensity of COVID-19 related headache compared to those without fever (30.2%) (p = 0.003, 0.012). Patients with comorbidities (19.8%) had significantly higher frequency and intensity of headache than those without comorbidities (80.2%) (p = 0.006, 0.003). After multiple linear regression, primary headache disorders, dehydration and comorbidities were considered predictors of frequency of COVID-19 related headache. Meanwhile, fever and dehydration were predictors of pain intensity.

665374,Accumulated Clinical Experiences from Successful Treatment of 1377 Severe and Critically Ill COVID-19 Cases,2020-08-07,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increasing number of infections and deaths on a daily basis. There is no specific treatment or vaccine identified and the focus has been preventive measures based on statistical and mathematical models. These have relied on analyzing the behavior of populations and characteristics of the infection and applying modelling techniques. The analysis of epidemiological curve fitting on number of daily infections across affected countries could give useful insights on the characteristics of the epidemic. A variety of phenomenological models are available to capture dynamics of disease spread and growth. Data for this study used the number of daily new infections and cumulative number of infections in COVID-19 in three selected countries, Sri Lanka, Italy and Hebei province of China, from the first day of appearance of cases to 20th April 2020. In this study Gompertz, Logistic and Exponential growth curves were fitted on cumulative number of infections across countries. Akaikes information criteria (AIC) was used in determining the best fitting curve for each country. Results revealed that the most appropriate growth curves for Sri Lanka, Italy and China-Hebei are Exponential, Gompertz and Logistic curves respectively. The overall growth rate and final epidemic size evaluated from best models for the three countries and short-term forecasts were also generated. Log incidences over time in each country were regressed before and after the identified peak time of the respective outbreaks of countries. Hence, doubling time/halving time together with daily growth rates and predictions were estimated. Findings altogether demonstrate that outbreak seems extinct in Hebei-China whereas further transmissions are possible in Sri Lanka. In Italy, current outbreak transmits in a decreasing rate.

This compound efficiently protects cells against various toxins and pathogens including viruses, intracellular bacteria and parasite. ABMA provokes Rab7-positive late endosomal compartment accumulation in mammalian cells without affecting other organelles (early endosomes, lysosomes, the Golgi apparatus, the endoplasmic reticulum or the nucleus).

After validation by local epidemiological observations, the model was used to assess the probability of COVID-19 resurgence if sporadic cases occurred in a fully reopened city. Combined scenarios of three critical non-pharmaceutical interventions (contact tracing, mask wearing and prompt testing) were assessed at various levels of public compliance. Our results show a greater than 50% chance of disease resurgence if the city reopened without contact tracing. However, tracing household contacts, in combination with mandatory mask use and prompt testing, could suppress the probability of resurgence under 5% within four weeks. If household contact tracing could be expanded to work/class group members, the COVID resurgence could be avoided if 80% of the population wear facemasks and 40% comply with prompt testing.

The purposes of this systematic review were two-fold: (1) to describe the patterns of muscle strength loss with age in the general population, and (2) to quantify the loss of muscle strength in rheumatoid arthritis as representative for an underlying inflammatory state. Handgrip strength was used as a proxy for overall muscle strength. RESULTS: Results from 114 studies (involving 90,520 subjects) and 71 studies (involving 10,529 subjects) were combined in a meta-analysis for the general and rheumatoid arthritis population respectively and standardized at an equal sex distribution. For the general population we showed that between the ages of 25 years and 95 years mean handgrip strength declined from 45.5 kg to 23.2 kg for males and from 27.1 kg to 12.8 kg for females. We noted a steeper handgrip strength decline after 50 years of age (rate of 0.37 kg/year). In the rheumatoid arthritis population handgrip strength was not associated with chronological age between the ages of 35 years and 65 years and was as low as 20.2 kg in male and 15.1 in female. Rheumatoid arthritis disease duration was inversely associated with handgrip strength. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows distinct patterns of age-related decrease of handgrip strength in the general population. Handgrip strength is strongly associated with the presence and duration of an inflammatory state as rheumatoid arthritis. The putative link between age-related inflammation and sarcopenia mandates further study as it represents a potential target for intervention to maintain functional independence in old age.","Beenakker, Karel G.M.; Ling, Carolina H.; Meskers, Carel G.M.; de Craen, Anton J.M.; Stijnen, Theo; Westendorp, Rudi G.J.; Maier, Andrea B.",Ageing Res Rev,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2010.05.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568163710000486; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568163710000486; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20553969/,311

671517,CT imaging features of 4121 patients with COVID‐19: A meta‐analysis,2020-04-29,"Introduction The objectives were to characterise the particle size distribution of aerosols generated by standard dental aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) and to assess the impact of aerosol-management interventions on 'fallow time'. Interventions included combinations of high-volume intraoral suction (HVS[IO]), high-volume extraoral suction (HVS[EO]) and an air cleaning system (ACS). Method A sequence of six AGPs were performed on a phantom head. Real-time aerosol measurements (particle size range 0.0062-9.6 μm) were acquired from six locations within a typical dental treatment room (35 m(3)). Results The majority (>99%) of AGP particles were <0.3 μm diameter and remained at elevated levels around the dental team during the AGPs. With no active aerosol-management interventions, AGP particles were estimated to remain above the baseline range for up to 30 minutes from the end of the sequence of procedures. Conclusions The results emphasise the importance of personal protection equipment, particularly respiratory protection. Use of HVS(IO), either alone or in combination with the ACS, reduced particle concentrations to baseline levels on completion of AGPs. These data indicate potential to eliminate fallow time. The study was performed using a phantom head so confirmatory studies with patients are required.

Using an optimized process of DNA probe preparation to minimize the effect of contaminants in commercial thiolated DNA probe, the electrode surface was functionalized with the 24-nucleotide DNA probes based on the West Nile virus sequence (Kunjin strain). The biosensor has the ability to detect complementary DNA fragments with a detection limit down to 20 DNA target molecules (1.5 aM range), making it suitable for a practical point-of-care (POC) platform for low target count clinical applications without the need for amplification. The reproducibility of the biosensor detection was improved with efficient covalent immobilization of purified single-stranded DNA probe oligomers on cleaned gold microelectrodes. In addition to the low detection limit, the biosensor showed a dynamic range of detection from 1 μL(−1) to 10(5) μL(−1) target molecules (20 to 2 million targets), making it suitable for sample analysis in a typical clinical application environment. The binding results presented in this paper were validated using fluorescent oligomers.","Wang, Lei; Veselinovic, Milena; Yang, Lang; Geiss, Brian J.; Dandy, David S.; Chen, Tom",Biosensors and Bioelectronics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27619528/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S095656631630879X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095656631630879X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.09.006; https://manuscript.elsevier.com/S095656631630879X/pdf/S095656631630879X.pdf,311

This case highlights an unusual presentation and complex management of a patient who was incidentally found to have a left atrial tumour concerning for a myxoma. CASE SUMMARY : A 54-year-old-woman presented with symptoms of nausea and vomiting and was found to have a left atrial mass incidentally in addition to a renal infarct. She was also found to have COVID-19 and the mass was initially thought to be a thrombus. With the help of multimodality imaging, it was determined that the mass was an atrial myxoma and she was started on short-term anticoagulation to prevent recurrent embolization. After 6 weeks of anticoagulation, she successfully underwent elective resection of the mass which was confirmed to be myxoma with superimposed thrombus. DISCUSSION : It is difficult to differentiate cardiac tumours from intracardiac thrombus and multimodality cardiac imaging is crucial to make an accurate diagnosis. While the treatment of atrial myxomas involves early surgical resection, it becomes more complicated with concurrent COVID-19 infection.","Ranjan, Pragya; LaRocca, Gina; Sanz, Javier; Croft, Lori",Eur Heart J Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytab062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34104862/,311
673177,Thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients: A case series and literature review,2020,"An isotope pattern deconvolution (IPD) quantification method has been applied for the determination of five substances (amphetamine, benzoylecgonine, cocaine, methamphetamine and MDMA) in wastewater for the application in wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). A previously validated method that used a calibration curve for quantification was modified to apply IPD. The two approaches were compared in terms of analytical uncertainty in recovery studies of quality control samples, i.e. six wastewater samples from different geographical origins spiked at two concentration levels. Both methods were reliable as they passed (z-score < 2) in an interlaboratory exercise. After 60 individual determinations, IPD provided 11 results outside recovery limits (70–120%) while the previous method produced 31 adverse results. All mean values for IPD were accurate whereas 6 out of 10 results showed RSD values higher than 30% or recoveries outside limits when using the former method. Moreover, the calculated method bias for the latter doubles that of IPD, which, in turn, makes the combined uncertainty (u(c)) much higher. Consequently, a simple change of data treatment—IPD quantification methodology—resulted in a lower uncertainty of the estimated illicit drug concentration, one of the main steps contributing to the final uncertainty in the normalized daily drug consumption through WBE. The current study demonstrated that the employment of IPD can also be very interesting for future applications of WBE, especially when matrix effects are high, complicating accurate quantification. In addition, when a high number of samples and/or compounds need to be analysed, IPD is faster than calibration and, eventually, cost-effective when isotopically labelled internal standard is highly expensive.

The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to remain viable on surfaces and in aerosols, means indirect contact transmission can occur and so there is an opportunity to reduce transmission using effective disinfectants in public and communal spaces. Virusend (TX-10), a novel disinfectant, has been developed as a highly effective disinfectant against a range of microbial agents. Here we investigate the ability of Virusend (TX-10) to inactivation SARS-CoV-2. Using surface and solution inactivation assays, we show that Virusend (TX-10) is able to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral titre by 4log10 PFU/mL within 1 minute of contact. Ensuring disinfectants are highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 is important in eliminating environmental sources of the virus to control the COVID-19 pandemic.","Anderson, Enyia R.; Hughes, Grant L.; Patterson, Edward I.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33269346/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.25.394288,311
673812,Effectiveness of Convalescent Plasma Therapy in Severe or Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the worldwide need for simple remotely delivered (digital) scalable interventions that can also be used preventatively to protect the mental health of health care staff exposed to psychologically traumatic events during their COVID-19–related work. We have developed a brief behavioral intervention that aims to reduce the number of intrusive memories of traumatic events but has only been delivered face-to-face so far. After digitalizing the intervention materials, the intervention was delivered digitally to target users (health care staff) for the first time. The adaption for staff’s working context in a hospital setting used a co-design approach. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this mixed method exploratory pilot study with health care staff who experienced working in the pandemic were to pilot the intervention that we have digitalized (for remote delivery and with remote support) and adapted for this target population (health care staff working clinically during a pandemic) to explore its ability to reduce the number of intrusive memories of traumatic events and improve related symptoms (eg, posttraumatic stress) and participant’s perception of their functioning, and to explore the feasibility and acceptability of both the digitalized intervention and digitalized data collection. METHODS: We worked closely with target users with lived experience of working clinically during the COVID-19 pandemic in a hospital context (registered nurses who experienced intrusive memories from traumatic events at work; N=3). We used a mixed method design and exploratory quantitative and qualitative analysis. RESULTS: After completing the digitalized intervention once with remote researcher support (approximately 25 minutes) and a brief follow-up check-in, participants learned to use the intervention independently. All 3 participants reported zero intrusive memories during week 5 (primary outcome: 100% digital data capture). Prior to study inclusion, two or more intrusions in the week were reported preintervention (assessed retrospectively). There was a general pattern of symptom reduction and improvement in perceived functioning (eg, concentration) at follow-up. The digitalized intervention and data collection were perceived as feasible and rated as acceptable (eg, all 3 participants would recommend it to a colleague). Participants were positive toward the digital intervention as a useful tool that could readily be incorporated into work life and repeated in the face of ongoing or repeated trauma exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention when delivered remotely and adapted for this population during the pandemic was well received by participants. Since it could be tailored around work and daily life and used preventatively, the intervention may hold promise for health care staff pending future evaluations of efficacy. Limitations include the small sample size, lack of daily intrusion frequency data in the week before the intervention, and lack of a control condition. Following this co-design process in adapting and improving intervention delivery and evaluation, the next step is to investigate the efficacy of the digitalized intervention in a randomized controlled trial.","Singh, Laura; Kanstrup, Marie; Depa, Katherine; Falk, Ann-Charlotte; Lindström, Veronica; Dahl, Oili; Göransson, Katarina E; Rudman, Ann; Holmes, Emily A",JMIR Form Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33886490/; https://doi.org/10.2196/27473,311

We also revealed that glycyrrhizin inhibited the entry and replication of PEDV. In addition, we demonstrated that glycyrrhizin decreased the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Since glycyrrhizin is a competitive inhibitor of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), we confirmed that TLR4 and RAGE (£ associated with PEDV pathogenesis during the infection in Vero cells.

Although there are numerous screening and nutritional management protocols for malnutrition, only few studies have reported nutritional evolution after COVID-19. The objectives of this study were to describe the evolution of nutritional parameters between admission and 30 days after hospital discharge, and to determine predictive factors of poor nutritional outcome after recovery in adult COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this observational longitudinal study, we report findings after discharge in 91 out of 114 patients initially admitted for COVID-19 who received early nutritional management. Nutritional status was defined using GLIM criteria and compared between admission and day 30 after discharge. Baseline predictors of nutritional status at day 30 were assessed using logistic regression. Results: Thirty days after discharge, 28.6% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were malnourished, compared to 42.3% at admission. Half of malnourished patients (53%) at admission recovered a normal nutritional status after discharge. Weight trajectories were heterogeneous and differed if patients had been transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU) during hospitalization (p = 0.025). High oxygen requirement during hospitalization (invasive ventilation p = 0.016 (OR 8.3 [1.6–61.2]) and/or oxygen therapy over 5 L/min p = 0.021 (OR 3.2 [1.2–8.9]) were strong predictors of malnutrition one month after discharge. Conclusions: With early nutritional management, most patients hospitalized for COVID-19 improved nutritional parameters after discharge. These findings emphasize the importance of nutritional care in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in medicine departments, especially in those transferred from ICU.","Bedock, Dorothée; Couffignal, Julie; Bel Lassen, Pierre; Soares, Leila; Mathian, Alexis; Fadlallah, Jehane P.; Amoura, Zahir; Oppert, Jean-Michel; Faucher, Pauline",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34209229/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13072276,311

676150,COVID-19 with Hypoxic Respiratory Failure,2020-07-16,"Viruses are among the most common causes of opportunistic infection after solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SOT and HSCT). Viral infection is associated with both direct (invasive disease) and indirect (immune modulation) effects affecting susceptibility to other infections and promoting allograft rejection. The transplantation recipient is susceptible to a broad array of viral pathogens. Some may be transmitted with the allograft as donor-derived infections, while others result from exposure, either soon after the transplant or from more distant exposures when infection is latent and reactivates in the setting of immune suppression. Simultaneous infections with multiple viral or viral and nonviral pathogens are common. The risk for viral infection is a function of the intensity of exposure and virulence of the specific virus, the intensity of immune suppression used to prevent graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease, underlying immune deficits, and factors affecting host susceptibility. Studies of viral latency, reactivation, and of the cellular effects of viral infection will provide clues for future strategies in prevention and treatment of viral infections.

The clinical relevance of liver injury related to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear with a need for prospective studies on the impact of liver function test (LFT) abnormalities at baseline. DESIGN: Data of 217 patients without pre-existing liver disease prospectively included in the COVID-19 registry of the LMU university hospital were analysed in order to assess the association of abnormal LFT at admission and course of the disease. Severe course was defined as admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or as COVID-19-related death. RESULTS: Abnormal LFT at baseline was present in 58% of patients, with a predominant elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (42%), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) (37%) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (27%), hypoalbuminaemia was observed in 33%. Elevation of ALT and GGT, as well as hypoalbuminaemia, was associated with higher proportions of patients requiring ICU treatment and mechanical ventilation. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, hypoalbuminaemia combined with abnormal AST or GGT at hospital admission was a highly significant independent risk factor for ICU admission (OR 46.22 and 38.8, respectively) and for a composite endpoint of ICU admission and/or COVID-19-related death (OR 42.0 and 26.9, respectively).

At 12 h post-infection, the intracellular viral RNA load was 3 × 10(2)-fold higher than at the time of infection, and the extracellular viral RNA load was increased with a factor of 2 × 10(3). Intracellular viral RNA levels started to rise at 6 h post-infection. One hour later (at 7 h post-infection), the levels of extracellular SARS-CoV RNA also began to rise. This was corroborated by the fact that infectious progeny SARS-CoV also first appeared in the supernatant between 6 and 7 h post-infection. At 12 h post-infection, SARS-CoV reached titers in the supernatant of 5.2 × 10(3) CCID(50)/ml.","Keyaerts, Els; Vijgen, Leen; Maes, Piet; Neyts, Johan; Ranst, Marc Van",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15752773/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X05003438; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X05003438,311
679503,Innovation in Ambulatory Care of Heart Failure in the Era of COVID-19,2020-06-19,"Highly pathogenic human coronaviruses associated with a severe respiratory syndrome, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have recently emerged. The MERS-CoV epidemic started in 2012 and is still ongoing, with a mortality rate of approximately 35%. No vaccine is available against MERS-CoV and therapeutic options for MERS-CoV infections are limited to palliative and supportive care. A search for specific antiviral treatments is urgently needed. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses, with the spike proteins present on their surface responsible for virus entry into the target cell. Lectins are attractive anti-coronavirus candidates because of the highly glycosylated nature of the spike protein. We tested the antiviral effect of griffithsin (GRFT), a lectin isolated from the red marine alga Griffithsia sp. against MERS-CoV infection. Our results demonstrate that while displaying no significant cytotoxicity, griffithsin is a potent inhibitor of MERS-CoV infection. Griffithsin also inhibits entry into host cells of particles pseudotyped with the MERS-CoV spike protein, suggesting that griffithsin inhibits spike protein function during entry. Spike proteins have a dual function during entry, they mediate binding to the host cell surface and also the fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membrane. Time course experiments show that griffithsin inhibits MERS-CoV infection at the binding step. In conclusion, we identify griffithsin as a potent inhibitor of MERS-CoV infection at the entry step.","Millet, Jean K.; Séron, Karin; Labitt, Rachael N.; Danneels, Adeline; Palmer, Kenneth E.; Whittaker, Gary R.; Dubuisson, Jean; Belouzard, Sandrine",Antiviral Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216301723; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27424494/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.07.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216301723,311

The patient had chronic hepatitis B and history of exposure to poultry. The patient initially complained of diarrhea and influenza-like symptoms on March 7 and 14 respectively. The disease progressed to severe pneumonia, sustained hypoxia, and coagulation abnormalities. The patient died on March 27 because of respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation without oseltamivir treatment. This H7N9 virus from Zhejiang is highly similar to isolates obtained from Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, etc. Analysis of hemagglutinin, neuramidinase, and matrix genes indicated that the isolates share the same avian origin, have low virulence, and are sensitive to oseltamivir, but are resistant to adamantine. Only the isolate that caused the fatality exhibited substitution of Q226I in the HA gene, which indicates a potentially enhanced human affinity. The secondary transmission rate was 1.6% (2/125). Only two health workers presented with influenza-like symptoms, and they subsequently tested negative for H7N9 RNA. In conclusion, underlying disease, late diagnosis, and untimely antiviral treatment are possible high-risk factors for infections and death caused by the lowpathogenicity avian influenza A (H7N9). Person-to-person transmission of the H7N9 virus was not detected among close contacts, but such transmission should be investigated in the future. Expanding and enhancing surveillance will help in the early discovery and diagnosis of suspected cases, which will reduce the number of severe cases and deaths.","Chen, Enfu; Wang, Fenjuan; Lv, Huakun; Zhang, Yanjun; Ding, Hua; Liu, Shelan; Cai, Jian; Xie, Li; Xu, Xiaoping; Chai, Chengliang; Mao, Haiyan; Sun, Jimin; Lin, Junfen; Yu, Zhao; Li, Lianhong; Chen, Zhiping; Xia, Shichang",Front Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11684-013-0275-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23757033/,311

Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a major trans‐boundary disease in most Asian countries. Its sporadic re‐emergence suggests that collaborative FMD control strategies should be uniformly implemented in endemic countries to ensure the overall national herd vaccination coverage, biocontainment when outbreaks occur, and strict biosecurity control of animal movement between countries. Sustained commitments from governments, cooperative diplomatic relationships, and public awareness campaigns are critical to FMD control, to ensure collaboration among veterinarians, traders and farmers throughout Southeast Asia (SEA). Recently, highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (HP‐PRRS) and porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) spread from China to Southeast Asian countries, causing major economic losses. Foot and mouth disease, HP‐PRRS, and PED currently remain endemic and may continue to sporadically re‐emerge, owing to inadequate public health management and/or biosecurity failures. Therefore, the risk factors must be identified to better understand the epidemiology of these diseases in an effort to develop effective control measures. International coordination through the establishment of a collaborative network supported by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) should be implemented to prevent trans‐boundary transmission among countries. This review discusses trans‐boundary swine diseases of particular importance to SEA, including FMD, HP‐PRRS and PED, with a primary focus on major factors contributing to the spread of these diseases and important control measures, reflecting the impact of globalization on disease control and surveillance.","Na Ayudhya, S.

686250,Predicting severe outcomes using national early warning score (NEWS) in patients identified by a rapid response system: a retrospective cohort study,2021-09-09,"BACKGROUND: Dicer is a 219-kDa protein that plays key roles in gene regulation, particularly as the ribonuclease III enzyme responsible for cleaving precursor miRNA substrates. Its enzymatic activity is highly regulated by protein factors, and this regulation can impact on the levels of miRNAs and modulate the behavior of a cell. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of regulation, detailed enzymatic and structural characterization of Dicer are needed. However, these types of studies generally require several milligrams of recombinant protein, and efficient preparation of such quantities of pure human Dicer remains a challenge. To prepare large quantities of human Dicer, we have optimized transfection in HEK293-6E cells grown in suspension and streamlined a purification procedure. RESULTS: Transfection conditions were first optimized to achieve expression levels between 10 and 18 mg of recombinant Dicer per liter of culture. A three-step purification protocol was then developed that yields 4–9 mg of purified Dicer per liter of culture in a single day. From SEC-MALS/RI analysis and negative stain TEM, we confirmed that the purified protein is monomerically pure ( ≥ 98%) and folds with the characteristic L-shape geometry. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 5 nM was measured for Dicer binding to pre-let-7a-1, in agreement with previous reports. However, when probing the cleavage activity of Dicer for pre-let-7a-1, we measured k(cat) (7.2 ± 0.5 min(− 1)) and K(M) (1.2 ± 0.3 μM) values that are much higher than previously reported due to experimental conditions that better respect the steady-state assumption. CONCLUSIONS: The expression and purification protocols described here provide high yields of monomerically pure and active human Dicer. Cleavage studies of a pre-let-7 substrate with this purified Dicer reveal higher k(cat) and K(M) values than previously reported and support the current view that conformational changes are associated with substrate binding. Large quantities of highly pure Dicer will be valuable for future biochemical, biophysical and structural investigations of this key protein of the miRNA pathway.

Thus, we aimed to investigate the association between prediabetes with dietary quality and DTAC. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted on 49 patients with prediabetes and 98 controls. Demographics, anthropometric measures, and fasting blood glucose levels of all participants were obtained. Participants completed a validated 80-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). DTAC scores were generated using FFQ data, and Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) was used as a diet quality index. The lowest tertile of HEI-2015 and DTAC was considered as the reference category, and logistic regression was used to estimate the relationship between prediabetes with HEI-215 and DTAC. RESULTS: Mean age and body mass index of participants were 47.42 ± 15.98 years and 27.90 ± 4.96 kg/m(2). Patients with prediabetes had lower DTAC scores when compared to controls (11.86 ± 5.77 and 17.81 ± 12.08, P = 0.01).

The study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on medical student’s psychological well-being in Pakistan. Following ethical approval, an online survey developed in collaboration with World Psychiatric Association (WPA) was distributed among medical students of 5 Medical colleges in the Punjab province of Pakistan between August and September 2020. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and Risk Assessment Suicidality Scale (RASS) were used to assess psychological well-being. Data was analyzed using SPSS 26.0. RESULTS: Eleven hundred medical students responded, 756 (69%) being females. More than 2/3rd admitted that their emotional state got worse in relation to appearance of anxiety, insecurity, and sadness, compared to before the outbreak of COVID-19. Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms were 48.6% and 48.1%, respectively. Female medical students, pre-clinical students, and those with a previous psychiatric history reported experiencing more anxiety and depression symptoms (P value < 0.001). One in five medical students thought that it would be better if they were dead, and 8% admitted to often think of committing suicide during the past 2 weeks. RASS and subscales (intention, life, and history) scores were higher in females and students with previous psychiatric problems. CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore that the impact of COVID-19 on medical students has been significant; hence, it is crucial for medical colleges to employ strategies to maintain the student’s well-being with safeguards like reassurance, support, and confidential student-centered psychiatric services. The use of virtual platforms (websites, email) to educate and screen students by staff members can create a positive impact. The limitations of this study include cross-sectional design, the possibility of selective participation being web-based survey, response bias, and the possibility of reluctance of students to report mental health problems due to stigma.","Imran, Nazish; Haider, Imran Ijaz; Mustafa, Ali Burhan; Aamer, Irum; Kamal, Zahid; Rasool, Ghulam; Azeem, Muhammad Waqar; Javed, Afzal",Middle East Curr Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43045-021-00123-7,311

We aimed to track molecular evolution and spread of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Esteio (Southern Brazil) using phylogenetics and phylodynamics inferences from 21 new genomes in global and regional context. Importantly, the case fatality rate (CFR) in Esteio (3.26%) is slightly higher compared to the Rio Grande do Sul (RS) state (2.56%) and the entire Brazil (2.74%). RESULTS: We provided a comprehensive view of mutations from a representative sampling from May to October 2020, highlighting two frequent mutations in spike glycoprotein (D614G and V1176F), an emergent mutation (E484K) in spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) characteristic of the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages, and the adjacent replacement of 2 amino acids in Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (R203K and G204R). E484K was found in two genomes from mid-October, which is the earliest description of this mutation in Southern Brazil. Lineages containing this substitution must be subject of intense surveillance due to its association with immune evasion. We also found two epidemiologically-related clusters, including one from patients of the same neighborhood. Phylogenetics and phylodynamics analysis demonstrates multiple introductions of the Brazilian most prevalent lineages (B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.248) and the establishment of Brazilian lineages ignited from the Southeast to other Brazilian regions.

687575,Comorbidities for fatal outcome among the COVID-19 patients: a hospital-based case-control study,2020-07-27,"The Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disproportionally impacted historically disadvantaged populations, with infection and mortality rates among Black and Latinx Americans far exceeding the proportion of the population that these groups represent. We, as researchers, educators, and critical care and pulmonary providers on the frontline of care for all individuals, believe it is important to reflect on the root causes for these striking disparities. Moreover, recent incidences of structural violence highlight the need to recognize the critical role of racism in causing and perpetuating health disparities. Without attention to the underlying causes, it is difficult to enact equitable action. Applying the World Health Organization Conceptual Framework for Action, we examine the social and structural determinants of health (SDOH) that contributed to disparities in the care and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Applying this lens, we identify three potential critical targets for action: 1) increased exposure due to occupation and/or living circumstances that make social distancing and self-isolation more difficult, 2) limited access to accurate, up to date information regarding the health risks of COVID-19, and 3) limited and differential access to healthcare services, including coronavirus testing and care. In this perspective, we focus on action steps that we, as members of the American Thoracic Society, should take to actively change the status quo and influence policies that address root causes.

688380,Manifestations and Virus Detection in the Ocular Surface of Adult COVID-19 Patients: A Meta-Analysis,2021-06-19,"Methods that predict antibody epitopes could help to promote the development of diagnostic tools, vaccines or immunotherapies by affecting the epitope binding of antibodies during an immunological response to antigens. It is generally assumed that there is a direct relationship between antibody accessibility to antigens and accessible surface of proteins. Based on this assumption, prediction systems often includes solvent accessibility values calculated from the primary sequence of proteins or from their three dimensional structures as a predictive criterion. However, the current prediction systems seem weakly efficient in view of benchmark tests. We were interested in evaluating how amino acids that have been experimentally identified as epitopic elements could differ from the rest of the antigenic molecule at the level of surface exposure, hence we assessed the average accessibility of epitopes. The approach used here utilises published epitopes deduced from numerous identification techniques, including sequence scanning and structure visualisation after crystallography, and it involves many types of antigens from toxins to allergens. Our results show that epitopic residues are not distributed among any specific Relative Surface Accessibility and Protrusion Index values and that, in some cases, epitopes cover the entire antigenic sequence. These results led to the conclusion that the classification of known epitopes with respect to the experimental conditions used to identify them should be introduced before attempting to characterise epitopic areas in a generic way.","Lollier, Virginie; Denery-Papini, Sandra; Larré, Colette; Tessier, Dominique",Mol Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2010.10.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589010005912; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21111484/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589010005912,311

This study applies a similar approach to an aspect of road safety: the use of smartphones while driving. A representative sample of 1706 subjects answered a series of questions related to what can be regarded as erroneous or conspiracy beliefs against restricting or banning the use of smartphones while driving. The results show that those having such conspiracy beliefs reported a greater use of smartphones behind the wheel.,"Valero-Mora, Pedro M.; Zacarés, Juan José; Sánchez-García, Mar; Tormo-Lancero, María Teresa; Faus, Mireia",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360021/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18157725,311
689631,An observational cohort study of bacterial co-infection and implications for empirical antibiotic therapy in patients presenting with COVID-19 to hospitals in North West London,2020-11-13,"The COVID-19 pandemic has surprised the entire population. The world has had to face an unprecedented pandemic. Only, Spanish flu had similar disastrous consequences. As a result, drastic measures (lockdown) have been adopted worldwide. Healthcare service has been overwhelmed by the extraordinary influx of patients, often requiring high intensity of care. Mortality has been associated with severe comorbidities, including chronic diseases. Patients with frailty were, therefore, the victim of the SARS-COV-2 infection. Allergy and asthma are the most prevalent chronic disorders in children and adolescents, so they need careful attention and, if necessary, an adaptation of their regular treatment plans. Fortunately, at present, young people are less suffering from COVID-19, both as incidence and severity. However, any age, including infancy, could be affected by the pandemic. Based on this background, the Italian Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology has felt it necessary to provide a Consensus Statement. This expert panel consensus document offers a rationale to help guide decision-making in the management of children and adolescents with allergic or immunologic diseases.","Cardinale, Fabio; Ciprandi, Giorgio; Barberi, Salvatore; Bernardini, Roberto; Caffarelli, Carlo; Calvani, Mauro; Cavagni, Giovanni; Galli, Elena; Minasi, Domenico; del Giudice, Michele Miraglia; Moschese, Viviana; Novembre, Elio; Paravati, Francesco; Peroni, Diego G.; Tosca, Maria Angela; Traina, Giovanni; Tripodi, Salvatore; Marseglia, Gian Luigi",Ital J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32546234/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13052-020-00843-2,311

While most infected individuals have an asymptomatic or mild disease, a minority, mainly the elderly, develop a severe disease that may lead to a fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS results from a highly inflammatory immunopathology process that includes systemic manifestations and massive alveolar damages that impair gas exchange. The present review summarizes our current knowledge in the rapidly evolving field of SARS-CoV-2 immunopathology, emphasizing the role of specific T cell responses. Indeed, accumulating evidence suggest that while T-cell response directed against SARS-CoV-2 likely plays a crucial role in virus clearance, it may also participate in the immunopathology process that leads to ARDS.","Taoufik, Yassine; de Goër de Herve, Marie-Ghislaine; Corgnac, Stéphanie; Durrbach, Antoine; Mami-Chouaib, Fathia",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34630382/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.692598,311
