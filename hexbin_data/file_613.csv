11382,11382,11382,Anti-inflammatory coating of hernia repair meshes: a 5-rabbit study,9.896955,3.5840418,2020-02-05,"PURPOSE: Indications and optimal timing for tracheostomy in traumatic brain-injured (TBI) patients are uncertain. This study aims to describe the patients’ characteristics, timing, and factors related to the decision to perform a tracheostomy and differences in strategies among different countries and assess the effect of the timing of tracheostomy on patients’ outcomes. METHODS: We selected TBI patients from CENTER-TBI, a prospective observational longitudinal cohort study, with an intensive care unit stay ≥ 72 h. Tracheostomy was defined as early (≤ 7 days from admission) or late (> 7 days). We used a Cox regression model to identify critical factors that affected the timing of tracheostomy. The outcome was assessed at 6 months using the extended Glasgow Outcome Score. RESULTS: Of the 1358 included patients, 433 (31.8%) had a tracheostomy. Age (hazard rate, HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.01–1.07, p = 0.003), Glasgow coma scale ≤ 8 (HR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.22–2.36 at 7; p < 0.001), thoracic trauma (HR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.01–1.52, p = 0.020), hypoxemia (HR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.05–1.79, p = 0.048), unreactive pupil (HR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.27–2.45 at 7; p < 0.001) were predictors for tracheostomy. Considerable heterogeneity among countries was found in tracheostomy frequency (7.9–50.2%) and timing (early 0–17.6%). Patients with a late tracheostomy were more likely to have a worse neurological outcome, i.e., mortality and poor neurological sequels (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.07–2.67, p = 0.018), and longer length of stay (LOS) (38.5 vs. 49.4 days, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Tracheostomy after TBI is routinely performed in severe neurological damaged patients. Early tracheostomy is associated with a better neurological outcome and reduced LOS, but the causality of this relationship remains unproven.

The hypothesis of directed co-aggregation of the target protein and an amyloidogenic peptide acting as an antimicrobial peptide was successfully tested for peptides synthesized on the basis of ribosomal S1 protein in the bacterial culture of T. thermophilus. Co-aggregation of the target protein and amyloidogenic peptide was also tested for the pathogenic ribosomal S1 protein from P. aeruginosa. Almost all peptides that we selected as AMPs, prone to aggregation and formation of fibrils, based on the amino acid sequence of ribosomal S1 protein from E. coli, T. thermophilus, P. aeruginosa, formed amyloid fibrils. We have demonstrated that amyloidogenic peptides are not only toxic to their target cells, but also some of them have antimicrobial activity. Controlling the aggregation of vital bacterial proteins can become one of the new directions of research and form the basis for the search and development of targeted antibacterial drugs.","Galzitskaya, Oxana V.",Front Mol Biosci,613,1

As marketing channels, animal movement, and reporting requirements become increasingly national and international, the need to communicate about laboratory tests and results grows. Local and proprietary names of laboratory tests often fail to communicate enough detail to distinguish between similar tests. To avoid a lengthy description of each test, laboratories need the ability to assign codes that, although not sufficiently user-friendly for day-to-day use, contain enough information to translate between laboratories and even languages. The Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) standard provides such a universal coding system. Each test-each atomic observation-is evaluated on 6 attributes that establish its uniqueness at the level of clinical-or epidemiologic-significance. The analyte detected, analyte property, specimen, and result scale combine with the method of analysis and timing (for challenge and metabolic type tests) to define a unique LOINC code. Equipping laboratory results with such universal identifiers creates a world of opportunity for cross-institutional data exchange, aggregation, and analysis, and presents possibilities for data mining and artificial intelligence on a national and international scale. A few challenges, relatively unique to regulatory veterinary test protocols, require special handling.","Martin, Michael K","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",613,5

However, the range of analytical procedures available to evaluate these profiles remains limited and are typically based on transesterification of the triglyceride fatty acid residues to methyl esters, followed by capillary gas-liquid chromatography (GC) coupled with flame ionization or mass spectrometry detection. Although robust and long-proven, these analytical methods tend to entail long chromatographic runs and are relatively insensitive. In order to expand the range of available techniques for the analysis of the fatty acid profile of triglycerides in vegetable oils, we report herein a novel method based upon a rapid and straightforward transesterification of the triglycerides with dimethylaminoethanol under alkaline conditions, followed by a ""dilute-and-shoot"" analysis by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The chromatographic analysis is accomplished in 1.5 min, affording a high throughput of samples compared to techniques based upon GC approaches. The method performance was assessed intra- and inter-day with 10 representative saturated and unsaturated fatty acids ranging from C8 to C18 and afforded fatty acid profile accuracies of 93-108% and imprecisions of only 0.3-2.0%. The limit of quantification of the method, estimated as the minimum amount of derivatized oil sample capable of affording less than 20% accuracy and precision error was determined to be approximately 0.5 pg on-column, making this new method potentially valuable for fields where high sensitivity, precision, and accuracy may be required, such as in toxicology studies, forensics, archeology, or art analysis.","Nagumalli, Suresh K; Jacob, Cristina C; Gamboa da Costa, Gonçalo","Journal of chromatography.

Therapies targeting this population were a recent addition to the multiple sclerosis (MS) drugs portfolio. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the risk of severe COVID-19 have challenged the safety of B cell depletion in MS patients. STATE OF THE ART Selective depletion of B cells by monoclonal antibodies as monotherapy in MS has been shown to profoundly suppress disease activity among relapsing-remitting MS patients. Furthermore ocrelizumab, a humanised anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, was the first licensed therapy in primary progressive MS. Based on the concept of the role of B cells in MS, many therapeutic approaches are emerging as novel ways to treat autoimmune demyelination. However, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a conservative approach toward limiting immune suppression in MS patients has been proposed. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Emerging evidence does not support the notion of increased susceptibility among MS patients to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, or any predisposition toward greater severity of COVID-19. This also does not appear to be the case for MS patients undergoing B cell depletion therapies. Thus, any decision to withhold immune suppression in MS patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is probably incorrect. MS therapeutic decision-making should focus on the danger of poorly controlled autoimmune demyelination rather than perceived risks from COVID-19. FUTURE DIRECTIONS The current pandemic highlights the need to develop more selective and safer methods of immunomodulation in MS. B cells represent several functionally different populations. Further research into the different role of these cells during autoimmune demyelination should yield better, safer strategies to control the encephalitogenic process.","Mycko, Marcin P",Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska,613,26

The typical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, headache and fatigue. However, atypical presentations of COVID-19 are being increasingly reported. Recently, a number of studies have recognized various mucocutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19. This study sought to summarize the available literature and provide an overview of the potential orofacial manifestations of COVID-19. An online literature search in the PubMed and Scopus databases was conducted to retrieve the relevant studies published up to July 2020. Original studies published in English that reported orofacial manifestations in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included; this yielded 16 articles involving 25 COVID-19-positive patients. The results showed a marked heterogeneity in COVID-19-associated orofacial manifestations. The most common orofacial manifestations were ulcerative lesions, vesiculobullous/macular lesions, and acute sialadentitis of the parotid gland (parotitis). In four cases, oral manifestations were the first signs of COVID-19. In summary, COVID-19 may cause orofacial manifestations that might be the initial features in several cases. However, the occurrence of orofacial manifestations in COVID-19 seems to be underreported, mainly due to the lack of oral examination of patients with suspected and/or confirmed COVID-19. Oral examination of all suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases is crucial for better understanding and documenting COVID-19-associated orofacial manifestations.","Halboub, Esam; Al-Maweri, Sadeq Ali; Alanazi, Rawan Hejji; Qaid, Nashwan Mohammed; Abdulrab, Saleem",Brazilian oral research,613,1

However, oral fluoropyrimidine monotherapy is used for some part of patients, especially in Asian countries including Japan, and its optimal duration is yet to be fully investigated. METHODS A total of 1306 patients with curatively-resected stage III CRC were randomly assigned to receive capecitabine (2500 mg/m2/day) for 14 out of 21 days for 6 (n = 654) or 12 (n = 650) months. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS), and the secondary endpoints were relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events. RESULTS The 3- and 5-year DFS were 70.0% and 65.3% in the 6M group and 75.3% and 68.7% in the 12M group, respectively (p = 0.0549, HR = 0.858, 90% CI: 0.732-1.004). The 5-year RFS was 69.3% and 74.1% in the 6M and 12M groups, respectively (p = 0.0143, HR = 0.796, 90% CI: 0.670-0.945). The 5-year OS was 83.2% and 87.6%, respectively (p = 0.0124, HR = 0.727, 90% CI: 0.575-0.919). The incidence of overall grade 3-4 adverse events was almost comparable in both groups. CONCLUSIONS Although 12-month adjuvant capecitabine did not demonstrate superior DFS to that of 6-month, the observed better RFS and OS in the 12-month treatment period could be of value in selected cases.","Tomita, Naohiro; Kunieda, Katsuyuki; Maeda, Atsuyuki; Hamada, Chikuma; Yamanaka, Takeharu; Sato, Toshihiko; Yoshida, Kazuhiro; Boku, Narikazu; Nezu, Riichiro; Yamaguchi, Shigeki; Mishima, Hideyuki; Sadahiro, Sotaro; Muro, Kei; Ishiguro, Megumi; Sakamoto, Junichi; Saji, Shigetoyo; Maehara, Yoshihiko",British journal of cancer,613,29

It has been suggested that an influenza source population located in tropical Southeast or East Asia seeds annual temperate epidemics. Here we investigate the seasonal dynamics and migration patterns of influenza A H3N2 virus by analysis of virus samples obtained from 2003 to 2006 from Australia, Europe, Japan, New York, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, and newly sequenced viruses from Hong Kong. In contrast to annual temperate epidemics, relatively low levels of relative genetic diversity and no seasonal fluctuations characterized virus populations in tropical Southeast Asia and Hong Kong. Bayesian phylogeographic analysis using discrete temporal and spatial characters reveal high rates of viral migration between urban centers tested. Although the virus population that migrated between Southeast Asia and Hong Kong persisted through time, this was dependent on virus input from temperate regions and these tropical regions did not maintain a source for annual H3N2 influenza epidemics. We further show that multiple lineages may seed annual influenza epidemics, and that each region may function as a potential source population. We therefore propose that the global persistence of H3N2 influenza A virus is the result of a migrating metapopulation in which multiple different localities may seed seasonal epidemics in temperate regions in a given year. Such complex global migration dynamics may confound control efforts and contribute to the emergence and spread of antigenic variants and drug-resistant viruses.","Bahl, Justin; Nelson, Martha I; Chan, Kwok H; Chen, Rubing; Vijaykrishna, Dhanasekaran; Halpin, Rebecca A; Stockwell, Timothy B; Lin, Xudong; Wentworth, David E; Ghedin, Elodie; Guan, Yi; Peiris, J S Malik; Riley, Steven; Rambaut, Andrew; Holmes, Edward C; Smith, Gavin J D",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,613,31

A multicenter phase 2 clinical trial of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis in children hospitalized with COVID-19-related illness has recently been initiated in the United States. To date, there remains a paucity of high-quality evidence to inform clinical practice world-wide. Therefore, the objective of this scientific statement is to provide consensus-based recommendations on the use of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis in children hospitalized for COVID-19-related illnesses, and to identify priorities for future research. METHODS We surveyed 20 pediatric hematologists and pediatric critical care physicians from several continents who were identified by Pediatric/Neonatal Hemostasis and Thrombosis Subcommittee leadership as having experience and expertise in the use of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis and/or the management of COVID-19-related illness in children. A comprehensive review of the literature on COVID-19 in children was also performed. RESULTS Response rate was 90%. Based on consensus of expert opinions, we suggest the administration of low-dose low molecular weight heparin subcutaneously twice-daily as anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis (in the absence of contraindications, and in combination with mechanical thromboprophylaxis with sequential compression devices, where feasible) in children hospitalized for COVID-19-related illness (including the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children [MIS-C]) who have markedly elevated D-dimer levels or superimposed clinical risk factors for hospitalassociated VTE. For children who are clinically unstable or have severe renal impairment, we suggest the use of unfractionated heparin by continuous intravenous infusion as anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. In addition, continued efforts to characterize VTE risk and risk factors in children with COVID-19, as well as to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis strategies in children hospitalized with COVID-19-related illness (including MIS-C) via cooperative multicenter trials, were identified among several key priorities for future research. CONCLUSION These consensus-based recommendations on the use of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis in children hospitalized for COVID-19-related illnesses and priorities for future research will be updated as high-quality evidence emerges.","Goldenberg, Neil A; Sochet, Anthony; Albisetti, Manuela; Biss, Tina; Bonduel, Mariana; Jaffray, Julie; MacLaren, Graeme; Monagle, Paul; O'Brien, Sarah; Raffini, Leslie; Revel-Vilk, Shoshana; Sirachainan, Nongnuch; Williams, Suzan; Zia, Ayesha; Male, Christoph",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,613,20

However, this research is not only widely disparate but, despite its growth, has not been reviewed since 2012. Our objective was to identify, summarize, and methodologically evaluate studies quantifying the psychosocial effects of assistance dogs for individuals with physical disabilities. Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review was conducted across seven electronic databases. Records were independently screened by two authors. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they assessed outcomes from guide, hearing, medical, or mobility service dogs, if they collected original data on handlers' psychosocial functioning, and if the outcome was measured quantitatively with a validated, standardized measure. Studies on psychiatric service dogs, emotional support dogs, and pet dogs were excluded. Of 1,830 records screened, 24 articles were identified (12 publications, 12 theses) containing 27 studies (15 cross-sectional, 12 longitudinal). Studies assessed the effects of mobility (18), hearing (7), guide (4), and medical (2) assistance dog partnerships with an average sample size of N = 83. An analysis of 147 statistical comparisons across the domains of psychological health, quality of life, social health, and vitality found that 68% of comparisons were null, 30% were positive in the hypothesized direction, and 2% were negative. Positive outcomes included significant effects of having an assistance dog on psychological wellbeing, emotional functioning, self-esteem, and vitality. However, it is of note that several methodological weaknesses of the studies make it difficult to draw any definitive conclusions, including inadequate reporting and a failure to account for moderating or confounding variables. Future research will benefit from stronger methodological rigor and reporting to account for heterogeneity in both humans and assistance dogs as well as continued high-quality replication.","Rodriguez, Kerri E; Greer, Jamie; Yatcilla, Jane K; Beck, Alan M; O'Haire, Marguerite E",PloS one,613,31

Our study investigated the efficacy of a supplement with Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and Luteolin to support recovery of olfaction in COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a randomized-controlled pilot study in outpatients with history of confirmed COVID-19 with post-infection olfactory impairment that persisted ≥ 90 days after SARS-CoV-2 negative testing. Patients were randomized to two times a day olfactory rehabilitation alone or weekly olfactory rehabilitation plus daily oral supplement with PEA and Luteolin. Subjects with preexisting olfactory disorders were excluded. Sniffin' Sticks assessments were performed at baseline and 30 days after treatment. Data on gender, age, and time since infection were collected. Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test was used to compare variances of Sniff scores between groups over time, and Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated to assess for correlations between Sniff Score and gender or duration of infection. RESULTS Among 12 patients enrolled (n=7, supplement; n=5, controls), patients receiving supplement had greater improvement in olfactory threshold, discrimination, and identification score versus controls (p=0.01). Time since infection was negatively correlated with Sniff Score, and there was no correlation between gender. CONCLUSIONS Treatment combining olfactory rehabilitation with oral supplementation with PEA and Luteolin was associated with improved recovery of olfactory function, most marked in those patients with longstanding olfactory dysfunction. Further studies are necessary to replicate these findings and to determine whether early intervention including olfactory rehabilitation and PEA+Luteolin oral supplement might prevent SARS-CoV-2 associated olfactory impairment.","Sansone, M; Zaami, S; Cetta, L; Costanzi, F; Signore, F",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,613,31

We aimed to analyze tweets on COVID-19 and smoking coming from casual Twitter users and Twitter accounts representing the tobacco industry. We collected tweets on COVID-19 and smoking from January 1 to May 1, 2020, using Twitter application programming interface. We analyzed sentiment, likes, or retweet to followers ratios, and the posts coming from the casual users to find pieces of news that could affect the discourse. Tweets coming from industry were analyzed manually. We analyzed n = 33,890 tweets on COVID-19 and smoking. The sentiment of tweets was negative, hitting a nadir in mid-March, but became less negative in April when preprints suggesting benefits from smoking on COVID-19 were released. Similar trends were observed for the ratios of likes or retweets to followers. We found 58 messages from the tobacco industry concerning COVID-19. Twenty-two (37.9 percent) mentioned the efforts of tobacco companies to support the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Two tweets included Food and Drug Administration statements that there is no evidence that vaping increases the risk of COVID-19. The occurrence of preprints suggesting benefits of smoking in COVID-19 might increase sentiment and reactions to tweets on tobacco products and the virus. The authors of potentially controversial articles should restrain from the promotion of their results before the completion of the peer-review process.

One important aspect of transplantation is the accessibility to track and control the activity of the stem cells-derived neurons post-transplantation. Recently, the characteristics of organic nanoparticles (NPs) with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) have emerged as efficient cell labeling reagents, where positive outcomes were observed in long-term cancer cell tracing in vivo. In the current study, we designed, synthesized, and analyzed the biocompatibility of AIE-NPs in cultured neurons such as in mouse neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) and hESC-derived neurons. Our data demonstrated that AIE-NPs show high degree of penetration into cells and presented intracellular long-term retention in vitro without altering the neuronal proliferation, differentiation, and viability. Furthermore, we have tracked AIE-NPs labeled neuronal grafts in mouse brain striatum in various time points post-transplantation. We demonstrated prolonged cellular retention of AIE-NPs labeled neuronal grafts 1 month post-transplantation in mouse brain striatum. Lastly, we have shown activation of brain microglia in response to AIE-NPs labeled grafts. Together, these findings highlight the potential application of AIE-NPs in neuronal transplantation.","Jang, Se Eun; Qiu, Lifeng; Cai, Xiaolei; Lee, Jolene Wei Ling; Zhang, Wei; Tan, Eng-King; Liu, Bin; Zeng, Li",Biomaterials,613,1

There remain important gaps and deficiencies in quality assurance efforts, including potential conflicts of interest. While many definitions for quality exist, a common component is that meeting the needs of the ""beneficiary"" or ""client"" is the ultimate determinant of quality. This paper examines the current status of assessment and accountability practices in the humanitarian response community, identifies gaps, and recommends timely, concise, and population-based assessments to elicit the perspective of quality performance and accountability to the affected populations.

In this article a new prediction tool is presented in combination of Turkish experience during pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS Laboratory and clinical data of 397 over 798 confirmed COVID-19 patients from Gülhane Training and Research Hospital electronic medical record system were included into this retrospective cohort study between the dates of 23 March to 18 May 2020. Patient demographics, peripheral venous blood parameters, symptoms at admission, in hospital mortality data were collected. Non-survivor and survivor patients were compared to find out a prediction scoring model for mortality. RESULTS There was 34 [8.56% (95% CI:0.06-0.11)] mortality during study period. Mean age of patients was 57.1±16.7 years. Older age, comorbid diseases, symptoms, such as fever, dyspnea, fatigue and gastrointestinal and WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of patients in non-survivors were significantly higher. Univariate analysis demonstrated that OR for prognostic nutritional index (PNI) tertile 1 was 18.57 (95% CI: 4.39-78.65, p<0.05) compared to tertile 2. Performance statistics of prediction scoring method showed 98% positive predictive value for criteria 1. CONCLUSIONS It is crucial to constitute prognostic clinical and laboratory parameters for faster delineation of patients who are prone to worse prognosis.

In the presence of small tumour tissue sample, the pathologist needs to make responsible choices to achieve a correct diagnosis and save material for subsequent molecular evaluations. Nevertheless, in some instances, the diagnostic process can lead to tissue depletion. The automated Idylla epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation test has been developed to rapidly process formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) pathologic material, without previous DNA extraction. This study aimed to test whether this platform is suitable for the reuse of H&E, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) diagnostic slides. METHODS A training set of 19 FFPE tissues with known EGFR status was revaluated on H&E slides. Fourteen of them were also tested using IHC and FISH treated specimens. An additional series of 25 H&E, IHC or FISH slides of NSCLC cases tested for EGFR mutation at an external institution was blindly assessed as a validation cohort. RESULTS Combining the two sets, 32 of 32 classical ex19dels and p.L858R were correctly identified. Three uncommon mutations (p.G719X, p.L861Q and ex20ins) were also detected. Four discrepancies were related to rare ex19del/ins not included in the Idylla list of detectable mutations. Two p.T790M variants were missed on one FFPE and two H&E slides but were detected using IHC and FISH sections from the same FFPE blocks. CONCLUSIONS The Idylla EGFR mutation test is highly reliable using differently treated tumour specimens and should be validated in larger studies.","Nunnari, Josè; Graziano, Paolo; Muscarella, Lucia Anna; Rossi, Antonio; Grillo, Lucia Rosalba; Montrone, Giuseppe; Di Lorenzo, Angela; Bronzini, Monica; Leone, Alvaro",Journal of clinical pathology,613,6

Failure of peritoneal closure is rare but can lead to herniation and bowel obstruction. A new wound closure device named V-Loc was tested in this study. It consists of a barbed absorbable thread that is self-anchoring and eliminates the need to tie a knot. The efficacy of this device in achieving secure peritoneal closure was investigated. METHODS In 10 recently deceased patients, peritoneal incisions were set and closed with 5 different devices including V-Loc. Peritoneal thickness was measured prior to testing. A tensiometer was used to apply tensile loads on the peritoneal closure. Tensile loads were measured in Newton at the time of peritoneal rupture or failure of the suture or knot. RESULTS Peritoneal thickness had a significant impact on the results (P < .0001). A mean tensile load of 7.41 N was tolerated when the peritoneal thickness was ≤0.25 mm and 15.38 N when the peritoneal thickness was >0.25 mm. Peritoneal rupture was observed more often than failure of closure. The latter occurred more often at high tension and in experiments with tacking or stapling devices than with sutures. While testing V-Loc, peritoneal rupture occurred at 19.85 N, mean, showing significantly better results than AbsorbaTack, extracorporally knotted running suture, or Multifire Endo Hernia Stapler (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS The new wound closure device V-Loc is a feasible and promising alternative to common peritoneal closure techniques but is yet to be evaluated in clinical studies.","Patri, Philipp; Beran, Claudia; Stjepanovic, Josipa; Sandberg, Simone; Tuchmann, Albert; Christian, Hollinsky",Surgical innovation,613,29

Researchers have shown that breastfeeding may reduce diabetes risk in women with recent gestational diabetes. RESEARCH AIM To assess association between infant feeding and postpartum glucose tolerance in mothers with recent gestational diabetes within 1 year postpartum. METHODS A literature search was performed up to December 31, 2019, retrieving articles related to infant feeding, gestational diabetes, and postpartum glucose regulation in four major databases (PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Embase). Methodological quality was assessed using tools from the United States National Institutes of Health and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. RESULTS The search yielded 15 cohort studies meeting the selection criteria. Of the 15 studies, 13 (86.7%) examined the influence of breastfeeding on postpartum glycemic status, and eight (53.4%) compared the mean blood glucose values between breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding participants. Of the 13 studies that compared postpartum glycemic status, nine (60%) of the research teams found that breastfeeding lowered rates of impaired glucose tolerance, and four (26.7%) showed no significant change. In eight of the studies reporting mean blood glucose values, six (75%) reported significantly lower fasting plasma glucose in breastfeeding participants, with reductions ranging from 3.7 to 7.4 mg/dL (0.2-0.4 mmol/L). CONCLUSION Breastfeeding has been associated with improved postpartum glucose regulation in mothers with gestational diabetes. In pregnant women with gestational diabetes, breastfeeding may reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes, and women with gestational diabetes should be strongly encouraged and supported to breastfeed.","Tarrant, Marie; Chooniedass, Rishma; Fan, Heidi Sze Lok; Del Buono, Katie; Masina, Stephanie",Journal of human lactation : official journal of International Lactation Consultant Association,613,31

Hence, we elaborated on the relationship between β-catenin expression and BC through a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. As of March 2020, EMBASE, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Science Direct/Elsevier, MEDLINE and CNKI were used for systematic literature retrieval to investigate the correlation between β-catenin expression and BC. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager and Stata software. Fourteen studies were included, including 865 BC tissues and 106 controls. Combined ORs were identified with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) in a random- or fixed-effects model. We illustrated that there was a significant correlation between β-catenin and BC, that there was abnormally high expression of β-catenin in BC tissues compared with normal bladder tissues (P<0.05), and that the combined OR was 14.69[5.73, 37.65]. Furthermore, the aberrant expression rates of β-catenin in high-grade and invasive bladder neoplasm tissues were greater than those in low-grade and non-muscle-invasive bladder tissues (P<0.05), and the combined ORs were 0.31[0.23, 0.43] and 0.21[0.15, 0.29]. Finally, we found through meta-analysis that the higher the expression level of β-catenin, the shorter was the progression-free survival of patients with BC (P<0.05), and the combined OR was 2.74[1.22, 6.14]. This study suggests that the abnormal expression of β-catenin is associated with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis of BC, and β-catenin may be a molecular marker of the malignant degree and poor prognosis of BC.","Ren, Jin; Yang, Yaodong; Peng, Taifang; Xu, Dong",Bioscience reports,613,16

The entry of SARS-CoV-2 is accomplished via ACE-2 receptors. SARS-CoV-2 infection coactivates both innate and adaptive immune responses. Although SARS-CoV-2 stimulates antibody production with a typical pattern of IgM/IgG, cellular immunity is also impaired. In severe cases, low CD4 + and CD8 + T cell counts are associated with impaired immune functions, and high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios accompanying low lymphocyte subsets have been demonstrated. Recently, high IFN -α/γ ratios with impaired T cell responses, and increased IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1, IP-10, IL-4, IL-10 have been reported in COVID-19 infection. Increased proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in patients with severe COVID-19 may cause the suppression of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and regulatory T cells, causing excessive inflammatory responses and fatal cytokine storm with tissue and organ damage.

METHODS Included were 101,510 participants of the Kailuan Study that joined at baseline (2006). RA cases were confirmed by medical record review. We used logistic regression to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for RA, according to famine exposure status (exposed in utero, or between years 0 and 3, years 3 and 6, or at 6 years or older), in comparison to participants born after 1961 (not exposed to famine). RESULTS During 12 years of follow-up (2006-2018), we identified 187 RA cases. Individuals exposed to famine in utero or during years 0-3, had a higher prevalence of RA, relative to other groups (0.24%-0.35% vs 0.08-0.20%). After adjustment for potential confounders, the OR of RA was 2.95 (95% CI: 1.55, 5.59) for in utero exposed individuals, 4.53 (95% CI: 2.72, 7.54) for those exposed in age 0-3 y, 2.55 (95% CI: 1.43, 4.57) for those exposed in age 3-6 y, and 2.72 (95% CI: 1.70, 4.36) for those exposed after age 6 y versus individuals born after 1961. A similar association was observed for men and women (P-interaction= 0.89). CONCLUSION Individuals exposed to famine in utero or early childhood (0-3 years), were more likely to suffer from RA in adulthood, highlighting the importance of early life as a vulnerable developmental period.","VanEvery, Hannah; Yang, Wen-Hao; Olsen, Nancy; Zhang, Xinyuan; Shu, Rong; Lu, Bing; Wu, Shouling; Cui, Liufu; Gao, Xiang",Arthritis & rheumatology,613,16

MAIN FINDINGS Ophthalmologists have been largely impacted by the COVID-19 sanitary crisis, due to both the ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and to the high contagiousness of the virus. The proximity of ophthalmologists to their patients have pushed eye-care providers to readapt their practices and develop alternatives to face-to-face consultations. However, teleconsultation has some major limitations and drawbacks, especially for ocular surface assessment that relies on high-quality graphic data for adequate diagnosis. Tele-screening, on the other hand, emphasizes on the importance of history-taking and listening to the patient in order to adequately prioritize appointments based on the presumed degree of emergency. CONCLUSION Despite all the enthusiasm, tele-screening as currently performed with the available tools is still not capable of completely replacing a standard ophthalmic examination for the assessment of ocular surface diseases. While waiting for new emerging technologies and future implementation of imaging modalities and artificial intelligence, decision making algorithms can help eye-practitioners remotely screen their patients to assess the optimal time for follow-up appointments.","Labetoulle, Marc; Sahyoun, Marwan; Rousseau, Antoine; Baudouin, Christophe",European journal of ophthalmology,613,8

When asked if it was possible to receive inactivated vaccines while on a biologic, the mass response amidst the control and study group was ""unsure"" (66.9%). CONCLUSION This questionnaire demonstrates that there is a need for supplementary education about vaccines for psoriatic patients on a biologic. Physicians will need to counsel their patients on the use of potential vaccines for SARS-Cov2 while on biologics.","Le, Heather; Vender, Ronald B",Journal of cutaneous medicine and surgery,613,26

More than any other cytokine family, the interleukin (IL)-1 family includes key signaling molecules that trigger and perpetuate periodontal inflammation. Over the years, the IL-1 family expanded to include 11 members of cytokines, some with agonist activity (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-18, IL-33, IL-36α, IL-36β, and IL-36γ), receptor antagonists (IL-1Ra, IL-36Ra), and 2 anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-37, IL-38). The IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) has emerged as a pivotal player in the defense against periodontitis. IL-33 primarily induces the production of Th2-associated cytokines but acts as an ""alarmin"" via stimulation of mast cells. The IL-36 subclass of cytokines may be important in regulating mucosal inflammation and homeostasis. IL-37 suppresses innate and acquired immune responses. IL-38 is the most recent member of the IL-1 superfamily and has anti-inflammatory properties similar to those of IL-37 but through different receptors. However, limited evidence exists regarding the role of IL-37 and IL-38 in periodontitis. Despite the development of IL-1 blocking agents, therapeutic blockade of select IL-1 family members for periodontitis has only been partially investigated in preclinical and clinical research, while the development of IL-37 and IL-38 as novel anti-inflammatory drugs has not been considered adequately. Here, we review the key properties of the IL-1 family members and provide insights into targeting or promoting select cytokines as new therapeutic agents.","Papathanasiou, E; Conti, P; Carinci, F; Lauritano, D; Theoharides, T C",Journal of dental research,613,1

AIM To assess whether food antigens penetrate the oesophageal mucosa in patients with EoE. METHODS Anti-gliadin staining was performed in three groups: active EoE, inactive EoE and EoE patients on a low or gluten free diet. To appraise the specificity of our results, we also performed gliadin staining on six patients without oesophageal disease who were consuming gluten. The groups with EoE on gluten also underwent endoscopic infusion with gluten containing soy sauce and repeat biopsies during the endoscopy. We measured eosinophil density, dilated intercellular spaces (on a 0-4+ scale) and gliadin in oesophageal mucosa by immunofluorescence. RESULTS Patients with active EoE had significantly greater epithelial density of anti-gliadin staining when compared to inactive EoE (P < 0.0065) and gluten-free patients (P < 0.0008) at baseline and after soy infusion. Gliadin was not detected in non-EoE control patients. The distribution of gliadin was both cytoplasmic and nuclear. There was good correlation of dilated intercellular spaces grade and total gliadin staining intensity (r = 0.577, P = 0.0077). Acute oesophageal perfusion of a commercial gliadin-rich soy sauce did not lead to an increase in gliadin staining in active or inactive EoE. CONCLUSION These findings suggest, although do not prove, that antigen penetration in active eosinophilic oesophagitis might be facilitated by impairment of epithelial integrity.","Marietta, E V; Geno, D M; Smyrk, T C; Becker, A; Alexander, J A; Camilleri, M; Murray, J A; Katzka, D A",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,613,15

It utilizes the concept of inline viewing and a single incision that accommodates all of the working instruments. Here, we describe a single surgeon's initial experiences of using this technique in a tertiary hospital. METHODS Between January and September 2010, 21 patients underwent SILC for symptomatic cholelithiasis. The umbilicus was the point of access into abdomen for all patients using a 2.0-2.5-cm incision. The surgeries were performed using the Covidien SILS port with a 30° angled scope and two 5-mm conventional laparoscopic instruments. RESULTS Nineteen patients successfully underwent surgery (8 males and 11 females; mean age: 43 years). The mean body mass index was 25.9 kg/m(2) (range: 19.0-38.2 kg/m(2)). The mean operative time was 89 minutes (range: 55-135 minutes). Minimal blood loss was noted in each patient. The mean length of the postoperative stay was 1.1 days (range: 1-3 days). No complications or mortalities were associated with the technique. The visual analogue score for pain at the 1-day and 6-week follow-up examinations was 2 (range: 1-7) and 0.6 (range: 0-3), respectively. At 6 weeks, the mean satisfaction score for the resultant scar was 8.8 (range: 4-10) and the mean overall satisfaction score was 9.2 (range: 7-10). The mean time until returning to work or normal activities was 8.8 days (range: 1-21 days). CONCLUSION SILC is feasible and demonstrates a good clinical outcome.","Siow, Sze Li; Khor, Tze Wei; Chea, Chan Hooi; Nik Azim, Nik Abdullah",Asian journal of surgery,613,17

In this study, various alternative (mostly common household) materials, which have not traditionally been used in respiratory protective devices, were tested for particle filtration performance and breathability. Most of these materials were found of some-but rather limited-utility in facemasks. At a breathing flow rate of 30 L min-1, 17 out of 19 tested materials demonstrated collection efficiency below 50%; at 85 L min-1, only one material featured particle collection efficiency above 50%. Pressure drop values were mostly below 4 mm w.g. (observed in 89% of cases for the two flow rates), which provides comfortable breathing. Only for one fabric material (silk) tested at 85 L min-1 did the pressure drop reach 11 mm w.g. Based on these results, a three-layer facemask prototype was designed and fabricated comprised of the best performing materials. Additional tests were conducted to examine possible particle detachment/shedding from the materials used in the newly developed facemask, but no such phenomenon was observed. The prototype was evaluated on 10 human subjects using the standard OSHA-approved quantitative fit testing protocol. The mask protection level, determined as an adopted fit factor, was found to lie between that of the two commercial surgical/medical masks tested for comparison. A 10-cycle washing of the mask prototype lowered its collection efficiency across the particle size range; however, washing did not substantially affect mask breathability. The study revealed that although homemade masks offer a certain level of protection to a wearer, one should not expect them to provide the same respiratory protection as high-end commercial surgical/medical masks or-by any means-NIOSH-certified N95 filtering facepieces.","Reutman, Susan R; Reponen, Tiina; Yermakov, Michel; A Grinshpun, Sergey",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,613,0

The authors reviewed their experience and described these refinements. METHODS The charts of 371 free tissue transfer cases (1989 to 2010) performed by the senior author (J.W.S.) were reviewed. Free tissue transfer of a circumflex scapular variant flap or superficial inferior epigastric was performed to treat deformities arising from hemifacial atrophy (n = 126), hemifacial microsomia (n = 89), radiation therapy (n = 40), bilateral malformations including lupus and polymyositis (n = 50), other congenital anomalies (n = 25), facial palsy (n = 17), and burns and trauma (n = 24). RESULTS Revision surgery planning began at initial flap operation where the flap was stretched maximally and interdigitated with recipient tissue. More tissue was required in the malar region. Revision refinement was indicated in all cases (after 6 months). Flap revision involved liposuction, debulking, reelevation, and release of tethering, followed by tissue rearrangement by means of advancement, rotation, transposition, and/or turnover flaps of subcutaneous tissues from the previous free flap. The jawline frequently required more debulking. Periorbital reconstruction was combined with lower lid support with or without canthal repositioning. Conventional face-lift techniques with the flap as superficial musculoaponeurotic system augmented the result. Autologous fat injection to the alar rim, medial canthus, upper eyelid, and lip was a useful adjunct. Severe lip deficiencies were addressed with local flaps. CONCLUSION The keys to improving results were continual critical reassessment, open-mindedness to new approaches, and maintaining high expectations.

As it is often difficult to accurately date the acquisition of magnetic information recorded in archaeological materials, large age uncertainties and discrepancies are common in archaeomagnetic datasets, limiting the ability to use these data for geomagnetic modeling and archaeomagnetic dating. Here we present an accurately dated reconstruction of the intensity and direction of the field in Jerusalem in August, 586 BCE, the date of the city's destruction by fire by the Babylonian army, which marks the end of the Iron Age in the Levant. We analyzed 54 floor segments, of unprecedented construction quality, unearthed within a large monumental structure that had served as an elite or public building and collapsed during the conflagration. From the reconstructed paleomagnetic directions, we conclude that the tilted floor segments had originally been part of the floor of the second story of the building and cooled after they had collapsed. This firmly connects the time of the magnetic acquisition to the date of the destruction. The relatively high field intensity, corresponding to virtual axial dipole moment (VADM) of 148.9 ± 3.9 ZAm2, accompanied by a geocentric axial dipole (GAD) inclination and a positive declination of 8.3°, suggests instability of the field during the 6th century BCE and redefines the duration of the Levantine Iron Age Anomaly. The narrow dating of the geomagnetic reconstruction enabled us to constrain the age of other Iron Age finds and resolve a long archaeological and historical discussion regarding the role and dating of royal Judean stamped jar handles. This demonstrates how archaeomagnetic data derived from historically-dated destructions can serve as an anchor for archaeomagnetic dating and its particular potency for periods in which radiocarbon is not adequate for high resolution dating.","Vaknin, Yoav; Shaar, Ron; Gadot, Yuval; Shalev, Yiftah; Lipschits, Oded; Ben-Yosef, Erez",PloS one,613,29

Epitope mapping is essential to understand how an antibody works and to protect intellectual property. Given the millions of antibodies for which epitope information is lacking, there is a need for high-throughput epitope mapping. To address this, we developed a strategy, Antibody binding epitope Mapping (AbMap), by combining a phage displayed peptide library with next generation sequencing. Using AbMap, profiles of the peptides bound by 202 antibodies were determined in a single test, and linear epitopes were identified for >50% of the antibodies. Using spike protein (S1 and S2)-enriched antibodies from the convalescent serum of one COVID-19 patient as the input, both linear and potentially conformational epitopes of spike protein specific antibodies were identified. We defined peptide-binding profile of an antibody as the Binding Capacity (BiC). Conceptually, the BiC could serve as a systematic and functional descriptor of any antibody. Requiring at least one order of magnitude less time and money to map linear epitopes than traditional technologies, AbMap allows for high-throughput epitope mapping and creates many possibilities.","Qi, Huan; Ma, Mingliang; Hu, Chuansheng; Xu, Zhao-Wei; Wu, Fan-Lin; Wang, Nan; Lai, Dan-Yun; Li, Yang; Zhang, Hainan; Jiang, He-Wei; Meng, Qing-Feng; Guo, Shujuan; Kang, Yani; Zhao, Xiaodong; Li, Hua; Tao, Sheng-Ce",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,613,22

She had been in close contact with an undiagnosed patient infected with COVID-19 and then developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite a lack of known risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 infection, the patient's dyspnea worsened and her respiratory condition deteriorated, as indicated by the need for 7 L/min oxygen supply by mask to maintain her oxygen saturation at >90%.

They are also a sentinel surveillance population whose clinical status reflects the effectiveness of the hospital's infection prevention measures in the pandemic. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in Singapore General Hospital (SGH), a 1,822-bed tertiary hospital. Participants were all HCWs working in SGH during the study period. HCW protection measures included clinical workflows and personal protective equipment developed and adapted to minimise the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. HCW monitoring comprised staff contact logs in high-risk locations, twice-daily temperature monitoring, assessment of HCWs with acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) in the staff clinic and, in the event of an exposure, extensive contact tracing, detailed risk assessment and risk-based interventions. HCW surveillance utilised monitoring data and ARI presentations and outcomes. RESULTS In the ten-week period between 6 January 2020 and 16 March 2020, 333 (17.1%) of 1,946 HCWs at risk of occupational COVID-19 presented with ARI. 32 (9.6%) screened negative for SARS-CoV-2 from throat swabs. Five other HCWs developed COVID-19 attributed to non-clinical exposures. From the nine COVID-19 exposure episodes investigated, 189 HCW contacts were identified, of whom 68 (36.2%) were placed on quarantine and remained well. CONCLUSION Early in an emerging infectious disease outbreak, close monitoring of frontline HCWs is essential in ascertaining the effectiveness of infection prevention measures.

Immune-mediated pathology is a key player in this disease; hence, the role of the complement system needs assessment. The complement system and the coagulation cascade share an intricate network, where multiple mediators maintain a balance between both pathways. Coagulopathy in COVID-19, showing mixed features of complement-mediated and consumption coagulopathy, creates a dilemma in diagnosis and management. AREAS COVERED Pathophysiology of coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients, with a particular focus on D-dimer and its role in predicting the severity of COVID-19 has been discussed. A comprehensive search of the medical literature on PubMed was done till May 30th, 2020 with the keywords 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Coronavirus', 'Coagulopathy', and 'D-dimer'. Twenty-two studies were taken for weighted pooled analysis of D-dimer. EXPERT OPINION A tailored anticoagulant regimen, including intensification of standard prophylactic regimens with low-molecular-weight heparin is advisable for COVID-19 patients. Atypical manifestations and varying D-dimer levels seen in different populations bring forth the futility of uniform recommendations for anticoagulant therapy. Further, direct thrombin inhibitors and platelet inhibitors in a patient-specific manner should also be considered.","Tomo, Sojit; Kumar, Kiran Pvsn; Roy, Dipayan; Sankanagoudar, Shrimanjunath; Purohit, Purvi; Yadav, Dharamveer; Banerjee, Mithu; Sharma, Praveen; Misra, Sanjeev",Expert review of hematology,613,1

We extend this work by examining whether SES trajectories and daily discrimination are independently associated with markers of inflammation. METHOD Data were from 215 Black adults (188 recruited from Milwaukee, WI; 27 recruited from across the continental US) and 985 white adults (7 recruited from Milwaukee, WI; 978 recruited from across the continental US) who completed the baseline interview and biomarker assessment during the second wave of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) Study (ages = 34-84). SES life course trajectories were examined using latent class analysis based on objective (e.g., income and education) and subjective (e.g., social status and financial strain) indicators of SES. The association between life course SES trajectories and daily discrimination with markers of inflammation (IL-6, CRP, fibrinogen) were examined using multiple linear regression analyses, controlling for demographic, psychological, behavioral, and health-related covariates. RESULTS Black and white participants showed different patterns of life course SES trajectories. Among Black participants, the trajectories were Objectively Stable Low (45.16%), Downwardly Mobile (18.05%), and Upwardly Mobile (36.79%). Compared to the Upwardly Mobile, the Objectively Stable Low class showed elevated IL-6 after controlling for all covariates. Further, daily discrimination, but not SES trajectories, was significantly associated with CRP and fibrinogen after controlling for demographic, psychological, and behavioral covariates. White participants' experiences of life course SES trajectories were characterized as Objectively Stable Low (7.02%), Subjectively Downward (12.48%), Upwardly Mobile (39.99%), and Stable High (40.51%). Among white participants, SES trajectories, but not daily discrimination, were associated with all markers of inflammation (controlling for age and sex). DISCUSSION Consistent with the fundamental cause theory, multiple independent pathways link SES trajectories across the life course and daily discrimination to racial disparities in IL-6, CRP, and fibrinogen.","Surachman, Agus; Jenkins, August I C; Santos, Alexis R; Almeida, David M",Psychoneuroendocrinology,613,33

One immediate concern was what the impact of the comprehensive disease control measures on rates of violence and abuse against children and adolescents would be. OBJECTIVE We aimed to establish rates of child abuse and degree of family conflict during the first COVID-19 lockdown spring 2020. Additionally, we aimed to investigate associations between preexisting and concurrent risk factors and abuse during these unique times. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING A total of 3545 Norwegian 13- to 16-year-olds participated in this study. A total of 1944 of these had provided data 1 year before the lockdown. METHODS We used a web survey format to assess abuse exposure and associated risk factors. The survey was administered in schools during school hours in June 2020, shortly after the reopening of schools after the first lockdown. RESULTS In this sample 8.2% reported psychological abuse during lockdown, 2.4% had experienced physical abuse and 1.4% sexual abuse. For online sexual abuse, the rate was 5.6% during this time period. Adolescents did not report an increase in family conflict. Concurrently perceived family affluence and family risk factors were most strongly associated with physical abuse during lockdown (OR = 11.01(95% CI 5.32-22.84); OR = 5.36 (95% CI 2.69-10.67)), but also other types of child maltreatment. Analyses across assessment points suggested that prior victimization was the most accurate predictor of abuse experiences during lockdown (OR = 3.84 (95% CI 2.85-5.20)). CONCLUSIONS The negative consequences of the COVID-19 preventative measures struck the adolescent population unevenly. The findings underscore the need for targeted measures to mitigate the negative outcomes of health-related crises for adolescents in risk groups such as those with low family affluence and prior abuse experiences.","Augusti, Else-Marie; Sætren, Sjur Skjørshammer; Hafstad, Gertrud S",Child abuse & neglect,613,16

The World Health Organisation has engaged in a programme of scaling-up mental health services, but significant challenges remain. Improving mental health literacy in children and young people, a core part of recent, global health strategies has the potential to address some of these challenges. The study aims to co-develop and feasibility test, a culturally-appropriate toolkit to promote depression and anxiety focused mental health literacy and self-management skills in Indonesia, for children aged 11-15 years. METHODS A mixed methods study comprising four phases. Through a systematic review of existing evidence, phase 1 will review approaches to improve mental health literacy and self-management in South East Asia and critically review current evidence regarding intervention effect. Phase 2 will explore stakeholders' views on depression, anxiety and mental health more broadly and identify priorities for the intervention through the use of semi-structured interviews and/or focus groups with policy makers, clinicians, teachers, adolescent service users, carers and young people aged 11-15. Phase 3 will comprise iterative workshops with local stakeholders to present our findings and co-produce a testable, culturally appropriate toolkit to promote mental health literacy and depression/anxiety focused self-management in 11-15 year olds in Java, Indonesia. Phase 4 comprises feasibility evaluation of our developed intervention via nine in-depth case studies (Jakarta, Bogor and Magelang). We will examine the impact, acceptability and feasibility of our prototype intervention and produce evidence-based guidelines for wider implementation. DISCUSSION Tools to support mental health literacy and self-management are a low cost way in which mental health services in LMICs can attempt to address the burden of anxiety and depression amongst children and young people. However, this is an underexplored area in Indonesia.

Laparoscopic fenestration has become a standard approach for symptomatic hepatic cysts because of the low recurrence rate and minimal postoperative pain. The single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) technique has increasingly gained acceptance and is now applied to a variety of organs and operations. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE Between February 2010 and March 2011, we consecutively performed six cases of single-incision laparoscopic fenestration. A SILS Port was placed through a single intraumbilical skin incision. In addition to standard laparoscopic instruments, a flexible 5-mm laparoscope and an articulating grasper were used. The cyst wall was dissected with a 5-mm bipolar vessel sealer. SILS was successfully performed in all patients, and none required conversion to conventional multiport laparoscopic surgery or open surgery. Intraoperative blood loss was minimal in all cases. Median operative time was 144 min (range, 100-210 min). All patients were discharged uneventfully on 3 day postoperative. Median postoperative follow-up at 15.5 months (range, 8-20 months) did not reveal any complications or recurrence. The umbilical incisions were almost unnoticeable. DISCUSSION Our findings suggest that SILS for fenestration of a giant hepatic cyst is a safe and feasible. It is reproducible technique that is comparable to conventional laparoscopic surgery.","Gocho, Takeshi; Misawa, Takeyuki; Suzuki, Fumitake; Ito, Ryusuke; Shiba, Hiroaki; Futagawa, Yasuro; Wakiyama, Shigeki; Ishida, Yuichi; Yanaga, Katsuhiko",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,613,16

Previous studies have shown that Eap binds with nanomolar affinity to complement component C4b and prevents C4b binding the pro-protease, C2, thereby inhibiting formation of the pro-C3 convertase shared by the classical and lectin pathways (Woehl et al. in J Immunol 193:6161-6171, 2014). The C4b-binding and complement-inhibitory properties of Eap from S. aureus strain Mu50 lie within the two C terminal-most Eap domains (i.e. Eap34) (Woehl et al. J Immunol 193:6161-6171, 2014). Interestingly, Eap34 binds C4b with an apparent KD that is nearly 100-fold tighter than that of either Eap3 or Eap4 alone (Woehl et al. in Protein Sci 26:1595-1608, 2017). This suggests that linking these two domains into a single molecule is a significant determinant of Eap function. To better understand this property at the structural level, we undertook a solution NMR study of the ~ 23 kDa Eap34 protein. In this communication, we report that greater than 98% of the total non-proline backbone residues have been assigned. These data have been deposited in the BMRB database under the accession number 50210.","Pal, Indrani; Mishra, Nitin; Herrera, Alvaro I; Dubey, Abhinav; Arthanari, Haribabu; Geisbrecht, Brian V; Prakash, Om",Biomolecular NMR assignments,613,24

It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its biology is still poorly understood. Currently, there are no vaccines and drugs/or agents that can reduce severity of this new disease. Recent data suggest that patients with age-related comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and dementia are highly susceptible to severe respiratory illness due to coronavirus infection. Recent research also revealed that aged individuals with elevated baseline inflammation cause defects in T and B cells, leading to decreased body's immune response to viral infection. In the current article, we discuss the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on age-related chronic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and Alzheimer's disease. Our article also highlights the interaction between coronavirus and immune cells, and how COVID-19 alters mitochondrial activities in host cells. Based on new and compelling evidence, we propose that mitochondrial fission is inhibited while fusion is promoted, causing mitochondrial elongation and providing a receptive intracellular environment for viral replication in infected cells. Further research is still needed to understand the cross talk between viral replication in mitochondria and disease progression in patients with COVID-19.","Holder, Katherine; Reddy, P Hemachandra","The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry",613,12

The increased knee flexion reported after a continuous walk could be related with muscle fatigue and muscle strength. AIM Does muscle fatigue appears at the end of a walking exercise in children with CP who walk in a crouch gait? METHODS Eleven children with cerebral palsy (GMFCS I to III) who walk in a crouch gait were included. Isometric muscle strength was assessed using a handheld dynamometer. Children were asked to walk for 6 min at comfortable speed. Spatio-temporal, kinematic and electromyographic (EMG) measurements were recorded at the first and the last minute of the 6-minute walking exercise. Muscle fatigue was evaluated using the shift of EMG signals median frequency. RESULTS There was no significant difference in walking speed, cadence, and step length at the end of the 6mwe. Maximal and mean anterior pelvic tilt decreased and knee flexion increased (p < 0.05). Rectus femoris EMG median frequency decreased (p < 0.05). The median frequency in other muscles did not decrease significantly. Greater hip extensor strength was associated with lesser knee flexion at the end of the 6-minute walking exercise (p < 0.05). SIGNIFICANCE The increase in knee flexion at the end of the 6-minute walking exercise can be explained by muscle fatigue found in rectus femoris. Hip extensor strength can limit the deterioration of crouch gait after a 6-minute walking exercise representative of daily activities.","Parent, Audrey; Pouliot-Laforte, Annie; Dal Maso, Fabien; Cherni, Yosra; Marois, Pierre; Ballaz, Laurent",Gait & posture,613,16

By way of critical review, we establish a theoretical framework for the use of TGA under non-isothermal conditions for compositional analysis of waste-derived fuels from municipal solid waste (MSW) (solid recovered fuel (SRF), or refuse-derived fuel (RDF)). Thermal behaviour of SRF/RDF is described as a complex mixture of several components at multiple levels (including an assembly of prevalent waste items, materials, and chemical compounds); and, operating conditions applied to TGA experiments of SRF/RDF are summarised. SRF/RDF mainly contains cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate. Polyvinyl chloride is also used in simulated samples, for its high chlorine content. We discuss the main limitations for TGA-based compositional analysis of SRF/RDF, due to inherently heterogeneous composition of MSW at multiple levels, overlapping degradation areas, and potential interaction effects among waste components and cross-contamination. Optimal generic TGA settings are highlighted (inert atmosphere and low heating rate (⩽10°C), sufficient temperature range for material degradation (⩾750°C), and representative amount of test portion). There is high potential to develop TGA-based composition identification and wider quality assurance and control methods using advanced thermo-analytical techniques (e.g. TGA with evolved gas analysis), coupled with statistical data analytics.","Gerassimidou, Spyridoula; Velis, Costas A; Williams, Paul T; Komilis, Dimitrios","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",613,5

Until recently, testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus focused mainly on healthcare and care home settings. As such, there is far less understanding of community transmission. Protocol: The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) programme is a major programme of home testing for COVID-19 to track progress of the infection in the community. REACT-1 involves cross-sectional surveys of viral detection (virological swab for RT-PCR) tests in repeated samples of 100,000 to 150,000 randomly selected individuals across England. This examines how widely the virus has spread and how many people are currently infected. The age range is 5 years and above. Individuals are sampled from the England NHS patient list. REACT-2 is a series of five sub-studies towards establishing the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in England as an indicator of historical infection. The main study (study 5) uses the same design and sampling approach as REACT-1 using a self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test for IgG antibodies in repeated samples of 100,000 to 200,000 adults aged 18 years and above. To inform study 5, studies 1-4 evaluate performance characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 LFIAs (study 1) and different aspects of feasibility, usability and application of LFIAs for home-based testing in different populations (studies 2-4). Ethics and dissemination: The study has ethical approval. Results are reported using STROBE guidelines and disseminated through reports to public health bodies, presentations at scientific meetings and open access publications. Conclusions: This study provides robust estimates of the prevalence of both virus (RT-PCR, REACT-1) and seroprevalence (antibody, REACT-2) in the general population in England. We also explore acceptability and usability of LFIAs for self-administered testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibody in a home-based setting, not done before at such scale in the general population.","Riley, Steven; Atchison, Christina; Ashby, Deborah; Donnelly, Christl A; Barclay, Wendy; Cooke, Graham S; Ward, Helen; Darzi, Ara; Elliott, Paul",Wellcome open research,613,1

CONCLUSION Anosmia and dysgeusia were noted in more than 1/5th of cases. Absence of rhinitis, low platelet counts and elevated creatinine were associated with anosmia/ dysgeusia in COVID-19 patients.

Will we, as health professionals, be able to provide patients with instruments so that they can fully exercise their autonomy? The guarantee of necessary security solutions, to reduce the risk of contagion in the provision of care, safeguards the principle of non-maleficence. However, the risk of contagion is impossible to completely eliminate, and there is a residual risk associated with the use of physical facilities in healthcare services. But, shouldn't the decision to take that risk be the subject of the patient's free and informed will? The incorporation of telemedicine platforms is ideal for managing several challenges posed by COVID-19, such as the decrease in face-to-face health care assistance. Can the patient really decide how he prefers to be consulted, or are we imposing the consultation model? There have been profound changes in healthcare systems.

Few studies have investigated the durability of these changes. OBJECTIVES The objective of this paper is to investigate changes in sex hormones, sexual functioning, and relevant psychosocial constructs over 4 years in women who underwent bariatric surgery. SETTING The setting is a prospective cohort of 106 women from the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery consortium. METHODS Changes in sex hormones were assessed by blood assay. Sexual functioning, quality of life (QOL), body image, depressive symptoms, and marital adjustment were assessed by psychometric measures. RESULTS Women lost on average (95% confidence interval) 32.3% (30.4%, 34.3%) at postoperative year 3 and 30.6% (28.5%, 32.8%) at postoperative year 4. Compared to baseline, women experienced significant changes at 4 years in all hormones assessed, except estradiol. Women reported significant improvements in sexual functioning (i.e., arousal, desire, and satisfaction) through year 3, but these changes were not maintained through year 4. Changes in relationship quality followed a similar pattern. Improvements in physical aspects of QOL, body image, and depressive symptoms were maintained through 4 years. CONCLUSIONS Improvements in reproductive hormones and physical aspects of QOL, body image, and depressive symptoms were maintained 4 years after bariatric surgery. Improvements in sexual functioning, relationship satisfaction, and mental components of QOL eroded over time.","Sarwer, David B; Wadden, Thomas A; Spitzer, Jacqueline C; Mitchell, James E; Lancaster, Kathy; Courcoulas, Anita; Gourash, William; Rosen, Raymond C; Christian, Nicholas J",Obesity surgery,613,23

AIM We hypothesized that patients with slowly expanding diffusion-weighted imaging lesions would have more penumbral salvage and better clinical outcomes following endovascular reperfusion than patients with rapidly expanding diffusion-weighted imaging lesions. METHODS In the first part of this substudy of DEFUSE 2, growth curves were constructed for patients with >90% reperfusion and <10% reperfusion. Next, the initial growth rate was determined in all patients with a clearly established time of symptom onset, assuming a lesion volume of 0 ml just prior to symptom onset. Patients who achieved reperfusion (>50% reduction in perfusion-weighted imaging after endovascular therapy) were categorized into tertiles according to their initial diffusion-weighted imaging growth rates. For each tertile, penumbral salvage [comparison of final volume to the volume of perfusion-weighted imaging (Tmax > 6 s)/diffusion-weighted imaging mismatch prior to endovascular therapy], favorable clinical response (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improvement of ≥8 points or 0-1 at 30 days), and good functional outcome (90-day modified Rankin score of ≤2) were calculated. A multivariate model assessed whether infarct growth rates were an independent predictor of clinical outcomes. RESULTS Sixty-five patients were eligible for this study; the median initial growth rate was 3·1 ml/h (interquartile range 0·7-10·7). Target mismatch patients (n = 42) had initial growth rates that were significantly slower than the growth rates in malignant profile (n = 9 patients, P < 0·001). In patients who achieved reperfusion (n = 38), slower early diffusion-weighted imaging growth rates were associated with better clinical outcomes (P < 0·05) and a trend toward more penumbral salvage (n = 31, P = 0·103). A multivariate model demonstrated that initial diffusion-weighted imaging growth rate was an independent predictor of achieving a 90-day modified Rankin score of ≤2. CONCLUSIONS The growth rate of early diffusion-weighted imaging lesions in acute stroke patients is highly variable; malignant profile patients have higher growth rates than patients with target mismatch. A slower rate of early diffusion-weighted imaging growth is associated with a greater degree of penumbral salvage and improved clinical outcomes following endovascular reperfusion.","Wheeler, Hayley M; Mlynash, Michael; Inoue, Manabu; Tipirnini, Aaryani; Liggins, John; Bammer, Roland; Lansberg, Maarten G; Kemp, Stephanie; Zaharchuk, Greg; Straka, Matus; Albers, Gregory W",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,613,31

In an effort to slow disease spread and protect valuable healthcare resources, cessation of non-essential surgery including many orthopaedic procedures, has recently become commonplace in areas affected by the novel coronavirus. This crisis has created a unique situation in the care of spine patients as we must balance the urgency of patient evaluation, surgical intervention, and continued training against the risk of disease exposure and resource management.The Spine division of an Orthopaedic Surgery Department at a tertiary care and academic center has taken an active role in enacting protocol changes in anticipation of COVID-19. In the past four weeks, since these changes were enacted, the Spine division has performed ten surgeries compared to an average of 60.4 spine cases performed annually over the same time period between 2015-2019. Furthermore, the number of clinic visits decreased from an average of 417.4 over this time period, to 322 with the percentage of new patient visits decreasing from 28% to 20%. During COVID-19, 318 of the 322 spine clinic visits were performed remotely via telehealth.The response to COVID-19 has been variable among surgical subspecialties and geographic regions. We present the changes that have been made regarding the care of spine patients at a busy academic center. Although these changes have been forced upon us by necessity, we feel that our division and department will emerge in a more responsive, agile and stronger state. As we look to the coming months and beyond, it will be important to continue to adapt to the changing landscape during unprecedented times.","DeKeyser, Graham J; Brodke, Darrel S; Saltzman, Charles L; Lawrence, Brandon D",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,613,1

Since the patient's nutritional status and control of convulsions were good, this was deemed an appropriate time for the surgery. Following careful preoperative evaluation of her airway, we performed oral endotracheal intubation using a video laryngoscope after rapid induction. Since postoperative pain control was important to prevent apneic attacks and convulsions, we used a multimodal analgesic regimen including carefully titrated fentanyl, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and wound infiltration with a local anesthetic. Postoperatively, the patient returned to the intensive care unit under spontaneous ventilation and followed a good course. Patients with Rett syndrome present several symptoms.

The objective of the study was to assess the influence of random leaks occurring either during inspiration or expiration. METHODS Analysis of the volume-targeted pressure support mode in 6 commercial ventilators with single-limb circuits and intentional leak in a bench study (restrictive model). Unintentional leaks were introduced through a mechanical system during inspiration (threshold valve with 2 levels of leaks) or during expiration (active valve). Results of delivered tidal volume (VT) and pressure support were externally recorded. A pre-set VT of 550 mL was programmed, with a wide range of pressure support values. RESULTS All the ventilators showed a deviation of delivered versus programmed VT below 10% in the period without unintentional leaks. In the model with unintentional inspiratory leaks, a progressive drop in delivered VT and pressure support was observed for all ventilators. The reduction in the delivered VT for the highest inspiratory leak ranged between 21 and 40%, corresponding to a decrease in pressure support between 3.09 and 10.15 cm H2O after 5 min. Conversely, in the expiratory model, increases in delivered VT and pressure support were observed, ranging between 16 and 33% and between 2.7 and 6.5 cm H2O, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The introduction of random leaks influences the performance of commercial ventilators with single-limb circuits and intentional leak. The decrease in delivered VT with inspiratory leaks reaches a magnitude that may have clinically important impacts.","Luján, Manel; Sogo, Ana; Grimau, Carles; Pomares, Xavier; Blanch, Lluís; Monsó, Eduard",Respiratory care,613,4

RESULTS Among the 197 patients, 153 patients (77.7%) have positive results of serum SARS coronavirus-specific antibodies test, and 44 patients (22.3%) have negative results. The average age of SARS and non-SARS patients were (40 +/- 12) and (31 +/- 12) years, male/female ratio were 1.0:1.6 and 2.1:1.0, average body temperature were (38.5 degrees C +/- 0.3 degrees C) and (38.1 degrees C +/- 0.4 degrees C), median of fever length were 7.0 d (0.4 approximately 50 d) and 2.3 d (0.3 approximately 37 d) respectively. The occurrence of dyspnea, malaise and gastrointestinal symptom were more often in SARS patient than in non-SARS patients. Some patients have residual symptoms (such as cough, fatigue, dyspnea, abnormality of liver function, hyperglycemia and hyperglyceridemia), and only few patients have lung fibrosis. CONCLUSION Some patients with other respiratory diseases were misdiagnosed as SARS. There were several obvious differences of clinical characteristics between SARS patient and non-SARS patients. Prognosis of most patients were preciously well, and few still had abnormality of lung function. Residual symptoms of SARS and side effects of drugs used to treat SARS should be discriminated.","Tian, Qing; Liu, You-ning; Xie, Li-Xin; Fan, Bao-xing; Xu, Hong-min; Chen, Wei-jun",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,613,1

The approach is based on the design of polythiol peptides able to neutralize the toxicity of As(III) through chelation, and contemporarily to be recognized as substrates of a disease-linked specific protease. Enzyme digestion implies conversion of such polythiol peptides into monothiol fragments with irreversible loss of the ability to chelate the metalloid, thus triggering the release in its free and pharmacologically effective form. The proteases whose activity appears dramatically up-regulated in various pathologies, ranging from cancer to infectious diseases, can be conveniently employed as prodrug activators in the disease microenvironment. The design of the representative peptide shown here has been assisted by molecular modeling in order to fulfill the dual characteristic to be an efficient As(III) chelator and simultaneously a substrate of the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) whose activity results dramatically increased at the surface of cells affected by several pathologies.","Bellacchio, Emanuele; Paggi, Marco G",Journal of cellular physiology,613,16

An understanding of evaporation and dispersion of droplets and droplet nuclei is not only significant for developing effective engineering control methods for infectious diseases but also for exploring the basic transmission mechanisms of the infectious diseases. How far droplets can move is related to how far droplet-borne diseases can transmit. A simple physical model is developed and used here to investigate the evaporation and movement of droplets expelled during respiratory activities; in particular, the well-known Wells evaporation-falling curve of droplets is revisited considering the effect of relative humidity, air speed, and respiratory jets. Our simple model considers the movement of exhaled air, as well as the evaporation and movement of a single droplet. Exhaled air is treated as a steady-state non-isothermal (warm) jet horizontally issuing into stagnant surrounding air. A droplet is assumed to evaporate and move in this non-isothermal jet. Calculations are performed for both pure water droplets and droplets of sodium chloride (physiological saline) solution (0.9% w/v). We calculate the droplet lifetimes and how droplet size changes, as well as how far the droplets travel in different relative humidities. Our results indicate that a droplet's size predominately dictates its evaporation and movement after being expelled. The sizes of the largest droplets that would totally evaporate before falling 2 m away are determined under different conditions. The maximum horizontal distances that droplets can reach during different respiratory activities are also obtained. Our study is useful for developing effective prevention measures for controlling infectious diseases in hospitals and in the community at large. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Our study reveals that for respiratory exhalation flows, the sizes of the largest droplets that would totally evaporate before falling 2 m away are between 60 and 100 microm, and these expelled large droplets are carried more than 6 m away by exhaled air at a velocity of 50 m/s (sneezing), more than 2 m away at a velocity of 10 m/s (coughing) and less than 1 m away at a velocity of 1 m/s (breathing). These findings are useful for developing effective engineering control methods for infectious diseases, and also for exploring the basic transmission mechanisms of the infectious diseases. There is a need to examine the air distribution systems in hospital wards for controlling both airborne and droplet-borne transmitted diseases.","Xie, X; Li, Y; Chwang, A T Y; Ho, P L; Seto, W H",Indoor air,613,9

This, in turn, will reduce the use of proven stroke treatments, which will result in poorer stroke outcomes. We examined local stroke admissions before, during, and after the 2003 outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (these periods being defined in both the Singapore and worldwide contexts), to extrapolate stroke admission patterns in Singapore during the current COVID-19 crisis. MATERIALS AND METHODS National inpatient admission data from the Ministry of Health (MOH), Singapore, and death data from the Registry of Births and Deaths (RBD), Singapore, were analysed. Trends of local stroke admissions and stroke-related mortality pre-SARS, during SARS, and post-SARS periods, both in the Singapore and worldwide contexts, were analysed using time series plot in monthly time units. Differences between periods were presented as percentage change between: (1) SARS and pre-SARS periods, and (2) post-SARS and SARS periods and compared using two-sample t-tests. RESULTS There was a 19% decline in stroke admissions into all local hospitals during the Singapore SARS period (P = 0.002) and a 13% reduction during the worldwide SARS period (P = 0.006). Stroke admissions increased by 18% after the Singapore SARS period was over (P = 0.003) and rose by a further 8% when the worldwide SARS period ended (P = 0.046). Stroke-related mortality remained stable throughout. CONCLUSIONS During the SARS pandemic, there was a reduction in the number of stroke admissions, and this was apparent during both the local SARS and worldwide SARS outbreak periods. We should take appropriate steps through public education to minimise the expected reduced stroke admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic, inferred from the findings during the SARS pandemic.","Riandini, Tessa; Tan, Kelvin Bryan; De Silva, Deidre Anne","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",613,16

A histidine-tagged form of nsp13, which was expressed in insect cells and purified, is reported to unwind efficiently both partial-duplex RNA and DNA of up to several hundred base pairs. Characterization of the nsp13-associated nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) activities revealed that all natural ribonucleotides and nucleotides are substrates of nsp13, with ATP, dATP, and GTP being hydrolyzed most efficiently. Using the NTPase active site, HCoV-229E nsp13 also mediates RNA 5'-triphosphatase activity, which may be involved in the capping of viral RNAs.","Ivanov, Konstantin A; Ziebuhr, John",Journal of virology,613,20

However, for human researchers studying viruses and hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly if our scientific understanding is also limited, which further lowers the information processing efficiency. We present TWIRLS (Topic-wise inference engine of massive biomedical literatures), a method that can deal with various scientific problems, such as liver cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and so forth, which can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, this information can be combined with independent functional data sources to build an inference system via a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. Using TWIRLS, we automatically analyzed more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hr. We found that an important regulatory factor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in host pathological changes on binding to the coronavirus after infection. On triggering functional changes in ACE2/AT2R, the cytokine homeostasis regulation axis becomes imbalanced via the Renin-Angiotensin System and IP-10, leading to a cytokine storm. Through a preliminary analysis of blood indices of COVID-19 patients with a history of hypertension, we found that non-ARB (Angiotensin II receptor blockers) users had more symptoms of severe illness than ARB users. This suggests ARBs could potentially be used to treat acute lung injury caused by coronavirus infection.","Ji, Xiaoyang; Tan, Wenting; Zhang, Chunming; Zhai, Yubo; Hsueh, Yiching; Zhang, Zhonghai; Zhang, Chunli; Lu, Yanqiu; Duan, Bo; Tan, Guangming; Na, Renhua; Deng, Guohong; Niu, Gang",Drug dev. res,613,1

Digital research tools, such as online platforms, mobile apps, and text messaging, have the potential to address barriers to research by facilitating remote participation. However, there has been limited research on leveraging these technologies to engage people with psychosis and their families in research. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the uptake of digital tools to engage patients with provisional psychosis and their families in research and their preferences for different research administration methods. METHODS: This study used Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)-a secure web-based platform with built-in tools for data collection and storage-to send web-based consent forms and surveys on service engagement via text message or email to patients and families referred to early psychosis intervention services; potential participants were also approached or reminded about the study in person. We calculated completion rates and timing using remote and in-person methods and compensation preferences. RESULTS: A total of 447 patients with provisional psychosis and 187 of their family members agreed to receive the web-based consent form, and approximately half of the patients (216/447, 48.3%) and family members (109/187, 58.3%) consented to participate in the survey. Most patients (182/229, 79.5%) and family members (75/116, 64.7%) who completed the consent form did so remotely, with more family members (41/116, 35.3%) than patients (47/229, 20.5%) completing it in person. Of those who consented, 77.3% (167/216) of patients and 72.5% (79/109) of family members completed the survey, and most did the survey remotely. Almost all patients (418/462, 90.5%) and family members (174/190, 91.6%) requested to receive the consent form and survey by email, and only 4.1% (19/462) and 3.2% (6/190), respectively, preferred text message. Just over half of the patients (91/167, 54.5%) and family members (42/79, 53.2%) preferred to receive electronic gift cards from a coffee shop as study compensation. Most surveys were completed on weekdays between 12 PM and 6 PM. CONCLUSIONS: When offered the choice, most participants with psychosis and their families chose remote administration methods, suggesting that digital tools may enhance research recruitment and participation in this population, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 global pandemic.","Polillo, Alexia; Voineskos, Aristotle N; Foussias, George; Kidd, Sean A; Sav, Andreea; Hawley, Steve; Soklaridis, Sophie; Stergiopoulos, Vicky; Kozloff, Nicole",JMIR Ment Health,613,1

There is growing recognition that digital technologies have the potential to improve the well-being of frontline workers. However, there has been limited development of wellness interventions using mobile health (mHealth) technology. More importantly, little research has been conducted on how frontline workers perceive mHealth-based support to promote their well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore frontline workers' experience of conventional psychological wellness programs and their perceptions of the usefulness of mHealth apps and features for promoting well-being. It also sought to identify factors that could potentially influence uptake and retention of an mHealth-based wellness program. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews using purposive sampling with frontline workers involved in the COVID-19 response. Various visual materials, collated from existing mHealth app features, were presented to facilitate discussion. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis based on grounded theory was undertaken. Themes were subsequently mapped to key nudge strategies-those commonly used for mHealth development-to assess participants' preferences for particular features and their reasoning. RESULTS: A total of 42 frontline workers participated in 12 one-on-one interviews or focus group discussions. Frontline workers generally had a limited ability to identify their own psychological problems and liked the reminders functionality of the app to track their mood over time. A personalized goal-setting feature (ie, tailoring) and in-app resources were generally valued, while frequent coaching and messages (ie, framing) were seen as a distraction. The majority of participants desired a built-in chat function with a counselor (ie, guidance) for reasons of accessibility and protection of privacy. Very few participants appreciated a gamification function. Frontline workers commonly reported the need for ongoing social support and desired access to an in-app peer support community (ie, social influence). There were, however, concerns regarding potential risks from virtual peer interactions. Intrinsic motivational factors, mHealth app technicality, and tangible rewards were identified as critical for uptake and retention. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the potential of mHealth apps with relevant features to be used as wellness tools by frontline health care workers. Future work should focus on developing a nonintrusive and personalized mHealth app with in-app counseling, peer support to improve well-being, and tangible and extrinsic rewards to foster continued use.","Yoon, Sungwon; Goh, Hendra; Nadarajan, Gayathri Devi; Sung, Sharon; Teo, Irene; Lee, Jungup; Ong, Marcus E H; Graves, Nicholas; Teo, Tess Lin",J Med Internet Res,613,26

METHODS: Using data from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey conducted in October 2020 among 855 adults (&#8805;18 years) in Greece, we estimated support rates for mandatory vaccination and respondents' intention to get vaccinated for COVID-19 as well as associations thereof with individual sociodemographic, clinical and contextual characteristics. RESULTS: About 74% of respondents supported mandatory vaccination and 62% intended to get vaccinated for COVID-19. The most prevalent reasons against COVID-19 vaccination were safety concerns related to the duration of clinical trials and potential side effects. Individuals who reported increased trust in healthcare authorities' recommendations, who revealed that their trust in the State increased due to the way the COVID-19 pandemic was handled, who used preventive services more often, and those with higher income were more likely to both support mandatory vaccination and to indicate intention to get vaccinated for COVID-19. Participants with worse or better self-reported health status (compared to average), younger adults, and females were less likely to intend to get vaccinated for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The survey revealed that the majority of the Greek citizens favour mandatory vaccination overall and intend to get vaccinated for COVID-19, driven mostly by utilization of preventive services and trust in healthcare authorities. However, intention to get vaccinated for COVID-19 was lower relative to mandatory vaccination support. This suggests a need to intensify evidence-based yet simplified messaging by esteemed healthcare providers to inform the public on the risks and benefits of vaccines.","Giannouchos, Theodoros V; Steletou, Evaggelia; Saridi, Maria; Souliotis, Kyriakos",J. eval. clin. pract.

In this paper, we study the impact of Covid-19 on smartphone usage. We gather smartphone usage records from a global data collection platform called Carat, including the usage of mobile users in North America from November 2019 to April 2020. We then conduct the first study on the differences in smartphone usage across the outbreak of Covid-19. We discover that Covid-19 leads to a decrease in users&#x2019;smartphone engagement and network switches, but an increase in WiFi usage. Also, its outbreak causes new typical diurnal patterns of both memory usage and WiFi usage. Additionally, we investigate the correlations between smartphone usage and daily confirmed cases of Covid-19. The results reveal that memory usage, WiFi usage, and network switches of smartphones have significant correlations, whose absolute values of Pearson coefficients are greater than 0.8. Moreover, smartphone usage behavior has the strongest correlation with the Covid-19 cases occurring after it, which exhibits the potential of inferring outbreak status. By conducting extensive experiments, we demonstrate that for the inference of outbreak stages, both Macro-F1 and Micro-F1 can achieve over 0.8. Our findings explore the values of smartphone usage data for fighting against the epidemic.

Terminologies in each subdiscipline further form a directed acyclic graph, opening up new avenues for developing graph-aware text generation models. We then proposed a novel graph-aware definition generation model Graphex that integrates transformer with graph neural network. Our model outperforms existing text generation models by exploiting the graph structure of terminologies. We further demonstrated how Graphine can be used to evaluate pretrained language models, compare graph representation learning methods and predict sentence granularity.

Risk factors for severe COVID-19 include older age, ethnicity, sex, comorbidities, and living conditions. Although asthmatics and those with allergies are susceptible to more severe outcomes to viral infections, interestingly, asthma has not been reported to be a major comorbidity of COVID-19. However, there are some conflicting reports on the impact of asthma on COVID-19. The underlying immunological and molecular mechanisms may explain at least in part these observations. Furthermore, environmental factors like air pollution that have detrimental effects on asthma and respiratory illnesses also have an impact on COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for the attachment and entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells that is upregulated by Th1-mediated responses. In asthmatics, ACE2 gene expression is generally reduced and recent studies have shown a negative correlation between the levels of Th2 cytokines including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in airway epithelial cells and other type 2 biomarkers with ACE2 expression. This may explain in part the potential protective role of asthma on COVID-19. Here, we review the relation of respiratory viral illnesses and asthma, the immune-molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the impact of asthma on COVID-19 and that of SARS-CoV-2 on asthma and allergic rhinitis, and the impact of environmental factors like air pollution on COVID-19. SUMMARY: Expression of ACE2 in airway epithelial cells in SARS-COV-2 is influenced by inflammatory profile. Respiratory allergic diseases like asthma appear to have a protective effect against SARS-COV-2 infection. However, the clinical association between asthma and SARS-COV-2 is not fully established and the underlying immune-molecular mechanisms may explain these observations.","Wakabayashi, Mako; Pawankar, Ruby; Narazaki, Hidehiko; Ueda, Takahiro; Itabashi, Toshikazu",Curr. opin. allergy clin. immunol,613,1

Findings of the OBECHO project have formed the unprecedentedly inclusive evidence for policy-making and the establishment of the future research agenda regarding the obesogenic environment. Furthermore, the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has made this evidence become an important benchmark record of how youths have interacted with the obesogenic environment in the pre-COVID-19 era. The implementation of lockdown measures worldwide for curbing COVID-19 transmission has been affecting not mere youth's lifestyle behaviours and weight status but, more fundamentally, obesogenic environments and hence youth-environment interaction patterns. However, COVID-19, although causing unfavoured changes, will speed up the transformation of the research landscape from traditional to modern modes for more reliable evidence.

Based on the information available so far, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater has raised interest in using it as an early warning method, to detect the resurgence of infections and to report the risk associated with contracting SARS-CoV-2 in contact with untreated water or inadequately treated wastewater is discharged. The wastewater-based epidemiological approach can be used as an early indicator of infection within a specific population. On the other hand, it is necessary to collect information from the managers of drinking water supply companies and professionals who are related to water quality, to know SARS-CoV-2 data and information, and its influence on drinking water quality. The basic purpose of this review article is to try to provide a valuable and quick reference guide to COVID-19. Important topics were discussed, such as detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in various parts of the world; wastewater screening to monitor COVID-19; persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in aquatic systems; the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in drinking water; clean water as a mechanism to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic; chlorine as a disinfectant to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 and damage to ecosystems by the use of chlorine. Currently does not exist extensive literature on the effectiveness of water and wastewater treatment processes that ensure the correct elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Excessive use of disinfectants such as chlorine is causing effects on the environment. This document highlights the need for further research to establish the behavior of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in aquatic systems. This study presents an early overview of the observed and potential impacts of COVID-19 on the environment.","García-Ávila, Fernando; Valdiviezo-Gonzales, Lorgio; Cadme-Galabay, Manuel; Gutiérrez-Ortega, Horacio; Altamirano-Cárdenas, Luis; Arévalo, César Zhindón-; Flores del Pino, Lisveth",,613,10

Although the Chinese Government has already carried out a series of emergency education and training programmes to improve public health staff's capability of emergency preparedness, it remains unclear if these training programmes are effective and feasible. The purpose of this research was to evaluate an emergency preparedness training programme and to develop a participatory training approach for emergency response. METHODS: Seventy-six public health staff completed the emergency preparedness training programme. The effectiveness of the training was evaluated by questionnaire before training, immediately after training and 12 months after training (follow-up). Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted throughout the training period. RESULTS: The emergency preparedness training improved the knowledge levels and increased attitudinal and behavioural intention scores for emergency preparedness (P<0.01). The results at follow-up showed that the knowledge levels and attitudinal/behavioural intention scores of participants decreased slightly (P>0.05) compared with levels immediately after training (P<0.01). However, there was a significant increase compared with before training (P<0.01). Moreover, more than 80% of participants reported that the training process and resources were scientific and feasible. CONCLUSIONS: The emergency preparedness training programme met its aims and objectives satisfactorily, and resulted in positive shifts in knowledge and attitudinal/behavioural intentions for public health staff. This suggests that this emergency training strategy was effective and feasible in improving the capability of emergency preparedness.","Wang, Chongjian; Wei, Sheng; Xiang, Hao; Xu, Yihua; Han, Shenghong; Mkangara, Ommari Baaliy; Nie, Shaofa",Public Health,613,10

Of 30 farms (total flock size 104,200; range 3000–6000), prevalence of antibiotic use was 90% (95% CI: 73–98%). Six (22%) farms used antibiotics as prophylaxis, while 21 (78%) used it for therapeutics. Seven antibiotics from six classes (including quinolones, macrolides, and polymyxins) were used. The most commonly used antibiotics were tylosin (47%), colistin (47%), and dual therapies with neomycin and doxycycline (33%). A total of 50,000 grams of antibiotics (total weight including active and inactive ingredients) were used (0.5 grams/chicken/45 days of flock life) with eight (26%) farms using more than two antibiotics. No farms had records on clinical indications for prophylaxis or treatment. No post-mortem records of sick birds were available. Prevalence of antibiotic use in broiler farms of Kathmandu valley is high and includes “highest priority critically important antibiotics” for human use, with direct implications on public health.","Koirala, Ananta; Bhandari, Priyanka; Shewade, Hemant Deepak; Tao, Wenjing; Thapa, Badri; Terry, Robert; Zachariah, Rony; Karki, Surendra",Trop Med Infect Dis,613,1
