49886,Factorization in Call-by-Name and Call-by-Value Calculi via Linear Logic,2021-03-23,"Colorimetric detection is one of the main strategies used in biosensors due to the inexpensive, rapid, and easy readout. Among the main types of colorimetric biosensors are paper-based, lab-on-chip, lab-on-compact disk, and other alternative devices. In this chapter, some of the recent examples of BioMEMS are provided including DNA-detecting sensors based on acpcPNA-induces NP aggregation, neuropeptide Y-detecting ELISA platforms, streptococcus pneumonia and E. coli-detecting biosensors incorporating nucleus acid extraction, smartphone-based devices for biomarkers detection in sweat and saliva, and glass nanofiber-based biosensors for the detection of cholinesterase inhibitors. This chapter provides a thorough review of the latest advancements in of bio-microelectromechanical systems (BioMEMS) that operate based on the principle of colorimetric detection. A detailed comparison between the fabrication and operation of these devices along with the advantages and disadvantages of each technique are also included in this chapter.","Espinosa-Hernandez, Michelle Alejandra; Reveles-Huizar, Sofia; Hosseini, Samira",BioMEMS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981492/,818
