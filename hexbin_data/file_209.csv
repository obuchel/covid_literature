562,Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure due to H1N1 influenza,2011,We present a case of severe H1N1 influenza with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation benefited from noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The NIPPV may be of great use in treating patients with H1N1-related acute respiratory distress syndrome in a resource poor setting or when invasive ventilator is unavailable.,"Mohapatra, Prasanta R.; Dutt, Naveen; Khanduri, Sushant; Mishra, Baijayantimala; Janmeja, Ashok K.",Lung India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3099510/,209
3238,Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is associated with adverse clinical outcomes in critically ill patients receiving veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,2018-04-06,"To identify the incidence, risk factors and impact on long-term survival of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) and Aspergillus colonisation in patients receiving vv-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). A retrospective evaluation was performed of patients receiving vv-ECMO at a tertiary hospital in Manchester (UK) between January 2012 and December 2016. Data collected included epidemiological data, microbiological cultures, radiographic findings and outcomes. Cases were classified as proven IPA, putative IPA or Aspergillus colonisation according to a validated clinical algorithm. One hundred thirty-four patients were supported with vv-ECMO, median age of 45.5 years (range 16.4–73.4). Ten (7%) patients had putative IPA and nine (7%) had Aspergillus colonisation. Half of the patients with putative IPA lacked classical host risk factors for IPA. The median number of days on ECMO prior to Aspergillus isolation was 5 days. Immunosuppression and influenza A infection were significantly associated with developing IPA in a logistic regression model. Cox regression model demonstrates a three times greater hazard of death associated with IPA. Overall 6-month mortality rate was 38%. Patients with putative IPA and colonised patients had a 6-month mortality rate of 80 and 11%, respectively. Immunosuppression and influenza A infection are independent risk factors for IPA. IPA, but not Aspergillus colonisation, is associated with high long-term mortality in patients supported with vv-ECMO.","Rodriguez-Goncer, I.; Thomas, S.; Foden, P.; Richardson, M.

Despite rodents being the most widely used research model worldwide, in recent decades, the use of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) model has exponentially been adopted among the scientific community. This is because such a small tropical freshwater teleost fish has crucial genetic, anatomical and physiological homology with mammals. Therefore, zebrafish constitutes an excellent experimental model for behavioral, genetic and toxicological studies which unravels the mechanism of various human diseases. Furthermore, it serves well to test new therapeutic agents, such as the safety of new vaccines. The aim of this review was to provide a systematic literature review on the most recent studies carried out on the topic. It presents numerous advantages of this type of animal model in tests of efficacy and safety of both animal and human vaccines, thus highlighting gains in time and cost reduction of research and analyzes.","Bailone, Ricardo Lacava; Fukushima, Hirla Costa Silva; Ventura Fernandes, Bianca Helena; De Aguiar, Luís Kluwe; Corrêa, Tatiana; Janke, Helena; Grejo Setti, Princia; Roça, Roberto De Oliveira; Borra, Ricardo Carneiro",Lab Anim Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7203993/,209

Towards this end, this research experimentally manipulated perceptions of group-level competition between Black and White individuals in the U.S. and tested for effects on negative psychological outcomes. In Study 1 (N = 899), participants assigned to the high interracial competition condition (HRC) reported perceiving more discrimination, behavioral avoidance, intergroup anxiety, and interracial mistrust relative to low interracial competition (LRC) participants. Study 2 –a preregistered replication and extension—specifically recruited similar numbers of only Black and White participants (N = 1,823). Consistent with Study 1, Black and White participants in the HRC condition reported more discrimination, avoidance, anxiety, and mistrust. Main effects for race also emerged: Black participants perceived more interracial competition and negative outcomes. Racial income inequality moderated effects; competition effects were stronger in areas with higher levels of inequality. Implications for theory development are discussed.","Gordils, Jonathan; Elliot, Andrew J.; Jamieson, Jeremy P.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7845962/,209

Reducing glycemic fluctuations is beneficial. We previously reported that a portable motorized passive simulated jogging device, (JD) reduces 24 h glycemic indices in type 2 and non-diabetic subjects. This study evaluates effectiveness and feasibility of JD in blunting large glycemic fluctuation induced by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The study was performed in 10 adult participants mean age 41.3 ± 13.5 year using interstitial glucose monitor (IG). Each participant fasted for 8 h. followed by an OGTT (Pre-JD), thereafter JD was used for 90 min per day for 7 days, without change to diet or activities of daily living. A repeat OGTT (Post-JD) was performed after completion. The integrated area under the curve (iAUC(2h–4h)) was computed for the OGTT Pre-JD and Post-JD. Seven days of JD blunted the glucose fluctuation produced by OGTT. JD decreased AUC(2h) by 17 ± 4.7% and iAUC(4h) by 15 ± 5.9% (p < 0.03). In healthy mostly obese participants 7 days of JD blunts the hyperglycemic response produced by an OGTT. JD may be an adjunct to current glycemic management, it can be applied in different postures for those who cannot (due to physical or cognitive limitations) or will not exercise.

16848,Bioinformatic analysis identifies potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of septic-shock-associated acute kidney injury,2021-04-16,"PURPOSE: To investigate the association of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors and acute kidney injury in comparison to other classes of drugs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 4966 diabetes mellitus patients were investigated for developing Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) who were under prescription with the following class of drugs viz. SGLT2 Inhibitors, Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DDP4) inhibitors, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), first-line drugs and anti-biotics. The primary outcome was based on the hospital encounter and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) threshold values were used to assess the serum creatinine concentration. The secondary outcome was assessed based on the concentration level of serum creatinine after 90 days of hospital admission and evaluation of the KDIGO threshold values. RESULTS: The study observed that the risk of causing AKI for SGLT2 inhibitors was 5.59% which was comparatively low compared to other class of the investigated drugs (DPP4 inhibitors = 6.47%, antibiotics = 6.30%, first-line drugs = 6.82% and NSAIDs = 10.65%). The multivariate analysis observed that ibuprofen, celecoxib, indomethacin, insulin, cephalexin, and alogliptin were mostly associated with an increased rate of AKI. SGLT2 inhibitors have the lowest risk for developing AKI compared to other drugs and control. CONCLUSION: AKI incidence is relatively low after initiation of SLGT2 inhibitors and concludes that regulatory warnings from certain health agencies about its risk for AKI on prescription are unwarranted.","Shen, Lianglan; Yang, Hongli; Fang, Xingxing; Huang, Huaxing; Yao, Wubin; Chen, Dongmei; Shen, Yan",Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8053501/,209
22153,Letter to editor regarding “Clinical Presentation and Outcomes of Pregnant Women With Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis”,2021-08-06,"BACKGROUND: Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis (anti-NMDARE) is a multi-stage autoimmune-mediated disease associated with a multitude of neuropsychiatric and dysautonomic features. Orofacial dyskinesias are frequently associated with this condition and manifest as abnormal movements of the orofacial musculature. These involuntary movements may result in significant trauma to the oral and maxillofacial complex including the avulsion of the dentition and orofacial lacerations. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the course of two female patients with anti-NMDARE in whom significant involuntary self-inflicted maxillofacial trauma was suffered despite the use of complex parenteral sedation regimens. The application of traditional maxillomandibular wiring techniques and pharmacologic strategies, including botulinum toxin, to immobilize the mandible were initially unsuccessful. These difficulties led to the fabrication and wire-based fixation of a patient-specific acrylic oral appliance that maintained the mandible in a depressed position and mitigated all lateral and protrusive movements. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These cases illustrate the first known successful use of an appliance-based therapy for managing orofacial dyskinesias in the anti-NMDARE patient population through an adaptation of traditional maxillomandibular fixation techniques. This approach eliminated further orofacial trauma and afforded physicians with safer means to manage and assess patients afflicted with this condition during their protracted intensive care unit admissions.","Chadwick, Jeffrey W.; Brooks, Patricia J.; Singh, Jeffrey M.; Lam, David K.",BMC Oral Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8502506/,209

29406,Do Nonventilatory Strategies for Acute Lung Injury and ARDS Work?,2010-09-02,"This chapter focuses on the naturally occurring viral diseases of rabbits. Poxviruses cause several important diseases in domestic and wild mammals and birds. Infection with poxviruses usually results in relatively mild disease involving the skin of the infected animals, however, generalized and often fatal disease may also occur, for example, in myxomatosis in rabbits. Close antigenic relationships exist among many poxviruses derived from different animal species. In spite of close antigenic relationships, the poxviruses of rabbits that produce distinct disease syndromes are discussed as separate entities. Virus of the genus Papillomavirus cause papillomas in various animal species and includes two rabbit viruses, the cottontail rabbit papillomavirus and the rabbit oral papillomavirus. The genus Polyomavirus contains one virus of rabbits, the rabbit kidney vacuolating virus. Papillomatosis of wild cottontail rabbits is characterized by the presence of horny warts, usually on the neck, shoulders, or abdomen. The warts begin as red raised areas at the site of infection, grow to become typical papillomas with rough rounded surfaces, and may later develop into large, keratinized horny growths. The rabbit kidney vacuolating virus was isolated in primary rabbit kidney cell cultures from papillomas of cottontail rabbits collected in Kansas. This virus causes vacuolar cytopathic effects in cell cultures. The virus resembles the cottontail rabbit (Shope) papil lomavirus but is a distinct virus. It does not produce papillomas when inoculated into rabbits and does not immunize rabbits against rabbit papillomavirus.","DiGiacomo, Ronald F.; John Maré, C.",The Biology of the Laboratory Rabbit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149740/,209

Current practice during thoracic surgery is not well described. METHODS: This is a post-hoc analysis of the prospective multicenter cross-sectional LAS VEGAS study focusing on patients who underwent thoracic surgery. Consecutive adult patients receiving invasive ventilation during general anesthesia were included in a one-week period in 2013. Baseline characteristics, intraoperative and postoperative data were registered. PPCs were collected as composite endpoint until the 5th postoperative day. Patients were stratified into groups based on the use of one lung ventilation (OLV) or two lung ventilation (TLV), endoscopic vs. non-endoscopic approach and ARISCAT score risk for PPCs. Differences between subgroups were compared using χ(2) or Fisher exact tests or Student’s t-test. Kaplan–Meier estimates of the cumulative probability of development of PPC and hospital discharge were performed. Cox-proportional hazard models without adjustment for covariates were used to assess the effect of the subgroups on outcome. RESULTS: From 10,520 patients enrolled in the LAS VEGAS study, 302 patients underwent thoracic procedures and were analyzed. There were no differences in patient characteristics between OLV vs. TLV, or endoscopic vs. open surgery. Patients received V(T) of 7.4 ± 1.6 mL/kg, a PEEP of 3.5 ± 2.4 cmH(2)O, and driving pressure of 14.4 ± 4.6 cmH(2)O. Compared with TLV, patients receiving OLV had lower V(T) and higher peak, plateau and driving pressures, higher PEEP and respiratory rate, and received more recruitment maneuvers. There was no difference in the incidence of PPCs in OLV vs. TLV or in endoscopic vs. open procedures. Patients at high risk had a higher incidence of PPCs compared with patients at low risk (48.1% vs. 28.9%; hazard ratio, 1.95; 95% CI 1.05–3.61; p = 0.033). There was no difference in the incidence of severe PPCs. The in-hospital length of stay (LOS) was longer in patients who developed PPCs. Patients undergoing OLV, endoscopic procedures and at low risk for PPC had shorter LOS. CONCLUSION: PPCs occurred frequently and prolonged hospital LOS following thoracic surgery. Proportionally large tidal volumes and high driving pressure were commonly used in this sub-population. However, large RCTs are needed to confirm these findings.

39252,Letters to the Editor Re: Re-Engineering Academic Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology to Operate in a Pandemic World and Beyond–A Joint AGOS/CUCOG Statement,2020-09-17,"Auctioning revenues in the European Union Emissions Trading System are likely to increase in the future. This projection is driven by recent changes within the system’s framework, which address the current surplus of emission allowances and reduce the overall cap. Considering a growing amount of auctioning revenues, it becomes even more important to assess the use of these revenues and their potential contribution to accelerate decarbonisation efforts. We argue that strategic investments in energy efficiency programmes provide opportunities for realising multiple benefits: additional emission reductions from both ETS and non-ETS sectors, lower economic and societal decarbonisation costs and support for the political process to further tighten the ETS cap. Our assessment of the status of auctioning revenue use at the EU Member State level shows that Member States have made only limited use of these multiple benefits in recent years. In 2017, no more than 21.4% of total revenues have been strategically invested in energy efficiency programmes, as Member States have officially reported to the European Environment Agency’s reporting obligations database. However, efficiency programmes funded by auctioning revenues in Germany and Czech Republic present promising cases for the strategic use of auctioning revenues. We conclude that the EU carbon price can provide important signals to investors and energy users, but auctioning revenues can also be a powerful tool in the energy transition and the strategic use of revenues needs to be accelerated in all Member States.","Wiese, Catharina; Cowart, Richard; Rosenow, Jan",Energy Effic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7486585/,209

However, many publications on vaccine qBRm provide insufficient details on the methodological approaches used. Incomplete and/or inadequate qBRm reporting may affect result interpretation and confidence in BRA, highlighting a need for the development of standard reporting guidance. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to provide an operational checklist for improved reporting of vaccine qBRm. METHODS: The consolidated standards of reporting quantitative Benefit-RIsk models applied to VACcines (BRIVAC) were designed as a checklist of key information to report in qBRm scientific publications regarding the assessed vaccines, the methodological considerations and the results and their interpretation. RESULTS: In total, 22 items and accompanying definitions, recommendations, explanations and examples were provided and divided into six main sections corresponding to the classic subdivisions of a scientific publication: title and abstract (items 1–2), introduction (items 3–4), methods (items 5–15), results (items 16–17), discussion (items 18–20) and other (items 21–22). CONCLUSIONS: The BRIVAC checklist is the first initiative providing an operational checklist for improved reporting of qBRm applied to vaccines in scientific articles. It is intended to assist authors, peer-reviewers, editors and readers in their critical appraisal. Future initiatives are needed to provide methodological guidance to perform qBRm while taking into account the vaccine specificities.","Arlegui, Hugo; Bollaerts, Kaatje; Bauchau, Vincent; Nachbaur, Gaëlle; Bégaud, Bernard; Praet, Nicolas",Drug Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7486804/,209

Methods: An ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) method was constructed to identify compounds in rat serum after oral administration of XPF, and a component-target network was established using Cytoscape, between the targets of XPF ingredients and CHD with depression. Furthermore, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses were performed to deduce the mechanism of XPF in treating CHD with depression. Finally, in a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-and isoproterenol (ISO)-induced rat model, TUNEL was used to detect the apoptosis index of the myocardium and hippocampus, ELISA and western blot were used to detect the predicted hub targets, namely AngII, 5-HT, cAMP, PKA, CREB, BDNF, Bcl-2, Bax, Cyt-c, and caspase-3. Results: We identified 51 compounds in rat serum after oral administration of XPF, which mainly included phenolic acids, saponins, and flavonoids. Network pharmacology analysis revealed that XPF may regulate targets, such as ACE2, HTR1A, HTR2A, AKT1, PKIA, CREB1, BDNF, BCL2, BAX, CASP3, cAMP signaling pathway, and cell apoptosis process in the treatment of CHD with depression. ELISA analysis showed that XPF decreased Ang-II content in the circulation and central nervous system, inhibited 5-HT levels in peripheral circulation, and increased 5-HT content in the central nervous system and cAMP content in the myocardia and hippocampus. Meanwhile, western blot analysis indicated that XPF could upregulate the expression levels of PKA, CREB, and BDNF both in the myocardia and hippocampus. TUNEL staining indicated that the apoptosis index of myocardial and hippocampal cells increased in CUMS-and ISO-induced CHD in rats under depression, and XPF could increase the expression of Bcl-2, inhibit the expression of Bax, Cyt-c, and caspase-3, and rectify the injury of the hippocampus and myocardium, which exerted antidepressant and antimyocardial ischemia effects. Conclusion: Our study proposed an integrated strategy, combining serum pharmacochemistry and network pharmacology to investigate the mechanisms of XPF in treating CHD with depression. The mechanism of XPF in treating CHD with depression may be related to the activation of the cAMP signaling pathway and the inhibition of the apoptosis.","Zhang, Lihong; Zhang, Yu; Zhu, Mingdan; Pei, Limin; Deng, Fangjun; Chen, JinHong; Zhang, Shaoqiang; Cong, Zidong; Du, Wuxun; Xiao, Xuefeng",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8048422/,209

Effective control of metabolic parameters and their dysfunction may help prevent or minimize the acute and devastating effects of SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the local inflammatory response and blocking the entry of the virus into cells. With such consideration in mind, we gathered data from dietary surveys conducted in nine European countries to explore the relationship between actual clock hour of the large dinner meal and also interval in minutes between it and sunset in the respective countries and death rate above the median rate of per one million people as an index of mortality due to COVID-19 infection. Clock time of the dinner meal varied between 16:00 and 21:00 h across the European counties sampled, and the correlation between dinner mealtime and death rate was strongly correlated, R = 0.7991 (two-tailed p = 0.0098), with R 2 explaining 63% of the variation within the data. This strong linear positive correlation indicates that the later the clock time of the dinner meal, the higher is the death rate (and vice versa). The relationship between meal timing in reference to sunset, utilized as a gross surrogate marker of the activity/rest synchronizer of circadian rhythms, and death rate was negative and even slightly stronger, R = -0.8025 (two-tailed p = 0.0092), with R 2 explaining 64% of the variation within the data. This strong linear negative correlation indicates that the shorter the interval between the dinner meal and sunset, i.e., the closer the time of the largest meal of the day to bedtime, the greater is the death rate (and vice versa). Our preliminary approach to nighttime eating, in terms of the day's largest caloric intake, as a risk factor for the predisposing conditions of obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and other commonly associated comorbidities of being overweight, and death from COVID-19 infection reveals strong correlation with the time of the dinner meal, both in terms of its actual clock and circadian time.","Verd, Sergio; Beiro, Sara; Fernandez-Bernabeu, Marisa; Ponce-Taylor, Jaume",Chronobiology international,https://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2020.1772810; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32516020/,209

Variant films were prepared employing the casting method and using hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and polyvinyl alcohol. The formulated films were investigated for insulin content, weight variation, surface pH, thickness, folding endurance and disintegration time. In vitro release study was conducted for the selected formulations (F6, F7, F8). A drug/polymer interaction was investigated in the optimized formulation (F7) employing Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Clinical study was accomplished for F7 on 20 patients. Sniffin's and olfactory discrimination tests were used for assessing patients. The formulated films displayed appropriate physical characteristics. F7 showed the shortest disintegration time (50±7 seconds) and fastest release. It displayed compatibility between the drug and the used polymers. The results of the clinical study revealed a significant increase in the olfactory detection scores and olfactory discrimination values in the intervention group (7.9±1.2, 6.7±0.5 respectively) compared to placebo group (3±0.8, 2.8±1).. Intervention group showed significant differences between these scores before and after treatment while the placebo group did not display any significant differences. Thus, the optimized film can be considered as an auspicious approach for managing post COVID-19 anosmia.","Mohamad, Soad A; Badawi, Ahmed M; Mansour, Heba F",International journal of pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2021.120600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33862126/,209

Here, we developed a renal-accumulating DNA nanodevice with exclusive kidney retention for longitudinal protection of AKI in different stages in a renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) model. Due to the prolonged kidney retention time (>12 h), the ROS-sensitive nucleic acids of the nanodevice could effectively alleviate oxidative stress by scavenging ROS in stage I, and then the anticomplement component 5a (aC5a) aptamer loaded nanodevice could sequentially suppress the inflammatory responses by blocking C5a in stage II, which is directly related to the cytokine storm. This sequential therapy provides durable and pathogenic treatment of kidney dysfunction based on successive pathophysiological events induced by I/R, which holds great promise for renal management and the suppression of the cytokine storm in more broad settings including COVID-19.","Chen, Qian; Ding, Fei; Zhang, Shuangye; Li, Qian; Liu, Xiaoguo; Song, Haiyun; Zuo, Xiaolei; Fan, Chunhai; Mou, Shan; Ge, Zhilei",Nano letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c01044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33998787/,209

Machine learning (ML) algorithms may provide a method for identifying these individuals, and could be automated to directly alert providers in real time. OBJECTIVE This study applies ML techniques to electronic health record (EHR) data to identify an integrated risk-prediction model that can be deployed to predict risk of drug-induced QT prolongation. METHODS We examined harmonized data from the UCHealth EHR and identified inpatients who had received a medication known to prolong the QT interval. Using a binary outcome of the development of a QTc interval >500 ms within 24 hours of medication initiation or no ECG with a QTc interval >500 ms, we compared multiple machine learning methods by classification accuracy and performed calibration and rescaling of the final model. RESULTS We identified 35,639 inpatients who received a known QT-prolonging medication and an ECG performed within 24 hours of administration. Of those, 4,558 patients developed a QTc > 500 ms and 31,081 patients did not. A deep neural network with random oversampling of controls was found to provide superior classification accuracy (F1 score 0.404; AUC 0.71) for the development of a long QT interval compared with other methods. The optimal cutpoint for prediction was determined and was reasonably accurate (sensitivity 71%; specificity 73%). CONCLUSIONS We found that deep neural networks applied to EHR data provide reasonable prediction of which individuals are most susceptible to drug-induced QT prolongation. Future studies are needed to validate this model in novel EHRs and within the physician order entry system to assess the ability to improve patient safety.","Simon, Steven T; Mandair, Divneet; Tiwari, Premanand; Rosenberg, Michael A",Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1177/1074248421995348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33682475/,209
67776,Managing Lung Cancer during Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms with unfavorable anatomy (large aneurysms, wide-neck) is frequently challenging and is also associated with a high incidence of significant recurrences. The WEB, an intrasaccular flow disrupter, was designed for use in this type of aneurysm. We report our early experience with this device in this multicenter study. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty patients with 21 aneurysms were treated by using the WEB in 3 European centers. The ability to successfully deploy the WEB, immediate posttreatment angiographic results, adverse events, clinical outcome, and angiographic follow-up results were recorded. RESULTS Aneurysm location was the ICA (4/21, 19.1%), MCA (8/21, 38.1%), AcomA (5/21, 23.8%), and BA (4/21, 19.1%). No treatment failures were reported. Treatment was performed exclusively with the WEB in 16/21 (76.2%) patients. Additional treatment (coiling and/or stent placement) was used in 5/21 (23.8%) patients. One patient (4.8%) experienced transient clinical worsening (mRS 1 at 1 month, mRS 0 at 3 months) related to a thromboembolic event. Inadvertent detachment of the WEB was observed, and the WEB was retrieved in 1 patient, without adverse effects. In the short-term follow-up (2-8 months), adequate occlusion (total occlusion or neck remnant) was observed in 80.0% of aneurysms. CONCLUSIONS Intrasaccular flow disruption is a new endovascular approach for aneurysm treatment. In our preliminary experience, this treatment was feasible and mostly used in bifurcation aneurysms (MCA, BA, ICA) with unfavorable anatomy. Further studies are needed to precisely evaluate the indications, safety, and efficacy of this new technique.","Pierot, L; Liebig, T; Sychra, V; Kadziolka, K; Dorn, F; Strasilla, C; Kabbasch, C; Klisch, J",AJNR.

Up to 2-4% of colorectal cancer cases are a result of Lynch syndrome (LS), a hereditary cancer syndrome caused by a germline mutation in at least one of the DNA mismatch repair genes. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of LS in colorectal tumors during the first 15-months after the implementation of universal tumor-based screening for LS in Puerto Rico. METHODS A total of 317 colorectal tumors were evaluated in a large private pathology laboratory from September 2014 to December 2015. Clinical characteristics were obtained from the pathology reports. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were used to estimate the magnitude of association (odds ratio [OR] with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) between absent MMR protein expression and patient characteristics. RESULTS Most cases (93.4%) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry; 11.8% (35 of 296) had deficient mismatch repair protein expression. While 29 of the 317 cases were subjected to PCR-based microsatellite instability analysis of which 10.3% (3 of 317) had microsatellite instability. In total, 11.0% of the tumors were reported MMR deficient. These tumors were more likely from females and more likely localized in the proximal colon compared to those with proficient MMR expression. CONCLUSIONS Our data is consistent with the results from other studies including US Hispanics, where approximately 10% of Hispanic individuals with colorectal cancer have microsatellite instability. Our results support universal tumor-based screening for LS among Hispanics in accordance with National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.","Sierra, Isabel; Pérez-Mayoral, Julyann; Rosado, Kathia; Maldonado, Valerie; Alicea-Zambrana, Kimberly; Reyes, José S; Torres, Marla; Tous, Luis; Lopéz-Acevedo, Nicolas; Diaz-Algorrí, Yaritza; Carlo-Chevere, Victor; Rodriguez-Quilichini, Segundo; Cruz-Correa, Marcia",Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-020-00876-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006754/,209
70105,"Reply to ""Chest CT Findings and Clinical Conditions of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)"".",2020-04-14,"Purpose Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an effective treatment for oligometastatic or unresectable primary malignancies, although target proximity to organs at risk (OARs) within the ultracentral thorax (UCT) limits safe delivery of an ablative dose. Stereotactic magnetic resonance (MR)-guided online adaptive radiation therapy (SMART) may improve the therapeutic ratio using reoptimization to account for daily variation in target and OAR anatomy. This study assessed the feasibility of UCT SMART and characterized dosimetric and clinical outcomes in patients treated for UCT lesions on a prospective phase 1 trial. Methods and Materials Five patients with oligometastatic (n = 4) or unresectable primary (n = 1) UCT malignancies underwent SMART. Initial plans prescribed 50 Gy in 5 fractions with goal 95% planning target volume (PTV) coverage by 95% of prescription, subject to strict OAR constraints. Daily real-time online adaptive plans were created as needed to preserve hard OAR constraints, escalate PTV dose, or both, based on daily setup MR image set anatomy. Treatment times, patient outcomes, and dosimetric comparisons were prospectively recorded. Results All initial and daily adaptive plans met strict OAR constraints based on simulation and daily setup MR imaging anatomy, respectively. Four of the 5 patients received ≥1 adapted fraction. Ten of the 25 total delivered fractions were adapted. A total of 30% of plan adaptations were performed to improve PTV coverage; 70% were for reversal of ≥1 OAR violation. Local control by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors was 100% at 3 and 6 months. No grade ≥3 acute (within 6 months of radiation completion) treatment-related toxicities were identified. Conclusions SMART may allow PTV coverage improvement and/or OAR sparing compared with nonadaptive SBRT and may widen the therapeutic index of UCT SBRT. In this small prospective cohort, we found that SMART was clinically deliverable to 100% of patients, although treatment delivery times surpassed our predefined, timing-based feasibility endpoint. This technique is well tolerated, offering excellent local control with no identified acute grade ≥3 toxicity.","Henke, Lauren E; Olsen, Jeffrey R; Contreras, Jessika A; Curcuru, Austen; DeWees, Todd A; Green, Olga L; Michalski, Jeff; Mutic, Sasa; Roach, Michael C; Bradley, Jeffrey D; Parikh, Parag J; Kashani, Rojano; Robinson, Clifford G",Advances in radiation oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2018.10.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706029/,209

Shenzhen confirmed its first imported case from Wuhan on 19 January 2020. However, little is known regarding the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in these imported cities. METHODOLOGY Data of all 417 confirmed cases diagnosed in Shenzhen before 29 February were collected. The epidemiological characteristics of imported and local cases were compared. The resilience to COVID-19 was evaluated by discharge density. RESULTS All ten districts reported COVID-19 cases by 29 February, including 331 imported and 86 local cases. The Pearson linear correlation model showed the number of confirmed cases (r = 0.990, p < 0.001) as well as incidence of COVID-19 (r = 0.766, p = 0.010) was positively correlated with the gross domestic product of district. Family clusters were more commonly found in local cases. Imported patients had earlier onset (p < 0.001) and diagnosis (p < 0.001), but longer interval from onset to admission (p = 0.030), diagnosis (p = 0.003) and discharge (p = 0.016). Older and severe cases had lower discharge density (0.024 and 0.018, respectively); while cases with subclinical symptoms exhibited higher discharge density (0.052). CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients were predominantly imported cases in Shenzhen and the spatial distribution was closely related to district GDP. Imported and local cases differed in the intervals from onset to admission, diagnosis and discharge. Moreover, family-based transmission should not be ignored, especially in local cases.","Li, Zhihui; Wang, Jin; Huang, Jingyi; Lu, Jiahai",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.12801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32903229/,209

As widely known, attempts to culture porcine enteropathogenic coronaviruses, such as PDCoV and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, in cells have been proven to be difficult. This study aimed to establish an efficient and cost-effective culture system for PDCoV using embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs) to enable future vaccine production and efficient virus isolation from infected animals. The inoculation of samples into the allantoic cavity of 3- to 7-day-old ECEs yielded efficient virus propagation even from porcine fecal samples. Virus propagation in 2- and 8-day-old ECEs were confirmed in 30.0% and 11.1% of the samples, respectively. This indicates that susceptible cells rapidly develop in 2-day-old ECEs and differentiate to mature cells that are nonsusceptible to PDCoV in 8-day-old layer chicken ECEs. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that PDCoV can be passaged in 6-day-old ECEs with high viral replicative efficiency. This technique for propagating PDCoV using ECEs is a powerful tool that could be utilized for PDCoV vaccine development and virus isolation from poultry, livestock, and wild animals.","Iseki, Hiroshi; Watanabe, Satoko; Mase, Masaji",Journal of virological methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.114068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33460683/,209

One of the most frequent causes of death from SARS-CoV-2 is fatal pneumonia from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is associated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To date (as of April 2, 2020), other than supportive measures, there are no efficient therapeutic options for COVID-19-related ARDS, although the US Food and Drug Administration recently granted emergency authorization for the use of hydroxychoroquine/chloroquine for this indication (which is usually given with azithromycin). Although the pathogenesis for ARDS is under investigation, one of the major culprits is considered to be cytokine storm, especially from interleukin 6 (IL-6) release. Herein, we review potential use of IL-6 inhibitors, several of which are approved for other disease conditions, as potential novel treatment for the management of COVID-19-related ARDS.","Kato, Shumei; Kurzrock, Razelle",Journal of immunotherapy and precision oncology,https://doi.org/10.36401/jipo-20-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34169296/,209

72398,Changes in Lung Cancer Treatment as a Result of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic.,2020-09-17,"BACKGROUND Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) is a laparoscopic surgery in which a single small incision is made, associated with the use of a special device (single-port), or several small incisions grouped in one location (single-incision) are made, through which the laparoscopic trocars are inserted. The incision is made in the abdomen, preferably in the umbilicus. Certain peculiarities are noted in this approach, such as the difficulty, and sometimes the impossibility, of centering the image, the need to move both the camera and instruments together, requiring even more delicate and precise movements than in laparoscopy. Since information on training for LESS is scarce in the current literature, the authors report their experience with five different cases of this nature, performed in two porcine models, and then discuss a training plan for LESS. METHODS Five LESS procedures were performed in two pigs using different training techniques: two (one single-port and one single-incision) transumbilical laparoscopic cholecystectomies; one right-sided single-incision laparoscopic radical nephrectomy; one single-incision transumbilical laparoscopic radical nephrectomy; and one single-port transumbilical laparoscopic nephrectomy. DISCUSSION Different from what was observed in the transition from open surgery to laparoscopy, the Halstedian model should not be used in the teaching of LESS since this procedure requires that professionals partner together, thus requiring not only the training of surgeons, but of the whole team. CONCLUSION LESS procedures are feasible and considered as further refinements in laparoscopic techniques. However, the peculiarities and difficulties inherent in these procedures require a specific training program combining theory and practice. The authors believe that this training is essential to achieve proficiency levels before the technique can be tried on human subjects.","Müller, Enrico Mattana; Cavazzola, Leandro Totti; Machado Grossi, João Vicente; Mariano, Mirandolino Batista; Morales, Cláudio; Brun, Maurício",International journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2009.11.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19931656/,209

However, these appears insufficient body of experimental data to advise the health care worker or patient. Examine penetration effect (hence potential for altering efficacy and toxicity) - dosing with one topical after another and how quickly such a potential phenomenon might occur. METHODS A marketed moisturizer applied on human skin with an in vitro diffusion system. At 1, 15, and 30 min post application, [14C]-benzoic acid dosed the same skin site for 24 h. Amounts of chemical retained in skin and permeation flux rats were measured to determine penetration effect of the prior moisturizer application. RESULTS Exposure of a water-enriched moisturizer before a hydrophilic chemical immediate application favors the chemical penetration, especial in 1 and 15 min moisturizer exposure groups. The enhancement effect was expressed as an earlier lag time and a rapid absorption peak when compared to related non-moisturizer control. CONCLUSION This experiment opens up a large door: what would be the result with many complex topical products and different tracers was used here, of varying hydrophilicity and lipophilicity.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of immunochromatographic tests (ICTs) for the detection of norovirus in stool specimens, which has not been performed previously. In this systematic review and meta-analysis (registered on PROSPERO, CRD42020186911), we searched Medline/PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for all studies published up to 16 May 2020. The values for sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), negative likelihood ratio (LR-), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of ICTs with 95% confidence interval (CI) were pooled using a bivariate random-effects model. The summary receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve were used to summarize overall test accuracy. We included 43 studies describing 7,428 samples. The overall estimates of sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR-, DOR, and accuracy of ICT for diagnosing norovirus were 0.61 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.67), 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95 to 0.98), 17.08 (95% CI, 11.15 to 26.18), 0.40 (95% CI, 0.34 to 0.46), 53.9 (95% CI, 31.32 to 92.78), and 0.928, respectively. Significant differences in pooled sensitivities were noted between age groups and in pooled DOR and LR+ between genogroups of included samples. ICT provides low sensitivity but high specificity and accuracy for detecting norovirus. Thus, an ICT for norovirus can be a rapid and convenient way for identifying patients early; however, a negative result cannot rule out norovirus infection and should be confirmed by a reference test.","Yoon, Seo Hee; Kim, Hye Rim; Ahn, Jong Gyun",Microbiology spectrum,https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00467-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34232095/,209

Real-time ultrasound visualization is limited during ablation due to gas production. This study assesses the feasibility of fusing volumetric contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), obtained immediately prior to microwave ablation, with real-time CEUS during and following ablation in a machine-perfused porcine liver. METHODS Ten, 3-4 cm microwave ablations were performed in five explanted perfused livers. Prior to ablation, microbubbles were injected into the vasculature while an ultrasound sweep across the liver captured a volumetric image during maximum enhancement. This volumetric image was then fused to overlay the real-time ultrasound imaging. Since the perfused livers did not have tumors, a spherical marker circumscribing a target volume was placed on the images. Approximatively, 75% of the total intended circumscribed spherical volume was ablated. Following ablation, a second bolus injection of ultrasound contrast was administered demonstrating continued enhancement of the intentionally non-ablated 25%. A second volumetric image of the post-ablation CEUS was then fused to overlay the real-time ultrasound images for guidance during ablation of the remaining enhancing volume. RESULTS Technical success was achieved in 100% of the cases. The pre- and then the post-ablation CEUS volume was fused with real-time imaging during antenna placement for initial and subsequent ablation. CONCLUSION CEUS-CEUS fusion during thermal ablation is feasible and greatly improves the workflow. The approach may augment the use of dynamic CEUS for guidance, improving antenna placement, and aiding in the identification and ablation of initial and residual enhancing tissue.","Monsky, Wayne; Keravnou, Christina; Averkiou, Michalakis",Journal of ultrasound,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40477-019-00366-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811016/,209

They are closely temporally aligned to the prosodic characteristics of the speech signal, typically occurring on lexically stressed syllables. Despite their prevalence across speakers of the world's languages, how beat gestures impact spoken word recognition is unclear. Can these simple 'flicks of the hand' influence speech perception? Across a range of experiments, we demonstrate that beat gestures influence the explicit and implicit perception of lexical stress (e.g. distinguishing OBject from obJECT), and in turn can influence what vowels listeners hear. Thus, we provide converging evidence for a manual McGurk effect: relatively simple and widely occurring hand movements influence which speech sounds we hear.","Bosker, Hans Rutger; Peeters, David",Proceedings.

METHODS We conducted a 10-year retrospective analysis of VNS implantations at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Relevant data were collected within 12 months of VNS implantation and at six months, one, two, and four years after VNS implantation. RESULTS This analysis included 99 patients ages 0-3 (n = 40) and 4-6 (n = 59) at first VNS implantation. Eighty-six patients followed up for ≥4 years. There were no significant differences between age at VNS implant (0-3 vs. 4-6) and seizure etiology or most seizure semiologies. Patients took an average of 3.01 ± 1.29 AEDs prior to VNS and 3.84 ± 1.68 AEDs at their latest follow-up. The overall response to VNS therapy (≥50% seizure reduction) at one year, two years, and four years after VNS implantation was 55%, 60%, and 52%, respectively. At two years, 59% of 0- to 3-year-old patients responded to VNS and 52% of 4- to 6-year-old patients responded to VNS. The overall major complication rate was 5.6%, consistent with VNS use for older age groups. SIGNIFICANCE This study demonstrates the safety and efficacy of VNS for children with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) younger than six. One, two, and four years after VNS implantation, 55%, 60%, and 52% of these patients, respectively, achieved ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency. The safety of VNS is also comparable with older, better studied, age groups. Based on these data, VNS therapy should be considered for children younger than six.","Muthiah, Nallammai; Zhang, Jun; Remick, Madison; Welch, William; Sogawa, Yoshimi; Jeong, Jong-Hyeon; Abel, Taylor J",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32942207/,209
81042,Frequency of asthma exacerbation in children during the coronavirus disease pandemic with strict mitigative countermeasures.,2021-03-08,"INTRODUCTION Since 2010, General Ophthalmic Services (GOS) legislation and Independent Prescribing (IP) enable community optometrists to manage primary eye conditions. No studies have assessed the effect of IP. We wished to determine the distribution of IP optometrists and associated hospital referral rates across Scotland. METHODS In 2019, FOI requests (General Optical Council and NHS Education Scotland) identified all registered IP optometrists in Scotland and their registered postcodes. Data regarding community eye examinations and referrals to HES since 2010 were gathered via Information Services Division of NHS Scotland. RESULTS As of March 2019, there were 278 IP optometrists in Scotland (278/1189; 23.4%). Two hundred eighteen IP optometrists work in 293 practices across 11 of Scotland's 14 health boards. There was a strong correlation (r = +0.96) between population density and number of IP optometrists. Fifty-six percent of IP optometrists work in the two most deprived quintiles. Since IP's introduction, there has been a marked increase in anterior segment supplementary visits (+290%). Optometry referrals to GPs have reduced by 10.5%, but referrals to HES have increased by 118% (to 96,315). There was no correlation between quantity of IP optometrists and referral rates to HES (r = -0.06, 95% CI -0.64 to 0.56, p = 0.86). CONCLUSIONS This is the first analysis of IP optometrists and associated referral rates in Scotland. Despite good geographical distribution and increased supplementary attendances, optometric referrals to HES have doubled and continue to rise. We propose a ratio of primary, supplementary, non-referral and referral rates to discern the true impact of IP versus non-IP community optometric behaviour.","El-Abiary, Mariam; Loffler, Gunter; Young, David; Strang, Niall; Lockington, David",Eye,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-020-1095-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32681093/,209

Thus, we adapted the use of the blunt Bovie tip, which can be used with or without electrocautery to perform the myotomy. This study compared the outcomes between using the arthrotomy knife versus the Bovie blade in laparoscopic pyloromyotomies. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective review was performed on all laparoscopic pyloromyotomy patients from October 2007 to September 2012. Arthrotomy knife pyloromyotomy patients were compared with those performed with the Bovie blade. Patient demographics, diagnostic measurements, electrolyte levels, length of stay, operative time, and complications were compared. RESULTS A total of 381 patients were included, with 191 in the arthrotomy group and 190 in the Bovie blade group. No significant differences existed between groups in age, weight, gender, pyloric dimensions, electrolyte levels, or length of stay. Mean operative times were 15.8±5.6 min with knife and 16.4±5.3 min for Bovie blade (P=0.24). In the arthrotomy knife group, there was one incomplete pyloromyotomy and one omental herniation. There was one wound infection in each group. Readmission rate was greater in the arthrotomy knife group (5.7%) versus the Bovie blade group (3.1%). CONCLUSIONS The Bovie blade appears to offer no objective disadvantages compared with the arthrotomy knife when performing laparoscopic pyloromyotomy.","Thomas, Priscilla G; Sharp, Nicole E; St Peter, Shawn D",The Journal of surgical research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2014.03.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24739509/,209

Changes in the biodistribution of radiopharmaceuticals could give information on early toxicity. Ten-week-old CD1 male mice were divided into four groups. Two groups were administered a weekly dose of 5 mg/kg of doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) for 5 weeks and the control groups were administered saline solution. One week after the end of treatment, the biodistribution of 18F-FDG and 67Ga-citrate were carried out, as was the quantification of plasma enzymes CK, CK-MB, LDH and AST. All enzymes were higher in the treated animals, but only significant (p < 0.05) in the case of CK-MB. 18F-FDG uptake increased in all organs of treated animals except retroperitoneal fat, being significant in spleen, brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, and inguinal fat. 67Ga-citrate had a more complex pattern. The uptake in the DOX group was higher in spleen, lung, kidney, testes, and gonadal fat, it did not change in brain, heart, and liver, and it was lower in the rest of the organs. It only showed significant differences in lung and pancreas. A thorough discussion of the possible causes that produced the change in biodistributions of both radiopharmaceuticals is included. The pilot study showed that both radiopharmaceuticals could identify early multi-organ toxicity induced by DOX. Although 18F-FDG seems to be better, 67Ga-citrato should not be ruled out a priori. The detection of early toxicity would serve to adopt treatments that prevent its progression, thus improving patient's quality of life.","Córdoba-Adaya, Julio César; Oros-Pantoja, Rigoberto; Torres-García, Eugenio; Morales-Ávila, Enrique; Aranda-Lara, Liliana; Santillán-Benítez, Jonnathan G; Hernández-Herrera, Neri O; Otero, Gloria; Isaac-Olivé, Keila",Toxicology mechanisms and methods,https://doi.org/10.1080/15376516.2021.1937420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34057017/,209

Nurses are not immune to xenophobia and racism, both as perpetrators and as victims. Although COVID-19 brings a new wave of xenophobia and racism, healthcare organisations have been tackling discriminatory and racist practices for decades. However, racist practice quite often goes undetected or unchallenged due to its associated sensitivity and a lack of understanding of its complexity. There is a need for a more open and non-judgemental discourse around interpretations of racism and its predisposing factors as a means of combating the growing reports. This discussion paper proposes a practice-orientated conceptualisation of racism and outlines some particular and sustainable areas for consideration for nurses to use in their daily practice.

This is particularly relevant to policymaking during the coronavirus pandemic and racial inequality highlighted during the support for the Black Lives Matter movement. A literature review was performed to define bias, identify the impact of bias on clinical practice and research as well as clinical decision making (cognitive bias). Bias training could bridge the gap from the lack of awareness of bias to the ability to recognise bias in others and within ourselves. However, there are no effective debiasing strategies. Awareness of implicit bias must not deflect from wider socio-economic, political and structural barriers as well ignore explicit bias such as prejudice.","Gopal, Dipesh P; Chetty, Ula; O'Donnell, Patrick; Gajria, Camille; Blackadder-Weinstein, Jodie",Future healthcare journal,https://doi.org/10.7861/fhj.2020-0233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33791459/,209

Such adaptive responses are regulated by a complex set of systemic signals, including hormones and neuropeptides. While much progress has been made in identifying pathways that regulate nutrient-excessive states, it is still incompletely understood how animals systemically signal their nutrient-deficient states. Here, we showed that the FMRFamide neuropeptide FLP-20 modulates a systemic starvation response in Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that mutation of flp-20 rescued the starvation hypersensitivity of the G protein β-subunit gpb-2 mutants by suppressing excessive autophagy. FLP-20 acted in AIB neurons, where the metabotropic glutamate receptor MGL-2 also functions to modulate a systemic starvation response. Furthermore, FLP-20 modulated starvation-induced fat degradation in a manner dependent on the receptor-type guanylate cyclase GCY-28. Collectively, our results reveal a circuit that senses and signals nutrient-deficient states to modulate a systemic starvation response in multicellular organisms.","Kang, Chanhee; Avery, Leon",Molecules and cells,https://doi.org/10.14348/molcells.2021.0051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140426/,209

We performed a retrospective review of 344 patients who underwent transsphenoidal surgery at our institution between 2006 and 2012. Postoperative hyponatremia was seen in 18.0% of patients at a mean of 3.9 days postoperatively. Hyponatremia was most commonly mild (51.6%) and clinically asymptomatic (93.8%). SIADH was the primary cause of hyponatremia in the majority of cases (n = 44, 71.0%), followed by cerebral salt wasting (n = 15, 24.2%) and desmopressin over-administration (n = 3, 4.8%). The incidence of postoperative hyponatremia was significantly higher in patients with cardiac, renal and/or thyroid disease (p = 0.0034, Objective Risk (OR) = 2.60) and in female patients (p = 0.011, OR = 2.18) or patients undergoing post-operative cerebrospinal fluid drainage (p = 0.0006).

Transmission of the virus is predominantly direct, through exposure to infected respiratory secretions. As far as we know, arthropods play a key role in the transmission and spread of several viruses, and thus their role in the spread of COVID-19 deserves to be studied. The biological transmission of viral agents through insects is very complex. While mechanical transmission is more likely to happen, biological transmission is possible via blood-sucking arthropods, but this requires a high grade of compatibility between the vector and the pathogen. If the biological and mechanical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by blood-sucking arthropods is excluded, a mechanical transmission by urban pests could take place. This risk is very low but it could be important in isolated environmental conditions, where other means of transmission are not possible. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in non-blood-sucking arthropods in infected buildings, like hospitals and retirement homes, should be investigated.","Dutto, M; Lauria, G; Drago, A; Martini, S; Gorrasi, I; Gilli, G",Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunita,https://doi.org/10.7416/ai.2021.2441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33779675/,209
95863,Investigation on the psychological status of college students during the coronavirus disease-2019 epidemic.,2021-03-12,"BACKGROUND Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin may reduce mortality in patients with viral respiratory diseases, and are currently being investigated in trials as potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding the benefits and risks is required. OBJECTIVES: To continually assess, as more evidence becomes available, whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in treatment of people with COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article Database and trial registries to identify completed and ongoing studies on 4 June 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19, irrespective of study design, disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) and studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for controlled non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), and the assessment criteria for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer for non-controlled NRSIs. MAIN RESULTS: This is the first living update of our review. We included 20 studies (1 RCT, 3 controlled NRSIs, 16 non-controlled NRSIs) with 5443 participants, of whom 5211 received convalescent plasma, and identified a further 98 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 50 are randomised. We did not identify any completed studies evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. Overall risk of bias of included studies was high, due to study design, type of participants, and other previous or concurrent treatments. Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 We included results from four controlled studies (1 RCT (stopped early) with 103 participants, of whom 52 received convalescent plasma; and 3 controlled NRSIs with 236 participants, of whom 55 received convalescent plasma) to assess effectiveness of convalescent plasma. Control groups received standard care at time of treatment without convalescent plasma. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge (1 controlled NRSI, 21 participants) We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma has any effect on all-cause mortality at hospital discharge (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.31; very low-certainty evidence). Time to death (1 RCT, 103 participants; 1 controlled NRSI, 195 participants) We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma prolongs time to death (RCT: hazard ratio (HR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.82; controlled NRSI: HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.96; very low-certainty evidence). Improvement of clinical symptoms, assessed by need for respiratory support (1 RCT, 103 participants; 1 controlled NRSI, 195 participants) We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma has any effect on improvement of clinical symptoms at seven days (RCT: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.19), 14 days (RCT: RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.77; controlled NRSI: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.29), and 28 days (RCT: RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.81; very low-certainty evidence). Quality of life No studies reported this outcome. Safety of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 We included results from 1 RCT, 3 controlled NRSIs and 10 non-controlled NRSIs assessing safety of convalescent plasma. Reporting of adverse events and serious adverse events was variable. The controlled studies reported on adverse events and serious adverse events only in participants receiving convalescent plasma. The duration of follow-up varied. Some, but not all, studies included death as a serious adverse event. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (13 studies, 201 participants) The studies did not report the grade of adverse events. Thirteen studies (201 participants) reported on adverse events of possible grade 3 or 4 severity. The majority of these adverse events were allergic or respiratory events. We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of moderate to severe adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events (14 studies, 5201 participants) Fourteen studies (5201 participants) reported on serious adverse events. The majority of participants were from one non-controlled NRSI (5000 participants), which reported only on serious adverse events limited to the first four hours after convalescent plasma transfusion. This study included death as a serious adverse event; they reported 15 deaths, four of which they classified as potentially, probably or definitely related to transfusion. Other serious adverse events reported in all studies were predominantly allergic or respiratory in nature, including anaphylaxis, transfusion-associated dyspnoea, and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma affects the number of serious adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma is beneficial for people admitted to hospital with COVID-19. For safety outcomes we also included non-controlled NRSIs. There was limited information regarding adverse events. Of the controlled studies, none reported on this outcome in the control group. There is only very low-certainty evidence for safety of convalescent plasma for COVID-19. While major efforts to conduct research on COVID-19 are being made, problems with recruiting the anticipated number of participants into these studies are conceivable. The early termination of the first RCT investigating convalescent plasma, and the multitude of studies registered in the past months illustrate this. It is therefore necessary to critically assess the design of these registered studies, and well-designed studies should be prioritised. Other considerations for these studies are the need to report outcomes for all study arms in the same way, and the importance of maintaining comparability in terms of co-interventions administered in all study arms. There are 98 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 50 are RCTs. This is the first living update of the review, and we will continue to update this review periodically. These updates may show different results to those reported here.","Piechotta, Vanessa; Chai, Khai Li; Valk, Sarah J; Doree, Carolyn; Monsef, Ina; Wood, Erica M; Lamikanra, Abigail; Kimber, Catherine; McQuilten, Zoe; So-Osman, Cynthia; Estcourt, Lise J; Skoetz, Nicole",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013600.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648959/,209
98134,"Incidence of myocardial injury in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a pooled analysis of 7,679 patients from 53 studies.",2020-08-01,"NEW FINDINGS What is the central question of this study? Is the magnitude of neuromuscular fatigue dependent upon exercise intensity above critical power (CP) when W' (the curvature constant of the power-duration relationship) is depleted? What is the main finding and its importance? The magnitude of neuromuscular fatigue is the same after two bouts of supra-CP cycling (3 versus 12 min) when controlling for W' depletion but is larger for individuals of greater anaerobic capacity after the shorter bout and smaller for individuals of greater aerobic capacity after the longer exercise bout. These findings provide new insight into the mechanisms underpinning exercise above CP. ABSTRACT The aim of the present study was to test whether the development of neuromuscular fatigue within the severe-intensity domain could be linked to the depletion of the curvature constant (W') of the power-duration relationship. Twelve recreationally active men completed tests to determine peak oxygen consumption, critical power (CP) and W', followed by two randomly assigned constant-load supra-CP trials set to deplete W' fully in 3 (P-3) and 12 min (P-12). Pre- to postexercise changes in maximal voluntary contraction, potentiated quadriceps twitch force evoked by single (Qpot ) and paired high- (PS100) and low-frequency (PS10) stimulations and voluntary activation were determined. Cycling above CP reduced maximal voluntary contraction (P-3, -20 ± 10% versus P-12, -15 ± 7%), measures associated with peripheral fatigue (Qpot , -35 ± 13 versus -31 ± 14%; PS10, -38 ± 13 versus -37 ± 17%; PS100, -18 ± 9 versus -13 ± 8% for P-3 and P-12, respectively) and voluntary activation (P-3, -12 ± 3% versus P-12, -13 ± 3%; P < 0.05), with no significant difference between trials (P > 0.05). Changes in maximal voluntary contraction and evoked twitch forces were inversely correlated with CP and peak oxygen consumption after P-12, whereas W' was significantly correlated with changes in Qpot and PS10 after P-3 (P < 0.05). Therefore, the magnitude of neuromuscular fatigue does not depend on exercise intensity when W' is fully exhausted during severe-intensity exercise; nonetheless, exploration of inter-individual variations suggests that mechanisms underpinning exercise tolerance within this domain differ between short- and long-duration exercise.","Schäfer, Lisa U; Hayes, Mark; Dekerle, Jeanne",Experimental physiology,https://doi.org/10.1113/ep087273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30468691/,209

98609,Food-Seeking Behaviors and Food Insecurity Risk During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic.,2021-06-24,"BACKGROUND Achilles tendon ruptures are a common injury and are increasing in incidence. Several management strategies exist for both non-operative and operative care, with each strategy offering unique risks and benefits. Traditional pairwise meta-analyses have been performed to compare management strategies; however, all treatment options have never been integrated in a single analysis. Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a generalization of pairwise meta-analysis, which allows for the comparison of multiple interventions based on all available direct and indirect evidence. The objectives of this review are to synthesize the evidence on the management options for acute Achilles tendon rupture and identify which treatment gives the best functional outcomes. METHODS A systematic review with NMA is planned. An electronic literature search will be performed in conjunction with an experienced information specialist in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We will include randomized controlled trials with a minimum 6-month follow-up. Two independent reviewers will screen citations for eligibility, extract study data, and perform risk of bias assessments. The primary outcome will be disease-specific functional outcome scores (AOFAS, Leppilahti, modified Leppilahti) at 1 year. Secondary outcomes will include complications (re-rupture, sural nerve injury, wound complications, deep infection, secondary surgeries), strength, range of motion, return to work, return to sport, and quality-of-life measures (including the SF-36 questionnaire). Traditional pairwise meta-analyses will be performed for all direct comparisons where evidence is available, and NMAs will subsequently be performed where possible to compare all management strategies. DISCUSSION The data generated from this review will provide health-care providers with a clear evidence synthesis of all Achilles tendon rupture management strategies. Additionally, these data will be incorporated into the development of a patient decision aid to assist patients and clinicians in making a preference-based decision when faced with an Achilles tendon rupture.

99759,Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients 80 Years and Older Hospitalized with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).,2020-10-23,"OBJECTIVES To describe the effects of 2 pain treatments for shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS), and illustrate how investigators can use pain quality information to understand treatment response differences. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study presents pain quality data from a randomized open-label study comparing the effects of an injection of triamcinolone and up to twice daily application of a heated lidocaine/tetracaine (Trilexis) patch in individuals with SIS. Study participants completed a measure of pain quality at baseline and again on study days 14, 28, and 42 following initiation of 2 treatments for SIS. Baseline and posttreatment pain quality scores were graphed to provide a visual representation of treatment-associated changes. Analyses of variance were used to examine the differences between treatment conditions in changes in pain quality with treatment. RESULTS Both treatments resulted in substantial (and similar) pretreatment to posttreatment improvements in many pain qualities. However, differences in the time course of treatment effects were observed for itchy and heavy qualities. DISCUSSION Although 2 different pain treatments appear to have the same effects when only pretreatment to posttreatment changes are examined, treatment differences emerged when the time course of treatment is examined. The findings support the importance of assessing both pain qualities and time course of treatment as outcome domains. The results illustrate how investigators can use data from clinical trials to provide a more fine-tuned description of treatment effects, providing knowledge that could be helpful in selecting treatment options at the individual patient level. SUMMARY Examination of the effects of pain treatments on pain qualities over time will help researchers and clinicians understand if certain pain quality domains respond faster to one treatment versus another, and may identify differences between treatments that would not be observed by measures of global pain intensity alone.","Jensen, Mark P; Trudeau, Jeremiah J; Radnovich, Richard; Galer, Bradley S; Gammaitoni, Arnold R",The Clinical journal of pain,https://doi.org/10.1097/ajp.0000000000000130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25329142/,209

107847,Cardiac manifestation of corona virus disease 2019: a preliminary report.,2021-01-14,"Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are small DNA viruses carried by diverse vertebrates. The evolutionary relationships of viruses and hosts remain largely unclear due to very limited surveillance in sympatric communities. In order to investigate whether PyVs can transmit among different mammalian species and to identify host-switching events in the field we conducted a systematic study of a large collection of bats (n=1,083) from 29 sympatric communities across China which contained multiple species with frequent contact. PyVs were detected in 21 bat communities with 192 PyVs identified in 186 bats from 15 species within 6 families representing at least 28 newly-described PyVs. Surveillance results and phylogenetic analyses surprisingly revealed three inter-family PyV host-switching events in these sympatric bat communities: two distinct PyVs were identified in two bat species in restricted geographical locations, while another PyV clustered phylogenetically with PyVs carried by bats from a different host family. Virus-host relationships of all discovered PyVs were also evaluated and no additional host-switching events were found. PyVs were identified in different horseshoe bat species in sympatric communities without observation of host-switching events, showed high genomic identities, clustered with each other. This suggested that even for PyVs with high genomic identities in closely-related host species, the potential for host-switching is low. In summary, our findings revealed that PyV host-switching in sympatric bat communities can occur but is limited, and host-switching events of bat-borne PyVs are relatively rare on the predominantly evolutionary background of co-divergence with their hosts.ImportanceSince the discovery of murine polyomavirus in the 1950s, polyomaviruses (PyVs) have been considered highly host-restricted in mammals. Sympatric bat communities commonly contain several different bat species in an ecological niche facilitating viral transmission, and therefore represent a model to identify host-switching events of PyVs. In this study, we screened PyVs in a large number of bats in sympatric communities from diverse habitats across China. We provide evidence that cross-species bat-borne PyV transmission exists, though is limited and that host-switching events appear relatively rare during the evolutionary history of these viruses. PyVs with close genomic identities were also identified in different bat species without host-switching events. Based on these findings, we propose an evolutionary scheme for bat-borne PyVs in which limited host-switching events occur on the background of co-divergence and lineage duplication generating the viral genetic diversity in bats.","Tan, Zhizhou; Gonzalez, Gabriel; Sheng, Jinliang; Wu, Jianmin; Zhang, Fuqiang; Xu, Lin; Zhang, Peisheng; Zhu, Aiwei; Qu, Yonggang; Tu, Changchun; Carr, Michael J; He, Biao",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02101-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32075934/,209

The objective of this commentary is to evaluate some of the challenges faced by undocumented farmworkers in the context of the current global pandemic and possible risk mitigation strategies. Undocumented farmworkers make considerable contributions to the U.S. economy and food production, but they are at an elevated risk for contracting Covid-19. Their risk is compounded by their employment and legal status, as well as their poor working and living conditions which makes it difficult for them to observe Covid-19 precautionary measures. U.S. immigration policy disincentivizes undocumented farmworkers from seeking healthcare services. Contact tracing challenges could be overcome by gaining trust with subsequent increased testing and care.

Currently, there are no effective drugs against HFMD. EV71 3C protease performs multiple tasks in the viral replication, which makes it an ideal antiviral target. We synthesized a small set of fluorogenic model peptides derived from cleavage sites of EV71 polyprotein and examined their efficiencies of cleavage by EV71 3C protease. The novel peptide P08 [(2-(N-methylamino)benzoyl) (NMA)-IEALFQGPPK(DNP)FR] was determined to be the most efficiently cleaved by EV71 3C protease, with a kinetic constant kcat/Km of 11.8 ± 0.82 mM(-1) min(-1). Compared with literature reports, P08 gave significant improvement in the signal/background ratio, which makes it an attractive substrate for assay development. A Molecular dynamics simulation study elaborated the interactions between substrate P08 and EV71 3C protease. Arg39, which is located at the bottom of the S2 pocket of EV71 3C protease, may participate in the proteolysis process of substrates. With an aim to evaluate EV71 3C protease inhibitors, a reliable and robust biochemical assay with a Z' factor of 0.87 ± 0.05 was developed. A novel compound (compound 3) (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 1.89 ± 0.25 μM) was discovered using this assay, which effectively suppressed the proliferation of EV 71 (strain Fuyang) in rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells with a highly selective index (50% effective concentration [EC50] = 4.54 ± 0.51 μM; 50% cytotoxic concentration [CC50] > 100 μM).

Here, we identified 172 Cd-responsive lncRNAs and 295 differentially expressed target genes in the leaves of Populus tomentosa under Cd treatment. Functional annotation revealed that these lncRNAs involved in various processes, including photosynthesis, hormone regulation, and phenylalanine metabolism. Association studies identified 78 significant associations, representing 14 Cd-responsive lncRNAs and 28 target genes for photosynthetic and leaf physiological traits. Epistasis uncovered 83 pairwise interactions among these traits, unveiling Cd-responsive lncRNA-mediated genetic networks for photosynthesis and leaf physiology in P. tomentosa. We then focused on the roles of two Cd-responsive lncRNA-gene pairs, MSTRG.22608.1-PtoMYB73 and MSTRG.5634.1-PtoMYB27, in Cd tolerance of Populus, and detected insertions/deletions within lncRNAs as polymorphisms driving target gene expression. LncRNAs genotype analysis and heterologous overexpressing PtoMYB73 and PtoMYB27 in Arabidopsis indicated their positive effects on enhancing Cd tolerance, photosynthetic rate, and leaf growth, and the potential interaction mechanisms of PtoMYB73 with abiotic stresses.

We have previously shown (Zhu et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 99:5573-5578, 2002) that ORF45 suppresses activation of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), a crucial regulator of type I interferon gene expression, by blocking its virus-induced phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation. We report here further characterization of the mechanisms by which ORF45 inhibits IRF7 phosphorylation. In most cell types, IRF7 is phosphorylated and activated by IKKε and TBK1 after viral infection. We found that phosphorylation of IRF7 on Ser477 and Ser479 by IKKε or TBK1 is inhibited by ORF45. The inhibition is specific to IRF7 because phosphorylation of its close relative IRF3 is not affected by ORF45, implying that ORF45 does not inactivate the kinases directly. In fact, we found that ORF45 is phosphorylated efficiently on Ser41 and Ser162 by IKKε and TBK1. We demonstrated that ORF45 competes with the associated IRF7 and inhibits its phosphorylation by IKKε or TBK1 by acting as an alternative substrate.","Liang, Qiming; Fu, Bishi; Wu, Fayi; Li, Xiaojuan; Yuan, Yan; Zhu, Fanxiu",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.05224-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22787218/,209

METHOD Over a 3-year period, all patients who underwent core biopsy to investigate lymphoma at our centre were included. RESULTS 554 consecutive patients were included (40.1% prior lymphoma and 59.4% new presentations). Three or more cores were taken in 420 (75.8%) cases. Median time from request to biopsy and biopsy to histology report was 2 (0-40) days and 7 (1-24) days respectively. 510/544 (93.8%) biopsies were diagnostic. There was no difference in whether the biopsy was diagnostic based on indication (new vs. relapsed lymphoma) (p=0.445), whether biopsy was PET-directed (p=0.507), for T-cell lymphoma (p=0.468) or nodal vs. extra-nodal (p=0.693). Thirty-eight patients (6.9%) required a second biopsy due to inadequate tissue. In a patient experience survey, only 13.9% reported any complications (1 self-limiting minor bleeding, 4 bruising) whilst 16.7% reported any discomfort beyond 12 hours.

Patients were divided into two groups depending on tacks used: Titanium tacks vs absorbable tacks. RESULTS All patients received totally laparoscopic incisional hernia repair by the use of lightweight polypropylene mesh. No major post-operative complications were reported. Post-operative pain (evaluated by VNS) was higher in Group A (titanium tacks, p < 0.05). No differences in follow-up as well as in recurrence incidence (one case in both groups, <6 months time interval) were reported. CONCLUSIONS Securestrap™ absorbable tacks are safe and effective and easy to use and did not increase the risk of mesh dislocation compared with non-absorbable tacks.

With the differences in health care systems and lockdown policies in various regions, the pandemic's effect on organ donation and transplant service may vary. Most of the deceased donor organ referrals in our hospital came from non-intensive care units (ICUs). The objective of this study is to report our experience and quantify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on deceased donor organ donation in our center. METHODS This was a retrospective observational study comparing the deceased donor organ donation activity during the period January 23 to November 30, 2020 with the same period in 2018 in Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong. RESULTS There was a 26.9% reduction in deceased donor organ donor referral in 2020 compared with 2018. No significant difference in the proportion of referrals from ICU or non-ICU areas between the 2 time periods was observed. The brain death confirmation rate was significantly higher in 2020 (40.8% vs 20.2%, P = .003). Nine patients had family consent for organ donation in 2020 (vs 7 patients in the same period in 2018). There were no significant differences in consent rate and number of recovered organs between the 2 periods.

120442,Racial disparities in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes.,2021-02-26,"Previous studies have shown that proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), are differentially induced in primary mouse astrocytes by mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) and MHV-2. However, the signaling events that trigger TNF-alpha and IL-6 induction in these cells upon MHV infection remain unknown. In this study, we explored the potential signaling events. We found that induction of TNF-alpha and IL-6 occurred as early as 2 h postinfection and was completely dependent on viral replication. Using inhibitors specific for three mitogen-activated protein kinases, we showed that induction of TNF-alpha and IL-6 by MHV-A59 infection was mediated through activation of the Janus N-terminal kinase signaling pathway, but not through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase or p38 signaling pathway. This finding was further confirmed with knockdown experiments using small interfering RNAs specific for Janus N-terminal kinase. Interestingly, while nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), a key transcription factor required for the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in most cell types, was activated in astrocytes during MHV-A59 infection, disruption of the NF-kappaB pathway by peptide inhibitors did not significantly inhibit TNF-alpha and IL-6 expression. Furthermore, experiments using chimeric viruses demonstrated that the viral spike and nucleocapsid proteins, which play important roles in MHV pathogenicity in mice, are not responsible for the differential induction of the cytokines. These results illustrate the complexity of the regulatory mechanism by which MHV induces proinflammatory cytokines in primary astrocytes.","Yu, Dongdong; Zhu, Hongqing; Liu, Yin; Cao, Jianzhong; Zhang, Xuming",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01103-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19776127/,209

The purpose of this study was to understand the spread of learning health systems in primary care, including where they have been implemented, how they are operating, and potential challenges and solutions. METHODS We completed a scoping review by systematically searching OVID Medline®, Embase®, IEEE Xplore®, and reviewing specific journals from 2007 to 2020. We also completed a Google search to identify gray literature. RESULTS We reviewed 1924 articles through our database search and 51 articles from other sources, from which we identified 21 unique learning health systems based on 62 data sources. Only one of these learning health systems was implemented exclusively in a primary care setting, where all others were integrated health systems or networks that also included other care settings. Eighteen of the 21 were in the United States. Examples of how these learning health systems were being used included real-time clinical surveillance, quality improvement initiatives, pragmatic trials at the point of care, and decision support. Many challenges and potential solutions were identified regarding data, sustainability, promoting a learning culture, prioritization processes, involvement of community, and balancing quality improvement versus research. CONCLUSIONS We identified 21 learning health systems, which all appear at an early stage of development, and only one was primary care only. We summarized and provided examples of integrated health systems and data networks that can be considered early models in the growing global movement to advance learning health systems in primary care.","Nash, Danielle M; Bhimani, Zohra; Rayner, Jennifer; Zwarenstein, Merrick",BMC family practice,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-021-01483-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34162336/,209
121572,A Postmortem Portrait of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: A Large Multiinstitutional Autopsy Survey Study.,2021-01-15,"The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by human transmission and infection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is no trusted drug against the virus; hence, efforts are on discovering novel inhibitors for the virus. The entry of a SARS-CoV-2 virus particle into a host cell is initiated by its spike glycoprotein and host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor interaction. Spike glycoprotein domains, namely, the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and Heptad Repeat (HR) domains, are essential for this activity. We have studied the impact of mutations such as A348T, N354D, D364Y, G476S, V483A, S494D in the RBD (319-591), and S939F, S940T, T941A, S943P (912-984) in the HR1 domains of spike glycoprotein. Summarily, we utilized the computational screening algorithms to rank the deleterious, damaging and disease-associated spike glycoprotein mutations. Subsequently, to understand the changes in conformation, flexibility and function of the spike glycoprotein mutants, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were performed. The computational predictions and analysis of the MD trajectories suggest that the RBD and HR1 mutations induce significant phenotypic effects on the pre-binding spike glycoprotein structure, which are presumably consequential to its binding to the receptor and provides lead to design inhibitors against the binding.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The Black Lives Matter movement is energized, issuing pleas to listen to Black voices regarding day-to-day discrimination and expressing frustrations over the slow progress of social justice. However, psychological scientists have published only several opinion pieces on racial microaggressions, primarily objections, and strikingly little empirical data. Here I document three trends in psychology that coincide with the academic pushback against microaggressions: concept-creep concerns, especially those regarding expanded notions of harm; the expansion of right-leaning values in moral judgments (moral foundations theory); and an emphasis on prejudice symmetry, with the political left deemed equivalently biased against right-leaning targets (e.g., the rich, police) as the right is against left-leaning targets (e.g., Black people, women, LGBT+ people). Psychological scientists have ignored power dynamics and have strayed from their mission to understand and combat prejudice against disadvantaged populations, rendering researchers distracted and ill-equipped to tackle the microaggression concept. An apparent creep paradox, with calls to both reduce (e.g., harm) and expand (e.g., liberal prejudices, conservative moral foundations) concepts, poses a serious challenge to research on prejudice.

In vitro and in silico inhibitory effects of the novel ureido-substituted sulfaguanidine derivatives ( 2a-f ) were investigated by spectrophotometric methods for α-glycosidase (α-GLY), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes associated with diabetes mellitus (DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). N-carbamimidoyl-4-(3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ureido) benzenesulfonamide ( 2f ) showed AChE and BChE inhibitory effects, with K I values of 515.98 ± 45.03 nM and 598.47 ± 59.18 nM, respectively, while N-carbamimidoyl-4-(3-(3-chlorophenyl)ureido) benzenesulfonamide ( 2e ) showed strong a-GLY inhibitory effect, with K I values of 103.94 ± 13.06 nM. The antidiabetic effects of the novel synthesized compounds ( 2a-f ) are higher than their anti-Alzheimer's effects, because the inhibition effect of the compounds on the α-GLY with diabetic enzyme is greater than the effect on esterase enzymes. Indeed, inhibition of the metabolic enzymes is important for the treatment of DM and AD.","Akocak, Suleyman; Taslimi, Parham; Lolak, Nebih; Işık, Mesut; Durgun, Mustafa; Budak, Yakup; Türkeş, Cüneyt; Gülçin, İlhami; Beydemir, Şükrü",Chemistry & biodiversity,https://doi.org/10.1002/cbdv.202000958; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33620128/,209
127934,Commentary: Lights and shadows of pediatric cardiac surgery in China during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.,2020-11-28,"BACKGROUND The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) is one of the targets identified in SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. The application of X-ray diffraction crystallography made available the three-dimensional structure of this protein target in complex with ligands, which paved the way for docking studies. OBJECTIVE Our goal here is to review recent efforts in the application of docking simulations to identify inhibitors of the Mpro using the program AutoDock4. METHOD We searched PubMed to identify studies that applied AutoDock4 for docking against this protein target. We used the structures available for Mpro to analyze intermolecular interactions and reviewed the methods used to search for inhibitors. RESULTS The application of docking against the structures available for the Mpro found ligands with an estimated inhibition in the nanomolar range. Such computational approaches focused on the crystal structures revealed potential inhibitors of Mpro that might exhibit pharmacological activity against SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, most of these studies lack the proper validation of the docking protocol. Also, they all ignored the potential use of machine learning to predict affinity. CONCLUSION The combination of structural data with computational approaches opened the possibility to accelerate the search for drugs to treat COVID-19. Several studies used AutoDock4 to search for inhibitors of Mpro. Most of them did not employ a validated docking protocol, which lends support to critics of their computational methodology. Furthermore, one of these studies reported the binding of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to Mpro. This study ignores the scientific evidence against the use of these antimalarial drugs to treat COVID-19.","de Azevedo Junior, Walter Filgueira; Bitencourt-Ferreira, Gabriela; Godoy, Joana Retzke; Adriano, Hilda Mayela Aran; Dos Santos Bezerra, Wallyson André; Dos Santos Soares, Alexandra Martins",Current medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.2174/0929867328666210329094111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33781188/,209

134515,Prevention of unplanned extubations in neonates through process standardization.,2016,"Streptococcus spp are opportunistic pathogens that normally reside in the upper respiratory, intestinal, lower urinary, and genital tracts but can cause localized infection or septicemia in dogs of all ages. A retrospective study of streptococcal infection in 393 dogs was conducted to identify the species of Streptococcus isolated, determine demographics of affected dogs, and characterize the disease processes associated with infection. The major streptococcal species isolated were S canis (88 cases, 22.4%), S dysgalactiae ssp equisimilis (13, 3.3%), and S equi ssp zooepidemicus (4, 1.0%). Sex was not a risk factor (P > .30). Fetuses and neonates were more likely to have streptococcal infection than were other age groups (P < .001). Streptococcal septicemia was considered an important cause of abortion and neonatal death and was isolated from all samples submitted for aerobic culture from dogs in that age group. There was a seasonal trend, with dogs more likely to have streptococcal infection in summer months. In dogs for which a disease process was identified, streptococcal infection was associated with dermatitis (29 dogs), pneumonia (24 dogs), adult septicemia (13 dogs), and fetal/neonatal septicemia leading to abortion or neonatal death (16 dogs). Identification of other clinically significant bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic organisms was common (267 of 393 dogs, 68%), especially in dogs with dermatitis or pneumonia. Infection with Streptococcus spp should be considered in the differential diagnosis in cases of abortion, septicemia, dermatitis, and pneumonia in dogs. Clinical significance of isolation of streptococcal organisms should be interpreted in context of clinical signs and pathologic findings.","Lamm, C G; Ferguson, A C; Lehenbauer, T W; Love, B C",Veterinary pathology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300985809359601; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20382824/,209

Authors' reply.,2020-08-27,"BACKGROUND There are no published data on the outcomes of inguinal hernia repair from the Anglophone Caribbean. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a series of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs from the region. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data was extracted from a prospectively maintained database of consecutive trans abdominal pre-peritoneal (TAPP) repairs done between June 1, 2005 and May 30, 2012. Perioperative data collected included patient demographics, hernia type, operative technique, duration of surgery, intra-operative details, morbidity, analgesia requirements, and duration of hospitalization. A telephone survey was also performed to identify late recurrences and complications. Descriptive statistics were generated using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Ver 12.0. RESULTS There were 103 consecutive TAPP procedures in 88 patients at an average age of 35.4 years ± 12.9 (standard deviation; SD) and average body mass index (BMI) of 28.9 Kg/m(2) ± 2.23 (SD). The indications were bilateral (30), recurrent unilateral (24), and primary unilateral (49) inguinal hernias. The mean duration of operation was 68.5 minutes (SD ± 10.4; Range: 55-95; Median 65; Mode 65) minutes for unilateral TAPP and 89 minutes (SD ± 7.61; Range: 80-105; Median 90; Mode 90) for bilateral repairs. Post-operatively, 65/70 patients required ≤1 dose of parenteral opioid analgesia and 74 (84.1%) patients discontinued oral analgesia within 48 hours of operation. Complications were recorded in six (5.8%) cases and a recurrence in one (0.97%) case after a mean follow-up period of 3.2 years (SD ± 1.8; Range: 0.5-7). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is a safe and effective operation in this setting.","Cawich, Shamir O; Mohanty, Sanjib K; Bonadie, Kimon O; Simpson, Lindberg K; Johnson, Peter B; Shah, Sundeep; Williams, Eric W",Journal of surgical technique and case report,https://doi.org/10.4103/2006-8808.118601; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24470844/,209

When present in the lumbar spine, they typically present with radiculopathy and weakness. CT imaging is helpful in assessing for bony involvement and temporal involvement while MRI imaging can be helpful in distinguishing hemangiomas from other mass lesions, however current reports on imaging features are limited. Diagnosis remains primarily dependent on tissue pathology with surgery as the mainstay of treatment. CASE PRESENTATION We present a unique case report in which we obtain additional DSA imaging to not only visualize the vascular anatomy associated with a L4-5 neuroforaminal capillary hemangioma involving the L4 nerve root and ganglion, but to also embolize the feeding artery prior to surgical resection. Patient initially underwent a CT-guided biopsy that was suspicious for a hemangioma and confirmed on final pathology to be the capillary subtype. DISCUSSION When diagnosed appropriately, patients avoid unnecessary additional testing and avoid erroneous treatment of this rare lesion. Based on our experience, we propose initial MRI imaging to characterize the hemangioma and evaluate for intradural involvement, DSA to assess vascularity followed by embolization of the lesion when able in order to minimize intra-operative hemorrhage risk, and ultimately surgery to achieve a gross total resection.","Peng, Sophia; McGuire, Laura S; Saman, Karimi; Valyi-Nagy, Tibor; Mehta, Ankit I",Spinal cord series and cases,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41394-021-00438-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400608/,209

The influence of AA dosing conditions on the rheological properties of the solutions in the concentration range above the crossover point was not revealed. In the case of RAFT synthesis, the rheological properties differ distinctively in the high concentration region that is expressed by unusual viscoelastic characteristics. Dilute solution viscometry revealed the influence of the comonomer loading order on the interaction intensity of the copolymer macromolecules with a solvent, which is more pronounced for samples synthesized by FRP and can be associated with the copolymers' molecular structure. Fiber spinning from solutions of polyacrylonitrile and its copolymers (PAN) synthesized by the RAFT method was not able to achieve a high degree of orientation drawing, while for polymers with a wider molecular weight distribution synthesized by FRP, it was possible to realize large stretches, which led to high-quality fibers with strength values up to 640 MPa and elongation at a break of 20%.","Skvortsov, Ivan Y; Chernikova, Elena V; Kulichikhin, Valery G; Varfolomeeva, Lydia A; Kuzin, Mikhail S; Toms, Roman V; Prokopov, Nikolay I",Materials,https://doi.org/10.3390/ma13163454; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764383/,209

DESIGN In two placebo-controlled studies, 279 patients were randomized to 1,800 mg G-GR and 270 to placebo with the evening meal; patients underwent a 2-week dose titration, followed by 8 weeks of stable dosing, and 1 week of dose tapering. Patients. Adults with PHN for ≥6 months and an average baseline Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) score of ≥4 were included in the study. OUTCOME MEASURES Percent change from baseline to week 10 in NPRS scores and the percentage of responders (defined as ≥30% reduction in NPRS scores from baseline to week 10) were determined. METHODS Patients randomized to G-GR were categorized at each week based on their percent pain reduction up to that week, and for each category, the percentage of week 10 responders was computed. For several early-improvement criteria, the percentage of week 10 responders, odds ratios for achieving week 10 treatment response, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. RESULTS There was a significant positive association between early pain reduction and week 10 treatment response. Pain reduction of <10% at week 5 of G-GR treatment was the best early predictor of lack of endpoint response, with only 8% of these patients moving on to become week 10 treatment responders. CONCLUSIONS Early response was a reliable predictor of final response. This approach holds promise for aiding clinicians in decision making regarding the need for alternative or supplemental treatment during G-GR therapy for PHN.","Jensen, Mark P; Hsu, Ping H; Vanhove, Geertrui F",Pain medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-4637.2012.01427.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22757655/,209

Selective breeding for the naturally occurring social immune trait ""hygienic behavior"" has emerged as one sustainable approach to reducing the mites' impact on honey bees. To expand our understanding of hygienic triggers and improve hygienic selection tools, we tested the hypothesis that the cuticular compounds (Z)-10-tritriacontene and (Z)-6-pentadecene, previously associated with unhealthy honey bee brood and/or brood targeted for hygiene, are triggers of honey bee hygienic behavior independent of brood health. In support of our hypothesis, application of synthetic (Z)-10-tritriacontene and (Z)-6-pentadecene onto brood and brood cell caps significantly increased hygienic behavior compared to application of similarly structured hydrocarbon controls (Z)-16-dotriacontene and (Z)-7-pentadecene. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant positive correlation between colony-level hygienic responses to (Z)-10-tritriacontene and the traditional freeze-killed brood assay for selection of hygienic honey bee stocks. These results confirm biological activity of (Z)-6-pentadecene and reveal (Z)-10-tritriacontene as a novel hygiene trigger. They also support development of improved tools for honey bee colony monitoring and hygienic selection, and thus may accelerate development of honey bee stocks with greater resistance to Varroa and associated pathogens.","Wagoner, Kaira M; Millar, Jocelyn G; Schal, Coby; Rueppell, Olav",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64144-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346037/,209

Recent studies demonstrated these impairments are related with fine and gross motor development, which are more strongly associated with cognition, and consequently language for individuals with ID than for without ID. Despite these studies, little is known about the structure and functioning of this population's spinal cord, which is highly involved in postural control. The aim of our study was to assess the latency of the reflex responses in postural muscles after unexpected lateral external perturbations, in individuals with intellectual disabilities compared to typically developed participants. We assessed 16 participants with intellectual disabilities, 9 males and 7 females (aged 24.06 ± 8.66 years) and 20 typical developed participants (CG), 11 females, 9 males, (aged 21.20±1.96 years). While the participants were in an upright standing position electromyography was used to collect data from M. obliquus externus abdominis (OE) muscles, which were activated by unpredictable perturbations applied by a servomotor on a hand-held grip, following the lateral external perturbation to the trunk. The intellectual disabilities group presented contralateral OE muscles latency of 85.71±27.24 ms, and CG group presented 68.62±10.25 ms, no differences was found. Ipsilateral OE muscles latency also did not differs between the groups, ID group showed 96.60±30.20 ms and CG group showed 95.57±33.53 ms.

The current challenge is to generate high-level clinical evidence for loco-regional treatments to define the benefits for patients. In this article, we argue that, to generate convincing evidence of clinical efficacy and safety, the collective coherence of the entire data package is often more important than the primary endpoint of one clinical trial. We also propose that, when a comprehensive clinical data package is not feasible, limited clinical data can be supplemented with other types of evidence. Emerging life science companies often define the ""valley of death"" after securing initial investment to translate an early medical device concept to a development stage that is attractive to funders. Unfortunately for this industry, there is a second ""valley of death"" if the focus and goal is only regulatory approval, to the neglect of clinical acceptance and reimbursement. For the emerging specialism of interventional oncology, it is critical to plan a clear line of sight for each new medical device to avoid the valleys of death and to demonstrate the clinical benefit.

OBJECTIVES To present the results of a systematic search performed on papers published from May 1st to May 31st, 2020. METHODS An extensive search on the main medical literature databases for articles published (including Epub), in English, from May 1st to May 31st, 2020 was performed, according to the methodology already described in the previous 2 rapid reviews, with 2 important improvements: first, we made the search string more comprehensive; second, we relied on accredited terminologies to describe the study designs and report the rehabilitation settings. RESULTS Fifty-eight out of 618 articles were finally included for qualitative analysis. The number of primary studies has increased, with respect to the previous months, although still around 60% papers are just expert opinions. Six papers report on the prevalence and /or characteristics of emerging disability after COVID-19, 12 on rehabilitation approaches to COVID-19 patients, up to 25 on the organization of rehabilitation services after COVID-19, 13 papers on the impact of COVID-19 on health conditions of rehabilitative interest and only 2 on late complications due to COVID-19 that may be of rehabilitative interest. CONCLUSIONS Nowadays, all patients with disability, regardless of COVID-19 infection, are suffering because of restrictions imposed to rehabilitation service delivery. Neurological involvement is often present during acute and post-acute stage, conveying the risk of a long-lasting disability. Accordingly, careful neurological monitoring should be granted. Although new therapies are under development, the main gap in the available scientific literature is the lack of high-quality primary studies, so experimental studies on the effects of rehabilitation are still warranted.","Andrenelli, Elisa; Negrini, Francesco; De Sire, Alessandro; Arienti, Chiara; Patrini, Michele; Negrini, Stefano; Ceravolo, Maria Gabriella",European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine,https://doi.org/10.23736/s1973-9087.20.06435-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32539312/,209

Follow-up occurred 2 weeks after hospital discharge, during which patients underwent a pulmonary function test. RESULTS Of the 137 patients who underwent a pulmonary function test 2 weeks after discharge, 51.8% were male, and the mean age was 47 years. Only 19.7% of the patients were identified as having severe COVID-19-induced pneumonia. The pulmonary function tests showed that for a small number of patients the forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity ratio (FEV1/FVC)/% values were <70%, and the mean forced inspiratory volume (IVC) and FVC values were 2.4±0.7 and 3.2±0.8 L, respectively. In severe cases, 88.9% of patients had an IVC <80% of the predicted value, and 55.6% of patients had an FVC <80% of the predicted value. The proportion of patients with maximum expiratory flow rate at 25%, 50% and 75% of the vital capacity (MEF25, MEF50, and MEF75) values <70% were 55.6%, 40.7%, and 25.9%, respectively. In the non-severe group, 79.1% of patients had an IVC <80% of the predicted value, and 16.4% of patients had an FVC <80% of the predicted value.

157134,Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in a French Cohort of Myasthenia Gravis.,2021-02-10,"For rapid response against the prevailing COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19), it is a global imperative to exploit the immunogenicity of existing formulations for safe and efficient vaccines. As the most accessible adjuvant, aluminum hydroxide (alum) is still the sole employed adjuvant in most countries. However, alum tends to attach on the membrane rather than entering the dendritic cells (DCs), leading to the absence of intracellular transfer and process of the antigens, and thus limits T-cell-mediated immunity. To address this, alum is packed on the squalene/water interphase is packed, forming an alum-stabilized Pickering emulsion (PAPE). ""Inheriting"" from alum and squalene, PAPE demonstrates a good biosafety profile. Intriguingly, with the dense array of alum on the oil/water interphase, PAPE not only adsorbs large quantities of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) antigens, but also harbors a higher affinity for DC uptake, which provokes the uptake and cross-presentation of the delivered antigens. Compared with alum-treated groups, more than six times higher antigen-specific antibody titer and three-fold more IFN-γ-secreting T cells are induced, indicating the potent humoral and cellular immune activations. Collectively, the data suggest that PAPE may provide potential insights toward a safe and efficient adjuvant platform for the enhanced COVID-19 vaccinations.","Peng, Sha; Cao, Fengqiang; Xia, Yufei; Gao, Xiao-Dong; Dai, Lianpan; Yan, Jinghua; Ma, Guanghui",Advanced materials,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202004210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32864794/,209

The feasibility of this model was evaluated. METHODS Laparoscopic CJ using intracorporeal sutures was performed on ten animals by a surgical fellow with no experience in human laparoscopic CJ. A single layer of running sutures was placed in the posterior and anterior layers. Jejunojejunostomy was performed using a linear stapler, and the jejunal opening was closed using absorbable unidirectional sutures (V-Loc 180). RESULTS The average operation time was 131.3 ± 36.4 minutes, and the CJ time was 57.5 ± 18.4 minutes. Both the operation time and CJ time showed a steady decrease with an increasing number of cases. The average diameter of the CBD was 6.4 ± 0.8 mm. Of a total of ten animals, eight were sacrificed after the procedure. In two animals, a survival model was evaluated. Both pigs recovered completely and survived for two weeks, after which both animals were sacrificed. None of the animals exhibited any signs of bile leakage or anastomosis site stricture. CONCLUSION The porcine training model introduced in this paper is an adequate model for practicing laparoscopic CJ. Human tissue simulation is excellent.","Lee, Jun Suh; Hong, Tae Ho",Annals of surgical treatment and research,https://doi.org/10.4174/astr.2015.88.6.306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26029675/,209
159023,Risk of Ischemic Stroke in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vs Patients With Influenza.,2020-07-02,"BACKGROUND Biologic mesh is widely used for repair of large, complicated hiatal hernias. Recently, there have been reports of complications after its implantation. We studied the course of a large group of patients who had undergone hiatal hernia repair with use of biologic mesh to determine the rate of immediate and late complications related to its use. METHODS All patients who had biologic mesh placed at the hiatus and who had been followed for at least 1 year were included. Perioperative data were reviewed, and a questionnaire was administered, designed to identify symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, other symptoms such as dysphagia, and all other operative or endoscopic interventions that occurred after mesh implantation. In addition, postoperative radiologic and endoscopic studies were reviewed to assess signs of complications related to use of mesh. RESULTS There were 126 patients eligible for the study. We were able to contact 73 of these patients, at median follow-up of 45 months. No mesh-related complications were found. The frequency and severity of heartburn, regurgitation, and dysphagia improved significantly compared with preoperative values, and 89% of the patients reported good to excellent results in terms of overall satisfaction. Six patients recorded worsening of dysphagia postoperatively, but after careful work-up and review of each individual case, no case seemed to be directly related to the mesh. No erosions, strictures, or other complications directly related to use of mesh were found. One patient required reoperation due to hiatal hernia recurrence with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Use of biologic mesh for laparoscopic repair of large, complicated hiatal hernias appears safe. There were no major complications related to the mesh, and overall satisfaction with the operation was very good.","Wassenaar, Eelco B; Mier, Fernando; Sinan, Huseyin; Petersen, Rebecca P; Martin, A Valeria; Pellegrini, Carlos A; Oelschlager, Brant K",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-2045-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22083339/,209

The Foundation for Ichthyosis and Related Skin Types (FIRST) Tele-Ichthyosis program has provided telemedicine for patients and their families with keratinizing disorders since 2009. This study aims to characterize a decade of experience with the program. METHODS This retrospective cohort study analyzed cases for demographics of patients and the clinicians who submitted their cases, nature of questions asked, number of expert responses, and characteristics of responses. Surveys were sent electronically to all users of the FIRST Tele-Ichthyosis service to assess experiences with the service and solicit constructive recommendations. Descriptive statistics were performed on the case review and responder surveys. RESULTS Eighty-eight geographically diverse cases were reviewed showing increased use over time by various specialists for patients of all ages. Sixty-six percent of cases were definitively ichthyosis, and most submitters queried on diagnosis (47%) or treatment (72%). Most submitters described the service as easy to use (66.6%) and advice as timely (61.1%), clear (66.6%), and beneficial (61.1%). All submitters made suggestions for improvement (100%). Experts predominately worked with pediatric populations (70%) and reported self-motivation to volunteer and improve patients' lives (100%). Experts found technological barriers minor and provided feedback to enhance the service. CONCLUSIONS This report highlights how a rare-disease patient advocacy group successfully supports physician collaboration and patient outcomes through secure and efficient telemedicine. Lessons learned are highly relevant in the current healthcare environment.","Asch, Sarah; Swink, Shane M; Vivar, Karina L; Pickford, Jean; Breuning, Lisa; Wassel, Christine; Hand, Jennifer L; Milstone, Leonard; Castelo-Soccio, Leslie",Pediatric dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/pde.14460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33230835/,209

Despite long-standing disparities in obesity across racial and ethnic groups and obesity's important role in COVID-19 disparities, there has been minimal attention to whether obesity itself could be a manifestation of systemic racism. Nor has there been serious policy attention dedicated to alleviating obesity and its disproportionate burden on BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color).

This is something that is imperative, and so this paper aims to provide advice on how organisations can keep their networks and systems safe from cyberattacks and opportunistic cybercriminals.Design/methodology/approachThis paper is a thought leadership piece and draws on Tata Consultancy Services (TCS’) COVID-19 Business Impact Survey, which surveys nearly 300 executives on how they are planning and managing the near and long-term impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. Those surveyed represented mostly large companies across 11 countries in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Moreover, 63% of these companies had an annual revenue of over $5bn.FindingsThe findings from the survey revealed that most organisations lack digital capabilities, and the coronavirus pandemic is exposing these weaknesses. It found that companies with essential digital capabilities (“leaders”) have held up better during the pandemic than those without (“followers). Moreover, the survey demonstrated that there is a significant lack of clarity on how to strategically move on multiple digital fronts cost-effectively.Originality/valueAs TCS is a global leader in information technology services, consulting and business solutions, this paper provides value to senior business and technology leaders in organisations that hold influence over the company’s security strategies.

Al respecto, se observa que a lo largo de la última década se ha visto un declive de la democracia, y aunque los efectos de la pandemia son todavía limitados, es de temerse que a largo plazo sus consecuencias sean peores que las que se perciben actualmente. Y dado que existe una evidente relación entre el carácter autocrático de los regímenes y la propensión a violentar los estándares democráticos con medidas exageradas o no consensuadas para combatir la pandemia, sería esperable un ahondamiento de la distancia entre países donde prevalece la democracia y en los que se dan formas autocráticas de ejercicio del poder.Alternate abstract:This essay looks at data that account for the impact of the pandemic on the conditions of democracy around the world.

There are lakhs of publications creating evidence about the management of the disease. After seeing thousands of cases, we formed opinions in each field of management and these findings may look more logical. We accept that our opinions differ subtly from the evidence. Regarding the transmission of the disease, it is spread from person to person through inhaled aerosols. If this is going to be 100% true, then the need for personal protective equipment covering the legs seems illogical. Povidone-iodine is antiviral and spreading the same as an ointment inside the nose must be effective to decrease viral load. The other antivirals with questionable efficiency like remdesivir are being used frequently, especially in the pulmonary phase. There are no clear-cut guidelines for primary contacts. Any protective drug intake could have decreased the transmission. It’s a simple logic that the act of sneezing will decrease the viral load. The practice of inhaling turmeric smoke to induce sneezing in the outdoor could have decreased the viral load. We opine that a lymphopenia of <15% can predict a worse outcome in the next 2 days. A computerized computed tomography scan of the chest is to be taken 7 days after the onset of symptoms as the disease usually enters the pulmonary phase only then. The date of onset of symptoms rather than the positive testing date should be considered for timeline management of the case. The undue tachycardia in the 1st week and desaturation below 92% in the 2nd week are the warning signs. The steroids are to be usually prescribed after the 5–6 days. The roles of psychiatric counseling and nutrition were largely underplayed.","Parthasarathy, S.; Sundararajan, M.; Manimaran, A.",Asian Journal of Pharmaceutical and Clinical Research,https://doi.org/10.22159/ajpcr.2021.v14i7.41754,209

As we arrive at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most squeezing questions confronting us is: what is the likely effect of the ongoing emergency on the digital economy development rate? The results have been shown first that the GDP growth for both years 2020 and 2021 is approximately 6% for the USA.

Study objectives are to develop a prediction model leveraging subsample of known Patient/Controls and evaluate the relationship of predicted mental health status to clinical outcome measures and pandemic-related psychological and behavioral responses during lockdown (spring/summer 2020). Methods: Online cohort study conducted by National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Research Program. Convenience sample of English speaking adults (enrolled 4/4 to 5/16/20; n=1,992). Enrollment measures: demographics, clinical history, functional status, psychiatric and family history, alcohol/drug use. Outcome measures (enrollment and q2 weeks/6 months): distress, loneliness, mental health symptoms, and COVID 19 survey. NIMH IRP Patient/Controls survey responses informed assignment of Patient Probability Scores (PPS) for all participants. Regression models analyzed the relationship between PPS and outcome measures. Outcomes: Mean age 46.0, female (82.4%), white (88.9 %). PPS correlated with distress, loneliness, depression, and mental health factors. PPS associated with negative psychological responses to COVID 19. Worry about mental health (OR 1.46) exceeded worry about physical health (OR 1.13). PPS not associated with adherence to social distancing guidelines but was with stress related to social distancing and worries about infection of self/others. Interpretation: Mental health status (PPS) was associated with concurrent clinical ratings and COVID 19 specific negative responses. A focus on mental health during the pandemic is warranted, especially among those with mental health vulnerabilities. We will include PPS when conducting longitudinal analyses of mental health trajectories and risk and resilience factors that may account for differing clinical outcomes.

For a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients with IRD and due to the high incidence of COVID-19 in Madrid from the beginning of this pandemic infection in Spain, the Society of Rheumatology from Madrid (SORCOM) established a registry (REUMA-COVID SORCOM) shortly after the beginning of the pandemic in Spain. Objectives: To determine factors associated with severity of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases in Madrid Methods: The REUMA-COVID SORCOM registry is a multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study conducted in Madrid, a SORCOM initiative. All rheumatology departments from Madrid were invited to participate. The study includes patients with IRD presenting with a confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and November 10, 2020. We consider severe infection death or need of hospitalization. Inclusion criteria was having an IRD and at least 1 of the following 4 criteria: (1) a biologically confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis based on a positive result of a SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on a nasopharyngeal swab;(2) Detection of IgM or IgG anti SARSCoV2 in a symptomatic or asymptomatic patients (3)typical thoracic computed tomography (CT) abnormalities (ground-glass opacities) in epidemic areas;(4) COVID19-typical symptoms in an epidemic zone of COVID-19. Results: As of November 10, 2020, 417 patients with IRD were included in the REUMA-COVID SORCOM registry. 5 patients were discharged for incomplete data. Of 412 patients (mean age 57 years, 87.4% Caucasian race, 66.3% female) 174 need hospitalization (42.2%) and 33 patients died (18.4% mortality in hospitalized patients). 82.3% had comorbidities. 234 (56.8%) patients were classified as inflammatory arthropathy, 133 (32.3%) had connective tissue diseases (CTD). 41.1% of the patients had a large history of IRD (≥ 10 years). 10.4% of patients had previously pulmonary involvement. The study includes 143 patients taking Methotrexate, 89 patients taking anti-TNFα therapy and 27 Rituximab. In the univariant analysis, no differences were seen in the severity of COVID-19 infection in patients taking methotrexate. 63% of the all patients taking Rituximab included in the registry need hospitalization and 22% of them died. Hypertension, COPD or cardiovascular disease was associated with hospitalization. Independent factors associated with COVID-19 hospitalization in the multivariate analysis was: age (≥62 years), male sex, IMC ≥30, previous cardiovascular comorbidities and the IRD disease duration (≥ 10 years). Independent factors associated with COVID-19 related death was: age (≥ 62 years), having a CTD diagnose, pulmonary involvement before infection and chronical GC treatment. Conclusion: Patients with IRD represent a population of particular interest in the pandemic context because the baseline immunological alteration and the treated with immunosuppressants agents they receive, comorbidities and the well-known risk of severe infection. Older age, male sex, cardiovascular comorbidities were factors associated with high risk of hospitalization in IRD patients. CTD diseases, previously pulmonary involvement and chronical GC treatment with more than 10mg/day were associated with high risk of death.

Long-term measurements of trace gas concentrations in urban areas can be used to quantify the impact of emission reductions on GHG mole fractions. Open-path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) spectroscopy is a non-intrusive technique that can be used to simultaneously measure multiple atmospheric trace gases in the boundary layer. This study investigates the reduction of mole fractions and mole fraction enhancements above background for surface CO, CO2, and CH4 in downtown Toronto, Canada (the fourth largest city in North America) during the 2020 and 2021 COVID-19 stay-at-home periods. Mean values obtained from these periods were compared with mean values from a reference period prior to the 2020 restrictions. Mean CO mole fraction enhancement declined by 51 ± 23% and 42 ± 24% during the 2020 and 2021 stay-at-home periods, respectively. The mean afternoon CO2 mole fraction enhancement declined by 3.9 ± 2.6 ppm (36 ± 24%) and 3.5 ± 2.8 ppm (33 ± 26%) during the stay-at-home periods in 2020 and 2021. In contrast, CH4 mole fraction enhancement did not show any significant decrease. Diurnal variation in CO during the stay-at-home period in 2020 was also significantly reduced relative to the reference period in 2020. These reductions in trace gas mole fraction enhancements coincide with the decline of local traffic during the stay-at-home periods, with an estimated reduction in CO and CO2 enhancements of 0.74 ± 0.15 ppb and 0.18 ± 0.05 ppm per percentage decrease in traffic, respectively.","You, Yuan Byrne Brendan Colebatch Orfeo Mittermeier Richard L.; Vogel, Felix Strong Kimberly",Atmosphere,https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos12070848,209

The activity of aminopeptidase in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was significantly higher in patients with sarcoidosis than in normal volunteers (NV) and control patients (CP). The activity significantly correlated with lymphocyte percentages and the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T lymphocytes in the BALF, and was higher in patients with sarcoidosis with parenchymal involvement than in those without the involvement. CD13/aminopeptidase N protein, which has a molecular mass of approximately 150 kD, was detectable in alveolar macrophages (AM) from patients with sarcoidosis at higher levels than in those from NV.

The chemotactic activity was greater for CD4+ T lymphocytes than for CD8+ T lymphocytes. The enzymatic activity of CD13/aminopeptidase N was responsible for the chemotactic activity because bestatin, an inhibitor of CD13/aminopeptidase N, abolished the chemotactic activity. Higher chemotactic activity for lymphocytes was detected in the BALF from patients with sarcoidosis than in that from NV, and the activity was significantly decreased by treatment with bestatin. This study indicates that CD13/ aminopeptidase N expressed in AM may have a role in T-lymphocyte involvement in the sarcoid lung and the pathogenesis of alveolitis in this disorder.","Tani, K; Ogushi, F; Huang, L; Kawano, T; Tada, H; Hariguchi, N; Sone, S",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10806168/,209
196090,Optimal Management of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in Adult Patients During the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic.,2020-05-01,"With constantly evolving materials and techniques used in wound closure management for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), it is imperative that we continuously evaluate new modalities and techniques to optimize healing. This article provides a concise review of the current closure and wound management methods for each of the following three layers and dressing: 1) deep fascia layer, or arthrotomy; 2) subdermal layer or subcutaneous layer; 3) skin and subcuticular layer; and 4) dressing application. By introducing a comprehensive and systematic approach to TKA wounds, this report also incorporates newer modalities such as barbed sutures and adhesive dressings, which have increasingly replaced traditional suture and staple methods. Furthermore, we examine how various layers of modern wound closure compare to conventional methods while discussing both the clinical and economic impacts of each. Newer wound management methods, such as the adhesive and occlusive dressings with varying monofilament subcuticular sutures, can eliminate the need for staple and suture removal, increase the value of care provided, limit unnecessary postoperative visits, and potentially address wound issues by communicating safely with patients via telemedicine, an ever-relevant discussion in the era of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Tarazi, John M; Naylor, Brandon H; Salem, Hytham S; Mont, Michael A",Surgical technology international,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32715448/,209

We recorded the baseline demographic profile, baseline clinical and laboratory parameters, and prevalence of various co-morbidities and their effect on the prognosis of COVID-19 cases. We conducted a prospective observational study and analyzed baseline clinical and laboratory parameters and co-morbidities and their effect on severity and mortality in 710 COVID-19 cases. Seven hundred ten patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were recruited from the 28th of March to the 31st of August 2020. The mean age was 48.4 ± 16.4years. A total of 530 (74.6%) patients were male. Overall, the mean length of hospital stay was 12.7 days. In total, 645 patients(90.8%) were mild to moderate cases and did not require initial ICU care. Sixty-five (9.2%) cases required initial intensive care unit care. Fifty (7%) admitted patients succumbed to the illness. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension increased the risk of death in COVID-19 patients irrespective of age. Increasing age and co-morbidities adversely affect the prognosis of patients of COVID-19. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension increase the risk of death in COVID-19 patients and negate the incremental effect of age on death in these patients.","Gupta, Anirban; Nayan, Neelabh; Nair, Ranjith; Kumar, Krishna; Joshi, Aditya; Sharma, Shivangi; Singh, Jasdeep; Kapoor, Rajan",SN Compr Clin Med,,209

Replication/transcription machinery of this virus consists of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12 or RdRp) and its two cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 proteins. Hence, RdRp has emerged as a promising target to control COVID-19. In the present study, we are reporting a novel inhibitor VTRM1.1 against the RdRp protein of SARS CoV2. A series of antivirals were tested for binding to the catalytic residues of the active site of RdRp protein. In-silico screening, molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) analysis suggest ribavirin, and remdesivir have good interaction with the binding site of the RdRp protein as compared to other antiviral investigated. Hence, ribavirin and remdesivir were used for the denovo fragments based antiviral design. This design, along with docking and MDS analysis, identified a novel inhibitor VTRM1 that has better interaction with RdRp as compared to their parent molecules. Further, to produce a lead-like compound, retrosynthetic analysis, and combinatorial synthesis were performed, which produces 1000 analogs of VTRM1. These analogs were analysed by docking and MDS analysis that identified VTRM1.1 as a possible lead to inhibit RdRp protein. This lead has a good docking score, favourable binding energy and bind at catalytic residues of the active site of RdRp. The VTRM1.1 also interacts with RdRp in the presence of RNA primer and other cofactors. It was also seen that, VTRM1.1 do not have off-target in human. Therefore, the present study suggests a hybrid inhibitor VTRM1.1 for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS CoV2 that may be useful to control infection caused by COVID-19.","Tiwari, Vishvanath",Int J Biol Macromol,,209

These criteria are sensitive but not specific, and can potentially lead to over-triage and ""unnecessary"" clinic visits. We are a Level 1 trauma centre with burn subspecialty care, and due to the COVID-19 pandemic, referrals to our multidisciplinary outpatient burn clinic required triaging for virtual care appointments. In order to improve the triage process, we retrospectively reviewed our outpatient burn clinic referrals over a 2-year period 2018-2019, for adherence to American Burn Association criteria. We collected data pertaining to patient and burn characteristics, as well as treatment outcome, to characterize referrals not requiring an in-person appointment. Of the 244 patients referred, 73% met the referral criteria, with 45% of these patients being healed at first visit and 14.6% requiring surgical management. Mean time from injury to first visit was 9.7 days (mode 6), and average number of visits was 2. Overall, mean burn size was 2%, with the majority of injuries being partial thickness (71%), located in the hand or extremity (77%). There was fairly equal distribution of contact (36%), flame (21%), and scald (26%) burns. This study highlights the non-specific nature of the American Burn Association referral criteria. We found that paediatric and hand burns in particular were over-triaged and lead to ""unnecessary"" appointments.

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named COVID-19 and was soon declared as pandemic because of the millions of infections and thousands of deaths worldwide. Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 usually develop asymptomatic or mild disease compared to adults. They are also more likely to have atypical and non-specific clinical manifestations than adults. METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed and Scopus to summarize the extrapulmonary manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children since the beginning of the pandemic. Peer-reviewed papers in English were retrieved using the following keywords and combinations: 'pediatric', 'child', 'infant', 'neonate', 'novel coronavirus', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'COVID 19' and 'gastrointestinal', 'renal', 'cardiac', 'dermatologic' or 'ophthalmologic'. We included published case series and case reports providing clinical symptoms and signs in SARS-CoV2 pediatric patients. RESULTS: Although fever and symptoms of upper respiratory infection are the most frequently presented, a variety of other atypical presentations has also been reported. The clinical spectrum includes dermatological, ophthalmological, neurological, cardiovascular, renal, reproductive, and gastrointestinal presentations. In addition, a rare multi-inflammatory syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported in children, often leading to shock requiring inotropic support and mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians need to be aware of the wider range of extrapulmonary atypical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, so that appropriate testing, treatment, and public health measures can be implemented rapidly.","Benou, Sofia; Ladhani, Shamez; Dimitriou, Gabriel; Gkentzi, Despoina",Current pediatric reviews (Online),,209

Based on these findings, we have undertaken in silico molecular docking study to demonstrate, for the first time, the principle for the potential evidence pointing ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin ability to interact with COVID-19 Main Protease. METHODS: In silico molecular docking and molecular dynamics techniques were applied to assess the potential for ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin interaction with COVID-19 Main Protease (Mpro). Chloroquine and nelfinavir were used as positive controls. RESULTS: We revealed that the tested antibiotics exert strong capacity for binding to COVID-19 Main Protease (Mpro). According to the results obtained from the GOLD docking program, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin bind to the protein active site more strongly than the native ligand. When comparing with positive controls, a detailed analysis of the ligand-protein interactions shows that the tested fluoroquinolones exert a greater number of protein interactions than chloroquine and nelfinavir. Moreover, lower binding energy values obtained from KDEEP program were stated when compared to nelfinavir.

One of the unique features of this virus, known as COVID coagulopathy, has been associated with bleeding and/or clotting diathesis in the setting of a prothrombotic state. This has put patients at risk for hemorrhagic complications such as frank disseminated intravascular coagulation, and antiphospholipid syndrome activation. This is a case of hemothorax as a rare complication of COVID-19 infection. Case Presentation This is the case of a 48 year old male with a history of ESRD requiring dialysis, who presented to our facility with shortness of breath. He was recently admitted a month prior to an outside facility for a dialysis catheter infection and was found to be COVID-19 positive. He received IV antibiotics and supplemental oxygen. He was discharged home with plans for IV antibiotics. He presented to our facility with five days of shortness of breath. In the ED he was afebrile, tachypneic and tested negative for COVID-19. Computed Tomography of the chest was significant for a moderate to large right pleural effusion with loculated components. The next day he underwent a thoracentesis and 600 cc of bloody pleural fluid was aspirated. He then underwent a VATS, decortication, pleurodesis a few days later as the effusion failed to resolve. Cytology of the initial thoracentesis was negative for malignant cells and pathology from the VATS was positive for fibrosis, hemorrhage with fibrin deposition and acute and chronic inflammation. Discussion Hemothorax as a complication of COVID -19 has yet to be described in the literature. Altered markers such as D-dimer and fibrinogen were associated with increased coagulation and thrombotic complications respectively. Furthermore, studies have reported intra-alveolar hemorrhages and GI bleeding in post-mortem analysis of COVID patients. This case highlights the uniqueness of this novel virus and the vast array of complications that can result from infection.","Muzaffarr, Z.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,209

METHODS: A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Embase and Web of Sciences, and twenty-two studies were selected from the literature search. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were estimated by either fixed- or random-effects models. RESULTS: Four outcomes were evaluated: (a) haemoglobin decline: significant associations with haemoglobin decline were found for rs1127354 CC VS CA + AA (OR = 10.59, 95% CI = 6.39-17.54); (b) severe anaemia: significant association with severe anaemia was observed for rs1127354 CC VS CA + AA (OR = 16.24, 95% CI = 6.21-42.43); (c) sustained virological response (SVR): CC genotype carriers had a decrease SVR during treatment (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.52-0.81); (d) RBV dose reduction or stopping treatment: although statistical evidence of an association was found between the polymorphism and RBV dose reduction during treatment (OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.03-3.13), the sensitivity analysis suggested this result was not robust.

Google Trends (GT) depicts the public interest of the community which may vary due to evolving policy dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. Aim: The aim was to study global public interest in Yoga for mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Methods: Global time trends were obtained for Yoga, Anxiety, and Depression from November 1, 2019 to May 31, 2020 using GT. The time series analysis was done in three different time periods – pre-COVID-19 phase, transition period, and COVID-19 pandemic phase. Cross-correlation, Spearman rho, Friedman ANOVA test, and forecasting were used for analysis. Results: GT found a global change in the search queries for Yoga, anxiety, and depression during the three time periods. High burden COVID-19 countries – Italy, Spain, Russia, and Brazil had an increasing search trend for Yoga. During the COVID-19 phase, there was a significant positive correlation between the search trends of Yoga with depression (r = 0.232;P &lt; 0.05) and anxiety (r = 0.351;P &lt; 0.05), but higher anxiety and depression searches lead to lower Yoga searches at lag +6. Forecast projected a continuous increase in Yoga searches and anxiety queries. Conclusion: Google Trends captured a significant rise in interest of Yoga among the global community but diminished with time.

Here, we provide a living systematic review to capture information that might necessitate changes in the guidance on breast milk and breastfeeding given the uncertainty in this area. Our search retrieved 19,414 total records; 605 were considered for full-text eligibility and no ongoing trials were identified. Our review includes 340 records, 37 with breast milk samples and 303 without. The 37 articles with analyzed breast milk samples reported on 77 mothers who were breastfeeding their children; among them, 19 of 77 children were confirmed COVID-19 cases based on RT-PCR assays, including 14 neonates and five older infants. Nine of the 68 analyzed breast milk samples from mothers with COVID-19 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA; of the exposed infants, four were positive and two were negative for COVID-19. Currently, there is no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through breast milk. Studies are needed with longer follow-up periods that collect data on infant feeding practices and on viral presence in breast milk.","Centeno-Tablante, Elizabeth; Medina-Rivera, Melisa; Finkelstein, Julia L; Rayco-Solon, Pura; Garcia-Casal, Maria Nieves; Rogers, Lisa; Ghezzi-Kopel, Kate; Ridwan, Pratiwi; Peña-Rosas, Juan Pablo; Mehta, Saurabh",Ann.

Under these circumstances, immunochromatography may serve as an alternative method to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies that can demonstrate a history of infection. In patients with severe COVID-19 infection, 14 of 19 serum samples were shown to be positive, whereas 6 of 10 samples from patients with asymptomatic or mild cases were negative for IgG antibodies. Two patients with immune thrombocytopenia, who were treated with prednisolone, experienced aggressive behavior of COVID-19-related respiratory failure and eventually died. Patients who were before an achievement of remission and those who received steroid-based chemotherapy possessed a higher risk of death, and more deaths were observed in patients with lymphoid malignancies including lymphoma and myeloma compared with those with myeloid malignancies. As for daily medical care in hematological department, a stricter cohorting strategy using repeat PCR tests or isolation to a private room should be adopted in order to prevent viral spread to the environment.","Hagihara, Masao; Ohara, Shin; Uchida, Tomoyuki; Inoue, Morihiro",Rinsho Ketsueki,,209

Sus síntomas incluyen fiebre, tos seca y dificultad respiratoria. Estos síntomas en general son leves, aunque, pueden ser fatales en adultos mayores y pacientes con comorbilidades. Se realizó búsqueda bibliográfica en Pubmed y Clinical Key donde se seleccionaron 22 artículos de acuerdo con los criterios de inclusión. SARS-CoV-2 pertenece al género de los Betacoronavirus y tiene similitudes genómicas con SARS-CoV y MERS-CoV. El virión de SARS-CoV-2 consta de una nucleocápside y de una envoltura externa compuesta por proteínas estructurales principales y accesorias. Su material genético consiste en una cadena de RNA monocatenario de polaridad positiva, en el que, se codifican proteínas importantes para su transcripción y replicación. El mecanismo de infección de SARS-CoV-2 comienza con la unión del virión a un receptor (ACE2) de la célula huésped y su posterior entrada por endocitosis. El genoma RNA viral se libera al citoplasma donde se transcriben y se traducen las proteínas necesarias para la producción de las proteínas estructurales y para la replicación de su material genético. Posteriormente, el RNA replicado se asocia con la nucleocápside y se ensambla junto con las proteínas estructurales para conformar las partículas víricas que serán liberadas de la célula infectada. El sistema inmune hace frente a la infección viral mediante el reconocimiento de patrones moleculares asociados a patógenos (PAMPs) por parte de la inmunidad innata y por la acción de los linfocitos T y B por parte de la inmunidad humoral. El conocimiento de las bases genéticas y moleculares de SARS-CoV-2 permite visualizar la posibilidad de establecer tratamientos farmacológicos o desarrollo de vacunas para controlar y disminuir los efectos patogénicos de la enfermedad.","Pastrian-Soto, Gabriel",Int. j. odontostomatol.

The pandemic affects both individuals and the broader society across many domains, including physical and psychological health, the economy and general welfare. The measures taken to counteract the pandemic have significantly altered daily life and, along with the threat of contracting the coronavirus and uncertainties surrounding future developments, created a complex system of stressors with a negative impact on public mental health. This paper aims to outline the ESTSS strategy to address mental health issues related to COVID-19 and focuses on (1) trauma-informed policies, (2) capacity building, (3) collaborative research and (4) knowledge-exchange. To facilitate implementation of a trauma-informed approach and appropriate measures, ESTSS has developed a toolkit of recommendations on mental health and psychosocial assistance to be provided during the different phases of crisis and its aftermath. To promote capacity building, ESTSS offers a certification programme based on a curriculum in psychotraumatology and corresponding on-line training to the European community of mental health professionals. To assure evidence-based approaches and methods tailored to current circumstances, ESTSS has initiated a pan-European research project with international cooperation aimed at studying the mental health consequences of the pandemic, with a focus on psychological trauma and other stress-related reactions. To foster knowledge-exchange, the European Journal of Psychotraumatology (EJPT), the official journal of ESTSS, is publishing a special issue on COVID-19.","Javakhishvili, Jana Darejan; Ardino, Vittoria; Bragesjö, Maria; Kazlauskas, Evaldas; Olff, Miranda; Schäfer, Ingo",Eur.

The objective of this study was to examine the perception of medical services by cancer patients during the pandemic and to identify the key elements influencing the level of satisfaction with oncological care. Of note, 394 patients diagnosed with cancer treated in inpatient oncology wards participated in the study (Poland). The diagnostic survey method was used. A survey questionnaire developed by the authors was used and validated the EORTC IN-PATSAT32 questionnaire. The calculations were made in Statistica 10.0 (Statsoft; 2011, Dell Inc., Round Rock, TX, USA). The average general level of satisfaction with oncological care in the study group was 80.77 out of a total score of 100, representing the highest level of satisfaction. Levels of satisfaction varied according to time since diagnosis (longer time-greater satisfaction) and were lower where treatment was delayed or perceived as disorganised. Nearly half of the respondents felt the threat of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, despite the fact that most of them believed that the hospital was well prepared to diagnose and treat cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Convincing patients about the proper preparation of health care for diagnostics and therapy is an important element influencing patient satisfaction with oncological care.","Konieczny, Magdalena; Cipora, Elzbieta; Sawicka, Jolanta; Fal, Andrzej",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,209

METHODS: From Dec 31, 2019, to Apr 5, 2020, a total of 132 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients with diabetes from two hospitals were retrospectively included in our study. Clinical, laboratory and chest CT data were analyzed and compared between the two groups with an admission glucose level of &#8804;11 mmol/L (group 1) and >11 mmol/L (group 2). Logistic regression analyses were used to identify the risk factors associated with in-hospital death and complications. RESULTS: Of 132 patients, 15 died in hospital and 113 were discharged. Patients in group 2 were more likely to require intensive care unit care (21.4% vs. 9.2%), to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (23.2% vs. 9.2%) and acute cardiac injury (12.5% vs. 1.3%), and had a higher death rate (19.6% vs. 5.3%) than group 1. In the multivariable analysis, patients with admission glucose of >11 mmol/l had an increased risk of death (OR: 7.629, 95%CI: 1.391-37.984) and in-hospital complications (OR: 3.232, 95%CI: 1.393-7.498).

CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 patients with diabetes, poorly-controlled blood glucose (>11 mmol/L) may be associated with poor outcomes. Admission hyperglycemia, elevated d-dimer and high HRCT score are potential risk factors for adverse outcomes and death.","Li, Yumin; Han, Xiaoyu; Alwalid, Osamah; Cui, Yue; Cao, Yukun; Liu, Jia; Gu, Jin; Wang, Lixia; Fan, Yanqing; Shi, Heshui",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,209

On comparison with solid tumors (98%), a significantly lower rate of seroconversion was observed in patients with hematologic malignancies (85%), particularly recipients following highly immunosuppressive therapies such as anti-CD20 therapies (70%) and stem cell transplantation (73%). Patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (97%) or hormonal therapies (100%) demonstrated high seroconversion post vaccination. Patients with prior COVID-19 infection demonstrated higher anti-spike IgG titers post vaccination. Relatively lower IgG titers were observed following vaccination with the adenoviral than with mRNA-based vaccines. These data demonstrate generally high immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination in oncology patients and identify immunosuppressed cohorts that need novel vaccination or passive immunization strategies.","Thakkar, Astha; Gonzalez-Lugo, Jesus D; Goradia, Niyati; Gali, Radhika; Shapiro, Lauren C; Pradhan, Kith; Rahman, Shafia; Kim, So Yeon; Ko, Brian; Sica, R Alejandro; Kornblum, Noah; Bachier-Rodriguez, Lizamarie; McCort, Margaret; Goel, Sanjay; Perez-Soler, Roman; Packer, Stuart; Sparano, Joseph; Gartrell, Benjamin; Makower, Della; Goldstein, Yitz D; Wolgast, Lucia; Verma, Amit; Halmos, Balazs",Cancer cell,,209

Cardiac injury after SARS-CoV-2 infection is a major concern. The present study investigated impact of the biomarkers indicating cardiac injury in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on patients' outcomes. METHODS: This study enrolled patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19 and admitted at a tertiary university referral hospital between February 19, 2020 and March 15, 2020. Cardiac injury was defined as an abnormality in one of the following result markers: 1) myocardial damage marker (creatine kinase-MB or troponin-I), 2) heart failure marker (N-terminal-pro B-type natriuretic peptide), and 3) electrical abnormality marker (electrocardiography). The relationship between each cardiac injury marker and mortality was evaluated. Survival analysis of mortality according to the scoring by numbers of cardiac injury markers was also performed. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Twenty-two patients (57.9%) had at least one of cardiac injury markers. The patients with cardiac injuries were older (69.6 ± 14.9 vs. 58.6 ± 13.9 years old, P = 0.026), and were more male (59.1% vs. 18.8%, P = 0.013). They showed lower initial oxygen saturation (92.8 vs. 97.1%, P = 0.002) and a trend toward higher mortality (27.3 vs. 6.3%, P = 0.099). The increased number of cardiac injury markers was significantly related to a higher incidence of in-hospital mortality which was also evidenced by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: The increased number of cardiac injury markers is related to in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19.","Kim, In Cheol; Song, Jin Eun; Lee, Hee Jung; Park, Jeong Ho; Hyun, Miri; Lee, Ji Yeon; Kim, Hyun Ah; Kwon, Yong Shik; Park, Jae Seok; Youn, Jong Chan; Hwang, Jongmin; Lee, Cheol Hyun; Cho, Yun Kyeong; Park, Hyoung Seob; Yoon, Hyuck Jun; Nam, Chang Wook; Han, Seongwook; Hur, Seung Ho; Eisen, Howard J; Kim, Hyungseop",J Korean Med Sci,,209
226946,Managing Lung Cancer during Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2021,"Objectives The wide spectrum of clinical outcomes to SARSCoV-2 exposure suggests that early immune responses play a pivotal role 1 We aim to describe early, longitudinal, local (nasal mucosal lining fluid) and systemic (peripheral blood) cytokine and cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a symptomatic index case and their household contacts with detailed clinical and virological phenotyping We hypothesise that immune responses at symptom onset would correlate with outcomes Methods Participants from the London area are referred to INSTINCT study by general practitioners as suspected, or Public Health England as laboratory-confirmed, cases (ethical review details: IRAS 282820, approved 24 04 2020) Households are visited the day after identification and again on days 7, 15 and 28 Clinical and exposure questionnaires, samples of environment (surface swabs and air);oropharynx (swabs);nasal mucosa (synthetic absorptive matrix) and blood, and daily symptom diaries are collected Samples are analysed by PCR, serology, 20-plex cytokine assay and flow cytometry in institutional laboratories Results The index case was the first SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive recruit of INSTINCT, confirmed on oropharyngeal swab 5 days after symptom onset Contacts 1 and 2, the spouse and daughter, became symptomatic 2 days after the index case and were confirmed PCR-positive 3 days after symptom onset The three PCR-positive individuals seroconverted during follow-up Contact 3, the son, remained asymptomatic, PCRand serology-negative throughout (figure 1a-b) None required hospitalisation Swabs of the kettle and fridge handles were positive for virus, while other household surfaces and air samples were negative Induction, peak and decline of interferonl-1 and IP-10 levels were captured in nasal mucosa, with lower serum levels (figures 1c-f) Conclusion These data demonstrate the ability of the INSTINCT household contact study to capture early immune responses in mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, not captured by COVID-19 hospital cohort studies Early nasal mucosal cytokine responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection are not reflected in serum The correlations observed provide cogent hypotheses that will be tested in the larger INSTINCT cohort, with implications for COVID-19 risk stratification, therapeutics, prophylaxis and vaccinology","Pillay, T.

In the present study, we investigated such cell-cell interaction between mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and cerebral endothelial cells. In contrast to BM-MNC, for MSC we observed suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor uptake into endothelial cells and transfer of glucose from endothelial cells to MSC in vitro. The transfer of such a small molecule from MSC to vascular endothelium was subsequently confirmed in vivo and was followed by suppressed activation of macrophage/microglia in stroke mice. The suppressive effect was absent by blockade of gap junction at MSC. Furthermore, gap junction-mediated cell-cell interaction was observed between circulating white blood cells and MSC. Our findings indicate that gap junction-mediated cell-cell interaction is one of the major pathways for MSC-mediated suppression of inflammation in the brain following stroke and provides a novel strategy to maintain the blood-brain barrier in injured brain. Furthermore, our current results have the potential to provide a novel insight for other ongoing clinical trials that make use of MSC transplantation aiming to suppress excess inflammation, as well as other diseases such as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019).","Kikuchi-Taura, Akie; Okinaka, Yuka; Saino, Orie; Takeuchi, Yukiko; Ogawa, Yuko; Kimura, Takafumi; Gul, Sheraz; Claussen, Carsten; Boltze, Johannes; Taguchi, Akihiko",Stem cells (Dayt.),,209

We aimed to confirm the incidence of perioperative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and associated mortality after surgery. METHODS: Analysis of routine electronic health record data from NHS hospitals in England. We extracted data from Hospital Episode Statistics in England describing adult patients undergoing surgery between January 1, 2020 and February 28, 2021. The exposure was SARS-CoV-2 infection defined by International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes. The primary outcome measure was 90 day in-hospital mortality. Data were analysed using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Index of Multiple Deprivation, presence of cancer, surgical procedure type and admission acuity. Results are presented as n (%) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: We identified 2 666 978 patients undergoing surgery of whom 28 777 (1.1%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection. In total, 26 364 (1.0%) patients died in hospital. SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a much greater risk of death (SARS-CoV-2: 6153/28 777 [21.4%] vs no SARS-CoV-2: 20 211/2 638 201 [0.8%]; OR=5.7 [95% CI, 5.5-5.9]; P<0.001). Amongst patients undergoing elective surgery, 2412/1 857 586 (0.1%) had SARS-CoV-2, of whom 172/2412 (7.1%) died, compared with 1414/1 857 586 (0.1%) patients without SARS-CoV-2 (OR=25.8 [95% CI, 21.7-30.9]; P<0.001). Amongst patients undergoing emergency surgery, 22 918/582 292 (3.9%) patients had SARS-CoV-2, of whom 5752/22 918 (25.1%) died, compared with 18 060/559 374 (3.4%) patients without SARS-CoV-2 (OR=5.5 [95% CI, 5.3-5.7]; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHS surgical pathways suggests current infection prevention and control policies are highly effective. However, the high mortality amongst patients with SARS-CoV-2 suggests these precautions cannot be safely relaxed.","Abbott, T E F; Fowler, A J; Dobbs, T D; Gibson, J; Shahid, T; Dias, P; Akbari, A; Whitaker, I S; Pearse, R M",Br J Anaesth,,209

Ageing is associated with progressive changes in muscle metabolism and a decline in functional capacity, leading to a loss of independence. Muscle metabolic changes associated with ageing have been linked to alterations in muscle architecture and declines in muscle mass and insulin sensitivity. However, the biological features often attributed to muscle ageing are also seen in controlled studies of physical inactivity (e.g. reduced step-count and bed-rest), and it is currently unclear how many of these ageing features are due to ageing per se or sedentarism. This is particularly relevant at a time of home confinements reducing physical activity levels during the Covid-19 pandemic. Current knowledge gaps include the relative contribution that physical inactivity plays in the development of many of the negative features associated with muscle decline in older age. Similarly, data demonstrating positive effects of government recommended physical activity guidelines on muscle health are largely non-existent. It is imperative therefore that research examining interactions between ageing, physical activity and muscle mass and metabolic health is prioritised so that it can inform on the ""normal"" muscle ageing process and on strategies for improving health span and well-being. This review will focus on important changes in muscle architecture and metabolism that accompany ageing and highlight the likely contribution of physical inactivity to these changes.","Shur, N F; Creedon, L; Skirrow, S; Atherton, P J; MacDonald, I A; Lund, J; Greenhaff, P L",Ageing Res Rev,,209

We demonstrated that the collection system had the capture efficiency of 99% and the capacity to capture representative nonvolatile molecules. The collection system was further evaluated using human subjects and proteins collected from human exhaled breath were characterized and identified using gel electrophoresis and bottom-up proteomics. The identified 303 proteins from mass spectrometry were further searched against reported bronchoalveolar lavage fluid proteomes and it was shown that 60 proteins have the tissue origin of lower respiratory airways.

As a result, patients with positive fecal immunochemical test (FIT) results that had already beenreturned, experienced delays in time to colonoscopy. The standard lead time in BowelScreen is 20 working days. The aim ofthis study was to examine the impact of this delay on time to colonoscopy for index FIT positive cases in two tertiaryendoscopy units. Methods Index cases affected by the pause which were subsequently completed (up to July 2020) were analyzed andcompared to the same period in 2019. All colonoscopy's were performed by a BowelScreen accredited consultantendoscopist. Endoscopy and histology data was obtained from the BowelScreen database and patient records. Results In total, 111 colonoscopies were performed during the study period. During the same period in 2019, 226 indexcolonoscopies were completed. The median lead time in 2020 was 38 working days, or almost double the recommendedlead time. The median age in 2020 was 66.5 years (IQR 60-70) and in 2019 63 years (IQR 60-70). Men accounted for 55 %of patients in 2020 and 66 % in 2019. A total of 191 polyps were detected in the 2020 group, 16 % of which were advanced adenomas (adenoma ≥ 10mm). There were 394 polyps identified in the 2019 group, 16 % of which were advancedadenomas. The majority of these advanced adenomas (77 % in 2020 and 90 % in 2019) were left sided. High gradedysplasia was detected in one polyp in 2020 and in five in 2019. There were 3 cancers detected in 2020 and 11 in 2019.

METHODS: Using anonymized, routinely collected, health care data in Wales, UK, we performed a retrospective matched cohort study (2003-2017) of adults with epilepsy prescribed an antiepileptic drug. Controls were matched with replacement on age, gender, deprivation quintile, and year of entry into the study. Participants were followed to the end of the study for the occurrence of a major cardiovascular event, and survival models were constructed to compare the time to a major cardiovascular event (cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, stroke, ischemic heart disease, clinically significant arrhythmia, thromboembolism, onset of heart failure, or a cardiovascular death) for individuals in the case group versus the control group. RESULTS: There were 10 241 cases (mean age = 49.6 years, 52.2% male, mean follow-up = 6.1 years) matched to 35 145 controls. A total of 3180 (31.1%) cases received enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs, and 7061 (68.9%) received non-enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs. Cases had an increased risk of experiencing a major cardiovascular event compared to controls (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.51-1.63, p < .001). There was no notable difference in major cardiovascular events between those treated with enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs and those treated with non-enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (adjusted hazard ratio = .95, 95% CI = .86-1.05, p = .300). SIGNIFICANCE: Individuals with epilepsy prescribed antiepileptic drugs are at an increased risk of major cardiovascular events compared with population controls. Being prescribed an enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug is not associated with a greater risk of a major cardiovascular event compared to treatment with other antiepileptic drugs. Our data emphasize the importance of cardiovascular risk management in the clinical care of people with epilepsy.","Lee-Lane, Elinor; Torabi, Fatemeh; Lacey, Arron; Fonferko-Shadrach, Beata; Harris, Daniel; Akbari, Ashley; Lyons, Ronan A; Rees, Mark I; Sawhney, Inder; Halcox, Julian; Powell, Rob; Pickrell, William Owen",Epilepsia,,209

Since 2019-nCoV is a newly emerging virus, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is not well known. Most patients had a self-limited course, and some became severe even death. In this review, the authors compared two coronavirus outbreaks during the past two decades: the SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. Among the biological nature of the pathogens, viral receptor distribution on the human cells, and the pathological findings in the targeted organs and clinical features of the patients with the diseases, found similarities and differences between the two diseases had been found. Due to the shared receptor ACE2 and the pathological similarities of the SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV diseases,authors proposed a pathogenesis model for COVID-19. Like the SARS-CoV disease, COVID-19 is a systematic disease and targets the lungs, vasculatures, and the immune system. The basic pathogenesis involves two interlinked processes: a severe lung inflammation and immune deficiency, both of which were related to an inappropriate immune response and over-production of cytokines. Thus, treatment approaches should include antiviral and anti-proinflammatory cytokines, anti-infectious and life support therapies, especially in patients with severe diseases.","Wang, X; Ding, Y Q",Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,,209

Nevertheless, the risk of QT prolongation due to drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between hydroxychloroquine and concomitant medications has not yet been identified. To evaluate the risk of QT prolongation due to DDIs between hydroxychloroquine and 118 concurrent drugs frequently used in real-world practice, we analyzed the electrocardiogram results obtained for 447,632 patients and their relevant electronic health records in a tertiary teaching hospital in Korea from 1996 to 2018. We repeated the case-control analysis for each drug. In each analysis, we performed multiple logistic regression and calculated the odds ratio (OR) for each target drug, hydroxychloroquine, and the interaction terms between those two drugs. The DDIs were observed in 12 drugs (trimebutine, tacrolimus, tramadol, rosuvastatin, cyclosporin, sulfasalazine, rofecoxib, diltiazem, piperacillin/tazobactam, isoniazid, clarithromycin, and furosemide), all with a p value of < 0.05 (OR 1.70-17.85).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the mental state of the medical students switching to OL in comparison with the mental state of the students who had traditional learning (TL). A repeated questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students ranging from 1st year to 5th year at Astana Medical University in the 2019-2020 academic year. The first study was conducted during the TL (October-November 2019, N = 619), and the second study was conducted during the OL period (April 2020, N = 798). Burnout syndrome, depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and satisfaction with academic performance have been studied. The findings revealed that prevalence of the burnout syndrome, depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms decreased after transitioning from TL to OL. However, during the OL period, the prevalence of colleague-related burnout increased, which tells us about the negative impact of OL on students' communication and interpersonal relationships. The most common depression and anxiety symptoms, dissatisfaction with academic performance were among students who indicated a decrease in academic performance during OL.

246056,A perspective review on siddha system of medicine in the management of corona virus disease 2019,2021,"BACKGROUND: The presence of co-morbidities, including underlying respiratory problems, has been identified as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease. Information on the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) is limited, yet vital to provide accurate advice for children with CF, their families, caregivers and clinical teams. METHODS: Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with CF aged less than 18 years were collated by the CF Registry Global Harmonization Group across 13 countries between 1 February and 7 August 2020. RESULTS: Data on 105 children were collated and analysed. Median age of cases was ten years (interquartile range 6-15), 54% were male and median percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in one second was 94% (interquartile range 79-104). The majority (71%) of children were managed in the community during their COVID-19 illness. Out of 24 children admitted to hospital, six required supplementary oxygen and two non-invasive ventilation. Around half were prescribed antibiotics, five children received antiviral treatments, four azithromycin and one additional corticosteroids. Children that were hospitalised had lower lung function and reduced body mass index Z-scores. One child died six weeks after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 following a deterioration that was not attributed to COVID-19 disease. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with CF is usually associated with a mild illness in those who do not have pre-existing severe lung disease.","Bain, Robert; Cosgriff, Rebecca; Zampoli, Marco; Elbert, Alexander; Burgel, Pierre-Régis; Carr, Siobhán B; Castaños, Claudio; Colombo, Carla; Corvol, Harriet; Faro, Albert; Goss, Christopher H; Gutierrez, Hector; Jung, Andreas; Kashirskaya, Nataliya; Marshall, Bruce C; Melo, Joel; Mondejar-Lopez, Pedro; de Monestrol, Isabelle; Naehrlich, Lutz; Padoan, Rita; Pastor-Vivero, Maria Dolores; Rizvi, Samar; Salvatore, Marco; Filho, Luiz Vicente Ribeiro Ferreira da Silva; Brownlee, Keith G; Haq, Iram J; Brodlie, Malcolm",J Cyst Fibros,,209

246622,Similar incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with rheumatic diseases with and without hydroxychloroquine therapy,2021,"There is agreement that the pandemic has affected the healthcare system and behaviour of patients. This study aims to identify problems encountered by patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) and their parents/caregivers during the six-week pandemic lockdown in Poland (15 March to 30 April 2020). To determine the factors that influenced health and treatment-related issues, as well as the respondents' perception of the impact of the pandemic, study participants were asked to complete a non-validated online questionnaire comprising 31 questions (including 27 single-choice, two multiple-choice and two open-ended ones). A total of 571 patients or their parents completed the questionnaire, with 9.5% of respondents not performing any blood phenylalanine (Phe) test in the analysed period, 21.3% declaring a blood Phe increase, and 15.3% a decrease. Increased problems in contacting the doctor or dietitian were reported by 26.1% of subjects, whereas 39.3% of them felt restricted access to dietary products. Most (63.4%) participants were satisfied with remote contact with their PKU clinic. Better compliance was associated with higher odds of acceptance of remote contact and of reporting fewer problems with contacting the doctor, and with lower odds of missing Phe testing. Self-reported high stress was associated with higher odds of reporting the limited availability of low-Phe products and Phe-free formulas, as well as with increased Phe concentrations and non-PKU-related health problems. These patients also had poor dietary compliance and experienced more problems in contacting specialists. Health and treatment-related problems experienced during the pandemic lockdown were related to a higher intensity of stress in patient's family and worse therapy compliance before the pandemic. Previous experience of remote visits resulted in a better perception of this method of contact. It seems that this form of communication should be popularized and improved to increase therapy effectiveness in case of different limitations in the future. Special attention should be paid to vulnerable patients who may be at extra risk when the provision of standard care is affected.","Walkowiak, Dariusz; Mikoluc, Bozena; Mozrzymas, Renata; Kaluzny, Lukasz; Didycz, Bozena; Korycinska-Chaaban, Dorota; Patalan, Michal; Jaglowska, Joanna; Chrobot, Agnieszka; Starostecka, Ewa; Zarebska, Joanna; Walkowiak, Jaroslaw",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,209

248965,Experience in Gynecologic Cancers During Corona Virus Disease-2019 Pandemic: A Study from Tertiary Cancer Center in India,2020,"Background & objectives: The presence of Cat Que virus (CQV) in Culex mosquitoes and pigs has been reported in China and Vietnam. Due to the spread of similar species of the Culex mosquitoes in India, there is a need to understand the replication kinetics of this virus in mosquito models. As a part of preparedness and to identify the presence of this CQV in humans and swine, this study was carried out to develop diagnostic tests. Methods: Serological and molecular diagnostic assays were developed for testing the mosquito population, human and swine serum samples. In this line, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L), glycoprotein (M) and nucleocapsid (S) genes-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were developed for CQV. Real-time RT-PCR was used for screening of retrospectively collected human serum samples (n=1020) with acute febrile illness during 2014-2017. Simultaneously, an in-house anti-CQV swine and human IgG ELISAs were also developed to detect anti-CQV IgG antibody. Human serum samples (n=883) with post-onset of disease (POD) >4 days and swine serum samples (n=459) were tested for the presence of anti-CQV IgG antibodies. CQV NIV 612,045 isolate was used for susceptibility and replication kinetics experiment using three different species of mosquitoes to understand its behaviour in Indian mosquitoes. Results: All human serum samples (n=1020) screened for the presence of CQV using real-time RT-PCR were found to be negative. Anti-CQV IgG antibody positivity was recorded in two of 883 human serum samples tested. Virus susceptibility experiments indicated that three species of mosquito, namely Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus supported multiplication of CQV by intrathoracic as well as artificial membrane/oral feeding routes. Interpretation & conclusions: Anti-CQV IgG antibody positivity in human serum samples tested and the replication capability of CQV in mosquitoes indicated a possible disease causing potential of CQV in Indian scenario. Screening of more human and swine serum samples using these assays is required as a proactive measure for understanding the prevalence of this neglected tropical virus.","Shete, Anita; Yadav, Pragya D; Gokhale, Mangesh; Jain, Rajlaxmi; Pardeshi, Prachi; Majumdar, Triparna; Mourya, Devendra T",Indian J Med Res,,209

Materials and Methods: A nationwide cohort of confirmed COVID-19 (n=8,070) between January 1, 2020, and May 30, 2020, and a 1:15 age-, sex-, and residence-matched cohort (n=121,050) were constructed. A nested case-control study to compare the proportion of patients with lung cancer between the COVID-19 cohort and the matched cohort. Results: The proportion of patients with lung cancer was significantly higher in the COVID-19 cohort (0.5% [37/8,070]) than in the matched cohort (0.3% [325/121,050]) (p=0.002). The adjusted odds ratio [OR] of having lung cancer was significantly higher in the COVID-19 cohort than in the matched cohort (adjusted OR = 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-2.10). Among patients in the COVID-19 cohort, compared to patients without lung cancer, those with lung cancer were more likely to have severe COVID-19 (54.1% vs. 13.2%, p < 0.01), including mortality (18.5% vs. 2.8%, p < 0.01). The adjusted OR for the occurrence of severe COVID-19 in patients with lung cancer relative to those without lung cancer was 2.24 (95% CI = 1.08-4.74).

At the beginning, patients may have normal lung compliance and be responsive to noninvasive ventilatory support, such as CPAP. However, the transition to more severe respiratory failure - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), necessitating invasive ventilation is often abrupt and characterized by a severe V/Q mismatch that require cycles of prone positioning. The aim of this case is to report the effect on gas exchange, respiratory mechanics and hemodynamics of tripod (or orthopneic sitting position) used as an alternative to prone position in a patient with mild SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ventilated with helmet CPAP. CASE PRESENTATION: A 77-year-old awake and collaborating male patient with mild SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and ventilated with Helmet CPAP, showed sudden worsening of gas exchange without dyspnea. After an unsuccessful attempt of prone positioning, we alternated three-hours cycles of semi-recumbent and tripod position, still keeping him in CPAP. Arterial blood gases (PaO2/FiO2, PaO2, SaO2, PaCO2 and A/a gradient), respiratory (VE, VT, RR) and hemodynamic parameters (HR, MAP) were collected in the supine and tripod position. Cycles of tripod position were continued for 3 days. The patient had a clinically important improvement in arterial blood gases and respiratory parameters, with stable hemodynamic and was successfully weaned and discharged to ward 10 days after pneumonia onset. CONCLUSIONS: Tripod position during Helmet CPAP can be applied safely in patients with mild SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, with improvement of oxygenation and V/Q matching, thus reducing the need for intubation.","Rauseo, Michela; Mirabella, Lucia; Caporusso, Rosa Roberta; Cantatore, Leonarda Pia; Perrini, Marco Paolo; Vetuschi, Paolo; La Bella, Daniela; Tullo, Livio; Cinnella, Gilda",BMC Anesthesiol,,209
252140,Scientific guidance to fight the pandemic: the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),2021,"BACKGROUND: Maintaining compliance with personal preventive measures is important to achieve a balance of COVID-19 pandemic control and work resumption. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate self-reported compliance with four personal measures to prevent COVID-19 among a sample of factory workers in Shenzhen, China, at the beginning of work resumption in China following the COVID-19 outbreak. These preventive measures included consistent wearing of face masks in public spaces (the workplace and other public settings); sanitizing hands using soap, liquid soap, or alcohol-based hand sanitizer after returning from public spaces or touching public installations and equipment; avoiding social and meal gatherings; and avoiding crowded places. METHODS: The participants were adult factory workers who had resumed work in Shenzhen, China. A stratified two-stage cluster sampling design was used. We randomly selected 14 factories that had resumed work. All full-time employees aged &#8805;18 years who had resumed work in these factories were invited to complete a web-based survey. Out of 4158 workers who had resumed work in these factories, 3035 (73.0%) completed the web-based survey from March 1 to 14, 2020. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted. RESULTS: Among the 3035 participants, 2938 (96.8%) and 2996 (98.7%) reported always wearing a face mask in the workplace and in other public settings, respectively, in the past month. However, frequencies of self-reported sanitizing hands (2152/3035, 70.9%), avoiding social and meal gatherings (2225/3035, 73.3%), and avoiding crowded places (1997/3035, 65.8%) were relatively low. At the individual level, knowledge about COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] from 1.16, CI 1.10-1.24, to 1.29, CI 1.21-1.37), perceived risk (AORs from 0.58, CI 0.50-0.68, to 0.85, CI 0.72-0.99) and severity (AOR 1.05, CI 1.01-1.09, and AOR 1.07, CI 1.03-1.11) of COVID-19, perceived effectiveness of preventive measures by the individual (AORs from 1.05, CI 1.00-1.10, to 1.09, CI 1.04-1.13), organization (AOR 1.30, CI 1.20-1.41), and government (AORs from 1.14, CI 1.04-1.25, to 1.21, CI 1.02-1.42), perceived preparedness for a potential outbreak after work resumption (AORs from 1.10, CI 1.00-1.21, to 1.50, CI 1.36-1.64), and depressive symptoms (AORs from 0.93, CI 0.91-0.94, to 0.96, CI 0.92-0.99) were associated with self-reported compliance with at least one personal preventive measure. At the interpersonal level, exposure to COVID-19-specific information through official media channels (AOR 1.08, CI 1.04-1.11) and face-to-face communication (AOR 0.90, CI 0.83-0.98) were associated with self-reported sanitizing of hands. The number of preventive measures implemented in the workplace was positively associated with self-reported compliance with all four preventive measures (AORs from 1.30, CI 1.08-1.57, to 1.63, CI 1.45-1.84). CONCLUSIONS: Measures are needed to strengthen hand hygiene and physical distancing among factory workers to reduce transmission following work resumption. Future programs in workplaces should address these factors at multiple levels.","Pan, Yihang; Fang, Yuan; Xin, Meiqi; Dong, Willa; Zhou, Liemin; Hou, Qinghua; Li, Fanping; Sun, Gang; Zheng, Zilong; Yuan, Jinqiu; Wang, Zixin; He, Yulong",J Med Internet Res,,209

The disease, referred to as COVID-19, has an alarming mortality rate and it is having a devastating effect on the global economy and public health systems. A safe, effective vaccine is urgently needed to halt this pandemic. In this study, immunogenicity of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) glycoprotein was examined in mice. Animals were immunized with recombinant RBD antigen intraperitoneally using three different adjuvants (Zn-chitosan, Alhydrogel, and Adju-Phos), and antibody responses were followed for over 5 months. Results showed that potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) can be induced with 70% neutralization titer (NT70) of ~14,580 against live, infectious viruses. Although antigen-binding antibody titers decreased gradually over time, sufficiently protective levels of nAbs persisted (NT80 >2,430) over the 5-month observation period. Results also showed that adjuvants have profound effects on kinetics of nAb induction, total antibody titers, antibody avidity, antibody longevity, and B-cell epitopes targeted by the immune system. In conclusion, a recombinant subunit protein immunogen based on the RBD is a highly promising vaccine candidate. Continued evaluation of RBD immunogenicity using different adjuvants and vaccine regimens could further improve vaccine efficacy.","Srivastava, Vikram; Niu, Ling; Phadke, Kruttika S; Bellaire, Bryan H; Cho, Michael W",Front Immunol,,209
254940,ELSI Implications of Prioritizing Biological Therapies in Times of COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There likely are several predisposing factors to secondary infections in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), some of which may be preventable. The aim of this review is to explore the literature, summarize potential predisposing factors to secondary infections and their incidence. It also summarizes a variety of healthcare scenarios in which different kinds of secondary infections occur. RECENT FINDINGS: Apart from immune dysregulation, severe resource limitations in healthcare settings have made COVID-19 units conducive to a variety of secondary infections. Long-term effect of excess antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients is yet to be studied. Very few studies have assessed secondary infections as the primary outcome measure making it difficult to know the true incidence. Mortality attributable to secondary infections in COVID-19 patients is also unclear. SUMMARY: Incidence of secondary infections in COVID-19 patients is likely higher than what is reported in the literature. Well designed studies are needed to understand the incidence and impact of secondary infections in this patient population. Many of these may be preventable especially now, as personal protective equipment and other healthcare resources are recovering. Infection prevention and control (IPC) and antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASP) must reassess current situation to correct any breaches that could potentially cause more harm in these already vulnerable patients as we brace for a future surge with another pandemic wave.","Sopirala, Madhuri M",Curr. opin. infect. dis,,209

During the period of evolving facts and recommendations of WHO for maintaining precautions this study is an effort to understand the preparedness of dental practitioners to resume their practice. Objectives-The objective of this study is to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and practice of dental practitioners regarding the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods-This cross-sectional study was conducted among dental practitioners of India through an online questionnaire-based survey to collect data. The questionnaire was divided into sections containing structured multiple-choice questions about the knowledge, attitude and practice of dental practitioners. Result-Upon analyzing 311 responses it has been observed that majority of dental practitioners were aware of common symptoms of Covid-19 and about the modes of transmission of the disease. They possess adequate knowledge about use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with 88.4 % suggesting to use it while performing aerosol generating procedure. Their awareness about a Covid-19 patient becoming noninfectious is inadequate with only 10% reporting 30 days. Attitude and practice of dental practitioners regarding Covid-19 were stratified on the basis of years of practice. Conclusions-Dental practitioners possess adequate knowledge about standard precaution protocol although they are less aware about transmission-based precaution specific to Covid-19 situation.

This review provides a comprehensive overview of ocular parameters in humans and selected animals, with a focus on the ocular surface, detailing species differences in ocular surface anatomy, physiology, tear film dynamics and tear film composition. We describe major pitfalls that tremendously limit the translational potential of traditional laboratory animals (i.e., rabbits, mice, and rats) in ophthalmic research, and highlight the benefits of integrating companion dogs with clinical analogues to human diseases into preclinical pharmacology studies. This One Health approach can help accelerate and improve the framework in which ophthalmic research is translated to the human clinic. Studies can be conducted in canine subjects with naturally occurring or noninvasively induced ocular surface disorders (e.g., dry eye disease, conjunctivitis), reviewed herein, and tear fluid can be easily retrieved from canine eyes for various bioanalytical purposes. In this review, we discuss common tear collection methods, including capillary tubes and Schirmer tear strips, and provide guidelines for tear sampling and extraction to improve the reliability of analyte quantification (drugs, proteins, others).","Sebbag, Lionel; Mochel, Jonathan P",Med. res. rev,,209

CSCs are defined by their ability to divide both symmetrically and asymmetrically, to initiate new tumour growth and to tolerate the foreign niches required for metastatic dissemination. Accumulating evidence suggests that tumours arise from cells with stem-like properties, the generation of CSCs is therefore likely to be an initiatory event in carcinogenesis. Furthermore, CSCs in established tumours exist in a dynamic and plastic state, with non-stem tumour cells thought to be capable of de-differentiation to CSCs. The regulation of the CSC state both during tumour initiation and within established tumours is a desirable therapeutic target and is mediated by epigenetic factors. In this review we will explore the epigenetic parallels between induced pluripotency and the generation of CSCs, and discuss how the epigenetic regulation of CSCs opens up novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

Compared to the classical self-exciting Hawkes process, the EAH model exhibits more flexibility in a macro environmentally temporal sense, and can model more complex processes by using dynamic branching matrix. We demonstrate the well-definedness of this EAH model. A more specified version of this new model is applied to model COVID-19 pandemic data through an efficient EM-like algorithm. Consequently, the proposed model consistently outperforms the classical Hawkes process.","Gong, Tingnan; Chen, Yu; Zhang, Weiping",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09942v1.pdf,209
267357,COVID-19 pneumonia successfully managed with high-flow nasal cannula in a 15-year-old boy,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 makes its way into the cell via the ACE2 receptor and the proteolytic action of TMPRSS2. In response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the innate immune response is the first line of defense, triggering multiple signaling pathways to produce interferons, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and initiating the adaptive immune response against the virus. Unsurprisingly, the virus has developed strategies to evade detection, which can result in delayed, excessive activation of the innate immune system. The response elicited by the host depends on multiple factors, including health status, age, and sex. An overactive innate immune response can lead to a cytokine storm, inflammation, and vascular disruption, leading to the vast array of symptoms exhibited by COVID-19 patients. What is known about the expression and epigenetic regulation of the ACE2 gene and the various players in the host response are explored in this review.","Beacon, Tasnim H; Su, Ruey-Chyi; Lakowski, Ted M; Delcuve, Geneviève P; Davie, James R",IUBMB life,,209

Our understanding of the clinical characteristics of liver damage and the relationship with disease severity in COVID-19 is still limited. To investigate the serum hepatic enzyme activities in different phenotypes of COVID-19 patients, evaluate their relationship with the illness severity and analyze the correlation of glycyrrhizin treatment and abnormal liver enzyme activities, one hundred and forty-seven patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in a retrospective study that investigated hepatic dysfunction. Liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), Y-glutamyl transferase (GGT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were analyzed in these patients. Patients with diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG) treatment were further investigated. Of the 147 patients, 56 (38.1%) had abnormal ALT activity and 80 (54.4%) had abnormal AST activity. The peak of abnormal hepatic enzyme activities occurred at 3 to 6 days after on admission. Serum AST and LDH levels were elevated, while the SOD level was decreased in severe and critical patients, compared with mild cases. DG treatment may alleviate the abnormal liver enzyme activities in non-critical COVID-19 patients. Abnormal liver functions may be observed in patients with COVID-19, and were associated with SARS-CoV-2-induced acute liver damage. Glycyrrhizin treatment may be an effective therapeutic approach for the outcome of abnormal hepatic enzyme activities in severe COVID-19 cases. Serum hepatic enzyme tests may reflect the illness severity and should be monitored.","Liao, Fan-Lu; Peng, Ding-Hui; Chen, Wei; Hu, Han-Ning; Tang, Peng; Liu, Yan-Yuan; Luo, Yi; Yao, Tao",J. med. virol,,209

274304,Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) presenting as purulent fulminant myopericarditis and cardiac tamponade: A case report and literature review,2020,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgeons found ways to provide appropriate care while conserving inpatient resources and limiting potential exposure. For patients with adult spinal deformity (ASD), spine surgery often requires extended LOS and non-routine discharge. Given resource limitations during the COVID-19 pandemic and caution regarding hospital stays, surgeons have modified standard postoperative protocols to minimize patient exposure. PURPOSE The primary aim of this study was to compare LOS and discharge disposition of ASD patients undergoing surgery before and during the pandemic. Secondary aims were to compare the rates of 30-day complications, readmissions, and ED visits. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING Retrospective review of an institutional surgical registry. PATIENT SAMPLE A total of 117 patients with adult thoracolumbar deformity. OUTCOME MEASURES Outcome measures included LOS and discharge disposition (home vs non-home), as well as 30-day major complications, reoperations, readmissions and ED visits. METHODS We identified all patients who underwent elective thoracolumbar ASD surgery with ≥5 levels fusion at a tertiary care center during two distinct time intervals: Jul-Dec 2019 (Pre-COVID, N=60) and Jul-Dec 2020 (During-COVID, N=57). Outcome measures included LOS and discharge disposition (home vs non-home), as well as 30-day major complications, reoperations, readmissions, and ED visits. Regression analyses controlled for demographic and surgical factors. RESULTS Patients who underwent ASD surgery during the pandemic were younger (61 vs 67 years) and had longer fusion constructs (9 vs 8 levels) compared to before pandemic (p&lt;0.05 for both). On bivariate analysis, patients undergoing surgery during the pandemic had significantly lower LOS (6 vs 8 days) and were more likely to be discharged home (70% vs 28%) (p&lt;0.05 for both). After controlling for age and levels fused on multivariable regression, patients who had surgery during the pandemic continued to demonstrate a significantly lower LOS (IRR=0.83, p=0.015) and greater odds of home discharge (OR=7.2, p&lt;0.001). Notably, there were no significant differences in reoperations, readmissions, ED visits, or major complications between the two groups (p&gt;0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, the LOS for patients undergoing thoracolumbar ASD surgery decreased, and more patients were discharged home without adversely affecting complication or readmission rates. Lessons learned during the pandemic may help improve resource utilization without negatively influencing outcomes.

We describe how a large academic radiology department achieved socially distant ""remote readouts,"" provide trainee and attending perspectives on this early experience, and propose ways by which ""remote readouts"" can be used effectively by training programs beyond COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Beginning March 2020, radiologists were relocated to workspaces outside of conventional reading rooms. Information technologies were employed to allow for ""remote readouts"" between trainees and attendings. An optional anonymous open-ended survey regarding remote readouts was administered to radiology trainees and attendings as a quality improvement initiative. From the responses, response themes were abstracted using thematic analysis. Descriptive statistics of the qualitative data were calculated. RESULTS: Radiologist workstations from 14 traditional reading rooms were relocated to 36 workspaces across the hospital system. Two models of remote readouts, synchronous and asynchronous, were developed, facilitated by commercially available information technologies. Thirty-nine of 105 (37%) trainees and 42 of 90 (47%) attendings responded to the survey. Main response themes included: social distancing, technology, autonomy/competency, efficiency, education/feedback and atmosphere/professional relationship. One hundred and forty-eight positive versus 97 negative comments were reported. Social distancing, technology, and autonomy/competency were most positively rated. Trainees and attending perspectives differed regarding the efficiency of remote readouts.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of medical charts of patients arrived at the ED of Gaslini Children's Hospital from 10th March 2020 to 30th April 2019 and the same frame of 2020 were performed. We compared two groups by demographics, duration of fever before ED admission, triage code, number of patients hospitalized after ED evaluation. We calculated proportion and incidence rate for airborne infections, fever, and urinary tract infections (UTI), appendicitis, and gastroenteritis for control. RESULTS: 1362 children arrived at the ED during the lockdown compared to 5628 in the same period of 2019 (-75,8%). No difference was noticed (27.7% vs 28.4%) in the total amount of infectious episodes. A significant reduction in rate of incidence and proportion were observed for upper respiratory tract infections (21,4% vs 28%), otitis (2,6% vs 16,2%), streptococcal infections (0,5% vs 5,2%) and bronchiolitis (2,1% vs 5,7%). Conversely, FUO (27,8 vs 11,1%), infectious mononucleosis (2,6% vs 0,4%), UTI (7,4% vs 2,9%) and appendicitis (6,8% vs 1,1%) significantly increased. Median time from the onset of fever and arrival in ED was significantly lower in 2020 group. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated a reduction in community-acquired respiratory infections during the lockdown for COVID-19. The increase in rate of FUO and febrile conditions, together with the short time from fever onset and ED visit could be related to the fear for a SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Rotulo, Gioacchino Andrea; Percivale, Beatrice; Molteni, Marta; Naim, Alessandro; Brisca, Giacomo; Piccotti, Emanuela; Castagnola, Elio",Am J Emerg Med,,209

Herein, a colorimetic serological assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgGs in patients' plasma was developed using short antigenic epitopes conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Four immunodominant linear B-cell epitopes, located on the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2, were characterized for their IgG binding affinity and used as highly specific biological motifs on the nanoparticle to recognize target antibodies. Specific bivalent binding between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and epitope-functionalized AuNPs trigger nanoparticle aggregation, which manifests as a distinct optical transition in the AuNPs' plasmon characteristics within 30 min of antibody introduction. Co-immobilization of two epitopes improved the assay sensitivity relative to single-epitope AuNPs with a limit of detection of 3.2 nM, commensurate with IgG levels in convalescent COVID-19-infected patients. A passivation strategy was further pursued to preserve the sensing response in human plasma medium. When tested against 35 clinical plasma samples of varying illness severity, the optimized nanosensor assay can successfully identify SARS-CoV-2 infection with 100% specificity and 83% sensitivity. As the epitopes are conserved within the circulating COVID-19 variants, the proposed platform holds great potential to serve as a cost-effective and highly specific alternative to classical immunoassays employing recombinant viral proteins. These epitope-enabled nanosensors further expand the serodiagnostic toolbox for COVID-19 epidemiological study, humoral response monitoring, or vaccine efficiency assessment.","Lew, Tedrick Thomas Salim; Aung, Khin Moh Moh; Ow, Sian Yang; Amrun, Siti Naqiah; Sutarlie, Laura; Ng, Lisa F P; Su, Xiaodi",ACS nano,,209

281063,Preserving 2 decades of healthcare gains for Africa in the coronavirus disease 2019 era,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Following well-established practices in demography, this article discusses several measures based on the number of COVID-19 deaths to facilitate comparisons over time and across populations. SETTINGS: National populations in 186 United Nations countries and territories and populations in first-level subnational administrative entities in Brazil, China, Italy, Mexico, Peru, Spain and the USA. PARTICIPANTS: None (death statistics only). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: An unstandardised occurrence/exposure rate comparable to the Crude Death Rate; an indirectly age-and-sex standardised rate that can be derived even when the breakdown of COVID-19 deaths by age and sex required for direct standardisation is unavailable; the reduction in life expectancy at birth corresponding to the 2020 number of COVID-19 deaths. RESULTS: To date, the highest unstandardised rate has been in New York, at its peak exceeding the state 2017 crude death rate. Populations compare differently after standardisation: while parts of Italy, Spain and the USA have the highest unstandardised rates, parts of Mexico and Peru have the highest standardised rates. For several populations with the necessary data by age and sex for direct standardisation, we show that direct and indirect standardisation yield similar results. US life expectancy is estimated to have declined this year by more than a year (-1.26 years), far more than during the worst year of the HIV epidemic, or the worst 3 years of the opioid crisis, and to reach its lowest level since 2008. Substantially larger reductions, exceeding 2 years, are estimated for Panama, Peru, and parts of Italy, Spain, the USA and especially, Mexico. CONCLUSIONS: With lesser demand on data than direct standardisation, indirect standardisation is a valid alternative to adjust international comparisons for differences in population distribution by sex and age-groups. A number of populations have experienced reductions in 2020 life expectancies that are substantial by recent historical standards.","Heuveline, Patrick; Tzen, Michael",BMJ Open,,209

Toxicity from hydroxychloroquine manifests with cardiac conduction abnormalities, seizure activity, and muscle weakness. Recognizing this toxidrome and unique management of this toxicity is important in the COVID-19 pandemic. CASE REPORT: A 27-year-old man with a history of rheumatoid arthritis presented to the emergency department 7 hours after an intentional overdose of hydroxychloroquine. Initial presentation demonstrated proximal muscle weakness. The patient was found to have a QRS complex of 134 ms and QTc of 710 ms. He was treated with early orotracheal intubation and intravenous diazepam boluses. Due to difficulties formulating continuous diazepam infusions, we opted to utilize an intermitted intravenous bolus strategy that achieved similar effects that a continuous infusion would. The patient recovered without residual side effects. DISCUSSION: Hydroxychloroquine toxicity is rare but projected to increase in frequency given its selection as a potential modality to treat COVID-19 disease. It is important for clinicians to recognize the unique effects of hydroxychloroquine poisoning and initiate appropriate emergency maneuvers to improve the outcomes in these patients.","Chai, Peter R; Ferro, E G; Kirshenbaum, J M; Hayes, B D; Culbreth, S E; Boyer, E W; Erickson, T B",J Med Toxicol,,209

The newly emerged disease spread in almost all countries and infected 100 million persons worldwide. The infection is not limited to the respiratory system but involves various body systems and may lead to multiple organ failure. Tissue degenerative changes result from direct viral invasion, indirect consequences, or through an uncontrolled immune response. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads to the brain via hematogenous and neural routes accompanied with dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier. The involvement of the central nervous system is now suspected to be among the main causes of death. The present review discusses the historical background of coronaviruses, their role in previous and ongoing pandemics, the way they escape the immune system, why they are able to spread despite all undertaken measures, in addition to the neurological manifestations, long-term consequences of the disease, and various routes of viral introduction to the CNS.","El-Sayed, Amr; Aleya, Lotfi; Kamel, Mohamed",,,209

283811,Performance of Chest Computed Tomography in Differentiating Coronavirus Disease 2019 From Other Viral Infections Using a Standardized Classification,2020,"BACKGROUND: Although there are a growing number of studies on evaluating lymphocyte subset counts as prognostic factors for COVID-19 disease severity, the lymphocyte subsets' analyses of both IgM and IgG responders and non-responders during the periods after onset of symptoms, have not been conducted yet. So, this study aimed to evaluate immune cell profiling of COVID-19 patients with and without antibody responses. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the levels of peripheral lymphocyte subsets were measured using flow cytometry in 53 patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, for whom antibody testing of COVID-19 was performed. RESULTS: The white blood cell, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts consistently decreased in the IgM and IgG non-responder group, while the differences in the median value between the two study groups were found to be statistically significant only in terms of neutrophil counts (P = 0.024 for IgM response and p-value = 0.046 for IgG response, respectively). Moreover, the level of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was observed to be significantly lower in the IgM or IgG non-responder group compared to the IgM or IgG responder group (3.6 ± 3.1 vs. 6.3 ± 4.2; p-value = 0.021). The patients with IgM antibody response had a significantly lower CD20+ lymphocytes (11% versus 15% in the groups without IgM antibody response, p-value = 0.031), The percentages of NK cells and CD4+ T cells significantly increased in the patients with IgG antibody response compared to those without IgG antibody response (13% versus 10%, p-value = 0.028, and 41.5% versus 34%; p-value = 0.03, respectively). Moreover, the patients who produced IgM or IgG antibody had significantly higher percentages of total T lymphocytes (64% versus 54%; p-value = 0.017), CD4+ T cells (41% versus 34%; p-value = 0.038), and NK cells (13% versus 9%, p-value = 0.023) compared to the group with no serological response. No significant difference was observed in the percentage of other lymphocyte subsets, including CD8+ T cells, Treg cells, and CD19+ B cells. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the total T cells, CD4+ T cells, and NK cells percentages are linked to serological response. Moreover, our findings suggested that neutrophil absolute counts and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio may be valuable predictors of IgM or IgG antibody response.","Rezaei, Mitra; Mahmoudi, Shima; Mortaz, Esmaeil; Marjani, Majid",BMC Infect Dis,,209

287517,Therapeutic Strategy for Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 During Left Ventricular Assist Device Supports,2020,"The main aspects of severe COVID-19 disease pathogenesis include hyper-induction of proinflammatory cytokines, also known as 'cytokine storm', that precedes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and often leads to death. COVID-19 patients often suffer from lung fibrosis, a serious and untreatable condition. There remains no effective treatment for these complications. Out of all cytokines, TNF&#945; and IL-6 play crucial roles in cytokine storm pathogenesis and are likely responsible for the escalation in disease severity. These cytokines also partake in the molecular pathogenesis of fibrosis. Therefore, new approaches are urgently needed, that can efficiently and swiftly downregulate TNF&#945;, IL-6, and the inflammatory cytokine cascade, in order to curb inflammation and prevent fibrosis, and lead to disease remission. Cannabis sativa has been proposed to modulate gene expression and inflammation and is under investigation for several potential therapeutic applications against autoinflammatory diseases and cancer. Here, we hypothesized that the extracts of novel C. sativa cultivars may be used to downregulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pathways involved in inflammation and fibrosis. Initially, to analyze the anti-inflammatory effects of novel C. sativa cultivars, we used a well-established full thickness human 3D skin artificial EpiDermFTTM tissue model, whereby tissues were exposed to UV to induce inflammation and then treated with extracts of seven new cannabis cultivars. We noted that out of seven studied extracts of novel C. sativa cultivars, three (#4, #8 and #14) were the most effective, causing profound and concerted down-regulation of COX2, TNF&#945;, IL-6, CCL2, and other cytokines and pathways related to inflammation and fibrosis. These data were further confirmed in the WI-38 lung fibroblast cell line model. Most importantly, one of the tested extracts had no effect at all, and one exerted effect that may be deleterious, signifying that careful cannabis cultivar selection must be based on thorough pre-clinical studies. The observed pronounced inhibition of TNF&#945; and IL-6 is the most important finding, because these molecules are currently considered to be the main targets in COVID-19 cytokine storm and ARDS pathogenesis. Novel anti-TNF&#945; and anti-IL-6 cannabis extracts can be useful additions to the current anti-inflammatory regimens to treat COVID-19, as well as various rheumatological diseases and conditions, and 'inflammaging' - the inflammatory underpinning of aging and frailty.","Kovalchuk, Anna; Wang, Bo; Li, Dongping; Rodriguez-Juarez, Rocio; Ilnytskyy, Slava; Kovalchuk, Igor; Kovalchuk, Olga",Aging (Albany NY),,209

High throughput sequencing technologies that capture genome and transcriptome information are key approaches to gain detailed mechanistic insights from infected cells. These techniques readily detect both pathogen and host-derived sequences, providing a means of studying host-pathogen interactions. Recent studies have reported the presence of host-virus chimeric (HVC) RNA in RNA-seq data from SARS-CoV2 infected cells and interpreted these findings as evidence of viral integration in the human genome as a potential pathogenic mechanism. Since SARS-CoV2 is a positive-sense RNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm it does not have a nuclear phase in its life cycle. Thus, it is biologically unlikely to be in a location where splicing events could result in genome integration. Therefore, we investigated the biological authenticity of HVC events. In contrast to true biological events such as mRNA splicing and genome rearrangement events, which generate reproducible chimeric sequencing fragments across different biological isolates, we found that HVC events across >100 RNA-seq libraries from patients with COVID-19 and infected cell lines were highly irreproducible. RNA-seq library preparation is inherently error-prone due to random template switching during reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA. By counting chimeric events observed when constructing an RNA-seq library from human RNA and spike-in RNA from an unrelated species, such as fruit-fly, we estimated that â¼1% of RNA-seq reads are artifactually chimeric. In SARS-CoV2 RNA-seq we found that the frequency of HVC events was, in fact, not greater than this background ""noise"". Finally, we developed a novel experimental approach to enrich SARS-CoV2 sequences from bulk RNA of infected cells. This method enriched viral sequences but did not enrich for HVC events, suggesting that the majority of HVC events are, in all likelihood, artifacts of library construction. In conclusion, our findings indicate that HVC events observed in RNA-sequencing libraries from SARS-CoV2 infected cells are extremely rare and are likely artifacts arising from either random template switching of reverse-transcriptase and/or sequence alignment errors. Therefore, the observed HVC events do not support SARS-CoV2 fusion to cellular genes and/or integration into human genomes.ImportanceThe pathogenic mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, are not fully understood.

289352,POS-214 The outcome of COVID-19 patients with acute kidney injury and the factors affecting mortality,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Since the first novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient in Korea was diagnosed on January 20, 2020, 30 patients were diagnosed until February 17, 2020. However, 5,298 additional patients were confirmed until March 4, 2020. Therefore, our objective was to estimate the reproduction number (R) and evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures. METHODS: A COVID-19 transmission model (SEIHR) was established to suit the Korean outbreak. The number of daily confirmed cases in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province (NGP), the main area of outbreak, was used. The first patient' symptom onset date in the Daegu/NGP outbreak was assumed as January 22, 2020. The R according to the start date of the effect of preventive measures was estimated. RESULTS: The estimated R in Hubei Province, China, was 4.0281, whereas the estimated initial R in Korea was 0.555, but later in Daegu/NGP, the value was between 3.472 and 3.543. When the transmission period decreases from 4-day to 2-day, the outbreak ends early, but the peak of the epidemic increases, and the total number of patients does not change greatly. It was found that, if transmission rate decreases, the outbreak ends early, and the size of the peak and the total number of patients also decreases. CONCLUSIONS: To end the COVID-19 epidemic, efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, such as social distancing and wearing masks, are absolutely crucial with the participation of the public, along with the policy of reducing the transmission period by finding and isolating patients as quickly as possible through the efforts of the quarantine authorities.","Choi, Sunhwa; Ki, Moran",Epidemiol Health,,209

METHODS: An exhaustive search of the PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, LitCovid NIH, and WHO COVID-19 database was conducted through August 6th, 2020. All studies reporting the prevalence of ""loss of smell"" (anosmia and/or hyposmia/microsmia) in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. Pooled prevalence for cases (positive COVID-19 through reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) and/or serology IgG/IgM) and controls (negative RT-PCR and/or serology) was compared, and the odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and the p-value were calculated. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 51 studies with 11074 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. Of these, 21 studies used a control group with 3425 patients. The symptom of ""loss of smell"" (OR: 14.7, CI: 8.9-24.3) was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group when compared to the control group. Seven studies comparing severe COVID-19 patients with- and without ""loss of smell"" demonstrated favorable prognosis for patients with ""loss of smell"" (OR: 0.36, CI 0.27-0.48). CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory dysfunction or ""loss of smell"" is a prevalent symptom in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, COVID-19 patients with ""loss of smell"" appear to have a milder course of the disease.","Aziz, Muhammad; Goyal, Hemant; Haghbin, Hossein; Lee-Smith, Wade M; Gajendran, Mahesh; Perisetti, Abhilash",Am. j. med. sci,,209

The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of thermoplastic mask immobilization with a surgical mask using an ExacTrac system. Twelve patients each with brain metastases were immobilized using a thermoplastic mask and a surgical mask and only a thermoplastic mask. Two x-ray images were acquired to correct (XC) and verify (XV) the patient's position at a couch angle of 0°. Subsequently, the XC and XV images were acquired at each planned couch angle for non-coplanar beams. When the position errors were detected after couch rotation for non-coplanar beams, the errors were corrected at each planned couch angle until a clinically acceptable tolerance was attained. The position errors in the translational and rotational directions (vertical, lateral, longitudinal, pitch, roll, and yaw) were retrospectively investigated using data from the ExacTrac system database. A standard deviation of XC translational and rotational position errors with and without a surgical mask in the lateral (1.52 vs 2.07 mm), longitudinal (1.59 vs 1.87 mm), vertical (1.00 vs 1.73 mm), pitch (0.99 vs 0.79°), roll (1.24 vs 0.68°), and yaw (1.58 vs 0.90°) directions were observed at a couch angle of 0°. Most of patient positioning errors were less than 1.0 mm or 1.0° after the couch was rotated to the planned angle for non-coplanar beams. The overall absolute values of the translational and rotational XV position errors with and without the surgical mask were less than 0.5 mm and 0.5°, respectively. This study showed that a thermoplastic mask with a surgical mask is a feasible immobilization technique for brain SRS/SRT patients using the ExacTrac system.","Miura, Hideharu; Hioki, Kazunari; Ozawa, Shuichi; Kanemoto, Kenji; Nakao, Minoru; Doi, Yoshiko; Kenjo, Masahiko; Nagata, Yasushi",J Appl Clin Med Phys,,209

Identification of known and approved drugs against novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) seems to be an urgent need for the repurposing of the existing drugs. So, here we examined a safe strategy of using approved drugs of SuperDRUG2 database against modeled membrane protein (M-protein) of SARS-CoV-2 which is essential for virus assembly by using molecular docking-based virtual screening. A total of 3639 drugs from SuperDRUG2 database and additionally 14 potential drugs reported against COVID-19 proteins were selected. Molecular docking analyses revealed that nine drugs can bind the active site of M-protein with desirable molecular interactions. We therefore applied molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculation using MM-PBSA to analyze the stability of the compounds. The complexes of M-protein with the selected drugs were simulated for 50 ns and ranked according to their binding free energies. The binding mode of the drugs with M-protein was analyzed and it was observed that Colchicine, Remdesivir, Bafilomycin A1 from COVID-19 suggested drugs and Temozolomide from SuperDRUG2 database displayed desirable molecular interactions and higher binding affinity towards M-protein. Interestingly, Colchicine was found as the top most binder among tested drugs against M-protein. We therefore additionally identified four Colchicine derivatives which can bind efficiently with M-protein and have better pharmacokinetic properties. We recommend that these drugs can be tested further through in vitro studies against SARS-CoV-2 M-protein.","Peele, K Abraham; Kumar, Vikas; Parate, Shraddha; Srirama, Krupanidhi; Lee, Keun Woo; Venkateswarulu, T C",J. pharm. sci,,209

The present study evaluated whether the higher order structure of MMPI-3 scales, and in particular, the 26 Specific Problems as well as RC6 and RC8 (markers of thought disorder) scales aligned with the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) model. For this purpose, a large diverse mental health sample (n = 1,537) and a male prison inmate sample (n = 452) were used to capture a diverse range of psychopathology. Confirmatory factor analyses generally supported the six HiTOP spectra in both samples, albeit with some important qualifications. Associations between latent factor scores and conceptually relevant external criterion measures further supported the validity of this model. Furthermore, Goldberg's sequential hierarchical factoring approach was used to evaluate the structure of MMPI-3 SP and RC6/RC8 at descending levels of the hierarchy. Again, most of the HiTOP spectra were replicated. The structures for the mental health and prison samples were generally similar with substantive differences being linked to their respective contexts. Overall, the results indicate that the hierarchical organization of the MMPI-3 scales is generally consistent with the extant psychopathology literature, which constitutes good support for overall construct validity of the scales.

All the obtained guidelines were studied and the contents were summarized. During the COVID-19 pandemic, early stage endometrial cancer was preferably treated with hormone therapy while radiotherapy was given in preference in later stages. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions should be treated immediately after diagnosis using at least a loop electrosurgical excision procedure while any major surgery should be postponed by 10-12 weeks. In the early stage of cervical cancer, surgery may be delayed by 2-4 weeks, and radiotherapy prescribed for the intervening period. In cases of an ovarian mass with negative tumor markers, no sign of cancer on imaging investigations, no ascites, a low serum CA-125 level, and no papillary projection or vegetation in the base of the cyst, the patient may be given hormone therapy for 2-3 months. In cases of newly diagnosed confirmed ovarian cancers, surgery should be performed as early as possible (maximum: 2-3 weeks). Vulvar and vaginal cancers can be treated within 10-12 weeks of diagnosis, but radiotherapy should be given in preference in this situation. A molar pregnancy is an oncological emergency for which a suction curettage is mandatory; the patient must be monitored for metastases. Information concerning the choice between open or laparoscopic surgery is limited. Given that any patient may be an asymptomatic carrier of the coronavirus, major surgery should be preceded by chest computerized tomography, with and without contrast medium, in order to detect lung lesions. Evidence concerning these recommendations is limited because of the novel and unknown nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, data pertaining to ethical debates about delayed treatment and treatment approaches deviating from current guidelines are also limited.","Alkatout, Ibrahim; Karimi-Zarchi, Mojgan; Allahqoli, Leila",J Turk Ger Gynecol Assoc,,209

We studied the impact of COVID-19 on acute stroke care in our health system serving Southeast Michigan as we rolled out a policy to limit admissions and transfers. METHODS: in this retrospective study conducted at two stroke centers, we included consecutive patients presenting to the ED for whom a stroke alert was activated during the period extending from 3/20/20 to 5/20/20 and a similar period in 2019. We compared demographics, time metrics, and discharge outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS: of 385 patients presented to the ED during the two time periods, 58% were African American. There was a significant decrease in the number of stroke patients presenting to the ED and admitted to the hospital between the two periods (p <0.001). In 2020, patients had higher presenting NIHSS (median: 2 vs 5, p = 0.012), discharge NIHSS (median: 2 vs 3, p = 0.004), and longer times from LKW to ED arrival (4.8 vs 9.4 h, p = 0.031) and stroke team activation (median: 10 vs 15 min, p = 0.006). In 2020, stroke mimics rates were lower among African Americans. There were fewer hospitalizations (p <0.001), and transfers from outside facilities (p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: a trend toward faster stroke care in the ED was observed during the pandemic along with dramatically reduced numbers of ED visits, hospitalizations and stroke mimics. Delayed ED presentations and higher stroke severity characterized the African American population, highlighting deepening of racial disparities during the pandemic.","Aboul Nour, Hassan; Affan, Muhammad; Mohamed, Ghada; Mohamud, Ali; Schultz, Lonni; Latack, Katie; Brady, Megan; Scozzari, Dawn; Haddad, Yazeed; Katramados, Angelos; Bou Chebl, Alex; Ramadan, Ahmad Riad",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,209

During viral replication mTOR, downstream target genes such as ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta 1 (S6K1) and Eukaryotic translational initiation factor 4E-binding protein1 (4-E-BP1) are activated result in ribosome biosynthesis and efficient protein synthesis. In plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), mTOR plays a key role in the association of adapter protein myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF-7) leading to the transcriptional activation of type-I interferon (IFN) genes. Viruses also inactivate the interferon α (IFN-α) pathway by impairing the IRF-7 mediated activation of IFN-α gene transcription. Thus, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors can help in suppressing the early stages of viral infection and replication. Interestingly, the key tumor-suppressor p53 protein will undergo degradation by virus-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase Ring-finger and CHY zinc-finger domain-containing 1 (RCHY1) leading to an increased viral survival in host cells. Thus, the mTOR inhibitors and p53 activators or microRNAs that functions as p53 and can target 3′-UTR of mTOR and RPS6KB1 might effectively inhibit viral replication in the human respiratory tract and lung cells.","Ramaiah, Mekala Janaki",Gene Rep.,,209

Aim: The aim of the study is to assess cyberchondria and its association with depression, anxiety, stress, and quality of life (QOL) in dental students during the pandemic. Materials and Methods: An online questionnaire-based survey was carried out on dental students. The survey tool comprised a semi-structured pro forma, General Health Questionnaire-12, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21, Cyberchondria Severity Scale 15, and European Health Interview Survey QOL 8. Results: The study revealed that 98.7% of the students were affected by one of the constructs of cyberchondria, viz., ""excessiveness"" (93.7%), followed by ""distress"" (84.3%) and ""reassurance""-seeking behavior (83.7%). Cyberchondria affected girls more than boys and shared robust positive correlation with depression, anxiety, and stress but not QOL. Factors such as stress, anxiety, QOL, and changes in appetite were associated with higher severity of depression. Family financial losses, preexisting psychiatric illness, and media adverse effect shared robust positive associations with severity of depression, anxiety, and stress and an inverse association with QOL. 76.0% of the students expressed excessive worries regarding missing out on clinical exposure, and nearly half of the students were dissatisfied with eLearning. 78.3% of the students experienced changes in sleep;68.7% had changes in appetite;and 89.0% reported reduction in the level of physical activity.

New drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are in urgent need. Considering the long development time for new drugs, the identification of promising inhibitors from FDA-approved drugs is an imperative and valuable strategy. Recent studies have shown that the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 utilize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the receptor to infect human cells. METHODS: We combined molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to identify potential inhibitors for ACE2 from available commercial medicines. We also designed coronavirus pseudoparticles that contain the spike protein assembled onto green fluorescent protein or luciferase reporter gene-carrying vesicular stomatitis virus core particles. RESULTS: We found that thymoquinone, a phytochemical compound obtained from the plant Nigella sativa, is a potential drug candidate. SPR analysis confirmed the binding of thymoquinone to ACE2. We found that thymoquinone can inhibit SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and NL63 pseudoparticles infecting HEK293-ACE2 cells, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 4.999, 7.598, and 6.019 µM, respectively.

305804,Pos-543 Experience of Covid 19 Disease on 159 Ecuadorian Chronic Dialysis Patients,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a zoonotic coronavirus that crossed species to infect humans, causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Despite a potentially higher risk of pregnant women acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the non-pregnant population (particularly in some ethnic minorities), no additional specific recommendations to avoid exposure are needed in pregnancy. The most common clinical symptoms and laboratory signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy are fever, cough, lymphopenia and elevated C-reactive protein levels. Pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the non-pregnant population, including pneumonia, admission to the intensive care unit and death, even after adjusting for potential risk factors for severe outcomes. The risk of miscarriage does not appear to be increased in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evidence with regards to preterm birth and perinatal mortality is conflicting, but these risks are generally higher only in symptomatic, hospitalized women. The risk of vertical transmission, defined as the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the mother to the fetus or the newborn, is generally low. Fetal invasive procedures are considered to be generally safe in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, although the evidence is still limited. In pregnant women with COVID-19, use of steroids should not be avoided if clinically indicated; the preferred regimen is a 2-day course of dexamethasone followed by an 8-day course of methylprednisolone. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be used if there are no contraindications. Hospitalized pregnant women with severe COVID-19 should undergo thromboprophylaxis throughout the duration of hospitalization and at least until discharge, preferably with low molecular weight heparin. Hospitalized women who have recovered from a period of serious or critical illness with COVID-19 should be offered a fetal growth scan about 14 days after recovery from their illness. In asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic women who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at full term (i.e. &#8805; 39 weeks of gestation), induction of labor might be reasonable. To date, there is no clear consensus on the optimal timing of delivery for critically ill women. In women with no or few symptoms, management of labor should follow routine evidence-based guidelines. Regardless of COVID-19 status, mothers and their infants should remain together and breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact, kangaroo mother care and rooming-in throughout the day and night should be practiced, while applying necessary infection prevention and control measures. Many pregnant women have already undergone vaccination, mostly in the USA where the first reports show no significant difference in pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccination during pregnancy compared with the background risk. Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in the umbilical cord blood and breast milk samples of pregnant and lactating women who received the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Based on the available limited data on the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine in pregnancy, it seems reasonable to offer the option of vaccination to pregnant women after accurate counseling on the potential risk of a severe course of the disease and the unknown risk of fetal exposure to the vaccine. © 2021 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.","Di Mascio, D; Buca, D; Berghella, V; Khalil, A; Rizzo, G; Odibo, A; Saccone, G; Galindo, A; Liberati, M; D039,; Antonio, F",Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol,,209

METHODOLOGY: Doctors' anonymised demographic and staff sickness data were collected between 16 March and 26 April 2020, corresponding with the single centre's greatest COVID-19 caseload. FINDINGS: 128 (39%) of doctors experienced at least one sickness episode. Episodes totalled 1,240 days, equating to a sickness absence rate of 9.1%. Rates varied between departments and grades. High levels of sickness were seen in medicine and both adult and paediatric emergency departments with the lowest levels seen in intensive care. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 caused a burden of sickness on the medical workforce which must be accounted for in future workforce planning. The disparity in sickness rates across departments is likely to be multi-factorial. Further study is needed to investigate these factors to protect healthcare staff and their patients.","Khorasanee, Reza; Grundy, Tomas; Isted, Alexander; Breeze, Richard",Clin Med (Lond),,209

However, perhaps because of inadequate tools for matrix exponentiation in programming languages commonly used amongst statisticians or a belief that the necessary calculations are prohibitively expensive, statistical inference for continuous-time Markov chains with a large but finite state space is typically conducted via particle MCMC or other relatively complex inference schemes. When, as in many applications $\mathsf{Q}$ arises from a reaction network, it is usually sparse. We describe variations on known algorithms which allow fast, robust and accurate evaluation of the product of a non-negative vector with the exponential of a large, sparse rate matrix. Our implementation uses relatively recently developed, efficient, linear algebra tools that take advantage of such sparsity. We demonstrate the straightforward statistical application of the key algorithm on a model for the mixing of two alleles in a population and on the Susceptible-Infectious-Removed epidemic model.","Sherlock, Chris",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07110v2.pdf,209

METHODS: This retrospective study from a University tertiary care hospital in northern Italy, included hospitalized adult patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 between 25 February 2020 and 25 March 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 317 individuals were enrolled. Their median age was 71 years and 67.2% were male (213/317). The most common underlying diseases were hypertension (149/317; 47.0%), cardiovascular disease (63/317; 19.9%) and diabetes (49/317; 15.5%). Common symptoms at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis included fever (285/317; 89.9%), shortness of breath (167/317; 52.7%) and dry cough (156/317; 49.2%). An 'atypical' presentation including at least one among mental confusion, diarrhoea or nausea and vomiting was observed in 53/317 patients (16.7%). Hypokalaemia occurred in 25.8% (78/302) and 18.5% (56/303) had acute kidney injury. During hospitalization, 111/317 patients (35.0%) received non-invasive respiratory support, 65/317 (20.5%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 60/317 (18.5%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. All-cause in-hospital mortality, assessed in 275 patients, was 43.6% (120/275). On multivariable analysis, age (per-year increase OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.04-1.10; p < 0.001), cardiovascular disease (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.07-6.25; p 0.03), and C-reactive protein levels (per-point increase OR 1.009; 95% CI 1.004-1.014; p 0.001) were independent risk factors for all-cause in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 mainly affected elderly patients with predisposing conditions and caused severe illness, frequently requiring non-invasive respiratory support or ICU admission. Despite supportive care, COVID-19 remains associated with a substantial risk of all-cause in-hospital mortality.","Vena, Antonio; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto; Di Biagio, Antonio; Mikulska, Malgorzata; Taramasso, Lucia; De Maria, Andrea; Ball, Lorenzo; Brunetti, Iole; Loconte, Maurizio; Patroniti, Nicolò A; Robba, Chiara; Delfino, Emanuele; Dentone, Chiara; Magnasco, Laura; Nicolini, Laura; Toscanini, Federica; Bavastro, Martina; Cerchiaro, Matteo; Barisione, Emanuela; Giacomini, Mauro; Mora, Sara; Baldi, Federico; Balletto, Elisa; Berruti, Marco; Briano, Federica; Sepulcri, Chiara; Dettori, Silvia; Labate, Laura; Mirabella, Michele; Portunato, Federica; Pincino, Rachele; Russo, Chiara; Tutino, Stefania; Pelosi, Paolo; Bassetti, Matteo",Clin Microbiol Infect,,209

Currently, the prevention and control of spread are the goals in COVID-19 management as there are no specific drugs to cure or vaccines available for prevention. Hence, the drug repurposing was explored by many research groups, and many target proteins have been examined. The major protease (M pro), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) are two target proteins in SARS-CoV-2 that have been validated and extensively studied for drug development in COVID-19. The RdRp shares a high degree of homology between those of two previously known coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Methods: In this study, the FDA approved library of drugs were docked against the active site of RdRp using Schrodinger's computer-aided drug discovery tools for in silico drug-repurposing. Results: We have shortlisted 14 drugs from the Standard Precision docking and interaction-wise study of drug-binding with the active site on the enzyme. These drugs are antibiotics, NSAIDs, hypolipidemic, coagulant, thrombolytic, and anti-allergics. In molecular dynamics simulations, pitavastatin, ridogrel and rosoxacin displayed superior binding with the active site through ARG555 and divalent magnesium. Conclusion: Pitavastatin, ridogrel and rosoxacin can be further optimized in preclinical and clinical studies to determine their possible role in COVID-19 treatment.","Baby, Krishnaprasad; Maity, Swastika; Mehta, Chetan H; Suresh, Akhil; Nayak, Usha Y; Nayak, Yogendra",F1000Res,,209

315170,"Role of biomaterials in the diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and study of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19)",2021,"Purpose: This conceptual paper aims to provide a further understanding of the impact of economic policy uncertainty (EPU), news framing and information overload on panic buying behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on earlier research and news releases about the COVID-19 outbreak, this paper advances testable propositions based on the protection motivation theory and information processing theory. Findings: This paper infers that the major shift in consumer decision-making towards panic buying is a result of high EPU. International reports have contributed to deepening this uncertainty, and the consequences of this EPU are expected to affect the economic recovery through 2022. Furthermore, the adoption of particular frames of the pandemic has played a key role in the dissemination of misinformation and fake news during the public health crisis and affected purchasing decisions. The study also infers that the perceived threat among consumers is driven by information overload as a source of mistrust towards economic and health information sources. Originality/value: This paper addresses two theoretical gaps associated with consumer buying behaviour. First, it highlights the impact of EPU, as a macroeconomic indicator, on consumer buying behaviour. Second, this paper is an attempt to integrate theories from different disciplines to foster an adequate understanding of buying behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak period. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Aljanabi, A.

316757,Towards Optimization of Hydroxychloroquine Dosing in Intensive Care Unit COVID-19 Patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health innovations are well adapted for ambulatory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients who risk clinical deterioration at home during the second week of illness. METHODS: A short message service (SMS) communication program was implemented by French physicians to monitor COVID-19 patients after discharge from outpatient or emergency care. The aim of the SMS tracking is to advise patients about their need for medical reassessment if reporting worsening of COVID-19 symptoms. A follow-up via SMS to all confirmed positive patients in the Nîmes area (France) was established. Every morning, patients received four follow-up questions. Daily responses were converted to green, orange or red trees, analysed in real time by physicians. ""Red"" patients were called immediately to check their condition and organise transfer to hospital if needed. ""Orange"" patients were called within two hours to verify whether the specific instructions following the SMS had been followed. RESULTS: From March 21 to June 30, 2020, 1007 patients agreed to sign up to the SMS tracking, 62% were women and the mean age was 41.5 years (standard deviation (SD) 16.0). During follow-up, 649 (64%) became ""orange"" and 69 (7%) ""red"". Ten patients were directly admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department during their follow-up due to clinical worsening, all but one as a result of SMS alerts and subsequent telephone assessment by physicians. CONCLUSION: SMS tracking platforms could be useful as an early warning system to refer patients with worsening clinical status to hospital-based care or additional clinician advice.","Loubet, Paul; Czeschan, Christian; Sintes, Matthieu; Sotto, Albert; Laureillard, Didier",BMC Med,,209
316977,Cutaneous manifestations of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A brief review,2020,"While the vaccination efforts against SARS-CoV-2 infections are ongoing worldwide, new genetic variants of the virus are emerging and spreading. Following the initial surges of the Alpha (B.1.1.7) and the Beta (B.1.351) variants, a more infectious Delta variant (B.1.617.2) is now surging, further deepening the health crises caused by the pandemic. The sharp rise in cases attributed to the Delta variant has made it especially disturbing and is a variant of concern. Fortunately, current vaccines offer protection against known variants of concern, including the Delta variant. However, the Delta variant has exhibited some ability to dodge the immune system as it is found that neutralizing antibodies from prior infections or vaccines are less receptive to binding with the Delta spike protein. Here, we investigated the structural changes caused by the mutations in the Delta variants receptor-binding interface and explored the effects on binding with the ACE2 receptor as well as with neutralizing antibodies. We find that the receptor-binding {beta}-loop-{beta} motif adopts an altered but stable conformation causing separation in some of the antibody binding epitopes. Our study shows reduced binding of neutralizing antibodies and provides a possible mechanism for the immune evasion exhibited by the Delta variant.","Baral, Prabin; Bhattarai, Nisha; Hossen, Md Lokman; Stebliankin, Vitalii; Gerstman, Bernard; Narasimhan, Giri; Chapagain, Prem P",,,209
317173,Clinician Opinions and Approaches to Manage Risk Related to Safe Sleep During Skin-to-Skin Care,2020,"Since the COVID-19 pandemic onset, the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 has been extensively characterized. Antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein are frequently encoded by IGHV3-53/3-66 with a short complementarity-determining region (CDR) H3. Germline-encoded sequence motifs in heavy chain CDRs H1 and H2 have a major function, but whether any common motifs are present in CDR H3, which is often critical for binding specificity, is not clear. Here, we identify two public clonotypes of IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies with a 9-residue CDR H3 that pair with different light chains. Distinct sequence motifs on CDR H3 are present in the two public clonotypes that seem to be related to differential light chain pairing. Additionally, we show that Y58F is a common somatic hypermutation that results in increased binding affinity of IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies with a short CDR H3. These results advance understanding of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2.","Tan, Timothy J C; Yuan, Meng; Kuzelka, Kaylee; Padron, Gilberto C; Beal, Jacob R; Chen, Xin; Wang, Yiquan; Rivera-Cardona, Joel; Zhu, Xueyong; Stadtmueller, Beth M; Brooke, Christopher B; Wilson, Ian A; Wu, Nicholas C",Nat Commun,,209

AIM: This study aims to identify changes in lag screw position and Tip Apex Distance (TAD) in dynamic hip screw fixation due to changes in practice during the coronavirus pandemic and determine whether the changes resulted in improved patient outcomes and enhanced training opportunities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of two patient cohorts - pre-covid (n=27) and during covid (n=26) - to evaluate the TAD and lag screw position for each patient and record the grade of operating surgeon. A total of 53 patients were included. RESULTS: A mean TAD of 19.78mm and 19.80mm was calculated for cohort 1 and 2 respectively with no significant difference identified. When considering both key risk factors for lag screw cut-out (lag screw position and TAD) the number of patients with both a ""satisfactory position"" of the screw and a TAD &lt;20mm, were 8/27 (29.6%) and 11/26 (42.3%), respectively. In cohort 1 3/27 cases had a consultant documented as the primary surgeon, while no consultants were documented as being present for the remaining 24 cases. 21/26 cases in cohort 2 had a consultant present some capacity, either as primary surgeon (15/21) or assistant (6/21). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in practice due to the pandemic have had some positive effects for both patients and trainees. This study has highlighted the importance of Consultant led trauma lists for improving training and surgical outcomes with a demonstrated improvement when considering both key factors associated with screw cut-out together. Ultimately some of the changes in practice should be continued in the post-covid era.","Barlow, E.; Larsen, M. P.; Vijayasurej, K.; Burczy, M.; Burczy, J.; Mullins, M.",Pol Merkur Lekarski,,209
320521,Mental health of college students of different specialties during the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019,2021,"Hospitals around the world, as health institutions with a key role in the health system, face problems while providing health services to patients with various types of diseases. Currently, those problems are intensified due to the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. This pandemic has caused an extreme spread of the disease with constantly changing needs of patients which impacts the capacities and overall functioning of hospitals. In order to meet the challenge of the COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease- 2019) pandemic, health systems must adjust to new circumstances and establish separate hospitals exclusive for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. In the process of creating COVID-19 hospitals, health systems face a shortage of medical professionals trained for work in COVID-19 hospitals. Using this as a starting point, this study puts forward a two-phase model for the evaluation and selection of nurses for COVID-19 hospitals. Each phase of the model features a separate multiple-criteria model. In the first phase, a multiple-criteria model with a dominant criterion is formed and candidates who meet the defined requirements are evaluated. In the second phase, a modified multiple-criteria model is formed and used to evaluate medical professionals who do not meet the requirements of the dominant criterion. By applying this model, two groups of medical professionals are defined: 1) medical professionals who completely meet the requirements for working in COVID-19 hospitals and 2) medical professionals who require additional training. The criteria for evaluation of medical professionals in this multiple-criteria model are defined based on research conducted on medical professionals assigned to the COVID-19 Crisis Response Team during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Serbia. The model was tested on a real example of evaluating medical professionals assigned to the COVID-19 hospital in Sombor. The model for evaluating medical professionals presented in this paper can help decision makers in hospitals and national policy makers to determine the readiness level of hospitals for working in the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as underline the areas in which hospitals are not ready to meet the challenges of the pandemic. © 2020 Regional Association for Security and crisis management.

METHODS: Patient data for a three-week period was prospectively collected for ESU patients during lockdown period and compared to the ESU workload for the same time period prior to lockdown. RESULTS: Surgical emergencies admissions reduced by 2.5 times during our study period (p value = 0.001). In this changed paradigm, the overall number of surgical emergencies were reduced. A high mortality (n = 4, 5.7%) was noted during lockdown period as compared to pre-lockdown period (n = 1, 0.58%, p value = 0.025). Almost half of surgical admissions were tested for COVID-19 based on their symptoms and more than third (n=14, 38.9%) of them were positive. Gastrointestinal symptoms were common in COVID-19 positive group (85.7%) and only a third (36%) of COVID-19 positive patients needed surgical attention. Chest x-ray findings were comparable to PCR testing in terms of sensitivity and specificity but CT chest was more sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: It remains unclear how COVID-19 reduced surgical emergencies.

The COVID-19 pandemic is unique in comparison to prior coronavirus epidemics in its superior ability to be spread by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients allowing the virus to silently evade traditional symptoms-based screening approaches. Countries have implemented cutting-edge digital solutions to enhance traditional contact tracing methodologies in combination with novel testing strategies to combat the virus with variable levels of success. Despite having one of the most advanced and expensive health care systems in the world, the United States (U.S.) response is arguably one of the world's largest failures as it leads the globe in case number as well as deaths. Until a successful vaccine can be broadly distributed, it is imperative the U.S. curbs the viral spread by rapidly developing a framework implementing both enhanced tracing and testing strategies balancing the needs of public health while respecting individual liberties. This review will explore the role of technology augmented contact-based surveillance in tracking the outbreak in select countries in comparison to the current U.S. approach. It will evaluate barriers in the US to implementing similar technologies focusing on privacy concerns and a lack of unified testing and tracing strategy. Finally, it will explore strategies for rapidly scaling testing in a cost-effective manner.","Skoll, D; Miller, J C; Saxon, L A",,,209

METHODS: US transplant recipients were recruited into this prospective cohort study through social media; those who completed the full vaccine series between 12/9/2020-3/1/2021 were included. We collected demographics, medical history, and safety information within 7 days after doses 1 and 2 (D1, D2). Associations between characteristics and reactions were evaluated using modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: We studied 741 transplant recipients who underwent BNT162b2 (54%) or mRNA-1273 (46%) vaccination. Median (IQR) age was 60 (44-69) years, 57% were female, and 10% were nonwhite. While local site reactions decreased after D2 (85% D1 vs. 78% D2, p<0.001), systemic reactions increased (49% D1 vs. 69% D2, p<0.001). Younger participants were more likely to develop systemic symptoms after D1 (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] per 10 years= 0.850.900.94, p<0.001) and D2 (aIRR per 10 years= 0.910.930.96, p<0.001). Participants who experienced pain (aIRR= 1.111.662.47, p=0.01) or redness (aIRR= 1.833.928.41, p<0.01) were more likely to develop an antibody response to D1 of mRNA vaccines. No anaphylaxis, neurologic diagnoses, or SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses were reported. Infections were minimal (3% after D1, <0.01% after D2). One patient reported incident acute rejection post D2. CONCLUSIONS: In SOTRs undergoing mRNA vaccination, reactogenicity was similar to that reported in the original trials. Severe reactions were rare. These early safety data may help address vaccine hesitancy in transplant recipients.","Ou, Michael T; Boyarsky, Brian J; Motter, Jennifer D; Greenberg, Ross S; Teles, Aura T; Ruddy, Jake A; Krach, Michelle R; Jain, Vedant S; Werbel, William A; Avery, Robin K; Massie, Allan B; Segev, Dorry L; Garonzik-Wang, Jacqueline M",Transplantation,,209
325806,Coronavirus Disease 2019 During Pregnancy: A Systematic Review of Reported Cases,2020,"In an earlier paper we proposed a recursive model for epidemics; in the present paper we generalize this model to include the asymptomatic or unrecorded symptomatic people, which we call {\em dark people} (dark sector). We call this the SEPAR$_d$-model. A delay differential equation version of the model is added; it allows a better comparison to other models. We carry this out by a comparison with the classical SIR model and indicate why we believe that the SEPAR$_d$ model may work better for Covid-19 than other approaches. In the second part of the paper we explain how to deal with the data provided by the JHU, in particular we explain how to derive central model parameters from the data. Other parameters, like the size of the dark sector, are less accessible and have to be estimated more roughly, at best by results of representative serological studies which are accessible, however, only for a few countries. We start our country studies with Switzerland where such data are available. Then we apply the model to a collection of other countries, three European ones (Germany, France, Sweden), the three most stricken countries from three other continents (USA, Brazil, India). Finally we show that even the aggregated world data can be well represented by our approach. At the end of the paper we discuss the use of the model. Perhaps the most striking application is that it allows a quantitative analysis of the influence of the time until people are sent to quarantine or hospital.

The MD has been connected with the number of sensor nodes required in several applications, including diffusion source detection, navigation and pattern matching. In this paper, we study how much the MD can change if we add a single edge to the graph. We find that the MD cannot decrease by more than two, however, there are examples where the increase can be very large. We believe that such a large increase can occur only in specially constructed graphs. For two simple families of graphs - ring graphs and grid graphs - we show that the increase of the MD cannot be larger than two either. For grid graphs, when the extra edge is sampled uniformly randomly, we almost completely characterize the limiting distribution of the MD.","Mashkaria, Satvik; 'Odor, Gergely; Thiran, Patrick",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11023v1.pdf,209

Accordingly, it is a vital process to detect positive cases at an early stage for treatment and controlling the disease from spreading. Several medical tests had been applied for COVID-19 detection in certain injuries, but with limited efficiency. In this study, a new COVID-19 diagnosis strategy called Feature Correlated Naïve Bayes (FCNB) has been introduced. The FCNB consists of four phases, which are; Feature Selection Phase (FSP), Feature Clustering Phase (FCP), Master Feature Weighting Phase (MFWP), and Feature Correlated Naïve Bayes Phase (FCNBP). The FSP selects only the most effective features among the extracted features from laboratory tests for both COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 people by using the Genetic Algorithm as a wrapper method. The FCP constructs many clusters of features based on the selected features from FSP by using a novel clustering technique. These clusters of features are called Master Features (MFs) in which each MF contains a set of dependent features. The MFWP assigns a weight value to each MF by using a new weight calculation method. The FCNBP is used to classify patients based on the weighted Naïve Bayes algorithm with many modifications as the correlation between features. The proposed FCNB strategy has been compared to recent competitive techniques. Experimental results have proven the effectiveness of the FCNB strategy in which it outperforms recent competitive techniques because it achieves the maximum (99%) detection accuracy.","Mansour, Nehal A; Saleh, Ahmed I; Badawy, Mahmoud; Ali, Hesham A",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,,209

However, standardized and harmonized workflows, e.g. for DNA extraction, are required to ensure robust and exchangeable WGS data. Data sharing between (inter)national laboratories is essential to support foodborne pathogen control, including outbreak investigation. This study evaluated eight commercial DNA preparation kits for their potential influence on: (i) DNA quality for Nextera XT library preparation; (ii) MiSeq sequencing (data quality, read mapping against plasmid and chromosome references); and (iii) WGS data analysis, i.e. isolate characterization (serotyping, virulence and antimicrobial resistance genotyping) and phylogenetic relatedness (core genome multilocus sequence typing and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis). Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) was selected as a case study. Overall, data quality and inferred phylogenetic relationships between isolates were not affected by the DNA extraction kit choice, irrespective of the presence of confounding factors such as EDTA in DNA solution buffers. Nevertheless, completeness of STEC characterization was, although not substantially, influenced by the plasmid extraction performance of the kits, especially when using Nextera XT library preparation. This study contributes to addressing the WGS challenges of standardizing protocols to support data portability and to enable full exploitation of its potential.","Nouws, Stéphanie; Bogaerts, Bert; Verhaegen, Bavo; Denayer, Sarah; Piérard, Denis; Marchal, Kathleen; Roosens, Nancy H C; Vanneste, Kevin; De Keersmaecker, Sigrid C J",Sci Rep,,209

332330,The Response of the Government's Emergency System to the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in China: A Retrospective Comparative Study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Diarrhoea remains a public health problem and an important cause of morbidity and mortality amongst children, mainly in low- and middle-income countries. In Namibia, the national prevalence of diarrhoea was 17%; it was responsible for 5% of all deaths in children under 5 years old and is the second leading cause of death. AIM: The purpose of this study was to assess the epidemiology and factors associated with acute diarrhoea amongst children less than 5 years of age in Engela district in the Ohangwena region, Namibia. SETTING: The study was conducted in Ohangwena Region in Namibia which extends east to west along the borders of the southern part of Angola. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted. A structured questionnaire was administered through face-to-face interviews. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the socio-demographic and epidemiological data of diarrhoea and logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with the prevalence of diarrhoea. RESULTS: The study found a prevalence of 23.8% for diarrhoea in the 2 weeks period preceding the survey amongst children aged under 5 years. The prevalence of diarrhoea was statistically significantly associated with children (p 0.05). The strongest predictor of the prevalence of diarrhoea was the residential area 'informal settlement', with an odds ratio of 36.42. This implies that children living in the informal settlement are 36.42 times at risk of contracting diarrhoea as compared to those living in other residential areas. CONCLUSION: epidemiology; factors; diarrhoea; under-5 years children; Engela district; Ohangwena region; Namibia.","Bauleth, Maria F; Mitonga, Honore K; Pinehas, Lusia N",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,,209

About as much as we know about the virus itself, which is that it is universal, it is catastrophic, and it is forcing us to bend and shift in ways we never expected. We don't yet know the full impact of COVID-19 on camps, although preliminary findings from a series of studies conducted by the American Camp Association suggest the effects of COVID-19 on camps and the communities they serve are significant. In this research note we present what we are learning from these ongoing efforts and what they suggest about camps and the young people they serve. While programmatic shifts, like virtual camp programming, and COVID-19 preventive measures, like masks and cohorts, are still being tested, we know that young people thrive when they feel connected to peers and adults in places like camp. We also know that coronavirus disproportionately affects communities who already face inequitable access to healthcare, education, and high-quality summertime experiences. Given what we know, and considering what we have yet to learn, we suggest some ways camp professionals and researchers can chart a path to 2021.","Browne, L.; Wycoff, T.",Journal of Outdoor Recreation Education and Leadership,,209

On the other hand, coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has determined a dramatic worldwide reconfiguration of the healthcare systems, with rapid redeployment of resources towards this emergency. Italy was the first Western country affected by a large-scale spread of coronavirus disease 2019. The aim of our study is to analyse the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on in-hospital care of patients with CHD in an Italian tertiary centre. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively reviewed data on CHD hospital admissions in our centre since 1 March, 2020, when the adoption of a strict infection containment policy throughout the country resulted in limited access of patients to routine hospital care and resources reallocation to the care of infected patients. Comparison with data from the previous year was performed in order to identify any relevant differences attributable to the outbreak. Despite cancellation of all elective procedures, the overall number of urgent hospital admission remained stable throughout the period of study. Patients admitted during the pandemic had greater disease complexity (p = 0.001) with longer length of in-hospital stay (p = 0.01). No adverse events or positive swabs were reported among CHD patients who were admitted to hospital or medical personnel caring for these patients. CONCLUSION: Data from our early experience suggest that coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic did not impact significantly on the provision of urgent care to adult patients with CHD.","Scognamiglio, Giancarlo; Fusco, Flavia; Merola, Assunta; Palma, Michela; Correra, Anna; Sarubbi, Berardo",Cardiol Young,,209

336064,Neurological involvement of coronavirus disease 2019: a systematic review,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised unprecedented challenges in the management of patients with cancer and has increased the demands for digital health tools that, for example, could facilitate remote monitoring of patients. Based on this, the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adulto (GIMEMA) has recently developed a digital health tool dedicated to patients with hematologic malignancies: the GIMEMA-ALLIANCE platform. OBJECTIVE: The main objectives of this web-based platform are to generate relevant data to better understand quality of life, symptoms, and medication adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic and postpandemic era; to develop a prospective real-life registry on outcomes of patients with hematologic cancer, with or without a diagnosis of COVID-19; and to facilitate patient-centered care in routine practice. METHODS: The platform consists of physician- and patient-secure portals and enables electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) assessments with real-time graphical presentation to physicians of individual patient symptoms and quality-of-life outcomes. Automated alerts are sent to treating hematologists based on the following predetermined criteria: presence of clinically important problems and symptoms, problems with adherence to therapy, and risk of COVID-19 diagnosis. The platform also allows physicians to set up video consultations. Clinical information regarding disease and treatment as well as clinical and survival outcomes are also prospectively collected. RESULTS: Recruitment of participants started in December 2020. As of April 2021, a total of 116 patients have been enrolled in this study. Use of this platform may help to improve patient-physician communication and help hematologists in the early recognition of clinically important problems and symptoms of their patients. More than 20 community and university-based hospitals have currently agreed to participate. In addition to patient-reported outcome data, the prospective collection of disease- and treatment-related information, as well as data on possible COVID-19 diagnosis and COVID-19 vaccination, will allow the development of a large database to also identify subgroups of patients at risk of poor outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Data generated via this platform will help to answer clinically relevant questions for patients with hematologic malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic and postpandemic era. The use of the GIMEMA-ALLIANCE platform in routine practice may also contribute to enhancing patient-centered care.

Increased levels of ferritin due to cytokine storm and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis were found in severe COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the role of ferritin in COVID-19. METHODS: Studies investigating ferritin in COVID-19 were collected from PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI, SinoMed, and WANFANG. A meta-analysis was performed to compare the ferritin level between different patient groups: non-survivors versus survivors; more severe versus less severe; with comorbidity versus without comorbidity; ICU versus non-ICU; with mechanical ventilation versus without mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: A total of 52 records involving 10 614 COVID-19-confirmed patients between December 25, 2019, and June 1, 2020, were included in this meta-analysis, and 18 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. The ferritin level was significantly increased in severe patients compared with the level in non-severe patients [WMD 397.77 (95% CI 306.51-489.02), P < .001]. Non-survivors had a significantly higher ferritin level compared with the one in survivors [WMD 677.17 (95% CI 391.01-963.33), P < .001]. Patients with one or more comorbidities including diabetes, thrombotic complication, and cancer had significantly higher levels of ferritin than those without (P < .01). Severe acute liver injury was significantly associated with high levels of ferritin, and its level was associated with intensive supportive care, including ICU transfer and mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Ferritin was associated with poor prognosis and could predict the worsening of COVID-19 patients.","Cheng, Linlin; Li, Haolong; Li, Liubing; Liu, Chenxi; Yan, Songxin; Chen, Haizhen; Li, Yongzhe",J Clin Lab Anal,,209

Here, we show Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 (IRF1), 3, and 7 levels are elevated in most bat tissues and that, basally, IRFs contribute to the expression of type I IFN ligands and high expression of interferon regulated genes (IRGs). CRISPR knockout (KO) of IRF 1/3/7 in cells reveals distinct subsets of genes affected by each IRF in an IFN-ligand signaling-dependent and largely independent manner. As the master regulators of innate immunity, the IRFs control the kinetics and maintenance of the IRG response and play essential roles in response to influenza A virus (IAV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), Melaka virus/Pteropine orthoreovirus 3 Melaka (PRV3M), and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. With its differential expression in bats compared to that in humans, this highlights a critical role for basal IRF expression in viral responses and potentially immune cell development in bats with relevance for IRF function in human biology.","Irving, Aaron T; Zhang, Qian; Kong, Pui-San; Luko, Katarina; Rozario, Pritisha; Wen, Ming; Zhu, Feng; Zhou, Peng; Ng, Justin H J; Sobota, Radoslaw M; Wang, Lin-Fa",Cell Rep,,209

For finitely presented groups, the ultrametric nature implies equivalence of the pointwise and uniform stability problems, and the profinite one implies that the corresponding approximation property is equivalent to residual finiteness. Moreover, a group is uniformly stable if and only if its largest residually finite quotient is. We provide several examples of uniformly stable groups: these include finite groups, virtually free groups, some groups acting on rooted trees, and certain lamplighter and (Generalized) Baumslag--Solitar groups.","Fournier-Facio, Francesco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00516v1.pdf,209
340527,The Use of Bronchoscopy During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: CHEST/AABIP Guideline and Expert Panel Report,2020,"BACKGROUND: Despite male youth taking more sexual risks that lead to unwanted partner pregnancy and/or sexually transmitted infections (STIs), research evaluating interventions for risky sex has focused almost exclusively on adolescent and adult females. With STIs among male youth on the rise, behavioral interventions that target risky sex among male youth are needed. PURPOSE: A randomized controlled pilot study was conducted to examine the feasibility and acceptability of two manualized behavioral interventions for sexually active male youth. METHODS: Sexually active at-risk male youth (N = 27) were recruited and randomized to receive one session of motivational interviewing (MI) or didactic educational counseling (DEC). Assessment interviews were conducted prior to and 3 months following the intervention session. RESULTS: Support for the feasibility and acceptability of delivering behavioral interventions to reduce risky sexual behaviors among at-risk male youth was found. Compared to participants in DEC at follow-up, participants in MI reported having significantly fewer sexual encounters with casual partners, used substances at the time of sex significantly less often with all partners and casual partners, and reported fewer incidents of using substances at the time of sex without a condom with all partners. Conversely, participants who received MI used substances at the time of sex with main partners and used substances at the time of sex without a condom more often with main partners at follow-up compared to participants who received DEC. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the pilot study support conducting a larger randomized controlled trial to examine treatment effects.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 at a referral centre in Madrid, Spain, during March-May 2020 was performed. Recorded variables (age, gender, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, outcome), and geographical area of origin were compared for Europeans and non-Europeans (Latin Americans, Asians and Africans). RESULTS: In total, 2345 patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized during the study period were included in the study. Of these, 1956 (83.4%) were European and 389 (16.6%) were non-European (of whom over 90%, 354/389, were Latin American). Non-Europeans were significantly younger than Europeans (mean 54 (SD 13.5) versus 70.4 (SD 15.1) years, p < 0.001); the majority were male (1420/2345, 60.6%), with no significant differences in gender between Europeans and non-Europeans (1197/1956 (61.2%) male in the European group versus 223/389 (57.3%) male in the non-European group, p 0.15). In-hospital mortality overall was higher in Europeans (443/1956, 22.7%) than in non-Europeans (40/389, 10.3%) (p < 0.001), but there were no significant differences when adjusted for age/gender (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.86-1.88). Non-Europeans were more frequently admitted to ICU (71/389, 18.3%) compared with Europeans (187/1956, 9.6%) (p < 0.001) and a difference in ICU admission rate was also found when adjusted for age/gender (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.03-1.98). CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences in mortality were observed between Europeans and non-Europeans (mainly Latin Americans), but an increase in ICU admission rate was found in non-Europeans.","Norman, Francesca F; Crespillo-Andújar, Clara; Pérez-Molina, José Antonio; Comeche, Belén; Chamorro, Sandra; Monge-Maillo, Begoña; Moreno-Guillén, Santiago; López-Vélez, Rogelio",Clin. microbiol. infect,,209

As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these questions, we analyze contact survey data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact-tracing information from Hunan province. Daily contacts were reduced seven- to eightfold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. We find that children 0 to 14 years of age are less susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection than adults 15 to 64 years of age (odds ratio 0.34, 95% confidence interval 0.24 to 0.49), whereas individuals more than 65 years of age are more susceptible to infection (odds ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.92). Based on these data, we built a transmission model to study the impact of social distancing and school closure on transmission. We find that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. Although proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they can reduce peak incidence by 40 to 60% and delay the epidemic.","Zhang, Juanjuan; Litvinova, Maria; Liang, Yuxia; Wang, Yan; Wang, Wei; Zhao, Shanlu; Wu, Qianhui; Merler, Stefano; Viboud, Cécile; Vespignani, Alessandro; Ajelli, Marco; Yu, Hongjie",Science,,209

The study covered 50 participants from various countries from the author's network. We considered a systematic flow diagram from March 25 to March 31, 2020 including demographic information of participants. Results: Al-most 74% of the participants clearly describe and explain all the ques-tions and still, 26% of the participants are not clear about their idea regarding COVID-19 disease. Moreover, the perceptions provided by the participants are also close to the guidelines of WHO and National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China regarding COVID-19. Only few participants’ understandings are not fully com-pleted compared to their guidelines. The current mental status was also analyzed in this study wherein 51% participants stated that they are suffering from mental stress and depression due to this virus. Conclusion: It is necessary to identify and improve the actual knowledge, aware-ness, and perception to control the spread of COVID-19. More awareness activities from responsible authority are required. Moreover, this survey will facilitate healthcare organizations and responsible authority to design their awareness activities in this critical moment. Additionally, general people will get benefited and prepared themselves to read the perceptions of the individual participator.","Rabby, Md Insiat Islam; Hossain, Farzad; Akhi, Israt Jahan; Amin, S.A.M.

350188,CT radiomics can help screen the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a preliminary study,2020,"The aim of this study is to provide a general overview of the economic impacts associated with vertebrate invasive species (VIS) in the United States and suggests a methodology for differentiating types of damage. We identify a general framework for categorizing VIS damage that separates this damage into three main categories: destruction, depredation, and disease. We then examine how this framework fits into current published estimates of damage and management costs. Economic impacts associated with feral swine damage and management are plentiful enough to warrant separate treatment from other VIS and are observed in all three categories. For all VIS examined in this study, damage estimates associated with destruction provide the most evaluations of VIS impacts, especially destruction of crops. Evaluations of the losses associated with depredation are largely absent from the literature. We find that while published studies have estimated substantial economic impact associated with VIS, the current state of the literature focusing on VIS frequently fails to address all of the categories of damage, is difficult to compare or replicate, and is unsuited for extrapolation to nation-wide estimates of damage.","Shwiff, Stephanie; Pelham, Alex; Shwiff, Steven; Haden-Chomphosy, William; Brown, Vienna R; Ernst, Karina; Anderson, Aaron",Biol Invasions,,209

351661,First Pediatric Case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Korea,2020,"ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) has a multiplicity of physiological roles that revolve around its trivalent function: a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, facilitator of amino acid transport, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 receptor. ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue. ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease. Although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 differs in several key amino acid residues, allowing for stronger binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor, which may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing. The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes mellitus. The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications. Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1-7 analogs, and Mas receptor agonists enhance ACE2 action and serve as potential therapies for disease conditions associated with an activated renin-angiotensin system. rhACE2 (recombinant human ACE2) has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively. Our review summarizes the progress over the past 20 years, highlighting the critical role of ACE2 as the novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor and as the negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, together with implications for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and associated cardiovascular diseases.","Gheblawi, Mahmoud; Wang, Kaiming; Viveiros, Anissa; Nguyen, Quynh; Zhong, Jiu-Chang; Turner, Anthony J; Raizada, Mohan K; Grant, Maria B; Oudit, Gavin Y",Circ Res,,209

352557,Major cardiovascular events in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019: Experience of a cardiovascular department of Northern Italy,2021,"We study option prices in financial markets where the risky asset prices are modelled by jump diffusions. For simplicity we put the risk free asset price equal to 1. Such markets are typically incomplete, and therefore there are in general infinitely many arbitrage-free option prices in these markets. We consider in particular European options with a terminal payoff F at the terminal time T, and propose that the right price of such an option is the initial wealth needed to make it possible to generate by a self-financing portfolio a terminal wealth which is as close as possible to the payoff F in the sense of variance. We show that such an optimal initial wealth \hat{z} with corresponding optimal portfolio \hat{\pi} exist and are unique. We call \hat{z} the minimal variance price of F and denote it by p_{mv}(F). In the classical Black-Scholes market this price coincides with the classical Black-Scholes option price. If the coefficients of the risky asset prices are deterministic, we show that p_{mv}(F)=E_{Q^{*}}[F], for a specific equivalent martingale measure (EMM) Q^{*}. This shows in particular that the minimal variance price is free from arbitrage. The, for the general case we apply a suitable maximum principle of optimal stochastic control to relate the minimal variance price \hat{z}=p_{mv}(F) to the Hamiltonian and its adjoint processes, and we show that, under some conditions, \hat{z}=p_{mv}(F)=E_{Q_0}[F] for any Q_0 in a family \mathbb{M}_0 of EMMs, described by the set of solutions of a system of linear equations. Finally, We illustrate our results by looking at specific examples.","Agram, Nacira; Oksendal, Bernt",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09577v1.pdf,209
352782,Acute Heart Failure in Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the Management of Comedications,2020,"In this paper it is demonstrated that the application of principal components analysis for regional cluster modelling and analysis is essential in the situations where there is significant multicollinearity among several parameters, especially when the dimensionality of regional data is measured in tens. The proposed principal components model allows for same-quality representation of the clustering of regions. In fact, the clusters become more distinctive and the apparent outliers become either more pronounced with the component model clustering or are alleviated with the respective hierarchical cluster. Thus, a five-component model was obtained and validated upon 85 regions of Russian Federation and 19 socio-economic parameters. The principal components allowed to describe approximately 75 percent of the initial parameters variation and enable further simulations upon the studied variables. The cluster analysis upon the principal components modelling enabled better exposure of regional structure and disparity in economic development in Russian Federation, consisting of four main clusters: the few-numbered highest development regions, the clusters with mid-to-high and low economic development, and the""poorest""regions. It is observable that the development in most regions relies upon resource economy, and the industrial potential as well as inter-regional infrastructural potential are not realized to their fullest, while only the wealthiest regions show highly developed economy, while the industry in other regions shows signs of stagnation which is scaled further due to the conditions entailed by economic sanctions and the recent Covid-19 pandemic. Most Russian regions are in need of additional public support and industrial development, as their capital assets potential is hampered and, while having sufficient labor resources, their donorship will increase.","Bezrukov, Alexander V.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10625v1.pdf,209

However, a majority of candidate blood biomarkers for neurological damage that are studied today are proteins which were arbitrarily proposed several decades before the advent of high-throughput omic techniques, and it is unclear whether they represent the best possible targets relative to the remainder of the human proteome. Here, we leveraged mRNA expression data generated from nearly 12,000 human specimens to algorithmically evaluate over 17,000 protein-coding genes in terms of their potential to produce blood biomarkers for neurological damage based on their expression profiles both across the body and within the brain. The circulating levels of proteins associated with the top-ranked genes were then measured in blood sampled from a diverse cohort of patients diagnosed with a variety of acute and chronic neurological disorders, including ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis, and evaluated for their diagnostic performance. Our analysis identifies several previously unexplored candidate blood biomarkers of neurological damage with possible clinical utility, many of which whose presence in blood is likely linked to specific cell-level pathologic processes. Furthermore, our findings also suggest that many frequently cited previously proposed blood biomarkers exhibit expression profiles which could limit their diagnostic efficacy.","O039,; Connell, Grant C; Alder, Megan L; Smothers, Christine G; Chang, Julia H C",Proc.

353800,394. Pseudo-outbreak of Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus Species from Blood Cultures Highlights Unique Challenges in Care of Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may provide additional and complementary findings for the management of these patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). This study addresses the cytological features of the infection and highlights the more influential inflammatory components. The correlation between pathological variables and clinical data is also analyzed. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of the cytopathological features of BAL in 20 COVID-19 patients and 20 members of a matched cohort from a critical ICU who had acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by other pulmonary conditions. RESULTS: A comparison of the controls (n = 20) and the COVID-19 patients (n = 20) revealed that the latter had a higher neutrophil count (median, 63.8% of the cell count) with lower percentages of macrophages and lymphocytes. An increase in the expression of CD68-positive, monocytic multinucleated giant cells (MGCs) was reported; megakaryocytes were not detected on CD61 staining. Perls staining showed isolated elements. In situ RNA analysis demonstrated scattered chromogenic signals in type II pneumocytes. An ultrastructural analysis confirmed the presence of intracytoplasmic vacuoles containing rounded structures measuring 140 nm in diameter (putative viral particles). In COVID-19 patients, the clinicopathological correlation revealed a positive correlation between lactate dehydrogenase values and MGCs (r = 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of BAL samples might be implemented as a routine practice for the evaluation of COVID-19 patients in ICUs in the appropriate clinical scenario. Additional studies using a larger sample size of patients who developed COVID-19 during the second wave of the epidemic in the autumn of 2020 are needed to further support our findings.","Canini, Valentina; Bono, Francesca; Calzavacca, Paolo; Capitoli, Giulia; Foti, Giuseppe; Fraggetta, Filippo; Galimberti, Stefania; Gianatti, Andrea; Giani, Marco; Nasr, Ahmed; Paciocco, Giuseppe; Pagni, Fabio; Rona, Roberto; L039,; Imperio, Vincenzo",Cancer cytophathol,,209

This study aims to estimate the prevalence of face mask usage and investigate about different types of face mask and their distribution among pedestrians in southwest Iran during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in August 2020 in Ahvaz, southwest Iran. Using a multistage sampling method, a total of 10,440 pedestrians selected from 8 urban districts and 92 neighborhoods of the city. The data gathered by observation method. Percentage, mean and standard deviation were used to describe the variables. Chi-square test, fisher exact test and Chi-square for trend used to assess relationship between two categorical variables. We used unconditional logistic regression model to control confounders. RESULTS: The most common age group was 10 to 39 years and 67.9% of the participants were male. The overall prevalence of face mask usage was 45.6% (95% CI, 44.6-46.5). In general, as the age increased, the prevalence of face mask use significantly increased (p for trend < 0.001). Women used face masks significantly higher than men (60.2% vs. 38.7%, p < 0.001). Among the pedestrians who used the mask, 75.6% wore facemask correctly. The most common type of facemask used by the pedestrians were surgical (medical) masks (63.8%). In total, the prevalence of facemask usage was significantly higher during a.m. (49.4%) compared to p.m. (43.9%), (p < 0.001). Besides, in our study, 1.7 and 0.3% of Pedestrians had worn gloves and shielded respectively. Women used shields and gloves significantly higher than men (3.6% vs. 0.7%, p < 0.001). Also, women used shields more than men (0.5% vs. 0.3%, p = 0.036). CONCLUSION: We concluded that the prevalence rate of face mask use in Ahvaz was fairly low especially in men and younger people. Hence, the observed rates probably cannot protect the community against COVID-19 spread. Therefore, it is important to implement educational programs as well as to establish laws and regulations governing the use of face masks in public places.","Rahimi, Zahra; Shirali, Gholam Abbas; Araban, Marzieh; Mohammadi, Mohammad Javad; Cheraghian, Bahman",BMC Public Health,,209

An important fact is that zinc is present in proteins of humans and of viruses. Some zinc sites in viral enzymes may serve as drug targets and may liberate zinc ions, thus leading to changes in intracellular concentration of zinc ions, while increased intracellular zinc may induce biological effects in both the host and the virus. Drugs such as chloroquine may contribute to increased intracellular zinc. Moreover, clinical trials on the use of zinc alone or in addition to other drugs in the prophylaxis/treatment of COVID-19 are ongoing. Thereby, we aim to discuss the rationale for targeting zinc metalloenzymes as a new strategy for the treatment of COVID-19.","Doboszewska, Urszula; Wlaz, Piotr; Nowak, Gabriel; Mlyniec, Katarzyna",Br. j. pharmacol,,209

Effective antivirals are still lacking. Here, we optimized a high-content imaging platform and the plaque assay for viral output study using the legitimate model of human lung epithelial cells, Calu-3, to determine the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of Andrographis paniculata extract and its major component, andrographolide. SARS-CoV-2 at 25TCID50 was able to reach the maximal infectivity of 95% in Calu-3 cells. Postinfection treatment of A. paniculata and andrographolide in SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 cells significantly inhibited the production of infectious virions with an IC50 of 0.036 µg/mL and 0.034 µM, respectively, as determined by the plaque assay. The cytotoxicity profile developed over the cell line representatives of major organs, including liver (HepG2 and imHC), kidney (HK-2), intestine (Caco-2), lung (Calu-3), and brain (SH-SY5Y), showed a CC50 of >100 µg/mL for A. paniculata extract and 13.2-81.5 µM for andrographolide, respectively, corresponding to a selectivity index of over 380. In conclusion, this study provided experimental evidence in favor of A. paniculata and andrographolide for further development as a monotherapy or in combination with other effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Sa-Ngiamsuntorn, Khanit; Suksatu, Ampa; Pewkliang, Yongyut; Thongsri, Piyanoot; Kanjanasirirat, Phongthon; Manopwisedjaroen, Suwimon; Charoensutthivarakul, Sitthivut; Wongtrakoongate, Patompon; Pitiporn, Supaporn; Chaopreecha, Jarinya; Kongsomros, Supasek; Jearawuttanakul, Kedchin; Wannalo, Warawuth; Khemawoot, Phisit; Chutipongtanate, Somchai; Borwornpinyo, Suparerk; Thitithanyanont, Arunee; Hongeng, Suradej",J Nat Prod,,209

Methods: We performed a single-center review of all adult kidney transplants performed during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. Patients were managed with standard immunosuppression protocols, including lymphocyte depleting induction and trough-guided tacrolimus. Retrospective data were collected for 3 months from the date of transplantation or until study conclusion (5/7/2020). The primary outcomes assessed included patient and allograft survival as well as COVID-19 related hospital readmission. Results: 30 kidney transplants were performed during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. After a median follow-up of 51.5 days, 93.3% of patients were alive with 100% death-censored allograft survival. 9 patients were readmitted to the hospital during the study period, 4 (13.3%) related to infection with COVID-19. Infections were mild in 3/4 patients, with one patient developing severe disease leading to respiratory failure. Patients readmitted with COVID-19 were numerically more likely to be African American, have a BMI &gt; 30 kg/m 2, have a lymphocyte count ≤ 300 cells/mL, and be on maintenance corticosteroids.

The identified binding sites may be helpful in the development of treatments for new viral outbreaks in the world when there is no information available about their pockets with COVID-19 being a case in point. Identification of the pockets using computational methods, as an alternative method, has recently attracted much interest. In this study, the binding site prediction is viewed as a semantic segmentation problem. An improved 3D version of the U-Net model based on the dice loss function is utilized to predict the binding sites accurately. The performance of the proposed model on the independent test datasets and SARS-COV-2 shows the segmentation model could predict the binding sites with a more accurate shape than the recently published deep learning model, i.e. DeepSite. Therefore, the model may help predict the binding sites of proteins and could be used in drug design for novel proteins.","Nazem, Fatemeh; Ghasemi, Fahimeh; Fassihi, Afshin; Dehnavi, Alireza Mehri",J Bioinform Comput Biol,,209

The aim of this trial was to assess if the addition of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir improved clinical outcomes in patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. METHODS: This was an open-label, multicentre, randomized controlled clinical trial in adults with moderate or severe COVID-19 admitted to four university hospitals in Iran. Patients were randomized into a treatment arm receiving sofosbuvir and daclatasvir plus standard care, or a control arm receiving standard care alone. The primary endpoint was clinical recovery within 14 days of treatment. The study is registered with IRCT.ir under registration number IRCT20200128046294N2. RESULTS: Between 26 March and 26 April 2020, 66 patients were recruited and allocated to either the treatment arm (n = 33) or the control arm (n = 33). Clinical recovery within 14 days was achieved by 29/33 (88%) in the treatment arm and 22/33 (67%) in the control arm (P = 0.076). The treatment arm had a significantly shorter median duration of hospitalization [6 days (IQR 4-8)] than the control group [8 days (IQR 5-13)]; P = 0.029. Cumulative incidence of hospital discharge was significantly higher in the treatment arm versus the control (Gray's P = 0.041). Three patients died in the treatment arm and five in the control arm. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir to standard care significantly reduced the duration of hospital stay compared with standard care alone. Although fewer deaths were observed in the treatment arm, this was not statistically significant. Conducting larger scale trials seems prudent.","Sadeghi, Anahita; Ali Asgari, Ali; Norouzi, Alireza; Kheiri, Zahedin; Anushirvani, Amir; Montazeri, Mahnaz; Hosamirudsai, Hadiseh; Afhami, Shirin; Akbarpour, Elham; Aliannejad, Rasoul; Radmard, Amir Reza; Davarpanah, Amir H; Levi, Jacob; Wentzel, Hannah; Qavi, Ambar; Garratt, Anna; Simmons, Bryony; Hill, Andrew; Merat, Shahin",J Antimicrob Chemother,,209

371042,Anemia is associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic is causing projected annual CO 2emission reductions up to-8% for 2020. This approximately matches the reductions required year on year to fulfill the Paris agreement. We pursue the question whether related atmospheric concentration changes may be detected by the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON), and brought into agreement with bottom-up emission-reduction estimates. We present a mathematical framework to derive annual growth rates from observed column-averaged carbon dioxide (XCO 2) including uncertainties. The min-max range of TCCON growth rates for 2012-2019 was [2.00, 3.27] ppm/yr with a largest one-year increase of 1.07 ppm/yr for 2015/16 caused by El Niño. Uncertainties are 0.38 [0.28, 0.44] ppm/yr limited by synoptic variability, including a 0.05 ppm/yr contribution from single-measurement precision. TCCON growth rates are linked to a UK Met Office forecast of a COVID-19-related reduction of -0.32 ppm yr -2in 2020 for Mauna Loa. The separation of TCCON-measured growth rates vs. the reference forecast (without COVID-19) is discussed in terms of detection delay. A 0.6 [0.4, 0.7]-yr delay is caused by the impact of synoptic variability on XCO 2, including a ≈1-month contribution from single-measurement precision. A hindrance for the detection of the COVID-19-related growth rate reduction in 2020 is the ±0.57 ppm/yr uncertainty for the forecasted reference case (without COVID-19). Only assuming the ongoing growth rate reductions increasing year-on-year by -0.32 ppm yr -2would allow a discrimination of TCCON measurements vs. the unperturbed forecast and its uncertainty-with a 2.4 [2.2, 2.5]-yr delay. Using no forecast but the max-min range of the TCCON-observed growth rates for discrimination only leads to a factor ≈2 longer delay. Therefore, the forecast uncertainties for annual growth rates must be reduced. This requires improved terrestrial ecosystem models and ocean observations to better quantify the land and ocean sinks dominating interannual variability.","Sussmann, Ralf; Rettinger, Markus",Remote Sens.,,209

Regarding the important role of nutrition on the immunity, the present review article aimed to outline nutritional support of DM during the outbreak of COVID-19 with a mechanistic insight. Methods: Searches were performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases from 2000 until December 2020 using the following keywords. All relevant clinical and experimental studies published in English were included. Results: Evidences revealed that hyperglycemia is a significant predictor of some viral infections including COVID-19 which can exacerbate the complications of DM. According to the literature review, adequate intake of dietary protein, fiber, essential fatty acids and some micronutrients especially vitamins D, C, B12, folate, zinc and selenium has beneficial effects on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in diabetic patients through modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses or direct effects on virus enzymes or the rate of cell entrance. Conclusions: It is well understood that malnutrition may increase susceptibility to viral infections and disease progression. Therefore, considering nutritional status of diabetic patients and reasonable supplementation of the above mentioned nutrients can ameliorate the symptoms of COVID-19 in DM. However, further well-designed clinical trials are needed to determine their therapeutic dose.","Mahluji, Sepideh; Jalili, Mahsa; Ostadrahimi, Alireza; Hallajzadeh, Jamal; Ebrahimzadeh-Attari, Vahideh; Saghafi-Asl, Maryam",J Diabetes Metab Disord,,209
372617,Pos-005 Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Covid-19 Patients Admitted at a Private Hospital,2021,"RATIONALE: SARS-CoV-2 gains entrance to airway epithelial cells (AECs) through binding of the viral spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface. However, ACE-2 also converts angiotensin II into angiotensin-(1-7) and counterbalances the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, with resultant protective effects in the cardiovascular system. Some data suggest that two common antihypertension medications (angiotensin II receptor blockers, ARBs;and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, AECi) may increase ACE-2 expression in heart and kidney cells, fueling debate about how these widely used medications may modulate SARS-CoV2 infectivity and risk of COVID-19. Aim: Determine whether exposure of bronchial AECs to the ARB losartan or the ACEi captopril modulate expression of ACE-2 by AECs and/or SARS CoV2 replication. Methods: Primary bronchial AECs from children and adults (n=18;ages 8-75 yrs.) were differentiated ex vivo at an air-liquid interface to generate organotypic cultures. Cultures were treated with captopril (1μM) or losartan (2μM) added to basolateral media with each culture media change starting 72 hrs. before infection with SARS-CoV-2. In a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility, cultures were infected with SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. At 96 hrs. following infection, RNA and protein were isolated from cultures. SARS-CoV-2 replication in cultures was assessed with quantitative PCR, and quantified as viral copy number/ng RNA. ACE-2 expression was assessed by qPCR. Results: Neither captopril nor losartan treatment significantly changed AEC-2 expression by AECs as compared to untreated AEC cultures or SARS-CoV-2 infected AEC cultures without captopril or losartan treatment. At 96 hrs. following infection, SARS-CoV-2 copy number/ng RNA was not significantly different between untreated AEC cultures (median 1752, 95% CI 213 - 8599), cultures treated with captopril (median 448.6, 95% CI 160 - 3051), or cultures treated with lorsartan (median 640, 95% CI 127 - 1610;Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA p=0.4). Conclusion: These findings suggest that at the level of the airway epithelium neither the ACEi captopril or ARB losartan significantly modify expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry factor ACE-2, nor does either medication effect the replication of SARS-CoV-2. This ex vivo data is reassuring and is consistent with evolving clinical data suggesting ACEi and ARB medications do not increase the risk for poor prognosis with COVID-19, and may actually reduce the risk of COVID-19 disease.","Rich, L.

374640,The Impact of The Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak on The Quality of Life of Patients with Epilepsy,2021,"BACKGROUND: Previous reports suggest that the attributes of frailty are multidimensional and include nutrition, cognition, mentality, and other aspects. We aim to develop an early warning model of frailty based on nutritional risk screening and apply the frailty early warning model in the clinic to screen high-risk patients and provide corresponding intervention target information. METHODS: The proposed study includes two stages. In the first stage, we aim to develop a prediction model of frailty among older inpatients with nutritional risk. Study data were collected from a population-based aging cohort study in China. A prospective cohort study design will be used in the second stage of the study. We will recruit 266 older inpatients (age 65 years or older) with nutritional risk, and we will apply the frailty model in the clinic to explore the predictive ability of the model in participants, assess patients' health outcomes with implementation of the frailty model, and compare the model with existing frailty assessment tools. Patients' health outcomes will be measured at admission and at 30-day follow-up. DISCUSSION: This project is the first to develop an early prediction model of frailty for older inpatients according to nutritional risk in a nationally representative sample of Chinese older inpatients of tertiary hospitals. The results will hopefully help to promote the development of more detailed frailty assessment tools according to nutritional risk, which may ultimately lead to reduced health care costs and improvement in independence and quality of life among geriatric patients.

375300,The effectiveness of quarantine of Wuhan city against the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A well-mixed SEIR model analysis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide. Despite various attempts to improve the diagnosis and therapy of ovarian cancer patients, the survival rate for these patients is still dismal, mainly because most of them are diagnosed at a late stage. Up to 90% of ovarian cancers arise from neoplastic transformation of ovarian surface epithelial cells, and are usually referred to as epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Unlike most human cancers, which are disseminated through blood-borne metastatic routes, EOC has traditionally been thought to be disseminated through direct migration of ovarian tumor cells to the peritoneal cavity and omentum via peritoneal fluid. It has recently been shown, however, that EOC can also be disseminated through blood-borne metastatic routes, challenging previous thoughts about ovarian cancer metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we review our current understanding of the most updated cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying EOC metastasis and discuss in more detail two main metastatic routes of EOC, i.e., transcoelomic metastasis and hematogenous metastasis. The emerging concept of blood-borne EOC metastasis has led to exploration of the significance of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as novel and non-invasive prognostic markers in this daunting cancer. We also evaluate the role of tumor stroma, including cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), endothelial cells, adipocytes, dendritic cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) components in EOC growth and metastasis. Lastly, we discuss therapeutic approaches for targeting EOC. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying EOC metastasis will open up avenues to the design of new therapeutic options. For instance, understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the hematogenous metastasis of EOC, the biology of CTCs, and the detailed mechanisms through which EOC cells take advantage of stromal cells may help to find new opportunities for targeting EOC metastasis.","Yousefi, Meysam; Dehghani, Sadegh; Nosrati, Rahim; Ghanei, Mahmoud; Salmaninejad, Arash; Rajaie, Sara; Hasanzadeh, Malihe; Pasdar, Alireza",Cellular oncology (2011.

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using linear mixed models with random intercept and fixed slopes to assess the association of population density and R0, and controlled for state-level effects using random intercepts. We also assessed whether the association was differential across county-level main mode of transportation percentage as a proxy for transportation accessibility, and adjusted for median household income. The median R0 among the United States counties was 1.66 (IQR: 1.35-2.11). A population density threshold of 22 people/km2 was needed to sustain an outbreak. Counties with greater population density have greater rates of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, likely due to increased contact rates in areas with greater density. An increase in one unit of log population density increased R0 by 0.16 (95% CI: 0.13 to 0.19). This association remained when adjusted for main mode of transportation and household income. The effect of population density on R0 was not modified by transportation mode. Our findings suggest that dense areas increase contact rates necessary for disease transmission. SARS-CoV-2 R0 estimates need to consider this geographic variability for proper planning and resource allocation, particularly as epidemics newly emerge and old outbreaks resurge.","Sy, Karla Therese L; White, Laura F; Nichols, Brooke E",PLoS One,,209
375895,Detecting COVID-19-related Chronic Pulmonary Injury with 129Xe MRI,2021,"BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that patients with moderate-to-severe asthma belong to a high-risk group that is susceptible to severe COVID-19. However, the association between asthma and COVID-19 has not been well-established. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to determine the prevalence of asthma among COVID-19 patients in a major U.S. health system. We assessed the clinical characteristics and comorbidities in asthmatic and non-asthmatic COVID-19 patients. We also determined the risk of hospitalization associated with asthma and/or inhaled corticosteroid use. METHODS: Medical records of patients with COVID-19 were searched by a computer algorithm (March 1-April 15, 2020), and chart review was used to validate the diagnosis of asthma and medications prescribed for asthma. All patients were PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Demographics and clinical features were characterized. Regression models were used to assess the associations between asthma and corticosteroid use and the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 1,526 patients identified with COVID-19, 220 (14%) were classified as having asthma. Asthma was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (RR of 0.96 [95%CI: 0.77-1.19]) after adjusting for age, sex, gender, and comorbidities. The ongoing use of ICS did not increase the risk of hospitalization in a similar adjusted model (RR of 1.39 [95%CI: 0.90-2.15]). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a substantial prevalence of asthma in our COVID-19 cohort, asthma was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization. Similarly, the use of ICS with or without systemic corticosteroids was not associated with COVID-19-related hospitalization.","Chhiba, Krishan D; Patel, Gayatri B; Vu, Thanh Huyen T; Chen, Michael M; Guo, Amina; Kudlaty, Elizabeth; Mai, Quan; Yeh, Chen; Muhammad, Lutfiyya N; Harris, Kathleen E; Bochner, Bruce S; Grammer, Leslie C; Greenberger, Paul A; Kalhan, Ravi; Kuang, Fei Li; Saltoun, Carol A; Schleimer, Robert P; Stevens, Whitney W; Peters, Anju T",J. allergy clin. immunol,,209

Prevalence of HIV in Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19 and Associated Mortality Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,2020,"There is broad interest in improved methods to generate robust evidence regarding best practice, especially in settings where patient conditions are heterogenous and require multiple concomitant therapies. Here, we present the rationale and design of a large, international trial that combines features of adaptive platform trials with pragmatic point-of-care trials to determine best treatment strategies for patients admitted to an intensive care unit with severe community-acquired pneumonia. The trial uses a novel design, entitled ""a randomized embedded multifactorial adaptive platform."" The design has five key features: 1) randomization, allowing robust causal inference; 2) embedding of study procedures into routine care processes, facilitating enrollment, trial efficiency, and generalizability; 3) a multifactorial statistical model comparing multiple interventions across multiple patient subgroups; 4) response-adaptive randomization with preferential assignment to those interventions that appear most favorable; and 5) a platform structured to permit continuous, potentially perpetual enrollment beyond the evaluation of the initial treatments. The trial randomizes patients to multiple interventions within four treatment domains: antibiotics, antiviral therapy for influenza, host immunomodulation with extended macrolide therapy, and alternative corticosteroid regimens, representing 240 treatment regimens. The trial generates estimates of superiority, inferiority, and equivalence between regimens on the primary outcome of 90-day mortality, stratified by presence or absence of concomitant shock and proven or suspected influenza infection. The trial will also compare ventilatory and oxygenation strategies, and has capacity to address additional questions rapidly during pandemic respiratory infections. As of January 2020, REMAP-CAP (Randomized Embedded Multifactorial Adaptive Platform for Community-acquired Pneumonia) was approved and enrolling patients in 52 intensive care units in 13 countries on 3 continents. In February, it transitioned into pandemic mode with several design adaptations for coronavirus disease 2019. Lessons learned from the design and conduct of this trial should aid in dissemination of similar platform initiatives in other disease areas.Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02735707).","Angus, Derek C; Berry, Scott; Lewis, Roger J; Al-Beidh, Farah; Arabi, Yaseen; van Bentum-Puijk, Wilma; Bhimani, Zahra; Bonten, Marc; Broglio, Kristine; Brunkhorst, Frank; Cheng, Allen C; Chiche, Jean-Daniel; De Jong, Menno; Detry, Michelle; Goossens, Herman; Gordon, Anthony; Green, Cameron; Higgins, Alisa M; Hullegie, Sebastiaan J; Kruger, Peter; Lamontagne, Francois; Litton, Edward; Marshall, John; McGlothlin, Anna; McGuinness, Shay; Mouncey, Paul; Murthy, Srinivas; Nichol, Alistair; O039,; Neill, Genevieve K; Parke, Rachael; Parker, Jane; Rohde, Gernot; Rowan, Kathryn; Turner, Anne; Young, Paul; Derde, Lennie; McArthur, Colin; Webb, Steven A",Ann Am Thorac Soc,,209

Therefore, this systematic review was conducted to assess the impact and prevalence of sleep problems among those categories. METHODS: APA PsycINFO; Cochrane; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); EBSCOhost; EMBASE; Google Scholar; MEDLINE; ProQuest Medical; ScienceDirect; Scopus; and Web of Science from 01 November 2019 to 05 July 2020. Additionally, four preprints servers (medRxiv.org; Preprints.org; psyarxiv.com; arXiv.org; biorxiv.org) were also searched for papers accepted after peer-review but not yet published and indexed. There was no language restriction. The random-effect models meta-analysis model were used with the DerSimonian and Laird methodology. RESULTS: Forty-four papers, involving a total of 54,231 participants from 13 countries, were judged relevant and contributed to the systematic review and meta-analysis of sleep problems during COVID-19. The global pooled prevalence rate of sleep problems among all populations was 35.7% [95%CI 29.4-42.4%]. COVID-19 patients appeared to be the most affected group, with a pooled rate of 74.8% [95%CI 28.7-95.6%]. Healthcare workers and the general population had comparative rates of sleep problems with rates of 36.0% [95%CI 21.1-54.2%] and 32.3% [95%CI 25.3-40.2%], respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of sleep problems during the COVID-19 pandemic is high and approximately affect 40% of people from the general and healthcare populations.

Although the origin of the associated virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) remains unclear, genetic evidence suggests that bats are a reservoir host of the virus, and pangolins are a probable intermediate. SARS-CoV-2 has crossed the species barrier to infect humans and other animal species, and infected humans can facilitate reverse-zoonotic transmission to animals.

378869,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and QTc prolongation,2021,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia is globally concerning. We aimed to investigate the clinical and CT features in the pregnant women and children with this disease, which have not been well reported. METHODS: Clinical and CT data of 59 patients with COVID-19 from January 27 to February 14, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed, including 14 laboratory-confirmed non-pregnant adults, 16 laboratory-confirmed and 25 clinically-diagnosed pregnant women, and 4 laboratory-confirmed children. The clinical and CT features were analyzed and compared. FINDINGS: Compared with the non-pregnant adults group (nâ¯=â¯14), initial normal body temperature (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]), leukocytosis (8 [50%] and 9 [36%]) and elevated neutrophil ratio (14 [88%] and 20 [80%]), and lymphopenia (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]) were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (nâ¯=â¯16) and clinically-diagnosed (nâ¯=â¯25) pregnant groups. Totally 614 lesions were detected with predominantly peripheral and bilateral distributions in 54 (98%) and 37 (67%) patients, respectively. Pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) was the predominant presence in 94/131 (72%) lesions for the non-pregnant adults. Mixed consolidation and complete consolidation were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (70/161 [43%]) and clinically-diagnosed (153/322 [48%]) pregnant groups than 37/131 (28%) in the non-pregnant adults (Pâ¯=â¯0·007, Pâ¯<â¯0·001). GGO with reticulation was less common in 9/161 (6%) and 16/322 (5%) lesions for the two pregnant groups than 24/131 (18%) for the non-pregnant adults (Pâ¯=â¯0·001, Pâ¯<â¯0·001). The pulmonary involvement in children with COVID-19 was mild with a focal GGO or consolidation. Twenty-three patients underwent follow-up CT, revealing progression in 9/13 (69%) at 3 days whereas improvement in 8/10 (80%) at 6-9 days after initial CT scans. INTERPRETATION: Atypical clinical findings of pregnant women with COVID-19 could increase the difficulty in initial identification. Consolidation was more common in the pregnant groups. The clinically-diagnosed cases were vulnerable to more pulmonary involvement. CT was the modality of choice for early detection, severity assessment, and timely therapeutic effects evaluation for the cases with epidemic and clinical features of COVID-19 with or without laboratory confirmation. The exposure history and clinical symptoms were more helpful for screening in children versus chest CT.","Liu, Huanhuan; Liu, Fang; Li, Jinning; Zhang, Tingting; Wang, Dengbin; Lan, Weishun",J Infect,,209

Data on treatment are scare and parallels have been made between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral with efficient in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Evidence of clinical improvement in patients with severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir is controversial. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical outcomes and virological monitoring of the first five COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France, for severe pneumonia related to SARS-CoV-2 and treated with remdesivir. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in blood plasma and the lower and upper respiratory tract. Among the five patients treated, two needed mechanical ventilation and one needed high-flow cannula oxygen. A significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract was observed in most cases, but two patients died with active SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lower respiratory tract. Plasma samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in only one patient. Remdesivir was interrupted before the initialy planned duration in four patients, two because of alanine aminotransferase elevations (3 to 5 normal range) and two because of renal failure requiring renal replacement.

However, WBL modules have the potential to make them aware of how one informs and reinforces the other. Students identified teamwork, communication and reflection as necessary at the workplace and in their studies. They also viewed learning agility at critical, especially in the time of coronavirus disease 2019.Originality/valueThe paper adds to the existing literature exploring how WBL learning can help minimise the gap between the classroom and the workplace by adding the analysis of the case study. Those interested in developing modules which embed theory and practice can benefit from the discussion on how such modules enable students to reflect on the crossover between the two sites, not only on degree apprenticeships but higher education degrees broadly.","Iro, Konstantinou Miller Elizabeth",Journal of Work-Applied Management,,209

Our study aimed at assessing the frequency of vascular and extravascular events' distribution in a retrospective cohort of 42 COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Patients were evaluated by whole-body CT angiography between March 16 and April 30, 2020. Twenty-three out of the 42 patients evaluated were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Vascular and extravascular findings were categorized into ""relevant"" or ""other/incidental,"" first referring to the need for immediate patient care and management. Student T-test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Fisher exact test was used to compare study groups, where appropriate. RESULTS: Relevant vascular events were recorded in 71.4% of cases (n = 30). Pulmonary embolism was the most frequent in both ICU and non-ICU cases (56.5% vs. 10.5%, p = 0.002). Ischemic infarctions at several sites such as the gut, spleen, liver, brain, and kidney were detected (n = 20), with multi-site involvement in some cases. Systemic venous thrombosis occurred in 30.9% of cases compared to 7.1% of systemic arterial events, the first being significantly higher in ICU patients (p = 0.002). Among incidental findings, small-sized splanchnic arterial aneurysms were reported in 21.4% of the study population, with no significant differences in ICU and non-ICU patients. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular involvement is not negligible in COVID-19 and should be carefully investigated as it may significantly affect disease behavior and prognosis. KEY POINTS: â¢ Relevant vascular events were recorded in 71.4% of the study population, with pulmonary embolism being the most frequent event in ICU and non-ICU cases. â¢ Apart from the lung, other organs such as the gut, spleen, liver, brain, and kidneys were involved with episodes of ischemic infarction. Systemic venous and arterial thrombosis occurred in 30.9% and 7.1% of cases, respectively, with venous events being significantly higher in ICU patients (p = 0.002). â¢ Among incidental findings, small-sized splanchnic arterial aneurysms were reported in 21.4% of the whole population.","Rea, Gaetano; Lassandro, Francesco; Lieto, Roberta; Bocchini, Giorgio; Romano, Federica; Sica, Giacomo; Valente, Tullio; Muto, Emanuele; Murino, Patrizia; Pinto, Antonio; Montesarchio, Vincenzo; Muto, Maurizio; Pacella, Daniela; Capitelli, Ludovica; Bocchino, Marialuisa",Eur. radiol,,209

These rely on understanding the biology of the virus and its interaction with the host, and on agnostic phenotypic screening for compounds that prevent viral infection. In vitro screenings of compounds are usually performed in human or animal-derived tumor or immortalized cell lines due to their ease of culturing. However, these platforms may not represent the tissues affected by the disease in vivo, and therefore better models are needed to validate and expedite drug development, especially in face of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this scenario, human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are a powerful research tool due to their ability to generate normal differentiated cell types relevant for the disease. Here we discuss the different ways hiPSCs can contribute to COVID-19 related research, including modeling the disease in vitro and serving as a platform for drug screening.","Nolasco, Patricia; Borsoi, Juliana; Moraes, Carolina Borsoi; Freitas-Junior, Lucio H; Pereira, Lygia Veiga",Genet Mol Biol,,209

However, uncertainties of the underlying mechanisms of multiple organ involvement remain. A substantial proportion of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have lymphopenia, low serum iron levels, and multiple organ involvement. Several therapeutic agents have been used for different stages of the disease, but the treatment for severe disease is still suboptimal. Understanding the mechanism of programmed cell death in COVID-19 may lead to better therapeutic strategies for these patients. On the basis of observations of basic science studies and clinical researches on COVID-19, we hypothesize that ferroptosis, a novel programmed cell death, may be an important cause of multiple organ involvement in COVID-19 and it might serve as a new treatment target. In spite of the existing findings on the involvement of ferroptosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is no reported study to uncover how does ferroptosis acts in SARS-CoV-2 infection yet. Uncovering the role of ferroptosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to develop new treatment strategies for COVID-19. Intracellular cell iron depletion or new generation of ferroptosis inhibitors might be potential drug candidates for COVID-19. We hope this hypothesis may launch a new wave of studies to uncover the association of ferroptosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo.","Yang, Ming; Lai, Ching Lung",Cell Death Discov,,209

This project aims to assess and understand the complex interplay of eco-bio-social-political factors that determine infantile anaemia to inform policy, research design and prevention practices. METHODS: This is a longitudinal birth cohort study including four components: (1) biological, will assess known blood markers of iron homeostasis and anaemia and stool microbiota to identify and genetically analyse the participants' flora; (2) ecological, will assess and map pollutants in air, water and soil and evaluate features of nutrition and perceived food security; (3) social, which will use different qualitative research methodologies to explore key stakeholders and informants' perceptions related to nutritional, environmental and anaemia topics, participant observations and a participatory approach and (4) a political analysis, to identify and assess the impact of policies, guidelines and programmes at all levels for infantile anaemia in the three regions. Finally, we will also explore the role of social determinants and demographic variables longitudinally for all study participants.

However, it is currently unknown that its HFABP is also closely related to the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively screened 46 patients who met our inclusion criteria within 4 weeks. They were tested for HFABP after the diagnosis of COVID-19, and monitored for HFABP during their hospital stay. We tracked the patients during their hospital stay to determine if they had severe COVID-19 or mild-to-severe transition features. We calculated the chi-square test values found for HFABP to predict the correlation between HFABP levels and the severity of the COVID-19. RESULTS: Of these 46 cases, 16 cases with confirmed COVID-19 were tested for HFABP> 7 ng / mL upon admission; among them, 14 cases were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 within the hospitalization. The Odds ratio of the measured HFABP elevation was 6.81(95% confidence interval [CI] 5.23-8.40), and 3 patients with severe COVID-19 progressed in 5 patients with mild HFABP> 7 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the elevation of HFABP is closely related to the severity of COVID-19 in the patients, and the elevated HFABP may cause rapid development of patients with mild COVID-19 into severe COVID-19. But serum HFABP negative maybe make patients with mild COVID-19 safer, the current data show no effect on the all-cause mortality.

In response, pooled testing has emerged as a promising strategy that can immediately increase testing capacity. In pooled sample testing, multiple samples are combined (or pooled) together and tested as a single unit. If the pool is positive, the individual samples can then be individually tested to identify the positive case(s). Here, we provide support for the adoption of sample pooling with the point-of-care Cepheid Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay. Corroborating previous findings, the limit of detection of this assay was comparable to laboratory-developed reverse-transcription quantitative PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests, with observed detection below 100 copies/mL. The Xpert® Xpress assay detected SARS-CoV-2 after samples with minimum viral loads of 461 copies/mL were pooled in groups of six. Based on these data, we recommend the adoption of pooled testing with the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay where warranted based on public health needs. The suggested number of samples per pool, or the pooling depth, is unique for each point-of-care testing site and can be determined by the positive test rates. To statistically determine appropriate pooling depth, we have calculated the pooling efficiency for numerous combinations of pool sizes and test rates. This information is included as a supplemental dataset that we encourage public health authorities to use as a guide to make recommendations that will maximize testing capacity and resource conservation.","Becker, Michael G; Taylor, Tracy; Kiazyk, Sandra; Cabiles, Dana R; Meyers, Adrienne F A; Sandstrom, Paul A",PLoS One,,209

We used 3-year linked data from the COMPASS study, including 7653 Canadian (Quebec, Ontario) adolescents from which 1937 completed all 3 survey waves (pre-COVID-19 [2018, 2019] and online [2020] during the early pandemic period [May-July 2020]). Structural equation modeling (SEM) and double difference (DD) models were used to estimate pre-COVID-19 to initial COVID-19 pandemic period change (2019-2020) in cannabis use (monthly, weekly, daily) compared to 2018 to 2019 change to adjust for age-related effects. Models were adjusted for age of entry into the cohort and sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: In the SEM and DD models, monthly, weekly, and daily cannabis use increased across all waves; however, the expected increases from the pre-COVID-19 wave (2019) to the initial COVID-19 period wave (2020) were lesser relative to the changes seen across the 2018 to 2019 waves. The cross-sectional data from May to July 2020 identified that the majority of youth who use cannabis did not report increased cannabis use due to COVID-19 or using cannabis to cope with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic period, there does not appear to be a detrimental effect on youth cannabis use, when adjusted for age-related changes.

It is not clear till now what is the pathogenesis of this virus infection in human or the exact strategies of host immune response in combating this novel threat to human beings. However, morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 infections vary widely from asymptomatic, mild to deadly critical. Strangely, children were found to be protected from severe or deadly critical infections, while elderly and immunocompromised adults are most affected badly by this virus.

Several animal species can be naturally or experimentally infected by SARS-CoV-2, with compelling evidence that mink is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human-to-mink infection cases have been reported and there are also suggestions that mink-to-human infection occurs. Mink infections have been reported to date only on fur farms, except for one infected free- ranging wild mink near a Utah (USA) fur farm, which suggests a transmission pathway from farms to wild mink. We now report the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 2 of 13 feral dark brown American mink (Neovison vison) trapped in the Valencian Community (Eastern Spain), during an invasive species trapping campaign. They were trapped in riverbeds in sparsely inhabited rural areas known to harbor self-sustained feral mink populations. The closest fur farm is about 20 km away. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by two-step RT-PCR in these animals’ mesenteric lymph nodes and was confirmed by sequencing a 397-nucleotide amplified region of the S gene, yielding identical sequences in both animals. A molecular phylogenetic analysis was run on this sequence, which was found to correspond to the consensus SARS-CoV-2 sequence from Wuhan. Our findings appear to represent the first example of SARS-CoV-2 acquired in the wild by feral mink in self-sustained populations.","Aguiló-Gisbert, Jordi Padilla-Blanco Miguel Lizana Victor Maiques Elisa Muñoz-Baquero Marta Chillida-Martínez Eva Cardells Jesús Rubio-Guerri Consuelo",Animals,,209

Methods: Review of clinical examination, CT, PET, MRI imaging, and autoantibodies testing. Results: The patient presented subacute cerebellar syndrome and myoclonus several days after general infectious symptoms. The oropharyngeal swab test was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Brain MRI was normal. CSF testing showed normal cell counts, negative RT-qPCR and no oligoclonal banding. Brain 18F-FDG-PET showed diffuse cortical hypometabolism, associated with putaminal and cerebellum hypermetabolism, compatible with encephalitis, and especially cerebellitis. The immunological study revealed high titers of IgG autoantibodies in serum and CSF directed against the nuclei of Purkinje cells, striatal and hippocampal neurons. Search for neoplasia including whole-body 18F-FDG-PET and CT scans was negative. Treatment with steroids allowed a rapid improvement of symptoms. Conclusion: This clinical case brings arguments on the possible relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and autoimmune encephalitis, and on the interest of 18F-FDG-PET in such context.","Grimaldi, Stephan; Lagarde, Stanislas; Harle, Jean-Robert; Boucraut, Joseph; Guedj, Eric",J. nucl. med,,209

407464,Status of Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Animal Production,2020,"Older adults are the main victims of the novel COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak and elderly in Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) are severely hit in terms of mortality. This paper presents a quantitative study of the impact of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy during first stages of the epidemic, focusing on the effects on mortality increase among older adults over 80 and its correlation with LTCFs. The study of growth patterns shows a power-law scaling regime for the first stage of the pandemic with an uneven behaviour among different regions as well as for the overall mortality increase according to the different impact of COVID-19. However, COVID-19 incidence rate does not fully explain the differences of mortality impact in older adults among different regions. We define a quantitative correlation between mortality in older adults and the number of people in LTCFs confirming the tremendous impact of COVID-19 on LTCFs. In addition a correlation between LTCFs and undiagnosed cases as well as effects of health system dysfunction is also observed. Our results confirm that LTCFs did not play a protective role on older adults during the pandemic, but the higher the number of elderly people living in LTCFs the greater the increase of both general and COVID-19 related mortality. We also observed that the handling of the crises in LTCFs hampered an efficient tracing of COVID-19 spread and promoted the increase of deaths not directly attributed to SARS-CoV-2.","Amore, Stefano; Puppo, Emanuela; Melara, Josué; Terracciano, Elisa; Gentili, Susanna; Liotta, Giuseppe",Sci Rep,,209

Using actual institutional data, we investigated the change in imaging utilization and revenue during this public health crisis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Imaging performed within the 8-week span between March 8 and April 30, 2020 was categorized into the COVID-19 healthcare crisis timeframe. The first week of this date range and the 10 weeks prior were used to derive the normal practice expected volume. A rolling 7-day total value was used for volume tracking and comparison. Total imaging utilization was derived and organized by patient setting (outpatient, inpatient, emergency) and imaging modality (X-ray, CT, Mammography, MRI, Nuclear Medicine/PET, US). The three highest volume hospitals were analyzed. Revenue information was collected from the hospital billing system. RESULTS: System-wide imaging volume decreased by 55% between April 7 and 13, 2020. Outpatient exams decreased by 68% relative to normal practice. Emergency exams decreased by 48% and inpatient exams declined by 31%. Mammograms and nuclear medicine scans were the most affected modalities, decreasing by 93% and 61%, respectively. The main campus hospital experienced less relative imaging volume loss compared to the other smaller and outpatient-driven hospitals. At its lowest point, the technical component revenue from main campus imaging services demonstrated a 49% negative variance from normal practice. CONCLUSION: The trends and magnitude of the actual imaging utilization data presented will help inform evidence-based decisions for more accurate volume predictions, policy changes, and institutional preparedness for current and future pandemics.","Parikh, Keval D; Ramaiya, Nikhil H; Kikano, Elias G; Tirumani, Sree Harsha; Pandya, Himanshu; Stovicek, Bart; Sunshine, Jeffrey L; Plecha, Donna M",Acad Radiol,,209

Although the incidence is decreasing in developed countries, it is on increase in most of the African countries. Objective: This study aimed to identify different time trends of breast cancer incidence among African countries using latent mixture approach. Methods: The information includes newly diagnosed breast cancer patients per 100,000 women for 53 African countries in a period of 1990-2016. Latent mixture modeling was performed in Mplus 7.4 software. Results: The overall trend of breast cancer in Africa was increasing. Latent mixture model with 5 clusters was estimated as the best using fit indices and linear growth trajectories were specified for each cluster. Nigeria was the only country which belongs to a cluster with negative slope indicating a slow decrease in the breast cancer incidence; also, Seychelles was the only country that showed a sharp increase over time. 31 countries belonged to a cluster with a slope of 0.08, indicating that the incidence of breast cancer is almost constant over time. Cluster 3 including Algeria, Angola, Botswana, Central African Republic, Cote d'lvoire, Equatorial Guinea, Lesotho, Libya, Namibia, Somalia, Sudan, Swaziland, Uganda and Zimbabwe and cluster 2 including Gabon, Mauritius, Morocco, South Africa, Tunisia and Congo showed a slow and moderate increase in the incidence of breast cancer, respectively.

Goal 1 of this study was to identify rates of mental health problems experienced by HCWs. Goal 2 was to test a model of risk stemming from pandemic-related stressors and vulnerability factors. This cross-sectional study included HCWs (N = 2,246 [1,573 clinical providers;673 non-clinical staff]) in the Rocky Mountain West who voluntarily completed an online survey in April/May 2020. Respondents completed measures for traumatic stress symptoms, depression, anxiety, alcohol use, and sleep. Logistic regressions stratified by professional role (clinical versus non-clinical) were specified to predict clinical screening cutoff (positive/negative) as a function of five pandemic-related stressors (immunocompromised self;immunocompromised household member;care provision to infected patients;clinical management role;positive cases). Results showed that more than half of HCWs surveyed (52.5%) screened positive (above cutoff) for traumatic stress, depression, or anxiety, with ∼20% reporting problematic alcohol use, and variable insufficient sleep from ∼10% off shift to ∼50% on shift. Clinical employees with an immunocompromised household member had increased odds of screening positive for a mental health problem. Non-clinical HCWs who were immunocompromised were at elevated risk for screening positive a mental health problem. Being female, minority status, and younger increased odds for mental health problems. Implications include alleviating a portion of the mental health burden of HCWs involved in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by considering policies to protect immunocompromised HCWs and their families (e.g., vaccine priorities, telework options).","Smith, Andrew J.; Wright, Hannah Griffin Brandon J.; Ehman, Anandi C.; Shoji, Kotaro Love Tiffany M.; Morrow, Ellen Locke Amy Call Megan Kerig Patricia K.; Olff, Miranda Benight Charles C.; Langenecker, Scott A.","Brain, Behavior, &amp; Immunity - Health",,209
414360,Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic on Gastrointestinal Procedures and Cancers in the United States: A Multicenter Research Network Study,2021,"Background: Manifestations of Cushing disease, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity are risk factors for severe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease. A potential for severe COVID-19 disease might be hypothesized in Cushing disease patients. We present a finding of asymptomatic COVID-19 positive nasopharyngeal PCR test in an untreated Cushing disease patient. Case: A 19 year old female presented in January 2020 reporting amenorrhea and cushingoid facies. Her last menstrual period was two years ago. Low energy, fatigue, easy bruising and dark stretch marks on her legs, axillae and flanks were reported. Physical exam showed blood pressure 123/83 mmHg, pulse 89 bpm, BMI 20.80 kg/m². She had a cushingoid appearance with fullness in the face, neck and supraclavicular area, mild proptosis, pink cheeks and a few faint lavender striae on the inner thighs and flanks. Test results relevant to or supporting a diagnosis of Cushing disease included the following: 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test: AM cortisol 23.9 ug/dl (6.7-22.6 ug/dl). Random 1019 hrs AM ACTH was 32 pg/ml (&amp;lt;47 pg/ml), cortisol 6.5 ug/dl (4-22ug/dl). Repeat 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test: AM cortisol was 36.5 ug/dl (4-22 ug/dl), Dexamethasone 249.2 ng/dl (140-295 expected post 1 mg DXA the night before). 24 hr urine free cortisol was 391.4 (&amp;lt;=45.0 ug/d). Other endocrine labs were within normal limits. Left sided hypoenhancing lesion (2mmx2mmx2mm) consistent with pituitary microadenoma was seen on pituitary MRI. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling supported the presence of central disease and left pituitary location, concordant with the MRI. The time course from first clinical presentation to surgery was impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic temporarily halting elective surgical treatments and her access to care. At August, 2020 pre-op evaluation, the COVID-19 nasopharyngeal PCR was positive. Surgery was rescheduled. She denied symptoms of COVID-19 but recalled community exposure, including known COVID-19 positive contacts, while working as a waitress. Discussion: Increased susceptibility to and increased severity of COVID-19 manifestations might be feared in Cushing disease patients due to Cushing disease-associated immunosuppression, hyperglycemia, hypertension, obesity and venous thromboembolism. In contrast, randomized control trials have shown glucocorticoids, at doses sufficient to produce iatrogenic Cushing syndrome, may improve mortality in COVID-19 patients. Although asymptomatic COVID-19 infection is known to occur in young adults, the finding of asymptomatic COVID-19 positive test in a young woman with untreated Cushing disease also raises the possibility that endogenous hypercortisolism confers a similar benefit against severe manifestations of COVID-19 infection.","Mehfooz, Ayesha Araki Takako Burmeister Lynn Ann",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,209

415952,Severe ARDS in COVID-19-infected pregnancy: obstetric and intensive care considerations,2020,"Coronavirus infection is now the leading cause of death globally. Despite the several bedsides- to- bench investigations carried out by researchers all over the world to identify the best prophylactic and therapeutic options for this deadly virus, no novel vaccine or treatment drug has been developed. Accumulating evidence suggests that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV2) is associated with hyper inflammation characterized by excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines known as a cytokine storm. The hallmark of this unregulated inflammatory response includes viral sepsis, pneumonitis shock, coagulopathy, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which is the major cause of death in COVID-19 patients. In the midst of cytokine storm and coagulopathy, anti-viral agents alone will not provide the much needed therapeutic effect. Hence, the need to combine anti-inflammatory agents such as interferons, angiotensinogen converting enzyme (ACE) 2 inhibitors, interleukin- 6 (IL-6), and Janus kinase (JAK) family inhibitors, anticoagulants and other agents involved in inflammation resolution. This review critically presented a comprehensive overview of SAR-CoV2, unveiled the mechanisms of the inflammatory response in SARS-CoV2 and also highlighted possible specific prophylactic and therapeutic interventions that will circumvent inflammatory induced deaths in COVID -19 patients. Keywords: COVID-19; SARS-CoV2; cytokine storm; coagulopathy and anti-inflammatory.","Chukwuma, Ifeoma Felicia; Apeh, Victor Onukwube; C, Okwesilieze Frederick",Acta virol,,209

Here we review the history of PCR development and the technologies that have evolved from the original PCR method. Currently, there are two main areas of PCR utilization in bioscience: high-throughput PCR systems and microfluidics-based PCR devices for point-of-care (POC) applications. We also discuss the commercialization of these techniques and conclude with a look into their modifications and use in innovative areas of biomedicine. For example, real-time reverse transcription PCR is the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses. It could also be used for POC applications, being a key component of the sample-to-answer system.","Zhu, Hanliang; Zhang, Haoqing; Xu, Ying; Lassáková, Sona; Korabecná, Marie; Neuzil, Pavel",Biotechniques,,209

417512,"Global vascular surgeons' experience, stressors, and coping during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic",2020,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease that most commonly affects the lungs and is characterized by mucus retention and a continuous cycle of bacterial infection and inflammation. Current CF treatment strategies are focused on targeted drug delivery to the lungs. Novel inhalable drug therapies require an in vitro CF model that appropriately mimics the in vivo CF lung environment to better understand drug delivery and transport across the CF epithelium, and predict drug therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, the aim of this research was to determine the appropriate air-liquid interface (ALI) culture method of the CuFi-1 (CF cell line) compared to the NuLi-1 (healthy cell line) cells to be used as in vitro models of CF airway epithelia. Furthermore, drug transport on both CuFi-1 and NuLi-1 was investigated to determine whether these cell lines could be used to study transport of drugs used in CF treatment using Ibuprofen (the only anti-inflammatory drug currently approved for CF) as a model drug. Differentiating characteristics specific to airway epithelia such as mucus production, inflammatory response and tight junction formation at two seeding densities (Low and High) were assessed throughout an 8-week ALI culture period. This study demonstrated that both the NuLi-1 and CuFi-1 cell lines fully differentiate in ALI culture with significant mucus secretion, IL-6 and IL-8 production, and functional tight junctions at week 8. Additionally, the High seeding density was found to alter the phenotype of the NuLi-1 cell line. For the first time, this study identifies that ibuprofen is transported via the paracellular pathway in ALI models of NuLi-1 and CuFi-1 cell lines. Overall, these findings highlight that NuLi-1 and CuFi-1 as promising in vitro ALI models to investigate the transport properties of novel inhalable drug therapies for CF treatment.","Sheikh, Zara; Bradbury, Peta; Pozzoli, Michele; Young, Paul M; Xin Ong, Hui; Traini, Daniela",Eur. j. pharm. biopharm,,209

However, existing rumor detection methods are either limited to the strict relation of user responses or oversimplify the conversation structure. In this study, to substantially reinforces the interaction of user opinions while alleviating the negative impact imposed by irrelevant posts, we first represent the conversation thread as an undirected interaction graph. We then present a Claim-guided Hierarchical Graph Attention Network for rumor classification, which enhances the representation learning for responsive posts considering the entire social contexts and attends over the posts that can semantically infer the target claim. Extensive experiments on three Twitter datasets demonstrate that our rumor detection method achieves much better performance than state-of-the-art methods and exhibits a superior capacity for detecting rumors at early stages.","Lin, Hongzhan; Ma, Jing; Cheng, Mingfei; Yang, Zhiwei; Chen, Liangliang; Chen, Guang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04522v1.pdf,209

This article adopts this ontological perspective to explore the effects of the COVID-19 crisis on UK self-employed women and women-owned businesses through an intersectional lens accounting for race, class and gender. We argue that unequal health outcomes from COVID-19 are not solely biological; rather, they are also the outcome of social inequalities. Drawing upon the Wynterian elaboration of Fanon’s work on sociogeny – the shaping of the embodied human experience by the norms of given society – to explain this phenomenon, we contend that the same inequalities emerging in health outcomes will be reflected in entrepreneurship and self-employment. Drawing on Labour Force Survey data for the past decade, we peer through the Wynterian prism of bios and mythoi to argue that marginalised entrepreneurs are likely to experience extreme precarity due to COVID-19 and so require targeted support.","Martinez Dy, Angela; Jayawarna, Dilani",Int.

We aimed to evaluate the psychological distress associated with work-related experiences among medical professionals and supporting staff during the pandemic outbreak. Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between April and May 2020, employing a self-administered on-line questionnaire that included the collection of socio-demographic and professional status information, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Maslach Burnout Inventory - General Survey, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and a subscale of the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) for empathy. A total of 364 professionals of the county-coordinated area responded. Descriptive statistics summarized the findings and a mediation model was analyzed, applying the causal step strategy. The specific direct and causal mediation effects were estimated with the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap sampling method. Results: Anxiety, burnout, stress, resilience, and empathy proved to be significantly associated with both the professional category (ie, consultant, specialty doctor, trainee doctor, senior nurse, trainee nurse or other) and the perceived professional support (the nonparametric multivariate permutation test resulted in p=0.048 and p&lt;0.001, respectively). When controlling for the marital and professional status, the female gender had an OR=2.26, 95% CI (1.21;4.22) toward a high level of empathy compared to males. The causal mediation effect of the perceived lack of professional support on empathy through burnout-depersonalization was highly significant (p&lt;0.001) with an average of 0.0599, 95% CI (0.0238;0.10), while the direct effect was non-significant (p=0.536) with an average of 0.0295, 95% CI (-0.0774;0.15). Conclusion: We highlighted the impact of the lack of professional support on healthcare workers' empathy through burnout-depersonalization in a context of a high workload, time pressure, job stress beyond previous training, and inherently limited organizational support, which are potentially modifiable factors in the mid-term.","Bredicean, C.; Tamasan, S.

The long quarantine that the COVID 19 pandemic imposed on most countries of the world has brought radical changes in the way schools, colleges and universities operate. In Algerian higher education, creating online platforms for students was the only solution to move on. However, ignoring that most Algerian students often go online for self-entertainment may lead to a failure or an incomplete success of online teaching during this critical period. To investigate this issue, a questionnaire with only open-ended questions was designed and distributed to 35 students of Language and Communication master, at the English department of Abdelhamid Ibn Badis University. The 35 participants were the researcher's students in the classes of e-learning. Results showed that most participants were distracted by social media notifications. Also, it turned out that the 35 students had no idea of what digital minimalism or digital maximalism is.

Antibodies were screened on HEK293 cells transfected with viral nucleoprotein, S1 subunit and S2 subunit of spike protein and on untransfected cells, as well as a panel of normal tissue. Lung tissue with presence of SARS-CoV2 confirmed by in situ hybridization (ISH) was also used. A total of 7 mAbs were tested: (1) mAb 001 (Sino Biological, 40143-R001), (2) mAb 007 (Sino Biological, 40150-R007), (3) mAb 019 (Sino Biological, 40143-R019), (4) mAb 1A9 (GeneTex, GTX632604), (5) mAb ABM19C9 (Abeomics, 10-10007), (6) FIPV3-70 (Santa Cruz, SC-65653), and (7) mAb 6F10 (BioVision, A2060). Only 2 mAbs, clone 001 to the nucleoprotein and clone 1A9 to the S2 subunit spike protein displayed specific immunoreactivity. Both clones showed strong staining in the acute phase of COVID-19 pneumonia, mostly in areas of acute diffuse alveolar damage, but were not completely congruent. Viral protein was also found in kidney tubules, endothelia of multiple organs and a nasal swab of a patient with persistent SARS-CoV2 infection. The other tested reagents were either poorly reactive or demonstrated nonspecific staining in tissues and lesions not infected by SARS-CoV2. Our study demonstrates that rigid specificity testing is mandatory for the evaluation of mAbs to SARS-CoV2 and that clones 001 to nucleoprotein and 1A9 to S2 subunit spike protein are useful for the in situ detection of SARS-CoV2.","Szabolcs, Matthias; Sauter, Jennifer L; Frosina, Denise; Geronimo, Jerica A; Hernandez, Enmily; Selbs, Elena; Rapkiewicz, Amy V; Rekhtman, Natasha; Baine, Marina K; Jäger, Elke; Travis, William D; Jungbluth, Achim A",Appl. immunohistochem. mol. morphol,,209

431180,Prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in coronavirus disease 2019: a meta-analysis,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has necessitated the reduction in conventional face-to-face patient consultation to reduce the risk of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Traditional pathways to risk assess for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) would involve face-to-face assessment to formulate an appropriate management plan following an initial presentation usually in secondary care or in-hospital settings. Appropriate antithrombotic measures can prevent complication of DVT such as pulmonary embolism with prompt early diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: This observational, pilot study evaluates the possibility of combining telemedicine technology and a virtual examination pathway for remote triage and assessment of patients with suspected DVT. RESULTS: Piloting and development of a virtual risk assessment pathway for DVT involves various challenges and multidisciplinary co-ordination. CONCLUSION: Advances in telecommunication technology can enable clinicians, specialist nurses and hospital departments to develop a virtual examination pathway for remote triage and assessment of patients with suspected DVT. This pathway is not a replacement for conventional 'face-to-face' evaluation, but we believe the template can be explored and refined to act as a blueprint for future applications even when the pandemic has stabilised.","Iyengar, Karthikeyan P; Jain, Vijay Kumar; Soni, Manjusha; Hakim, Zuned",Postgrad. med. j,,209

At present, little is known about factors that will affect vaccine uptake, especially among diverse racial/ethnic communities that have experienced the highest burden of COVID. We administered an online survey to a Qualtrics respondent panel of women ages 27-45 years (N = 396) to assess vaccine intentions and attitudes, and trusted vaccine information sources. 56.8% intended to be vaccinated and 25.5% were unsure. In bivariate analyses, a greater percentage of non-Latina White (NLW) and Chinese women reported that they would be vaccinated, compared with Latina and non-Latina Black (NLB) women (p < 0.001). Those who were uninsured, unemployed and those with lower incomes were less likely to say that they would be vaccinated. In analyses stratified by race/ethnicity, NLB women remained significantly less likely to report that they would be vaccinated compared with NLW women (adjusted odds ratio: 0.47; 95% confidence interval: 0.23, 0.94), controlling for age, marital status, income, education, employment, and insurance status. When analyses were additionally controlled for beliefs in vaccine safety and efficacy, racial/ethnic differences were no longer significant (adjusted odds ratio: 0.64; 95% confidence interval: 0.31, 1.34). Given that NLB women were less likely to report the intention to be vaccinated, targeted efforts will be needed to promote vaccine uptake. It will be critical to emphasize that the vaccine is safe and effective; this message may be best delivered by trusted community members.","Allen, Jennifer D; Abuelezam, Nadia N; Rose, Rebecca; Fontenot, Holly B",Transl Behav Med,,209

439463,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Accompanied by Maculopapular Rash: A Case Study,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is disproportionately burdening racial and ethnic minority groups in the US. Higher risks of infection and mortality among racialized minorities are a consequence of structural racism, reflected in specific policies that date back centuries and persist today. Yet, our surveillance activities do not reflect what we know about how racism structures risk. When measuring racial and ethnic disparities in deaths due to COVID-19, the CDC statistically accounts for the geographic distribution of deaths throughout the US to reflect the fact that deaths are concentrated in areas with different racial and ethnic distributions than that of the larger US. In this commentary, we argue that such an approach misses an important driver of disparities in COVID-19 mortality, namely the historical forces that determine where individuals live, work, and play, and consequently determine their risk of dying from COVID-19. We explain why controlling for geography downplays the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on racialized minority groups in the US. Finally, we offer recommendations for the analysis of surveillance data to estimate racial disparities, including shifting from distribution-based to risk-based measures, to help inform a more effective and equitable public health response to the pandemic.","Zalla, Lauren C; Martin, Chantel L; Edwards, Jessie K; Gartner, Danielle R; Noppert, Grace A",Am. j. epidemiol,,209

444075,Continuous Negative Pressure Operative Field Barrier for Combined Open Tracheostomy and Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy Tube Placement During Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"Purpose: During the COVID-19 pandemic, nonessential procedures were indefinitely deferred, including normally scheduled percutaneous drain injections, exchanges, removals, and repositioning (1). In these circumstances, telephonic and video-based follow-up have been substituted for traditional in-person care models at our institution’s interventional radiology (IR) clinic. The purpose of this study was to assess patient perceptions and attitudes regarding virtual IR visits compared to traditional in-person visits as data on the patient experience of this care model is currently limited. Materials and Methods: In this study, we enrolled all patients with a percutaneous drain placed by IR and scheduled for follow-up during the deferral period (March 19, 2020 to April 17, 2020). An internally validated survey was administered by telephone to patients assessing their experience of the virtual visit. The survey contained 25 items with closed-ended responses in addition to the opportunity for open-ended comments and reflections at the conclusion of the survey. Results: This study enrolled 54 patients (with 55 total drains) who were affected by the nonessential procedure deferral due to COVID-19. 20.3% of patients agreed to participate in the study. The mean age of respondents was 62.8 ± 20.0 years, and 8 respondents (72.7%) were male. There were an equal number of telephone and video-based visits. Patients perceived many benefits to virtual visits including increased access to care (81.8%), quicker time to appointment scheduling (88.9%), shorter waiting room wait time (77.8%), access to appointments when in-person appointments were not available due to COVID-19 (100%), and reduced transportation time (100%). 81.8% of patients reported no anxiety when compared to in-person visits. 90.9% of patients reported that they would be definitely interested in using virtual visits in the future. Conclusions: Both telephone and videoconferencing based virtual visits improved access to patient care when precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic limited in-person drain management. More comprehensive data may be required to evaluate the appropriateness and impact of virtual visits and deferred in-person drain management procedures on patient outcomes and future care models.","Panagides, J.; Nambiar, N.; Chittle, M.; Salazar, G.; Daye, D.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,,209

446114,The Effect of Coronavirus Disease 2019 on Cardiovascular Diseases/ O Efeito da Doença de Coronavírus 2019 nas Doenças Cardiovasculares,2020,"The Health Opportunity Index (HOI) is a multivariate tool that can be more efficiently used to identify and understand the interplay of complex social determinants of health (SDH) at the census tract level that influences the ability to achieve optimal health. The derivation of the HOI utilizes the data-reduction technique of principal component analysis to determine the impact of SDH on optimal health at lower census geographies. In the midst of persistent health disparities and the present COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrate the potential utility of using 13-input variables to derive a composite metric of health (HOI) score as a means to assist in the identification of the most vulnerable communities during the current pandemic. Using GIS mapping technology, health opportunity indices were layered by counties in Ohio to highlight differences by census tract. Collectively we demonstrate that our HOI framework, principal component analysis and convergence analysis methodology coalesce to provide results supporting the utility of this framework in the three largest counties in Ohio: Franklin (Columbus), Cuyahoga (Cleveland), and Hamilton (Cincinnati). The results in this study identified census tracts that were also synonymous with communities that were at risk for disparate COVID-19 related health outcomes. In this regard, convergence analyses facilitated identification of census tracts where different disparate health outcomes co-exist at the worst levels. Our results suggest that effective use of the HOI composite score and subcomponent scores to identify specific SDH can guide mitigation/intervention practices, thus creating the potential for better targeting of mitigation and intervention strategies for vulnerable communities, such as during the current pandemic.","Ogojiaku, Chinonso N; Allen, J C; Anson-Dwamena, Rexford; Barnett, Kierra S; Adetona, Olorunfemi; Im, Wansoo; Hood, Darryl B",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,209

Use of ACE inhibitors or sartans was not associated with outcomes. Among 128 swab negative patients at admission (63.3% males) median age was 67.7 years (range 1-98). Chest CT was performed in 87 (68%) and showed interstitial pneumonia in 76 (87.3%). Follow-up swab turned positive in 13 of 32 patients. Using chest CT at admission as gold standard on the entire study population of 539 patients, nasopharyngeal swab had 80% accuracy. Comorbidity network analysis revealed a more homogenous distribution 60-40 aged SARS-COV-2 patients across diseases and a crucial different interplay of diseases in the networks of deceased and survived patients. SARS-CoV-2 caused high mortality among patients older than 60 years and correlated with pre-existing multiorgan impairment.","Gili, Tommaso; Benelli, Giampaolo; Buscarini, Elisabetta; Canetta, Ciro; La Piana, Giuseppe; Merli, Guido; Scartabellati, Alessandro; Viganò, Giovanni; Sfogliarini, Roberto; Melilli, Giovanni; Assandri, Roberto; Cazzato, Daniele; Rossi, Davide Sebastiano; Usai, Susanna; Caldarelli, Guido; Tramacere, Irene; Pellegata, Germano; Lauria, Giuseppe",PLoS One,,209

This cross-sectional research study aimed to explore the social media use and characteristics of Generation Z in nursing students and to identify what were the most useful and preferred teaching methods during clinical training. Participants were Generation Z nursing degree students from a Spanish Higher Education Institution. A 41-item survey was developed and validated by an expert panel. The consecutive sample consisted of 120 students. Participants used social media for an average of 1.37 h (SD = 1.15) for clinical learning. They preferred, as teaching methods, linking mentorship learning to clinical experiences (x¯ = 3.51, SD = 0.88), online tutorials or videos (x¯ = 3.22, SD = 0.78), interactive gaming (x¯ = 3.09, SD = 1.14), and virtual learning environments (x¯ = 3, SD = 1.05).

Using a matched-pairs sample of mothers and fathers, path analyses were conducted to test the hypothesized relations. RESULTS: Moderation analyses revealed that high levels of familism weakened the link between workplace discrimination and parents' depressive symptoms, whereas high levels of parent-youth conflict exacerbated the association to parents' psychosocial well-being. There was variation by parent gender, with parent-youth conflict being more strongly associated with fathers' self-esteem than mothers'. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that Mexican-origin parents' familism can mitigate and family conflict can exacerbate the risks of workplace discrimination on parents' psychosocial well-being.

452961,Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection Among Medical Staff in Wuhan: A Retrospective Study From a Single Center,2020,"To manage the COVID-19 epidemic effectively, decision-makers in public health need accurate forecasts of case numbers. A potential near real-time predictor of future case numbers is human mobility; however, research on the predictive power of mobility is lacking. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel model for epidemic forecasting based on mobility data, called mobility marked Hawkes model. The proposed model consists of three components: (1) A Hawkes process captures the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. (2) A mark modulates the rate of infections, thus accounting for how the reproduction number R varies across space and time. The mark is modeled using a regularized Poisson regression based on mobility covariates. (3) A correction procedure incorporates new cases seeded by people traveling between regions. Our model was evaluated on the COVID-19 epidemic in Switzerland. Specifically, we used mobility data from February through April 2020, amounting to approximately 1.5 billion trips. Trip counts were derived from large-scale telecommunication data, i.e., cell phone pings from the Swisscom network, the largest telecommunication provider in Switzerland. We compared our model against various state-of-the-art baselines in terms of out-of-sample root mean squared error. We found that our model outperformed the baselines by 15.52%. The improvement was consistently achieved across different forecast horizons between 5 and 21 days. In addition, we assessed the predictive power of conventional point of interest data, confirming that telecommunication data is superior. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to predict the spread of COVID-19 from telecommunication data. Altogether, our work contributes to previous research by developing a scalable early warning system for decision-makers in public health tasked with controlling the spread of infectious diseases.","Schwabe, Amray; Persson, Joel; Feuerriegel, Stefan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00356v1.pdf,209

456602,"Distribution, infrastructure, and expertise of heart failure and cardio-oncology clinics in a developing network: temporal evolution and challenges during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic",2020,"Introduction: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis is well known as a life-threatening condition in immunocompromised risk groups and has been implicated in the development of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP). We present a unique case of CMV pneumonitis confounded by COP related to a recent SARS-Coronavirus 19 (COVID19) infection. It is important for clinicians to recognize underlying red herrings or potential anchoring bias in the differential of COVID19 sequelae including secondary opportunistic infections. Description: A fifty-five year old gentleman presented with fevers, cough, dyspnea, and myalgias for nine days which progressed to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed diffuse ground glass airspace disease with hilar lymphadenopathy and left lower basal consolidation (Figure 1). Diagnostic differentials considered included community acquired pneumonia and COVID19 bronchopneumonia. Empiric antibiotics, Anakinra, and systemic steroids were started. Initial microbiologic studies were negative for bacterial, fungal or viral etiologies, as were serologic testing for autoimmune diseases. COVID19 nucleic acid amplification probes were negative on five separate swabs. The patient failed to clinically improve and ultimately was referred for surgical lung biopsy. The biopsy revealed intranuclear viral inclusions and findings of chronic fibrosing interstitial organizing pneumonia with CMV pneumonitis. Serum CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed a viral load of 2,520 IU/mL and COVID-19 specific serum IgG was later found to be positive. The patient was treated with therapeutic dose of ganciclovir for two weeks and given a longer steroid course for the organizing pneumonia. After a prolonged hospital stay, the patient was discharged home with tapered prednisone and supplemental oxygen. Discussion: The coexistence of COVID19 and CMV pneumonitis has reported to date in one other case to our knowledge (1,3). We hypothesize that COVID19 infection as evidenced by positive IgG could have served as the inciting event leading to the development of organizing pneumonia. Systemic steroids can induce a relative immunosuppressed state which predisposes to opportunistic infections like CMV pneumonitis. Alternatively, CMV can reactivate in critically ill patients (2). Of note, this case demonstrates the perils of confounding diagnoses and anchoring bias as our patient likely failed to respond clinically to systemic steroid therapy for COP while secondarily infected with CMV. This case highlights the need to consider other possible confounders in the diagnostic differential for COVID19 sequalae when patients are not responding adequately to empiric treatment and to evaluate more histopathologic or post-mortem examinations of COVID19 patients.","Khosa, J.; Jun, I.

We analyzed death and nasopharyngeal viral kinetics in 655 hospitalized patients from the prospective French COVID cohort. The model predicted a median peak viral load that coincided with symptom onset. Patients with age &#8805;65 y had a smaller loss rate of infected cells, leading to a delayed median time to viral clearance occurring 16 d after symptom onset as compared to 13 d in younger patients (P < 10-4). In multivariate analysis, the risk factors associated with mortality were age &#8805;65 y, male gender, and presence of chronic pulmonary disease (hazard ratio [HR] > 2.0). Using a joint model, viral dynamics after hospital admission was an independent predictor of mortality (HR = 1.31, P < 10-3). Finally, we used our model to simulate the effects of effective pharmacological interventions on time to viral clearance and mortality. A treatment able to reduce viral production by 90% upon hospital admission would shorten the time to viral clearance by 2.0 and 2.9 d in patients of age <65 y and &#8805;65 y, respectively. Assuming that the association between viral dynamics and mortality would remain similar to that observed in our population, this could translate into a reduction of mortality from 19 to 14% in patients of age &#8805;65 y with risk factors. Our results show that viral dynamics is associated with mortality in hospitalized patients. Strategies aiming to reduce viral load could have an effect on mortality rate in this population.","Néant, Nadège; Lingas, Guillaume; Le Hingrat, Quentin; Ghosn, Jade; Engelmann, Ilka; Lepiller, Quentin; Gaymard, Alexandre; Ferré, Virginie; Hartard, Cédric; Plantier, Jean-Christophe; Thibault, Vincent; Marlet, Julien; Montes, Brigitte; Bouiller, Kevin; Lescure, François-Xavier; Timsit, Jean-François; Faure, Emmanuel; Poissy, Julien; Chidiac, Christian; Raffi, François; Kimmoun, Antoine; Etienne, Manuel; Richard, Jean-Christophe; Tattevin, Pierre; Garot, Denis; Le Moing, Vincent; Bachelet, Delphine; Tardivon, Coralie; Duval, Xavier; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Mentré, France; Laouénan, Cédric; Visseaux, Benoit; Guedj, Jérémie",Proc.

460319,Limiting positive end-expiratory pressure to protect renal function in SARS-CoV-2 critically ill patients,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 has exploded throughout the human population. To facilitate efforts to gain insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology and to target the virus therapeutically, it is essential to have a roadmap of likely functional regions embedded in its RNA genome. In this report, we used a bioinformatics approach, ScanFold, to deduce the local RNA structural landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with the highest likelihood of being functional. We recapitulate previously-known elements of RNA structure and provide a model for the folding of an essential frameshift signal. Our results find that SARS-CoV-2 is greatly enriched in unusually stable and likely evolutionarily ordered RNA structure, which provides a large reservoir of potential drug targets for RNA-binding small molecules. Results are enhanced via the re-analyses of publicly-available genome-wide biochemical structure probing datasets that are broadly in agreement with our models. Additionally, ScanFold was updated to incorporate experimental data as constraints in the analysis to facilitate comparisons between ScanFold and other RNA modelling approaches. Ultimately, ScanFold was able to identify eight highly structured/conserved motifs in SARS-CoV-2 that agree with experimental data, without explicitly using these data. All results are made available via a public database (the RNAStructuromeDB: https://structurome.bb.iastate.edu/sars-cov-2) and model comparisons are readily viewable at https://structurome.bb.iastate.edu/sars-cov-2-global-model-comparisons.","Andrews, R.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 6th to April 22nd 2020, all consecutive adult patients referred to the ""Covid-19 clinic"" of our Emergency Department with the availability of chest CT and of at least one RT-PCR result were retrospectively included in the present study. Chest CT was considered positive when typical Covid-19 lesions were observed (bilateral and predominantly peripheral and sub-pleural ground glass opacities and/or alveolar consolidations). RT-PCR results were considered as the reference standard. Ascending, peak and descending phases were determined based on the number of CT scans performed daily. CT diagnostic performance were calculated and variations between phases were tested for equivalence or difference using Bayesian methods. RESULTS: 2194 consecutive chest CT were analyzed. Overall CT diagnostic performance was Se = 84.2 [82.0 ; 86.3], Sp = 86.6 [84.5 ; 88.5], PPV = 86.1 [84.0 ; 88.1], NPV = 84.7 [82.6 ; 86.7] and accuracy = 85.4 [83.9 ; 86.8], with no significant differences between chest and non-chest radiologists. Variations between the ascending (11 days, 281 chest CT, disease prevalence 37.0 %), the peak (18 days, 1167 chest CT, disease prevalence 64 %) and the descending phases (19 days, 746 chest CT, disease prevalence 32.2 %) were highest for PPV and NPV with a probability of difference >99.9 %, and smallest for accuracy and specificity with a probability of equivalence >98.8 %. CONCLUSION: In a homogenous cohort of 2194 consecutive chest CT performed over a 7-week epidemic wave, we observed significant variations of CT predictive values whereas CT specificity appeared marginally affected.","Ohana, Mickaël; Muller, Joris; Severac, François; Bilbault, Pascal; Behr, Martin; Oberlin, Mathieu; Leyendecker, Pierre; Roy, Catherine",Eur J Radiol,,209

Mask mandate introduction was staggered from mid-June to mid-August 2020 in the 34 public health regions in Ontario, Canada's largest province by population. Using this variation, we find that mask mandates are associated with a 22 percent weekly reduction in new COVID-19 cases, relative to the trend in absence of mandate. Province-level data provide corroborating evidence. We control for mobility behaviour using Google geo-location data and for lagged case totals and case growth as information variables. Our analysis of additional survey data shows that mask mandates led to an increase of about 27 percentage points in self-reported mask wearing in public. Counterfactual policy simulations suggest that adopting a nationwide mask mandate in June could have reduced the total number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases in Canada by over 50,000 over the period July-November 2020. Jointly, our results indicate that mandating mask wearing in indoor public places can be a powerful policy tool to slow the spread of COVID-19.","Karaivanov, Alexander; Lu, Shih En; Shigeoka, Hitoshi; Chen, Cong; Pamplona, Stephanie",J Health Econ,,209

However, it is difficult to trace people who came into contact with an infected person, which causes widespread community transmission and mass infection. To address this problem, we develop an e-government mobile and fog computing framework that can trace positive and suspected cases nationwide. We use personal mobile devices with contact tracing apps and stationary fog nodes, named Automatic Risk Checkers (ARC), to ensure user privacy. Each user's mobile device receives a Unique Encrypted Reference Code (UERC) when registering on the central application. The mobile device and the central application both generate Rotational Unique Encrypted Reference Code (RUERC) every two hours, and this RUERC is broadcasted using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. Any nearby mobile device can receive the RUERC and record it for the next up to 21 days. As the government maintains the database of server-generated UERCs and contains a mapping between UERC and RUERC, the users' mobile devices can store the RUERC in the application cache without requiring further encryption. Additionally, if any cases are found, the ARCs broadcast pre-cautionary messages to nearby people without revealing the identity of the infected person. This way, governments can let organizations continue their economic activities without complete lockdown. Further, it becomes viable to identify super spreaders and to map the cluster of infected and suspected cases.","Whaiduzzaman, Md; Hossain, Md Razon; Shovon, Ahmedur Rahman; Roy, Shanto; Laszka, Aron; Buyya, Rajkumar; Barros, Alistair",IEEE j. biomed. health inform.

The focus of this study is a systematic review of published information to identify and characterize scenarios and hazards in the future of work. Eleven bibliographic databases were systematically searched for papers and reports published from 1999 to 2019 that described future of work scenarios or identified future work-related hazards. To compile a comprehensive collection of views of the future, supplemental and ad hoc searches were also performed. After screening all search records against a set of predetermined criteria, the review yielded 36 references (17 peer-reviewed, 4 gray, and 15 supplemental) containing scenarios. In these, the future of work was described along multiple conceptual axes (e.g. labor market changes, societal values, and manual versus cognitive work). Technology was identified as the primary driver of the future of work in most scenarios, and there were divergent views in the literature as to whether technology will create more or fewer jobs than it displaces. Workforce demographics, globalization, climate change, economic conditions, and urbanization were also mentioned as influential factors. Other important themes included human enhancement, social isolation, loneliness, worker monitoring, advanced manufacturing, hazardous exposures, sustainability, biotechnology, and synthetic biology. Pandemics have not been widely considered in the future of work literature, but the recent COVID-19 pandemic illustrates that was short-sighted. Pandemics may accelerate future of work trends and merit critical consideration in scenario development. Many scenarios described 'new' or 'exacerbated' psychosocial hazards of work, whereas comparatively fewer discussed physical, chemical, or biological hazards. Various preventive recommendations were identified. In particular, reducing stress associated with precarious work and its requirements of continual skill preparation and training was acknowledged as critical for protecting and promoting the health and well-being of the future workforce. In conclusion, the future of work will be comprised of diverse complex scenarios and a mosaic of old and new hazards. These findings may serve as the basis for considering how to shape the future of work.","Schulte, Paul A; Streit, Jessica M K; Sheriff, Fatima; Delclos, George; Felknor, Sarah A; Tamers, Sara L; Fendinger, Sherry; Grosch, James; Sala, Robert",Ann Work Expo Health,,209
468212,Challenges of facing coronavirus disease 2019: Psychiatric services for patients with mental disorders,2020,"Pathogens in droplets on fomites and aerosols go through extreme physiochemical conditions, such as confinement and osmotic stress, due to evaporation. Still, these droplets are the predominant transmission routes of many contagious diseases. The biggest challenge for studying the survival mechanisms of pathogens in extreme conditions is closely observing them, especially in aerosols, due to the small droplet sizes, movements, and fast evaporative dynamics. To mimic evaporating aerosols and microdroplets, we employ microfluidic emulsion droplets. The presence of oil forms a microdroplet cluster with spatially gradient evaporation rates, which helps studying the impact of evaporation and its rate. With Escherichia coli, we show that the viability is adversely affected by the evaporation and its rate. Our method can mimic bioaerosol evaporation with controlled number of cells inside. In general, the droplets can act as microreactors with varying kinetics induced by different evaporation rates.","Gopu, Maheshwar; Agrawal, Akanksha; Mukherjee, Raju; Mampallil, Dileep",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03564v1.pdf,209

So, we must set up effective and useful zoning for unfamiliar COVID-19 because it is the most important to prevent spread of infection to and from medical staffs or other patients and patients relies on effective use of standard precaution with personal protective equipment (PPE). Method: We set up a special ward changed a general ward we always used as an acute care unit for severe COVID-19 patients with taking into consideration airflow, the direction of movement of medical staffs, and prevention of infection spread to medical staffs and other patients. And, we checked daily condition and body temperature of all medical staffs for 60 days. Result: There were no evidence of COVID-19 infection in all medical staffs and patients during the period thanks to effective and useful zoning with PPE. Conclusion: We should set up the special wards and rooms with some devices for the time to come due to protect medical staffs and other patients, and prevent from the explosion of COVID-19 anywhere with effective and useful zoning with PPE.","Ogawa, Fumihiro; Kato, Hideaki; Sakai, Kazuya; Nakamura, Kana; Ogawa, Mizuki; Uchiyama, Munehito; Nakajima, Kento; Ohyama, Yutaro; Abe, Takeru; Takeuchi, Ichiro",Acute Med.

469366,Systematic review of the registered clinical trials for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"Corona Virus 2019 Disease (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging pandemic caused by a newly discovered beta coronavirus, called Sever Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). SARS CoV-2 is an enveloped, single stranded RNA virus that depends on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to replicate. Therefore, SARS CoV-2 RdRp is considered as a promising target to cease virus replication. SARS CoV-2 polymerase shows high structural similarity to Hepatitis C Virus-1b genotype (HCV-1b) polymerase. Arising from the high similarity between SARS CoV-2 RdRp and HCV NS5B, we utilized the reported small-molecule binders to the palm subdomain of HCV NS5B (genotype 1b) to generate a high-quality DEKOIS 2.0 benchmark set and conducted a benchmarking analysis against HCV NS5B. The three highly cited and publicly available docking tools AutoDock Vina, FRED and PLANTS were benchmarked. Based on the benchmarking results and analysis via pROC-Chemotype plot, PLANTS showed the best screening performance and can recognize potent binders at the early enrichment. Accordingly, we used PLANTS in a prospective virtual screening to repurpose both the FDA-approved drugs (DrugBank) and the HCV-NS5B palm subdomain binders (BindingDB) for SARS CoV-2 RdRp palm subdomain. Further assessment by molecular dynamics simulations for 50 ns recommended diosmin (from DrugBank) and compound 3 (from BindingDB) to be the best potential binders to SARS CoV-2 RdRp palm subdomain. The best predicted compounds are recommended to be biologically investigated against COVID-19. In conclusion, this work provides in-silico analysis to propose possible SARS CoV-2 RdRp palm subdomain binders recommended as a remedy for COVID-19. Up-to-our knowledge, this study is the first to propose binders at the palm subdomain of SARS CoV2 RdRp. Furthermore, this study delivers an example of how to make use of a high quality custom-made DEKOIS 2.0 benchmark set as a procedure to elevate the virtual screening success rate against a vital target of the rapidly emerging pandemic.","Elghoneimy, Laila K; Ismail, Muhammad I; Boeckler, Frank M; Azzazy, Hassan M E; Ibrahim, Tamer M",Comput Biol Med,,209

However, less is known about how identifying something as an animate agent shapes specific inferences about its internal properties. Here, we test whether preschool children (N = 92; North American population) have specifically biological expectations about animate agents, or if they have more general expectations that animate agents should have an internal source of motion. We presented preschoolers with videos of two puppets: a ""self-propelled"" fur-covered puppet, and a fur-covered puppet that is seen to be moved by a human actor. In addition, we presented preschoolers with images of a familiar artifact (motorcycle) and familiar animal (sheep). For each item, we asked them to choose what they thought was inside each of these entities: nothing, biological insides, or mechanical insides. Preschoolers were less likely to say that a self-propelled fur-covered object was empty, compared to a fur-covered object that was moved by a human actor, which converges with past work with infants. However, preschoolers showed no specifically biological expectations about these objects, despite being able to accurately match biological insides to familiar animals and mechanical insides to familiar artifacts on the follow-up measure. These results suggest that preschoolers do not have specifically biological expectations about animate agents as a category, but rather general expectations that such agents should not be empty inside.","Kominsky, Jonathan F; Shafto, Patrick; Bonawitz, Elizabeth",PLoS One,,209

Metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics analyses showed that the M3 method for viral enrichment was superior in both viral sequencing composition and viral taxa when compared to M1, M2, and M4. M3 acquired the most viral reads and more complete sequences within 15-h performance, indicating that it might be feasible for viral detection in multiple respiratory samples in clinical practice. Based on sequence similarity analysis, 12 human viruses, including nine Anelloviruses and three coronaviruses, were characterized. Coronavirus OC43 with the largest number of viral reads accounted for nearly complete (99.8%) genome sequences, indicating that it may be a major viral pathogen involved in exacerbation of COPD.","Liu, Bo; Shao, Nan; Wang, Jing; Zhou, SiYu; Su, HaoXiang; Dong, Jie; Sun, LiLian; Li, Li; Zhang, Ting; Yang, Fan",Front Microbiol,,209

Currently, nasopharyngeal swabbing (NPS) is the standard method for collecting specimens. Saliva was recently proposed as an easy and safe option with many authorities adopting the methodology despite the limited evidence of efficacy. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to systematically evaluate the current literature on the use of saliva test for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and carry out a meta-analysis to determine its diagnostic accuracy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective studies were searched for in electronic databases, complemented by hand-searching relevant journals. The risk of bias and applicability were assessed using the revised Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Meta-analyses and meta-regression modeling were performed to calculate the diagnostic accuracy and examine sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies were included with 2928 paired samples. The overall meta-analysis showed a high sensitivity and specificity for saliva test at 0.88 (95% CI 0.82-0.92) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.75-0.98), respectively. The diagnostic odds ratio was calculated at 87 (95% CI 19-395) and area under the curve was calculated as 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.94) suggesting very good performance of the saliva tests in detecting SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: Saliva testing has a very good discriminative and diagnostic ability to detect of SARS-CoV-2. Additional large and well-designed prospective studies are needed to further validate the diagnostic accuracy and determine a safe sample collection method prior to its recommendation for mass application. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Saliva demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity. The use of saliva will allow for self-collection of specimens and specimen collection in outpatient and community clinics.","Atieh, Momen A; Guirguis, Marina; Alsabeeha, Nabeel H M; Cannon, Richard D",Oral dis,,209

METHODS: A total of 65 ambulatory patients with SLE and 9 healthy controls underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scanning, for quantitative assessment of BBB permeability. Volumetric data were extracted using the VolBrain pipeline. Global cognitive function was evaluated using a screening battery consisting of tasks falling into five broad cognitive domains, and was compared between patients with normal versus extensive BBB leakage. RESULTS: Patients with SLE had significantly higher levels of BBB leakage compared with controls (p=0.04). Extensive BBB leakage (affecting over >9% of brain volume) was identified only in patients with SLE (16/65; 24.6%), who also had smaller right and left cerebral grey matter volumes compared with controls (p=0.04). Extensive BBB leakage was associated with lower global cognitive scores (p=0.02), and with the presence of impairment on one or more cognitive tasks (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence for a link between extensive BBB leakage and changes in both brain structure and cognitive function in patients with SLE. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms underlying BBB-mediated cognitive impairment, validate the diagnostic utility of BBB imaging, and determine the potential of targeting the BBB as a therapeutic strategy in patients with SLE.","Kamintsky, Lyna; Beyea, Steven D; Fisk, John D; Hashmi, Javeria A; Omisade, Antonina; Calkin, Cynthia; Bardouille, Tim; Bowen, Chris; Quraan, Maher; Mitnitski, Arnold; Matheson, Kara; Friedman, Alon; Hanly, John G",Ann. rheum. dis,,209

Catching and introducing the wrong needle resulted in a knot formed around the right adnexa. DESIGN: A step-by-step demonstration of the mistake and technique to correct it. SETTING: A Para 0+V patient with cervical insufficiency was managed with laparoscopic interval cerclage [1,2,3]. The patient's two most recent pregnancies had been managed with emergency transvaginal cerclage, which failed to prolong her gestation beyond 24 weeks. INTERVENTIONS: Prior to the cerclage procedure a 2.0â¯×â¯0.8cm deep endometriotic nodule was excised. Both curved needles were straightened extracorporeally, and the tape was dropped inside the peritoneal cavity. The 1st needle was introduced successfully through the right side. After insertion of - what was believed to be - the same needle through the left side following the opposite direction, it was discovered that a tight knot had been formed around the right adnexa (Figure 1). To avoid complete removal, the needles-less tape was pulled back completely from the right side (Supplemental Figure 1), and this end was stitched to a straight needle 2-0 polyglactin suture. The much thinner needle passed easily through the already created path, along with the tape (Supplemental Figure 2), and the procedure was completed as planned (Supplemental Figure 3). CONCLUSION: When performing laparoscopic cervical cerclage with the tape and needles inside the abdomen it is important to keep both under constant view. In the event of mis-placement, no need to completely remove the tape.

On March 12th, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced it as a global pandemic. Early diagnosis of atypical cases of COVID-19 infection is critical in reducing the transmission and controlling the present pandemic. In the present report, we described a patient with the chief complaints of dyspnea and dry cough referred to the oncology center at Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran with the differential diagnosis of lung cancer who was diagnosed and treated for COVID-19 infection in follow up. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old patient complained of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea from two weeks ago. The patient had been referred to this center with the differential diagnosis of lung cancer due to the massive pleural effusion in initial chest CT scan. Dyspnea was the patient's main complaint at the time of admission in this center and the oxygen saturation was 84%. In the new chest CT scan, similar findings were observed. Due to the severe respiratory distress, a chest tube was placed in the chest cavity to remove the pleural effusion fluid on day one. The patient's felt relieved immediately after the procedure; however, the oxygen saturation did not raise above 85% despite the oxygen therapy. The cytology of pleural fluid was negative for malignant cells. On day 2, the lymphopenia and high level of CRP suggested the COVID-19 infection. Therefore, a control chest CT scan was conducted and the test for COVID-19 was performed. The CT report indicated the clear pattern of COVID-19's lung involvement in the absence of pleural effusion. Thus, the treatment for COVID-19 was immediately initiated. On day 4, the test reported positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Currently, it is important to bear in mind the COVID-19 infection in evaluating the patients with respiratory symptoms. This report indicated how misleading the presentation of chest CT scan could be in clinical judgment. Therefore, we recommend ruling out the COVID-19 infection in all the patients with any pattern of lung involvement to avoid missing the potential cases of this vicious infection.","Ahmadinejad, Zahra; Salahshour, Faeze; Dadras, Omid; Rezaei, Hesan; Alinaghi, SyyedAhmad",Infectious disorders.

Aim of this study was to (a) expand previous study periods to examine the long-term course of hospital admission numbers, (b) provide data for in- and outpatient care pathways, and (c) illustrate changes of numbers of cardiovascular procedures. METHODS AND RESULTS: Administrative data of patients with ICD-10-encoded primary diagnoses of cardiovascular diseases (heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease) and in- or outpatient treatment between March, 13th 2020 and September, 10th 2020 were analyzed and compared with 2019 data. Numbers of cardiovascular procedures were calculated using OPS-codes. The cumulative hospital admission deficit (CumAD) was computed as the difference between expected and observed admissions for every week in 2020. In total, 80 hospitals contributed 294 361 patient cases to the database without relevant differences in baseline characteristics between the studied periods. There was a CumAD of -10% to -16% at the end of the study interval in 2020 for all disease groups driven to varying degrees by both reductions of in- and outpatient case numbers. The number of performed interventions was significantly reduced for all examined procedures (catheter ablations: -10%; cardiac electronic device implantations: -7%; percutaneous cardiovascular interventions: -9%; cardiovascular surgery: -15%).

486489,Short Communication: Combining Ethics With Efficiency-Israel Defense Forces Experience in Clinical Trials During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2021,"AIM: To investigate the specific risk factors for novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) transmission among health care workers (HCWs) in a tertiary care university hospital. METHODS: Upper respiratory samples of HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. A case-control study was conducted to explore the possible risk factors that lead to SARS-CoV-2 transmission to HCWs. RESULTS: Of 703 HCWs screened between March 20 and May 20, 2020, 50 (7.1%) were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positivity rates for SARS-CoV-2 among physicians, nurses, cleaning personnel, and the other occupations were 6.3%, 8.0%, 9.1%, and 2.6%, respectively. The infection rate was 8.3% among HCWs who worked in COVID-19 units and 3.4% among those who did not work in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) units (RRâ¯=â¯2.449, confidence interval = 1.062-5.649, P= .027). The presence of a SARS-CoV-2 positive person in the household (P = .016), inappropriate use of personnel protective equipment while caring for patients with COVID-19 infection (P = .003), staying in the same personnel break room as an HCW without a medical mask for more than 15 minutes (P = .000), consuming food within 1 m of an HCW (P = .003), and failure to keep a safe social distance from an HCW (P = .003) were statistically significant risk factors for infection. CONCLUSION: HCWs have a high risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission while providing care to COVID-19 patients. Transmission may also occur in nonmedical areas of the hospital while speaking or eating. Periodic screening of HCWs for SARS-CoV-2 may enable early detection and isolation of infected HCWs.","Çelebi, Güven; Piskin, Nihal; Çelik Bekleviç, Arzum; Altunay, Yurdagül; Salci Keles, Aysegül; Tüz, Mehmet Ali; Altinsoy, Bülent; Haciseyitoglu, Demet",Am J Infect Control,,209

The study explored contemporary healthcare leadership culture and the role of followership from the perspective of early career doctors. It found that the leadership and followership challenges for these doctors in training were associated with issues of social and professional identity, communication, the medical hierarchy, and relationships with senior colleagues (support and trust). These challenges were exacerbated by the busy and turbulent clinical environment in which they worked. To cope with various clinical situations and forms of leadership, doctors in training engage in a range of different followership behaviours and strategies. The study raised implications for medical education and training and suggested that followership should be included as part of formal training in communication and team working skills. The importance of both leadership and followership in the delivery of safe and effective patient care has been brought sharply into focus by the COVID-19 pandemic. This article revisits these challenges in light of the pandemic and its impact on the experiences of doctors in training.","Boardman, Nathan; Munro-Berry, Jack; McKimm, Judy",Br J Hosp Med (Lond),,209

Os estudos sobre os sistemas agroalimentares são importantes ferramentas que permitem conhecer as cadeias produtivas, identificar entraves, formular estratégias e políticas públicas e privadas, visando o desenvolvimento do setor. Dessa forma, este trabalho teve como objetivo caracterizar o sistema agroindustrial do pescado no Brasil, identificar seus principais entraves e analisar a atuação governamental perante tais problemas. Para tal, foram consultados órgãos governamentais, associações, bancos de dados, publicações e pessoas relacionadas ao segmento. O sistema agroindustrial, dividido em pesca, aquicultura, indústria e comércio, foi caracterizado quanto ao volume de produção, valores financeiros e número de estabelecimentos e trabalhadores. Após a identificação de entraves ao desenvolvimento do setor, como o estado de sobrepesca dos principais recursos pesqueiros, os diversos problemas enfrentados pela aquicultura, a baixa qualidade higiênico-sanitária dos produtos comercializados, a escassez de informações setoriais publicadas e o baixo consumo de pescado no Brasil, a atuação dos serviços oficiais foi analisada e discutida. Foram identificados como problemas de gestão governamental a sobreposição de funções dos diversos órgãos administradores, a falta de coordenação entre esses órgãos, a ausência de fiscalização do cumprimento da legislação, a carência de políticas públicas claras, a dificuldade na obtenção de crédito para o investimento, a escassez de informações setoriais publicadas, entre outros.

493384,Co-morbidity and blood group type risk in coronavirus disease 2019 patients: A case & ndash;control study,2021,"The capabilities of natural language models trained on large-scale data have increased immensely over the past few years. Open source libraries such as HuggingFace have made these models easily available and accessible. While prior research has identified biases in large language models, this paper considers biases contained in the most popular versions of these models when applied `out-of-the-box' for downstream tasks. We focus on generative language models as they are well-suited for extracting biases inherited from training data. Specifically, we conduct an in-depth analysis of GPT-2, which is the most downloaded text generation model on HuggingFace, with over half a million downloads in the past month alone. We assess biases related to occupational associations for different protected categories by intersecting gender with religion, sexuality, ethnicity, political affiliation, and continental name origin. Using a template-based data collection pipeline, we collect 396K sentence completions made by GPT-2 and find: (i) The machine-predicted jobs are less diverse and more stereotypical for women than for men, especially for intersections; (ii) Intersectional interactions are highly relevant for occupational associations, which we quantify by fitting 262 logistic models; (iii) For most occupations, GPT-2 reflects the skewed gender and ethnicity distribution found in US Labour Bureau data, and even pulls the societally-skewed distribution towards gender parity in cases where its predictions deviate from real labor market observations. This raises the normative question of what language models _should_ learn - whether they should reflect or correct for existing inequalities.","Kirk, Hannah; Jun, Yennie; Iqbal, Haider; Benussi, Elias; Volpin, Filippo; Dreyer, Frederic A.; Shtedritski, Aleksandar; Asano, Yuki M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04130v2.pdf,209

CASE REPORT We report the case of a 41-year-old man with ADPKD, secondary arterial hypertension, and stage 4 chronic kidney disease who presented with a 2-week history of persistent pain at the base of the right hemithorax and in the right hypochondrium. An ultrasound examination and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed a giant cavernous liver hemangioma. Surgery was intially taken into account (however, twice delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic) but later refused because it would have left the patient with dangerously few liver parenchyma. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of ADPKD associated with cavernous liver hemangioma. Vascular endothelial growth factor could be the pathophysiological link between the 2 conditions. Further research may unravel the molecular biology that underlies this possible association, pointing to new therapeutic avenues for ADPKD.","Ghenu, Iuliana Maria; Constantin, Rodica; Ionescu, Dorin; Dragos, Dorin",Am J Case Rep,,209

Cellphilm method capitalises on these trends by inviting participants to use mobile devices to create short videos about health topics. This paper presents the quilted cellphilm method, which supports the participation of stigmatised populations to engage in research. We present the method with reference to the Celling Sex project, which worked with young women who have transactional sex experience. Four key steps in our unique model are discussed: (a) individual cellphilm-making; (b) participatory analysis; (c) creating a composite video; (d) publicly screening the work. We consider how working individually with participants in the cellphilm-making process built trust. We unpack how offering participants opportunities to engage in either group or one-on-one activities promoted participation in collaborative analysis. We outline how creating a composite video of the cellphilms and organising screenings facilitated knowledge translation and exchange. Overall, the quilted cellphilm method created a supportive community for vulnerable participants to generate products that challenged social stigma. Increased reliance on mobile media, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, makes the quilted cellphilm method an opportune, exciting and accessible approach for participatory public health research.","MacEntee, Katie; Kendrick, Caterina; Flicker, Sarah",Glob Public Health,,209

METHODS: A research team and an international consensus working group, including service users, clinicians, and researchers, worked together in an iterative process by using a modified Delphi consensus technique that included videoconferencing calls, online surveys, and focus groups. The research team conducted systematic literature searches to identify outcomes, outcome measures, and risk adjustment factors. After identifying outcomes important to service users, the consensus working group selected outcome measures, risk adjustment factors, and the final set of outcome measures. International stakeholder groups consisting of >100 professionals and service users reviewed and commented on the final set. RESULTS: The consensus working group identified four outcome domains: symptoms, recovery, functioning, and treatment. The domains encompassed 14 outcomes of importance to service users. The research team identified 131 measures from the literature. The consensus working group selected nine measures in an outcome set that takes approximately 35 minutes to complete. CONCLUSIONS: A set of patient-reported outcome measures for use in routine clinical practice was identified. The set is free to service users, is available in at least two languages, and reflects outcomes important to users.

498155,Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio predicts critical illness patients with 2019 coronavirus disease in the early stage,2020,"Within the current epidemiological context and due to the increased risk of infectivity, this article focuses on the practical activity of ""Sf. Spiridon"" Ophthalmology Clinic in Iasi, during the emergency period (March 16th -May 16th, 2020), the evaluated ocular pathology and the approached strategy from the point of view of medical and surgical vision. Material and methods: As an Emergency Hospital and Tertiary Center of Moldova, Romania ""Sf. Spiridon"" Hospital in Iasi was the only hospital in the region that dealt with all the urgent ophthalmological pathology during COVID-19. The clinic worked due to the established protocol, the patient's circuit was changed, with the buffer zone for the suspicious COVID-19 patient, where the patient was hospitalized until the negative PCR result. All patients having a negative PCR test benefited from both medical and / or surgical treatment depending on the type of ocular pathology. Results: 619 patients were examined in the emergency room, of which 61 patients were hospitalized in Clinic I Ophthalmology, ""Sf. Spiridon"" Hospital in Iasi, between March 16 and May 16, 2020. Most patients (59%) came from the neighboring counties (Suceava, Vaslui, Piatra Neamt, Bacau) the rest being from Iasi (41%). The age varied from 2 to 87 years, the average age being 51.72 +/- 22.16. Most frequently, patients were hospitalized with retinal detachment (29.5%), trauma (24.6%) and corneal sclerosis (13.1%), most cases being surgical. The average length of stay was 6.3 days. The average time of surgery stages was 45 minutes. The condition at discharge was in 60% of cases improved and 30% cured. All patients tested negative for COVID-19 PCR. Visual acuity and IOP showed slightly higher / lower changes at discharge than at the time of admission. Depending on the diagnosis, the average stay for the patients with retinal detachment was about 4 days, while for patients with glaucoma (13 days) or ulcer corneal (12 days), the long-term hospitalization exceeded 12 days. The multivariate analysis showed that about 10% of the number of days spent in hospital (dependent variable) can be explained by the diagnosis of hospitalization and the type of intervention. Correlated with the status of discharge, the number of days spent in hospital did not differ significantly. Conclusions: Most of the ophthalmological activity during the pandemic was surgical, due to the large number of trauma cases from neighboring counties, being the only non-COVID-19 hospital in the North-eastern region of Romania. Complying with the protocol suggested by the American Academy of Ophthalmology for protection in the case of ophthalmic surgery allows standard eye care and safe surgery to maintain a sustainable application.","Bogdanici, C.

In light of the recent data highlighting an association between COVID-19 and diabetes, a detailed analysis aimed at evaluating ACE2 expression pattern distribution in human pancreas is still lacking. Here, we took advantage of INNODIA network EUnPOD biobank collection to thoroughly analyze ACE2, both at mRNA and protein level, in multiple human pancreatic tissues and using several methodologies. Using multiple reagents and antibodies, we showed that ACE2 is expressed in human pancreatic islets, where it is preferentially expressed in subsets of insulin producing ß-cells. ACE2 is also highly expressed in pancreas microvasculature pericytes and moderately expressed in rare scattered ductal cells. By using different ACE2 antibodies we showed that a recently described short-ACE2 isoform is also prevalently expressed in human ß-cells. Finally, using RT-qPCR, RNA-seq and High-Content imaging screening analysis, we demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines, but not palmitate, increase ACE2 expression in the ß-cell line EndoC-ßH1 and in primary human pancreatic islets. Taken together, our data indicate a potential link between SARS-CoV-2 and diabetes through putative infection of pancreatic microvasculature and/or ductal cells and/or through direct ß-cell virus tropism.","Fignani, Daniela; Licata, Giada; Brusco, Noemi; Nigi, Laura; Grieco, Giuseppina E; Marselli, Lorella; Overbergh, Lut; Gysemans, Conny; Colli, Maikel L; Marchetti, Piero; Mathieu, Chantal; Eizirik, Decio L; Sebastiani, Guido; Dotta, Francesco",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,209

In this review, we discuss ways in which usage of the social networking platform Twitter has expanded in the past year during virtual conferences as a method to facilitate-and, in some ways, democratize-information flow and professional networking. RECENT FINDINGS: Emerging Twitter-based tools in malignant hematology include presenter-developed #tweetorials, conference-specific ""poster walks,"" and disease-specific online journal clubs. Twitter is also increasingly being used for networking across institutional and international lines, allowing for conversations to continue year-round as a first step toward multicenter collaborations as well as in-person #tweetups at subsequent meetings.

Greatly, there are limited studies concerned with the effect of airborne pollutants on COVID-19 infection, while exposure to airborne pollutants may harm human health. This paper aimed to examine the associations of acute exposure to ambient atmospheric pollutants to daily newly COVID-19 confirmed cases in 41 Chinese cities. Using a generalized additive model with Poisson distribution controlling for temperature and relative humidity, we evaluated the association between pollutant concentrations and daily COVID-19 confirmation at single-city level and multicity levels. We observed a 10-µg/m3 rise in levels of PM2.5 (lag 0-14), O3 (lag 0-1), SO2 (lag 0), and NO2 (lag 0-14) were positively associated with relative risks of 1.050 (95% CI: 1.028, 1.073), 1.011 (1.007, 1.015), 1.052 (1.022, 1.083), and 1.094 (1.028, 1.164) of daily newly confirmed cases, respectively. Further adjustment for other pollutants did not change the associations materially (excepting in the model for SO2). Our results indicated that COVID-19 incidence may be susceptible to airborne pollutants such as PM2.5, O3, SO2, and NO2, and mitigation strategies of environmental factors are required to prevent spreading.","Lu, Bingqing; Wu, Na; Jiang, Jiakui; Li, Xiang",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

For the purpose of forecasting the inclination of the epidemic and evaluate the effectiveness of public interventions, we focus on constructing models consisting of differential equations and machine learning in this paper. Applying the SIR and SEIR epidemic models and the LSTM RNN model in Beijing, China, we demonstrate the comparison between models implemented public health interventions and without it. The similar accuracy of SEIR-2 (adopted interventions) and the LSTM RNN model to the true value present the necessity to implement public health interventions such as quarantines to postpone the crest point, obtaining a prolonged time to confront the epidemic. The utility of the model is compelling and worthy to apply in other cities. © 2021 Author(s).","Kang, Y.","3rd International Conference on Frontiers of Biological Sciences and Engineering, FBSE 2020",,209

METHODS: All eyes receiving intravitreal injections of any kind from a single large tertiary retina practice in Houston, TX, USA before (August 2017-March 22, 2020) and after (March 23, 2020-Sept 2020) COVID-19 pandemic universal masking protocols. The total number of injections and cases of acute injection-related endophthalmitis were determined from billing records and subsequent retrospective chart review. The primary outcome was the rate of endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection. Secondary outcomes included visual acuity, time until initial presentation, patient age, and differences in overall number of injections performed monthly pre- and post-COVID 19. RESULTS: A total of 134, 097 intravitreal injections were performed during the study period (111,679 pre-COVID-19 and 22,418 post-COVID-19 masking protocols). A total of 41 cases of acute endophthalmitis occurred in the pre-COVID group (0.04%, 1 in 2500) and 7 cases in post COVID group (0.03%, 1 in 3333) p = 0.85. CONCLUSION: In this single center, retrospective study, the implementation of universal patient and physician masking as practiced during the COVID-19 pandemic did not significantly affect the rate of post intravitreal injection endophthalmitis.","Naguib, Mina M; Ghauri, Sophia; Mukhopadhyay, Anirudh; Schefler, Amy C",Retina,,209

519975,Physician Perspectives about Telemedicine: Considering the Usability of Telemedicine in Response to Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"PURPOSE: Symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection have made the assessment and triage of cancer patients extremely complicated. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and implementation of a COVID-19 screening tool for oncology telephone triage. METHODS: An Ambulatory Oncology Clinical Nurse Educator and three faculty members worked on the development of an oncology specific triage tool based on the challenges that oncology nurses were having with the generic COVID triage tool. A thorough search of the published literature, as well as pertinent websites, verified that no screening tool for oncology patients was available. RESULTS: The screening tool met a number of essential criteria: (1) simple and easy to use, (2) included the most common signs and symptoms as knowledge of COVID-19 infection changed, (3) was congruent with the overall screening procedures of the medical center, (4) included questions about risk factors for and environmental exposures related to COVID-19, and (5) assessed patient's current cancer history and treatment status. Over a period of 3 weeks, the content and specific questions on the tool were modified based on information obtained from a variety of sources and feedback from the triage nurses. CONCLUSION: Within 1 month, the tool was developed and implemented in clinical practice. Oncology clinicians can modify this tool to triage patients as well as to screen patients in a variety of outpatient settings (e.g., chemotherapy infusion units, radiation therapy departments). The tool will require updates and modifications based on available resources and individual health care organizations' policies and procedures.","Elkin, Emmika; Viele, Carol; Schumacher, Karen; Boberg, Maureen; Cunningham, Mari; Liu, Lauren; Miaskowski, Christine",Support. care cancer,,209

Given the high prevalence of obesity in the United States, we hypothesized that the presence of obesity may play a role in the clinical course of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of adult patients admitted with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and clinical outcomes were abstracted. BMI (kilograms per meter squared) was analyzed with regard to a composite outcome of intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death and intubation rate. RESULTS: About 770 patients were included (61% male, mean age 63.5 years). Patients with obesity were more likely to present with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Obesity was also associated with a significantly higher rate of ICU admission or death (RR = 1.58, P = 0.002) even after adjusting for age, race, and troponin level. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with obesity had an increased risk for critical illness leading to ICU admission or death compared with normal weight individuals. This study confirms that obesity is a major risk factor for COVID-19 disease severity, significantly impacting disease presentation and critical care requirements.","Hajifathalian, Kaveh; Kumar, Sonal; Newberry, Carolyn; Shah, Shawn; Fortune, Brett; Krisko, Tibor; Ortiz-Pujols, Shiara; Zhou, Xi Kathy; Dannenberg, Andrew J; Kumar, Rekha; Sharaiha, Reem Z",Obesity (Silver Spring),,209

SUBJECTS: All outpatient mental health treatment facilities (N=8860) listed in the Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration on April 16, 2020. MEASURES: Primary outcome is whether an outpatient mental health treatment facility reported offering telehealth services. RESULTS: Approximately 43% of outpatient mental health facilities in the United States reported telehealth availability at the outset of the pandemic. Facilities located in the United States South and nonmetropolitan counties were more likely to offer services, as were facilities with public sector ownership, those providing care for both children and adults, and those accepting Medicaid as a form of payment. Outpatient mental health treatment facilities located in states with state-wide shelter-in-place laws were less likely to offer telehealth, as well as facilities in counties with more COVID-19 cases per 10,000 population. CONCLUSIONS: At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer than half of outpatient mental health treatment facilities were providing telehealth services. Our results suggest that additional policies to promote telehealth may be warranted to increase availability over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cantor, Jonathan H; McBain, Ryan K; Kofner, Aaron; Stein, Bradley D; Yu, Hao",Med. care,,209

Nevertheless, only very recently it was entirely realized that viruses would not succeed without efficient tools to undermine this potent host defense system. Current investigations are revealing an astonishing variety of viral IFN antagonistic strategies targeting virtually all parts of the IFN system, often in a highly specific manner. Viruses were found to interfere with induction of IFN synthesis, IFN-induced signaling events, the antiviral effector proteins, or simply shut off the host cell macromolecule synthesis machinery to avoid booting of the antiviral host defense. Here, we will describe a few well-characterized examples to illustrate the sophisticated and often multi-layered anti-IFN mechanisms employed by viruses.","Weber, Friedemann; Haller, Otto",Biochimie,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030090840700017X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17336442/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030090840700017X,209

We emphasize a critical point of quasispecies that refers to genome collectivities as the unit of selection, and establish parallels between RNA viruses and some cellular systems such as bacteria and tumor cells. We refer also to tantalizing new observations that suggest quasispecies behavior in prions, perhaps as a result of the same quantum-mechanical indeterminations that underlie protein conformation and error-prone replication in genetic systems. If substantiated, these observations with prions could lead to new research on the structure–function relationship of non-nucleic acid biological molecules.","Ojosnegros, Samuel; Perales, Celia; Mas, Antonio; Domingo, Esteban",Virus Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21945638/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.09.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170211003558; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170211003558,209

The original manuscript provides a theoretical and empirical foundation of an instructional design approach—empathic design—where designers, during the design process, predict how learners would feel while engaging in the final design solution. Empathic design has significant implications in the “shift to digital” during the pandemic. That is, when designing the remote learning experience, instructional designers need to project into the remote contexts and predict learners’ engagement experiences in these contexts. To address the “shift to digital” remote learning, empathic design needs to be extended with two important considerations, including learners’ engagement and the context in which engagement occurs. This paper discusses how empathic design can be applied to consider four types of engagement (i.e., behavioral, cognitive, affective, and social engagement) and three contextual features (e.g., physical environment, technological, and social features) in order to best support learner experiences in the “shift to digital” remote learning during the pandemic.","Xie, Kui",Educ Technol Res Dev,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-020-09898-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33223779/,209

No studies yet have been done to examine this phenomenon. OBJECTIVE: This paper examines the interrelated effects of the unprecedented global increase of EMS call, the effect of the COVID-19 crisis on responding to non-COVID-19 emergencies, and the concurrent effects of having overwhelmed dispatch centers. It tries to explain the current evidence of the bottleneck of EMS calls during the early phase of the worldwide pandemic. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We examine the numbers of EMS calls internationally between March and June 2020, derived from published literature and news media. Only articles in English were selected, with certain keywords related to EMS calls, ambulance delay, stroke and cardiac arrest. SOURCE OF EVIDENCE: Google Scholar was the main searching source. RESULTS: After applying the selection criteria, a total of 29 citations were chosen, and a pattern of knowledge resulted in the emergence of five themes: EMS calls during COVID-19, Reduced EMS operator response time, Ambulance response delays, Collateral mortality and morbidity among non-COVID-19 cases, and Total ambulance call time. CONCLUSION: Over the course of COVID-19 progress, there was a global phenomenon of exponential increases in EMS calls, which is expected to impose a great pressure on EMS dispatch centers. Several factors contributing to the bottleneck of EMS calls are identified and explained.","Al Amiry, Alaa; Maguire, Brian J",Open Access Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34522146/; https://doi.org/10.2147/oaem.s324568,209

Computational methods have been applied to the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak in five different countries (Ireland, Germany, UK, South Korea and Iceland) using their reported daily infection data. A Gaussian convolution smoothing function constructed a continuous epidemic line profile that was segmented into longitudinal time series of mathematically fitted individual logistic curves. The time series of fitted curves allowed comparison of disease progression with differences in decreasing daily infection numbers following the epidemic peak being of specific interest. A positive relationship between rate of declining infections and countries with comprehensive COVID-19 testing regimes existed. In contrast, extended epidemic timeframes were recorded for those least prepared for large scale testing and contact tracing. As many countries continue to struggle to implement population wide testing it is prudent to explore additional measures that could be employed. Comparative analysis of healthcare worker (HCW) infection data from Ireland shows it closely related to that of the entire population with respect to trends of daily infection numbers and growth rates over a 57-day period. With 31.6% of all test-confirmed infections in healthcare workers (all employees of healthcare facilities), they represent a concentrated 3% subset of the national population which if exhaustively tested (regardless of symptom status) could provide valuable information on disease progression in the entire population (or set). Mathematically, national population and HCWs can be viewed as a set and subset with significant influences on each other, with solidarity between both an essential ingredient for ending this crisis.","Wu, D.; Mac Aonghusa, P.; O'Shea, D.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.21.20179283v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179283,209

This paper uses a modelling-based scenario analysis to assess the restriction policies relating to air transport in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia during and after the pandemic and their effects on the environment. The simulation results highlight the need to reduce the negative environmental impact produced by the aviation sector and suggest that policymakers should try to focus on creating ways to reduce the impact made by the aviation industry on the environment, through a coordinated environmental policy between countries, including the three that are the subject of the present case study in order to highlight these issues.","Calderon-Tellez, Javier; Herrera, Milton M.",Transp Res Interdiscip Perspect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33754140/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2021.100351; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590198221000580; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198221000580?v=s5,209

When confronted with a global health threat, government across the world, have understood that the rhetoric of individualization, personal responsibility and personal choice would only led to disastrous national health consequences. In other words, individual choice offers a poor criterion to guide the health and wellbeing of a population. This reality has forced many advanced economies around the world to suspend their pledges to ‘small government’, individual responsibility and individual freedom, opting instead for a more rebalanced approach to economic and health outcomes with an increasing role for institutions and mutualization. For many marginalized communities, individualization ideologies and personalization approaches have never worked. On the contrary, they have exacerbated social and health inequalities by benefiting affluent individuals who possess the educational, cultural and economic resources required to exercise ‘responsibility’, avert risks and adopt health protecting behaviours. The individualization of the management of risk has also further stigmatized the poor by shifting the blame for poor health outcomes from government to individuals. This paper will explore how the COVID-19 pandemic exposes the cracks of neoliberal rhetoric on personalization and opens new opportunities to approach the health of a nation as socially, economically and politically determined requiring ‘upstream’ interventions on key areas of health including housing, employment, education and access to health care.","Cardona, Beatriz",Health Promot Int,https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daaa112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33025018/,209

Surgical treatment of non-COVID-19 related disease during this period, however, still remains necessary. The decision to proceed with medically necessary, time-sensitive (MeNTS) procedures in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic requires incorporation of factors (resource limitations, COVID-19 transmission risk to providers and patients) heretofore not overtly considered by surgeons in the already complicated processes of clinical judgment and shared decision-making. We describe a scoring system that systematically integrates these factors to facilitate decision-making and triage for MeNTS procedures, and appropriately weighs individual patient risks with the ethical necessity of optimizing public health concerns. This approach is applicable across a broad range of hospital settings (academic and community, urban and rural) in the midst of the pandemic and may be able to inform case triage as operating room capacity resumes once the acute phase of the pandemic subsides.","Prachand, Vivek N.; Milner, Ross; Angelos, Peter; Posner, Mitchell C.; Fung, John J.; Agrawal, Nishant; Jeevanandam, Valluvan; Matthews, Jeffrey B.",J Am Coll Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32278725/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1072751520303173; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1072751520303173; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.04.011,209

Accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays has emerged as a major barrier to COVID-19 diagnosis, particularly in cases requiring urgent or emergent treatment. Areas covered: In this review, we explore the major reasons for false-positive and false-negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. How clinical characteristics, specific respiratory comorbidities and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination impact on existing diagnostic assays are highlighted. Different COVID-19 management algorithms based on each test and limitations are thoroughly presented. Expert opinion: The diagnostic accuracy and the capacity of every available assay, which need to be interpreted in the light of the background incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the communities in which they are used, are essential in order to minimize the number of falsely tested cases. Automated testing platforms may enhance diagnostic accuracy by minimizing the potential for human error in assays’ performance. Prior immunization against SARS-CoV-2 impairs the utility of serologic testing of suspected COVID-19 cases. Future avenues of research to evaluate lung tissue innate immune responses hold promise as a target for research to optimize SARS-CoV-2 and future infections’ testing accuracy.","Mouliou, Dimitra S.; Gourgoulianis, Konstantinos I.",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33896332/; https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2021.1917389,209

In Africa, K13-propeller genotyping confirms the emergence of the R561H mutation in Rwanda and highlights the continuing dominance of wild-type K13 elsewhere. Using gene editing, we show that R561H, along with C580Y and M579I, confer elevated in vitro ART resistance in some African strains, contrasting with minimal changes in ART susceptibility in others. C580Y and M579I cause substantial fitness costs, which may slow their dissemination in high-transmission settings, in contrast with R561H that in African 3D7 parasites is fitness neutral. In Cambodia, K13 genotyping highlights the increasing spatio-temporal dominance of C580Y. Editing multiple K13 mutations into a panel of Southeast Asian strains reveals that only the R561H variant yields ART resistance comparable to C580Y. In Asian Dd2 parasites C580Y shows no fitness cost, in contrast with most other K13 mutations tested, including R561H. Editing of point mutations in ferredoxin or mdr2, earlier associated with resistance, has no impact on ART susceptibility or parasite fitness. These data underline the complex interplay between K13 mutations, parasite survival, growth and genetic background in contributing to the spread of ART resistance.","Stokes, Barbara H; Dhingra, Satish K; Rubiano, Kelly; Mok, Sachel; Straimer, Judith; Gnädig, Nina F; Deni, Ioanna; Schindler, Kyra A; Bath, Jade R; Ward, Kurt E; Striepen, Josefine; Yeo, Tomas; Ross, Leila S; Legrand, Eric; Ariey, Frédéric; Cunningham, Clark H; Souleymane, Issa M; Gansané, Adama; Nzoumbou-Boko, Romaric; Ndayikunda, Claudette; Kabanywanyi, Abdunoor M; Uwimana, Aline; Smith, Samuel J; Kolley, Olimatou; Ndounga, Mathieu; Warsame, Marian; Leang, Rithea; Nosten, François; Anderson, Timothy JC; Rosenthal, Philip J; Ménard, Didier; Fidock, David A",eLife,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34279219/; https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.66277,209

One such strategy includes utilizing the knowledge gained from the SARS and MERS outbreaks regarding existing antivirals. Indicating a potential for success, one of the drugs, remdesivir, under repurposing studies, has shown positive results in initial clinical studies. Therefore, in the current work, the authors have attempted to utilize the remdesivir–RdRp complex – RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) being the putative target for remdesivir – to screen a library of the already reported RdRp inhibitor database. Further clustering on the basis of structural features and scoring refinement was performed to filter out false positive hits. Finally, molecular dynamics simulation was carried out to validate the identification of hits as RdRp inhibitors against novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV.

Some of these changes may have been beneficial to perinatal outcomes; however, other factors such as reduced access to face-to-face healthcare may have contributed negatively to antenatal care. The aim of this audit was to evaluate neonatal admissions in the South-West of England during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the previous two years 2018–2019. Anonymised birth and neonatal admission rates from January to December 2020 was obtained and compared to data from 2018 to 2019.

To eradicate it, it is crucial to acquire a strong and long-lasting anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity, by either natural infection or vaccination. We collected blood samples 12–305 days after positive polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) from 35 recovered individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2-derived peptide pools, such as the Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N), and Membrane (M) proteins, and we quantified anti-S immunoglobulins in plasma. After 10 months post-infection, we observed a sustained SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T-cell response directed against M-protein, but responses against S- or N-proteins were lost over time. Besides, we demonstrated that A-group individuals presented significantly higher frequencies of specific CD4+ T-cell responses against Pep-M than O-group individuals. The A-group subjects also needed longer to clear the virus and they lost cellular immune responses over time, compared to the O-group individuals, who showed a persistent specific immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the S-specific immune response was lost over time, and individual factors determine the sustainability of the body’s defences, which must be considered in the future design of vaccines to achieve continuous anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Summary This work describes that cellular responses against SARS-CoV-2 M-protein can be detected after 10 months but were lost against S- and N-proteins. Moreover, the individual factors; ABO-group and age influence the sustainability of the specific humoral and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","Gil-Manso, Sergio; Blanco, Iria Miguens; Motyka, Bruce; Halpin, Anne; Lopez-Esteban, Rocio; Perez-Fernandez, Veronica A.; Carbonell, Diego; López-Fernández, Luis Andrés; West, Lori; Correa-Rocha, Rafael; Pion, Marjorie",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.23.445114,209

The SARS-CoV viral genome encodes several proteins which have no homology to proteins in any other coronaviruses, and a number of these proteins have been implicated in viral cytopathies. One such protein is 3a, which is also known as X1, ORF3 and U274. 3a expression is detected in both SARS-CoV infected cultured cells and patients. Among the different functions identified, 3a is a capable of inducing apoptosis. We previously showed that caspase pathways are involved in 3a-induced apoptosis. In this study, we attempted to find out protein domains on 3a that are essential for its pro-apoptotic function. Protein sequence analysis reveals that 3a possesses three major protein signatures, the cysteine-rich, Yxxϕ and diacidic domains. We showed that 3a proteins carrying respective mutations in these protein domains exhibit reduced pro-apoptotic activities, indicating the importance of these domains on 3a's pro-apoptotic function. It was previously reported that 3a possesses potassium ion channel activity. We further demonstrated that the blockade of 3a's potassium channel activity abolished caspase-dependent apoptosis. This report provides the first evidence that ion channel activity of 3a is required for its pro-apoptotic function. As ion channel activity has been reported to regulate apoptosis in different pathologic conditions, finding ways to modulate the ion channel activity may offer a new direction toward the inhibition of apoptosis triggered by SARS-CoV.","Chan, Chak-Ming; Tsoi, Ho; Chan, Wing-Man; Zhai, Shenyu; Wong, Ching-On; Yao, Xiaoqiang; Chan, Wood-Yee; Tsui, Stephen Kwok-Wing; Chan, Ho Yin Edwin",Int J Biochem Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19398035/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2009.04.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357272509001538; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1357272509001538,209

Gingivitis data are then broken into parts by the demultiplexer followed by individual proposed header generation. It is predominantly done to confuse the intruders about the originality of the intraoral data. Chi-square, Avalanche, Strict Avalanche, etc. were carried on the proposed partial shares to generate good outcomes when compared to classical algorithms. To confuse the intruders, character frequency, floating frequency, and autocorrelation were tested extensively. It is a newer approach to avail the secured Teledental features in post-COVID time.","Dey, Joydeep; Sarkar, Arindam; Karforma, Sunil",Int J Inf Technol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33426424/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41870-020-00562-1,209
607387,The First Consecutive 5000 Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 from Qatar; a Nation-wide Cohort Study,2020-07-16,"Summary WHO has listed several priority diseases with epidemic potential for which there are no, or insufficient, medical countermeasures. In response, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (with support from PricewaterhouseCoopers) coordinated subject matter experts to create a preparedness plan for Disease X. Disease X is caused by Pathogen X, an infectious agent that is not currently known to cause human disease, but an aetiologic agent of a future outbreak with epidemic or pandemic potential. We have identified crucial areas for acceleration in medical countermeasure product development and international coordination. We have also reviewed novel platforms and process improvements related to manufacturing, which could revolutionise the response to the next pandemic. Finally, we created several coordination and engagement guides. These guides range from the rational design of an intervention target product profile, to the key facets of vaccine and therapeutic development, to accelerated manufacturing and regulatory mechanisms. In this Personal View, we provide a high-level summary of the outcomes of the medical countermeasure development workstream, intended for a broad audience including academia, medical countermeasure developers, and multilateral coordinating bodies. We hope that they might find this piece useful in prioritising strategic investments and efforts to accelerate medical countermeasure development. We observed that in-depth analyses of clinical trial design, chemistry, manufacturing and control activities, and accelerated regulatory pathways are necessary for shortening the timelines for the product development of medical countermeasures. We intend to cover these topics in future publications.","Simpson, Shmona; Kaufmann, Michael C; Glozman, Vitaly; Chakrabarti, Ajoy",Lancet Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309920301237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32197097/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30123-7; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309920301237,209
607551,Coronavirus Disease 2019: the Pivotal Role of UK Clinical Oncology and the UK Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project,2020-06-05,"BACKGROUND: In August 2020, Sputnik V was registered as Gam-COVID-Vac by the Russian Ministry of Health, and since December 2020 it has been distributed in 61 countries worldwide. On 25 February 2021, the Republic of San Marino started its vaccination campaign, which includes Sputnik V. Our aim was to describe the adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) with this vaccine through participant-based active surveillance in the country. METHODS: Beginning from 4 March to 8 April 2021, a nationwide study was conducted on San Marino's population aged 18–89 years who received one or two doses of Sputnik V. E-questionnaire dissemination occurred through e-mails, QR-codes or live/phone interviews ~7 days after the first and second vaccine dose. A descriptive analysis was conducted to quantify AEFI incidence on both occasions, stratifying results by type and severity of symptoms. FINDINGS: Mean age of the 2558 vaccine recipients was 66±14 years. First-dose AEFI incidence was 53.3% (systemic reactions at 42.2%), while second-dose AEFI incidence was 66.8% (systemic reactions at 50.4%) (n = 1288). In general, 76.0% of two-dose recipients reported some AEFIs after either vaccine dose, and 2.1% suffered severe reactions; in 60- to 89-year-olds (n = 1021), AEFI incidence was 70.0%, with 53.0% of subjects describing systemic reactions and 0.8% reporting severe symptoms. The most frequent symptoms were local pain, asthenia, headache and joint pain. INTERPRETATION: Our results, albeit preliminary, suggest that Sputnik V has a high tolerability profile in the population aged ≥60 years in terms of short-term AEFIs.

Still, the interprofessional collaboration between physicians and pharmacists in their everyday work seems rare. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the types of contact between them, possible mutual collaboration, and barriers to implementation. This study was conducted from April to August 2020. The study group included licensed pharmacists working in community pharmacies in Poland (n = 207). The results show that, according to the respondents, physician–pharmacist contact mainly concerns formal aspects, such as correcting prescription errors. They occasionally communicate for other matters, such as consultation regarding drug availability and drug dosage. However, when asked to divide responsibilities between them and physicians, pharmacists indicate areas that should involve interprofessional collaboration, e.g., monitoring adverse drug reactions, analysis of multi-drug therapy, and checking the regularity of taking medications. They indicated the lack of specific collaboration rules, limited willingness to establish relationships and low mutual respect and trust among existing barriers. It is worth considering the possibility of overcoming these barriers provided by interprofessional education in order to develop communication skills and build relationships based on respect.","Zielińska-Tomczak, Łucja; Cerbin-Koczorowska, Magdalena; Przymuszała, Piotr; Gałązka, Natalia; Marciniak, Ryszard",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574606/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189686,209

The current study investigates the prevalence rate of MSP and disability among professional bus drivers. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 83 professional bus drivers. The prevalence rate of MSP was evaluated using a standardized Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire. The disabilities due to the MSP were evaluated using neck disability index (NDI), Oswestry disability index (ODI) and shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI) tools. Prevalence of MSP was presented with 95% of confidence interval (CI) at an alpha level of 0.05. The 12 months and 7 days prevalence of MSP were tabulated for analysing the trend of MSP between the upper and lower body regions. RESULTS: The drivers had a mean driving experience of 10.07 ± 7.26 years. The mean driving hours/week were 50.25 ± 12.82 h. Neck and back were the most affected regions with a prevalence rate of 81.9% (N = 68) and 80.7% (N = 67) at 12 months. Back region recorded the highest 7 days prevalence rate for MSP with 53% (N = 44). Approximately one fourth of the bus drivers population (23.9%, N = 16) had moderate disability in back region. More than half with MSP in the neck region presented mild disability (54.4%, N = 37). CONCLUSION: The bus drivers reported a high prevalence rate of MSP in the neck, back and shoulder regions with mild to moderate disabilities. Appropriate health care and rehabilitation programs are necessary for the prevention and management of MSP among the bus drivers.","Kasemsan, Apirati; Joseph, Leonard; Paungmali, Aatit; Sitilertpisan, Patraporn; Pirunsan, Ubon",Int Arch Occup Environ Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33856539/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-021-01683-1,209
608433,Comorbidity indices in people with HIV and considerations for coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND: Thailand is among the top five countries with effective COVID-19 transmission control. This study examines how news of presence of COVID-19 in Thailand, as well as varying levels of government restriction on movement, affected human mobility in a rural Thai population along the border with Myanmar. METHODS: This study makes use of mobility data collected using a smartphone app. Between November 2019 and June 2020, four major events concerning information dissemination or government intervention give rise to five time intervals of analysis. Radius of gyration is used to analyze movement in each interval, and movement during government-imposed curfew. Human mobility network visualization is used to identify changes in travel patterns between main geographic locations of activity. Cross-border mobility analysis highlights potential for intervillage and intercountry disease transmission. RESULTS: Inter-village and cross-border movement was common in the pre-COVID-19 period. Radius of gyration and cross-border trips decreased following news of the first imported cases. During the government lockdown period, radius of gyration was reduced by more than 90% and cross-border movement was mostly limited to short-distance trips. Human mobility was nearly back to normal after relaxation of the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into the impact of the government lockdown policy on an area with extremely low socio-economic status, poor healthcare resources, and highly active cross-border movement. The lockdown had a great impact on reducing individual mobility, including cross-border movement. The quick return to normal mobility after relaxation of the lockdown implies that close monitoring of disease should be continued to prevent a second wave.","Haddawy, Peter; Lawpoolsri, Saranath; Sa-ngamuang, Chaitawat; Su Yin, Myat; Barkowsky, Thomas; Wiratsudakul, Anuwat; Kaewkungwal, Jaranit; Khamsiriwatchara, Amnat; Sa-angchai, Patiwat; Sattabongkot, Jetsumon; Cui, Liwang",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245842; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33534857/,209

Several of these antiseptics have demonstrated the ability to cut the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 by 3–4 log(10) in 15–30 s in vitro. In addition, hypertonic saline targets viral replication by increasing hypochlorous acid inside the cell. A number of clinical trials are in process to study these interventions both for prevention of transmission, prophylaxis after exposure, and to diminish progression by reduction of viral load in the early stages of infection.","Stathis, Christopher; Victoria, Nikolas; Loomis, Kristin; Nguyen, Shaun A; Eggers, Maren; Septimus, Edward; Safdar, Nasia",Future Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33464122/; https://doi.org/10.2217/fmb-2020-0286,209

However, it is unclear which CS patients would most benefit from long term ICM monitoring. This study aims to determine the risk factors in patients that would confer maximum benefit from ICM placement following CS. METHODS: A Columbia University Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved retrospective analysis of medical records of 125 patients with CS followed by implantation of ICM was evaluated. Univariable and multivariable time-to-event analyses were performed on demographics, hours of activity and variability (HRV), stroke location, thrombosis etiology, and CHA(2)DS(2) − VASc score. The primary outcome was presence of ICM-detected AF defined as AF lasting at least 2 min. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five patients (mean 67.6 years ± 2.4 years, 60% male) were followed for at least 3 months. Twenty-two patients (18%) were found to have clinically verified detected AF; median of time to detection was 95 days. Upon univariable demographic analysis followed by multivariable Cox regression analysis, individuals with age 75 or older (HR: 3.987, p = 0.0046) or LVEF 40% and lower (HR: 3.056, p = 0.0213) had significantly higher risk of AF. Diabetics also had a lower AF detection in multivariable analysis (HR: 0.128, p = 0.0466). CONCLUSIONS: Age 75 or older and LVEF ≤40% were the factors on multivariable analysis that predicted AF detection. Diabetes is a possible significant factor which should be evaluated further. CHA(2)DS(2) − VASc score was notably not predictive of AF detected on ICM.

Following an extensive literature search, we identified 24 eligible studies, including a total of 624 pediatric cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, which report data on 27 different biomarkers. We then performed a meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence estimates (PPE) for these laboratory abnormalities in mild COVID-19. As data was too limited for children with severe COVID-19 to allow pooling, results were presented descriptively in a summary of findings table. Our data show an inconsistent pattern of change in the leukocyte index of mild and severe cases of COVID-19 in children. Specifically, changes in leukocyte counts were only observed in 32% of the mild pediatric cases (PPE: 13% increase, 19% decrease). In mild disease, creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) was frequently elevated, with a PPE of 33%. In severe disease, c-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were frequently elevated. Based on data obtained from early COVID-19 studies, leukocyte indices in children appear inconsistent, differing from those reported in adults that highlight specific leukocyte trends. This brings into question the utility and reliability of such parameters in monitoring disease severity in the pediatric population. Instead, we suggest physicians to serially monitor CRP, PCT, and LDH to track the course of illness in hospitalized children. Finally, elevated CK-MB in mild pediatric COVID-19 cases is indicative of possible cardiac injury. This highlights the importance of monitoring cardiac biomarkers in hospitalized patients and the need for further investigation of markers such as cardiac troponin in future studies.","Michael Henry, Brandon; Benoit, Stefanie W.; Helena Santos de Oliveira, Maria; Chin Hsieh, Wan; Benoit, Justin; Ballout, Rami A.; Plebani, Mario; Lippi, Giuseppe",Clin Biochem,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2020.05.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32473151/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009912020303313; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009912020303313?v=s5,209
612301,Airborne Spread of Coronavirus Disease-2019 and Its Implications for Nuclear Medicine Practice,2020-10-21,"Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at the end of 2019, the clinical presentation of the disease showed a great heterogeneity with a diverse impact among different subpopulations. Emerging evidence from different parts of the world showed that male patients usually had a longer disease course as well as worse outcome compared to female patients. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind this difference might be a fundamental step for more effective and personalized response to this disease outbreak. For that reason, here we investigate the molecular basis of gender variations in mortality rates related to COVID-19 infection. To achieve this, we used publicly available lung transcriptomic data from 141 females and compare it to 286 male lung tissues. After excluding Y specific genes, our results showed a shortlist of 73 genes that are differentially expressed between the two groups. Further analysis using pathway enrichment analysis revealed downregulation of a group of genes that are involved in the regulation of hydrolase activity including (CHM, DDX3X, FGFR3, SFRP2, and NLRP2) in males lungs compared to females. This pathway is believed to be essential for immune response and antimicrobial activity in the lung tissues. In contrast, our results showed an increased upregulation of angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1), a member of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that plays a role in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activity modulation in male lungs compared to females. Finally, our results showed a differential expression of genes involved in the immune response including the NLRP2 and PTGDR2 in lung tissues of both genders, further supporting the notion of the sex-based immunological differences. Taken together, our results provide an initial evidence of the molecular mechanisms that might be involved in the differential outcomes observed in both genders during the COVID-19 outbreak. This maybe essential for the discovery of new targets and more precise therapeutic options to treat COVID-19 patients from different clinical and epidemiological characteristics with the aim of improving their outcome.","Hachim, Ibrahim Y.; Hachim, Mahmood Y.; Talaat, Iman Mamdouh; López-Ozuna, Vanessa M.; Saheb Sharif-Askari, Narjes; Al Heialy, Saba; Halwani, Rabih; Hamid, Qutayba",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34604307/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2021.728409,209

However, there is a lack of COVID-19 adjusted case fatality risk (aCFR) estimates and information on states with high aCFR. Data on COVID-19 cases and deaths in the first pandemic wave and 17 state-specific geodemographic, socio-economic, health and comorbidity-related factors were collected. State-specific aCFRs were estimated, using a 13-day lag for fatality. To estimate country-level aCFR in the first wave, state estimates were meta-analysed based on inverse-variance weighting and aCFR as either a fixed- or random-effect. Multiple correspondence analyses, followed by univariable logistic regression, were conducted to understand the association between aCFR and geodemographic, health and social indicators. Based on health indicators, states likely to report a higher aCFR were identified. Using random- and fixed-effects models, cumulative aCFRs in the first pandemic wave on 27 July 2020 in India were 1.42% (95% CI 1.19%–1.70%) and 2.97% (95% CI 2.94%–3.00%), respectively. At the end of the first wave, as of 15 February 2021, a cumulative aCFR of 1.18% (95% CI 0.99%–1.41%) using random and 1.64% (95% CI 1.64%–1.65%) using fixed-effects models was estimated. Based on high heterogeneity among states, we inferred that the random-effects model likely provided more accurate estimates of the aCFR for India. The aCFR was grouped with the incidence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and acute respiratory infections in the first and second dimensions of multiple correspondence analyses. Univariable logistic regression confirmed associations between the aCFR and the proportion of urban population, and between aCFR and the number of persons diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and stroke per 10,000 population that had visited NCD (Non-communicable disease) clinics. Incidence of pneumonia was also associated with COVID-19 aCFR. Based on predictor variables, we categorised 10, 17 and one Indian state(s) expected to have a high, medium and low aCFR risk, respectively. The current study demonstrated the value of using meta-analysis to estimate aCFR.

Most studies focus on the globally important nodes in a network, but neglect the locally important nodes in different communities. We claim that given the temporal community feature of opportunistic social networks (OSN), this strategy has a biased understanding of the epidemic dynamics, leading us to conjecture that it is not “the more central, the better” for the implementation of control strategy. In this paper, we track the evolution of community structure and study the effect of community-based immunization strategy on epidemic spreading. We first break the OSN traces down into different communities, and find that the community structure helps to delay the outbreak of epidemic. We then evaluate the local importance of nodes in communities, and show that immunizing nodes with high local importance can remarkably suppress the epidemic. More interestingly, we find that high local importance but non-central nodes play a big role in epidemic spreading process, removing them improves the immunization efficiency by 25% to 150% at different scenarios.","Yuan, Peiyan; Tang, Shaojie",Physica A,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2014.10.087; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037843711400942X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037843711400942X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288091/,209

Many children experience first infections early in life and this impacts their growth and development; however praziquantel (PZQ), the drug used worldwide for the treatment of schistosomiasis, only has regulatory approval among adults and children over the age of four, although it is frequently used “off label” in endemic settings. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) evidence suggests the standard PZQ dose of 40 mg/kg is insufficient in preschool-aged children (PSAC).

Six hundred children, 300 in each setting, aged 12–47 months with Schistosoma infection will be randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive either (1) 40 mg/kg PZQ at baseline and placebo at 6 months, (2) 40 mg/kg PZQ at baseline and 40 mg/kg PZQ at 6 months, (3) 80 mg/kg PZQ at baseline and placebo at 6 months, or (4) 80 mg/kg PZQ at baseline and 80 mg/kg PZQ at 6 months. Following baseline treatment, children will be followed up for 12 months. The co-primary outcomes will be cure rate and egg reduction rate at 4 weeks. Secondary outcomes include drug efficacy assessed by novel antigenic endpoints at 4 weeks, actively collected adverse events and toxicity for 12 h post-treatment, morbidity and nutritional outcomes at 6 and 12 months, biomarkers of inflammation and environmental enteropathy and PZQ PK/PD parameters. DISCUSSION: The trial will provide valuable information on the safety and efficacy of the 80 mg/kg PZQ dose in PSAC, and on the impact of six-monthly versus annual treatment, in this vulnerable age group.

The parental clone 3D4 exhibited a relatively rapid doubling time (25.5 h), high plating efficiency and mixed phenotype with respect to growth on a solid support. Single cell cloning of the 3D4 parent resulted in establishment of several cell lines; three of them designated 3D4/2, 3D4/21 and 3D4/31 were selected for further characterization. All three clones supported the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), swine poxvirus, African swine fever virus (ASFV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), parainfluenza virus, bovine adenovirus (BAV), vaccinia virus (VV), and porcine adenovirus (PAV). Under the conditions tested the cells did not support replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The swine myeloid character was confirmed for all three clones by fluorescence activated cell scanning (FACS) analysis using monoclonal antibodies 74-22-15 and DH59B, which recognize the pan-myeloid antigen cluster SWC3a. A subpopulation of each cell line was positive for nonspecific esterase activity and phagocytic activity to varying degrees depending on the media formulation. Cells from all three lines exhibited anchorage dependent growth when maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5–15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and nonessential amino acids. Propagation in commercially formulated serum free media resulted in colony formation and growth in suspension. The addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to serum free media restored cell attachment. DMSO was also able to induce expression of CD14 monocyte marker in the 3D4/31 cell line maintained in FBS containing medium, as determined by FACS with monoclonal antibody CAM36A. Supplementation of RPMI medium with 10% porcine serum upregulated the expression of CD14 and induced expression of porcine macrophage markers recognized by antibodies 2B10 and 2G6 (Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 74 (2000) 163) in all three cell lines.

619604,Infection Prevention Strategy in Operating Room during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak,2020-06-30,"OBJECTIVE: : The main objective of this survey was to identify how independent midwives, mainly working in primary care, adapted their practices at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in France. Our assumption was that this practice adaptation would vary according to both geographical area (timing of pandemic effect) and whether they practiced alone or in a group. DESIGN: We conducted an online national survey of independent midwives in France from March 16–23, 2020. SETTING: All districts in mainland France and the overseas territories. PARTICIPANTS: Respondents from the population of all independent midwives working in France. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: The primary outcome measure was the proportion of midwives reporting that they had adapted their practices to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the rank, in order of frequency, of the postponed or cancelled activities. RESULTS: : Of the 1517 midwives who responded, i.e., 20.3% of the independent midwives in France, 90.6% reported adapting one or more of their practices . The main adjustment was the postponement or cancellation of consultations deemed non-essential, listed in descending order: postpartum pelvic floor rehabilitation (n=1270, 83.7%), birth preparation (n=1188, 78.3%), non-emergency preventive gynaecology consultation (n=976, 64.3%), early prenatal interview (n=170, 11.2%), and postnatal follow-up (n=158, 10.4%). KEY CONCLUSIONS: Without guidelines, each midwife had to decide individually if and how to adapt her practice. Postpartum pelvic floor rehabilitation and birth preparation have been strongly affected. The results of this national survey indicate that a large majority of midwives have adapted their practices, independently of the local course of the pandemic, and that this reduction of contacts with women raises questions in this period of anxiety about intermediate-term adaptations to guarantee the continuity and safety of care. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study's results can be used to develop tools to handle cancelled consultations. Video, also called virtual, visits and coordination between independent practitioners and hospitals are probably the major challenges in the current context.","Baumann, Sophie; Gaucher, Laurent; Bourgueil, Yann; Saint-Lary, Olivier; Gautier, Sylvain; Rousseau, Anne",Midwifery,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0266613820302904?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33418511/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2020.102918; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0266613820302904,209

Methods Between April 15th and July 15th, 2020, all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and oxygen requirements were prospectively included in a database. Patients who died or required intubation within the first 48 hours were excluded. Patients who received corticoids within the first 5 days of hospitalization and at least 24 hours prior to intubation were considered as in “early corticosteroids group.” To compare both populations and adjust for non-random treatment assignment bias a weight adjusted propensity score model was used. Results 571 patients met the inclusion criteria, 520 had sufficient information for the analysis. Of these, 233 received early corticosteroids and 287 did not. After the analysis, a reduction of 8.5% (p = 0.038) in 30 -day mortality was observed in the early corticosteroid group. The reduction in mortality was nonsignificant when patients with corticosteroid initiation between day 5 and day 8 of hospitalization were included. Conclusion Early corticosteroid use in patients with pneumonia due to COVID-19 and supplementary oxygen requirements without invasive mechanical ventilation reduces mortality.","Moreno, A.; Vargas, C.; Azocar, F.; Villarroel, F.; Cofré, M.; Oppliger, H.; Ríos, F.; Raijmakers, M.; Silva, I.; Beltrán, C.; Zamora, F.",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.09.038; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221007451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34547488/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221007451?v=s5,209

Antiserum raised against this protein reacted specifically with BCV-infected fixed cells in indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and precipitated an in vitro synthesized product approximately 32-kDa in molecular weight and an equivalent protein from BCV-infected cells. The synthesis of ns2 was found to be similar to the structural proteins of BCV and pulse-chase experiments indicated that ns2 protein was stable and that it accumulated in BCV-infected cells. Synthesis of ns2 in the presence of [31P] orthophosphate revealed that it is a phosphoprotein. Phosphoamino acid analysis confirmed the phosphorylated nature of ns2 and identified serine and threonine as its phosphorylated amino acid residues.

Attendance at the Medicare Benefits Scheme (MBS) supported indigenous health checks are crucial to improve prevention and management of chronic health conditions. However, in conjunction with lifestyle and environmental factors, attendance rates at primary healthcare services for screening and treatment have fallen in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to explore the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on preventive health behaviours of indigenous Australians and the associated barriers to, and enablers of, engagement with health services to formulate a targeted intervention strategy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A concurrent mixed-methods study (comprising quantitative and qualitative data collection methods) will be employed. Descriptive analysis of MBS data about the characteristics of indigenous peoples of Australia claiming health assessment services will be performed. Generalised estimating equation regression models will be used to examine the use of health assessment services over time. Qualitative interviews informed by indigenous research methods will be conducted. Interviews will investigate barriers to, and enablers of, engagement with health services. Thematic approach guided by the principles of indigenist praxis, storytelling and collaborative research will be used to analyse the interview data. The project commenced in July 2020 and will be completed by July 2022.

METHODS: CTSA members volunteered to conduct a review on the impact of CTSA network on COVID-19 pandemic with the assistance from NIH survey team in October 2020. The survey questions included the involvement of CTSAs in decision-making concerning the prioritization of COVID-19 studies. Descriptive and statistical analyses were conducted to analyze the survey data. RESULTS: 60 of the 64 CTSAs completed the survey. Most CTSAs lacked preparedness but promptly responded to the pandemic. Early disruption of research triggered, enhanced CTSA engagement, creation of dedicated research areas and triage for prioritization of COVID-19 studies. CTSAs involvement in decision-making were 16.75 times more likely to create dedicated diagnostic laboratories (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.17–129.39; P < 0.01). Likewise, institutions with internal funding were 3.88 times more likely to establish COVID-19 dedicated research (95% CI = 1.12–13.40; P < 0.05). CTSAs were instrumental in securing funds and facilitating establishment of laboratory/clinical spaces for COVID-19 research. Workflow was modified to support contracting and IRB review at most institutions with CTSAs. To mitigate chaos generated by competing clinical trials, central feasibility committees were often formed for orderly review/prioritization. CONCLUSIONS: The lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic emphasize the pivotal role of CTSAs in prioritizing studies and establishing the necessary research infrastructure, and the importance of prompt and flexible research leadership with decision-making capacity to manage future pandemics.","Jayaweera, Dushyantha; Flume, Patrick A.; Singer, Nora G.; Cohen, Myron S.; Lachiewicz, Anne M.; Cameron, Amanda; Kumar, Naresh; Thompson, Joel; Cabrera, Alyssa; Daudelin, Denise; Shaker, Reza; Bauer, Philippe R",Journal of clinical and translational science,https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2021.784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192060/,209
621410,Serial antibody response among hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 cases in India,2020-11-26,"BACKGROUND: Patients with suspected Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection should be hospitalized in isolation wards to avoid transmission. This suspicion can also lead to medical confusion and inappropriate management of acute respiratory syndrome due to causes other than MERS-CoV. METHODS: We studied the characteristics and outcome of patients hospitalized for suspected MERS-CoV infection in the isolation wards of two referral infectious disease departments in the Paris area between January 2013 and December 2016. RESULTS: Of 93 adult patients (49 male (52.6%), median age 63.4 years) hospitalized, 82 out of 93 adult patients had returned from Saudi Arabia, and 74 of them were pilgrims (Hajj). Chest X-ray findings were abnormal in 72 (77%) patients. The 93 patients were negative for MERS-CoV RT-PCR, and 70 (75.2%) patients had documented infection, 47 (50.5%) viral, 22 (23.6%) bacterial and one Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Microbiological analysis identified Rhinovirus (27.9%), Influenza virus (26.8%), Legionella pneumophila (7.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (7.5%), and non-MERS-coronavirus (6.4%). Antibiotics were initiated in 81 (87%) cases, with two antibiotics in 63 patients (67.7%). The median duration of hospitalization and isolation was 3 days (1–33) and 24 h (8–92), respectively. Time of isolation decreased over time (P < 0.01). Two patients (2%) died. CONCLUSION: The management of patients with possible MERS-CoV infection requires medical facilities with trained personnel, and rapid access to virological results. Empirical treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors and an association of antibiotics effective against S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila are the cornerstones of the management of patients hospitalized for suspected MERS-CoV infection.

However, developing novel virus-specific vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 can be time-consuming and costly. Convalescent sera and safe-in-man broad-spectrum antivirals (BSAAs) are readily available treatment options. Here, we developed a neutralization assay using SARS-CoV-2 strain and Vero-E6 cells. We identified the most potent sera from recovered patients for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. We also screened 136 safe-in-man broad-spectrum antivirals against the SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero-E6 cells and identified nelfinavir, salinomycin, amodiaquine, obatoclax, emetine and homoharringtonine.

This virus is known to cause severe bilateral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which can lead to difficulty breathing requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit management. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 77-year-old female with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented as a transfer to our hospital facility with worsening fevers, cough, and respiratory distress. DIAGNOSIS: Chest X-rays revealed bilateral infiltrates worse at the lung bases and CT scan of the chest showed bilateral ground-glass opacities consistent with COVID-19. While our testing revealed a negative COVID-19 result at our institution, the result at a previous hospital returned a positive result. INTERVENTIONS: She was being treated aggressively in the intensive care unit with high dose intravenous ascorbic acid, hydroxychloroquine, and anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody. She also received a loading dose of remdesivir however was unable to complete the course due to organ failure and requirement of vasopressors for hemodynamic stability. OUTCOMES: She remained critically ill and was eventually placed on comfort care as per the family's wishes and passed away. LESSONS: With a rapidly growing death rate and more than 200,000 confirmed cases worldwide, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic and major hit to our healthcare systems. While several companies have already begun vaccine trials and healthcare facilities have been using a wide-range of medications to treat the virus and symptoms, there is not yet an approved medication regimen for COVID-19 infections. The alarming increase in cases per day adds additional pressure to find a cure and decrease the global health burden and mortality rate.","Douedi, Steven; Miskoff, Jeffrey",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32384516/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020207,209

We found that standard vaccine preparations of recombinant Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara produce only about 20–30% plaque-forming virions in fully permissive cell cultures. To evaluate the biological activity of the non-plaque-forming particles, we generated recombinant viruses expressing fluorescent reporter proteins under transcriptional control of specific viral early and late promoters. Live cell imaging and automated counting by fluorescent microscopy indicated that virtually all virus particles can enter cells and switch on viral gene expression. Although most of the non-plaque-forming infections are arrested at the level of viral early gene expression, we detected activation of late viral transcription in 10–20% of single infected cells. Thus, non-plaque-forming particles are biologically active, and likely contribute to the immunogenicity of vaccinia virus vaccines.","Lülf, Anna-Theresa; Freudenstein, Astrid; Marr, Lisa; Sutter, Gerd; Volz, Asisa",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27741426/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682216302586; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682216302586; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2016.09.006,209

The study aimed to analyze the clinical trial characteristics and vaccine development progress of the new Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) registered with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). A comprehensive search of COVID-19 clinical trials since the establishment of the ICTRP to June 11, 2020, was conducted to record and analyze relevant characteristics. Chi-Squared test was used to compare the statistical differences between different research types, interventions, and sources. A total of 3282 COVID-19 clinical trials in 17 clinical trial registration centers were registered with the WHO ICTRP. The main research sources for the present study were ClinicalTrials.gov and ChiCTR. There were significant differences in the parameters of study location (P = .000), number of participants (P = .000), study duration (P = .001), research stage (P = .000), randomization procedure (P = .000), and blinding method (P = .000) between the 2 registration sources. There were significant differences in all the parameters between different kinds of intervention methods. Hydroxychloroquine, plasma therapy, and Xiyanping injection were the high-frequency research drugs used. Ten different vaccine studies were registered under phases I-II. Amongst the studies researched, heterogeneity existed for various parameters. Differences in the type of study, interventions, and registration sources of the studies led to significant differences in certain parameters of the COVID-19 clinical trials. The statistics of high-frequency drugs and the progress of vaccine trials may provide an informative reference for the prevention and control of COVID-19.","Song, Gao; Cheng, Meng Qun; Wei, Xian Wen",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33120812/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000022840,209
628872,Experience With Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: Implications for QT Interval Monitoring,2020-05-28,"Stringent quarantine measures during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown period (January 23, 2020 to March 15, 2020) have resulted in a distinct decrease in anthropogenic source emissions in North China Plain compared to the paralleled period of 2019. Particularly, 22.7% decrease in NO(2) and 3.0% increase of O(3) was observed in Tianjin, nonlinear relationship between O(3) generation and NO(2) implied that synergetic control of NO(x) and VOCs is needed. Deteriorating meteorological condition during the COVID-19 lockdown obscured the actual PM(2.5) reduction. Fireworks transport in 2020 Spring Festival (SF) triggered regional haze pollution. PM(2.5) during the COVID-19 lockdown only reduced by 5.6% in Tianjin. Here we used the dispersion coefficient to normalize the measured PM(2.5) (DN-PM(2.5)), aiming to eliminate the adverse meteorological impact and roughly estimate the actual PM(2.5) reduction, which reduced by 17.7% during the COVID-19 lockdown. In terms of PM(2.5) chemical composition, significant NO(3)(−) increase was observed during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, as a tracer of atmospheric oxidation capacity, odd oxygen (O(x) = NO(2) + O(3)) was observed to reduce during the COVID-19 lockdown, whereas relative humidity (RH), specific humidity and aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) were observed with noticeable enhancement. Nitrogen oxidation rate (NOR) was observed to increase at higher specific humidity and ALWC, especially in the haze episode occurred during 2020SF, high air humidity and obvious nitrate generation was observed. Anomalously enhanced air humidity may response for the nitrate increase during the COVID-19 lockdown period.","Ding, Jing; Dai, Qili; Li, Yafei; Han, Suqin; Zhang, Yufen; Feng, Yinchang",J Environ Sci (China),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34607673/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2021.02.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S100107422100067X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S100107422100067X,209
628895,Does the CCR5-Δ32 mutation explain the variable coronavirus-2019 pandemic statistics in Europe?,2020-12-11,"A major bottleneck in scaling-up COVID-19 testing is the need for sophisticated instruments and well-trained healthcare professionals, which are already overwhelmed due to the pandemic. Moreover, the high-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics are contingent on an RNA extraction step, which, in turn, is restricted by constraints in the supply chain. Here, we present CASSPIT (Cas13 Assisted Saliva-based & Smartphone Integrated Testing), which will allow direct use of saliva samples without the need for an extra RNA extraction step for SARS-CoV-2 detection. CASSPIT utilizes CRISPR-Cas13a based SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, and lateral-flow assay (LFA) readout of the test results. The sample preparation workflow includes an optimized chemical treatment and heat inactivation method, which, when applied to COVID-19 clinical samples, showed a 97% positive agreement with the RNA extraction method. With CASSPIT, LFA based visual limit of detection (LoD) for a given SARS-CoV-2 RNA spiked into the saliva samples was ~200 copies; image analysis-based quantification further improved the analytical sensitivity to ~100 copies. Upon validation of clinical sensitivity on RNA extraction-free saliva samples (n = 76), a 98% agreement between the lateral-flow readout and RT-qPCR data was found (Ct<35). To enable user-friendly test results with provision for data storage and online consultation, we subsequently integrated lateral-flow strips with a smartphone application. We believe CASSPIT will eliminate our reliance on RT-qPCR by providing comparable sensitivity and will be a step toward establishing nucleic acid-based point-of-care (POC) testing for COVID-19.","Azmi, Iqbal; Faizan, Md Imam; Kumar, Rohit; Raj Yadav, Siddharth; Chaudhary, Nisha; Kumar Singh, Deepak; Butola, Ruchika; Ganotra, Aryan; Datt Joshi, Gopal; Deep Jhingan, Gagan; Iqbal, Jawed; Joshi, Mohan C.; Ahmad, Tanveer",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33796478/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.632646,209

Mouse models allow direct assessment of host genetic factors responsible for susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Based on an assessment of early stage lines from the Collaborative Cross mouse multi-parent population, we identified two lines showing highly divergent susceptibilities to SARS-CoV: the resistant CC003/Unc and the susceptible CC053/Unc. We generated 264 F2 mice between these strains, and infected them with SARS-CoV. Weight loss, pulmonary hemorrhage, and viral load were all highly correlated disease phenotypes. We identified a quantitative trait locus of major effect on chromosome 18 (27.1–58.6 Mb) which affected weight loss, viral titer and hemorrhage. Additionally, each of these three phenotypes had distinct quantitative trait loci [Chr 9 (weight loss), Chrs 7 and 12 (virus titer), and Chr 15 (hemorrhage)]. We identified Ticam2, an adaptor protein in the TLR signaling pathways, as a candidate driving differential disease at the Chr 18 locus. Ticam2(−/−) mice were highly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, exhibiting increased weight loss and more pulmonary hemorrhage than control mice. These results indicate a critical role for Ticam2 in SARS-CoV disease, and highlight the importance of host genetic variation in disease responses.","Gralinski, Lisa E.; Menachery, Vineet D.; Morgan, Andrew P.; Totura, Allison L.; Beall, Anne; Kocher, Jacob; Plante, Jessica; Harrison-Shostak, D.

While large-scale sequencing efforts have identified numerous genetic variants in SARS-CoV-2 during its circulation, it remains largely unclear whether many of these changes impact adaptation, replication or transmission of the virus. Here, we characterized 14 different low-passage replication-competent human SARS-CoV-2 isolates representing all major European clades observed during the first pandemic wave in early 2020. By integrating viral sequencing data from patient material, virus stocks, and passaging experiments, together with kinetic virus replication data from non-human Vero-CCL81 cells and primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (BEpCs), we observed several SARS-CoV-2 features that associate with distinct phenotypes. Notably, naturally-occurring variants in Orf3a (Q57H) and nsp2 (T85I) were associated with poor replication in Vero-CCL81 cells but not in BEpCs, while SARS-CoV-2 isolates expressing the Spike D614G variant generally exhibited enhanced replication abilities in BEpCs. Strikingly, low-passage Vero-derived stock preparation of 3 SARS-CoV-2 isolates selected for substitutions at positions 5/6 of E, and were highly attenuated in BEpCs, revealing a key cell-specific function to this region. Rare isolate-specific deletions were also observed in the Spike furin-cleavage site during Vero-CCL81 passage, but these were rapidly selected against in BEpCs, underscoring the importance of this site for SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human cells. Overall, our study uncovers sequence features in SARS-CoV-2 variants that determine cell-specific virus replication, and highlights the need to monitor SARS-CoV-2 stocks carefully when phenotyping newly emerging variants or potential variants-of-concern.","Pohl, Marie O.; Busnadiego, Idoia; Kufner, Verena; Glas, Irina; Karakus, Umut; Schmutz, Stefan; Zaheri, Maryam; Abela, Irene; Trkola, Alexandra; Huber, Michael; Stertz, Silke; Hale, Benjamin G.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.22.350207,209

Various glucocorticoids regimens have been proposed. Methods Retrospective observational study that includes patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and compares admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or death during hospitalization in three groups of patients: no glucocorticoids treatment, use of glucocorticoids doses equivalent to less than 250 mg of prednisone daily and use of equivalent doses greater than or equal to 250 mg of prednisone daily. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression, using the propensity index as a covariant. Results Of the 259 patients enrolled in the study, 67 (25.9%) had an unfavorable evolution, dying or requiring ICU admission. Comparative analyzes between different glucocorticoids treatments and the association with ICU admission or death were: glucocorticoids treatment (any dose) versus no glucocorticoids treatment (OR: 0.71 (0.30-1.66)), treatment with glucocorticoids (≥ 250 mg prednisone daily) versus no glucocorticoids treatment (OR: 0.35 (0.11-1.08)) and glucocorticoids treatment (≥ 250 mg prednisone daily) versus patients with glucocorticoids doses <250 mg prednisone daily or without glucocorticoids treatment (OR: 0.30 (0.10-0.88)). Conclusion The results of this study show that patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia treated with glucocorticoids pulses with equivalent doses of prednisone greater than or equal to 250 mg have a more favorable evolution (less mortality and less admission to ICU).","Pascual Pareja, José Francisco; García-Caballero, Rebeca; Rangel, Llanos Soler; Vázquez-Ronda, Miguel Angel; Franco, Silvia Roa; Jiménez, Gema Navarro; Palanco, Miguel Angel Moreno; González-Ruano, Patricia; López-Menchaca, Ramiro; Ruíz-Seco, Pilar; Muñoz, Bárbara Pagán; Gómez, Alejandro Gómez; Pérez-Monte, Beatriz; Martínez, Rebeca Fuerte; López, Jose Luis Valle; Blanco, Arturo Muñoz; Lorite, Isabel Rábago; Martín, Patricia Martínez; San Martín, Gonzalo Serralta; y Jorge Francisco, Gómez-Cerezo",Med Clin (Engl Ed),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medcle.2020.11.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2387020621000541; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33585689/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2387020621000541?v=s5,209

The public's gaze is focused on the urgent health crisis, while many children are at risk due to social isolation and reduced social services. OBJECTIVE: Examine child protection in Israel during COVID-19, as portrayed in mainstream news media and government policy documents. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study analyzed all policy documents and mainstream media reports published in Israel from March to May 2020, during the initial mandatory nationwide quarantine. METHODS: (1) Search of relevant articles in mainstream news websites; (2) Search of documents in official websites of relevant government ministries and agencies. RESULTS: 28 government policy documents and 22 media articles were found relevant. When examined chronologically, what stood out was the initial decision to shut down social services, including some of the residential care units for youth at risk, and declare social workers “non-essential”. These decisions were revoked a few weeks into the quarantine, following persistent media pressure by child advocates, resulting in minor changes in policy. CONCLUSION: Children were initially invisible to Israeli policymakers facing the pandemic, highlighting the centrality of advocates promoting children's rights and of mainstream news media in disseminating the discourse of protecting children from maltreatment, especially in times of crisis. Moreover, the study points to the heightened threat to at-risk children due to inadequate policies, and to the urgent need to develop child protection policies in order to avoid further risk in future global crises.","Katz, Carmit; Noa, Cohen",Child Abuse Negl,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145213420304257?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071026/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0145213420304257; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104770,209
630779,Hyper-Inflammatory Response Involves in Cardiac Injury among Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021-02-12,"The world faces a high alert of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), leading to a million deaths and could become infected to reach a billion numbers. A sizeable amount of scholarly work has been available on different aspects of social-economic and environmental factors. At the same time, many of these studies found the linear (direct) causation between the stated factors. In many cases, the direct relationship is not apparent. The world is unsure about the possible determining factors of the COVID-19 pandemic, which need to be known through conducting nonlinearity (indirect) relationships, which caused the pandemic crisis. The study examined the nonlinear relationship between COVID-19 cases and carbon damages, managing financial development, renewable energy consumption, and innovative capability in a cross section of 65 countries. The results show that inbound foreign direct investment first increases and later decreases because of the increasing coronavirus cases. Further, the rise and fall in the research and development expenditures and population density exhibits increasing coronavirus cases across countries. The continued economic growth initial decreases later increase by adopting standardized operating procedures to contain coronavirus disease. The inter-temporal relationship shows that green energy source and carbon damages would likely influence the coronavirus cases with a variance of 17.127% and 5.440%, respectively, over a time horizon. The policymakers should be carefully designing sustainable healthcare policies, as the cost of carbon emissions leads to severe healthcare issues, which are likely to get exposed to contagious diseases, including COVID-19. The sustainable policy instruments, including renewable fuels in industrial production, advancement in cleaner production technologies, the imposition of carbon taxes on dirty production, and environmental certifications, are a few possible remedies that achieve healthcare sustainability agenda globally.","Anser, Muhammad Khalid; Godil, Danish Iqbal; Khan, Muhammad Azhar; Nassani, Abdelmohsen A.; Askar, Sameh E.; Zaman, Khalid; Salamun, Hailan; Sasmoko; Indrianti, Yasinta; Abro, Muhammad Moinuddin Qazi",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15978-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34424465/,209

Results From the instigation of the NHSE contract with the Independent Sector up until 28th June 2020 The Norfolk and Norwich University NHS Trust (NNUH) delivered 9016 episodes of care including 576 surgical episodes at its nearby Independent Hospital. During the time that a seven day household isolation period was required, no patients from the 31 tested postoperatively were recorded as testing positive for Covid-19. In the month after moving to a mandatory 14 day period of household isolation, 29 patients had their surgery postponed as they were unable to comply with the required period of isolation. Conclusion Working cooperatively with the independent sector can deliver significant additional capacity for the NHS. Fourteen days household isolation may impact on a patient’s decision to have surgery, despite, in some cases, that surgery being time-sensitive. The recommendation from NICE reducing the length of isolation largely reversed this impact.","Barker, T.; Barker, P.; Sokalsky, L.; McNamara, I.",Surgeon,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1479666X20301530; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1479666X20301530?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surge.2020.09.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33172728/,209

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess health care workers’ knowledge and practice of proper face mask utilization to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection in Amhara region referral hospitals, Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional institutional-based quantitative study design was conducted from May 15 to 30/2020 using pre-tested self-administrated questionnaire and analyzed by using SPSS version 20.0. The study included 422 health care providers, and the sample size was determined using a single population proportion formula with the assumption of a p value of 0.05. Data were collected using a consecutive sampling technique from all referral hospitals and were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Finally, the outcome was presented in the form of a text and a table. RESULTS: The overall knowledge and practice of health care providers regarding proper face mask utilization were 278 (65.8%) and 252 (59.5%), respectively. Of them, 284 (67.3%) knew that face masks were worn with the white side facing in, 264 (62.6%) knew that face masks had three layers, and 331 (78.4%) knew that surgical face masks were worn for up to 8 hours. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: The respondent’s knowledge of proper face mask usage was high, in comparison with another studies but the proper utilization of face mask was relatively low. Ethiopian ministry of health in collaboration with Amhara region, zonal and woreda health institution works together to increase utilization of face mask and to alleviate scarcity of resource and provide training to the health care providers about the proper utilization of face mask to tackle COVID-19.","Seid Yimer, Tigist; Gebrehana Belay, Habtamu",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34234446/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s306253,209

We assessed the local performance of ERCP during the first wave of COVID-19 at our local endoscopy center, in particular the technique to common bile duct (CBD) cannulation. Methodology All ERCP procedures performed from January to June 2020 were retrospectively assessed and compared with procedures performed between January and June 2019 at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary. The indications for ERCP, success rate, and complications were studied separately. Correlation analysis was conducted using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. The binary logistic regression model was used to compute the factors associated with successful ERCP. Significance was established when the two-sided P-value < 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 25 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA, 2017). Results A total of 281 ERCP were included in this study, with 169 and 112 performed during the first six months of 2019 and 2020, respectively. A statistically significant (0.0087) higher proportion of cases with liver dysfunction presented for ERCP before the COVID-19 outbreak (152, 89.94%). All patients before COVID-19 underwent wire control-assisted ERCP, while 82 (73.21%) received assisted ERCP during the first wave (P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference (P = 0.10) in the number of patients who underwent sphincterotomy before and during the first wave of COVID-19, with 97 (57.39%) and 76 (67.85%), respectively. The success rate of ERCP before COVID-19 was relatively high, accounting for 146 (86.39%) patients in contrast to 87 (77.67%) patients during the first wave (P = 0.074). Sphincterotomy (β = 2.800, P = 0.028) and stent insertion (β = 0.852, P = 0.046) were statistically significant predictors of ERCP outcomes. There was no statistically significant impact of cholangitis on the success of ERCP (β = 1.672, P = 0.109). Conclusion The first wave of COVID-19 had a statistically proven negative impact on the expected standards of ERCP performance. Although the complication rate was significantly higher during the first wave case difficulty, the American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) status was not assessed on an individual basis. Both ASA status and case difficulty are now included in our endoscopy selection process. We recommend adding the complexity of cases and ASA to the local and national recording databases. This is a rare study on UK-based hospitals.","Gadour, Eyad; Agu, Okwudili; Musharaf, Mutwakil; Dixon, Megan; Askar, Amr; Hafeez, Siddrah; Shafiq, Yousuf; Arabiyat, Abdalla; Moradi, Julia",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34522563/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17861,209

Using data collected from health care worker interactions with hospitalized patients with COVID-19 illness, we calculated the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 via the airborne route. OBJECTIVES/METHODS: Healthcare worker interaction with SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were tracked using a real time location system between March 18 and March 31. A value for q, the transmissibility expressed as quanta per hour, was estimated using a well-established model for airborne transmission. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence among tracked HCWs was 2.21% (0.07-4.35). Transmissibility was estimated to be 0.225 quanta per hour, well below other well-characterized airborne pathogens. Simulations demonstrated that risk of infection is substantially reduced with increased ventilation of rooms. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not well transmitted via the airborne route in controlled conditions. We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may be only opportunistically airborne, with most transmission occurring via droplet methods.","Hota, B.; Stein, B.; Lin, M.; Tomich, A.; Segreti, J.; Weinstein, R.

637806,Characteristics and predicting factors of Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) among healthcare providers in a developing country,2021-01-20,"p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that can be activated in many contexts, such as DNA damage or stressful conditions. p53 has also been shown to be important for responses to certain viral infections. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a major enteric pathogen of the coronavirus family that causes extensive mortality among piglets. The involvement of p53 during PEDV infection has not previously been investigated. In this study, we detected p53 upregulation in response to PEDV infection. Treatment with a p53 specific activator or p53 overexpression markedly decreased viral replication, and we showed that there was more viral progeny produced in p53 knock-out cells than in p53 wild-type cells. Finally, we demonstrated that inhibition of viral infection by p53 was mediated via p53-dependent IFN signaling, leading to IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) activation, as well as the upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and IFN-β released from infected cells. These findings demonstrate that p53 suppresses PEDV infection, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for combatting this deadly disease in piglets.","Hao, Zhichao; Fu, Fang; Cao, Liyan; Guo, Longjun; Liu, Jianbo; Xue, Mei; Feng, Li",Mol Immunol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589018307788; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2019.02.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589018307788; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784764/,209

Nevertheless, CBIT is rarely available due to various barriers. This study evaluated the feasibility and potential effectiveness of an Internet-based, self-help CBIT program (ICBIT) guided by parents with minimal therapist support delivered via telepsychotherapy. Forty-one youths, aged 7–18 years, were randomly assigned to receive either ICBIT (n = 25) or a wait-list (WL) condition (n = 16) in a crossover design. ICBIT was feasible to implement and at post-treatment, 64% of the participants have improved significantly. Results demonstrated clinically meaningful reductions in tic severity and improved youth global impairment and functioning. Gains were maintained over a 6-month follow-up period. The effect size for the primary outcome measure (Yale Global Tic Severity Scale) ranged between large effect size (Cohen”s d = 0.91) at post-intervention to very large effect size (Cohen’s d = 2.25) 6 months after the end of the acute intervention. These were comparable to face-to-face delivery treatment trials for TD. Participants rated the intervention as highly acceptable and satisfactory. Youth receiving ICBIT experienced improvement in self-esteem and comorbidity. Finally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the ICBIT program enabled the delivery of the intervention consecutively without interruption. The results observed provide preliminary evidence of the feasibility and effectiveness of this innovative modality to assist youth with TD and remove various barriers to treatment, including those during a public crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: Forty-five women with term pregnancies with confirmed non-severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (case group), and 96 SARS-CoV-2 negative women in identical conditions (control group) were approached, using consecutive sample. Weekly (1st to 5th week postpartum) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in nasopharyngeal swabs (cases) and breastmilk (cases and controls) were obtained. Concentration of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in breastmilk (cases and controls) were determined at 1st and 5th week post-partum. RESULTS: Thirty-seven (study group) and 45 (control group) women were enrolled. Symptomatic infection occurred in 56.8% of women in the study group (48% fever, 48% anosmia, 43% cough). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not found in breastmilk samples. Concentrations of cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-1ra, IL-4, IL-6, IL-9, IL-13, and TNF-α) chemokines (eotaxin, IP-10, MIP-1α, and RANTES) and growth factors (FGF, GM-CSF, IL7, and PDGF-BB) were higher in breastmilk of the study compared with the control group at 1st week postpartum. Immune compounds concentrations decreased on time, particularly in the control group milk samples. Time of nasopharyngeal swab to become negative influenced the immune compound concentration pattern. Severity of disease (symptomatic or asymptomatic infection) did not affect the immunological profile in breast milk. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms no viral RNA and a distinct immunological profile in breastmilk according to mother’s SARS-CoV-2 status.

The current study aimed to determine whether unique brain endophenotypes predict the COVID-19 infection risk. Methods: This research was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource. Functional magnetic resonance imaging scans acquired before the COVID-19 pandemic in a cohort of general population older adults (n=3,662) were used to compute the whole-brain functional connectomes. A network-informed machine learning approach was used to identify connectome and nodal fingerprints that predicted positive COVID-19 status during the pandemic up to February 4th, 2021. Results: Brain scans, acquired an average of 3 years before COVID-19 testing, significantly predicted the infection results. The predictive models successfully identified 6 fingerprints that were associated with COVID-19 positive, compared to negative status (all p values < 0.005). Overall, lower integration across the brain modules and increased segregation, as reflected by internal within module connectivity, were associated with higher infection rates. More specifically, COVID-19 infections were predicted by 1) reduced connectivity between the central executive and ventral salience, as well as between the dorsal salience and default mode networks; 2) increased internal connectivity within the default mode, ventral salience, subcortical and sensorimotor networks; and 3) increased connectivity between the ventral salience, subcortical and sensorimotor networks. Conclusion: Individuals are at increased risk of COVID-19 infections if their brain connectome is consistent with reduced connectivity in the top-down attention and executive networks, along with increased internal connectivity in the introspective and instinctive networks.","Abdallah, C.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.01.21254709; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.01.21254709v1?rss=1,209

HMPV, which is closely related to avian metapneumovirus subtype C, has circulated for at least 65 years, and nearly every child will be infected with HMPV by the age of 5. However, immunity is incomplete, and re-infections occur throughout adult life. Symptoms are similar to those of other respiratory viral infections, ranging from mild (cough, rhinorrhea, and fever) to more severe (bronchiolitis and pneumonia). The preferred method for diagnosis is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction as HMPV is difficult to culture. Although there have been many advances made in the past 16 years since its discovery, there are still no US Food and Drug Administration-approved antivirals or vaccines available to treat HMPV.

ID is estimated to be present in up to 50% of outpatients and is a strong independent predictor of HF outcomes. ID has been shown to reduce quality of life, exercise capacity and survival, in both the presence and absence of anemia. The most recent 2016 guidelines recommend starting replacement treatment at ferritin cutoff value <100 mcg/l or between 100 and 299 mcg/l when the transferrin saturation is <20%. Beyond its effect on hemoglobin, iron plays an important role in oxygen transport and in the metabolism of cardiac and skeletal muscles. Mitochondria are the most important sites of iron utilization and energy production. These factors clearly have roles in the diminished exercise capacity in HF. Oral iron administration is usually the first route used for iron repletion in patients. However, the data from the IRONOUT HF study do not support the use of oral iron supplementation in patients with HF and a reduced ejection fraction, because this treatment does not affect peak VO(2) (the primary endpoint of the study) or increase serum ferritin levels. The FAIR-HF and CONFIRM-HF studies have shown improvements in symptoms, quality of life and functional capacity in patients with stable, symptomatic, iron-deficient HF after the administration of intravenous iron (i.e., FCM). Moreover, they have shown a decreased risk of first hospitalization for worsening of HF, as later confirmed in a subsequent meta-analysis. In addition, the EFFECT-HF study has shown an improvement in peak oxygen consumption at CPET (a parameter generally considered the gold standard of exercise capacity and a predictor of outcome in HF) in patients randomized to receive ferric carboxymaltose. Finally, the AFFIRM AHF trial evaluating the effects of FCM administration on the outcomes of patients hospitalized for acute HF has found significantly fewer hospital readmissions due to HF among patients treated with FCM rather than placebo.","Rizzo, Caterina; Carbonara, Rosa; Ruggieri, Roberta; Passantino, Andrea; Scrutinio, Domenico",Front Cardiovasc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34447793/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2021.709872,209

This virus pandemic has turned more complicated as individuals with co-morbidities like diabetes, cardiovascular conditions and obesity are at a high risk of acquiring infection and suffering from a more severe course of disease. Prolonged viral infection and obesity are independently known to lower the immune response and a combination can thus result in a “cytokine storm” and a substantial weakening of the immune system. With the rise in obesity cases globally, the chances that obese individuals will acquire infection and need hospitalization are heightened. In this review, we discuss why obesity, a low-grade chronic inflammation, contributes toward the increased severity in COVID-19 patients. We suggest that increased inflammation, activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, elevated adipokines and higher ectopic fat may be the factors contributing to the disease severity, in particular deteriorating the cardiovascular and lung function, in obese individuals. We look at the many lessons learnt from the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic and relate it to the very little but fast incoming information that is available from the SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with overweight and obesity.","Bhattacharya, Indranil; Ghayor, Chafik; Pérez Dominguez, Ana; Weber, Franz E.",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33123087/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.556962,209

655569,Towards Optimization of Hydroxychloroquine Dosing in Intensive Care Unit COVID-19 Patients,2020-04-07,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented global public health and economic crisis. The origin and emergence of its causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, in the human population remains mysterious, although bat and pangolin were proposed to be the natural reservoirs. Strikingly, unlike the SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses (CoVs) identified in bats and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 harbors a polybasic furin cleavage site in its spike (S) glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its receptor to infect cells. Receptor recognition by the S protein is the major determinant of host range, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis of coronaviruses. In an effort to search for the potential intermediate or amplifying animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2, we examined receptor activity of ACE2 from 14 mammal species and found that ACE2s from multiple species can support the infectious entry of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the wild-type or furin cleavage site-deficient S protein of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 of human/rhesus monkey and rat/mouse exhibited the highest and lowest receptor activities, respectively. Among the remaining species, ACE2s from rabbit and pangolin strongly bound to the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and efficiently supported the pseudotyped virus infection. These findings have important implications for understanding potential natural reservoirs, zoonotic transmission, human-to-animal transmission, and use of animal models. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as a primary receptor for host cell entry. Viral entry mediated by the interaction of ACE2 with spike protein largely determines host range and is the major constraint to interspecies transmission. We examined the receptor activity of 14 ACE2 orthologs and found that wild-type and mutant SARS-CoV-2 lacking the furin cleavage site in S protein could utilize ACE2 from a broad range of animal species to enter host cells. These results have important implications in the natural hosts, interspecies transmission, animal models, and molecular basis of receptor binding for SARS-CoV-2.","Zhao, Xuesen; Chen, Danying; Szabla, Robert; Zheng, Mei; Li, Guoli; Du, Pengcheng; Zheng, Shuangli; Li, Xinglin; Song, Chuan; Li, Rui; Guo, Ju-Tao; Junop, Murray; Zeng, Hui; Lin, Hanxin",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32661139/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00940-20,209
656787,Preserving 2 decades of healthcare gains for Africa in the coronavirus disease 2019 era,2020-10-01,"OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has overwhelmed healthcare resources even in wealthy nations, necessitating rationing of limited resources without previously established crisis standards of care protocols. In Massachusetts, triage guidelines were designed based on acute illness and chronic life-limiting conditions. In this study, we sought to retrospectively validate this protocol to cohorts of critically ill patients from our hospital. DESIGN: We applied our hospital-adopted guidelines, which defined severe and major chronic conditions as those associated with a greater than 50% likelihood of 1- and 5-year mortality, respectively, to a critically ill patient population. We investigated mortality for the same intervals. SETTING: An urban safety-net hospital ICU. PATIENTS: All adults hospitalized during April of 2015 and April 2019 identified through a clinical database search. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 365 admitted patients, 15.89% had one or more defined chronic life-limiting conditions. These patients had higher 1-year (46.55% vs 13.68%; p < 0.01) and 5-year (50.00% vs 17.22%; p < 0.01) mortality rates than those without underlying conditions. Irrespective of classification of disease severity, patients with metastatic cancer, congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and neurodegenerative disease had greater than 50% 1-year mortality, whereas patients with chronic lung disease and cirrhosis had less than 50% 1-year mortality. Observed 1- and 5-year mortality for cirrhosis, heart failure, and metastatic cancer were more variable when subdivided into severe and major categories. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with major and severe chronic medical conditions overall had 46.55% and 50.00% mortality at 1 and 5 years, respectively. However, mortality varied between conditions. Our findings appear to support a crisis standards protocol which focuses on acute illness severity and only considers underlying conditions carrying a greater than 50% predicted likelihood of 1-year mortality. Modifications to the chronic lung disease, congestive heart failure, and cirrhosis criteria should be refined if they are to be included in future models.","Nadjarian, Albert; LeClair, Jessica; Mahoney, Taylor F.; Awtry, Eric H.; Bhatia, Jasvinder S.; Caruso, Lisa B.; Clay, Alexis; Greer, David; Hingorani, Karan S.; Horta, L.

We describe here the characterization of a temperature-sensitive mutant of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59) having multiple S protein-related defects. The most remarkable of these was that the mutant, designated Albany 18 (Alb 18), assembled virions devoid of the S glycoprotein at the nonpermissive temperature. Alb18 also failed to bring about syncytia formation in cells infected at the nonpermissive temperature. Virions of the mutant assembled at the permissive temperature were much more thermolabile than wild type. Moreover, mutant S protein that was incorporated into virions at the permissive temperature showed enhanced pH-dependent thermolability in its ability to bind to the MHV receptor. Alb18 was found to have a single point mutation in S resulting in a change of serine 287 to isoleucine, and it was shown by revertant analysis that this was the lesion responsible for the phenotype of the mutant.","Ricard, Cynthia S.; Koetzner, Cheri A.; Sturman, Lawrence S.; Masters, Paul S.",Virus Research,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016817029500100X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/016817029500100X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8837889/,209
657349,Novel coronavirus disease 2019 and perinatal outcomes,2020-04-28,"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is considered a risk factor for poor outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, data on the prognostic impact of radiological emphysema extent on patients with COVID-19 are limited. Thus, this study aimed to examine whether computed tomography (CT)-quantified emphysema score is associated with a worse clinical outcome in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Volumetric quantitative analyses of CT images were performed to obtain emphysema scores in COVID-19 patients admitted to four tertiary referral hospitals in Daegu, South Korea, between February 18 and March 25, 2020. Patients were divided into three groups according to emphysema score (emphysema score ≤1%, 1%< emphysema score ≤5%, and emphysema score >5%). RESULTS: A total of 146 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The median emphysema score was 1.0% (interquartile range, 0.5–1.8%). Eight patients (6%) had a previous COPD diagnosis. Eighty (55%), 55 (38%), and 11 (8%) patients had emphysema scores ≤1%, between 1% and 5%, and >5%, respectively. The number of patients who received oxygen therapy two weeks after admission was significantly higher in the group with emphysema scores >5% than in other groups (p=0.025). The frequency of deaths was three (27%) in the group with emphysema scores >5% and tended to be higher than that in other groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that age, COPD, and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels were associated with a greater risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrated that patients with CT-quantified emphysema scores >5% tended to progress to severe disease over time; however, they did not exhibit an increased risk of mortality in our COVID-19 cohort. Further studies with consideration of both emphysema extent and airflow limitation degree are warranted.","Lim, Jae-Kwang; Park, Byunggeon; Park, Jongmin; Choi, Keum-Ju; Jung, Chi-Young; Kim, Young Hwan; Kim, Jin Young; Moon, Sungjun; Lee, Yong Hoon; Lee, Jaehee",Int J Gen Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34285557/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s317295,209

This may have serious consequences for the overall well-being of HCWs, which in turn may adversely affect patient safety and the productivity of the institution. AIMS: We designed a study to assess the prevalence of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), depression and work-related stress experienced by the National Health Service staff in a large tertiary London hospital treating patients with COVID-19 during the current active phase of the COVID-19 era. METHODS: An anonymous survey was designed with demographic data and three questionnaires. The Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were used to assess anxiety and depression, respectively. The Health and Safety Executive Management Standards Indicator Tool was used to assess work-related stress. Staff from multiple specialties embracing cardiothoracic surgery, cardiology, respiratory medicine, endocrinology, oncology, imaging, anaesthesia and intensive care at our hospital were asked to complete the questionnaire between 25 May and 15 June 2020. RESULTS: A total of 302 staff members (106 males and 196 females) completed the survey. The overall prevalence of GAD and depression was 41.4% and 42.7%, respectively. The prevalence of GAD and depression was significantly higher in females than in males and was statistically significant. Nurses were four times more likely to report moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depression as compared with doctors. Work-related stress was also observed to be prevalent in our surveyed population with the following standards: relationships, role, control and change showing a need for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents early evidence suggestive of a high prevalence of GAD, depression and work-related stress in HCWs. It is imperative that coherent strategies are implemented to improve the healthcare work environment during this pandemic and mitigate further injury to the mental health status of the healthcare population.","Ike, Ikenna David; Durand-Hill, Matthieu; Elmusharaf, Eiman; Asemota, Nicole; Silva, Elizabeth; White, Elliott; Awad, Wael I",Gen Psychiatr,https://doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100368; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192241/,209

To obtain a more sensitive and convenient diagnosis of the disease, we prepared monoclonal antibodies specific for the FeLV p27 to develop a rapid diagnostic test with enhanced sensitivity and specificity. Among these antibodies, we identified two clones (hybridomas 8F8B5 and 8G7D1) that specifically bound to FeLV and were very suitable for a diagnostic kit. The affinity constants for 8F8B5 and 8G7D1 were 0.35 × 10(9) and 0.86 × 10(9), respectively. To investigate the diagnostic abilities of the rapid kit using these antibodies, we performed several clinical studies. Assessment of analytical sensitivity revealed that the detection threshold of the rapid diagnostic test was 2 ng/mL for recombinant p27 and 12.5 × 10(4) IU/mL for FeLV. When evaluating 252 cat sera samples, the kit was found to have a kappa value of 0.88 compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR), indicating a significant correlation between data from the rapid diagnostic test and PCR. Sensitivity and specificity of the kit were 95.2% (20/21) and 98.5% (257/261), respectively. Our results demonstrated that the rapid diagnostic test would be a suitable diagnostic tool for the rapid detection of FeLV infection in cats.","Kim, Won-Shik; Chong, Chom-Kyu; Kim, Hak-Yong; Lee, Gyu-Cheol; Jeong, Wooseog; An, Dong-Jun; Jeoung, Hye-Young; Lee, Jae-In; Lee, Young-Ki",J Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24136209/,209

Like SARS previously and Zika recently, the Ebola crisis in 2015 showed how vulnerable the world is to these epidemics, with over 11,000 people dying in the outbreak. In addition to causing immense human suffering, these epidemics particularly affect low- and middle-income countries. Many of these deadly infectious diseases that have epidemic potential can become global health emergencies in the absence of effective vaccines. But very few vaccines against these threats have been developed to create proven medical products. The measles vaccine is an efficient, live attenuated, replicating virus that has been safely administered to 2 billion children over the last 40 years, affording life-long protection after a single dose. Taking advantage of these characteristics, this attenuated virus was transformed into a versatile chimeric or recombinant vaccine vector with demonstrated proof-of-principle in humans and a preclinical track record of rapid adaptability and effectiveness for a variety of pathogens. Clinical trials have shown the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine platform in individuals with preexisting immunity to measles.

There are very few studies on the involvement and the real impact of COVID-19 in nursing homes. This study analysed factors related to morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in institutionalised elderly people. Methods: This cohort study included 842 individuals from 12 nursing homes in Sant Cugat del Vallès (Spain) from 15 March to 15 May 2020. We evaluated individual factors (demographic, dependence, clinical, and therapeutic) and those related to the nursing homes (size and staff) associated with infection and mortality by SARS-CoV-2. Infection was diagnosed by molecular biology test. Results: Of the 842 residents included in the analysis, 784 underwent a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test; 74.2% were women, the mean age was 87.1 years, and 11.1% died. The PCR test was positive in 44%. A total of 33.4% of the residents presented symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and of these, 80.9% were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. Infection by SARS-CoV-2 among residents was associated with the rate of staff infected in the homes. Mortality by SARS-CoV-2 was related to male sex and a greater grade of dependence measured with the Barthel index. Conclusions: SARS-Cov-2 infection in institutionalised people is associated with the infection rate in nursing home workers and mortality by SARS-Cov-2 with sex and greater dependency according to the Barthel index. Adequate management of nursing home staff and special attention to measures of infection control, especially of individuals with greater dependence, are keys for successful management of future pandemic situations.","Burgaña Agoües, Ander; Serra Gallego, Marta; Hernández Resa, Raquel; Joven Llorente, Beatriz; Lloret Arabi, Maria; Ortiz Rodriguez, Jessica; Puig Acebal, Helena; Campos Hernández, Mireia; Caballero Ayala, Itziar; Pavón Calero, Pedro; Losilla Calle, Montserrat; Bueno Nieto, Rosario; Oliver Messeguer, Laura; Madridejos Mora, Rosa; Abellana Sangrà, Rosa; Perez-Porcuna, Tomás M.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639522/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910221,209

This situation urges the identification of underlying risks and preferably biomarkers for evidence-based, more effective healthcare. Towards this goal, current literature review and network analysis synthesize available information on the AD-related gene APOE into four lines of mechanistic evidence. At a cellular level, the risk isoform APOE4 confers high infectivity by the underlying coronavirus SARS-CoV-2; at a genetic level, APOE4 is associated with severe COVID-19; at a pathway level, networking connects APOE with COVID-19 risk factors such as ACE2, TMPRSS2, NRP1, and LZTFL1; at a behavioral level, APOE4-associated dementia may increase the exposure to coronavirus infection which causes COVID-19. Thus, APOE4 could exert multiple actions for high infection and mortality rates of the patients, or generally, with COVID-19.","Xiong, Nian; Schiller, Martin R.; Li, Jingwen; Chen, Xiaowu; Lin, Zhicheng",Alzheimers Res Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118974/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13195-021-00858-9,209

All mice except the sham group were irradiated and then administered for one week. The radioprotective effect on hematopoietic system, serum cytokines, and intestinal toxicity was studied. Protective effects on spleen and thymus are found in IR-treated groups. IR assisted in restoration of leukocytopenia after whole mice irradiation with significant reduction of serum TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. These enhancements of hematopoietic effects are due to an increase in the serum G-CSF concentration in IR treated groups. In histopathological assessment, significant improvement of intestine toxicity is observed in high-dose IR and L-glutamine group. Evidences show that IR has potentials to be a radioprotector, especially in recovery of hematopoietic system, reduction of inflammatory cytokines and intestinal toxicity.

The purpose of this study was to assess spine surgeon reliance on virtual medicine during the pandemic and to discuss the future of virtual medicine in spine surgery. METHODS: A comprehensive survey addressing demographic data and virtual medicine practices was distributed to spine surgeons worldwide between March 27, 2020, and April 4, 2020. RESULTS: 902 spine surgeons representing seven global regions responded. 35.6% of surgeons were identified as “high telehealth users,” conducting more than half of clinic visits virtually. Predictors of high telehealth utilization included working in an academic practice (OR = 1.68, p = 0.0015) and practicing in Europe/North America (OR 3.42, p < 0.0001). 80.1% of all surgeons were interested in online education. Dedicating more than 25% of one’s practice to teaching (OR = 1.89, p = 0.037) predicted increased interest in online education. 26.2% of respondents were identified as “virtual medicine surgeons,” defined as surgeons with both high telehealth usage and increased interest in online education. Living in Europe/North America and practicing in an academic practice increased odds of being a virtual medicine surgeon by 2.28 (p = 0.002) and 1.15 (p = 0.0082), respectively. 93.8% of surgeons reported interest in a centralized platform facilitating surgeon-to-surgeon communication.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty Patients were enrolled in the study, they were subjected to complete history taking, physical examination, laboratory investigations including complete blood count, blood gases, blood chemistry, bacteriological culture for sputum and blood, serology for atypicals, and PCR for respiratory viruses, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and PCT levels were measured. The patients were divided into two groups, group 1 included 26 patients who were culture negative for bacterial infection and group 2 included 34 patients who were culture positive. Group 2 patients were given antibiotic therapy according to the culture sensitivity. RESULT: The results revealed that, there was no significant difference between group 1 and group 2 patients as regards age, sex, clinical manifestations, final diagnosis, white blood cell counts, blood gases, number of admitted patients, intensive care unit admission and length of hospital stay. A significant increase of PCT and CRP levels was detected in group 2 compared to group 1 at initial diagnosis. At cutoff value >0.5 ng/ml, PCT gave a sensitivity of 94.1%, specificity of 88.4%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 91.4%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 92% and diagnostic efficiency of 91.6% for diagnosis of respiratory tract bacterial infections. However, at a cutoff value >8 mg/L, CRP gave a sensitivity of 85.2%, specificity of 76.9%, PPV of 82.8%, NPV of 80% and diagnostic efficiency of 81.7%. After antibiotic therapy PCT and CRP levels dropped in group 2 patients as compared to their pre-treatment levels. CONCLUSION: Serum PCT level could be used as a novel marker of lower respiratory tract bacterial infections for diagnosis, prognosis and follow up of therapy. This reduces side-effects of an unnecessary antibiotic use, lowers costs, and in the long-term, leads to diminishing drug resistance.","El-Azeem, Amal Abd; Hamdy, Gehan; Saraya, Mohamed; Fawzy, Esmat; Anwar, Enas; Abdulattif, Sherif",Egypt J Chest Dis Tuberc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288126/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcdt.2013.07.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0422763813001763; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0422763813001763,209

However, the function of P2 receptors in viral infection has been little explored. Here we demonstrated that P2Y(13) and its ligand ADP play an important role in protecting hosts from viral infections. First, we demonstrate that P2Y(13), as a typical interferon-stimulated gene, is induced together with extracellular ADP during viral infection. Most importantly, extracellular ADP restricts the replication of different kinds of viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus, Newcastle disease virus, herpes simplex virus 1, and murine leukemia virus. This kind of protection is dependent on P2Y(13) but not P2Y(1) or P2Y(12), which are also considered as receptors for ADP. Furthermore, cyclic adenosine monophosphate and EPAC1 are downregulated by extracellular ADP through the P2Y(13)-coupled Gi alpha subunit. Accordingly, inhibition or deletion of EPAC1 significantly eliminates ADP/P2Y(13)-mediated antiviral activities. Taken together, our results show that P2Y(13) and ADP play pivotal roles in the clearance of invaded virus and have the potential as antiviral targets.","Zhang, Chengfei; Yan, Yan; He, Hongwang; Wang, Li; Zhang, Na; Zhang, Jie; Huang, Hongjun; Wu, Nannan; Ren, Hua; Qian, Min; Liu, Mingyao; Du, Bing",J Mol Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30137373/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jmcb/mjy045,209

Optical and structural properties of nanostructures were optimized in reference to measurements made by using UV/Vis absorption spectrophotometry (UV/Vis), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) supported by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (ATR FT-IR). In addition, concentrations of reducing sugars and polyphenols of honeys applied were determined to reveal the role of these chemical compounds in green synthesis of AuNPs. It was found that the smallest AuNPs (20.6 ± 23.3 nm) were produced using a 20% (w/v) multiflower aqueous honey solution and 25 mg·L(−1) of Au(III) ions. These AuNPs were then employed in microwave-induced hyperthermia in a system simulating metastatic tissues. This research illustrated that AuNPs, as produced with the aid of a multiflower honey solution, could be suitably used for microwave-induced heating of cancer. A fluid containing resultant Au nanostructures, as compared to water, revealed facilitated heating and the ability to maintain a temperature of 45 °C required for hyperthermia treatment.","Dzimitrowicz, Anna; Cyganowski, Piotr; Jamroz, Piotr; Jermakowicz-Bartkowiak, Dorota; Rzegocka, Malgorzata; Cwiklinska, Agnieszka; Pohl, Pawel",Materials (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ma12060898; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30889837/,209

We performed network meta-analyses to determine differences in blood cells, lymphocyte subsets, and cytokines in COVID-19 patients with different clinical stages. METHODS: Databases were systematically searched to May 2, 2020, and updated on June 1, 2020. Network meta-analyses were conducted via Stata 15.0, and the mean difference (MD) and its 95% CI were used as the effect values of the pooled analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-one studies were included involving 8647 COVID-19 patients, White blood cell (WBC), neutrophil (NEUT), IL-6, and IL-10 counts increased significantly with worsening of the COVID-19, while lymphocyte (LYM) counts decreased. The levels of platelet (PLT), CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), and CD19(+) cells in severe and critical patients were significantly lower than those in mild patients. IL-1β count was significantly elevated in critical patients. CONCLUSIONS: Immune suppression and inflammatory injury play crucial roles in the progression of COVID-19, and the identification of susceptible cells and cytokines provide guidance for the early and accurate treatment of COVID-19 patients.

Methods: An observational longitudinal study was conducted during the first year of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 (1st March 2020 to 1st March 2021). All pediatric patients attended at the rheumatology outpatient clinic of six tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain, with a medical diagnosis of RMD and COVID-19 were included. Main outcomes were symptomatic disease and hospital admission. The covariates were sociodemographic, clinical, and treatments. We ran a multivariable logistic regression model to assess risk factors for outcomes. Results: The study population included 77 pediatric patients. Mean age was 11.88 (4.04) years Of these, 30 patients were asymptomatic, 41 had a mild or moderate disease and other 6 patients (7.79%) required hospital admission related to COVID-19. The median length of stay was 5 (2-20) days and there was no death. Previous comorbidities increased the risk for symptomatic disease and hospital admission. Compared with outpatients, the factor independently associated with hospital admission was the use of glucocorticoids (OR 1.08; p=0.00). No statistically significant findings for symptomatic COVID-19 were found in the final model. Conclusion: Our data found no differences in COVID-19 outcomes between children-onset rheumatic diseases. Our results suggest that associated comorbidities and being in treatment with glucocorticoids increase the risk of hospital admission.","Clemente, D.; Udaondo, C.; de Inocencio, J.; Nieto, J.

It is known that among patients with hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cardiovascular diseases, COVID-19 is associated with greater morbidity and mortality compared with patients without these conditions. This correlation is of great importance in pregnant women affected by COVID-19, since it usually leads to the development of a serious clinical complication. In particular, managing hypertensive disorders in pregnancy can be problematic because antihypertensive medications may interact pharmacologically with drugs used to treat COVID-19. This review focuses on the safety of drug treatment for COVID-19 in pregnant women treated with antihypertensive medication. METHODS AND RESULTS: Several databases were searched to identify relevant literature. A few antihypertensive drugs and antithrombotic treatments are known for having a beneficial effect in the management of hypertension and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. In this review, we focus on the expected drug–drug interactions with the experimental agents most often used to treat COVID-19.

The roles of other types of indirect contact among farms is rarely accounted for. In addition, data on animal movements is seldom available in the United States. However, the spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) in U.S. swine represents one of the best documented emergences of a highly infectious pathogen in the U.S. livestock industry, providing an opportunity to parameterize models of pathogen spread via direct and indirect transmission mechanisms in swine. Using observed data on pig movements during the initial phase of the PEDv epidemic, we developed a network-based and spatially explicit epidemiological model that simulates the spread of PEDv via both indirect and direct movement-related contact in order to answer unresolved questions concerning factors facilitating between-farm transmission. By modifying the likelihood of each transmission mechanism and fitting this model to observed epidemiological dynamics, our results suggest that between-farm transmission was primarily driven by direct mechanisms related to animal movement and indirect mechanisms related to local spatial spread based on geographic proximity. However, other forms of indirect transmission among farms, including contact via contaminated vehicles and feed, were responsible for high consequence transmission events resulting in the introduction of the virus into new geographic areas.

Complying with such recommendations has required older as well as younger persons to change their daily lives in ways that have reduced their opportunities for engaging in many activities meaningful to them. AIMS: To find out from what sources older people have obtained information on protective measures, the level of their coronavirus-related health literacy (CHL), and whether CHL is associated with their perceptions of the restrictiveness of coronavirus-related protective measures. METHODS: 696 Finnish men and women aged over 77 answered a mailed questionnaire on their CHL, sources of information and perceptions of the restrictiveness of the recommended protective measures. The association of CHL with perceived restrictiveness was studied using multinomial logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Television and newspapers were the most frequently reported sources of information. Reporting high confidence in the ability to assess how one’s behavior influences coronavirus infection risk was associated with higher odds of perceiving the protective measures to be highly restrictive, when controlling for age, gender, and difficulty in using digital devices (OR 3.21, 95% CI 1.09, 9.46).

676032,The Estimated Time-Varying Reproduction Numbers during the Ongoing Epidemic of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China,2020-04-17,"The durability of infection-induced SARS-CoV-2 immunity has major implications for public health mitigation and vaccine development. Animal studies and the scarcity of confirmed re-infection suggests immune protection is likely, although the durability of this protection is debated. Lasting immunity following acute viral infection requires maintenance of both serum antibody and antigen-specific memory B and T lymphocytes and is notoriously pathogen specific, ranging from life-long for smallpox or measles4, to highly transient for common cold coronaviruses (CCC). Neutralising antibody responses are a likely correlate of protective immunity and exclusively recognise the viral spike (S) protein, predominantly targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the S1 sub-domain. Multiple reports describe waning of S-specific antibodies in the first 2-3 months following infection. However, extrapolation of early linear trends in decay might be overly pessimistic, with several groups reporting that serum neutralisation is stable over time in a proportion of convalescent subjects. While SARS-CoV-2 specific B and T cell responses are readily induced by infection, the longitudinal dynamics of these key memory populations remains poorly resolved. Here we comprehensively profiled antibody, B and T cell dynamics over time in a cohort recovered from mild-moderate COVID-19. We find that binding and neutralising antibody responses, together with individual serum clonotypes, decay over the first 4 months post-infection, as expected, with a similar decline in S-specific CD4+ and circulating T follicular helper (cTFH) frequencies. In contrast, S-specific IgG+ memory B cells (MBC) consistently accumulate over time, eventually comprising a significant fraction of circulating MBC. Modelling of the concomitant immune kinetics predicts maintenance of serological neutralising activity above a titre of 1:40 in 50% of convalescent subjects to 74 days, with probable additive protection from B and T cells. Overall, our study suggests SARS-CoV-2 immunity after infection is likely t 66 o be transiently protective at a population level. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may require greater immunogenicity and durability than natural infection to drive long-term protection.","Wheatley, A. K.; Juno, J. A.; Wang, J. J.; Selva, K.

680140,Potential Makeshift Solution to Coronavirus Disease 2019–Related N95 Mask Shortage,2020-07-10,"Background During infectious disease epidemics, a key question is whether cases travelling to new locations will trigger local outbreaks. The risk of this occurring depends on a range of factors, such as the transmissibility of the pathogen, the susceptibility of the host population and, crucially, the effectiveness of local surveillance in detecting cases and preventing onward spread. For many pathogens, presymptomatic and/or asymptomatic (together referred to here as nonsymptomatic) transmission can occur, making effective surveillance challenging. In this study, using COVID-19 as a case-study, we show how the risk of local outbreaks can be assessed when nonsymptomatic transmission can occur. Methods We construct a branching process model that includes nonsymptomatic transmission, and explore the effects of interventions targeting nonsymptomatic or symptomatic hosts when surveillance resources are limited. Specifically, we consider whether the greatest reductions in local outbreak risks are achieved by increasing surveillance and control targeting nonsymptomatic or symptomatic cases, or a combination of both. Findings Seeking to increase surveillance of symptomatic hosts alone is typically not the optimal strategy for reducing outbreak risks. Adopting a strategy that combines an enhancement of surveillance of symptomatic cases with efforts to find and isolate nonsymptomatic hosts leads to the largest reduction in the probability that imported cases will initiate a local outbreak. Interpretation During epidemics of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, effective surveillance for nonsymptomatic hosts can be crucial to prevent local outbreaks.

We reviewed baseline CXRs and clinical data of consecutive patients who presented to our emergency department and resulted positive at SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase–PCR oropharyngeal swab test from March 1, 2020 to April 6, 2020. Lung abnormalities and their distribution were analyzed. A score of CXR severity was assigned by two radiologists, independently, according to the extent of lung involvement, with a maximum score of 8 for CXR. Correlations between the CXR score and the clinical data were assessed. One hundred fifty-five patients were included; 143/155 (92%) were positive at baseline CXR. Ground-glass opacity was the most common finding (141/143, 99%). Involvement was mainly bilateral (96/143, 67%), with peripheral distribution (79/143, 55%). The mean CXR severity score was 3.3 (±2); interobserver agreement was excellent, with a Cohen’s K correlation coefficient of 0.901. The CXR score showed a significant positive correlation with C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and fever duration, and a negative correlation with oxygen saturation. Chest X-ray findings are in line with those reported by computed tomography studies.

682245,"Kidney manifestations of mild, moderate and severe coronavirus disease 2019: a retrospective cohort study",2020-05-09,"PURPOSE: Recent studies have demonstrated that obesity is significantly associated with increased disease severity, hospitalizations and mortality in COVID-19, with a potential role in the pathogenesis and prevalence in the new pandemic. The association with hepatic steatosis, however, a condition closely related to obesity within the spectrum of systemic metabolic dysfunctions, remains to be elucidated. We aimed to evaluate the frequency of hepatic steatosis as incidentally detected in chest CT examinations of COVID-19 positive patients in comparison to non-infected controls. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed with 316 patients (204 RT-PCR positive; 112 RT-PCR negative and chest CT negative). Steatosis was measured with placement of a single ROI in the right lobe of the liver (segments VI-VII) and defined as a liver attenuation value ≤ 40 HU. RESULTS: The frequency of hepatic steatosis was higher in the RT-PCR positive group in comparison to controls (31.9% vs. 7.1%, p < 0.001). Logistic linear regression analysis showed a 4.7 times odds of steatosis in the COVID-19 positive group as compared to controls after adjusting for age and sex (OR 4.698; 95% IC 2.12–10.41, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A significantly higher prevalence of steatosis was found among COVID-19 positive individuals. These findings are in accordance with other recent studies linking obesity and COVID-19 infection, as there is an intricate relationship between liver steatosis, metabolic syndrome and obesity. Further studies are required to confirm if such association remains after accounting for multiple variables, as well as possible relationships with disease severity and worst clinical outcomes.","Medeiros, Augusto Kreling; Barbisan, Cinthia Callegari; Cruz, Italo Ribeiro; de Araújo, Eduardo Medeiros; Libânio, Bruna Brandão; Albuquerque, Kamila Seidel; Torres, Ulysses S.",Abdom Radiol (NY),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32683613/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-020-02648-7,209

Marine sampling has dominated research in this field, despite the terrestrial origins of most plastic debris. Due to the high surface water connectivity facilitated by roadside ditches, these landscape features provide a unique sampling location linking terrestrial and surface water systems. We collected and analyzed macroplastic accumulation by number of pieces, mass, and polymer type in roadside ditches across four land uses, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Finger Lakes Region of New York State. Commercial land use plastic accumulation rate was highest, while forested land use accumulation rates were lowest on a piece basis. Pre-COVID-19 piece accumulation rates were significantly higher than COVID-19 piece accumulation rates across all land uses. Mass accumulation rates followed similar patterns observed in piece accumulation, but the patterns were not always statistically significant. Plastic type 4 (i.e. thin plastic films), especially plastic bags and wrappers, was the most frequently collected type of macroplastic by piece across all land uses within the 1-7 Resin Identification Codes. By mass, the data were distributed less consistently across land uses. Cigarette filters, containing the polymer cellulose acetate, were the most frequently found roadside plastic, but are not within the 1-7 classification system. Our results suggest that policies in place limiting plastic bag usage could substantially reduce roadside plastics but other plastics, such as food wrappers and other single use plastic films, which comprised a large proportion of the plastic debris collected, should also be regulated to further decrease macroplastic pollution.","Pietz, Olivia; Augenstein, Mary; Georgakakos, Christine B; Singh, Kanishka; McDonald, Miles; Walter, M Todd",Journal of environmental management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113524; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34403916/,209

Here, we used phylodynamic analyses to investigate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 during the outbreak. Using a Bayesian coalescent-based method, the estimated mean nucleotide substitution rate of 240 SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences was approximately 7.13 × 10−4 substitutions per site per year. Population dynamics and the effective reproductive number (Re) of SARS-CoV-2 infections were estimated using a Bayesian framework. The estimated origin of the outbreak was January 21, 2020. The infection spread substantially before quarantine on February 5. The Re peaked at 6.06 on February 4 and gradually declined to 1.51, suggesting that transmission continued slowly even after quarantine. These findings highlight the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and the need for effective measures to control outbreaks in confined settings.","Hoshino, Kunikazu; Maeshiro, Tatsuji; Nishida, Nao; Sugiyama, Masaya; Fujita, Jiro; Gojobori, Takashi; Mizokami, Masashi",Gene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33588037/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111921000901?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2021.145496; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378111921000901,209
685321,HEART BRAKE-An unusual cardiac manifestation of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020-05-03,"SUMMARY: We investigated whether osteoporotic fractures declined during lockdown, among adults aged 50 years and older. We showed that fewer outpatients attended the Fracture Clinic, for non-hip fractures, during lockdown; in contrast, no change in admissions for hip fractures was observed. This could be due to fewer outdoors falls, during lockdown. PURPOSE: Many countries implemented a lockdown to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. We explored whether outpatient attendances to the Fracture Clinic for non-hip fragility fracture and inpatient admissions for hip fracture declined during lockdown, among adults aged 50 years and older, in a large secondary care hospital. METHODS: In our observational study, we analysed the records of 6681 outpatients attending the Fracture Clinic, for non-hip fragility fractures, and those of 1752 inpatients, admitted for hip fracture, during the time frames of interest. These were weeks 1st to 12th in 2020 (“prior to lockdown”), weeks 13th to 19th in 2020 (“lockdown”) and corresponding periods over 2015 to 2019. We tested for differences in mean numbers (standard deviation (SD)) of outpatients and inpatients, respectively, per week, during the time frames of interest, across the years. RESULTS: Prior to lockdown, in 2020, 63.1 (SD 12.6) outpatients per week attended the Fracture Clinic, similar to previous years (p value 0.338). During lockdown, 26.0 (SD 7.3) outpatients per week attended the Fracture Clinic, fewer than previous years (p value < 0.001); similar findings were observed in both sexes and age groups (all p values < 0.001). During lockdown, 16.1 (SD 5.6) inpatients per week were admitted for hip fracture, similar to previous years (p value 0.776). CONCLUSION: During lockdown, fewer outpatients attended the Fracture Clinic, for non-hip fragility fractures, while no change in inpatient admissions for hip fracture was observed. This could reflect fewer non-hip fractures and may inform allocation of resources during pandemic.

685671,Drug treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China.,2020-06-27,"Viruses are known for their ability to alter host gene expression. Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus has two proteins that obstruct host gene expression. KSHV SOX, encoded by the open reading frame 37 (ORF37), induces a widespread cytoplasmic mRNA degradation and a block on mRNA nuclear export. The other KSHV protein, encoded by the open reading frame 10 (ORF10), was recently identified to inhibit host gene expression through its direct function on the cellular mRNA export pathway. In this review, we summarize the studies on both SOX and ORF10 in efforts to elucidate their mechanisms. We also discuss how the findings based on a closely related rodent virus, murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68), complement the KSHV findings to decipher the role of these two proteins in viral pathogenesis.","Pardamean, Carissa Ikka; Wu, Ting-Ting",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898329/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.648055,209

We posit that the emergence of multiantibiotic-resistant strains will jeopardize current treatments in these regions. Deaths arising from secondary infections are more often associated with acute lung injury, a common consequence of hypercytokinemia, than with the infection per se. Given that secondary bacterial pneumonia often has a poor prognosis, newer approaches to improve treatment outcomes are urgently needed to reduce the high levels of morbidity and mortality. Using a sequential dual-infection mouse model of secondary bacterial lung infection, we show that host-directed therapy via immunoneutralization of the angiopoietin-like 4 c-isoform (cANGPTL4) reduced pulmonary edema and damage in infected mice. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that anti-cANGPTL4 treatment improved immune and coagulation functions and reduced internal bleeding and edema. Importantly, anti-cANGPTL4 antibody, when used concurrently with either conventional antibiotics or antipneumolysin antibody, prolonged the median survival of mice compared to monotherapy. Anti-cANGPTL4 treatment enhanced immune cell phagocytosis of bacteria while restricting excessive inflammation. This modification of immune responses improved the disease outcomes of secondary pneumococcal pneumonia. Taken together, our study emphasizes that host-directed therapeutic strategies are viable adjuncts to standard antimicrobial treatments.","Li, Liang; Foo, Benjamin Jie Wei; Kwok, Ka Wai; Sakamoto, Noriho; Mukae, Hiroshi; Izumikawa, Koichi; Mandard, Stéphane; Quenot, Jean-Pierre; Lagrost, Laurent; Teh, Wooi Keong; Singh Kohli, Gurjeet; Zhu, Pengcheng; Choi, Hyungwon; Buist, Martin Lindsay; Seet, Ju Ee; Yang, Liang; He, Fang; Kwong Chow, Vincent Tak; Tan, Nguan Soon",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31164474/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02469-18,209

The World Health Organization estimates that in Africa over 5 million people would need hospital admission during the course of the pandemic. Interventions to prevent the disease include social distancing and nationwide lockdowns, which, whilst necessary, have had negative effects not only on the economic status of many but also on primary care and especially the management of chronic illnesses. There are opportunities for primary care physicians to continue learning, lend humanitarian aid and provide the needed care in this context.

The experience of incarceration intensifies financial hardship, including through worsening debt. Little is known about how people who are incarcerated and their families are impacted by debt and how it affects their reentry experience. We conducted a scoping review to identify what is known about the debt burden on those who have been incarcerated and their families and how this impacts their lives. We searched 14 data bases from 1990 to 2019 for all original research addressing financial debt held by those incarcerated in the United States, and screened articles for relevance and extracted data from pertinent studies. These 31 studies selected for inclusion showed that this population is heavily burdened by debt that was accumulated in three general categories: debt directly from criminal justice involvement such as LFOs, preexisting debt that compounded during incarceration, and debts accrued during reentry for everyday survival. Debt was generally shown to have a negative effect on financial well-being, reentry, family structure, and mental health. Debts from LFOs and child support is very common among the justice-involved population and are largely unpayable. Other forms of debt likely to burden this population remain largely understudied. Extensive reform is necessary to lessen the burden of debt on the criminal justice population in order to improve reentry outcomes and quality of life.","Harper, Annie; Ginapp, Callie; Bardelli, Tommaso; Grimshaw, Alyssa; Justen, Marissa; Mohamedali, Alaa; Thomas, Isaiah; Puglisi, Lisa",Am J Crim Justice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837173/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12103-020-09559-9,209

689220,Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 on Cardiac Arrhythmia Care: Experience of a Spanish Tertiary Hospital During the Health Crisis Triggered by the First Wave of the Pandemic,2021-09-15,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the outcome of periodontal parameters in mobile mandibular incisors which were splinted before or after full-mouth disinfection (FMD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four periodontitis patients with ≥ 1 mobile mandibular incisor (mobility degree II/III, clinical attachment loss (CAL) ≥ 5 mm, relative bone loss ≥ 50%) were randomly allocated to group A or B. Patients received periodontal treatment (PT) including splinting of teeth 33–43 before (A) or after FMD (B). Patient (age/sex/smoking status/systemic diseases/number of teeth) and tooth-related parameters (mean probing pocket depth (PPD)/CAL/oral hygiene indices; for the overall dentition and region 33–43) were assessed prior to PT and 12 months after FMD by a blinded examiner. Therapy-related information was added (group/antibiotic therapy/surgical intervention). RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (A: 12; B:14) were re-examined. Two patients of group B did not need splinting after FMD because of reduction in mobility after FMD. Regression analysis revealed a positive association of antibiotic therapy with CAL_overall, PPD_overall, and PPD_33-43 (p ≤ 0.01). There is a trend toward a higher reduction of periodontal parameters at teeth 33–43 in group A (PPD_33-43: − 0.91 vs. − 0.27 mm; CAL_33-43: − 1.02 vs. − 0.47 mm). CONCLUSIONS: Teeth splinted before or after FMD show a significant improvement in periodontal parameters 12 months after FMD. Splinting after FMD offered the option to detect reduction in mobility. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Despite a higher, but not statistically significant, improvement in periodontal parameters on teeth splinted before FMD, the results do not indicate which timepoint of splinting is more beneficial. The decision for the therapeutic procedure should therefore be made individually.","Sonnenschein, Sarah K.; Ciardo, Antonio; Kilian, Samuel; Ziegler, Philipp; Ruetters, Maurice; Splindler, Marcia; Kim, Ti-Sun",Clin Oral Investig,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34309736/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00784-021-04075-4,209
689511,Paired nasopharyngeal and deep lung testing for SARS-CoV2 reveals a viral gradient in critically ill patients: a multi-centre study,2020-10-15,"Summary The effect of different routes of immunization with either live or killed bovine rotavirus (BRV) on the production of lactogenic antibody response in mice was evaluated. The routes of immunization were intramuscular (IM), oral (O) or intradermal in the mammary region (IMam). Following immunization, serum antibody responses were monitored by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Following whelping, the mice were allowed to stay with their mother until sacrificed on alternate days post-parturition from day 1–11. Milk from their stomach was collected for antibody titration by ELISA and virus neutralization test. Regardless of the routes of immunization, a rapid increase in serum anti-rotavirus antibody titers was observed for the first 5 wk after immunization followed by a gradual decline. After parturition, the mean antibody titer of lacteal secretions, as determined by ELISA, increased gradually for 7 days with the greatest increase on day 9, followed by a decrease in anti-rotavirus antibody. These titers also correlated with antibody titers in milk as measured by virus neutralization test. The best lactogenic antibody response was observed when IMam × IM × 2 route of immunization was used with live BRV as the antigen. Interestingly, immunization via the oral route with killed BRV also resulted in good antibody responses. In contrast, in the group where killed BRV was used, animals receiving 3× orally had the highest antibody titer. The distribution of different antibody subtypes in milk samples revealed IgG to be the predominant antibody followed by IgM and IgA. Irrespective of the route of administration, there was an increase in IgA on day 9 as compared to day 1 in most of the groups. The significant role played by mucosal immunity in passive protection and the possible ways to modulate subtype specific lactogenic immune response are discussed.

Thus far, the literature has not detailed the experience of stress testing in this patient population. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients that recovered from COVID-19-related hospitalizations and underwent SPECT MPI studies at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Medical Center. RESULTS: 15 patients (median age 60 years, 67% male) were identified with COVID-19-related hospitalization and then underwent SPECT MPI imaging after recovery. During COVID-19-related hospitalization (median length of stay 8 days), patients received various COVID-19 therapies; 3 required mechanical ventilation. Stress tests (4 Exercise, 11 Pharmacologic) were performed 65 days (interquartile range 31-94 days) after the diagnosis of COVID-19. None of the patients experienced serious adverse events during or after stress testing. One patient required regadenoson reversal using aminophylline due to chest pain. CONCLUSION: Over time, more patients that recover from COVID-19 infection will require MPI testing for myocardial ischemia evaluation. Our study provides some information regarding performing stress testing in patients who have recently recovered from COVID-19 infections requiring hospitalization. Further studies are recommended to establish formal protocols for testing in this cohort.
