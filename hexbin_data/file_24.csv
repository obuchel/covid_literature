25,25,25,The role of mast cells in the pathogenesis of pain in chronic pancreatitis,17.035688,7.6909103,2005-03-03,BACKGROUND: The biological basis of pain in chronic pancreatitis is poorly understood. Mast cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pain in other conditions. We hypothesized that mast cells play a role in the pain of chronic pancreatitis. We examined the association of pain with mast cells in autopsy specimens of patients with painful chronic pancreatitis. We explored our hypothesis further using an experimental model of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) -induced chronic pancreatitis in both wild type (WT) and mast cell deficient mice (MCDM). METHODS: Archival tissues with histological diagnoses of chronic pancreatitis were identified and clinical records reviewed for presence or absence of reported pain in humans. Mast cells were counted. The presence of pain was assessed using von Frey Filaments (VFF) to measure abdominal withdrawal responses in both WT and MCDM mice with and without chronic pancreatitis. RESULTS: Humans with painful chronic pancreatitis demonstrated a 3.5-fold increase in pancreatic mast cells as compared with those with painless chronic pancreatitis. WT mice with chronic pancreatitis were significantly more sensitive as assessed by VFF pain testing of the abdomen when compared with MCDM. CONCLUSION: Humans with painful chronic pancreatitis have an increased number of pancreatic mast cells as compared with those with painless chronic pancreatitis. MCDM are less sensitive to mechanical stimulation of the abdomen after induction of chronic pancreatitis as compared with WT. Mast cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of pain in chronic pancreatitis.,"Hoogerwerf, Willemijntje A; Gondesen, Kelly; Xiao, Shu-Yuan; Winston, John H; Willis, William D; Pasricha, Pankaj J",BMC Gastroenterol,24,1
1401,1401,1401,What makes the hospitalisation system more efficient? An application of the decomposition method to Hong Kong morbidity data,16.750116,7.516563,2014-03-06,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficiency of the Hong Kong hospitalisation system based on hospitalisation days. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Hospitalisation data (2000–2010) for all government-funded hospitals in Hong Kong. POPULATION: Hospitalisation data for the entire Hong Kong population (7.0 million in 2011). METHODS: A decomposition method was used to determine the effects on total hospitalisation days during the period 2000–2010 of the following three factors: (i) hospitalisation rate per person; (ii) the number of visits per patient; and (iii) the mean duration of stay per visit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The decomposition method provides empirical measures of how the three factors contributed to the change in total hospitalisation days during the period 2000–2010 and identifies the most effective way to contain increases in hospitalisation days. RESULTS: The results of decomposition analysis show that the decrease in mean duration of stay per visit (reducing from 6.83 to 4.58 days) is the most important factor in the reduction in the total number of hospitalisation days, despite increases in total population size (from 6.7 to 7.0 million), the number of individual hospital admissions (from 583 000 to 664 000) and the number of episodes (from 1.2 to 1.4 million) from 2000 to 2010. Hospitalisation days per person decreased from 1.18 in 2000 to 0.93 in 2010. The decline in the mean duration of stay per visit contributed 200.6% to this reduction but was offset by −51.1% due to a slight growth in the number of visits per patient and by −49.4% as a result of changed hospitalisation rates per person. CONCLUSIONS: Better management of the duration of stay of per visit without compromising patient satisfaction levels or the quality of service is the most important factor for controlling increases in health expenditure in Hong Kong.","Yip, Paul S F; Lee, Carmen K M; Chow, Chun-Bong; Lo, William T L",BMJ Open,24,1
2879,2879,2879,Effectiveness of a fluid chart in outpatient management of suspected dengue fever: A pilot study,16.736889,7.717211,2017-10-04,"INTRODUCTION: Dengue infection is the fastest spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world. One of the complications of dengue is dehydration which, if not carefully monitored and treated, may lead to shock, particularly in those with dengue haemorrhagic fever. WHO has recommended oral fluid intake of five glasses or more for adults who are suspected to have dengue fever. However, there have been no published studies looking at self-care intervention measures to improve oral fluid intake among patients suspected of dengue fever. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using a fluid chart to improve oral fluid intake in patients with suspected dengue fever in a primary care setting. METHODS: This feasibility study used a randomized controlled study design. The data was collected over two months at a primary care clinic in a teaching hospital. The inclusion criteria were: age > 12 years, patients who were suspected to have dengue fever based on the assessment by the primary healthcare clinician, fever for > three days, and thrombocytopenia (platelets < 150 x 10(9)/L). Both groups received a dengue home care card. The intervention group received the fluid chart and a cup (200ml). Baseline clinical and laboratory data, 24-hour fluid recall (control group), and fluid chart were collected. The main outcomes were: hospitalization rates, intravenous fluid requirement and total oral fluid intake. FINDINGS: Among the 138 participants who were included in the final analysis, there were fewer hospital admissions in the intervention group (n = 7, 10.0%) than the control group (n = 12, 17.6%) (p = 0.192). Similarly, fewer patients (n = 9, 12.9%) in the intervention group required intravenous fluid compared to the control group (n = 15, 22.1%), (p = 0.154). There was an increase in the amount of daily oral fluid intake in the intervention group (about 3,000 ml) compared to the control group (about 2,500 ml, p = 0.521). However, these differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: This is a feasible and acceptable study to perform in a primary care setting. The fluid chart is a simple, inexpensive tool that may reduce hospitalization and intravenous fluid requirement in suspected dengue patients. A randomized controlled trial with larger sample size is needed to determine this conclusively.

3800,3800,3800,Human metapneumovirus in Pediatric Patients with Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in the Aseer Region of Saudi Arabia,16.876858,7.416303,2019-04-12,"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a Paramyxovirus known to cause acute respiratory tract infections in children and young adults. To date, there is no study from the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia determining the proportion and severity of hMPV infection among pediatric hospitalized patients with respiratory infections. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to determine the presence of hMPV antigens in the nasopharyngeal secretions of pediatric patients hospitalized with respiratory tract infections in the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, serological hospital-based study included all pediatric patients who were admitted to Aseer Central Hospital, Abha, Saudi Arabia, from July 2016 to November 2017 with upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections. Basic demographics of patients and their clinical data on and after admission were recorded. Direct fluorescent antibody assay was used to detect the presence of hMPV antigens in the obtained nasopharyngeal secretion specimens. RESULTS: During the study, 91 pediatric patients were hospitalized due to upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections, of which 9.9% were positive for hMPV. These patients were aged 9 months to 16 years, were from Abha city or its surrounding localities and were mostly (77.8%) hospitalized during autumn or winter. The most common diagnosis on admission was bronchopneumonia (55.5%) and aspiration pneumonia (22.2%), and some patients also had underlying chronic conditions such as chronic heart disease (22.2%) and bronchial asthma (11.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained indicated that hMPV is a potential etiologic factor for the commonly occurring acute respiratory infections in hospitalized children from the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia. hMPV infection was also found to be associated with complicated respiratory conditions such as bronchopneumonia, chronic heart disease and bronchial asthma.","Alsuheel, Ali Mohammed; Ali, Abdelwahid Saeed; Al-Hakami, Ahmed Musa; Shati, Ayed Abdullah; Chandramoorthy, Harish C.; Al-Qahtani, Saleh Mohammed",Saudi J Med Med Sci,24,22
4127,4127,4127,"Using Non-Invasive Monitoring Technologies to Capture Behavioural, Physiological and Health Responses of Dairy Calves to Different Nutritional Regimes during the First Ten Weeks of Life",16.88171,7.6828575,2019-10-02,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Recent research has debated the effects of milk and forage feeding regimes in the first weeks of life on the future performance of dairy calves. However, little is known about how feeding regime can affect behavioural and physiological responses, which have the potential to impact on calf health and well-being. Traditional methods of assessing calf health and welfare such as behavioural observations and blood sampling can be time consuming and impractical for producers and invasive for animals involved. Developments in technology have increased the availability of on-farm non-invasive devices which allow automatic and remote collection of behavioural and physiological data linked to animal health and welfare. This study aimed to use devices to measure lying behaviour, heart rate, heart rate variability and infrared temperature of calves offered high or low levels of milk replacer and different types of forage throughout the first ten weeks of life. Calves displayed changes in lying behaviour and heart rate variability as a result of changes in milk replacer feeding frequency. Additionally, infrared temperature changes were detected during periods of vaccination which corresponded with a rise in core body temperature. Results have highlighted that these sensors can provide important and useable data regarding overall calf well-being on commercial farms. ABSTRACT: This study aimed to examine the use of non-invasive monitoring technologies as a means of capturing behavioural, physiological and health responses of calves allocated to different nutritional regimes. Seventy-four Holstein Friesian calves were individually penned and allocated to receive either high (HML) or conventional (CML) milk replacer (MR) levels between 5–70 days of age. Additionally calves were allocated to one of four forage treatments: (i) chopped straw offered between 14–70 days of age (CS14), (ii) chopped straw offered between 56–70 days of age (CS56), (iii) grass silage offered between 56–70 days of age (GS56), and (iv) no forage in the pre-wean period (NF). A representative sample of calves from each treatment were fitted with activity sensors and heart rate monitors throughout the experimental period to examine lying behaviour and heart rate variability, respectively. Thermal images of the eye and rectal area of each calf were taken 5 days/week between 5–77 days of age. Faecal and respiratory scoring of each individual calf was carried out on a daily basis throughout the experimental period. Milk replacer feeding level had limited effects on measures of calf health, although HML calves tended to have an increased likelihood for receiving treatment for scour than CML calves. Daily lying time (min/d) was lower in HML calves following reduction in MR feeding frequency at 43 days of age and weaning at 71 days of age when compared with CML calves. Additionally, HML calves displayed a lower heart rate variability following weaning, this suggestive of increased stress load. There were limited effects of forage treatment, however, CS14 calves displayed a greater daily lying time following MR step-down at 68 days of age, this potentially indicating increased rumination. Results of the present study highlight the benefits of using remote monitoring technologies as a means of detecting behavioural and physiological changes as a result of nutritional management strategy in individually housed dairy calves.","Scoley, Gillian; Gordon, Alan; Morrison, Steven",Animals (Basel),24,5

Among cases of TIBOLA, a case of scalp eschar and neck lymphadenopathy after tick bite (SENLAT) is diagnosed when an eschar is present on the scalp, accompanied by peripheral lymphadenopathy (LAP). Only a few cases of SENLAT caused by Bartonella henselae have been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old male sought medical advice while suffering from high fever and diarrhea. Three weeks before the visit, he had been hunting a water deer, and upon bringing the deer home discovered a tick on his scalp area. Symptoms occurred one week after hunting, and a lump was palpated on the right neck area 6 days after the onset of symptoms. Physical examination upon presentation confirmed an eschar-like lesion on the right scalp area, and cervical palpation revealed that the lymph nodes on the right side were non-painful and enlarged at 2.5 × 1.5 cm. Fine needle aspiration of the enlarged lymph nodes was performed, and results of nested PCR for the Bartonella internal transcribed spacer (ITS) confirmed B. henselae as the causative agent. CONCLUSION: With an isolated case of SENLAT and a confirmation of B. henselae in Korea, it is pertinent to raise awareness to physicians in other Asian countries that B. henselae could be a causative agent for SENLAT.","Seo, Jun-Won; Kim, Choon-Mee; Yun, Na Ra; Kim, Dong-Min; Kim, Sung Soon; Choi, Sangho; Chu, Hyuk",BMC Infect Dis,24,31

We hypothesized that mortality shows a variability associated with country after adjustment for clinical characteristics and management. METHODS: Analysis of four studies carried out at 6-year intervals over an 18-year period. The studies included 26,024 patients (5183 in 1998, 4968 in 2004, 8108 in 2010, and 7765 in 2016) admitted to 1253 units from 38 countries. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. We performed analyses using multilevel logistic modeling with mixed-random effects, including country as a random variable. To evaluate the effect of management strategies on mortality, a mediation analysis was performed. RESULTS: Adjusted 28-day mortality decreased significantly over time (first study as reference): 2004: odds ratio 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–0.93); 2010: 0.63 (95% CI 0.53–0.75); 2016: 0.49 (95% CI 0.39–0.61). A protective ventilatory strategy and the use of continuous sedation mediated a moderate fraction of the effect of time on mortality in patients with moderate hypoxemia and without hypoxemia, respectively. Logistic multilevel modeling showed a significant effect of country on mortality: median odds ratio (MOR) in 1998: 2.02 (95% CI 1.57–2.48); in 2004: 1.76 (95% CI 1.47–2.06); in 2010: 1.55 (95% CI 1.37–1.74), and in 2016: 1.39 (95% CI 1.25–1.54). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that country could contribute, independently of confounder variables, to outcome. The magnitude of the effect of country decreased over time.

After approval by the human ethical committee of the Gunma Children’s Medical Center (GCMC) and informed consent of the parents, 40 consecutive term congenital heart disease patients aged until 1 year who underwent long CPB time (> 3 h) at surgery were included in the prospective study between January 2012 and December 2014. C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-inh) drug (@Berinert) was generously provided by CSL Behring (King of Prussia, PA). The C1-inh (20 IU/kg) was given intravenously 60 min after CPB. Blood samples for complement factors were obtained before and 48 h after administration of C1-inh. Six patients did not survive and their data were not included. Of 34 patients included, median age was 6.5 months, median body weight was 6050 g, and 16 (47%) were female. According to the Mann–Whitney U test, there were no differences between the two groups concerning demographic and intraoperative data, postoperative chemical data. C1q concentration was only significant lower in patients with C1-inh non-treated group than in patients with C1-inh treated group. But, the consumption of C1q, C3, C4, CH(50), and C1-inh in patients with C1-inhibitor non-treated group was observed early postoperatively. There is a significant difference in the values before and after C1-inh treatment between the two groups. The lower value in the C1-inh-treated group is explained by the activation of the classical pathway through the replenishment of complements by C1-inh treatment. This study proposes the administration of C1-inh is an effective therapy to reduce the activation and improve the clinical capillary leak syndrome.","Miyamoto, Takashi; Ozaki, Shinichi; Inui, Akitoshi; Tanaka, Yuki; Yamada, Yoshiyuki; Matsumoto, Naoki",Heart Vessels,24,1

In the context of day-to-day practice, clinical and preclinical studies, clinicians and basic researchers team up and continuously strive to increase insights into lung disease progression, diagnostic and treatment options. To unravel disease processes and to test novel therapeutic approaches, investigators typically rely on end-stage procedures such as serum analysis, cyto-/chemokine profiles and selective tissue histology from animal models. These techniques are useful but provide only a snapshot of disease processes that are essentially dynamic in time and space. Technology allowing evaluation of live animals repeatedly is indispensable to gain a better insight into the dynamics of lung disease progression and treatment effects. Computed tomography (CT) is a clinical diagnostic imaging technique that can have enormous benefits in a research context too. Yet, the implementation of imaging techniques in laboratories lags behind. In this review we want to showcase the integrated approaches and novel developments in imaging, lung functional testing and pathological techniques that are used to assess, diagnose, quantify and treat lung disease and that may be employed in research on patients and animals. Imaging approaches result in often novel anatomical and functional biomarkers, resulting in many advantages, such as better insight in disease progression and a reduction in the numbers of animals necessary. We here showcase integrated assessment of lung disease with imaging and histopathological technologies, applied to the example of lung fibrosis. Better integration of clinical and preclinical imaging technologies with pathology will ultimately result in improved clinical translation of (therapy) study results.","Tielemans, Birger; Dekoster, Kaat; Verleden, Stijn E.; Sawall, Stefan; Leszczyński, Bartosz; Laperre, Kjell; Vanstapel, Arno; Verschakelen, Johny; Kachelriess, Marc; Verbeken, Erik; Swoger, Jim; Vande Velde, Greetje",Diagnostics (Basel),24,1

Achromopeptidase (ACP) is a well-known enzyme that hydrolyzes a number of proteins, notably proteins on the surface of Gram-positive bacteria. It is therefore used for sample preparation in nucleic acid tests. However, ACP inhibits DNA amplification which makes its integration difficult. Heat is commonly used to inactivate ACP, but it can be challenging to integrate heating into point-of-care devices. Here, we use recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) together with ACP, and show that when ACP is immobilized on nitrocellulose paper, it retains its enzymatic function and can easily and rapidly be activated using agitation. The nitrocellulose-bound ACP does, however, not leak into the solution, preventing the need for deactivation through heat or by other means. Nitrocellulose-bound ACP thus opens new possibilities for paper-based Point-of-Care (POC) devices.","Chondrogiannis, Georgios; Khaliliazar, Shirin; Toldrà, Anna; Réu, Pedro; Hamedi, Mahiar M.",Sci Rep,24,1

Although most Montana residents (60%, n = 194) planned to get their REAL IDs within the first year that it became available, 43% (n = 141) of respondents to a survey of registered voters (n = 325) intended to wait more than one year or never obtain it. Individuals who planned to wait were more likely to report concerns about government collection of personal data, and view the law as an invasion of privacy. However, the relationship is weak. As one of several states that opposed adoption of the Real ID Act in, Montana was characterized in academic and lay media as basing its opposition on concerns about violations of privacy. State officials were so concerned that residents would object to the imposition of the new ID, that REAL ID campaign organizers were directed to only raise awareness, and avoid any efforts at persuasion. Focus groups conducted to assess responses to several campaign strategies indicated an approach that described REAL ID as consistent with traditional Montana values of independence, but did not confront privacy concerns. This paper uses quantitative and qualitative data in an attempt to understand how strong such resistance in Montana actually was.","Keller, Sarah N.; Wilkinson, Timothy J.; Otjen, A.

However, it is not clear which of Chinese herbs are critical for the treatment of HCC. Besides, mechanisms of CCHs in the treatment of HCC remain unclear. Hence, our goal is to identify the core Chinese herbs (CCHs) for treating HCC and explore their antitumor mechanism. METHODS: Firstly, clinical traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescriptions for HCC were collected from Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, and then, data mining software was used to identify CCHs. After that, bioactive compounds and corresponding target genes of CCHs were obtained using three TCM databases, and target genes of HCC were acquired from MalaCards and OMIM. Subsequently, common target genes of CCHs and HCC were screened. Moreover, biological functions and pathways were analyzed, and Cytoscape plugin cytoHubba was used to identify hub genes. Finally, prognostic values of hub genes were verified by survival analysis, and the molecular docking approach was utilized to validate the interactions between targets and bioactive compounds of CCHs. RESULTS: Eight CCHs were determined from 630 prescriptions, and 100 bioactive compounds (e.g., quercetin and luteolin) and 126 common target genes were screened. Furthermore, common target genes of CCHs and HCC were mainly enriched in cancer-associated pathways, and six hub genes with statistical significance in survival analysis were selected as key target genes for molecular docking. Additionally, molecular docking showed that the bioactive compounds docked well with the protein receptors of key target genes. CONCLUSION: By combining data mining, network pharmacology, molecular docking, and survival analysis methods, we found that CCHs may play a therapeutic role in HCC through regulating the target genes and pathways related to cancer occurrence and development, angiogenesis, metastasis, and prognosis.","Wu, Zhulin; He, Li; Wang, Lianan; Peng, Lisheng",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,24,20

The standard of care for treating opioid use disorder during pregnancy includes medications for opioid disorder (MOUD). However, tobacco use often goes unaddressed among pregnant women on MOUD. In 2018, our team received a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) funded R34 to conduct a three year-randomized trial to test the feasibility of a novel tobacco intervention for pregnant women receiving MOUD. AIMS: The aims of this study are: (1) to determine the impact of the B-EPIC intervention on maternal tobacco use and stage of change; (2) to determine the impact of B-EPIC on tobacco-related maternal and infant health outcomes including gestational age at birth, birthweight, NAS diagnosis and severity, and number of ear and respiratory infections during the first six months; (3) to compare healthcare utilization and costs incurred by pregnant patients that receive the B-EPIC intervention versus TAU. METHODS: We plan to enroll 100 pregnant women on MOUD for this randomized controlled trial (B-EPIC intervention n = 50 and treatment as usual n = 50). A major strength of this study is its wide range of health and economic outcomes assessed on mother, neonate and the infant. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the very high rates of smoking among pregnant women with OUD, there are few tobacco treatment interventions that have been tailored for this high - risk population. The overall goal of this study is to move towards a tobacco treatment standard for pregnant women receiving treatment for OUD.","Fallin-Bennett, Amanda; Lofwall, Michelle; Waters, Teresa; Nuzzo, Paul; Barnett, Janine; Ducas, Letitia; McCubbin, Andrea; Chavan, Niraj; Blair, Lisa; Ashford, Kristin",Contemp Clin Trials Commun,24,10

Tele-health is a relatively new, and yet fundamental amid the current crisis, resource to bridge the gap between phisicians and patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report our experience with telemedicine and describe the major events occured in our patients. 121 consecutive adult patients with arterial hypertension (F/M: 56/65; mean age: 66.8 years) were enrolled. 33 patients (27%) had also diabetes, 94 (78%) were also affected from dyslipidemia and 11 (9%) had CAD. They all referred to our ambulatory of hypertension, in most of case for several years. Given the impossibility to continue routine outpatient visits during lockdown, they were all phone called by three residents in order to detect their state of health or any events they could have experienced over this period. They were all asked about their own blood pressure values, the occurrence of new symptoms and of new-onset both cardiovascular and non cardiovascular events. We also followed a self-made preset form. 31 of them (26%) experienced cardiovascular symptoms/events during this period: 11 had hypertensive peaks, in one case associated with nausea and vomiting while 2 of them had hypotensive episodes; 10 had typical angina and/or dyspnoea while 4 had atypical angina; 6 had palpitations; 1 of them developed new onset atrial fibrillation resolved with pharmacologic cardioversion during hospitalization; 1 had syncope; 1 patient reported new onset peripheral oedema; 2 patients died during lockdown for non cardiovascular causes. 17 of them also developed non cardiovascular symptoms, 7 of whom were severe anxiety and/or panic attacks. Almost all patients had important lifestyle changes, in 15 cases (12.3%) associated with weight increase. CONCLUSION: The impossibility to access to routine outpatient visits during lockdown due to global pandemic of SARS-CoV2, has brought out the risk of underestimating consequences of chronic disease, in absence of appropriate Follow-up. Nevertheless, the two deaths we report were not related to cardiovascular disease. The risk is that both the missing of cardiovascular control visit and the extension of the waiting list, could provoke serious complications in patients suffering from chronic cardiovascular disease.","Fedele, Teresa; Orefice, Silvia; Fiorillo, Ludovica; Cuomo, Vittoria; Capone, Valentina; Casciano, Ofelia; Luciano, Federica; Canonico, Mario Enrico; Santoro, Ciro; Esposito, Roberta",Eur Heart J Suppl,24,1

In the present investigation, we screened 80 in-house quinoline derivatives for their anti-CHIKV activity by computational techniques and found 4-hydroxy-1-methyl-3-(3-morpholinopropanoyl)quinoline-2(1H)-one (QVIR) to have potential binding affinities with CHIKV nsP2 and E2 glycoproteins. QVIR was evaluated in vitro for its anti-CHIKV potential. QVIR showed strong inhibition of CHIKV infection with an EC(50) (50% effective concentration) value of 2.2 ± 0.49 μM without significant cytotoxicity (CC(50) > 200 μM) and was chosen for further elucidation of its antiviral mechanism. The infectious viral particle formation was abolished by approximately 72% at a QVIR concentration of 20 μM during infection in the BHK-21 cell line, and the CHIKV RNA synthesis was diminished by 84% for nsP2 as well as 74% for E2, whereas the levels of viral proteins were decreased by 69.9% for nsP2 and 53.9% for E2. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed a huge decline in the expression of viral nsP2 and E2 proteins by 71.84 and 67.7%, respectively. Time of addition experiments indicated that QVIR inhibited viral infection at early and late stages of viral replication cycle, and the optimal inhibition was observed at 16 h post infection. The present study advocates for the first time that QVIR acts as a substantial and potent inhibitor against CHIKV and might be as an auspicious novel drug candidate for the development of therapeutic agents against CHIKV infections.","Islamuddin, Mohammad; Afzal, Obaid; Khan, Wajihul Hasan; Hisamuddin, Malik; Altamimi, Abdulmalik Saleh Alfawaz; Husain, Ibraheem; Kato, Kentaro; Alamri, Mubarak A.; Parveen, Shama",ACS Omega,24,1

However, learning analytics is part of a young community and its developments deserve further exploration. Some critical stances claim that learning analytics tends to underplay the complexity of teaching-learning processes. By means of both a bibliometric and a content analysis, this paper examines the publication patterns on learning analytics in higher education and their main challenges. 385 papers that were published in WoScc and SciELO indexes between 2013 and 2019 were identified and analysed. Learning analytics is a vibrant and fast-developing community. However, it continues to face multiple and complex challenges, especially regarding students’ learning and their implications. The paper concludes by distinguishing between a practice-based and management-oriented community of learning analytics and an academic-oriented community. Within both communities, though, it seems that the focus is more on analytics than on learning.

B cells are key players in this relationship because activated and differentiated B cells produce secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), which binds commensals to preserve a healthy microbial ecosystem. Mounting evidence shows that changes in the function and composition of the gut microbiota are associated with several autoimmune diseases suggesting that an imbalanced or dysbiotic microbiota contributes to autoimmune inflammation. Bacteria within the gut mucosa may modulate autoimmune inflammation through different mechanisms from commensals ability to induce B-cell clones that cross-react with host antigens or through regulation of B-cell subsets’ capacity to produce cytokines. Commensal signals in the gut instigate the differentiation of IL-10 producing B cells and IL-10 producing IgA+ plasma cells that recirculate and exert regulatory functions. While the origin of the dysbiosis in autoimmunity is unclear, compelling evidence shows that specific species have a remarkable influence in shaping the inflammatory immune response. Further insight is necessary to dissect the complex interaction between microorganisms, genes, and the immune system. In this review, we will discuss the bidirectional interaction between commensals and B-cell responses in the context of autoimmune inflammation.","Botía-Sánchez, María; Alarcón-Riquelme, Marta E.; Galicia, Georgina",Int J Mol Sci,24,16

The study uses primary data collected from 175 Indian high-tech start-ups that are headquartered across the country, using a semi-structured questionnaire and in-depth interviews with the top-level management of the sample firms for analysis. Among the firm-related factors, sales and R&D capabilities of the start-ups have shown to be of paramount importance in influencing the competitiveness of high-tech start-ups. Further, among the external environment-specific attributes, the SDP growth in the region is shown to have significant influence on the competitiveness of high-tech start-ups (borderline significant). This paper makes a key contribution to the existing literature by empirically identifying the key entrepreneur-specific, firm-specific and external environment-specific factors of a firm that influence the competitiveness of high-tech start-ups that are in pre-growth stage in a developing economy. The findings of the study will help start-up owners and policy-makers to make adjustments in their policy-making and strategy to enhance the competitiveness of the technology-based startups operating in India.

With the COVID-19 pandemic threatening human lives and livelihoods, concerns are raised about the preparedness and readiness of health policies and systems in African countries to deal with these kinds of health calamities. More particularly, questions can be asked about the preparedness or even existence of mental health policies and associated systems to help individuals and communities in Africa to deal with the consequences of COVID-19 and other health emergencies. In this article, we analyse the existing mental health policies of four African countries paying attention to the capacity of these legislative provisions to enable psychology professionals to deal with psychosocial problems brought about by COVID-19. We use Walt and Gilson’s Policy Triangle Framework to frame our analysis of the existing mental health policies. In line with this conceptual framework, we review the role played by the different factors in shaping and influencing these mental health policies. We further explore the challenges and opportunities associated with existing legislation and mental health policies. We also reflect on the reports obtained from each of the four countries about the role that psychologists are playing to deal with the associated psychosocial problems. Based on our policy analysis and country reports, we highlight strengths and gaps in these policies and give recommendations on how mental health policies in these countries can be strengthened to respond to COVID-19 and future health emergencies.","Sodi, Tholene; Modipane, Mahlatse; Oppong Asante, Kwaku; Quarshie, Emmanuel Nii-Boye; Asatsa, Stephen; Mutambara, Julia; Khombo, Sibusiso",S Afr J Psychol,24,1

Discrete-time mathematical models are commonly used for describing the dynamical properties of phytoplankton and zooplankton interaction with nonoverlapping generations. In such type of generations a new age group swaps the older group after regular intervals of time. Keeping in observation the dynamical reliability for continuous-time mathematical models, we convert a continuous-time phytoplankton–zooplankton model into its discrete-time counterpart by applying a dynamically consistent nonstandard difference scheme. Moreover, we discuss boundedness conditions for every solution and prove the existence of a unique positive equilibrium point. We discuss the local stability of obtained system about all its equilibrium points and show the existence of Neimark–Sacker bifurcation about unique positive equilibrium under some mathematical conditions. To control the Neimark–Sacker bifurcation, we apply a generalized hybrid control technique. For explanation of our theoretical results and to compare the dynamics of obtained discrete-time model with its continuous counterpart, we provide some motivating numerical examples. Moreover, from numerical study we can see that the obtained system and its continuous-time counterpart are stable for the same values of parameters, and they are unstable for the same parametric values. Hence the dynamical consistency of our obtained system can be seen from numerical study. Finally, we compare the modified hybrid method with old hybrid method at the end of the paper.","Khan, Muhammad Salman; Samreen, Maria; Aydi, Hassen; De la Sen, Manuel",Adv Differ Equ,24,26

Respondents’ mean age at baseline was 55.7 (SD = 4.7, range: 50–78). Over a year’s time, respondents had a decline in quality of life and self-rated health (p < .001), experienced more life-threatening events (p < .05) and somatic complaints. The hierarchical multiple regression model, employed in the study, identifies three predictors of future quality of life after adding the interaction term ‘Previous LTE × Previous GSE × Previous household income’ — previous quality of life (β = .492, p < .001), previous LTE (β = -.292, p < .001), and the interaction term (β = .221, p < .05). This model explains 34.1% of the variance of future quality of life (Adjusted R(2) = .341, p < .001). The findings suggests that respondents’ good self-appraisal of coping resources could moderate the impact of adversities on their future quality of life. Interventions for promoting positive psychological growth among middle-aged and older adults should cover four domains, i.e. event-related factors, environmental factors, personal factors, and cognitive and coping responses. Traditional Chinese wisdom emphasizes the importance of understanding the bad (‘Yin’—the shady side) and the good (‘Yang’—the sunny side) aspect of life events.

59141,59141,59141,Assessment of level of awareness regarding COVID-19 illness,17.09139,7.39067,2021-10-08,"BACKGROUND: Oil palm, Elaeis guineensis, is by far the most important global oil crop, supplying about 40% of all traded vegetable oil. Palm oils are key dietary components consumed daily by over three billion people, mostly in Asia, and also have a wide range of important non-food uses including in cleansing and sanitizing products. MAIN BODY: Oil palm is a perennial crop with a > 25-year life cycle and an exceptionally low land footprint compared to annual oilseed crops. Oil palm crops globally produce an annual 81 million tonnes (Mt) of oil from about 19 million hectares (Mha). In contrast, the second and third largest vegetable oil crops, soybean and rapeseed, yield a combined 84 Mt oil but occupy over 163 Mha of increasingly scarce arable land. The oil palm crop system faces many challenges in the 2020s. These include increasing incidence of new and existing pests/diseases and a general lack of climatic resilience, especially relating to elevated temperatures and increasingly erratic rainfall patterns, plus downstream issues relating to supply chains and consumer sentiment. This review surveys the oil palm sector in the 2020s and beyond, its major challenges and options for future progress. CONCLUSIONS: Oil palm crop production faces many future challenges, including emerging threats from climate change and pests and diseases. The inevitability of climate change requires more effective international collaboration for its reduction. New breeding and management approaches are providing the promise of improvements, such as much higher yielding varieties, improved oil profiles, enhanced disease resistance, and greater climatic resilience.","Murphy, Denis J.; Goggin, Kirstie; Paterson, R.

METHODS: Eighty participants (mean age 36.3) who had at least 90 consecutive days substance free self-selected into treatment (MBRP, n = 35) or comparison groups (treatment as usual, TAU, n = 45). Outcomes tracked included treatment retention and relapse, and self-reported craving, anxiety, depression, and mindfulness at baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, and 36 weeks post-recruitment. MBRP group participants attended biweekly 60-min sessions for 24 weeks. A linear mixed model analysis of variance determined the significance of the MBRP intervention on changes in craving, anxiety, depression, and mindfulness. RESULTS: No significant differences in sex, education level, insurance status, relationship status, or employment status were detected at baseline between groups. The 36-week retention (74%, MBRP/MOUD; 71%, TAU/MOUD) and relapse rates (43%, MBRP/MOUD; 47%, TAU/MOUD) were similar for the groups. There were only four relapses on opioids. Significant reductions (p < .05) were observed in the MBRP/MOUD group for craving, anxiety, and depression in addition to significant increases in mindfulness compared to those in TAU/MOUD. CONCLUSIONS: Although state and federal resources are available to expand MOUD, no standard of behavioral therapy has been established as most complimentary to MOUD. The current study results suggest MBRP can be implemented as an outpatient therapy for individuals in MOUD.","Zullig, Keith J.; Lander, Laura R.; Tuscano, Meghan; Garland, Megan; Hobbs, Gerry R.; Faulkenberry, Laurel",Mindfulness (N Y),24,1

When financially constrained, consumers prefer solitary (vs. social) purchases. We also identify self-construal as a moderator of how consumers spend their discretionary income. While independent consumers prefer solitary (vs. social) purchases, interdependent consumers prefer social (vs. solitary) purchases. Interestingly, when consumers have adequate discretionary income, independent as well as interdependent consumers have similar preferences for solitary and social purchases. In addition, for interdependent consumers, communal norms mediate the preference for social purchases. Finally, for independent consumers, making the communal norm salient reverses their preference for solitary purchases, resulting in a preference for social purchases. Our findings suggest how managers can effectively promote different types of purchases under varying financial resource conditions in their global communication strategy.

The optical design of KFISP is developed such that it can be used in various modes of operation. These are: direct imaging, spectroscopic, polarimetric imaging, and spectro-polarimetric. The KFISP is an all-refractive design to meet the polarimetric requirements and includes a focal reducer with a corrector section, collimator section, parallel beam section (containing various imaging components), and camera section. The corrector section gives an unvignetted Field-of-View of 8ʹ × 8ʹ and the collimator section has a focal length of 305 mm and matches the focal ratio of the input beam. The parallel beam section is 200 mm long and near the middle of it there is an image of the telescope pupil. The camera section includes 5 elements and has a focal length of 154.51 mm which gives an instrument effective final focal ratio of f/6.14 (acting as a telescope focal reducer of 1:2 ratio). The KFISP contains an internal calibration system which hosts the calibration light injection system, an integrating sphere equipped with the required calibration light sources. The opto-mechanical parts of KFISP contain a double-layered carbon fiber strut structure and comprises its subsystems of slit and guider assemblies, filter wheel drawer, grism wheel drawer, polarimetric components cubical box, and CCD camera which is integrated with camera optics. The CCD camera has 2048 [Formula: see text] 2048 pixels with 13.5-micron square pixel size. The camera is cooled by liquid Nitrogen and is fixed to the KFISP through the integrated camera lens. The KFISP has been fully commissioned, mounted and is being tested in all modes of operation. In this paper we introduce the ambitious scientific goals, the optical setups of KFISP, its opto-mechanical implementation and the performance analysis of the instrument.

We compared the diagnostic accuracy of a single-gland ICG score of 2 with a score estimated by adding the viability value of the four glands (4-ICG). METHODS Fifty patients (66% women, median age 49.4 years) underwent total thyroidectomy with identification of all 4 glands. The degree of ICG was classified as 0: black (nonvascularized), 1: gray/heterogeneous (partially vascularized), and 2: white (well vascularized). RESULTS The diagnostic accuracy of the optimal cut-off of the 4-ICG sum score ≤3 was 84% (95% CI: 70.9-92.8) lower than the diagnostic accuracy of 92% (80.8-97.8) of the ICG score 2. Both scores identified 2 false negative cases, but the rates of false positives were lower with the ICG score 2 (18.2 vs. 57.1%). CONCLUSIONS Identification of single-gland ICG score of 2 has a higher diagnostic accuracy than 4-ICG sum score to predict immediate hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy.","Moreno Llorente, Pablo; García Barrasa, Arantxa; Francos Martínez, José Manuel; Alberich Prats, Marta; Pascua Solé, Mireia",Cirugia espanola,24,1

Due to a national compulsive decree of quarantine, office visits for chronic disease control were delay. Hypopituitarism includes all clinical conditions that result in partial or complete failure of the pituitary gland's ability to secrete hormones. Pituitary insufficiency per se has been associated with an increase in both morbidity and mortality, particularly due to cardiovascular disease, which is an important risk factor for COVID-19 disease severity. OBJECTIVE To report the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient with hypopituitarism, discuss the implications of the treatments the patient was taking and grade up the value of telemedicine in the present scenario. METHODS Report of the clinical record of a patient with hypopituitarism and infection with SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS During the span of the infection, the patient remained on the same hormonal therapeutic scheme (thyroid, gonadal and adrenal axis). The dose of hydrocortisone was not changed during the course of the infection as she was asymptomatic. We use telemedicine to control and advise her on the treatment. CONCLUSION Health care professionals should carefully follow up on the evolution of patients with hypopituitarism to provide them a safer outcome. The use of telemedicine as a methodology for selected patients acquires relevance in the present epidemiological context.","Fux Otta, Carolina; Moreno, Laura; Vitaloni, Roberto; Iraci, Gabriel S",Revista de la Facultad de Ciencias Medicas,24,19

Encouraged by several favorable single-institution reports, we conducted a multicenter, single-arm, phase II study of SN mapping that used a standardized dual tracer endoscopic injection technique. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with previously untreated cT1 or cT2 gastric adenocarcinomas < 4 cm in gross diameter were eligible for inclusion in this study. SN mapping was performed by using a standardized dual tracer endoscopic injection technique. Following biopsy of the identified SNs, mandatory comprehensive D2 or modified D2 gastrectomy was performed according to current Japanese Gastric Cancer Association guidelines. RESULTS Among 433 patients who gave preoperative consent, 397 were deemed eligible on the basis of surgical findings. SN biopsy was performed in all patients, and the SN detection rate was 97.5% (387 of 397). Of 57 patients with lymph node metastasis by conventional hematoxylin and eosin staining, 93% (53 of 57) had positive SNs, and the accuracy of nodal evaluation for metastasis was 99% (383 of 387). Only four false-negative SN biopsies were observed, and pathologic analysis revealed that three of those biopsies were pT2 or tumors > 4 cm. We observed no serious adverse effects related to endoscopic tracer injection or the SN mapping procedure. CONCLUSION The endoscopic dual tracer method for SN biopsy was confirmed as safe and effective when applied to the superficial, relatively small gastric adenocarcinomas included in this study.","Kitagawa, Yuko; Takeuchi, Hiroya; Takagi, Yu; Natsugoe, Shoji; Terashima, Masanori; Murakami, Nozomu; Fujimura, Takashi; Tsujimoto, Hironori; Hayashi, Hideki; Yoshimizu, Nobunari; Takagane, Akinori; Mohri, Yasuhiko; Nabeshima, Kazuhito; Uenosono, Yoshikazu; Kinami, Shinichi; Sakamoto, Junichi; Morita, Satoshi; Aikou, Takashi; Miwa, Koichi; Kitajima, Masaki",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,24,1

For GSH and GSSG measurement, the sample was spiked with isotopically enriched analogues of the analytes ((310)GSH and (616)GSSG), along with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and treated with acetonitrile to solubilize the endogenous analytes via protein precipitation and equilibrate them with the spikes. The supernatant was analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the analytes were quantified with simultaneous tracking and correction for auto-oxidation of GSH to GSSG. For tGSH assay, a (310)GSH-spiked sample was treated with dithiothreitol (DTT) to convert disulfide-bonded glutathione to GSH. After removing the protein, the supernatant was analyzed by LC-MS/MS and the analyte was quantified by single-spiking isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS). The mathematical relationships in IDMS and SIDMS quantifications are based on isotopic ratios and do not involve calibration curves. The protocols were validated using spike recovery tests and by analyzing synthetic standard solutions. Red blood cell (RBC) and saliva samples obtained from healthy subjects, and whole blood samples collected and shipped from a remote location were analyzed. The concentrations of tGSH in the RBC and whole blood samples were 2 orders of magnitude higher than those found in saliva. The fractions of GSSG were 0.2-2.2% (RBC and blood) and 15-47% (saliva) of the free glutathione (GSH + 2xGSSG) in the corresponding samples. Up to 3% GSH was auto-oxidized to GSSG during sample workup; the highest oxidations (>1%) were in the saliva samples.","Fahrenholz, Timothy; Wolle, Mesay Mulugeta; Kingston, H M Skip; Faber, Scott; Kern, John C; Pamuku, Matt; Miller, Logan; Chatragadda, Hemasudha; Kogelnik, Andreas",Analytical chemistry,24,1

The Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium was formed to perform multiplexed assays testing adenocarcinomas of the lung for drivers in 10 genes to enable clinicians to select targeted treatments and enroll patients into clinical trials. OBJECTIVES To determine the frequency of oncogenic drivers in patients with lung adenocarcinomas and to use the data to select treatments targeting the identified driver(s) and measure survival. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From 2009 through 2012, 14 sites in the United States enrolled patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinomas and a performance status of 0 through 2 and tested their tumors for 10 drivers. Information was collected on patients, therapies, and survival. INTERVENTIONS Tumors were tested for 10 oncogenic drivers, and results were used to select matched targeted therapies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Determination of the frequency of oncogenic drivers, the proportion of patients treated with genotype-directed therapy, and survival. RESULTS From 2009 through 2012, tumors from 1007 patients were tested for at least 1 gene and 733 for 10 genes (patients with full genotyping). An oncogenic driver was found in 466 of 733 patients (64%). Among these 733 tumors, 182 tumors (25%) had the KRAS driver; sensitizing EGFR, 122 (17%); ALK rearrangements, 57 (8%); other EGFR, 29 (4%); 2 or more genes, 24 (3%); ERBB2 (formerly HER2), 19 (3%); BRAF, 16 (2%); PIK3CA, 6 (<1%); MET amplification, 5 (<1%); NRAS, 5 (<1%); MEK1, 1 (<1%); AKT1, 0. Results were used to select a targeted therapy or trial in 275 of 1007 patients (28%). The median survival was 3.5 years (interquartile range [IQR], 1.96-7.70) for the 260 patients with an oncogenic driver and genotype-directed therapy compared with 2.4 years (IQR, 0.88-6.20) for the 318 patients with any oncogenic driver(s) who did not receive genotype-directed therapy (propensity score-adjusted hazard ratio, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.53-0.9], P = .006). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Actionable drivers were detected in 64% of lung adenocarcinomas. Multiplexed testing aided physicians in selecting therapies. Although individuals with drivers receiving a matched targeted agent lived longer, randomized trials are required to determine if targeting therapy based on oncogenic drivers improves survival.

After the intubation, to confirm the position of the tube, we observed what we believed was the carina with a fiberoptic bronchoscope, but it was a site between the tracheal bronchus and the right main bronchus. Thus, a right-sided intubation was performed, and the left main bronchus was obstructed with a bronchial cuff. As a result of the inappropriate ventilation, peak inspiratory pressure was elevated and arterial oxygen saturation decreased. CONCLUSION Anesthesiologists should keep in mind the possibility of anatomical variation in the large airways, and bronchoscopy should be accompanied by cautious auscultation and confirmation of the division of the bronchus.","Cho, Ho Bum; Kim, Hyoung June; Gong, Hyung Youn; Kim, Mun Gyu; Kim, Sang Ho",Medicine,24,17

A simulated setting using virtual reality, synthetic, and/or organic models should precede traditional supervised training in the operating room. AIM The aim of the paper is to describe the Laparoscopic Surgical Skills (LSS) programme and to provide information about preliminary evaluation of Grade I Level 1 courses, including overall quality, applicability of the course content in practice and the balance between theory and hands-on training modules, by participating trainees. MATERIAL AND METHODS During 5 accredited LSS Grade I Level 1 courses held in Eindhoven (the Netherlands), Kosice (Slovak Republic), and Lisbon (Portugal) between April 2011 and January 2012, demographic data and pre-course surgical experience in laparoscopic surgery of the participants were recorded. The final course evaluation form was completed by each participant after the course (anonymous) to evaluate course progress, course materials, assessment, staff, location and overall impression of the course on a 1-10 scale to obtain feedback information. RESULTS Forty-seven surgeons of 5 different nationalities were enrolled in an LSS Grade I Level 1 programme. Most participants were first or second year residents (n = 25), but also already established surgeons took part (n = 6). The mean age of the participants was 31.2 years (SD = 2.86), the male/female ratio was 32/15, and previous experience with laparoscopic surgery was limited. Overall impression of the course was rated with 8.7 points (SD = 0.78). The applicability of the course content in practice and the balance between theory and hands-on training were also rated very well - mean 8.8 (SD = 1.01) and 8.1 points (SD = 0.80) respectively. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic Surgical Skills Grade I Level 1 courses are evaluated as well balanced, with content applicable in clinical practice, meeting the expectations of individual participants. International interest in the programme suggests that LSS might become the future European standard in surgical education in laparoscopic surgery. Further conclusions concerning success of the programme may be drawn after the completion of clinical assessment of enrolled participants.","Buzink, Sonja; Soltes, Marek; Radonak, Jozef; Fingerhut, Abe; Hanna, George; Jakimowicz, Jack",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,24,1

The objective of this study is to examine the prevalence and incidence of metabolic syndrome among adults of different racial/ethnic origins in high-income countries. METHODS We designed and registered a study protocol for a systematic review of descriptive epidemiological data. Observational studies (e.g., cross sectional and cohort studies) reporting morbidity data of metabolic syndrome and conducted in a wide range of adult people (e.g., different racial/ethnic origins, including migrants) will be included. The primary outcome will be the prevalence and incidence of metabolic syndrome. Secondary outcomes will be the prevalence and incidence of individual components of metabolic syndrome (e.g., abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, and high blood glucose). Literature searches will be conducted in several electronic databases (from inception onwards), including MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection (Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index), CINAHL, and Cochrane Library. Two investigators will independently screen all reference titles, abstracts, and full-text articles. The methodological quality (or potential bias) of selected studies will be appraised using an appropriate tool. Our results will be described narratively. Random-effects meta-analysis will be conducted, if feasible and appropriate. Additional analyses will be conducted to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity. CONCLUSION This systematic review will identify, evaluate, and integrate prevalence and incidence data of metabolic syndrome, with focus on racial/ethnic differences in high-income countries. We anticipate our findings may guide policy formulation and identify knowledge gaps in the literature that future research should address.

We aimed to evaluate first-line programmed cell death (PD)-1 inhibitor-based therapies in gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction, and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. We report the first results for nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. METHODS In this multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial (CheckMate 649), we enrolled adults (≥18 years) with previously untreated, unresectable, non-HER2-positive gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction, or oesophageal adenocarcinoma, regardless of PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression from 175 hospitals and cancer centres in 29 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1 while all three groups were open) via interactive web response technology (block sizes of six) to nivolumab (360 mg every 3 weeks or 240 mg every 2 weeks) plus chemotherapy (capecitabine and oxaliplatin every 3 weeks or leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin every 2 weeks), nivolumab plus ipilimumab, or chemotherapy alone. Primary endpoints for nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone were OS or progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review, in patients whose tumours had a PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) of five or more. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the assigned treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02872116. FINDINGS From March 27, 2017, to April 24, 2019, of 2687 patients assessed for eligibility, we concurrently randomly assigned 1581 patients to treatment (nivolumab plus chemotherapy [n=789, 50%] or chemotherapy alone [n=792, 50%]). The median follow-up for OS was 13·1 months (IQR 6·7-19·1) for nivolumab plus chemotherapy and 11·1 months (5·8-16·1) for chemotherapy alone. Nivolumab plus chemotherapy resulted in significant improvements in OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0·71 [98·4% CI 0·59-0·86]; p<0·0001) and PFS (HR 0·68 [98 % CI 0·56-0·81]; p<0·0001) versus chemotherapy alone in patients with a PD-L1 CPS of five or more (minimum follow-up 12·1 months). Additional results showed significant improvement in OS, along with PFS benefit, in patients with a PD-L1 CPS of one or more and all randomly assigned patients. Among all treated patients, 462 (59%) of 782 patients in the nivolumab plus chemotherapy group and 341 (44%) of 767 patients in the chemotherapy alone group had grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events. The most common any-grade treatment-related adverse events (≥25%) were nausea, diarrhoea, and peripheral neuropathy across both groups. 16 (2%) deaths in the nivolumab plus chemotherapy group and four (1%) deaths in the chemotherapy alone group were considered to be treatment-related. No new safety signals were identified. INTERPRETATION Nivolumab is the first PD-1 inhibitor to show superior OS, along with PFS benefit and an acceptable safety profile, in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in previously untreated patients with advanced gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction, or oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Nivolumab plus chemotherapy represents a new standard first-line treatment for these patients.

Anemia (Hemoglobin (Hb) < 10.5 g/dL) was assessed at delivery. A complete blood count results during pregnancy as well as maternal and obstetrical characteristics were collected. The primary endpoint was to determine the Hb cutoff between 24 and 30 gestational weeks that is predictive of anemia at delivery by using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve. Independent risk factors for anemia at delivery were assessed using stepwise multivariable logistic regression. Hb and infrequent iron supplement treatment were independent risk factors for anemia at delivery (OR 0.3 95%CI [0.2-0.4] and OR 2.4 95%CI [1.2-4.8], respectively; C statistics 83%). Hb 10.6 g/dL was an accurate cutoff to predict anemia at delivery (AUC 80% 95%CI 75-84%; sensitivity 75% and specificity 74%). Iron supplement was beneficial to prevent anemia regardless of Hb value. Altogether, Hb should be routinely tested between 24 and 30 gestational weeks to screen for anemia.

Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and climate-related disasters and often lack adequate mental healthcare infrastructure. We used the scoping review methodology to determine how exposure to climate change and climate-related disasters influences the presence of mental disorders among those living in LMICs. We also aimed to recognise existing gaps in this area of literature. METHODS This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. To identify relevant studies, we searched five electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, APA PsycInfo and Sociological Abstracts) from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2019. We also searched the grey literature. Included studies had an adult-focused LMIC population, a climate change or climate-related disaster exposure and a mental disorder outcome. Relevant study information was extracted and synthesised. RESULTS Fifty-eight studies were identified, most of which (n=48) employed a cross-sectional design. The most commonly studied exposure-outcome combinations were flood-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (n=28), flood-related depression (n=15) and storm-related PTSD (n=13). The majority of studies identified a positive exposure-outcome association. However, few studies included a baseline or comparator (ie, unexposed) group, thereby limiting our understanding of the magnitude or nature of this association. There was also great heterogeneity in this literature, making studies difficult to pool or compare. Several research gaps were identified including the lack of longitudinal studies and non-uniformity of geographic coverage. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, this was the first scoping review to investigate the relationship between climate change and climate-related disaster exposures and mental disorder outcomes in LMICs. Our findings support the need for further research, but also highlight that mental health should be a priority within LMIC climate change policy considerations.","Sharpe, Isobel; Davison, Colleen M",BMJ open,24,1

The spread of the disease in endemic countries and the potential introduction of sporadic cases in other continents points out the global health threat of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Despite the urgent need for treating EVD, there are no approved treatments. Given the lack of treatments available, alternative therapeutic strategies have had to be used. AREAS COVERED This article summarizes the unregistered therapeutics that were used to treat patients during the Ebola 2014/2015 outbreak, in addition to approaches used for the selection of candidate drugs. The article also proposes potential theoretical criterion for use in virtual screening of molecular libraries for candidate Ebola drugs. EXPERT OPINION In the absence of approved therapeutics for EVD, experimental drugs have had to be used. The repurposing of approved drugs for the treatment of EVD, as an alternative therapeutic strategy, has also been suggested. Screening in vitro- and in silico-approved drugs revealed several promising candidates but further testing is required to test their efficacy. All these therapeutic approaches are, however, only short-term solutions and there is still an urgent need for the development of specific drugs for the current and future outbreaks.","Glisic, Sanja; Paessler, Slobodan; Veljkovic, Nevena; Perovic, Vladimir R; Prljic, Jelena; Veljkovic, Veljko",Expert opinion on drug discovery,24,1

This study sought to determine the association between blunt and penetrating neck injuries on mortality and length of stay, and to identify additional patient and hospital-level characteristics that impact these outcomes. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohort study utilizing the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program database. METHODS Adult patients (≥18) who sustained traumatic injuries involving the soft tissues of the neck between 2012 and 2016 were eligible. Multiple imputation was used to account for missing data. Logistic regression and negative binomial models were used to analyze 1) in-hospital mortality and 2) length of stay respectively while adjusting for potential confounders and accounting for clustering at the hospital level. RESULTS In a cohort of 20,285 patients, the crude mortality rate was lower in those sustaining blunt neck injuries compared to penetrating injuries (4.9% vs. 6.0%, P < .01), while length of hospital stay was similar (median 9.9 vs. 10.2, P = 0.06). In adjusted analysis, blunt neck injuries were associated with a reduced odds of mortality during hospital admission (odds ratio: 0.66, 95% confidence intervals [0.564, 0.788]), as well as significant reductions in length of stay (rate ratio: 0.92, 95% confidence intervals [0.880, 0.954]). CONCLUSIONS Blunt neck injuries are associated with lower mortality and length of stay compared to penetrating injuries. Areas of future study have been identified, including elucidation of processes of care in specific organs of injury.

Its pharmacologic profile includes blockade at dopamine and other monoamine receptors and attenuation of cocaine self-administration, reinstatement, and rewarding properties in rats. This study evaluated the safety of l-THP in human cocaine users and its influence on the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of cocaine. Twenty-four cocaine-using adult men were randomized to receive l-THP (30 mg twice a day orally) or placebo double-blind for 4 days, with an intranasal cocaine (40 mg) challenge on the fourth day. Safety and tolerability were evaluated using vital signs, ECG, clinical laboratory tests, and standardized self-report instruments. Peripheral venous blood was collected periodically and later assayed for l-THP and cocaine using highly sensitive and specific ultraperformance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection (UPLC-FLD) methods. Twenty subjects completed the study, of whom 19 provided complete PK data. The short 3.5-day course of l-THP was safe and well tolerated and did not affect cocaine's PK or its acute cardiovascular effects. The cocaine AUC0→∞ was 211.5 and 261.4 h·ng/mL, and the Cmax was 83.3 and 104.5 ng/mL for the l-THP and placebo groups, respectively. In addition there were no significant differences in the number of side effects reported in each group (l-THP group 22 [48%], placebo group 24 [52%]) or vital signs including, heart rate, blood pressure, complete blood count, or ECG. These findings suggest that oral THP has promise for further development as a treatment for CUD.","Hassan, Hazem E; Kelly, Deanna; Honick, Moshe; Shukla, Sagar; Ibrahim, Ahmed; Gorelick, David A; Glassman, Matthew; McMahon, Robert P; Wehring, Heidi J; Kearns, Ann Marie; Feldman, Stephanie; Yu, Mingming; Bauer, Ken; Wang, Jia Bei",Journal of clinical pharmacology,24,1

In mechanically ventilated patients a continuous noninvasive monitoring of carbon dioxide would obviously be attractive. In the current study, we present a novel formula for noninvasive estimation of arterial carbon dioxide. Eighty-one datasets were collected from 19 anesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs. Eleven animals were mechanically ventilated without interventions. In the remaining eight pigs the partial pressure of carbon dioxide was manipulated. The new formula (Formula 1) is PaCO₂ = PETCO₂ + k(PETO₂ - PaO₂) where PaO₂ was calculated from the oxygen saturation. We tested the agreements of this novel formula and compared it to a traditional method using the baseline PaCO₂ - ETCO₂ gap added to subsequently measured, end-tidal carbon dioxide levels (Formula 2). The mean difference between PaCO₂ and calculated carbon dioxide (Formula 1) was 0.16 kPa (±SE 1.17). The mean difference between PaCO₂ and carbon dioxide with Formula 2 was 0.66 kPa (±SE 0.18). With a mixed linear model excluding cases with cardiorespiratory collapse, there was a significant difference between formulae (p < 0.001), as well as significant interaction between formulae and time (p < 0.001). In this preliminary animal study, this novel formula appears to have a reasonable agreement with PaCO₂ values measured with ABG analysis, but needs further validation in human patients.","Rentola, Raisa; Hästbacka, Johanna; Heinonen, Erkki; Rosenberg, Per H; Häggblom, Tom; Skrifvars, Markus B",Journal of clinical medicine,24,1

This study aimed to test for the existence of serum biomarkers in CLBP patients with MC. METHODS Age- and sex-matched CLBP patients with confirmed MC on lumbar MRI (n = 40) and pain-free controls (n = 40) were assessed. MC was classified into M1, predominating M1, predominating M2 and M2. MC volumes were calculated. Fasting blood samples were assessed for inflammatory mediators, signalling molecules, growth factors and bone turnover markers. Serum concentrations of 46 biomarkers were measured. RESULTS Median concentrations of interleukin (IL)-15 (p < 0.001), IL-8 (p < 0.001), tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (p < 0.001), Eotaxin-1 (p < 0.05), Eotaxin-3 (p < 0.001), monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 (p < 0.05), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha (p < 0.01), TEK receptor tyrosine kinase (Tie)-2 (p < 0.001), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 (p < 0.001), RANTES (p < 0.001), C telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX)-1 (p < 0.001), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C (p < 0.001), VEGF-D (p < 0.05), fms-related tyrosine kinase (Flt)-1 (p < 0.01) and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 (p < 0.01) were significantly higher among controls.

Because of its pre-assembled nature, the SCT presents enhanced expression and presentation of the antigenic peptide/MHC complexes at the cell surface. Furthermore, DNA vaccination with a plasmid DNA encoding an SCT incorporating an immunodominant viral epitope elicited protective CD8(+) T cell responses against lethal virus infection. To extend these findings, here we tested the efficacy of SCT DNA vaccines against bacterial infections. In a mouse infection model of Listeria monocytogenes, the SCT DNA vaccine encoding H-2K(d) and the immunodominant peptide LLO 91-99 generated functional primary and memory peptide-specific CD8(+) T cells that confer partial protection against L. monocytogenes infection. DNA immunization of K(d)/LLO(91-99) SCTs generated functional memory CD8(+) T cells independently of CD4(+) T cells, although the expression of cognate or non-cognate CD4(+) helper T cell epitopes further enhanced the protective efficacy of SCTs. Our study further demonstrates that the SCT serves as a potent platform for DNA vaccines against various infectious diseases.","Kim, Sojung; Zuiani, Adam; Carrero, Javier A; Hansen, Ted H",Vaccine,24,6

The objective was to understand the effectiveness of RUTF containing alternative sources of protein (nondairy), or <50% of protein from dairy products, compared with standard RUTF in children with SAM. The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched using terms relating to RUTF. Studies were eligible if they included children with SAM and evaluated RUTF with <50% of protein from dairy products compared with standard RUTF. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were completed to assess the effectiveness of intervention RUTF on a range of child outcomes. The quality of the evidence across outcomes was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. A total of 5868 studies were identified, of which 8 articles of 6 studies met the inclusion criteria evaluating 7 different intervention RUTF recipes. Nondairy or lower-dairy RUTF showed less weight gain (standardized mean difference: -0.20; 95% CI: -0.26, -0.15; P < 0.001), lower recovery (relative risk ratio: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.87, 1.00; P = 0.046), and lower weight-for-age z scores (WAZ) near program discharge (mean difference: -0.10; 95% CI: -0.20, 0.0; P = 0.047). Mortality, time to recovery, default (consecutive absences from outpatient therapeutic feeding program visits), nonresponse, and other anthropometric measures did not differ between groups. The certainty of evidence was high for weight gain and ranged from very low to moderate for other outcomes. RUTF with lower protein from dairy or dairy-free RUTF may not be as effective as standard RUTF for treatment of children with SAM based on weight gain, recovery, and WAZ evaluated using meta-analysis, although further research is required to explore the potential of alternative formulations.

Here, we investigate in long-time (μs) molecular dynamics simulations combined with extensive quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations the primary electron transfer (ET) reactions in 64-photolyase of Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster). The characterization of the relative energetics of locally excited and charge separated states in the (6-4) photoproduct enzyme repair complex reveals a charge-separated state involving the adenine moiety of the FADH- cofactor that facilitates reduction of the photoproduct. Microscopic details of the collective reaction coordinate of ET reactions are identified that involve the reorganization of the hydrogen bond network and structural relaxation of the active site. The simulations reveal complex active site relaxation dynamics involving distinguished amino acids (Lys246, His365, and His369), conformational reorganization of the hydroxyl group of the (6-4) photoproduct, and a strengthening of hydrogen bonds with immobilized water molecules. In particular, rotation of the Lys246 side chain is found to impose a double-well character along the reaction coordinate of the ET reaction. Our findings suggest that the primary ET reactions in the (6-4) photoproduct enzyme repair complex of D. melanogaster are governed by a complex multi-minima active site relaxation dynamics and potentially precede the equilibration of the protein. ET pathways mediated by the adenine moiety and the 5' side of the photoproduct are proposed to be relevant for triggering the catalytic (6-4) photoproduct reactivation.","Osswald, Mara; Fingerhut, Benjamin P",The journal of physical chemistry.

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a novel porous organic material, have attracted great attention. In this work, the spherical triphenylbenzene-dimethoxyterephthaldehyde-COFs (TPB-DMTP-COFs) were synthesized by a simple room temperature method, and due to their attractive properties, such as high outstanding acid-base stability, large specific surface area, low skeletal density, inherent porosity and high crystallinity, so TPB-DMTP-COFs as ideal solid phase extraction adsorbents showed excellent adsorption performance for trace polar sulfonamides in food and water. TPB-DMTP-COFs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and so on. The important parameters were optimized to improve the extraction efficiency of TPB-DMTP-COFs toward sulfonamides. Analysis of sulfonamides was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The developed method based on TPB-DMTP-COFs material achieved low limits of detection (0.5-1.0 ng L-1), wide linearity (5-1000 ng L-1), and good repeatability (2.5%-8.7%). The possible extraction mechanism was also discussed. Finally, the method was successfully applied to the enrichment and detection of sulfonamides in environmental water samples and food samples. The present study indicated that TPB-DMTP-COFs had splendid prospects in highly sensitive analysis of other pollutants in complex matrix.","Wen, Lian; Liu, Lu; Wang, Xia; Wang, Ming-Lin; Lin, Jin-Ming; Zhao, Ru-Song",Journal of chromatography.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic response of patients with different EGFR exon 19dels to first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and the mechanisms by which their tumors acquire resistance to these TKIs. PATIENTS AND METHODS The clinical outcomes of 195 patients harboring EGFR exon 19dels and receiving first-generation EGFR TKIs between July 2011 and June 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS A total of twenty EGFR exon 19dels variants were identified. The patients were divided into three groups according to the first residue of the deletion, including E746, L747, and other residues (T751 or S752). The median progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated with EGFR TKIs was significantly different between groups (p < 0.001). Patients harboring EGFR exon 19dels starting at T751 or S752 had the shortest median PFS (2.9 months), followed by those with E746 (11.4 months) and those with L747 (17.2 months). Analyzing 140 patients who had progressed on therapy, EGFR exon 19dels beginning at T751 or S752 were associated with a low incidence of the T790M mutation (16.7%). CONCLUSIONS Deletion location and type variants (with or without an insertion and/or a substitution) might affect first-generation TKI efficacy, and different EGFR exon 19dels should be considered when making decisions on which EGFR TKI should be used.","Xu, Haiyan; Li, Weihua; Yang, Guangjian; Li, Junling; Yang, Lu; Xu, Fei; Yang, Yaning; Ying, Jianming; Wang, Yan",Targeted oncology,24,25

The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device is an intrasaccular braided device, recently approved by the FDA for treatment of WNBAs. While treatment of intracranial aneurysms with the WEB device has been shown to yield an adequate occlusion rate of 85% at 1 year, few data have been published for patients with ruptured aneurysms. OBJECTIVE To present a multi-institutional series depicting the safety and efficacy of using the WEB device as the primary treatment modality in ruptured intracranial aneurysms. METHODS A multi-institutional retrospective analysis was conducted, assessing patients presenting with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage treated with the WEB between January 2014 and April 2020. Baseline demographics, aneurysm characteristics, adverse events, and long-term outcomes (occlusion, re-treatment, functional status) were collected. A descriptive analysis was performed, and variables potentially associated with aneurysm recurrence or re-treatment were assessed. RESULTS Forty-eight patients were included. Anterior communicating artery aneurysms were the most common (35.4%) location for treatment, followed by middle cerebral artery (20.8%) and basilar apex (16.7%). Procedural success was noted in 95.8% of patients, and clinically significant periprocedural adverse events occurred in 12.5%. After a median follow-up of 5.5 months, 54.2% of patients had follow-up angiographic imaging. Complete occlusion was seen in 61.5% of cases with adequate occlusion in 92.3%. Re-treatment was required in only 4.2% of patients during the study period. Tobacco use was significantly higher in patients with aneurysm recurrence (88.9% vs 35.7%; p=0.012). No other characteristics were associated with recurrence/re-treatment. At 30 days, 81.1% were functionally independent (modified Rankin Scale score ≤2). CONCLUSION Treatment of acutely ruptured aneurysms with the WEB device demonstrates both safety and efficacy on par with rates of conventional treatment strategies.","Youssef, Patrick P; Dornbos Iii, David; Peterson, Jeremy; Sweid, Ahmad; Zakeri, Amanda; Nimjee, Shahid M; Jabbour, Pascal; Arthur, Adam S",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,24,20

METHODS The clinical data of 131 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Tianjin Third Central Hospital from March 2016 to June 2019 were collected. The basic data of patients, including gender, age, body mass index (BMI), causes of ARDS, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2), were collected. The CT imaging data of patients on the 1st and 7th day in the ICU were collected. According to the CT value, they were divided into hyperventilated areas (-1 000 to -900 HU), normal ventilation areas (-899 to -500 HU), poorly ventilated areas (-499 to -100 HU), and atelectasis area (-99 to 100 HU). The total lung volume and the percentage of NILT to the total lung volume (NILT%) were calculate. At the same time, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, total length of hospital stay were collected. According to the 28-day follow-up, they were divided into survival group and death group. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors for 28-day death in ARDS patients. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn, the area under ROC curve (AUC) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated to determine the accuracy of NILT% in predicting the 28-day prognosis of ARDS patients, and the NILT% threshold was used for subgroup analysis of patients. RESULTS Among the 131 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, patients were excluded for more than 48 hours after ARDS diagnosis, repeated admission to ICU due to ARDS, the ICU duration less than 7 days, death within 72 hours of admission, chronic interstitial lung disease or congestive heart failure, no chest CT examination within 7 days of admission to ICU, and no specimen collection within 2 hours of admission to ICU. Finally, a total of 53 patients were enrolled in the analysis. Of the 53 patients, 31 patients survived and 22 patients died. The 28-day mortality was 41.5%. Compared with the survival group, patients in the death group were older (years old: 65.32±11.29 vs. 55.77±14.23), and had a higher SOFA score (11.68±3.82 vs. 8.39±2.23) with significant differences (both P < 0.05), while there were no significant differences in gender, BMI, ARDS cause, APACHE II score and PaO2/FiO2 between the two groups. There was no significant difference in CT value, total lung volume and NILT% between the two groups at 1st day after admission to ICU; NILT% on day 7 after admission to ICU in the death group was significantly higher than that in the survival group [(28.95±8.40)% vs. (20.35±5.91)%, P < 0.01], but there was no significant difference in CT value and total lung volume between the two groups. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that the 28-day prognosis of ARDS was related to age, SOFA score and NILT% independently [age: odds ratio (OR) = 0.892, 95%CI was 0.808-0.984, P = 0.023; SOFA score: OR = 0.574, 95%CI was 0.387-0.852, P = 0.006; NILT%: OR = 0.841, 95%CI was 0.730-0.968, P = 0.016]. ROC curve analysis showed that 7-day NILT% could predict the 28-day prognosis of patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, and AUC was 0.810 (95%CI was 0.678-0.952, P < 0.01). The NILT% threshold was 15.50%, sensitivity was 95.5%, specificity was 80.6%, positive predictive value was 85.7%, and negative predictive value was 74.6%. According to the 7-day NILT% threshold, a subgroup analysis of patients was performed, and 7-day NILT% > 15.50% was defined as a high-risk clinical prognosis, and ≤ 15.50% was a low-risk. Compared with low-risk patients (n = 7), the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of ICU stay and total length of hospital stay in high-risk patients (n = 46) were significantly prolonged [duration of mechanical ventilation (days): 9.37±6.14 vs. 4.43±1.72, length of ICU stay (days): 12.11±5.85 vs. 7.57±1.13, total length of hospital stay (days): 18.39±5.87 vs. 11.29±2.22, all P < 0.05].

The purpose of this study was to evaluate specific alterations to the electromyogram (EMG) and verify safe alarm limits in a porcine model of sustained traction of the RLN using continuous intraoperative neuromonitoring (C-IONM). METHODS Sixteen Norwegian Landrace pigs were anesthetized and intubated with a tracheal tube with a stick-on laryngeal electrode. EMG was recorded at baseline (BL) and during sustained traction applied to each RLN until 70 % amplitude decrease from BL, and during 30-min recovery. RESULTS In 29 nerves at risk (NAR), BL amplitude and latency values were 1098 ± 418 (586-2255) μV (mean ± SD (range)) (right vagus) and 845 ± 289 (522-1634) μV (left vagus), and 4.7 ± 0.5 (4.1-5.9) ms and 7.9 ± 0.8 (6.7-9.6) ms, respectively. At 50 % amplitude decrease, latency increased by 14.0 ± 5.7 % (right side) and 14.5 ± 9.1 % (left side) compared with BL. Corresponding values for 70 % amplitude depression were 17.9 ± 6.1 % and 17.3 ± 12.8 %. Traction time to 50 and 70 % amplitude decrease ranged from 3 to 133 min and 3.9-141 min, respectively. In 16 NAR (55 %), time from 50 to 70 % reduction in amplitude was ≤5 min, but in six NAR (21 %) ≤1 min. In only 11 (38 %) of 29 nerves, the amplitude recovered to more than 50 % of BL. CONCLUSIONS Latency increase may be the first warning of RLN stretch injury. Given the short interval between 50 and 70 % amplitude reduction of the EMG, amplitude reduction by 50 % can be taken as an appropriate alert limit.","Brauckhoff, Katrin; Aas, Turid; Biermann, Martin; Husby, Paul",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,24,1

Individuals who walk at least 10 000 steps per day are likely to meet recommended physical activity guidelines. Very little is known about the physical activity levels of doctors at work, in particular those working in emergency departments (EDs). OBJECTIVES To determine how many steps per shift were taken by doctors in a South African (SA) ED. Secondary objectives were to assess what factors influenced the number of steps taken. METHODS This was a prospective observational cohort study in a tertiary academic teaching hospital ED in Johannesburg over a 1-month period. Doctors wore pedometers during their day shifts in the ED and the number of steps taken during their shifts was measured, as well as the number and triage category of patients seen and whether cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed. RESULTS The median (interquartile range) number of steps taken per shift was 6 328 (4 646 - 8 409). The number of steps taken exceeded the 10 000-step target in only 11.7% of shifts. The overall mean (standard deviation (SD)) number of steps per hour was 744 (490). Factors that significantly increased the number of steps taken included shift duration, number of patients seen who were triaged yellow, and performance of CPR in a shift. Each additional hour of shift led to a mean (SD) increase of 575 (115) steps. Each additional yellow patient seen led to a mean (SD) increase of 118 (108) steps. The mean (SD) number of steps for a shift with CPR was significantly higher (8 309 (850) steps) than for a shift without CPR (6 496 (384) steps). CONCLUSIONS Doctors working in an SA ED are not achieving the daily recommended number of steps while at work. The increased risk of ill health and burnout in an already high-risk specialty heightens the importance of exercise and physical activity that needs to be achieved outside the workplace.","Beringer, C B; Wells, M; Goldstein, L N",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,24,17

SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19 and uses ACE2 as a cell receptor to invade human cells. Therefore, ACE2 is a key factor to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS We included 9,783 sequencing results of different organs, analyzed the effects of different ACE2 expression patterns in organs and immune regulation. RESULTS We found that ACE2 expression was significantly increased in the lungs and digestive tract. The cellular immunity of individuals with elevated ACE2 expression is activated, whereas humoral immunity is dampened, leading to the release of many inflammatory factors dominated by IL6. Furthermore, by studying the sequencing results of SARS-CoV-2-infected and uninfected cells, IL6 was found to be an indicator of a significant increase in the number of infected cells. However, although patients with high expression of ACE2 will release many inflammatory factors dominated by IL6, cellular immunity in the colorectum is significantly activated. This effect may explain why individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection have severe lung symptoms and digestion issues, which are important causes of milder symptoms. CONCLUSIONS This finding indicates that ACE2 and IL6 inhibitors have important value in COVID-19.","Bao, Z; Wang, L-J; He, K; Lin, X; Yu, T; Li, J; Gong, J; Xiang, G",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,24,17

Online databases were searched to identify papers published in English between January 2010 through July 2019; the search identified 25 articles. The Toileting Behaviors-Women's Elimination Behaviors scale has been published in four validated language versions and used in 17 of the 25 studies. The most frequent behaviors include concern about public toilet cleanliness, delaying urination when busy or away from home, and using different toileting postures at and away from home. Determinants of toileting behaviors include environmental factors, chronic health conditions, and cognitive/psychological factors. Associations were found between toileting behaviors and lower urinary tract symptoms and between toileting postures and uroflowmetric parameters and post-void residual volume. Strategies that address modifiable determinants of toileting behaviors should be developed and tested in future research. Furthermore, little is known about the toileting behaviors and bladder health in older women and women from developing countries. Rigorous studies are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms of toileting behaviors, the nature of associations between toileting behaviors and lower urinary tract symptoms, and effects of the environment on women's toileting behaviors.","Wu, Chen; Xue, Kaikai; Palmer, Mary H",International journal of environmental research and public health,24,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS Detailed information on compounds in the HQ-BS herb pair was obtained from the Traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology (TCMSP) and screened by the criteria of OB ≥30% and DL ≥0.18. A systematic drug targeting model (SysDT) was used for compound targets prediction, and then the targets were analyzed for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of HQ-BS targets was constructed, after identifying core networks through Cytoscape plugins. RESULTS We found 47 bioactive compounds of HQ-BS and 107 human-derived targets. A compound target network and a target signal pathway network were constructed and used for topological analysis. Kaempferol, beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, wogonin, and oroxylin-a were identified as core compounds and pathways in cancer. The calcium signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, chemical carcinogenesis, estrogen signaling pathway, proteoglycans in cancer, HIF-1 signaling pathway, thyroid hormone signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and T cell receptor signaling pathway were found to be potential signals of HQ-BS in treating cancer. Through PPI network analysis, TNF signaling pathway, tryptophan metabolism, proteoglycans in cancer, cell cycle, and chemical carcinogenesis sub-networks were obtained. CONCLUSIONS HQ-BS contains various bioactive compounds, including flavonoids, phytosterols, and other compounds, and these compounds can inhibit or activate multiple targets and pathways against cancer.","Xu, Tian; Wang, Qingguo; Liu, Min",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,24,1

Methods: The daily incidence data and case information of COVID-19 were collected from the official websites of provincial and municipal health commissions. The morbidity rate, severity rate, case-fatality rate, and spread ratio of COVID-19 were calculated. Results: As of 20 March, 2020, a total of 12 941 cases of COVID-19 had been conformed, including 116 deaths, and the average morbidity rate, severity rate and case-fatality rate were 0.97/100 000, 13.5% and 0.90%, respectively. The morbidity rates in Zhejiang (2.12/100 000), Jiangxi (2.01/100 000) and Beijing (1.93/100 000) ranked top three. The characteristics of COVID-19 case spectrum varied from province to province. The first three provinces (autonomous region, municipality) with high severity rates were Tianjin (45.6%), Xinjiang (35.5%) and Heilongjiang (29.5%). The case-fatality rate was highest in Xinjiang (3.95%), followed by Hainan (3.57%) and Heilongjiang (2.70%). The average spread ratio was 0.98 and the spread intensity varied from province to province. Tibet had the lowest spread ratio (0), followed by Qinghai (0.20) and Guangdong (0.23). Conclusion: The intervention measures were effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and improved treatment effect in China.

In the current literature, the effects of high body mass index (BMI) on the results of the surgical therapy have not been sufficiently investigated after SILC. We evaluated perioperative outcomes and postoperative complications of overweight patients who underwent SILC. METHODS Two hundred two patients who underwent SILC were retrospectively evaluated. The data included demographics and outcomes such as postoperative complications and postoperative hospitalization were obtained. For the outcome analyses, patients were divided into two group according to their BMI (<30 vs ≥ 30 kg/m(2)). RESULTS Of the 202 patients, 157 patients were in normal weight group and 45 patients were in overweight group. Mean operative time was 31.67 ± 6.4 min in overweight group and 26.6 ± 5.3 min in normal weight group. The wound infection rate for overweight and normal weight patients was 13.3 and 7.6 %, respectively. Eleven of the 202 patients (5.4 %) experienced port-site hernia (PSH). CONCLUSIONS This retrospective study comparing overweight and normal weight patient in SILC demonstrates that SILC is associated with the prolonged operative time, high additional port requirement, and increased wound complication rate. PSH occurrence rate was high after SILC irrespective of the body weight.","Yilmaz, Huseyin; Alptekin, Husnu; Acar, Fahrettin; Calisir, Akin; Sahin, Mustafa",Obesity surgery,24,1

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association of SDB during REM sleep with daytime sleepiness, health-related QOL, and difficulty maintaining sleep, in comparison to their association with SDB during non-REM sleep in a community-based cohort. METHODS Cross-sectional analysis of 5,649 Sleep Heart Health Study participants (mean age 62.5 [SD = 10.9], 52.6% women, 22.6% ethnic minorities). SDB during REM and non-REM sleep was quantified using polysomnographically derived apnea-hypopnea index in REM (AHI(REM)) and non-REM (AHI(NREM)) sleep. Sleepiness, sleep maintenance, and QOL were respectively quantified using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Sleep Heart Health Study Sleep Habit Questionnaire, and the physical and mental composites scales of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF)-36. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS AHI(REM) was not associated with the ESS scores or the physical and mental components scales scores of the SF-36 after adjusting for demographics, body mass index, and AHI(NREM) x AHI(REM) was not associated with frequent difficulty maintaining sleep or early awakening from sleep. AHI(NREM) was associated with the ESS score (beta = 0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16 to 0.34) and the physical (beta = -0.12; 95% CI, -0.42 to -0.01) and mental (beta = -0.20; 95% CI, -0.20 to -0.01) components scores of the SF-36 adjusting for demographics, body mass index, and AHI(REM). CONCLUSIONS In a community-based sample of middle-aged and older adults, REM-predominant SDB is not independently associated with daytime sleepiness, impaired health-related QOL, or self-reported sleep disruption.","Chami, Hassan A; Baldwin, Carol M; Silverman, Angela; Zhang, Ying; Rapoport, David; Punjabi, Naresh M; Gottlieb, Daniel J",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,24,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS This study included 21 consecutive patients who met inclusion criteria (all men; mean age, 66.0 y) and had pulmonary metastases from esophageal cancer. There were 31 tumors (mean size, 1.7 cm) that were treated with 27 planned ablation sessions. At the initial RF ablation sessions, 3 patients had viable extrapulmonary recurrences, and 18 patients had viable recurrences confined to the lung. Primary study endpoints included patient survival and the determination of prognostic factors. Secondary endpoints included local efficacy and safety of the treatment. The log-rank test was used to identify prognostic factors. Adverse events were evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0. RESULTS Median follow-up duration after the initial RF ablation was 22.4 months (range, 6.2-76.1 mo). Estimated overall survival rates were 85.7% at 1 year, 54.8% at 2 years, and 38.4% at 3 years after the initial RF ablation session. The presence of viable extrapulmonary recurrences at the initial RF ablation session was an unfavorable prognostic factor (P < .001). Local tumor progression was observed in 25.8% (8 of 31) of tumors and occurred 2.6-10.0 months (median, 4.8 mo) after RF ablation. Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 7.4% (2 of 27) of sessions, including pleural effusion requiring chest tube placement and pneumoderma requiring surgical intervention. No grade 4 or greater adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS RF ablation is a promising treatment option for patients with pulmonary metastases from esophageal cancer.","Matsui, Yusuke; Hiraki, Takao; Gobara, Hideo; Fujiwara, Hiroyasu; Iguchi, Toshihiro; Shirakawa, Yasuhiro; Fujiwara, Toshiyoshi; Toyooka, Shinichi; Kanazawa, Susumu",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,24,16

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between sidedness, recurrence, and survival among patients with localized colon cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent curative resection of colon cancer (2006-2013) were identified from a prospective database and retrospectively analyzed. Risk for recurrence, overall survival, and survival after recurrence (SAR) were compared between left- and right-sided tumors using the log-rank test, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS We evaluated 673 patients (347 right-sided). There was no difference in overall recurrence rates (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-1.55; P = .75) or overall survival (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.75-1.97; P = .42) between right- and left-sided primary tumors. However, right-sided tumors were more likely to develop multi-focal and poor prognostic site recurrence (P = .04). Among the 71 patients who developed recurrence, those with right-sided tumors had significantly lower SAR (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.42-10.62; P = .008). CONCLUSIONS Among patients with colon cancer who underwent curative resection, tumor sidedness was not associated with recurrence risk. However, among patients who developed recurrence, right-sidedness was associated with unique recurrence patterns and inferior SAR. For patients presenting with localized disease, treatment stratification should not be based on tumor sidedness alone.","Malakorn, Songphol; Ouchi, Akira; Hu, Chung-Yuan; Sandhu, Lakhbir; Dasari, Arvind; You, Yi-Qian Nancy; Kopetz, E Scott; Ellis, Lee M; Chang, George J",Clinical colorectal cancer,24,29

Using three-dimensional NMR spectra, molecular dynamics simulations, and alanine mutations, we identified that the interaction network between pT69/pS70 and R106/R109 residues prevents the phosphorylation sites from exposure to phosphatase and subsequent dephosphorylation. A Bcl-2-dephosphorylation probe, S1-6e, was designed by installing a carboxylic acid group to a Bcl-2 inhibitor. The carboxyl group competitively disrupts the interaction network between R106/R109 and pT69/pS70 and subsequently facilitates Bcl-2 dephosphorylation in living cells. As a result, S1-6e manifests a more effective apoptosis induction in pBcl-2-dependent cancer cells than other inhibitors exhibiting a similar binding affinity for Bcl-2. We believe that targeting the allosteric pathways interconnecting the core-functional domain and the phosphorylation site can be a general strategy for a rational design of site-specific dephosphorylating probes, since the allosteric pathway has been discovered in a variety of proteins.","Wang, Ziqian; Song, Ting; Guo, Zongwei; Cao, Keke; Chen, Chao; Feng, Yingang; Wang, Hang; Yin, Fangkui; Zhou, Sheng; Dai, Jian; Zhang, Zhichao",Journal of medicinal chemistry,24,7

METHODS This prospective, randomized study included 190 patients enrolled from October 2011 to July 2013. The numbers of patients in the LSJ group and the CT group were both 95. We studied the following: operative times, intraoperative and postoperative blood losses, intact parathormone (iPTH) and calcium serum levels, and the incidence of RLN paralysis. RESULTS The two cohorts were homogeneous for age, sex, surgical indication, BMI, ASA score, and estimated thyroid volume. Operation time has been 73.90 ± 23.35 min in group CT and 60.20 ± 22.36 min in group LSJ (p = 0.002). Intraoperative blood losses have been 47 ± 18 ml in group CT and 38 ± 14 in group LSJ (p = 0.002), while postoperative blood losses have been 45 ± 21 ml in group CT and 40 ± 20 in group LSJ (p = 0.105). The mean calcium blood level in group CT has been 8.12, 7.79, and 7.92 mg/dl in the first, second, and third postoperative days, respectively, as well as 8.26, 7.97, and 8.22 mg/dl for group LSJ (p > 0.05).

CASE DESCRIPTION We present two patients with covid-19 and concurrent neurological symptoms. Our first patient is a 31-year-old man who had flu-like symptoms due to covid-19 and later developed an acute-onset severe headache and loss of consciousness and was diagnosed with a Hunt and Hess grade 3 subarachnoid haemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm. Our second patient is a 62-year-old woman who had an ischaemic stroke with massive haemorrhagic conversion requiring a decompressive hemicraniectomy. Both patients' CSF was repeatedly negative on real-time PCR analysis despite concurrent neurological disease. CONCLUSION Our report shows that patients' CSF may be devoid of viral particles even when they test positive for covid-19 on a nasal swab.

BACKGROUND Few studies have evaluated sex-related benefits of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Moreover, data on sex-related differences in the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in this population are limited. METHODS A multicenter retrospective study was conducted in 460 patients (355 male subjects and 105 female subjects) from the UMBRELLA (Incidence of Arrhythmia in Spanish Population With a Medtronic Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator Implant) national registry. Patients were followed up through remote monitoring after the first implantation of a CRT-D during a median follow-up of 2.2 ± 1.0 years. Sex differences were analyzed in terms of ventricular arrhythmia-treated incidence and death during the follow-up period, with a particular focus on primary prevention patients. RESULTS Baseline New York Heart Association functional class was worse in women compared with that in men (67.0% of women in New York Heart Association functional class III vs. 49.7% of men; p = 0.003), whereas women had less ischemic cardiac disease (20.8% vs. 41.7%; p < 0.001). Female sex was an independent predictor of ventricular arrhythmias (hazard ratio: 0.40; 95% confidence interval: 0.19 to 0.86; p = 0.020), as well as left ventricular ejection fraction and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Mortality in women was one-half that of men, although events were scarce and without significant differences (2.9% vs. 5.6%; p = 0.25). CONCLUSIONS Women with left bundle branch block and implanted CRT have a lower rate of ventricular tachyarrhythmias than men.

We used the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence to facilitate data synthesis. From 86 retrieved studies, we collated data on 2,560 patients with dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19. The most common findings were chilblains/pernio-like lesion (51.5%), erythematous maculopapular rashes (13.3%), and viral exanthem (7.7%). Average pediatric age was 12.9 years (SD 3.6) and adult was 34.2 years (SD 21.8). Average latency from time of upper respiratory illness symptoms to cutaneous findings was 1.5 days (SD 2.9) in children and 7.9 days (SD 10.7) in adults, ranging from -3 to 38 days.

The viruses in this lineage are unique in their ecological success, demonstrating an extremely broad host range and becoming established in poultry over much of Asia and in Africa. H5N1 viruses have also diverged into multiple clades and subclades that generally do not cross neutralize, which has greatly confounded control measures in poultry and pre-pandemic vaccine strain selection. Although H5N1 viruses currently cannot transmit efficiently between mammals they exhibit high mortality in humans and recent experimental studies have shown that it is possible to generate an H5N1 virus that is transmissible in mammals. In addition to causing unprecedented economic losses, the long-term presence of the H5N1 virus in poultry and its frequent introductions to humans continue to pose a significant pandemic threat. Here we provide a summary of the genesis, molecular epidemiology and evolution of this H5N1 lineage, particularly the factors that have contributed to the continued diversification and ecological success of H5N1 viruses, with particular reference to the poultry production systems they have emerged from.","Guan, Yi; Smith, Gavin J D",Virus research,24,19

Methods The nationwide administrative database (German federal statistical office) was used to extract all adult inpatient TIA and stroke cases and corresponding procedural codes for the period 2011-2017. Numbers were specified according to age, sex, stroke unit (SU) and critical care treatment (ICU), early transfer, and in-hospital mortality. Findings Inpatient adult TIA/stroke cases increased from annually 102,406 / 250,199 (2011) to 106,245 / 264,208 (2017). 84% of strokes were ischemic (AIS) also having the highest relative increase most likely due to more accurate coding within the time period, 68.2% of AIS were treated on SUs. 78% of hemorrhagic strokes were intracerebral hematomas (ICH; rather than subarachnoid hemorrhages [SAH]). Hemorrhagic strokes were increasingly treated on SUs (32.6% [2011], 37.8% [2017]). 68.8% of SAH were treated on ICUs (ICH:36.3%, AIS:10.3%). Early transfer in AIS increased (2.0 to 3.1%). Hemorrhagic strokes were associated with higher in-hospital mortality (SAH:19.6%, ICH:28.2%, AIS:7.3%). Interpretation The absolute increase of strokes presumably reflects the aging society and more awareness for cerebrovascular disease. The relative increase of AIS may be attributable to an increased neurological expertise. The increasing amount of early transfers in AIS reflects new specialized treatment options. Our findings reflect the need for structural adjustments in inpatient stroke care.","Eyding, Jens; Bartig, Dirk; Weber, Ralph; Katsanos, Aristeidis H; Weimar, Christian; Hacke, Werner; Krogias, Christos",Neurological research and practice,24,1

METHODS Clinical data and imaging studies of 93 consecutive patients treated at nine institutions from 1999 to 2015 were reviewed. We included newly diagnosed aortic coarctation (NCO), recurrent coarctation, and aneurysmal/pseudoaneurysmal degeneration (ANE) after prior open surgical repair (OSR) of coarctation. Primary end points were morbidity and mortality. Secondary end points were stent patency and freedom from reintervention. RESULTS There were 54 (58%) male and 39 (42%) female patients with a mean age of 44 ± 17 years. Thirty-two patients had NCO (mean age, 48 ± 16 years) and 61 had endovascular reinterventions after prior OSR during childhood (mean, 30 ± 17 years after initial repair), including 50 patients (54%) with recurrent coarctation and 11 (12%) with ANE. Clinical presentation included asymptomatic in 31 patients (33%), difficult to control hypertension in 42 (45%), and lower extremity claudication in 20 (22%). Endovascular treatment was performed using balloon-expandable covered stents in 47 (51%) patients, stent grafts in 36 (39%) patients, balloon-expandable uncovered stents in 9 (10%) patients, and primary angioplasty in 1 (1%) patient. Mean lesion length and diameter were 64.5 ± 50.6 mm and 19.5 ± 6.7 mm, respectively. Mean systolic pressure gradient decreased from 24.0 ± 17.5 mm Hg to 4.4 ± 7.4 mm Hg after treatment (P < .001). Complications occurred in nine (10%) patients, including aortic dissections in three (3%) patients and intraoperative ruptures in two patients; type IA endoleak, renal embolus, spinal headache, and access site hemorrhage occurred in one patient each. The aortic dissections and ruptures were treated successfully by deploying an additional covered stent proximal to the site of dissection or rupture. Two patients died within 30 days of the index procedure. After a mean follow-up of 3.2 ± 3.1 years, nearly all patients (98%) were clinically improved and all stents were patent. Reintervention was needed in 10 (11%) patients. Freedom from reintervention at 5 years was 85%. Two additional patients died during follow-up of coarctation-related causes, including rupture of an infected graft and visceral ischemia. Patient survival at 5 years was 89%. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular repair is effective with an acceptable safety profile in the treatment of NCO and postsurgical complications of coarctation after initial OSR. Aortic rupture is an infrequent (2%) but devastating complication with high mortality. Balloon-expandable covered stents are preferred for NCO, whereas stent grafts are used for ANE. The rate of reinterventions is acceptable, with high procedural and long-term clinical success.","Erben, Young; Oderich, Gustavo S; Verhagen, Hence J M; Witsenburg, Maarten; van den Hoven, Allard T; Debus, Eike S; Kölbel, Tilo; Arko, Frank R; Torsello, Giovanni B; Torsello, Giovanni F; Lawrence, Peter F; Harlander-Locke, Michael P; Bacharach, J Michael; Jordan, William D; Eskandari, Mark K; Hagler, Donald J",Journal of vascular surgery,24,16

The aim was to perform a systematic review of current evidences on clinical presentation of COVID-19, focusing on upper airway symptoms in order to help otolaryngologists identifying suspected cases. METHODS We searched PubMed and Web of Science electronic databases. RESULTS We included 5 retrospective clinical studies for a total of 1556 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 57.5% were male and mean age was 49.1 years. Pooled data revealed that pharyngodynia was present in 12.4% of patients, nasal congestion in 3.7%, and rhinorrhea was rare. No reports on COVID-19 and olfactory/gustative disorders matched inclusion criteria but preliminary evidences suggested they could be present. Common symptoms were fever (85.6%), cough (68.7%), and fatigue (39.4%). Frequent comorbidities were hypertension (17.4%), diabetes (3.8%), and coronary heart disease (3.8%); 83% of patients had alterations on chest computed tomography that were bilateral in 89.5% of cases. Ground-glass opacity was the most common finding (50%). Lymphopenia (77.2%) and leucopenia (30.1%) were common. Critical cases with complications were 9%, intensive care unit admission was required in 7.3%, invasive ventilation in 3.4%, and mortality was 2.4%. CONCLUSION Otolaryngologists should know that pharyngodynia, nasal congestion, olfactory, and gustative disorders could be the presenting symptoms of COVID-19.

For this reason, topical antimicrobial agent applied directly to the mesh is often used procedure. So far, however, this procedure lacks a scientific basis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two different meshes (Parietex™, Covidien; Ultrapro™, Ethicon Johnson & Johnson) were incubated with increasing amounts of three different Staphylococcus aureus strains (ATCC 25923; Mu50; ST239) with or without gentamicin and growth ability were determined in vitro. To further address the question of the systemic impact of topic gentamicin, serum levels were analyzed 6 and 24 h after implantation of gentamicin-impregnated multifilament meshes in 19 patients. RESULTS None of the gentamicin-impregnated meshes showed any bacterial growth in vitro. This effect was independent of the mesh type for all the tested S. aureus strains. In the clinical setting, serum gentamicin levels 6 h after implantation of the gentamicin-impregnated meshes were below the through-level (range 0.4-2.9 mg/l, mean 1.2 ± 0.7 mg/l). After 24 h the gentamicin serum levels in all patients had declined 90-65 % of the 6 h values. CONCLUSION Local application of gentamicin to meshes can completely prevent the growth of even gentamicin-resistant S. aureus strains in vitro. The systemic relevance of gentamicin in the clinical controls showed to be very low, without reaching therapeutic concentrations.","Wiegering, A; Sinha, B; Spor, L; Klinge, U; Steger, U; Germer, C T; Dietz, U A",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,24,12

In this setting, the order of treatment may impact the clinical outcome in this stroke subtype. METHODS Retrospective analysis was performed on data prospectively collected in 4 international stroke centers between 2013 and 2017. One hundred sixty-five patients with anterior TO were treated by endovascular therapy. Clinical and procedural data were evaluated. Favorable clinical outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤2 at 90 days. Propensity score matching was performed for different treatment strategies. RESULTS Patients' mean age was 65 ± 11 years and 118 were male (69%). The median admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 15 (interquartile range 8). In 59% of the patients (n = 101), the antegrade strategy (first stenting, then thrombectomy) was -performed, in 41% (n = 70) retrograde treatment (first thrombectomy, then stenting). Successful reperfusion (mTICI ≥2b) was achieved in 128 patients (75%). Fifty-nine patients (39%) showed a favorable clinical outcome after 90 days. After propensity score matching, data of 100 patients could be analyzed. Analysis revealed that the retrograde strategy yielded a significantly higher rate of successful reperfusion compared to the antegrade strategy (92 vs. 56%; p < 0.001). The rate of favorable clinical outcome after 90 days (mRS ≤2) was consistently higher (44 vs. 30%; p < 0.05) in the retrograde strategy group.

Several studies have evaluated this technique for orbital tumors. However, very few articles have focused exclusively on evaluating pediatric orbital masses and, within those, only a small number of patients were included in the study. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the use of DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values to differentiate between benign and malignant extraocular orbital lesions in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study included 73 patients under the age of 18 seen in our hospital between October 2016 and February 2019. The extraocular orbital lesions were evaluated clinically and radiologically using DWI. The diagnosis was confirmed by either histological examination (after biopsy or surgery) or based on clinical and radiologic evaluation. RESULTS The malignant lesions were found to have increased diffusion restriction in comparison to the benign lesions. The ADC values of the malignant lesions were significantly lower (P<0.0001). The use of a cutoff value of 0.99×10-3 mm2/s allowed for the differentiation of the benign lesions and malignant lesions with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 100% while the cutoff point of 1.26×10-3 mm2/s had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 73%.

Adrenal insufficiency carries the risk of serious, potentially life-threatening adrenal crisis. Our study evaluated the prevalence, characteristics and recovery of patients with underlying rheumatology conditions who had received prolonged glucocorticoid treatment. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated 238 patients, managed in accordance with current nationally and internationally accepted clinical guidelines. Data collected included patient demographics, historical steroid data, 09.00h cortisol/short synacthen test (SST) results and follow-up data on those with repeat assessments. RESULTS Overall, 65% of our cohort had a 09.00h cortisol <350nmol/l. On SST, 43% of patients demonstrated evidence of possible tertiary adrenal insufficiency. Prednisolone equivalent dose at time of SST was significantly higher in the group who failed SST versus those who passed; mean of 5.57mg versus 3.59mg (p= 0.005). 09.00h cortisol result correlated with 30-minute cortisol on SST (R2 = 0.20, p=0.002). 0-minute cortisol on SST correlated more strongly with 30-minute cortisol than 09.00h cortisol (R2 = 0.59, p-value <0.001). Patients with 0-minute cortisol >350nmol/L, all passed their SST. Patients who remained on prednisolone were more likely to recover (71%) versus those switched to hydrocortisone (27%), p= 0.02. Peak steroid dose was predictive of recovery; significantly lower in those who recovered (mean of 22.3mg versus 33.8mg, p= 0.03). Steroid duration was not found to be a predictor of recovery [recovery (64.2 months) versus non-recovery (55.6 months), p= 0.58]. There was no correlation found to outcome on SST with age, sex, peak steroid dose, steroid duration, underlying rheumatological condition, additional exogenous steroid use or serum sodium. CONCLUSION 43% of our patients demonstrated sub-optimal adrenal function on SST. Steroid dose at the time of SST was the only significant predictive risk factor for tertiary adrenal insufficiency. 09.00h cortisol demonstrated good correlation with outcome on SST and could represent a valid screening test to reduce need for SST if 09.00h >350nmol/L. Further prospective data is required to further characterise risk factors, predictive features of recovery and establish optimal management strategy of steroids (prednisolone vs hydrocortisone) to encourage adrenal recovery.","Sagar, Rebecca; Mackie, Sarah; Morgan, Ann W; Stewart, Paul; Abbas, Afroze",Clinical endocrinology,24,17

Social distancing and mask-wearing have been found to contain COVID-19 spreading across a number of observational studies, but a precise understanding of their combined effectiveness is lacking. An underdeveloped area of research entails the quantification of the specific role of each of these measures when they are differentially adopted by the population. Pursuing this research allows for answering several pressing questions like: how many people should follow public health measures for them to be effective for everybody? Is it sufficient to practice social distancing only or just wear a mask? Here, we make a first step in this direction, by establishing a susceptible-exposed-infected-removed epidemic model on a temporal network, evolving according to the activity-driven paradigm. Through analytical and numerical efforts, we study epidemic spreading as a function of the proportion of the population following public health measures, the extent of social distancing, and the efficacy of masks in protecting the wearer and others. Our model demonstrates that social distancing and mask-wearing can be effective in preventing COVID-19 outbreaks if adherence to both measures involves a substantial fraction of the population.","Behring, Brandon M; Rizzo, Alessandro; Porfiri, Maurizio",Chaos,24,6

The best delivery models and strategies for broadening access of the vulnerable communities are not fully known. This review identified PrEP programmes reported in the Asia-Pacific, which were classified by delivery models and assessed with a healthcare accessibility framework. METHODS We performed a literature search on PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE using relevant search terms, manual searched grey literature by visiting relevant websites, examined reference lists and contacted authors for clarification of included PrEP programmes reported through July 2019. A structured table was used for data extraction and summarizing findings in accordance with the five constructs of approachability, acceptability, availability, affordability and appropriateness grounded in the conceptual framework of Healthcare Accessibility. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION This literature search yielded a total of 1308 publications; 119 full texts and abstracts were screened, and 24 publications were included in the review. We identified 11 programmes implemented in seven cities/countries in the Asia-Pacific. A typology of four PrEP delivery models was delineated: (a) fee-based public service model; (b) fee-based community setting model; (c) free public service model; and (d) free community setting model. Overall, the free community setting model was most commonly adopted in the Asia-Pacific, with the strength to boost the capacity of facility and human resources, which enhanced ""approachability"", ""availability"" and ""acceptability."" The free public service model was characterized by components designed in improving ""approachability,"" ""availability"" and ""appropriateness,"" with attention on equity in accessing PrEP. Among free-based models, long-term affordability both to the government and PrEP users would need to be maximized to increase accessibility. Alongside the need for raising awareness, supportive environments and ensuring timely access were means for enabling the development of a sustainable PrEP service. CONCLUSION PrEP programmes could be classified by delivery models through the five constructs of healthcare accessibility. While the coverage of PrEP remains limited in the Asia-Pacific, an evaluation of these models could benchmark best practices, which would in turn allow effective models to be designed.","Lau, Janice Yc; Hung, Chi-Tim; Lee, Shui-Shan",Journal of the International AIDS Society,24,1

RESULTS The use of IL-17I was not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection [adjusted HR for IL-17I vs. methotrexate: 0.91 (95% CI, 0.48-1.72); IL-17I vs. non-systemic/non-immunomodulatory treatments: 0.92 (95% CI, 0.54-1.59)]. IL-17I was associated with comparable risk of COVID-19-associated hospitalization [adjusted HR for IL-17I vs. methotrexate: 0.42 (95% CI, 0.05-3.39); IL-17I vs. non-systemic/non-immunomodulatory treatments: 0.65 (95% CI, 0.09-4.59)] and COVID-19-associated mortality [adjusted HR for IL-17I vs. methotrexate: 7.57 (95% CI, 0.36-157.36); IL-17I vs. non-systemic/non-immunomodulatory treatments: 7.05 (95% CI, 0.96-51.98)]. In a sensitivity analysis, neither secukinumab nor ixekizumab imposed an elevated risk of any of the outcomes of interests. CONCLUSIONS IL-17I treatment does not confer an increased risk of COVID-19 infection or its complications in patients with psoriasis. Our findings support the continuation of IL-17I treatment during the pandemic.","Kridin, Khalaf; Schonmann, Yochai; Solomon, Arie; Damiani, Giovanni; Tzur Bitan, Dana; Onn, Erez; Weinstein, Orly; Cohen, Arnon D",The Journal of dermatological treatment,24,1

Although numbers of approaches have been proposed for this problem, most of which only consider mutual neighbors when aligning the cells without taking into account known cell type annotations. RESULTS In this work, we present MAT2 that aligns cells in the manifold space with a deep neural network employing contrastive learning strategy. Compared with other manifold-based approaches, MAT2 has two-fold advantages. Firstly, with cell triplets defined based on known cell type annotations, the consensus manifold yielded by the alignment procedure is more robust especially for datasets with limited common cell types. Secondly, the batch-effect-free gene expression reconstructed by MAT2 can better help annotate cell types. Benchmarking results on real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that MAT2 outperforms existing popular methods. Moreover, with MAT2, the hematopoietic stem cells are found to differentiate at different paces between human and mouse.

We studied the repurpose of genistein, which could prevent sickle hemoglobin from polymerizing under hypoxic conditions in this disease. Genistein an important nutraceutical molecule found in soybean. The present study examines the repurposing genistein as an anti- sickling agent. Genistein shows inhibition of Hb S polymerization as well as a sickle reversal. Also, we have explored the interaction of the genistein with sickle hemoglobin (Hb S), using fluorescence, far-UV-CD spectroscopy, MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST), FTIR, combined with molecular modeling computations. The quenching constant decreases with increasing temperature, a characteristic that coincides with the static type of quenching mechanism. Temperature-dependent fluorescence measurements and molecular modeling studies reveal that apart from the hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions also play a crucial role in genistein and Hb S complex formation. In silico, distribution prediction of adsorption, digestion, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/Tox) based on physical and chemical properties show that genistein is nontoxic and has ideal drug properties. The helicity and thermophoretic mobility of Hb S was a change in the presence of genistein, which leads to the destabilizing the Hb S polymer was examined using CD and MST, respectively.

How one starts with a question, formulates it into a hypothesis upon which a clinical trial is then built, is integrated with statistics and probability, such as determining the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when its actually true (type I error) and the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false (type II error). There are a variety of tests for different types of data and the appropriate test must be chosen for which the sample data meet the assumptions. Correcting of the type I error in the presence of multiple testing is needed to control the error's inflation. Within diagnostic testing, identifying false positive and false negative patients is critical to understanding the performance of a test. These are utilized to determine the sensitivity and specificity of a test along with the test's negative predictive value and positive predictive value. These quantities, specifically sensitivity and specificity, are used to determine the accuracy of a diagnostic test using receiver operating characteristic curves. These concepts are briefly introduced, with references to allow the reader to explore various concepts at a more detailed level if desired, to provide a basic understanding of clinical trial design and analysis.","Pugh, Stephanie L; Torres-Saavedra, Pedro","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",24,26

We need to understand the barriers and facilitators to receiving a future COVID-19 vaccine so that we can provide recommendations for the design of interventions aimed at maximizing public acceptance. DESIGN Cross-sectional UK survey with older adults and patients with chronic respiratory disease. METHODS During the UK's early April 2020 'lockdown' period, 527 participants (311 older adults, mean age = 70.4 years; 216 chronic respiratory participants, mean age = 43.8 years) completed an online questionnaire assessing willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, perceptions of COVID-19, and intention to receive influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. A free text response (n = 502) examined barriers and facilitators to uptake. The Behaviour Change Wheel informed the analysis of these responses, which were coded to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Behaviour change techniques (BCTs) were identified. RESULTS Eighty-six per cent of respondents want to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. This was positively correlated with the perception that COVID-19 will persist over time, and negatively associated with perceiving the media to have over-exaggerated the risk. The majority of barriers and facilitators were mapped onto the 'beliefs about consequences' TDF domain, with themes relating to personal health, health consequences to others, concerns of vaccine safety, and severity of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination is currently high among high-risk individuals. Mass media interventions aimed at maximizing vaccine uptake should utilize the BCTs of information about health, emotional, social and environmental consequences, and salience of consequences.","Williams, Lynn; Gallant, Allyson J; Rasmussen, Susan; Brown Nicholls, Louise A; Cogan, Nicola; Deakin, Karen; Young, David; Flowers, Paul",British journal of health psychology,24,5

PATIENTS AND METHODS A descriptive epidemiological study of 18 patients with COVID-19 in People's Hospital of Deyuan was carried out. Among these patients, 16 cases were connected with clusters (11 family-cluster cases and 5 public-cluster cases). The basic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and epidemiological characteristics of the patients were considered in the investigation. RESULTS The median age of the 18 patients was 44.5 years (37.5-52.0 years), and there were 10 males and 8 females in the sample. The main clinical symptoms were fever and cough. The epidemiological characteristics were as follows: (1) the median incubation period was 8 days (with an interquartile range of 4-12 days); (2) the incubation period in one case was ≥18 days; (3) one infant patient was asymptomatic prior to their diagnosis; and (4) two asymptomatic patients had a positive nucleic acid test after their family members were diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 can be transmitted in many ways, including via respiratory droplets and indirect contact, and it spreads easily among close contacts. People with a history of contact with areas affected by the disease should be isolated at home for 14 days. Moreover, attention should be focused on the issues of asymptomatic infectors, asymptomatic infants, and infants with mild symptoms.","Chen, G; Wu, M-Z; Qin, C-J; Wu, B-B; Luo, W-R; Liu, L; Liu, J-Y",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,24,1

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) was the predominant virus isolated, with serotype 2 (EHDV-2) representing 66% (135/205) of all isolated viruses. Viruses within the EHDV serogroup are genetically similar, but we hypothesized that subtle genetic distinctions between viruses would exist across the geographic range of the outbreak if multiple EHDV-2 strains were responsible. We examined viral relatedness and molecular epidemiology of the outbreak by sequencing the mammalian binding protein (VP2) gene and the insect vector binding protein (VP7) gene of 34 EHDV-2 isolates from 2012 across 21 states. Nucleotide sequences of VP2 had 99.0% pairwise identity; VP7 nucleotide sequences had 99.1% pairwise identity. Very few changes were observed in either protein at the amino acid level. Despite the high genetic similarity between isolates, subtle nucleotide differences existed. Both VP2 and VP7 gene sequences separated into two distinct clades based on patterns of single-nucleotide polymorphisms after phylogenetic analysis. The clades were divided geographically into eastern and western clades, although those divisions were not identical between VP2 and VP7. There was also an association between percent sequence identity and geographic distance between isolates. We concluded that multiple EHDV-2 strains contributed to this outbreak.","Crum, Jo A; Mead, Daniel G; Jackwood, Mark W; Phillips, Jamie E; Stallknecht, David E",Journal of wildlife diseases,24,24

Two environmental constraints were measured (area per player and number of players) to determine the relationship between these training design manipulations and density. Density was also compared with existing notational analysis measurements of pressure. Results indicated that a higher density on skills was associated with successful skill executions. The opposite relationship was found between notational analysis pressure measurement and skill effectiveness. A strong inverse relationship was found between environmental constraint manipulation and density, whereby increasing field size and playing number decreased the density on skill involvements. The findings offer insight into the continuous measurement of pressure and encourage practitioners to utilize training design manipulations to influence density as a constraint on skills.","Teune, Ben; Spencer, Bartholomew; Sweeting, Alice J; Woods, Carl; Inness, Mathew; Robertson, Sam",Journal of sports sciences,24,12

The infection of the nervous system by SARS-CoV-2 can occur via the nasal route through trans-synaptic pathways. Coronaviruses can infect neurons and glial cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors or by endocytosis. The infection of the central nervous system (CNS) with the systemic inflammation associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) leads to the impairment of the blood-brain barrier and triggers a neuroinflammatory response with reactive astrogliosis, and microglial activation.

This lack of resources poses challenges for training program leaders seeking to incorporate evidence-based climate and health content into their curricula. Climate change increases risks of heat-related illness, infections, asthma, mental health disorders, poor perinatal outcomes, adverse experiences from trauma and displacement, and other harms. More numerous and increasingly dangerous natural disasters caused by climate change impair delivery of care by disrupting supply chains and compromising power supplies. Graduating trainees face a knowledge gap in understanding, managing, and mitigating these many-faceted consequences of climate change, which-expected to intensify in coming decades-will influence both the health of their patients and the health care they deliver.

The authors propose not only learning objectives linked to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies for resident education, but also learning formats and assessment strategies in each content area. They also present opportunities for implementation of climate and health education in residency training programs. Including this content in residency education will better prepare doctors to deliver anticipatory guidance to at-risk patients, manage those experiencing climate-related health effects, and reduce care disruptions during climate-driven extreme weather events.","Philipsborn, Rebecca Pass; Sheffield, Perry; White, Andrew; Osta, Amanda; Anderson, Marsha S; Bernstein, Aaron",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,24,8

Variations among previous studies suggest task-specific effects of pain on the initial acquisition and subsequent retention of motor strategies. METHODS The present study assessed how acute pain in the anterior deltoid muscle affects movement accuracy of fast arm-reaching movements during force field perturbations, and upon immediate pain-free repetition of the same task. RESULTS Despite having slower initial rate of improvement, individuals who experienced pain during training achieved the same final performance as pain-free controls. However, pain altered the strategy of muscle activation adopted to perform the task, which involved less activity of the shoulder and arm muscles. Strikingly, motor strategies developed during the first exposure to the force field were retained upon re-exposure to the same perturbation, after resolution of pain. CONCLUSION Although reduced muscle activation may be interpreted as metabolically efficient, it reduces joint stability and can have negative consequences for joint integrity. These results demonstrate that alternative motor strategies developed in the presence of pain can be maintained when training is resumed after resolution of pain. This effect could have deleterious consequences if it applies when learning motor skills in sports training and rehabilitation.","Salomoni, Sauro E; Marinovic, Welber; Carroll, Timothy J; Hodges, Paul W",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,24,33

This increase in infection-related strokes is marked by atypical presentations including stroke in younger patients and a high rate of hemorrhagic transformation after ischemia. A variety of pathogenic mechanisms may underlie this connection. Efforts to identify synergism in the pathophysiology underlying stroke and Sars-CoV-2 infection can inform the understanding of both conditions in novel ways. In this review, the molecular cascades connected to Sars-CoV-2 infection are placed in the context of the cerebral vasculature and in relationship to pathways known to be associated with stroke. Cytokine-mediated promotion of systemic hypercoagulability is suggested while direct Sars-CoV-2 infection of cerebral endothelial cells may also contribute. Endotheliopathy resulting from direct Sars-CoV-2 infection of the cerebral vasculature can modulate ACE2/AT1R/MasR signaling pathways, trigger direct viral activation of the complement cascade, and activate feed-forward cytokine cascades that impact the blood-brain barrier. All of these pathways are already implicated as independent mechanisms driving stroke and cerebrovascular injury irrespective of Sars-CoV-2. Recognizing the overlap of molecular pathways triggered by Sars-CoV-2 infection with those implicated in the pathogenesis of stroke provides an opportunity to identify future therapeutics targeting both Sars-CoV-2 and stroke thereby reducing the impact of the global pandemic.","Kakarla, Visesha; Kaneko, Naoki; Nour, May; Khatibi, Kasra; Elahi, Fanny; Liebeskind, David S; Hinman, Jason D",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,24,20

In FY 2019, 26 percent of facilities earned positive incentives and 72 percent earned negative incentives, compared with 19 percent positive and 65 percent negative incentives in FY 2020. Larger, rural, and not-for-profit facilities were more likely to earn positive incentives, as were those with the highest registered nurse staffing levels. Although these findings indicate the potential to reward high-quality care at skilled nursing facilities, intended and unintended outcomes of this new value-based purchasing program should be monitored closely for possible program refinements, particularly in light of the disproportionate impacts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on nursing facilities.","Daras, Laura Coots; Vadnais, Alison; Pogue, Ye Zhang; DiBello, Michael; Karwaski, Christopher; Ingber, Melvin; He, Fang; Segelman, Micah; Le, Lang; Poyer, James",Health affairs,24,16

Even with mesh repairs, recurrence can be as high as 33%. Stapled Mesh stomA Reinforcement Technique (SMART) places a prophylactic onlay mesh in the trephine during permanent stoma formation to prevent parastomal hernia. Our study aims to describe the short-term outcomes of SMART procedures. METHODS A prospective study of patients receiving the SMART procedure from 2015 to 2020 was conducted. INCLUSION CRITERIA non-Crohn's colorectal and urological surgery with permanent stoma formation. The SMART surgical technique incorporates a 70-mm circular piece of polypropylene mesh by stapling it to the muscular abdominal wall using a circular stapler, and attaching the edge of the mesh to the deep fascia. RESULTS Fifty patients had a total of 53 SMART procedures. Median follow-up was 27 months. Procedures included: 35 end colostomies, five end ileostomies, eight ileal urinary conduits and five double-barrelled wet colostomies. Four patients had parastomal hernia during follow-up. One was acute, on day 1, due to very large size of trephine, one in a double-barrelled wet stoma that was repaired laparoscopically, one had a stomal prolapse requiring revision at 3 years and one patient had early small bowel obstruction due to very small size of trephine requiring another surgery. There were no wound infections or mesh-related sepsis. CONCLUSION Symptomatic parastomal herniation occurred in 8% of the study population, and most complications were due to incorrect choice of stapled trephine diameter. Longer term follow-up is required to assess for problematic parastomal hernia.","Chen, Michelle Zhiyun; Gilmore, Andrew",ANZ journal of surgery,24,22

Myeloperoxidase-specific antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) was positive. We diagnosed ANCA-associated renal vasculitis (ANCA-RV). Treatment was initiated with intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy, followed by prednisolone (PSL) at 30 mg/day. We gradually reduced the PSL dose to 7.5 mg/day over 6 months. At that time, the patient developed disturbances of consciousness which progressed subacutely. MRI revealed regions of patchy white matter with an increased signal on T2-weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences and diffusion-weighted sequences. JC virus DNA was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), leading to a diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a rare infectious demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by JC virus infection, occurring in highly immunosuppressed individuals such as HIV-infected patients and patients using some biological agents, and having a very poor prognosis. In the present case, PML may have been associated with steroid use, although there are very few case reports of PML in patients taking only steroids. We report progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy during steroid treatment of ANCA-RV. When patients show progressive disturbance of consciousness during treatment for ANCA-RV, we need to take PML into consideration for differential diagnosis.","Tawara, Takashi; Kai, Hirayasu; Kageyama, Mikiko; Akiyama, Tomoki; Matsunaga, Takahiro; Sakuma, Aki; Ishii, Ryota; Tsunoda, Ryouya; Kawamura, Tetusya; Fujita, Akiko; Kaneko, Shuzo; Morito, Naoki; Saito, Chie; Usui, Joichi; Yamagata, Kunihiro",CEN case reports,24,1

Eight ARBs are clinically available [azilsartan, candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan, telmisartan, valsartan]. Azilsartan (in some countries), candesartan, and olmesartan are orally administered as prodrugs, whereas the blocking action of some is mediated through active metabolites. On the basis of their chemical structures, ARBs use different binding pockets in the receptor, which are associated with differences in dissociation times and, in most cases, apparently insurmountable antagonism. The physicochemical differences between ARBs also manifest in different tissue penetration, including passage through the blood-brain barrier. Differences in binding mode and tissue penetration are also associated with differences in pharmacokinetic profile, particularly duration of action. Although generally highly specific for angiotensin II type 1 receptors, some ARBs, particularly telmisartan, are partial agonists at peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. All of these properties are comprehensively reviewed in this article. Although there is general consensus that a continuous receptor blockade over a 24-hour period is desirable, the clinical relevance of other pharmacological differences between individual ARBs remains to be assessed.","Michel, Martin C; Foster, Carolyn; Brunner, Hans R; Liu, Lisheng",Pharmacological reviews,24,24

Sometimes, unfortunately, these endeavours have been politicized and if these two approaches founder in any way or resistance subsequently occurs then the World will be left once again to the mercy of these devastating viral pandemics. This review therefore briefly outlines the challenges in development of vaccines and repurposed antiviral drugs which will hopefully lead to new treatments for COVID-19. It also concludes, however, that the armoury against COVID-19 urgently needs enlarging due to the potential severity and likely future reoccurrence of new emergent viruses. Therefore, serious consideration is given to alternative ways of preventing and controlling these pathogens that have received scant attention from the mediain the present pandemic.

Despite often being slow growing, they can lead to significant gastrointestinal complications including intestinal failure (IF). The use of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in neoplastic conditions is rising, primarily for palliation and bridging through treatments for cancer, but remains a challenging decision with a paucity of high-grade evidence-based guidance. METHODS A retrospective analysis of patients with NET on HPN was performed. Data collected included the cause of IF, complications encountered with HPN and changes in nutritional assessments. RESULTS Eight patients were identified, all with metastatic NET. Median weight improved following HPN commencement and line sepsis was the sole complication. All patients had stabilisation and optimisation of nutritional and hydration status. CONCLUSIONS HPN is commenced to improve or maintain patients' nutritional status during often lifelong treatment. The principle aim in providing HPN was to improve survival and quality of life. While NETs are cancers, our case series demonstrates the potential of HPN to actively support longer term survival in the subgroup of patients who develop IF.","Sagar, Vandana M; Shah, Tahir; Malhi, Hardip; Parkinson, Sharmalie; Shetty, Shishir; Cooper, Sheldon C",BMJ supportive & palliative care,24,20

In the present study, viral interference between two capripox viruses (sheeppox SPPV and lumpy skin disease virus LSDV in cattle) with Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) was investigated in vitro and in their natural hosts, sheep and cattle. A combination of SPPV/RVFV and LSDV/RVFV was used to co-infect susceptible cells and animals to detect potential competition. In-vitro interference was evaluated by estimating viral infectivity and copies of viral RNA by a qPCR during three serial passages in cell cultures, whereas in-vivo interference was assessed through antibody responses to vaccination. When lamb testis primary cells were infected with the mixture of capripox and RVFV, the replication of both SPPV and LSDV was inhibited by RVFV. In animals, SPPV/RVFV or LSDV/RVFV combinations inhibited the replication SPPV and LSDV and the antibody response following vaccination. The combined SPPV/RVFV did not protect sheep after challenging with the virulent strain of SPPV and the LSDV/RVFV did not induce interferon Gamma to LSDV, while immunological response to RVFV remain unaffected. Our goal was to assess this interference response to RVFV/capripoxviruses' coinfection in order to develop effective combined live-attenuated vaccines as a control strategy for RVF and SPP/LSD diseases. Our findings indicated that this approach was not suitable for developing a combined SPPV/LSDV/RVFV vaccine candidate because of interference of replication and the immune response among these viruses.","Safini, N; Bamouh, Z; Hamdi, J; Jazouli, M; Tadlaoui, K O; El Harrak, M",Scientific reports,24,1

Standard diagnosis procedure can be invasive and time-consuming. For these reasons, procedure called optical biopsy is introduced. This procedure allows in-vivo evaluation of bladder mucosa without the need for biopsy. Although less invasive and faster, accuracy is often lower. For this reason, machine learning (ML) algorithms are used to increase its accuracy. The issue with ML algorithms is their sensitivity to the amount of input data. In medicine, collection can be time-consuming due to a potentially low number of patients. For these reasons, data augmentation is performed, usually through a series of geometric variations of original images. While such images improve classification performance, the number of new data points and the insight they provide is limited. These issues are a motivation for the application of novel augmentation methods. Authors demonstrate the use of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) for the generation of images. Augmented datasets used for training of commonly used Convolutional Neural Network-based (CNN) architectures (AlexNet and VGG-16) show a significcan performance increase for AlexNet, where AUCmicro reaches values up to 0.99. Average and median results of networks used in grid-search increases. These results point towards the conclusion that GAN-based augmentation has decreased the networks sensitivity to hyperparemeter change.","Lorencin, Ivan; Baressi Šegota, Sandi; Anđelić, Nikola; Mrzljak, Vedran; Ćabov, Tomislav; Španjol, Josip; Car, Zlatan",Biology,24,1

Recent H5N1 avian influenza epizootics associated with sporadic human fatalities have heightened concern that a new influenza pandemic, one at least as lethal as that of 1918, could be developing. In early 2009, a novel pandemic H1N1 influenza virus appeared, but it has not exhibited unusually high pathogenicity. Nevertheless, because this virus spreads globally, some scientists predict that mutations will increase its lethality. Therefore, to accurately predict, plan, and respond to current and future influenza pandemics, we must first better-understand the events and experiences of 1918. Although the entire genome of the 1918 influenza virus has been sequenced, many questions about the pandemic it caused remain unanswered. In this review, we discuss the origin of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus, the pandemic's unusual epidemiologic features and the causes and demographic patterns of fatality, and how this information should impact our response to the current 2009 H1N1 pandemic and future pandemics. After 92 yrs of research, fundamental questions about influenza pandemics remain unanswered. Thus, we must remain vigilant and use the knowledge we have gained from 1918 and other influenza pandemics to direct targeted research and pandemic influenza preparedness planning, emphasizing prevention, containment, and treatment.","Morens, David M; Taubenberger, Jeffery K; Harvey, Hillery A; Memoli, Matthew J",Critical care medicine,24,16

Recent literature states that chatbots, if implemented effectively, could be useful tools for quickly sharing information, promoting healthy behaviors, and helping reduce the psychological burden of isolation. The aim of this project is to develop and test a secure and reliable computerized decision support system (CDSS) in web-app and evaluate its use, usability and its outputs in a pre-specified way. METHODS A multidisciplinary team was recruited to plan and design, based on the SMASS medical CDSS, the scenarios of the COVID-Guide web-app, a self-triage system for patients with suspected covid-19. The output data for the period May-September 2020 from Germany were analyzed. RESULTS During the period under review, the total number of consultations in Germany was 96,012. 3,415 (3.56%) consultations indicated the need for immediate evaluation, by activating the emergency service (calling an ambulance) - 1,942, equal to 2.02% - or by advising the patient to go to hospital - 1,743, equal to 1.54%. CONCLUSIONS Data seems to show good usability and a consistent number of consultations carried out. Regular use of COVID-Guide could help collect epidemiological data on the spread of (suspected) covid-19 cases, easily and quickly available in all countries where the tool will be used. Using the SSDC could help reduce the load on operators. Furthermore, the use of anonymous and geolocatable clinical data together with the generation of alerts and indicators produced by COVID-Guide could become a useful tool for epidemiological surveillance in the future phases of the pandemic (Telemedical Syndromic Surveillance).","Demurtas, Jacopo; Tonelli, Roberto; Celotto, Stefano; Veronese, Nicola; Lagolio, Erik; Rossi, Francesca; Clini, Enrico; Righi, Elena; Meer, Andreas",Recenti progressi in medicina,24,8

If presented on major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (MHCI), peptides containing these mutations could potentially be immunogenic as they should be recognized as 'non-self' neo-antigens by the adaptive immune system. Recent work has confirmed that mutant peptides can serve as T-cell epitopes. However, few mutant epitopes have been described because their discovery required the laborious screening of patient tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes for their ability to recognize antigen libraries constructed following tumour exome sequencing. We sought to simplify the discovery of immunogenic mutant peptides by characterizing their general properties. We developed an approach that combines whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing analysis with mass spectrometry to identify neo-epitopes in two widely used murine tumour models. Of the >1,300 amino acid changes identified, ∼13% were predicted to bind MHCI, a small fraction of which were confirmed by mass spectrometry. The peptides were then structurally modelled bound to MHCI. Mutations that were solvent-exposed and therefore accessible to T-cell antigen receptors were predicted to be immunogenic. Vaccination of mice confirmed the approach, with each predicted immunogenic peptide yielding therapeutically active T-cell responses. The predictions also enabled the generation of peptide-MHCI dextramers that could be used to monitor the kinetics and distribution of the anti-tumour T-cell response before and after vaccination. These findings indicate that a suitable prediction algorithm may provide an approach for the pharmacodynamic monitoring of T-cell responses as well as for the development of personalized vaccines in cancer patients.","Yadav, Mahesh; Jhunjhunwala, Suchit; Phung, Qui T; Lupardus, Patrick; Tanguay, Joshua; Bumbaca, Stephanie; Franci, Christian; Cheung, Tommy K; Fritsche, Jens; Weinschenk, Toni; Modrusan, Zora; Mellman, Ira; Lill, Jennie R; Delamarre, Lélia",Nature,24,16

Fourteen trained on the GI Mentor 2, 18 on the Endoscopy Training System, and 15 using the Surgical Training for Endoscopic Proficiency curriculum. Performance of male and female trainees was compared. RESULTS On the pre-training assessment, there were large differences between genders in FES pass rates (m 77%, w 15%, p < 0.001), total scores (m 69 ± 11, w 50 ± 12; p < 0.001), and in four of five FES sub-task scores (Navigation, m 73 ± 19, w 55 ± 22, p = 0.02; Loop reduction, m 34 ± 29, w 14 ± 22, p = 0.02; Retroflexion, m 81 ± 17, w 47 ± 27, p < 0.001; Targeting, m 89 ± 10, w 66 ± 23, p = 0.002).

Information about the different alcohol use patterns and their correlates among university students in sub-Saharan Africa is limited. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and cardinal demographic and psychosocial factors associated with specific alcohol use patterns among Ugandan university students. Methods a cross section study conducted over 5-months among university students using a standardized socio-demographic questionnaire screened for alcohol use problems, depression symptoms and academic stress using the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT), self-reporting questionnaire (SRQ-20) and the higher education stress inventory (HESI) respectively. Multivariate multinomial regression models were used to determine factors independently associated with a specific alcohol use pattern with low-risk drinkers as the reference group. Results a thousand out of 1200 students completed all study requirements for which 60% were males; median age was 22.3 (SD=2.36). The prevalence estimates of any alcohol use, low-risk drinking, heavy episodic drinking and alcohol misuse were 31%, 17.3%, 4.5% and 8.9% respectively. In comparison to low-risk drinkers, students reporting heavy episodic drinking were more likely to report high levels of academic stress (P-value <0.10).

The capacity to predict complications and early intervention can improve postoperative outcomes. In this proof-of-concept study, we used a machine learning approach to explore the potential added value of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and patient-generated health data (PGHD) in predicting post-discharge complications for gastrointestinal (GI) and lung cancer surgery patients. METHODS We formulated post-discharge complication prediction as a binary classification task. Features were extracted from clinical variables, PROs (MD Anderson Symptom Inventory [MDASI]), and PGHD (VivoFit) from a cohort of 52 patients with 134 temporal observation points pre- and post-discharge that were collected from two pilot studies. We trained and evaluated supervised learning classifiers via nested cross-validation. RESULTS A logistic regression model with L2 regularization trained with clinical data, PROs and PGHD from wearable pedometers achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.74. CONCLUSIONS PROs and PGHDs captured through remote patient telemonitoring approaches have the potential to improve prediction performance for postoperative complications.","Rossi, Lorenzo A; Melstrom, Laleh G; Fong, Yuman; Sun, Virginia",Journal of surgical oncology,24,8

Variable definitions, selection bias, mainly retrospective analyses of hospitalized patients and different methodologies are implemented in the research of this new disease. Central nervous system (CNS) pathology presents most frequently features of non-specific neuroinflammation with microglial activation and lymphoid infiltrations, ischemic/hypoxic encephalopathy, acute cerebrovascular disease, and microthrombi. Some brain specimens remain unaffected or show only non-specific changes of the critical status. Interpretations of the neuropathological findings are not always balanced in a clinical context and discrepant in consequence. Designing of longitudinal neuropathological studies, more frequent autopsies, and building of COVID-19 brain banks, together with neuroimaging analyses is essential. Genetic predispositions or immunological factors corresponding to the disease profile as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum biomarkers of COVID-19, the impact of different virus variants and influence of the therapy need to be identified. The mechanisms causing neuroCOVID and cognitive impairment - whether they are infectious, toxic, vascular or metabolic - create other aspects under research.

The frontal alpha-delta EEG pattern (seen in slow wave sleep) is widely held to indicate anaesthetic-induced unconsciousness. A priori we proposed that one responder with the frontal alpha-delta EEG pattern would falsify this concept. Methods Frontal EEG was recorded in a subset of patients from three centres participating in an international multicentre study of IFT responsiveness following tracheal intubation. Raw EEG waveforms were analysed for power-frequency spectra, depth-of-anaesthesia indices, permutation entropy, slow wave activity saturation and alpha-delta amplitude-phase coupling. Results Volitional responses to verbal command occurred in six out of 90 patients. Three responses occurred immediately following intubation in patients (from Sites 1 and 2) exhibiting an alpha-delta dominant (delta power >20 dB, alpha power >10 dB) EEG pattern. The power-frequency spectra obtained during these responses were similar to those of non-responders (P>0.05) at those sites. A further three responses occurred in (Site 3) patients not exhibiting the classic alpha-delta EEG pattern; these responses occurred later relative to intubation, and in patients had been co-administered ketamine and less volatile anaesthetic compared with Site 1 and 2 patients. None of the derived depth-of-anaesthesia indices could robustly discrimate IFT responders and non-responders. Conclusions Connected consciousness can occur in the presence of the frontal alpha-delta EEG pattern during anaesthesia. Frontal EEG parameters do not readily discriminate volitional responsiveness (a marker of connected consciousness) and unresponsiveness during anaesthesia.

We investigated the feasibility, clinical effectiveness, and cost savings of an ERAS program at a major U. S. teaching hospital. METHODS Data were collected from consecutive patients undergoing open or laparoscopic colorectal surgery during 2 time periods, before and after implementation of an ERAS protocol. Data collected included patient demographics, operative, and perioperative surgical and anesthesia data, need for analgesics, complications, inpatient medical costs, and 30-day readmission rates. RESULTS There were 99 patients in the traditional care group, and 142 in the ERAS group. The median length of stay (LOS) was 5 days in the ERAS group compared with 7 days in the traditional group (P < 0.001). The reduction in LOS was significant for both open procedures (median 6 vs 7 days, P = 0.01), and laparoscopic procedures (4 vs 6 days, P < 0.0001). ERAS patients had fewer urinary tract infections (13% vs 24%, P = 0.03). Readmission rates were lower in ERAS patients (9.8% vs 20.2%, P = 0.02). DISCUSSION Implementation of an enhanced recovery protocol for colorectal surgery at a tertiary medical center was associated with a significantly reduced LOS and incidence of urinary tract infection. This is consistent with that of other studies in the literature and suggests that enhanced recovery programs could be implemented successfully and should be considered in U.S. hospitals.","Miller, Timothy E; Thacker, Julie K; White, William D; Mantyh, Christopher; Migaly, John; Jin, Juying; Roche, Anthony M; Eisenstein, Eric L; Edwards, Rex; Anstrom, Kevin J; Moon, Richard E; Gan, Tong J",Anesthesia and analgesia,24,29

Unfortunately, the control of SpO2 in newborn infants is difficult. AIM To determine to what extent SpO2 levels match the ERC targets during the resuscitation of very preterm infants, and how well the SpO2 is kept within the high and low limits until the infants are transported to the NICU. METHODS In a single-centre observational study, the SpO2 and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) were collected during the resuscitation of very preterm infants with a gestational age (GA)≤ 30 weeks. RESULTS A total of 78 infants were included [median (IQR): GA 27(4)/7 (26-28(6)/7) weeks, birth weight 945 g (780-1140)]. During the initial 10 min after birth, large variations in SpO2 were observed with deviations above the target [median (IQR)] of 4.4% SpO2 (1.4-6.5), and below the target of 8.2% SpO2 (2.8-16.0). After the first 10 min, the SpO2 levels were respectively above and below the limit for 11% (0-27) and 8% (0-23) of the time. CONCLUSION During the resuscitation of very preterm infants, large deviations of the SpO2 from the ERC targets are observed. During the first minutes of resuscitation the deviations were likely caused by an inability to control the SpO2, whereas later deviations were due to weaning, pauses in respiratory support (i.e. intubation) and over exposure to oxygen. Changing the SpO2 targets to a target range that depicts the acceptable deviation might be helpful in providing better respiratory support.","Goos, Tom G; Rook, Denise; van der Eijk, Anne C; Kroon, Andre A; Pichler, Gerhard; Urlesberger, Berndt; Dankelman, Jenny; Reiss, Irwin K M",Resuscitation,24,20

However, bacterial infections remain a major concern during wound healing and tissue bonding. Hence, the development of bioadhesives with antibacterial properties is necessary. In this study, a hydrogel bioadhesive based on silk fibroin (SF) and tannic acid (TA) was combined with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) generated in situ during hydrogel formation to improve its antibacterial abilities. In this system, TA can be regarded as a phenolic glue molecule to spontaneously co-assemble with SF to fabricate the adhesive matrix network and also as a reductant to induce silver nitrate to form AgNPs evenly within the adhesive network. Furthermore, the influence of the amount of silver nitrate was considered. The produced hybrid hydrogel bioadhesives with different amounts of AgNPs exhibited self-healing capabilities, considerable wet tissue adhesion strengths (14.32 ± 1.85 kPa-28.80 ± 2.29 kPa) and good cytocompatibility. When the initial concentration of silver nitrate was more than 0.05 wt%, the produced STA bioadhesive showed effective antibacterial properties in vitro. These results demonstrate that these STA bioadhesives have the potential to be used in tissue/wound closure, especially when bacterial infections are a main problem.","Ke, Xiang; Dong, Zhiyun; Tang, Shuxian; Chu, Wenlin; Zheng, Xiaoran; Zhen, Li; Chen, Xingyu; Ding, Chunmei; Luo, Jun; Li, Jianshu",Biomaterials science,24,30

This has inspired new drugs able to decrease insulin requirements. For instance, human amylin (hIAPP) is a small hormone cosecreted by pancreatic β-cells with insulin to which is a synergistic partner. However, the high amyloidogenicity of hIAPP precluded it as a therapeutics and led to the design of pramlintide (sIAPP), a chimeric analogue with substitutions (A25P, S28P, and S29P) inherited from the aggregation-resistant rat isoform (rIAPP). Despite sIAPP advantages, it still shares with hIAPP a poorly soluble profile at physiological pH that hampers its mixture with insulin. Recent improvements, as charge-enhanced mutants, have been proposed. For instance, sIAPP+ was screened in silico by purely microcanonical thermostatistical methods and adds to sIAPP an S20R mutation to uplift its solubility. This suggests that such physically inspired computational approach may also be auspicious on devising effective coformulations of insulin with amylin analogues. In this seminal attempt, we make comparative multicanonical simulations of regular acting human insulin coformulated with hIAPP, sIAPP, or sIAPP+. To assess the respective physicochemical stabilities against aggregation, we characterize the structural-phase transitions through the microcanonical thermodynamic formalism and evaluate their time lags using the classical nucleation theory. These results are then correlated with estimates of solvation free energies, modeled by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, and structural propensities. Experimental essays are compared to our simulations and support our methodology.","Frigori, Rafael B; Rodrigues, Fabio",Journal of molecular modeling,24,16

The new pandemic influenza virus H1N1v2009 was feared to cause particularly severe outcomes. OBJECTIVE This study aimed at evaluating the impact of H1N1v2009 on the viral epidemiology, the clinical presentation and the severity of respiratory infections in infants. PATIENTS AND METHODS This prospective epidemiologic study included all infants <2 years of age, both inpatients and outpatients, presenting with respiratory symptoms, from November 2009 through April 2010, at the pediatric emergency department of the University Hospital of Caen, France. A nasal swab was taken for viral detection and analyzed by immunofluorescence and, if negative, polymerase chain reaction. Severe respiratory infection was defined by a score of respiratory severity. RESULTS One thousand twenty-one infectious episodes with a respiratory sample met inclusion criteria. Eight hundred thirty-four samples (81.7%) were positive. The viruses with the highest incidence were the respiratory syncytial virus (34.2%), the rhinoviruses (23.9%), the coronaviruses (9.3%) and H1N1v2009 (7.7%). Of all infections, 28.6% were severe and more frequent in infants with risk factors. H1N1v2009 infections had a low risk of severe respiratory disease (odds ratios = 0.15) and hospitalization (odds ratios = 0.40) compared with the other viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus infections had a high risk of respiratory severity (odds ratios = 7.85) and were responsible for 71.4% of admissions to the intensive care unit. CONCLUSION Despite the modest impact of H1N1v2009 observed in this study, further surveillance is needed to detect virological factors that may increase its severity.","Laurent, Carmen; Dugué, Audrey E; Brouard, Jacques; Nimal, Delphine; Dina, Julia; Parienti, Jean-Jacques; Vabret, Astrid",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,24,24

Agriculture continues to be most important economic activity in Pakistan and former FATA is no exception. However, agriculture in the semi-arid Khyber District continues to suffer a decline due to excessive reliance on rainfall, which is drastically insufficient. Khyber District have large expanses of fertile land; however, farmers depend on unpredictable rain-fed agriculture, which has low productivity and food insecurity. There are a number of rivers in the region where great prospects exist for irrigated farming. Geographical information systems (GIS)-based multi-criteria analysis can be used to map areas with irrigation potential. The current study focused on different variables including soil texture, perennial rivers, land cover, topography, and dams. For this study, data was collected from diverse sources which include Google earth images, top sheets, land use land cover, soil texture map of FATA, and SRTM 30 Meter. The collected data was analyzed by using multi-criteria analysis in Arc GIS 10.2.2 by using MIF technique. The results of this research indicate that there is great potential for irrigated farming in the study area. Potential land for this purpose were divided into three categories, i.e., highly suitable which consisted of 678 km2, or 26% of the total area; 1044 km2 representing 40% were moderately suitable to irrigation; while the remaining 698 km2 representing 27% were considered least suitable for irrigation. Likewise, 204 km2 representing 7% were deemed unsuitable for irrigated agriculture mostly consisting of barren rocks. The results also illustrate how GIS as a tool can be used in the exploration of water resources in a scientific approach, thus making decision-making easier and more accurate.","Waleed, Muhammad; Ahmad, Sajid Rashid; Javed, Muhammad Asif; Samiullah, Saifullah",Environmental science and pollution research international,24,16

This study presents clinical and laboratory data on 13 newly described cases from Australia (11) and the UK (two). OBSERVATIONS The disease was most often observed in middle-aged cats (median 7 years of age; interquartile range 5-9 years). Ragdolls (7/13) and males (9/13) were overrepresented. Cats generally had a long history of vomiting and/or diarrhoea. Lesions were typically large, hard, non-painful, easily palpable and most commonly situated near the pylorus or ileocaecocolic junction. Lesions were heterogeneous ultrasonographically and on sectioning at celiotomy or necropsy. Masses were hard and 'gritty' on fine-needle aspiration due to internal trabeculae made up of mature collagen bundles. Bacteria were commonly detected within masses (9/13 cases) using either culture or conventional light microscopy and a panel of special stains, and/or fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), although detection often required a diligent search of multiple tissue sections. A consistent bacterial morphology could not be appreciated among the different cases. OUTCOME Patients were treated with a variable combination of cytoreduction (debulking and biopsy, to complete surgical resection), immunosuppressive therapy and antimicrobial agents. Many cats had a poor outcome, which was attributable to late diagnosis combined with suboptimal management. It is hoped that suggestions outlined in the discussion may improve clinical outcomes and long-term survival in future cases.","Linton, Michael; Nimmo, Judith S; Norris, Jacqueline M; Churcher, Richard; Haynes, Sophia; Zoltowska, Agnieszka; Hughes, Sunishka; Lessels, Naomi S; Wright, Miranda; Malik, Richard",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,24,1

We aimed to investigate the clinical and radiological outcomes of treating recurrent sCA. We retrospectively evaluated the data of 52 patients with 60 recurrent sCAs who were retreated and 1534 patients with 1817 sCAs who received initial treatment. The primary outcome was a recurrence of the aneurysm. Secondary outcomes were an additional treatment, rupture after treatment, and a neurological worsening, which was defined as an increase of 1 or more scores using the modified Rankin Scale at 12-month. Safety outcomes included postoperative ischemic and hemorrhagic complications. We compiled the 120 (60 each) propensity score-matched cohort based on a propensity score for the treatment of recurrent sCA. In the propensity score-matched cohort, recurrence after treatment was observed in 25% and 6.7% of cases in the retreatment and initial treatment groups, respectively. The odds ratio of recurrence after treatment was 4.7 (95% CI, 1.4-15; P = 0.011). The secondary and safety outcomes were not significantly different between the two groups. This study showed that the treatment of recurrent sCA was a risk factor for recurrence after treatment but not for additional treatment, rupture after treatment, or neurological worsening. Although decision-making regarding the treatment varies depending on the institutional protocols and personal experience of the physicians, endovascular or surgical retreatment could be performed without hesitation.","Matsukawa, Hidetoshi; Tanikawa, Rokuya; Kamiyama, Hiroyasu; Noda, Kosumo; Uchida, Kazutaka; Shirakawa, Manabu; Yoshimura, Shinichi",Neurosurgical review,24,31

The Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV test is a leading influenza point-of-care test, but its evaluation has been limited to nasopharyngeal samples. In addition, the clinical impacts of Xpress Flu/RSV have not yet been quantified. METHODS We evaluated the performance of Xpress Flu/RSV at three locations in a UK Hospital Trust against an existing laboratory assay. Multiple upper respiratory tract sample types were included. In addition, we calculated time saved by Xpert, and the associations between Xpert use and rates of early patient isolation and antiviral prescription as recorded at the time of the laboratory result being telephoned out. RESULTS 642 patients were included in the diagnostic performance analysis. There were 177 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A, 7 influenza B and 86 RSV. For influenza A, sensitivity and specificity were 96.6% (95% confidence interval 92.8% - 98.8%) and 98.1% (96.4% - 99.1%) respectively. This was sustained across all locations and sample types. The negative predictive value was 98.7% (97.2% - 99.4%). The median amount of time saved was 27.1 hours. Xpert use was associated with six-fold higher rates of isolation and three-fold higher rates of antiviral prescribing by the time the laboratory result was available. Sensitivity for RSV was lower at 86.0% (95% CI: 76.9% - 92.6%). CONCLUSION Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV reliably detects influenza A infection and has significant clinical impacts.

Patients were matched for age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, and types of hernia. RESULTS Although operation time was comparable in both, the time wasted for scope cleaning was 8.5 minutes for conventional compared to 1.5 minutes for robotic surgery. CONCLUSION Robotic single-port inguinal hernia repair is feasible and efficient. This represents a further milestone in laparoscopic surgery.","Tran, Hanh",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,24,1

Children and adults show a different clinical course. The purpose of the current study is to comparatively analyze the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection in children and adults and to explore the possible causes for the discrepancies present. The medical records of 25 adults and 7 children confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV ARD were reviewed retrospectively. All children were family clusters. The total adult patients were differentiated into: the local residents of Wuhan, a history of travel to Wuhan and direct contact with people from Wuhan. The numbers were 14 (56%), 10 (40%) & 1 (4%), respectively. The median incubation period of children and adults was 5 days (range 3-12 days) and 4 days (range 2-12 days), respectively. Diarrhoea and/or vomiting (57.1%) were more common in children, whereas for adults it was myalgia or fatigue (52%). On admission, the percentage of children having pneumonia (5, 71.4%) was roughly the same as adults (20, 80%). 20% of adults had leucopoenia, but leukocytosis was more frequently in children (28.6%, P=0.014). A higher number of children had elevated creatine kinase isoenzyme (57.1% vs. 4%, P=0.004). Antiviral therapy was given to all adult patients but to none of the children. In summary, knowledge of these differences between children and adults will not only be helpful for the clinical diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but also for a future discussion on age-specific coronavirus infection.

Developing a computational framework that can learn from observational large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) and make accurate real-time predictions is a critical step. In this work, we develop and explore a Bayesian nonparametric model based on multi-output Gaussian process (GP) regression for hospital patient monitoring. METHODS We propose MedGP, a statistical framework that incorporates 24 clinical covariates and supports a rich reference data set from which relationships between observed covariates may be inferred and exploited for high-quality inference of patient state over time. To do this, we develop a highly structured sparse GP kernel to enable tractable computation over tens of thousands of time points while estimating correlations among clinical covariates, patients, and periodicity in patient observations. MedGP has a number of benefits over current methods, including (i) not requiring an alignment of the time series data, (ii) quantifying confidence regions in the predictions, (iii) exploiting a vast and rich database of patients, and (iv) inferring interpretable relationships among clinical covariates. RESULTS We evaluate and compare results from MedGP on the task of online prediction for three patient subgroups from two medical data sets across 8,043 patients. We find MedGP improves online prediction over baseline and state-of-the-art methods for nearly all covariates across different disease subgroups and hospitals. CONCLUSIONS The MedGP framework is robust and efficient in estimating the temporal dependencies from sparse and irregularly sampled medical time series data for online prediction.

Such measures are expected to have consequences on mental health. Aims In this study, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of quarantine-related anxiety and its socioeconomic correlates. Methods An online questionnaire was utilized to collect information about quarantine-related anxiety and related factors from a non-representative sample of Jordanian population in March 2020. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was used to ascertain the level of stress. Using STATA 16, multivariable ordinal logistic regression was done to estimate beta-coefficient (β) and corresponding 95% CI of the anxiety level. Results Overall, 5274 participants returned the survey. The prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe anxiety was 21.5%, 10.9%, and 6%, respectively. Female gender (β= 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.59) and more members of the household (β= 0.04, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.07) were correlated with a higher degree of anxiety, while older age (β= -0.27, 95% CI: -0.33 to -0.20), having larger social network (β= -0.17, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.13), social support (β= -0.28, 95% CI: -0.32 to -0.23), and higher income (>2000 Jordanian Dinars vs reference, β= -0.52, 95% CI: -0.71 to -0.33) were correlated with lower BAI scores. Conclusion Our findings showed that approximately four out of every ten participants experienced quarantine-related anxiety. Younger participants, women, and people with poor social support were more likely to experience quarantine-related anxiety. These findings highlight the importance of targeting these groups to mitigate the consequence of home quarantine on public health.","Massad, Islam; Al-Taher, Raed; Massad, Faysal; Al-Sabbagh, Mohammed Qussay; Haddad, Murad; Abufaraj, Mohammad",Eastern Mediterranean health journal = La revue de sante de la Mediterranee orientale = al-Majallah al-sihhiyah li-sharq al-mutawassit,24,1

In this single center, prospective, open-label pilot study, we randomized critically ill patients with bleeding risk who underwent anticoagulation-free CRRT, to commence with oXiris or M150 filter with sequential crossover. We examined the filter life with each circuit and its effect on systemic coagulation parameters. We randomized 11 and nine patients to commence CRRT with oXiris and M150 respectively, with 19 oXiris and 20 M150 filter-circuits in all. Patient profiles in both arms were comparable for illness severity and comorbidities. Median filter lives for oXiris versus M150 circuits were 13 h versus 18 h (p = 0.10). Among 11 patients with paired crossover filters, filter lives for 14 oXiris-M150 circuit pairs were 13 h versus 16 h (p = 0.27), and corresponding transmembrane pressures increased to 111 mmHg versus 75 mmHg by 12 h (p = 0.02). Patients' coagulation parameters were comparable following both filter-circuits. CRRT with oXiris (vs. M150) was independently associated with shorter filter life, adjusted for prescribed dose, vascular access, and coagulopathy. Use of oXiris did not prolong filter life over conventional membrane with no evidence of systemic heparin exposure; significant membrane clogging is observed by 12 h with oXiris.","Wong, Emmett Tsz-Yeung; Ong, Venetia; Remani, Deepa; Wong, Weng-Kin; Haroon, Sabrina; Lau, Titus; Nyeo, Hui-Qing; Mukhopadhyay, Amartya; Tan, Bee-Hong; Chua, Horng-Ruey",Seminars in dialysis,24,1

Despite its benign nature, the potential complications of pulmonary sequestration (PS) are significant, including recurrent pulmonary infections, hemoptysis, congestive heart failure, and malignant potential. Therefore, the main treatment is surgical excision, even for patients with asymptomatic PS. CASE We present an infant in whom an intralobar PS of the right lung and an extralobar PS of the left lung were diagnosed on prenatal screening ultrasonography. Both were found to have venous drainage into the portal vein. Surgical excision was performed via video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) at 14 months of age. CONCLUSION PS may present with unique vascular connections, including venous drainage into the portal vein. VATS resection for pulmonary sequestration is feasible and effective as an alternative to bilateral thoracotomies, in the setting of extensive preoperative planning and performance by an experienced thoracoscopic surgeon.","Parikh, Punam P; Tashiro, Jun; Chahwala, Veer; Perez, Eduardo A; Sola, Juan E",Journal of pediatric surgery,24,14

MATERIALS AND METHODS This multicenter, retrospective, per-nodule study was performed from 2007 to 2015. The study was approved by the ethics review board, and informed consent was waived. A total of 160/914 HCC nodules treated by thermal ablation and abutting large vessels (40 per treatment group) treated by monopolar RFA, MWA, cluster-RFA or mbpRFA were matched for tumour size, alpha-feto-protein level and vessel size. OLTP rates were compared by the log-rank test and the multivariate Cox model after matching. RESULTS No differences were observed in tumour size, vessel size or alpha-feto-protein levels among the three groups (p = 1). The cumulative 4-year OLTP rates following monopolar RFA, cluster-RFA, multi-bipolar RFA and MWA were 50.5%, 16.3%, 16.3% and 44.2%, respectively (p = 0.036). On multivariate Cox regression, vessel size ≥10 mm, monopolar RFA and MWA were independent risk factors of OLTP compared to cluster-RFA or mbpRFA. CONCLUSION Multi-applicator RFA provides better local tumour control in HCC abutting large vessels than single-applicator techniques (monopolar RFA or MWA).","Loriaud, Amélie; Denys, Alban; Seror, Olivier; Vietti Violi, Naik; Digklia, Antonia; Duran, Rafael; Trillaud, Hervé; Hocquelet, Arnaud","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",24,1

METHOD: The databases CINAHL, Medline, Embase and PsycINFO were searched for articles published between January 2008 and May 2018. Eligible articles were empirical studies that used Arnold's or DSM-5 criteria to diagnose skin picking disorder, published in English, with participants aged 18 years or older. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed according to the National Health and Medical Research Council's guidelines and suggested nosological classification of skin picking disorder were summarised. Eligible studies were assessed against the five criteria proposed by Blashfield and colleagues to determine the validity of the inclusion of skin picking disorder in the DSM-5. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies were considered eligible out of 1554. Most of the papers were case-control studies with small clinical samples. Only one out of Blashfield's five criteria was met; there were commonly accepted diagnostic criteria and assessment scales present in the literature. However, at the time of review, the criterion of 50 published articles (25 of which are required to be empirical) was not met; there had been no publication specifically assessing the clinical utility or validity of skin picking disorder and no studies addressing the differentiation of skin picking disorder from other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. CONCLUSION: Only a small proportion of published studies on skin picking disorder have employed validated criteria. The current literature fulfills only one of Blashfield's five criteria for the inclusion of skin picking disorder as a specific entity in psychiatric diagnostic manuals. Further empirical studies on skin picking disorder are needed in order to substantiate skin picking disorder as a disorder distinct from related disorders under the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders category.","Jenkins, Zoe; Zavier, Hyacinta; Phillipou, Andrea; Castle, David",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,24,27

Our primary outcome was arterial oxygenation determined by the PaO2 and PaO2 /FiO2 . The secondary outcomes were lung mechanics (peak airway pressure, airway plateau pressure, dead space, lung compliance, airway resistance) and postoperative complications. METHODS In this randomized controlled double blinded trial, 40 patients with an ASA classifications II and/or III who were diagnosed with moderate COPD and who were scheduled for cancer larynx surgery under GA were randomly allocated into two equal groups, the target (Mg-group) and control group (C-group). In the Mg-group, 30 mg/kg of 10% MgSO4 solution was administered intravenously for over 20 min as the loading dose, followed by the continuous infusion of 10 mg/kg/hr. In the C-group, the same loading and maintenance infusion rates were administered using 0.9% saline. RESULTS Unlike the C-group (baseline ""T0"" to post-infusion ""T1"" interval 294±97 vs 238±71 mmHg respectively, p=0.04 ±SD), the Mg-group exhibited preserved intraoperative PaO2 (T0 to T1 interval 271±89 vs 257±53 mmHg respectively, p=0.54 ±SD) and PaO2 /FiO2 (C-group T0 to T1 interval 404±81 vs 349±84, p=0.04 and Mg- group 394±91 vs 379±95, p=0.61, respectively), and these effects were modest. Further, compared to the C-group, the Mg-group exhibited lower airway resistance, dead space, airway plateau pressure, and peak airway pressure, and higher dynamic compliance. The postoperative PaO2 and PaO2 /FiO2 were higher in the Mg-group compared to the C-group. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative infusion of MgSO4 in patients with moderate COPD undergoing laryngectomy surgery under GA produces mild perioperative protective effects on both arterial oxygenation and lung mechanics.","Ahmed, Abeer; Sayed, Ahmed H; Elkholy, Jehan; Elshal, Sahar; Badwy, Abdelrahman; Abdelhamid, Bassant; Ollaek, Mohamed",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,24,16

Barbed sutures allow for knotless fixation, have been used successfully in other specialties, and may provide for more even distribution of tension along the length of the incision; however, data regarding unidirectional barbed sutures from randomized trials have raised important concerns about their use. Bidirectional barbed sutures offer a potential alternative, but have not been studied extensively in orthopaedic surgery. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES Using a prospective, randomized, within-patient controlled study design I compared wound closure performed with bidirectional barbed sutures in one knee of bilateral TKAs performed under the same anesthetic with those performed with standard sutures in the other knee to determine whether the barbed suture was associated with (1) faster closure times; (2) fewer intraoperative suture issues, such as needle sticks or suture breakage, and fewer postoperative wound complications; (3) no detrimental effect on clinical outcomes, including knee ROM and Knee Society scores; and (4) lower total operative cost, considering suture material cost and operating room time savings. METHODS Between 2011 and 2012, 50 consecutive patients meeting prespecified inclusion criteria with simultaneous bilateral TKAs had deep and superficial closures performed using interrupted and running standard sutures in one randomly assigned knee, and running knotless bidirectional barbed sutures in the other knee. The barbed suture is US FDA-approved for soft tissue approximation wherever absorbable sutures are appropriate. Intraoperative suture issues and the number of sutures used were recorded at the time of wound closure. Suture cost was compared between the standard and barbed sutures and measured against the operative time cost, as estimated per minute saved. Patients were followed postoperatively at 2, 6, and 12 weeks, and 1 year. Outcomes assessed included detailed operative and tourniquet time, knee ROM, Knee Society scores, postoperative complications, use of antibiotics, and any subsequent surgical interventions. These outcomes were assessed at each visit except for Knee Society scores which were collected at the 12-week and 1-year evaluations. All patients completed followups up to the final evaluation at 1 year. RESULTS Mean wound closure time was 4.7 minutes less using barbed sutures (SD, ± 2.8; 95% CI, -5.5 to -3.7; p < 0.001), average 16.1 (SD, ± 2.2) versus 11.4 (SD, ± 2.2) minutes for the standard versus barbed suture types, respectively. Overall tourniquet time was not different at 78.7 minutes (SD, ± 11.1 minutes) versus 74.9 minutes (SD, ± 10.1 minutes), respectively (p > 0.1). There were no intraoperative clinical issues, such as provider or patient injury, using either suture. There were no needle disengagements or suture breakages with barbed-suture closure; five episodes of premature disengagement of the suture from the needle and three suture breakages were observed with standard closures (p < 0.005). There were no postoperative wound dehiscences or disruptions of the arthrotomy closure with either closure technique. Final ROM was not different with the numbers available (barbed-suture group mean, 126.7° ± 6.9° SD vs standard-suture group mean, 125.6° ± 7.0° SD; p = 0.4, 95% CI, -3.77 to 1.73) between patient groups at 1 year. There were no differences with the numbers available in 1-year Knee Society knee scores (barbed mean, 92.8 ± 6.69 SD vs standard mean, 93.3 ± 6.2 SD; p = 0.6, 95% CI, -1.97 to 3.36). Considering suture material cost against time savings in operating room time, there was a cost savings of mean USD 175 per case when using barbed suture. CONCLUSIONS In this randomized controlled trial, I found knotless bidirectional barbed suture to be more efficient in terms of closure time and lower in direct operative cost than conventional suture material, while showing no difference in terms of Knee Society knee scores, ROM, or wound appearance with the numbers available. Future studies with larger numbers will be needed to compare overall costs of care and to detect uncommon complications that might arise, although none were observed in this small series.

Indomethacin nanosuspensions were prepared with small molecule stabilizers (sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and Dowfax 2A1 (DF)) and a polymeric stabilizer (hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC)). Two different drug:stabilizer ratios were used to evaluate the effect of micellar solubilized drug. The Ostwald ripening potential of nanosuspensions was evaluated by subjecting them to various stress conditions (temperature (15, 25, 35 and 45°C), thermal cycling, and mechanical shaking) for three months. The mean particle size increased in all SLS and DF formulations stored under different stress conditions. No effect of micellar solubilized drug on the Ostwald ripening rate was observed. In the case of HPMC formulations only those stored at higher temperatures (35 or 45°C) exhibited an increase in mean particle size. The increase in size in the HPMC formulation stored at 45°C was attributed to dehydration of the HPMC chains and subsequent loss of protection of the nanoparticles. The cube of the mean particle diameter versus time plot was determined to be non-linear for all formulations exhibiting Ostwald ripening. Therefore, according to the Lifshitz, Slyozov and Wagner theory the process was not diffusion controlled. The most probable mechanism for Ostwald ripening was surface nucleation controlled.","Verma, Sudhir; Kumar, Sumit; Gokhale, Rajeev; Burgess, Diane J",International journal of pharmaceutics,24,20

Response experiences shared by CDC deployed staff returning from West Africa were quickly incorporated into lessons learned and resulted in new activities to better protect the health, safety, security, and resiliency of responding personnel. Enhanced screening of personnel to better match skill sets and experience with deployment needs was developed as a staffing strategy. The mandatory predeployment briefings were periodically updated with these lessons to ensure that staff were aware of what to expect before, during, and after their deployments. Medical clearance, security awareness, and resiliency programs became a standard part of both predeployment and postdeployment activities. Response experience also led to the identification and provision of more appropriate equipment for the environment. Supporting the social and emotional needs of deployed staff and their families also became an agency focus for care and communication. These enhancements set a precedent as a new standard for future CDC responses, regardless of size or complexity.The activities summarized in this report would not have been possible without collaboration with many U.S and international partners (http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/partners.html).","Rouse, Edward N; Zarecki, Shauna Mettee; Flowers, Donald; Robinson, Shawn T; Sheridan, Reed J; Goolsby, Gary D; Nemhauser, Jeffrey; Kuwabara, Sachiko",MMWR supplements,24,1

METHODS Albino (Sprague Dawley-SD) and pigmented (Brown Norway-BN) rats were made diabetic by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg) following 24 h of fasting and diabetes was confirmed (blood glucose>250 mg/dL). Two months after diabetes induction, the integrity of blood-retinal-barrier in control versus diabetic rats from both strains was compared by using FITC-dextran leakage assay. Fifty microliter suspension of celecoxib (3 mg/rat) was injected periocularly in both the strains in one eye, 2 months following diabetes induction. The animals were euthanized at the end of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 h post-dosing and celecoxib levels in ocular tissues and plasma were estimated using a HPLC assay. RESULTS Diabetes (2-month duration) resulted in 2.4 and 3.5 fold higher blood-retinal barrier leakage in diabetic SD and BN rats, respectively, compared to controls. The area under tissue celecoxib concentration versus time curves (AUC) for sclera, cornea, and lens were not significantly different between control and diabetic animals. However, retinal and vitreal AUCs of celecoxib in treated eyes were approximately 1.5-fold and 2-fold higher in diabetic SD and BN rats, respectively, as compared to the controls. CONCLUSIONS Transscleral retinal and vitreal delivery of celecoxib is significantly higher in diabetic animals of both strains. The increase in retinal delivery of celecoxib due to diabetes is higher in pigmented rats compared to albino rats. Higher delivery of celecoxib in diabetic animals compared to control animals can be attributed to the disruption of blood-retinal barrier due to diabetes.","Cheruvu, Narayan P S; Amrite, Aniruddha C; Kompella, Uday B",Pharmaceutical research,24,20

There is still limited data comparing their respective long-term efficacy (>1 year). This study sought to compare the very long-term outcomes of AVNRT ablation using radiofrequency or cryotherapy. METHODS We retrospectively included all patients who had undergone a first AVNRT ablation in our institution between January 2010 and December 2017. The primary endpoint was recurrence of documented AVNRT. RESULTS The study population consisted of 409 patients (274 females, mean age 49.9 year-old). Ablation was performed using cryoenergy in 260 patients and radiofrequency in 149. High acute procedural success rate (> 98%) was obtained and no permanent AV block was observed using both techniques. During a mean follow-up of 3.3±2.3 years, documented AVNRT reccurence occurred in 24 (9.2%) and 4 patients (2.7%) in the cryoablation and radiofrequency group respectively. The risk of AVNRT recurrence was significantly higher in the CA group as compared to the RF group (Hazard Ratio = 3.7, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.9). Most of the recurrences after cryoablation occurred between 1- and 6-year follow-up (14/24; 58.3%), with 1/3rd of late recurrences after 3-year follow-up. In multivariable analysis, only Koch's triangle anatomical variant was associated with AVNRT recurrence after cryoablation (Hazard Ratio = 6.7, 95% CI 2.7-16.3). CONCLUSION While AVNRT recurrence rates were similar at one year of follow-up regardless of the energy used, long-term efficacy appeared higher after radiofrequency ablation. Strikingly, recurrences occured much later after cryotherapy compared to radiofrequency ablation. This article is protected by copyright.

Delirium may occur in the immediate period after anesthesia administration and surgery. Tropisetron, which is frequently administrated for postoperative nausea and vomiting, is also a partial agonist of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors associated with neuroprotective effects. Tropisetron may be the potential pharmacological treatment to decrease delirium after noncardiac surgery. Objective To perform a randomized clinical trial to determine the efficacy and safety of tropisetron for prevention of emergence delirium in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants This single-center, 2-arm randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will include 1508 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. The intervention group will receive 5 mg of intravenous tropisetron before anesthesia induction, and patients in the control group will receive a placebo. The primary end point is the incidence of emergence delirium within 1 hour after tracheal tube removal, measured by the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit score. The main secondary outcome is the incidence of postoperative delirium measured at 3 days of follow-up. An intention-to-treat principle will be used for all analyses. Discussion Delirium remains the most common neuropsychiatric complication for patients after surgery. This will be the first randomized clinical study to evaluate whether tropisetron is effective in preventing emergence delirium. Results from this study will provide evidence for alteration of daily practice.

This endemic genetic diversity fosters a rapid response to environmental change in mostly isolated local communities and, in particular, fosters the constant adaptation of ecosystems common to humans and farmed and wild animal populations and pathogens. During a 2-year study carried out in several mountainous regions of North Vietnam near the Chinese border, we surveyed 1697 breeders in 249 villages and gathered 5815 biological samples among the four main domesticated species of food animals: chickens, cattle, buffaloes, and goats. Serological analyses were carried out by ELISA on 726 sera in order to assess the prevalence of antibodies specific to two major diseases suspected to be present in the region: avian influenza (AI) and peste des petits ruminants (PPR). The results reported here reveal the presence of antibodies specific to AI, but not the H5N1 highly pathogenic strain, and the presence of antibodies specific to PPR, confirming that this disease, never previously described in Southeast Asia, is present in this region, with no mortality and little or no evidence of clinical cases. These are probably situations of co-evolutive epidemiological equilibrium between pathogen populations, which may have lost their virulence, and animal populations that have acquired genetic resistances over generations, either naturally or through genetic introgression from related wild species better adapted to such pathogens. These results suggest the need for more research, both short-term and, more globally, long-term.","Maillard, Jean-Charles; Van, Kiem Phan; Nguyen, Tung; Van, Thu Nhu; Berthouly, Cecile; Libeau, Genevieve; Kwiatek, Olivier",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,24,1

There is a critical need to better understand the landscape of non-vaccination in Michigan to assess the risk of vaccine-preventable outbreaks in the state, yet there is no agreed-upon best practice for characterizing spatial clustering of non-vaccination, and numerous clustering metrics are available in the statistical, geographic, and epidemiologic literature. We used school-level NME data to characterize the spatiotemporal landscape of vaccine exemptions in Michigan from 2008-2018 using Moran's I, the Isolation Index, Modified Aggregation Index, and the Theil Index at four spatial scales. We also used thresholds of 5%, 10%, and 20% non-vaccination to assess the bias incurred when aggregating vaccination data. We found that aggregating school-level data to levels commonly used for public reporting can lead to large biases in identifying the number and location of at-risk students, and that different clustering metrics yielded variable interpretations of the non-vaccination landscape in Michigan. This paper shows the importance of choosing clustering metrics with their mechanistic interpretations in mind: be it large- or fine-scale heterogeneity, or between-and-within group contributions to spatial variation.","Masters, Nina B; Delamater, Paul L; Boulton, Matthew L; Zelner, Jon",American journal of epidemiology,24,24

The questionnaire was prepared on Google Forms, disseminated through social networks, with questions about the socioeconomic profile and factors associated with isolation. A non-probabilistic sample was obtained with 16,440 respondents. Data were analyzed using the Stata 13 software. Social interaction was the most affected aspect among people with higher education and income (45.8%), and financial problems caused a more significant impact (35%) among people with low income and education. Those who practice some physical activity showed lower levels of stress 13%, as well as greater normality in sleep 50.3%. People who reported living in worse habitability conditions reported willingness to remain isolated for less time, 73.9%. Among non-isolated people (10.7% of the total sample), 75.8% believe that social isolation will reduce the number of victims of COVID-19. We conclude, based on this sample, that the perception about social isolation as a pandemic mitigation action varies by income, education, age, and gender. However, most believe that it is the most appropriate control measure and are willing to wait as long as necessary to contribute to the fight against COVID-19.","Bezerra, Anselmo César Vasconcelos; Silva, Carlos Eduardo Menezes da; Soares, Fernando Ramalho Gameleira; Silva, José Alexandre Menezes da",Ciencia & saude coletiva,24,17

METHODS Between 2014 and 2017, 42 patients (mean age 73.3±7 years; 26 men) underwent urgent TAAA treatment using the t-Branch stent-graft [18 in the early (2014-2015) period and 24 in the late (2016-2017) period]. Nearly half the patients were symptomatic (n=18) and 12 had contained rupture. Aneurysm diameter >80 mm was present in 12 (mean diameter 77.7±13.2 mm). Nineteen patients did not meet the IFU for the t-Branch due to target vessel anatomy. The primary endpoints were spinal cord ischemia (SCI), renal function impairment, and 30-day mortality. Target vessel patency and endoleak incidence were assessed at 30 days. Multivariate analyses examined associations between perioperative variables and outcomes; the results are presented as the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS The technical success rate was 93% (39/42). Successful catheterization was achieved in 150/155 target vessels (97%). The postoperative SCI rate was 21% (5 paraplegia/4 transient paraparesis) and was correlated with age (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.56, p=0.04). The renal function impairment rate was 23% (10/42; 2 temporary, 2 permanent dialysis) and was correlated with early experience (OR 7.74, 95% CI 1.3 to 43.9, p=0.019). The 30-day mortality was 14% (no intraoperative deaths); no factor was associated with mortality. During the first month, the incidences of type I, II, and III endoleaks were 0%, 43%, and 0%, respectively; branch patency was 99% (150/151). Procedure time decreased in the later experience (479±333 vs 407±25 minutes, p=0.09), though it was increased in cases outside the IFU (497±135 vs 389±118 minutes, p=0.009), along with fluoroscopy time (121±48 vs 92±33 minutes, p=0.036). CONCLUSION Endovascular repair of urgent TAAA using the t-Branch is a feasible treatment option with acceptable 30-day mortality and morbidity in terms of SCI and renal function impairment. Adherence to the IFU prolonged procedure time but had no effect on outcomes. Increased experience of such cases over time may improve outcomes.","Spanos, Konstantinos; Kölbel, Tilo; Theodorakopoulou, Myrto; Heidemann, Franziska; Rohlffs, Fiona; Debus, Eike Sebastian; Tsilimparis, Nikolaos",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,24,1

The Choosing Wisely Campaign was launched in wide variety of medical specialties and disciplines to reduce unnecessary or harmful tests or treatment interventions. METHODS The Choosing Wisely list for IBD was developed by the Canadian IBD Network for Research and Growth in Quality Improvement (CINERGI) in collaboration with Crohn's and Colitis Canada (CCC) and the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (CAG). Using a modified Delphi process, 5 recommendations were selected from an initial list of 30 statements at a face-to-face consensus meeting. RESULTS The 5 things physicians and patients should question: (1) Don't use steroids (e.g., prednisone) for maintenance therapy in IBD; (2) Don't use opioids long-term to manage abdominal pain in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); (3) Don't unnecessarily prolong the course of intravenous corticosteroids in patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis (UC) in the absence of clinical response; (4) Don't initiate or escalate long-term medical therapies for the treatment of IBD based only on symptoms; and (5) Don't use abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan to assess IBD in the acute setting unless there is suspicion of a complication (obstruction, perforation, abscess) or a non-IBD etiology for abdominal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS The Choosing Wisely recommendations will foster patient-physician discussions to optimize IBD therapy, reduce adverse effects from testing and treatment, and reduce medical expenditure.","Nguyen, Geoffrey C; Boland, Karen; Afif, Waqqas; Bressler, Brian; Jones, Jennifer L; Weizman, Adam V; Fowler, Sharyle; Halder, Smita; Huang, Vivian W; Kaplan, Gilaad G; Khanna, Reena; Murthy, Sanjay K; Ruel, Joannie; Seow, Cynthia H; Targownik, Laura E; Chawla, Tanya; Guimaraes, Luis; Fernandes, Aida; Saleh, Sherif; Melmed, Gil Y",Inflammatory bowel diseases,24,1

Target-controlled infusion (TCI) of remifentanil can reduce emergence cough effectively, and sex-related differences in effect-site concentration (Ce) of remifentanil have been evaluated in young patients. In this study, we determined the Ce of remifentanil for preventing emergence cough following extubation in male and female elderly patients and evaluated the sex-related difference. Patients and methods Twenty-three male and 22 female elderly patients aged between 60 and 75 years were enrolled. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil TCI. The Ce of remifentanil for preventing emergence cough was determined for each sex using isotonic regression method with a bootstrapping approach, following Dixon's up-and-down method. Results The Ce of remifentanil for preventing emergence cough in 50% (EC50) and 95% (EC95) of the population was significantly lower in females than in males. Isotonic regression revealed the EC50 (83% confidence interval [CI]) of remifentanil was 1.67 (1.55-1.83) ng/mL in females and 2.60 (2.29-2.91) ng/mL in males. The EC95 (95% CI) of remifentanil was 2.30 (2.02-2.62) ng/mL in females and 3.41 (3.27-3.58) ng/mL in males.

Although the etiology remains unknown, infectious agents could play a key role. The aim of this analysis was to examine the role of human astrovirus (HAstV) in infants with NEC. PATIENTS AND METHODS All patients admitted during a 5-year period at a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit with NEC (Bell stage I-III) who had examination of stool specimens for bacterial and for viral infections were included. Clinical data were reviewed and compared between infants with NEC and astrovirus detection (NEC + HAstV) and infants with NEC without astrovirus detection (NEC - HAstV) in stool specimens. RESULTS Forty infants with NEC were identified between 2002 and 2006 and 8 patients were excluded from statistical evaluation because of incomplete viral examinations. HAstV was detected in stool specimens of 6 (19%) of the remaining 32 patients with NEC. Double infection with rotavirus was identified in 1 patient. No other viruses were detected. Significant differences in patients with NEC - HAstV and NEC + HAstV were only shown for age at onset of illness (P < 0.001) but not for severity of illness, need for surgical intervention, or mortality. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that HAstV may be associated with the development of NEC in a subgroup of patients and provides further evidence for the important role of gastrointestinal viral infections in this most common gastrointestinal emergency in premature infants. HAstV should be included in microbiological examination of stool specimens in patients with NEC.","Bagci, Soyhan; Eis-Hübinger, Anna M; Franz, Axel R; Bierbaum, Gabriele; Heep, Axel; Schildgen, Oliver; Bartmann, Peter; Kupfer, Bernd; Mueller, Andreas",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,24,17

Our aim was to compare the sensitivity of pre- and postcontrast images of 3D double inversion recovery and conventional 3D T1-weighted images for the detection of contrast-enhancing MS-related lesions in the brain to analyze whether double inversion recovery could be as effective as T1WI. MATERIALS AND METHODS A postcontrast 3D double inversion recovery sequence was acquired in addition to the standard MR imaging protocol at 3T, including pre- and postcontrast 3D T1WI sequences as well as precontrast double inversion recovery of 45 consecutive patients with MS or clinically isolated syndrome between June and December 2013. Two neuroradiologists independently assessed precontrast, postcontrast, and subtraction images of double inversion recovery as well as T1WI to count the number of contrast-enhancing lesions. Afterward, a consensus reading was performed. Lin concordance was calculated between both radiologists, and differences in lesion detectability were assessed with the Student t test. Additionally, the contrast-to-noise ratio was calculated. RESULTS Significantly more contrast-enhancing lesions could be detected with double inversion recovery compared with T1WI (16%, 214 versus 185, P = .007). The concordance between both radiologists was almost perfect (ρc = 0.94 for T1WI and ρc = 0.98 for double inversion recovery, respectively). The contrast-to-noise ratio was significantly higher in double inversion recovery subtraction images compared with T1-weighted subtraction images (double inversion recovery, 14.3 ± 5.5; T1WI, 6.3 ± 7.1; P < .001).

Hence characterizing Mce1R is an important step for novel anti-tuberculosis drug discovery. The present study reports functional and in silico characterization of Mce1R. In this work, we have computationally modeled the structure of Mce1R and have validated the structure by computational and experimental methods. Mce1R has been shown to harbor the canonical VanR-like structure with a flexible N-terminal 'arm', carrying conserved positively charged residues, most likely involved in the operator DNA binding. The mce1R gene has been cloned, expressed, purified and its DNA-binding activity has been measured in vitro. The Kd value for Mce1R-operator DNA interaction has been determined to be 0.35 ± 0.02 µM which implies that Mce1R binds to DNA with moderate affinity compared to the other FCD family of regulators. So far, this is the first report for measuring the DNA-binding affinity of any VanR-type protein. Despite significant sequence similarity at the N-terminal domain, the wHTH motif of Mce1R exhibits poor conservancy of amino acid residues, critical for DNA-binding, thus results in moderate DNA-binding affinity. The N-terminal DNA-binding domain is structurally dynamic while the C-terminal domain showed significant stability and such profile of structural dynamics is most likely to be preserved in the structural orthologs of Mce1R. In addition to this, a cavity has been detected in the C-terminal domain of Mce1R which contains a few conserved residues. Comparison with other FCD family of regulators suggests that most of the conserved residues might be critical for binding to specific ligand. The max pKd value and drug score for the cavity are estimated to be 9.04 and 109 respectively suggesting that the cavity represents a suitable target site for novel anti-tuberculosis drug discovery approaches.","Maity, Dipanwita; Katreddy, Rajasekhara Reddy; Bandhu, Amitava",Molecular biotechnology,24,16

METHODS This was a case-control study during a 14-month period among children less than 2 years of age. Cases were admitted to the Baffin Regional Hospital in Iqaluit, Nunavut with LRTI. Controls were age matched and came from Iqaluit and 2 communities. Odds ratios (ORs) of hospital admission for LRTI were estimated through multivariate conditional logistic regression modeling for following risk factors: smoking in pregnancy, Inuit race, prematurity, adoption status, breast-feeding, overcrowding, and residing outside of Iqaluit. Viruses in nasophayngeal aspirates were sought at the time of each hospital admission. RESULTS There were 101 age-matched cases and controls. The following risk factors were significantly associated with an increased risk of admission for LRTI (adjusted OR): smoking in pregnancy (OR = 4.0; 95% CI: 1.1-14.6), residence outside of Iqaluit (OR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.0 -7.2), full Inuit race (OR = 3.8; 95% CI: 1.1-12.8), and overcrowding (OR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.1- 6.1). Non-breast-fed children had a 3.6-fold risk of being admitted for LRTI (95% CI: 1.2-11.5) and non-breast-fed adopted children had a 4.4-fold increased risk (95% CI: 1.1-17.6) when compared with breast-fed, nonadopted children. Prematurity was not associated with an increased risk of admission. Viruses were identified in 88 (72.7%) of admissions, with respiratory syncytial virus being identified in the majority of admissions, 62 (51.2%). Multiple viruses were isolated in 19 (15.7%) admissions. CONCLUSIONS Smoking during pregnancy, place of residence, Inuit race, lack of breast-feeding, and overcrowding were all independently associated with increased risk of hospital admission for LRTI among Inuit children less than 2 years of age.

The present systematic review aimed to synthesize and discuss the evidence appraising the neuropsychological tests used to assess ARCI in order to support clinicians and researchers in selecting appropriate tests for use with this population. Methods: We searched for studies investigating the psychometric, diagnostic and practical values of tools used in the screening, diagnosis, and assessment of Korsakoff's Syndrome (KS), Alcohol-Related Dementia (ARD), and those with a specific diagnosis of Alcohol-Related Brain Damage (ARBD). The following databases were searched in March 2016 and again in August 2018: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Psych-INFO, ProQuest Psychology, and Science Direct. Study quality was assessed using a checklist designed by the authors to evaluate the specific factors contributing to robust and clearly reported studies in this area. A total of 43 studies were included following the screening of 3646 studies by title and abstract and 360 at full-text. Meta-analysis was not appropriate due to heterogeneity in the tests and ARCI samples investigated in the studies reviewed. Instead, review findings were narratively synthesized and divided according to five domains of assessment: cognitive screening, memory, executive function, intelligence and test batteries, and premorbid ability. Effect sizes (d) were calculated to supplement findings. Results: Overall, several measures demonstrated sensitivity to the cognitive deficits associated with chronic alcoholism and an ability to differentiate between gradations of impairment. However, findings relating to the other psychometric qualities of the tests, including those important for the accurate assessment and monitoring of ARCI (e.g., test-retest reliability), were entirely absent or limited. Additionally, the synthesis of neuropsychological outcomes presented here supports the recent impetus for a move away from discrete diagnoses (e.g., KS, ARD) and the distinctions between them toward more broad and inclusive diagnostic conceptualizations of ARCI, thereby recognizing the heterogeneity in presentation. Conclusions: Based on the evidence reviewed, provisional recommendations for appropriate tests in each domain of assessment are presented, though further validation of most tests is warranted. Review findings can support efficient and evidenced-based test-selection and guide future research in this area.","Heirene, Robert; John, Bev; Roderique-Davies, Gareth",Frontiers in psychology,24,16

The variable that controls aerosol-cloud interactions in warm clouds is droplet number concentration. Global climate models demonstrate that the present-day hemispheric contrast in cloud droplet number concentration between the pristine Southern Hemisphere and the polluted Northern Hemisphere oceans can be used as a proxy for anthropogenically driven change in cloud droplet number concentration. Remotely sensed estimates constrain this change in droplet number concentration to be between 8 cm-3 and 24 cm-3 By extension, the radiative forcing since 1850 from aerosol-cloud interactions is constrained to be -1.2 W⋅m-2 to -0.6 W⋅m-2 The robustness of this constraint depends upon the assumption that pristine Southern Ocean droplet number concentration is a suitable proxy for preindustrial concentrations. Droplet number concentrations calculated from satellite data over the Southern Ocean are high in austral summer. Near Antarctica, they reach values typical of Northern Hemisphere polluted outflows. These concentrations are found to agree with several in situ datasets. In contrast, climate models show systematic underpredictions of cloud droplet number concentration across the Southern Ocean. Near Antarctica, where precipitation sinks of aerosol are small, the underestimation by climate models is particularly large. This motivates the need for detailed process studies of aerosol production and aerosol-cloud interactions in pristine environments. The hemispheric difference in satellite estimated cloud droplet number concentration implies preindustrial aerosol concentrations were higher than estimated by most models.","McCoy, Isabel L; McCoy, Daniel T; Wood, Robert; Regayre, Leighton; Watson-Parris, Duncan; Grosvenor, Daniel P; Mulcahy, Jane P; Hu, Yongxiang; Bender, Frida A-M; Field, Paul R; Carslaw, Kenneth S; Gordon, Hamish",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,24,8

During the COVID-19 pandemic, TikTok attracted many artists, who used the platform to take their practice, and thereby their self-marketing, into their own hands. At the same time, a new generation of collectors use TikTok to discover art under popular hashtag #feministartists. When artists label their work with #feministartists, they insert themselves into the gatekeeping process, and use opportunities and restrictions bounded to that specific hashtag.

Even though designers have had to work digitally to maintain workflow during this period, positive experiences were observed when using the special tools. However, the transfer of tacit knowledge was restricted in design projects due to limited spatial communication. While many designers discovered they could already use the available tailored tools, many improvements were suggested through needs that were previously unknown becoming explicit. © 2021 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

In this paper, we examine the potential systemic impacts of these activities in the Global South, using the Multi-Level Perspective from literature on sustainability transitions. We conduct a longitudinal case study of a non-governmental organization that has been pioneering distributed manufacturing solutions in the Global South for almost a decade. We illustrate that the pandemic is a major landscape event that is having profound impacts on the existing socio-technical regime and niche levels. We show how niches mature over time, and that the pandemic has created an opportunity for niche replication and alignment. We present an initial analysis of factors that support and resist the path dependency of the existing regime. Thus, we speculate about the possibility to transition away from a development model predicated on the transfer of products from the North to the South, to an endogenous model of sustainable development that is underpinned by local design and production in the South. Here we show that crisis creates a key window of opportunity for sustainable development in the Global South through the formation of distributed manufacturing networks. © 2021 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

By investigating these linkages, we aim to identify potential policy interventions that could affect some degree of de-segregation in the labour market and thereby reduce the gender wage gap. Using large, nationally representative labour force data samples of African workers, our findings confirm the existence of an earnings hierarchy reflecting a male dominance premium. Specifically, our results show that women working in male dominated self-employment experience the highest returns, followed by women employed in male dominated wage employment while working in female dominated wage employment and self-employment is associated with a wage penalty. However, trying to address wage inequality in the labour market through labour legislation is not likely to be effective if the wage gap is mainly driven by horizontal segregation. Our findings show that gender-based horizontal segregation of jobs is strongly correlated with gender-based segregation in the choices of post-secondary education. Based on our findings, we conclude that targeted training interventions for vocational qualifications of women in male dominated fields of study is likely to be the most plausible policy response that could reduce some of the differences in the earnings between African men and women. The negative economic effects of COVID 19 pandemic, which in South Africa affected women more severely in terms of labour market outcomes (Casale & Posel, 2020), may provide policymakers with a catalyst to challenge the constraints women face crossing over into male dominated jobs.","Roberts, Gareth Schöer Volker",World Development Perspectives,24,10

Studies have revealed high levels of depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. AIM: The main aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of psychological distress among the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, it aimed to determine the characteristics of highly susceptible population. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study using an online self-administered questionnaire gathering sociodemographic information and using the Kessler scale, which measures psychological distress. A total of 1058 people agreed to participate in the study and completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: The study findings showed that 48.6% (n = 514) of the study’s respondents were psychologically distressed, that is, either in the high or very high distress category. Significantly higher ratings of psychological distress were observed among female participants, younger adults, those who self-reported poor health status, single persons, students, and individuals with caring responsibilities, and those who have no access to a private outdoor space. This distress was also found among those who have been in close or indirect contact with an individual with confirmed COVID-19 infection, p < 0.05. CONCLUSION: Psychological distress has been widely prevalent among the general public in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Saudi government and the health authorities should pay special attention to the highly susceptible population and implement effective strategies to preserve and improve the mental health and well-being of these individuals.","Almanasef, M.; Almaghaslah, D.",Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences,24,16

He is a climate analyst at CARBON BRIEF, a nonprofit temperature and climate analysis group. He also states that changes there can help give us an idea of what the rest of the world can expect if we do not reduce the emissions that pollute homes and factories. Because of the high temperatures in GCC countries, the effect of heat stress is very high there, which discourages shoppers and pedestrians from shopping in the open area due to the physical exertion and high risks faced by people and workers. Heat stress peaks in most Arab Gulf countries from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. during the summer season. Heat stress is increasingly an obstacle to economic efficiency in these countries. This work designs and develops a robot that tracks shoppers and provides a cool stream of air directly around them during shopping in open areas to reduce the effect of heat stress. The robot enables us to cool the temperature around customers in the market to increase comfort. In this project, a robot was designed and manufactured to track a specific person and cool the air around him through a cool stream of air generated by the air conditioner installed inside the robot. We used a Raspberry Pi camera sensor to detect the target person and interact with a single-board computer (Raspberry Pi 3) to accomplish this design and the prototype. Raspberry Pi controls the air-conditioning robot to follow the movement of the target person. We used image processing to discover the target shopper, the control system, and then guide the bot. In the meantime, the robot must also bypass any potential obstacles that could prevent its movement and cause a collision. We made a highly efficient design that can synchronize between the software algorithm and the mechanical platform of the robot. This work is merely the combination of a cool stream of air and a robot that follows a human.","Abdelfatah, Mohamed Loreno Christopher Al-Rahimi Rashid",Electronics,24,1

Indonesia is an archipelagic country with many remote areas that lack standard laboratory facilities for COVID-19 confirmation, so sample transportation is necessary. The transportation method currently used is by using a cool box with ice packs to maintain stable temperature of 2-8°C. However, this method cannot ensure temperature stability in the cool box if there is delay in transportation. Therefore, a solution is proposed by making smart container for transporting viral samples called KONTRAVIR. KONTRAVIR is equipped with an electronic cooler which able to set desired stable temperature and maintained it within required interval. This smart container is equipped with a 24-hour temperature monitor with three indicators indicating safe, alert, and risky temperature conditions.

We focus on the setting where additional information about sample similarities is available and represented by a rooted weighted tree. Every leaf in the given tree contains multiple samples. Shorter distances over the tree between the leaves indicate a priori higher similarity in class probability vectors. We propose a novel data integrative extension to classical latent class models (LCMs) with tree-structured shrinkage. The proposed approach enables 1) borrowing of information across leaves, 2) estimating data-driven leaf groups with distinct vectors of class probabilities, and 3) individual-level probabilistic class assignment given the observed multivariate binary measurements. We derive and implement a scalable posterior inference algorithm in a variational Bayes framework. Extensive simulations show more accurate estimation of class probabilities than alternatives that suboptimally use the additional sample similarity information. A zoonotic infectious disease application is used to illustrate the proposed approach.

This call comes from the fact that from a health perspective, persons with disabilities have less immunity and are more vulnerable to deceases and infections. Many families of persons with disabilities have also expressed their concerns regarding the safety of their disabled member/s. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the impact of the new COVID-19 on the psychological and social adjustment of families of persons with disabilities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE The sample of the study was chosen randomly from the Asir region. The sample consisted of any member of the families of persons with disabilities (parents and siblings). Participants responded to a questionnaire, which was sent electronically via WhatsApp to the families of persons with disabilities. The questionnaire gathered demographic information about the disabled member from the family (age and level of disability). The questionnaire underwent statistical treatment to extract data for analysis. RESULTS The results showed less ability for families of persons with disabilities to adapt psychologically and socially to the spread of COVID-19. The findings revealed the existence of fundamental differences in the levels of psychological and social adaptation among these families due to the level of disability of their member and due to the variable of age, and in favor of the age group of 11-15 years. The study recommended providing safe methods of communication with families of persons with disabilities to reduce the feeling of psychological isolation and loneliness as much as possible during the quarantine or curfew periods. CONCLUSIONS This study explored the levels of psychological and social adaptation of families of persons with disabilities in the time of COVID-19. The spread of the virus created a crisis in different counties and millions of people were infected. Persons with disabilities are among the categories affected most by the infection of the virus due to their weak immunity and their health problems. Therefore, response plans need to take measures that cover the needs of persons with disabilities and their families.","Khasawneh, M. A.",Health Psychology Report,24,24

By analyzing the spatiotemporal distribution of the air quality index (AQI) values in Dongying, a city dominated by the petrochemical industry (specifically, petroleum exploration), during February 2020, when the strictest measures were in force, this study investigates the effect of short-term lockdowns on air quality. We observed a statistically significant reduction in the monthly average AQI—24.6%, or an absolute decrease of 25.4—compared to February 2019. Additionally, the difference between the maximum and the minimum hourly average AQI dropped to almost one-third of the value that in the normal time during winter. We also assessed the influence of meteorological factors and industrial exhaust emissions. Quantitative analysis revealed a strong positive correlation (p < 0.01) between the AQI and exhaust emissions, confirming the latter’s contribution to air pollution. However, this contribution shrunk by approximately 38.3% during February 2020.

Plasma volume status (PVS) can be estimated using formulae based on a patient's sex, weight, haemoglobin and haematocrit. Such non-invasive methods to assess congestion may be useful, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared the clinical value of two measures of PVS in a cohort of unselected outpatients with CHF (The Hull LifeLab). Methods Patients with an echocardiogram, N-terminal pro Btype natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) and complete data on signs and symptoms were evaluated (n=3505). CHF was defined as signs and symptoms of the disease and either left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) worse than mild, or LVSD mild or better and raised N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) levels (&gt;125 ng/L). Two formulae to estimate PVS were used: (a) Hakim formula (based on estimations of actual and ideal plasma volume calculated from weight and haemoglobin - H-PVS);and (b) Duarte formula (calculated from haematocrit and haemoglobin - D-PVS) (figure 1). Patients were split into quartiles of H-PVS and D-PVS. Variance inflation factor (VIF) was used to assess co-linearity between both measures and other variables. Outcome measures were all cause mortality, and mortality or heart failure hospitalisation. Multivariable Cox regression, Harrel's C-statistic and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) were used to assess the prognostic utility of each measure of PVS. Results Patients in the highest quartile (most congested) of DPVS or H-PVS had higher NTproBNP levels, were more likely to have severe symptoms and signs, and be prescribed a loop diuretic than those in lower quartiles (table 1 and 2). Patients in the highest quartile paradoxically weighed much less than those in those lowest quartiles. H-PVS and D-PVS were strongly correlated with one another (r=0.79;P&lt;0.001) but had only modest positive correlations with log[NTproBNP] (r=0.32 and r=0.24 respectively;P&lt;0.001). There was extreme co-linearity between D-PVS and haemoglobin in linear regression models with other continuous variables (VIF = 14). Higher H-PVS (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.00 - 1.02);P=0.002) or D-PVS (HR = 1.08 (95% CI = 1.03 - 1.14);P=0.002) was associated with greater risk of all-cause mortality or hospitalisation with heart failure. Neither the Harrel's C-statistic nor AIC of outcome models for 1 year mortality including either weight or haemoglobin were improved by the addition of H-PVS or D-PVS (figure 2). Conclusions Changes in weight or haemoglobin in patients with CHF are not always due to changes in plasma volume. Despite apparent associations with disease severity, H-PVS and D-PVS are just surrogates of the variables from which they are calculated and not reliable measures of congestion. It is likely neither has any clinical utility.","Cuthbert, J.",Heart,24,5

We conducted a single-case analysis focusing on Zong-Teng Group, one of the biggest cross-border e-commerce enterprises in China, as our sample. Data were mainly collected from interviews with Zong-Teng managers and public online resources. Through case analysis, this paper identifies that a fit between the information processing requirements of a firm and its information processing capability leads to greater ambidexterity for exploitation and exploration, which in turn improves supply chain resilience (SCR) in the form of agility, redundancy and flexibility. In addition, ambidexterity in terms of morality improves SCR culture. This paper may be the first to adopt information processing theory to examine SCR and consider the role of ambidexterity, noting that crises such as COVID-19 impose an exponential increase in information processing requirements, to which many firms fail to respond effectively.","Wang, Y.; Yan, F.

It uses wastewater SARS-CoV-2 data collected from 394 sampling sites, and implements normalisation based on concentrations of a) ammoniacal nitrogen, and b) orthophosphate. Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 metrics are evaluated at a site and aggregated level against three indicators prevalence, based on positivity rates from the Office for National Statistics Coronavirus Infection Survey and test results reported by NHS Test and Trace. Normalisation is shown to have little impact on the overall trends in the wastewater SARS-CoV-2 data on average. However, significant variability between the impact of population normalisation at different sites, which is not evident from previous WBE studies focussed on a single site, is also revealed. Critically, it is demonstrated that while the impact of normalisation on SARS-CoV-2 trends is small on average, it is not reasonable to conclude that it is always insignificant. When averaged across many sites, normalisation strengthens the correlation between wastewater SARS-CoV-2 data and indicators of prevalence; however, confidence in the improvement is low. Lastly, it is noted that most data were collected during periods of national lockdown and/or local restrictions, and thus the impacts and benefits of population normalisation are expected to be higher when normal travel habits resume.","Sweetapple, C.; Wade, M.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has increased stress for everyone, but particularly adolescents who face unique stressors such as restrictions in socialization and education. However, variability in brain processes supporting stress reactivity is not well understood. Here, we leverage pre-pandemic brain development studies to identify how maturity of prefrontal connectivity with the amygdala (AMY) and hippocampus (HPC) is associated with response to COVID-19. We hypothesized that age-related change in connectivity of affective and cognitive brain systems may underlie the emotional response of adolescents during the pandemic. Methods 111 10-31 year olds completed resting state fMRI scans prior to the pandemic and then completed a questionnaire nine months into the pandemic measuring worry, COVID-related stress, sadness, perceived stress, and positive affect. Associations between pairwise functional connectivity of HPC/AMY subregions with prefrontal cortex (PFC) subdivisions and affective reactivity during the pandemic were examined. Results Regression analyses indicated that both worry and COVID-related stress increased with age (p &lt; 0.05 FDR corrected). Furthermore, greater connectivity between anterior ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) and posterior HPC (pHPC) was associated with greater worry and COVID-related stress (p &lt; 0.05 FDR corrected), which was primarily driven by individuals under 18. Conclusion Taken together, our results indicate that increases in stress reactivity to the COVID-19 pandemic across the transition to adulthood are driven by maturation of pHPC-vmPFC coupling, which integrates stress response and emotional memory processing.","Perica, Maria I.; Ravindranath, Orma Calabro Finnegan J.; Foran, William Luna Beatriz",Biological Psychiatry Global Open Science,24,5

At doses at which the wild-type virus would be fatal, the mutants with gene deletions did not cause any clinical symptoms. They still induced an immune response, however, as judged from the high levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies. The FIP virus (FIPV) mutant lacking the 3abc cluster and, to a lesser extent, the mutant missing the 7ab cluster, protected cats against a lethal homologous challenge; no protection was obtained with the mutant devoid of both gene clusters.

Clinical and laboratory features and outcomes were recorded on a structured proforma. Results During the study period 34 cases of MIS-C and 83 cases of Dengue fever were enrolled. Mean age of MIS-C cases (male, 86.3%) was 7.89 (4.61) years. Of 34 cases, MIS-C with shock was seen in 15 cases (44%), MIS-C without shock, 17 cases (50%) and Kawasaki disease-like presentation in 2 cases (6%). Patients of MIS-C were younger as compared to dengue fever (P=0.002). Conjunctival injection and swelling of hand and feet were more commonly seen in MIS-C. Abdominal pain and erythematous rash were more common in dengue fever. Of the inflammatory markers, mean C reactive protein was higher in MIS-C patients, than dengue fever patients [100.2 (85.1) vs 16.9 (29.3) mg/dL (P<0.001). In contrast, serum ferritin levels were higher in dengue fever patients (P=0.03). Need for mechanical ventilation was significantly more in MIS-C cases.

The innate immune system uses multiple families of germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect infection and trigger a variety of antimicrobial defense mechanisms. PRRs are evolutionarily highly conserved and serve to detect infection by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns that are unique to microorganisms and essential for their survival. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are transmembrane signalling receptors that activate gene expression programs that result in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, type I interferons and antimicrobial factors. Furthermore, TLR activation facilitates and guides activation of adaptive immune responses through the activation of dendritic cells. TLRs are localized on the cell surface and in endosomal/lysosomal compartments, where they detect bacterial and viral infections. In contrast, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain proteins and RNA helicases are located in the cell cytoplasm, where they serve as intracellular PRRs to detect cytoplasmic infections, particularly viruses. Due to their ability to enhance innate immune responses, novel strategies to use ligands, synthetic agonists or antagonists of PRRs (also known as 'innate immunologicals') can be used as stand-alone agents to provide immediate protection or treatment against bacterial, viral or parasitic infections. Furthermore, the newly appreciated importance of innate immunity in initiating and shaping adaptive immune responses is contributing to our understanding of vaccine adjuvants and promises to lead to improved next-generation vaccines.","Rosenthal, Kenneth L",The Canadian journal of infectious diseases & medical microbiology = Journal canadien des maladies infectieuses et de la microbiologie medicale,24,9

Here, we propose a new procedure, the ""preperitoneal cavity suction technique,"" to confirm mesh position during LIHR under a transabdominal preperitoneal approach (TAPP). PATIENTS AND METHODS We developed the ""preperitoneal cavity suction technique"" during LIHR by TAPP, visualizing the mesh through the closed peritoneum by vacuuming up the carbon dioxide and effusion at the preperitoneal cavity using a suction tube inserted through the tunnel from a laterally placed trocar into the preperitoneal space. We applied this technique in adults with inguinal hernias who were scheduled to undergo elective surgery in our hospital between April 2013 and March 2015. RESULTS In total, 84 lesions were treated in 74 consecutive LIHRs by TAPP. The ""preperitoneal cavity suction technique"" was applied to 83 lesions. We confirmed appropriate positioning of the mesh for 82 of the 83 lesions (98.8%), with dislocation of the mesh detected in 1 case. In that case, we reopened the peritoneal flap and repositioned the mesh correctly during the operation. No patients complained of pain or a sense of discomfort, and no hematoma was identified around the dissected area or anterior superior iliac spine on the affected side. Mean duration of hospitalization was 2.5 days. No cases of hernia recurrence were observed during follow-up (range, 7 to 31 mo; median, 15 mo).

Until recently, only a few specialized centers offered TEM in the United States, where it is now gaining popularity. Many hospitals have purchased equipment and are offering TEM; however, the equipment is expensive and the learning curve is steep. Therefore, it is essential that anyone performing TEM have an adequate number of cases to develop and maintain expertise in this technique. That being said, TEM remains unique when compared with laparoscopy and other minimally invasive techniques that incorporate less invasive methods of performing old operations. TEM allows surgeons to perform operations that were impossible before the development and acceptance of this technique.","Cataldo, Peter A",The Surgical clinics of North America,24,19

Alternatively, disease may function as a competing risk factor, for example, killing already moribund hosts. Using tuberculosis (TB) in African buffalo as a model system, we explore consequences of competing or independent disease effects for host population dynamics. We include scenarios with density-dependent and density-independent effects of environmental variation, exemplified by variable food availability (driven by rainfall) and catastrophic droughts, respectively. Independent disease effects reduce population size linearly with prevalence, irrespective of the nature of environmental variation. Competing disease risks alter population size only if density-independent variation is present; then, disease reduces population size nonlinearly. Field data indicate that the net effect of TB on buffalo likely falls between the extremes of total independence and competition with other risk factors: TB increases mortality and decreases fecundity in some prime-aged buffalo, suggesting independent disease risks in these individuals, while similar disease effects in senescent buffalo may act as competing risks. Moreover, increased survival and fecundity of TB-negative buffalo may compensate for some disease-related losses. Model assumptions on independent or competing disease risks and environmental variability should be considered explicitly when assessing disease effects on wildlife populations.","Jolles, Anna E; Etienne, Rampal S; Olff, Han",The American naturalist,24,16

The aim of this study was to evaluate evolution tendency of the H3 gene in a long period of time. METHODS 1842 H3 HA1 nucleotide strains of different hosts were collected for analysis. A two-step clustering method was used to divide strains into groups, and then a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on cluster results. Evolution rate in lineages were future estimated. RESULTS Tree structure showed three lineages: horse/canine, human/swine and avian. As a single trunk, the human/swine lineage was mainly composed of human strains, and more big branches appeared in recent years. Tree topology showed no evidence that swine affected the main evolution tendency of human H3 strains. The evolution rate of H3 strains varied between lineages. We observed that the rate in the human lineage decreased from 3.2 substitutions/year before 1980 to 1.8 after 1997. CONCLUSION We concluded that the variation of human H3 gene was associated with swine strains but independent of others, including bird strains. The evolution rate of human H3 strains seems to have decreased in recent years, while the reasons for the rate change need to be further explored.","Zhang, Wentong; Jiang, Qingwu; Chen, Yue",Intervirology,24,16

METHODS Recombination vectors with sense and antisense pXJ41-cyclinD1 and pXJ41-CDK4 were constructed, and then transfected into the malignant transformed cells induced by silica, respectively. At the same time, pXJ41-neo was used as the control. RESULTS During the progress of the malignant transformation of 2BS cells induced by silica, cyclinD1 and CDK4 were overexpressed. Antisense RNA suppressed cyclinD1 and CDK4 gene expression in the antisense pXJ41-cyclinD1 and pXJ41-CDK4 transfected cells. Antisense RNA led to cell cycle arrest, resulting in lengthened G1 phase (the percentages of cells in the G1 phase changed from 45.1% to 52.7% and 58.0% for cyclinD1 and CDK4 transfected cells, respectively), and eventually attenuated the increase of the proliferation of malignant transformed cells induced by silica. Compared with malignant transformed cells induced by silica, cells transfected with antisense pXJ41-cyclinD1 and pXJ41-CDK4 showed obviously reduced growth rates. On the 8th day, the suppression rates were 58.69 and 77.43% (the growth rate of malignant transformed cells induced by silica was 100%), doubling time changed from 21.0 h to 31.4 h and 21.0 h to 42.7 h, respectively, the growth capacities on soft agar of cells transfected by antisense pXJ41-cyclinD1 and pXJ41-CDK4 decreased obviously.

One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and development. OBJECTIVE: This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify differences in the responses of different professional groups. METHODS: This survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups. RESULTS: In total, 86 of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI.

However, the nutritional status of COVID-19 patients has not yet been extensively examined. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the nutritional status of COVID-19 patients and to identify factors independently associated with malnutrition risk. METHODS: In this single-center, cross-sectional study, we analyzed data from 760 hospitalized COVID-19 patients between 29 January 2020 and 15 March 2020. Based on the Nutrition Risk Screening (NRS) 2002 score, we divided patients into the normal nutrition group (NRS score <3) and the malnutrition risk group (NRS score &#8805;3). The associations of age, gender, symptoms, comorbidities, BMI, serum albumin and prealbumin concentrations, disease severity, activities of daily living (ADL) score, and clinical outcomes with malnutrition risk were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent factors associated with malnutrition risk. RESULTS: Of patients with COVID-19, 82.6% were at risk of malnutrition. There were statistical differences in the age, incidence of fever, BMI, serum albumin and prealbumin concentrations, ADL score, and disease severity between the 2 groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that age &#8805;65 y (vs. <65 y; OR: 5.40; P < 0.001), serum albumin <35 g/L (vs. &#8805;35 g/L; OR: 3.61; P < 0.001), serum prealbumin <150 mg/L (vs. &#8805;150 mg/L; OR: 2.88; P = 0.042), critical cases (vs. moderate cases; OR: 4.46; P < 0.001), ADL score 41-60 (vs. ADL score 100; OR: 4.50; P = 0.012), and ADL score &#8804;40 (vs. ADL score 100; OR: 9.49; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with the risk of malnutrition in COVID-19 patients.

The simple operation of the Cosmic Ray Cube was crucial to finalise the measurements, as they were carried out during the COVID-19 lockdown and in a site devoid of scientific equipment. The muon flux measured at the Soratte hypogeum is above two orders of magnitude lower than the flux observed on the surface, suggesting the possible use of the Mt.

The challenges associated with imaging infected patients have resulted, to date, in a paucity of metabolic imaging studies of patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, it remains unclear if any abnormal metabolic events are taking place in patients who have recovered from COVID-19. PURPOSE: To use [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F] FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to measure metabolic activity in inflamed organs of patients convalescing post severe COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was performed in seven convalescing patients who were recovering from severe COVID-19 infection in February 2020. Prior to [18F] FDG PET/CT, all patients had received two consecutive negative results of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Clinical intake including symptoms, treatment, laboratory test results, and follow-up was performed. The PET/CT images of COVID-19 patients were compared to a control group of patients that were matched for age and sex. RESULTS: Residual pulmonary lesions were present in all patients and maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), average standard uptake value (SUVavg), maximum CT intensity (CTmax), and average CT intensity (CTavg) were all significantly greater than in the control group (p < 0.01 for all). In addition, SUVmax and SUVavg were significantly greater in the mediastinal lymph node and liver, and SUVmax was significantly greater in the spleen, of COVID-19 patients compared with controls (p < 0.05 for all). For the spleen, SUVmax (r2 = 0.863, p = 0.003) and SUVavg (r2 = 0.797, p = 0.007) were significantly correlated with blood lymphocyte count, and which was below the normal range in five of the seven (71.4%) patients convalescing post severe COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: [18F] FDG PET/CT quantitative analysis has shown that significant inflammation remained in lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes, spleen, and liver after two consecutive negative RT-PCR tests in patients convalescing post severe COVID-19 infection.","Bai, Yan; Xu, Junling; Chen, Lijuan; Fu, Chang; Kang, Yi; Zhang, Weifeng; Fakhri, Georges Ei; Gu, Jianqin; Shao, Fengmin; Wang, Meiyun",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,24,23

We evaluated the risk of COVID-19 among migrants from different areas of the world within the context of universal free access to medical care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort analysis of the cumulative incidence of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 among adult residents of Alcorcon (Spain) in the first wave of the disease up to April 25, 2020. RESULTS: The crude cumulative incidence among migrants (n=20419) was higher than among Spaniards (n=131599): 8.81 and 6.51 and per 1000 inhabitants, respectively (p < .001), but differed by region of origin. As per a negative binomial regression adjusted for age and sex, relative risk (RR) for COVID-19 for individuals from Europe, Asia, or North Africa was not significantly different from Spaniards. In contrast, a markedly increased risk was found in people from Sub-Saharan Africa (RR 3.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-9.41, p = .007), the Caribbean (RR 6.35, 95% CI 3.83-10.55, p < .001), and Latin America (RR 6.92, 95% CI 4.49-10.67, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America exhibited increased risk for COVID-19 as compared to Spaniards or migrants from Europe, North Africa, or Asia. Our data suggest ethnic background may play a role in risk for COVID-19. Migrants from some areas of the world may merit closer attention for both clinical and epidemiological reasons.","Guijarro, C; Pérez-Fernández, E; González-Piñeiro, B; Meléndez, V; Goyanes, M J; Renilla, Mª E; Casas, M L; Sastre, I; Velasco, M",Rev. clin. esp.

Vit D is a secosteroid hormone, which plays an important role in calcium and phosphorous homeostasis, and hence bone strength and also has a significant role in the immune health of an individual. It induces the expression of antimicrobial peptides that can decrease viral replication and also reduces the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines while enhancing the level of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Vit D supplementation in daily single doses (300–2000 IU/day) for 8–12 weeks had more protective effect for viral infections than large doses given at fixed intervals (100,000 or 200,000 IU per month or every 3 months). This evidence based review emphasizes the role of Vit D in the immune response to viral infections and proposes the immense value of Vit D supplementation, for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Sharma, Suresh K.; Mudgal, Shiv Kumar; Pai, Venkatesh S.; Chaturvedi, Jitender; Gaur, Rakhi",Natl.

We examined the relationship between Italian news media coverage of COVID-19 and compliance with stay-at-home orders, which could impact the spread of epidemics. We used a computational method for framing analysis (ANTMN) and combined it with Google's Community Mobility data. A time-series analysis using vector autoregressive models showed that the Italian media used media frames that were largely congruent with ones used by journalists in other countries: A scientific frame focusing on symptoms and health effects, a containment frame focusing on attempts to ameliorate risks, and a social frame, focusing on political and social impact. The prominence of different media frames over time was associated with changes in Italians' mobility patterns. Specifically, we found that the social frame was associated with increased mobility, whereas the containment frame was associated with decreased mobility. The results demonstrate that the ways the news media discuss epidemics can influence changes in community mobility, above and beyond the effect of the number of deaths per day.","Ophir, Yotam; Walter, Dror; Arnon, Daniel; Lokmanoglu, Ayse; Tizzoni, Michele; Carota, Joëlle; D039,; Antiga, Lorenzo; Nicastro, Emanuele",J Health Commun,24,32

HCQ has been used as an off-label drug and deemed safe and effective for the treatment of oral lesions, such as Sjogren syndrome (SS), chronic ulcerative stomatitis (CUS), and oral lichen planus (OLP). Because HCQ may be appropriately used for the off-label treatment of SS, CUS, and OLP, relevant safety concerns regarding HCQ therapy with regard to dosage, drug-to-drug interactions, and QT prolongation and secondary arrhythmia are discussed here.

Standard COVID-19 testing is insufficient to protect HCWs from these risks and prevent the spread of disease. Continuous monitoring of physiological data with wearable sensors, self-monitoring of symptoms, and asymptomatic COVID-19 testing may aid in the early detection of COVID-19 in HCWs and may help reduce further transmission among HCWs, patients, and families. OBJECTIVE: By using wearable sensors, smartphone-based symptom logging, and biospecimens, this project aims to assist HCWs in self-monitoring COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, longitudinal study of HCWs at a single institution. The study duration was 1 year, wherein participants were instructed on the continuous use of two wearable sensors (Fitbit Charge 3 smartwatch and TempTraq temperature patches) for up to 30 days. Participants consented to provide biospecimens (ie, nasal swabs, saliva swabs, and blood) for up to 1 year from study entry. Using a smartphone app called Roadmap 2.0, participants entered a daily mood score, submitted daily COVID-19 symptoms, and completed demographic and health-related quality of life surveys at study entry and 30 days later. Semistructured qualitative interviews were also conducted at the end of the 30-day period, following completion of daily mood and symptoms reporting as well as continuous wearable sensor use. RESULTS: A total of 226 HCWs were enrolled between April 28 and December 7, 2020. The last participant completed the 30-day study procedures on January 16, 2021. Data collection will continue through January 2023, and data analyses are ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: Using wearable sensors, smartphone-based symptom logging and survey completion, and biospecimen collections, this study will potentially provide data on the prevalence of COVID-19 infection among HCWs at a single institution. The study will also assess the feasibility of leveraging wearable sensors and self-monitoring of symptoms in an HCW population.

Some countries are seeing a tailing down of cases, while others are still having persistent and sustained community spread. These evolving disease patterns call for a customized and dynamic approach to the selection, screening, planning, and for the conduct of surgery for these patients. METHODS: The current literature and various international society guidelines were reviewed and a set of recommendations were drafted. These were circulated to the Governors of the Endoscopic and Laparoscopic Surgeons of Asia (ELSA) for expert comments and discussion. The results of these were compiled and are presented in this paper. RESULTS: The recommendations include guidance for selection and screening of patients in times of active community spread, limited community spread, during times of sporadic cases or recovery and the transition between phases. Personal protective equipment requirements are also reviewed for each phase as minimum requirements. Capability management for the re-opening of services is also discussed. The choice between open and laparoscopic surgery is patient based, and the relative advantages of laparoscopic surgery with regard to complications, and respiratory recovery after major surgery has to be weighed against the lack of safety data for laparoscopic surgery in COVID-19 positive patients. We provide recommendations on the operating room set up and conduct of general surgery. If laparoscopic surgery is to be performed, we describe circuit modifications to assist in reducing plume generation and aerosolization. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic requires every surgical unit to have clear guidelines to ensure both patient and staff safety. These guidelines may assist in providing guidance to units developing their own protocols. A judicious approach must be adopted as surgical units look to re-open services as the pandemic evolves.","Shabbir, Asim; Menon, Raj K; Somani, Jyoti; So, Jimmy B Y; Ozman, Mahir; Chiu, Philip W Y; Lomanto, Davide",Surg Endosc,24,23

However, how to more accurately and efficiently detect COVID-19 infected pneumonia and distinguish it from other community-acquired pneumonia remains a challenge. In order to address this challenge, we in this study develop and test a new computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme. It includes several image pre-processing algorithms to remove diaphragms, normalize image contrast-to-noise ratio, and generate three input images, then links to a transfer learning based convolutional neural network (a VGG16 based CNN model) to classify chest X-ray images into three classes of COVID-19 infected pneumonia, other community-acquired pneumonia and normal (non-pneumonia) cases. To this purpose, a publicly available dataset of 8,474 chest X-ray images is used, which includes 415 confirmed COVID-19 infected pneumonia, 5,179 community-acquired pneumonia, and 2,880 non-pneumonia cases. The dataset is divided into two subsets with 90% and 10% of images in each subset to train and test the CNN-based CAD scheme. The testing results achieve 94.0% of overall accuracy in classifying three classes and 98.6% accuracy in detecting Covid-19 infected cases. Thus, the study demonstrates the feasibility of developing a CAD scheme of chest X-ray images and providing radiologists useful decision-making supporting tools in detecting and diagnosis of COVID-19 infected pneumonia.","Heidari, Morteza; Mirniaharikandehei, Seyedehnafiseh; Khuzani, Abolfazl Zargari; Danala, Gopichandh; Qiu, Yuchen; Electrical, Bin Zheng School of; Engineering, Computer; Oklahoma, University of; USA, Norman; Electrical, Department of; Cruz, University of California Santa; Cruz, Santa; USA,",,24,16

In severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic 60% of patients had hepatic injury, due to phylogenetic similarities of the viruses it is assumed that COVID-19 is associated with acute liver injury. In this meta-analysis, we aim to study the occurrence and association of liver injury, comorbid liver disease and elevated liver enzymes in COVID-19 confirmed hospitalizations with outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from observational studies describing comorbid chronic liver disease, acute liver injury, elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalized patients from December 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020 was extracted following PRISMA guidelines. Adverse outcomes were defined as admission to intensive care unit (ICU), oxygen saturation <90%, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), severe disease and in-hospital mortality. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were obtained. RESULTS: 24 studies with 12,882 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. Overall prevalence of CM-CLD was 2.6%, COVID-19-ALI was 26.5%, elevated AST was 41.1% and elevated ALT was 29.1%. CM-CLD had no significant association with poor outcomes (pooled OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.71-1.29; p=0.78). COVID-19-ALI (1.68;1.04-2.70; p=0.03), elevated AST (2.98; 2.35-3.77; p<0.00001) and elevated ALT (1.85;1.49-2.29; p<0.00001) were significantly associated with higher odds of poor outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests that acute liver injury and elevated liver enzymes were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity. Future studies should evaluate changing levels of biomarkers amongst liver disease patients to predict poor outcomes of COVID-19 and causes of liver injury during COVID-19 infection.","Sharma, Ashish; Jaiswal, Pragya; Kerakhan, Yasameen; Saravanan, Lakshmi; Murtaza, Zeba; Zergham, Azka; Honganur, Nagaraj-Sanchitha; Akbar, Aelia; Deol, Aran; Francis, Benedict; Patel, Shakumar; Mehta, Deep; Jaiswal, Richa; Singh, Jagmeet; Patel, Urvish; Malik, Preeti",Ann Hepatol,24,26

However, although these applications can have actionable effects on public health efforts to control pandemics, the participatory or voluntary nature of these measures is obscuring the relationship between health information and traditional government surveillance techniques, potentially preventing effective oversight. Public health measures have traditionally been resistant to the integration of government-led intelligence techniques, such as signals intelligence (SIGINT), because of ethical and legal issues arising from the nature of surveillance techniques.We explore this rise of participatory SIGINT and its nature as an extension of biosurveillance through 3 drivers: the rise of surveillance capitalism, the exploitation of a public health crisis to obscure state of exception politics with a moral imperative, and the historically enduring nature of emergency-implemented surveillance measures.We conclude that although mobile applications may indeed be useful in containing pandemics, they should be subject to similar oversight and regulation as other government intelligence collection techniques.","Bernard, Rose; Bowsher, Gemma; Sullivan, Richard",Am J Public Health,24,16

Pneumococcal vaccination was discussed with the patients during clinical visits and highlighted in the after-visit summary addressed to the general practitioner before ocrelizumab initiation as part of our clinical standard of care. RESULTS: Pneumococcal vaccination was performed in 71/121 (58.7%) of patients, and 50/121 (41.3%) patients were not vaccinated. Patients who did not get a pneumococcal vaccination were younger (no vaccination vs vaccination; mean [95% CI] 40.1 [36.1-44.1] vs 45.4 [41.9-48.8], p = 0.028) and had more frequently a relapsing remitting disease course (no vaccination vs vaccination, n [%]; 43/50 [86.0%] vs 49/71 [69.0%], p = 0.031). Furthermore, patients who did not get vaccination had more frequently a history of comorbid psychiatric disorder (no vaccination vs vaccination, n (%); 12/50 [24.0] vs 7/71 [9.8], p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that in our single-center cohort, 41.3% of patients with MS do not get the recommended pneumococcal vaccination. Future research should focus on vaccine hesitancy in the vulnerable cohort of patients with MS to improve the safety of MS immunotherapies.","Diem, Lara; Friedli, Christoph; Chan, Andrew; Salmen, Anke; Hoepner, Robert",,24,16
218806,218806,218806,COVID-19 associate neurological complications,16.936123,7.639734,2020,"BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant recipients (KTR) are considered high-risk for morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, some studies did not show worse outcomes compared to non-transplant patients and there is little data about immunosuppressant drug levels and secondary infections in KTR with COVID-19. Herein, we describe our single-center experience with COVID-19 in KTR. METHODS: We captured KTR diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and May 18, 2020. After exclusion of KTR on hemodialysis and off immunosuppression, we compared the clinical course of COVID-19 between hospitalized KTR and non-transplant patients, matched by age and sex (controls). RESULTS: Eleven KTR were hospitalized and matched with 44 controls. One KTR and 4 controls died (case fatality rate: 9.1%). There were no significant differences in length of stay or clinical outcomes between KTR and controls. Tacrolimus or sirolimus levels were >10 ng/mL in 6 out of 9 KTR (67%). Bacterial infections were more frequent in KTR (36.3%), compared with controls (6.8%, P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: In our small case series, unlike earlier reports from the pandemic epicenters, the clinical outcomes of KTR with COVID-19 were comparable to those of non-transplant patients. Calcineurin or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTOR) levels were high. Bacterial infections were more common in KTR, compared with controls.","Hardesty, Anna; Pandita, Aakriti; Vieira, Kendra; Rogers, Ralph; Merhi, Basma; Osband, Adena J; Aridi, Jad; Shi, Yiyun; Bayliss, George; Cosgrove, Christopher; Gohh, Reginald; Morrissey, Paul; Beckwith, Curt G; Farmakiotis, Dimitrios",Transplant. proc,24,16

However, SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs is not known in Zambia. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 prevalence survey among Zambian HCWs in twenty health facilities in six districts in July 2020. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for health facility clustering, were calculated for each test separately and a combined measure for those who had PCR and ELISA performed. RESULTS: In total, 660 HCWs participated in the study, with 450 (68.2%) providing nasopharyngeal swab for PCR and 575 (87.1%) providing a blood specimen for ELISA. Sixty-six percent of participants were females and the median age was 31.5 years (interquartile range 26.2-39.8 years). The overall prevalence of the combined measure was 9.3% (95% CI 3.8%-14.7%). PCR-positive prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.6% (95% CI 2.0%-11.1%) and ELISA-positive prevalence was 2.2% (95% CI 0.5%-3.9%). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs was similar to a population-based estimate (10.6%) during a period of community transmission in Zambia. Public health measures such as establishing COVID-19 treatment centers before the first cases, screening for COVID-19 symptoms among patients accessing health facilities, infection prevention and control trainings, and targeted distribution of personal protective equipment based on exposure risk might have prevented increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission among Zambian HCWs.","Fwoloshi, Sombo; Hines, Jonas Z; Barradas, Danielle T; Yingst, Samuel; Siwingwa, Mpanji; Chirwa, Lameck; Zulu, James E; Banda, Dabwitso; Wolkon, Adam; Nikoi, Kotey I; Chirwa, Bob; Kampamba, Davies; Shibemba, Aaron; Sivile, Suilanji; Zyambo, Khozya D; Chanda, Duncan; Mupeta, Francis; Kapina, Muzala; Sinyange, Nyambe; Kapata, Nathan; Zulu, Paul M; Makupe, Alex; Mweemba, Aggrey; Mbewe, Nyuma; Ziko, Luunga; Mukonka, Victor; Mulenga, Lloyd B; Malama, Kennedy; Agolory, Simon",Clin. infect. dis,24,20

The aim of this essay is twofold: to situate American Pastoral more firmly within the revolutionary context of the 1960s and at the same time, through Woolf, to consider its historicism as it extends beyond the story of the Levovs and America to a disorder latent in things and capable of erupting at any time.","Milder, Robert",Studies in the Novel,24,1

No reteste, todas as amostras foram positivas na IFD e 19 resultaram negativas à ICC. O comportamento biológico dos isolados foi estudado em camundongos, revelando um período de incubação entre 7 e 17 dias, com sinais clínicos variados e duração média de 4 dias. Para a avaliação da patogenicidade, foram selecionadas cinco amostras do estudo, oriundas de diferentes espécies, como vírus de desafio nos camundongos imunizados com uma vacina comercial de vírus inativado. Os resultados do desafio indicaram que a proteção conferida pela vacina foi baixa para todas as amostras. A presença de anticorpos no soro dos camundongos vacinados foi demonstrada em diferentes períodos de vacinação. A tipificação antigênica de quatro amostras de vírus foi realizada pela imunofluorescência indireta (IFI) utilizando um painel de anticorpos monoclonais (MAbs) procedentes do Canadian Food and Inspection Agency, Ottawa, Canadá, identificando o perfil correspondente à variante de morcego hematófago Desmodus rotundus. Na caracterização genética com base nos genes que codificam a glicoproteína G e nucleoproteína N, observou-se que os isolados foram divididos em dois grupos genéticos independentes associados a ciclos endêmicos distintos.

There remain concerns regarding insufficient global supply and imperfect protection offered by currently available PPE strategies. A range of full-face snorkel masks were adapted to accept high grade medical respiratory filters using bespoke-designed 3D-printed connectors. We compared the protection offered by the snorkel to that of standard PPE using a placebo-controlled respirator filtering test as well as a fluorescent droplet deposition experiment. Out of the 56 subjects tested, 42 (75%) passed filtering testing with the snorkel mask compared to 31 (55%) with a FFP3 respirator mask (p = 0.003). Amongst the 43 subjects who were not excluded following a placebo control, 85% passed filtering testing with the snorkel versus to 68% with a FFP3 mask (p = 0.008). Following front and lateral spray of fluorescence liquid particles, the snorkel mask also provided superior protection against droplet deposition within the subject's face, when compared to a standard PPE combination of FFP3 masks and eye protection (3.19x108 versus 6.81x108 fluorescence units, p<0.001). The 3D printable adaptors are available for free download online at https://www.ImperialHackspace.com/COVID-19-Snorkel-Respirator-Project/. CONCLUSION: Full-face snorkel masks adapted as particulate respirators performed better than a standard PPE combination of FFP3 mask and eye protection against aerosol inhalation and droplet deposition. This adaptation is therefore a promising PPE solution for healthcare workers during highly contagious viral outbreaks.","Seligman, Henry; Zaman, Sameer; Pitcher, David S; Shun-Shin, Matthew J; Hepworth Lloyd, Freya; Androschuk, Vitaliy; Sen, Sayan; Al-Lamee, Rasha; Miller, David M; Barnett, Harry W; Haji, Gulam S; Howard, Luke S; Nijjer, Sukhjinder; Mayet, Jamil; Francis, Darrel P; Ces, Oscar; Linton, Nicholas W F; Peters, Nicholas S; Petraco, Ricardo",PLoS One,24,1

We aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emotional and cognitive responses and behavioral coping among Chinese residents. METHODS: An online investigation was run from 5 February to 25 February 2020, which recruited a total of 616 Chinese residents. Self-designed questionnaires were used to collect demographic information, epidemic knowledge and prevention of COVID-19 and characteristics of medical workers. The emotional and cognitive responses were assessed via the Symptom Check List-30 (SCL-30) and Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Behavioral coping was assessed via Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). RESULTS: In total, 131 (21.3%) medical workers and 485 (78.7%) members of the general public completed the structured online survey. The structural equation models showed that emotional response interacted with cognitive response, and both emotional response and cognitive response affected the behavioral coping. Multivariate regression showed that positive coping enhanced emotional and cognitive responses, while negative coping reduced emotional and cognitive responses. The emotional response (depression, anxiety and photic anxiety) scores of the participants were higher than the norm (all p < 0.001); in particular, the panic scores of members of the general public were higher than those of medical workers (p < 0.05), as well as the cognitive response (paranoia and compulsion). Both positive and negative coping scores of the participants were lower than the norm (p < 0.001), and the general public had higher negative coping than medical workers (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: During the preliminary stage of COVID-19, our study confirmed the significance of emotional and cognitive responses, which were associated with behavioral coping and significantly influenced the medical workers and the general public's cognition and level of public health emergency preparedness. These results emphasize the importance of psychological health at times of widespread crisis.","Cai, Zemin; Zheng, Shukai; Huang, Yanhong; Zhang, Xuanzhi; Qiu, Zhaolong; Huang, Anyan; Wu, Kusheng",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),24,6

In Study 1, a community sample of 292 participants completed the newly developed COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome Scale (C-19ASS) and results were subjected to a Principal Components Analysis. An 11-item two-factor structure was identified. In Study 2, a community sample of 426 participants completed a battery of questionnaires including the C-19ASS. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis was performed on the C-19ASS. A 9-item two-factor structure was confirmed. Results also indicated that the C-19ASS has acceptable levels of reliability and concurrent validity. The C-19ASS perseveration factor was found to explain an additional 9.3% variance in COVID-19 anxiety, and additional 2.2% variance in work and social adjustment (functional impairment), over and above all other variables. The C-19ASS appears to be a reliable and valid measure of the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome.

The October 21, 2020 the UN Secretary-General report on progress towards implementation of the UNHLM political declaration on TB stresses that although high-level commitments and targets had galvanized global and national progress towards ending TB, urgent and more ambitious investments and actions were required, especially in lieu of the COVID-19 pandemic where associated public health measures and travel restrictions, have disrupted health services universally. The report sets out 10 priority recommendations to get the world on track to reach agreed targets by 2022. Political commitment is more critical than ever. COVID-19 diagnostic and vaccination health services need to be aligned to TB services with active early case finding in communities, engaging the private sector care providers and mitigation of fear and stigma. Healthcare staff and community workers and leaders need to be provided with COVID-19 vaccination and personal protective equipment. The UNHLM declaration committed to mobilize 15 billion USD per annum for TB, of which 13 billion USD is for TB care and 2 billion USD per annum for TB R&D. The Global Fund needs to increase funding for TB. Learning from the unprecedented speed of COVID-19 vaccine development, fastracking development and evaluation of TB vaccines is essential. World leaders need to urgently address and reverse the socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and these will determine to what extent they will impact on achieving TB targets.","Sahu, Suvanand; Ditiu, Lucica; Sachdeva, Kuldeep Singh; Zumla, Alimuddin",Int. j. infect. dis,24,11

Methods: Staff of the health ministry and United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief designed an intervention targeting the estimated 30 400 people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy across South Sudan. The intervention comprised: (i) developing sensitization and operational guidance for clinicians to put tuberculosis preventive treatment delivery into clinical practice; (ii) disseminating monitoring and evaluation tools to document scale-up; (iii) implementing a programmatic pilot of tuberculosis preventive treatment; and (iv) identifying a mechanism for procurement and delivery of isoniazid to facilities dispensing tuberculosis preventive treatment. Staff aggregated routine programme data from facility registers on the numbers of people living with HIV who started on tuberculosis preventive treatment across all clinical sites providing this treatment during July 2019-March 2020. Findings: Tuberculosis preventive treatment was implemented in 13 HIV treatment sites during July-October 2019, then in 26 sites during November 2019-March 2020. During July 2019-March 2020, 6503 people living with HIV started tuberculosis preventive treatment. Conclusion: Lessons for other low-resource settings may include supplementing national guidelines with health ministry directives, clinician guidance and training, and an implementation pilot. A cadre of field supervisors can rapidly disseminate a standardized approach to implementation and monitoring of tuberculosis preventive treatment, and this approach can be used to strengthen other tuberculosis-HIV services. Procuring a reliable and steady supply of tuberculosis preventive treatment medication is crucial.","Boyd, Andrew T; Lodiongo, Dennis Kenyi; Benson, John Mondi; Aragaw, Shambel; Pasquale, Margaret Semira; Ayalneh, Habtamu; Olemukan, Robert; Avaku, Isaac; Baabe, Nicholas; Achut, Victoria; Chun, Helen; Bunga, Sudhir",Bull World Health Organ,24,16

However, little is known about the correlation between the pretreatment NLR and the prognosis of patients with brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-harboring mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. We sought to evaluate the predictive values in brain metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations. Methods: We retrospectively examined 133 patients with brain metastases (BMs) from lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations. NLR was calculated using N/L, where N and L, respectively, refer to peripheral blood neutrophil (N) and lymphocyte (L) counts. The cut-off value of NLR was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC). The Log rank test and Cox proportional hazard model were used to confirm the impact of NLR and other variables on survival. Results: An NLR value equal to or less than 2.99 was associated with prolonged survival in this cohort of patients in both variable and multivariable analysis. Conclusion: We concluded that NLR is an independent prognostic factor in BMs from lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations. This could serve as a useful prognostic biomarker and could be incorporated in the clinical prognostic index specific to patients with BMs.","Li, Hongwei; Wang, Weili; Yang, Xiaotang; Lian, Jianhong; Zhang, Shuangping; Cao, Jianzhong; Zhang, Xiaqin; Song, Xin; Jia, Sufang; Xue, Ruiqi",Cancer Manag Res,24,16

A large number of people have been infected and killed globally, including hill tribe people living in remote and border areas between Thailand and Myanmar. Different expectations of and experiences with the implemented disease prevention and control measures by local, national and international organizations have been widely reported. This study aimed to understand the experiences and expectations regarding the disease prevention and control measures that were implemented among hill tribe people in Thailand. METHODS: Qualitative data were collected from participants aged 20 and older who belonged to the hill tribes living on the border of northern Thailand and Myanmar. A semistructured questionnaire was used to guide interviews. Information was extracted for thematic analysis by the NVivo program. RESULTS: Fifty-seven participants (36 female, 21 male) were interviewed; 27 participants were Thai Yai, 14 participants were Yunnan Chinese, 8 participants were Akha, and 8 participants were from other tribes. The average age was 45.8 years (min = 20 years, max = 90 years). Thirty participants had never attended school, and the other 27 participants had received education at different levels, from primary school to higher education. Forty participants were unemployed, 13 worked as agriculturists, and the other 4 were attending school. Both positive experiences, such as improving personal hygiene practices, maintaining close contact and increasing relationships among family members and demonstrating the leadership of the villager leaders, and negative experiences, including interruption of social interactions, family financial problems, poor access to medical care services, and invisible people to the government, were found. Different expectations were observed regarding organizations at the local, national, and international levels. Expectations at the local level included villagers and community leaders taking action to strongly contribute to prevention and control measures and to prevent unscreened people from entering the village. Obtaining accurate information about the disease and being financially supported were expectations at the national level, while closing borders to protect cases from overflowing into their villages was an international-level expectation. CONCLUSION: Although hill tribes reside in very remote rural areas, they experience both positive and negative effects of the disease prevention and control measures implemented by organizations. Their expectations are formally and informally voiced to policy makers at the local, national and international levels.","Kitchanapaibul, Siwarak; Udplong, Anusorn; Apidechkul, Tawatchai; Tamornpark, Ratipark; Mulikaburt, Thanatchaporn; Srichan, Peeradone; Suratana, Soontaree; Yeemard, Fatima; Wongnuch, Pilasinee",BMC Public Health,24,6

We aimed to assess the risk of COVID-19 infection, COVID-19-associated hospitalization, and mortality among Israeli patients with psoriasis treated by TNFi relative to other systemic agents. A population-based cohort study was conducted to compare psoriasis patients treated by TNFi (n = 1943), with those treated by methotrexate (n = 1929), ustekinumab (n = 348), and acitretin (n = 1892) regarding COVID-19 outcomes. Risk of investigated outcomes was assessed using uni- and multi-variate Cox regression analyses. The incidence rate of COVID-19, COVID-19-associated hospitalization, and mortality in the TNFi group was 35.8 (95% CI, 26.1-47.9), 0.8 (95% CI, 0.0-4.2), and 0.0 per 1000 person-years, respectively. Exposure to TNFi was associated with a comparable risk of COVID-19 infection [adjusted hazard ration (HR) for TNFi vs methotrexate: 1.07 (95% CI, 0.67-1.71); TNFi vs ustekinumab: 1.07 (95% CI, 0.48-2.40); TNFi vs acitretin: 0.98 (95% CI, 0.61-1.57)]. TNFi was associated with a decreased risk of COVID-19-associated hospitalization relative to methotrexate (adjusted HR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01-0.82) and ustekinumab (adjusted HR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.00-0.64), but not to acitretin (adjusted HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.16-6.16). No significant difference in COVID-19-associated mortality was found between the four different groups. TNFi was associated with a decreased risk of admissions due to COVID-19. Our findings substantiate the continuation of TNFi treatment during the pandemic. TNFi may be positively considered in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis warranting systemic treatment during the pandemic.","Kridin, Khalaf; Schonmann, Yochai; Damiani, Giovanni; Peretz, Avi; Onn, Erez; Bitan, Dana Tzur; Cohen, Arnon D",Dermatol Ther,24,16

This viral coagulopathy may occur despite thromboprophylaxis and raises mortality; the risk appears highest among critically ill inpatients monitored in the intensive care unit. The prevalence of venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients has been reported to reach â¼10-35%, while autopsies raise it to nearly 60%. The most common thrombotic complication is pulmonary embolism, which though may occur in the absence of a recognizable deep venous thrombosis and may be due to pulmonary arterial thrombosis rather than embolism, resulting in thrombotic occlusion of small- to mid-sized pulmonary arteries and subsequent infarction of lung parenchyma. This micro-thrombotic pattern seems more specific for COVID-19 and is associated with an intense immuno-inflammatory reaction that results in diffuse occlusive thrombotic micro-angiopathy with alveolar damage and vascular angiogenesis. Furthermore, thrombosis has also been observed in various arterial sites, including coronary, cerebral and peripheral arteries. Biomarkers related to coagulation, platelet activation and inflammation have been suggested as useful diagnostic and prognostic tools for COVID-19-associated coagulopathy; among them, D-dimer remains a key biomarker employed in clinical practice. Various medical societies have issued guidelines or consensus statements regarding thromboprophylaxis and treatment of these thrombotic complications specifically adapted to COVID-19 patients. All these issues are detailed in this review, data from meta-analyses and current guidelines are tabulated, while the relevant mechanisms of this virus-associated coagulopathy are pictorially illustrated.","Manolis, Antonis S; Manolis, Theodora A; Manolis, Antonis A; Papatheou, Despoina; Melita, Helen",J Cardiovasc Pharmacol Ther,24,6

METHODS: Data of 43,995 Brazilian adults from a cross-sectional, nationwide behavior research were used. Participants reported the frequency on loneliness, sadness (feel sad, crestfallen or depressed) and anxiety (feel worried, anxious or nervous) feelings during the pandemic period. Frequency and duration of physical activity as well as duration of TV-viewing before and during the pandemic period were also reported. We created four categories of reported changes in physical activity (1-consistently active, 2-become active, 3-become inactive or 4-consistently inactive) and TV-viewing (1-consistently high, 2-become low, 3-become high or 4-consistently high). Participants also reported previous diagnoses of depression [yes (PD) or no (nPD). Logistic regression models separating people with and without depression were created. RESULTS: Compared to consistently active participants, to become inactive during the pandemic was associated with a higher odds for loneliness [nPD:OR:1.32 (95%CI,1.02-1.70); PD:2.22 (1.21-4.06)], sadness [nPD:1.34 (1.01-1.77); PD:2.88 (1.54-5.36)], and anxiety [nPD:1.71 (1.30-2.25); PD:2.55 (1.20-5.42)]. Also, people with depression and consistently physically inactive presented higher odds for loneliness and sadness. Compared to consistently low TV-viewing, participants that become with high TV-viewing showed higher odds for loneliness [nPD:1.59 (1.37-1.86)], sadness [nPD:1.68 (1.44-1.96); PD:1.61 (1.21 to 2.15)] and anxiety [nPD:1.73 (1.48-2.02); PD:1.58 (1.12-2.23)].

To that end, the overarching aims of this study were to understand students' attitude toward and knowledge of COVID-19 and examine the predictors of their attitude toward hand hygiene. DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional survey study, conducted in Saudi Arabia, enrolled interns from diverse healthcare-related fields. The questionnaire was divided into three sections: sociodemographic data, knowledge of COVID-19, and attitude toward hand hygiene. The data was expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR). RESULTS: In all, 371 responses were analyzed. The median knowledge score was 20, which was considered good. There were no statistically significant differences across age, hospital setting, or gender. Of the 254 respondents who had attended an educational session, 167 (65%) had a good knowledge score and 83 (33%) had a moderate score, compared with only four (2%) who had a poor score. The cumulative median score of the respondents' attitudes was 6 (IQR [2]), which reflects a suboptimal attitude-only 38 (22%) reported a good attitude. The predicted effect of knowledge on attitude (good/suboptimal) was statistically significant (p = 0.02) using univariate logistic regression.

Many factors influence willingness to take vaccines including safety, efficacy, and side effects. Given their proximity to research and education, university students and employees represent an interesting cohort in which to investigate vaccine hesitancy. The aim of this study was to assess the attitudes of Qatar University employees and students towards the COVID-19 vaccine. In total, 231 employees and 231 students participated in an online cross-sectional study in February 2021. Of the sample, 62.6% were willing to take a vaccine against COVID-19. Participants with or taking postgraduate degrees were more willing to take the vaccine compared to participants with or taking a diploma or bachelor’s degree (p &lt;0.001). Males had a higher rate of vaccine acceptance (p &lt;0.001). In the group that regarded flu vaccination as important, 13% were unwilling to take COVID-19 vaccine. There were no associations between willingness to vaccinate and vaccine/virus knowledge and social media use. Participants showed a high level of concern regarding vaccine side effects in themselves or their children. Two-thirds agreed or strongly agreed that they would take the vaccine if it was mandatory for international travel. Our participants were neutral to the origin of vaccine development. These findings, which represent data collected after the start of the national vaccination program, show that vaccine hesitancy persists in the Qatari population and that some groups, such as undergraduate students, could benefit from specific, targeted public health campaigns.","Al-Mulla, Reem Abu-Madi Marawan Talafha Qusai M.; Tayyem, Reema F.; Abdallah, Atiyeh M.",Vaccines,24,25

Online fever clinics were developed by hospitals, largely relieving the hospital's burden. Online fever clinics could help people stay out of crowded hospitals and prevent the risk of cross infections. The objective of our study was to describe the patient characteristics of an online fever clinic and explore the most important concerns and question of online patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study extracted data from fever clinic records in medical information systems from January 24 to February 18, 2020 in a tertiary hospital in Wuhan. We described the characteristics of patients in fever clinic, then we extracted and classified questions of patient consultations through the online fever clinic dataset. RESULTS: For the 64 487 patients who attended the online fever clinic, the average age was 30.4 years, and 37 665 (58.4%) were female patients. The current state of patients from online were home without isolation (52 360 [81.2%]), home isolated (11 152 [17.29%]), and outpatient observation (975 [1.51%]). From the 594 patient questions analyzed, confirming diagnosis and seeking medical treatment account for 60.61% and 38.05%, respectively, followed by treating (25.59%), preventing (4.38%), and relieving anxiety (1.68%). DISCUSSION: Online fever clinics can effectively relieve patients' mood of panic, and doctors can guide patients with suspected of COVID-19 to isolate and protect themselves through online fever clinic. Online fever clinics can also help to reduce the pressure of hospital fever clinics and prevent cross infection. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated the importance of online fever clinics during the COVID-19 outbreak for prevention and control.","Li, Gang; Fan, Guorui; Chen, Yanyan; Deng, Zhaohua",J Am Med Inform Assoc,24,24

To meet that need, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), the nation's largest hospital surveillance system, launched a module for collecting hospital coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) data. We present time-series estimates of the critical hospital capacity indicators from April 1 to July 14, 2020. DESIGN: From March 27 to July 14, 2020, the NHSN collected daily data on hospital bed occupancy, number of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and the availability and/or use of mechanical ventilators. Time series were constructed using multiple imputation and survey weighting to allow near-real-time daily national and state estimates to be computed. RESULTS: During the pandemic's April peak in the United States, among an estimated 431,000 total inpatients, 84,000 (19%) had COVID-19. Although the number of inpatients with COVID-19 decreased from April to July, the proportion of occupied inpatient beds increased steadily. COVID-19 hospitalizations increased from mid-June in the South and Southwest regions after stay-at-home restrictions were eased. The proportion of inpatients with COVID-19 on ventilators decreased from April to July. CONCLUSIONS: The NHSN hospital capacity estimates served as important, near-real-time indicators of the pandemic's magnitude, spread, and impact, providing quantitative guidance for the public health response. Use of the estimates detected the rise of hospitalizations in specific geographic regions in June after they declined from a peak in April. Patient outcomes appeared to improve from early April to mid-July.","Sapiano, Mathew R P; Dudeck, Margaret A; Soe, Minn; Edwards, Jonathan R; O039,; Leary, Erin N; Wu, Hsiu; Allen-Bridson, Katherine; Amor, Agasha; Arcement, Rashad; Chernetsky Tejedor, Sheri; Dantes, Ray; Gross, Cindy; Haass, Kathryn; Konnor, Rebecca; Kroop, Seth R; Leaptrot, Denise; Lemoine, Kent; Nkwata, Allan; Peterson, Kelly; Wattenmaker, Lauren; Weiner-Lastinger, Lindsey M; Pollock, Daniel; Benin, Andrea L",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,24,1

It answers this affirmatively by first proposing, in Part I, what love should mean in policy formulation. However, as rationality remains highly prized in policy formulation, it considers emotion as prejudicial to its cool and level-headed processes and assumes that human behaviour is exclusively negative. To overcome this drawback, love is proposed for inclusion in policy formulation on the rationale that it is a real and positive emotion. Part II takes an eclectic approach and provides six examples of love's relevance drawn from hate studies, medicine, business, psychology, religion, and women's preferences. Together, they constitute a significant pattern and demonstrate love's versatility, making it relevant for those who formulate policy. Suggestions for policy applications are also made. While acknowledging that including love in policy formulation is not a panacea, this positive, universal, and resilient emotion should be incorporated in policy formulation to increase its effectiveness and relevance given the exceptional negativity of our times following COVID-19.","Sur, Rahul",,24,24

Herein, an antifouling electrochemical biosensor was constructed based on electropolymerized polyaniline (PANI) nanowires and newly designed peptides for the detection of the COVID-19 N-gene. The inverted Y-shaped peptides were designed with excellent antifouling properties and two anchoring branches, and their antifouling performances against proteins and complex biological media were investigated using different approaches. Based on the biotin-streptavidin affinity system, biotin-labeled probes specific to the N-gene (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein) of COVID-19 were immobilized onto the peptide-coated PANI nanowires, forming a highly sensitive and antifouling electrochemical sensing interface for the detection of COVID-19 nucleic acid. The antifouling genosensor demonstrated a wide linear range (10-14 to 10-9 M) and an exceptional low detection limit (3.5 fM). The remarkable performance of the genosensor derives from the high peak current of PANI, which is chosen as the sensing signal, and the extraordinary antifouling properties of designed peptides, which guarantee accurate detection in complex systems.

Given the logistical challenges of psychophysical testing, understanding the longitudinal relationship between self-reported and quantitative measures can help accurately identify patients with persistent olfactory dysfunction. This study aimed to longitudinally correlate measured and subjective olfactory function in COVID-19 subjects. METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal study evaluating subjective and measured olfaction was conducted on ambulatory COVID-19 subjects. Olfaction scores were obtained using a visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 = anosmia, 10 = normosmia) and the validated 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT). Weekly testing was performed until recovery (BSIT &#8805; 9/12 and/or VAS = 10/10) or study completion. RESULTS: Eighty-six polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive COVID-19 subjects were recruited &#8804;3 days from diagnosis and 52 completed longitudinal testing. Among those with self-reported smell loss at recruitment, similar levels (75.8%) of objective (BSIT &#8805; 9/12) and subjective recovery were obtained using a VAS cutoff &#8805;8, yet only 30.3% reported complete subjective recovery (VAS = 10). Median times to objective and complete subjective olfactory recovery were 12 ± 2.3 and 24 ± 3.5 days, respectively. Although both measures showed chemosensory improvement, the distributions of objective and full subjective olfactory recovery differed significantly (log rank test &#967;2 = 6.46, degrees of freedom [df] = 1, p = 0.011). Overall correlation between BSIT and VAS scores was moderate to strong across longitudinal follow-up (rs = 0.41-0.65). CONCLUSION: Self-reported and psychophysically measured COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction improve at similar levels and are moderately correlated longitudinally, yet there is a significant delay in complete subjective recovery. Psychophysical testing in conjunction with qualitative assessments may be considered for counseling and follow-up of patients with COVID-19 smell loss.","Prajapati, Divya P; Shahrvini, Bita; Said, Mena; Srinivas, Shanmukha; DeConde, Adam S; Yan, Carol H",Int. forum allergy rhinol,24,16

However, vaccine supplies are limited, and there are concerns about side-effects, particularly with the ChAdOx1nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) vaccine. OBJECTIVES: To report our first experience of pwMS receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine. METHODS: Service evaluation. pwMS using the MS service at Barts Health NHS Trust were sent questionnaires to report symptoms following vaccination. RESULTS: Thirty-three responses were returned, 29/33 pwMS received a first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine, the remaining four received a first dose of BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine. All but two patients (94%) reported any symptoms including a sore arm (70%), flu-like symptoms (64%), fever (21%), fatigue (27%), and headache (21%). In more than 2/3 patients, symptoms lasted up to 48 hours, and with the exception of two pwMS reporting symptom duration of 10 and 12 days, respectively, symptoms in the remainder resolved within seven days. No severe adverse effects occurred. CONCLUSIONS: pwMS report transient symptoms following AstraZeneca vaccination, characteristics of which were similar to those reported in the non-MS population. Symptoms may be more pronounced in pwMS due to the temperature-dependent delay in impulse propagation (Uhthoff's phenomenon) due to demyelination.","Allen-Philbey, K; Stennett, A; Begum, T; Johnson, A C; Dobson, R; Giovannoni, G; Gnanapavan, S; Marta, M; Smets, I; Turner, B P; Baker, D; Mathews, J; Schmierer, K",Mult Scler Relat Disord,24,1

While the biochemical networks involved in energy transduction are well-characterized, the energetic costs and constraints for specific cellular processes remain largely unknown. In particular, what are the energy budgets of cells? What are the constraints and limits energy flows impose on cellular processes? Do cells operate near these limits, and if so how do energetic constraints impact cellular functions? Physics has provided many tools to study nonequilibrium systems and to define physical limits, but applying these tools to cell biology remains a challenge. Physical bioenergetics, which resides at the interface of nonequilibrium physics, energy metabolism, and cell biology, seeks to understand how much energy cells are using, how they partition this energy between different cellular processes, and the associated energetic constraints.

However, the construction of multi-modality images is not an easy task. The proposed approach, initially, decomposes the image into sub-bands using a non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) domain. Thereafter, an extreme version of the Inception (Xception) is used for feature extraction of the source images. The multi-objective differential evolution is used to select the optimal features. Thereafter, the coefficient of determination and the energy loss based fusion functions are used to obtain the fused coefficients. Finally, the fused image is computed by applying the inverse NSCT.

Older age, and underlying health conditions, are associated with higher risk of death from COVID-19. This study aimed to describe the population at risk of severe COVID-19 due to underlying health conditions across the United Kingdom. METHODS: We used anonymised electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD to estimate the point prevalence on 5 March 2019 of the at-risk population following national guidance. Prevalence for any risk condition and for each individual condition is given overall and stratified by age and region with binomial exact confidence intervals. We repeated the analysis on 5 March 2014 for full regional representation and to describe prevalence of underlying health conditions in pregnancy. We additionally described the population of cancer survivors, and assessed the value of linked secondary care records for ascertaining COVID-19 at-risk status. RESULTS: On 5 March 2019, 24.4% of the UK population were at risk due to a record of at least one underlying health condition, including 8.3% of school-aged children, 19.6% of working-aged adults, and 66.2% of individuals aged 70 years or more. 7.1% of the population had multimorbidity. The size of the at-risk population was stable over time comparing 2014 to 2019, despite increases in chronic liver disease and diabetes and decreases in chronic kidney disease and current asthma. Separately, 1.6% of the population had a new diagnosis of cancer in the past 5 y. CONCLUSIONS: The population at risk of severe COVID-19 (defined as either aged &#8805;70 years, or younger with an underlying health condition) comprises 18.5 million individuals in the UK, including a considerable proportion of school-aged and working-aged individuals. Our national estimates broadly support the use of Global Burden of Disease modelled estimates in other countries. We provide age- and region- stratified prevalence for each condition to support effective modelling of public health interventions and planning of vaccine resource allocation. The high prevalence of health conditions among older age groups suggests that age-targeted vaccination strategies may efficiently target individuals at higher risk of severe COVID-19.","Walker, Jemma L; Grint, Daniel J; Strongman, Helen; Eggo, Rosalind M; Peppa, Maria; Minassian, Caroline; Mansfield, Kathryn E; Rentsch, Christopher T; Douglas, Ian J; Mathur, Rohini; Wong, Angel Y S; Quint, Jennifer K; Andrews, Nick; Bernal, Jamie Lopez; Scott, J Anthony; Ramsay, Mary; Smeeth, Liam; McDonald, Helen I",BMC Public Health,24,10

We do not know whether the blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy of beta-blockers varies across the day. This review focuses on the subclass of beta-blockers with partial agonist activity (BBPAA). OBJECTIVES: To assess the degree of variation in hourly BP lowering efficacy of BBPAA over a 24-hour period in adults with essential hypertension. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for relevant studies up to June 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register; CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 5; MEDLINE Ovid; Embase Ovid; the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We sought to include all randomised and non-randomised trials that assessed the hourly effect of BBPAA by ambulatory monitoring, with a minimum follow-up of three weeks. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected the included trials and extracted the data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Outcomes included in the review were end-point hourly systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and heart rate (HR), measured using a 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) device. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen non-randomised baseline controlled trials of BBPAA met our inclusion criteria, but only seven studies, involving 121 participants, reported hourly ambulatory BP data that could be included in the meta-analysis. Beta-blockers studied included acebutalol, pindolol and bopindolol. We judged most studies at high or unclear risk of bias for selection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias. We judged the overall certainty of the evidence to be very low for all outcomes. We analysed and presented data by each hour post-dose. Very low-certainty evidence showed that hourly mean reduction in BP and HR visually showed an attenuation over time. Over the 24-hour period, the magnitude of SBP lowering at each hour ranged from -3.68 mmHg to -17.74 mmHg (7 studies, 121 participants), DBP lowering at each hour ranged from -2.27 mmHg to -9.34 mmHg (7 studies, 121 participants), and HR lowering at each hour ranged from -0.29 beats/min to -10.29 beats/min (4 studies, 71 participants). When comparing between three 8-hourly time intervals that correspond to day, evening, and night time hours, BBPAA was less effective at lowering BP and HR at night, than during the day and evening. However, because we judged that these outcomes were supported by very low-certainty evidence, further research is likely to have an important impact on the estimate of effect and may change the conclusion. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to draw general conclusions about the degree of variation in hourly BP-lowering efficacy of BBPAA over a 24-hour period, in adults with essential hypertension. Very low-certainty evidence showed that BBPAA acebutalol, pindolol, and bopindolol lowered BP more during the day and evening than at night. However, the number of studies and participants included in this review was very small, further limiting the certainty of the evidence. We need further and larger trials, with accurate recording of time of drug intake, and with reporting of standard deviation of BP and HR at each hour.","Zhang, Xiao-Yin; Soufi, Sam; Dormuth, Colin; Musini, Vijaya M",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,24,10

Associated causes have been due to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohystiocytosis (HLH) syndrome, medication-induced, or acute liver failure. Statins, omega-3 polyunsaturated acids, niacin, and fibrates are common oral lipid lowering therapy options in patients at risk for hypertriglyceridemia. The severity of hypertriglyceridemia in COVID-19 patients with triglyceride values reaching greater than 1,000 mg/dL put them at a heightened risk of pancreatitis and therefore an essential need to acutely lower their levels.

Since the field of professional soccer is no exception, such measures may have a negative impact on the player's well-being and their perceived training loads. Objective: To determine the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on the training load and the well-being of female professional soccer players in Chile. Materials and methods: Exploratory, cross-sectional, descriptive study conducted on 32 players of the Chile women's national soccer team. The perception of training load and the level of well-being were assessed by means of the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale and a questionnaire developed in 2010, respectively. Both the administration of the questionnaire and the permanent monitoring of the RPE records were carried out in two periods of 12 weeks: regular preparatory phase (12/12/2019-10/03/2020) and lockdown (16/03/2020-07/06/2020). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the Wilcoxon test was used to determine if there were significant differences between periods. Results: Significant differences (p&lt;0.05) and threshold effect sizes (ES)=1.2, 2.0 and 4.0 (large, very large, and extremely large, respectively) were found between both periods in all variables evaluated by the well-being questionnaire (except for sleep quality): muscle soreness and stress level (ES=1.9), perceived fatigue (ES=2.5), general well-being (ES=2.4), and mood (ES=4.2). No differences were found regarding the perception of the training load (ES=0.1) between both periods. Conclusions: The level of well-being among the participants was negatively affected by the compulsory lock-down. Therefore, coaching staffs should continue to monitor the level of the well-being of professional soccer players during the lockdown, both individually and collectively. Even though the perception of training load was not affected, it is not possible to state that a more extended period of confinement will not reduce it, resulting in a drop in performance.","Villaseca-Vicuña, Rodrigo; Pérez-Contreras, Jorge; Merino-Muñoz, Pablo; González-Jurado, José Antonio; Aedo-Muñoz, Esteban",Rev.

The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has increased the demand for low-cost diagnostic lab-on-chips manifold. Sample preparation (dilution or mixing of biochemical fluids) is an indispensable step of any biochemical experiment including sensitive detection and successful assay execution downstream. Although for valve-based microfluidic biochips various design automation tools are currently available, they are expensive, and prone to various manufacturing and operational defects. Additionally, many problems are left open in the domain of free-flowing biochips, where only a single layer of flow-channels is used for fluid-flow devoid of any kind of control layer/valves. In this work, we present a methodology for designing a free-flowing biochip that is capable of performing fluid dilution according to users requirement. The proposed algorithm for sample preparation utilizes the Farey-sequence arithmetic of fractions that are used to represent the concentration factor of the target fluid. We also present the detailed layout design of a free-flowing microfluidic architecture that emulates the dilution algorithm. The network is simulated using COMSOL multi-physics software accounting for relevant hydrodynamic parameters. Experiments on various test-cases support the efficacy of the proposed design in terms of accuracy, convergence time, reactant cost, and simplicity of the fluidic network compared to prior art.","Banerjee, Tapalina; Poddar, Sudip; Ho, Tsung-Yi; Bhattacharya, Bhargab B.",,24,25

Two surveys and interviews were conducted with school teachers in Spain. The first survey was completed at the onset of the COVID‐19 lockdown, the second survey and interviews in the weeks leading up to the school year that followed. Survey questions were from SELFIE and the Work Tasks Motivation Scale for Teachers. Moreover we analysed the type of advice teachers sought on Twitter during the lockdown and post‐lockdown periods. Results indicate that teachers believe their proficiency in using digital technologies for teaching has improved. Teacher confidence in using technology for preparing lessons, class teaching, assessing and providing feedback, and for communicating with students and families has increased along with teacher motivation to improve their digital skills and use digital technologies for teaching. Teacher advice seeking on Twitter seemed to shift from serving immediate instructional needs to focussing on professional development and the creation of their own digital content.

What matters for people is the quality and length of lives and one should measure costs and benefits in terms of those things. That raises difficulties in measurement, particularly in valuing potential lives saved. We draw upon guidelines used in the UK for public health decisions, as well as other measures, which allow a comparison between health effects and other economic effects. We look at evidence on the effectiveness of past severe restrictions applied in European countries, focusing on the evidence from the UK. The paper considers policy options for the degree to which restrictions are eased. There is a need to normalise how we view COVID because its costs and risks are comparable to other health problems (such as cancer, heart problems, diabetes) where governments have made resource decisions for decades. The lockdown is a public health policy and we have valued its impact using the tools that guide health care decisions in the UK public health system. The evidence suggests that the costs of continuing severe restrictions in the UK are large relative to likely benefits so that a substantial easing in general restrictions in favour of more targeted measures is warranted.","Miles, David; Stedman, Mike; Heald, Adrian",Natl.

The number of cases infected with COVID-19 is increasing daily, and there is a limitation in the number of test kits needed in hospitals. Therefore, there is an imperative need to implement an efficient automatic diagnosis system to alleviate COVID-19 spreading among people. This article presents a discussion of the utilization of convolutional neural network (CNN) models with different learning strategies for automatic COVID-19 diagnosis. First, we consider the CNN-based transfer learning approach for automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 from X-ray images with different training and testing ratios. Different pre-trained deep learning models in addition to a transfer learning model are considered and compared for the task of COVID-19 detection from X-ray images. Confusion matrices of these studied models are presented and analyzed. Considering the performance results obtained, ResNet models (ResNet18, ResNet50, and ResNet101) provide the highest classification accuracy on the two considered datasets with different training and testing ratios, namely 80/20, 70/30, 60/40, and 50/50. The accuracies obtained using the first dataset with 70/30 training and testing ratio are 97.67%, 98.81%, and 100% for ResNet18, ResNet50, and ResNet101, respectively. For the second dataset, the reported accuracies are 99%, 99.12%, and 99.29% for ResNet18, ResNet50, and ResNet101, respectively. The second approach is the training of a proposed CNN model from scratch. The results confirm that training of the CNN from scratch can lead to the identification of the signs of COVID-19 disease.","Emara, Heba M; Shoaib, Mohamed R; Elwekeil, Mohamed; El-Shafai, Walid; Taha, Taha E; El-Fishawy, Adel S; El-Rabaie, El-Sayed M; Alshebeili, Saleh A; Dessouky, Moawad I; Abd El-Samie, Fathi E",Microsc. res. tech,24,3

However, there lacks empirical evidence on socioeconomic inequalities in child mental health and associated factors. METHODS: We conducted a population-based online survey in 21,526 children in China, when children were confined at home for nearly two months during the pandemic. We assessed child mental health problems with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Parental education level and provincial gross domestic product (GDP) per capita were treated as proxies for individual- and population-level socioeconomic status (SES), respectively. Lifestyle and family environment factors included sleep disturbances, physical activity, screen time, primary caregiver, parental mental health, and harsh parenting. RESULTS: Of the children, 32.31% demonstrated mental health problems. Parental education from the highest (undergraduate and above) to the lowest (middle school and below) increased the adjusted odds ratio(aOR) for child mental health problems by 42% (aOR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.29-1.57); provincial GDP per capita (RMB) from the highest (>¥100K) to the lowest (&#8804;¥70K) increased aOR by 41% (aOR, 1.41; 95% CI%, 1.28-1.55). Sleep disturbances, physical activity <1 h/day, media exposure &#8805;2 h/day, non-parental care, poor parental mental health, and harsh parenting were independently associated with increased child mental health problems, regardless of SES. LIMITATIONS: The potential sampling bias, subjective measures, and the cross-sectional design are the main limitations. CONCLUSION: The first evidence from China suggests socioeconomic inequality in child mental health during the pandemic. As unhealthy lifestyle and unfavorable family environment are contributory factors, prioritized interventions are needed to reduce socioeconomic inequality in child mental health problems.","Li, Wen; Wang, Zijing; Wang, Guanghai; Ip, Patrick; Sun, Xiaoning; Jiang, Yanrui; Jiang, Fan",J Affect Disord,24,21

Using theoretical calculations, we uncover that the subtle interplay of spin-orbit coupling, crystal symmetry, and orbital polarization is at the core of the observed strain dependence of spin-orbit torques. Our results open a path to integrating two energy efficient spin manipulation approaches, the electric-field-induced strain and the current-induced magnetization switching, thereby enabling novel device concepts.","Filianina, Mariia; Hanke, Jan-Philipp; Lee, Kyujoon; Han, Dong-Soo; Jaiswal, Samridh; Rajan, Adithya; Jakob, Gerhard; Mokrousov, Yuriy; Kläui, Mathias",Phys Rev Lett,24,16

An early-stage detection of COVID-19 is crucial for the containment of the pandemic it has caused. In this study, a transfer learning-based COVID-19 screening technique is proposed. The motivation of this study is to design an automated system that can assist medical staff especially in areas where trained staff are outnumbered. The study investigates the potential of transfer learning-based models for automatically diagnosing diseases like COVID-19 to assist the medical force, especially in times of an outbreak. In the proposed work, a deep learning model, i.e., truncated VGG16 (Visual Geometry Group from Oxford) is implemented to screen COVID-19 CT scans. The VGG16 architecture is fine-tuned and used to extract features from CT scan images. Further principal component analysis (PCA) is used for feature selection. For the final classification, four different classifiers, namely deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), online sequential ELM, and bagging ensemble with support vector machine (SVM) are compared. The best performing classifier bagging ensemble with SVM within 385 ms achieved an accuracy of 95.7%, the precision of 95.8%, area under curve (AUC) of 0.958, and an F1 score of 95.3% on 208 test images.

Large-scale campaigns for evidence dissemination and promotion through targeted interventions on social media may help overcome some of these barriers. To date, most breastfeeding research on social media only focuses on content analysis, and there remains limited knowledge about the social networks of online communities (who interacts with whom), influencers in the breastfeeding space and the diffusion of evidence-based knowledge. This study, grounded in social network theory, aims to better understand the breastfeeding communication landscape on Twitter including determining the presence of a breastfeeding network, communities and key influencers. Further, we characterize influencer interactions, roles and the content being shared. The study revealed an overall breastfeeding social network of 3,798 unique individuals (users) and 3,972 tweets with commonly used hashtags (e.g., #breastfeeding and #normalizebreastfeeding). Around one third of users (n = 1,324, 34%) exchanged pornographic content (PC) that sexualized breastfeeding. The non-PC network (n = 2,474 users) formed 144 unique communities, and content flowing within the network was disproportionately influenced by 59 key influencers. However, these influencers had mostly inward-oriented interaction (% composition, E-I index: 47% professionals, -0.18; 41% interested citizens, -0.67; 12% companies, -0.18), limiting opportunities for evidence-based dissemination to the lay public. Although more tweets about peer-reviewed research findings were sent compared with tweets about nonevidence-based lay recommendations, our findings suggest that it is the lay public who often communicated findings, which may be overcome through a targeted social network-based intervention.","Moukarzel, Sara; Rehm, Martin; Daly, Alan J",Matern Child Nutr,24,16

At that time, most patients with OUD were considered to have anti-social personality disorders and the regulations aimed to exert maximal control over medication access. Six- or seven-day clinic attendance is required for months, regardless of distance, or childcare and other social responsibilities. Take home medications are not allowed unless rigid and formulaic conditions are met. Although addiction medicine has rejected the ""criminal"" paradigm in favor of OUD as a treatable medical disorder, methadone regulations have not kept pace with the science.Pregnancy is characterized by an ultra-rapid metabolic state, but regulations prevent the use of daily divided doses of methadone to maintain stability. This results in repeated episodes of maternal/fetal opioid withdrawal, as well as other fetal physiologic abnormalities. Interference with dose regimen adjustments prevents optimal outcomes.Further, methadone clinics are mostly urban, leaving patients in rural areas without access. This led to excessive morbidity and mortality when the opioid crisis hit. The response of merely expanding capacity in overcrowded urban clinics created a contagion menace when Covid-19 arrived. Pregnant women (and parents with children) were forced to negotiate dosing in dangerous conditions.A revised methadone system must provide treatment that is local, flexible, and limited in size to manage viral contagion risks. This regulatory change can most easily be started by changing regulations that adversely affect pregnant women.","McCarthy, John J; Jones, Hendree E; Terplan, Mishka; Rudolf, Vania P; von Klimo, Melinda Campopiano",J Addict Med,24,4

Embedding ethics into these new technologies is critical and requires a co-design approach, with end users participating throughout. Developing humane AT begins with a participatory, user-centered design embedded in an iterative co-creation process, and guided by an ethos prioritizing beneficence, user autonomy and agency. To gain insight into plausible AT development pathways (""futures""), we use scenario planning as a tool to articulate themes in the research literature. Four plausible scenarios are developed and compared to identify one as a desired ""humane"" future for AT development.

Over a grazing period of 49 d, 48 Holstein Friesian dairy cows were randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments. The dietary treatments were: control, pasture only (CTRL), pasture + 2.65 kg DM barley-based concentrate + 350 IU &#945;-TOC/kg (BARLO), pasture + 2.65 kg DM oat-based concentrate + 350 IU &#945;-TOC/kg (OATLO) and pasture + 2.65 kg DM oat-based concentrate + 1050 IU &#945;-TOC/kg (OATHI). Within this randomised complete block design experiment cows were blocked on days in milk (DIM) and balanced for parity, milk yield and composition. Rennet coagulation time (RCT) was reduced in milk from cows offered OATHI compared to CTRL cows and OATLO. Concentration of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) was increased by OATHI compared to OATLO and in OATLO compared to CTRL. Supplementation with OATHI reduced individual saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in milk compared to OATLO. In conclusion, supplementing grazing dairy cows with an oat-based supplement improved total milk CLA concentration compared to pasture only. Offering a high level of &#945;-TOC (2931 IU/d) to dairy cows reduced RCT, individual SFA and increased total CLA concentration of milk compared to a lower &#945;-TOC level (738 IU &#945;-TOC/d).","McKay, Zoe C; O039,; Sullivan, Michael; Lynch, Mary B; Mulligan, Finbar J; Ma, Lu; Rajauria, Gaurav; Pierce, Karina M",J Dairy Res,24,24

Based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), a new comprehensive model, SD-UTAUT (social distancing-UTAUT), is developed to better understand relationships between the original constructs, plus personal innovativeness (PI) and information quality (IQ). It identifies the key factors affecting behavioral intention (BI) and use by examining the influence of revaluated hedonic motivation (HM) and learning value (LV) importance as mediators. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an exploratory study involving 311 learners, using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings - SD-UTAUT can be a new m-learning model in higher education. It has high predictive power and confirmed 15 out of 16 hypotheses. The most powerful relationship is between performance expectancy (PE) and HM. IQ affected LV the most, since HM the behavioral use (BU). HM impacts the use behavior (UB) more than LV, but habit (HT) affects it the most. Research limitations/implications - Because of the pandemic context, output may lack generalizability and reproducibility. Practical implications - To improve usage, staff must provide better support, course creators emphasize the objectives and competencies and developers integrate innovation. The joy and pleasure of m-learning use may stimulate the LV through interesting and interactive content, like incorporating gamification. Originality/value - The model set-up and circumstances are previously unseen. SD-UTAUT confirms ten new hypotheses and introduces the student's grade point average (GPA) as a moderator.

It is now becoming apparent that there is a pattern to these inconsistencies. A recent large trial has shown that high-dose intermittent bolus vitamin D therapy is ineffective at preventing rickets - the condition that is most unequivocally caused by vitamin D deficiency. There is a plausible biological explanation since high-dose bolus replacement induces long-term expression of the catabolic enzyme 24-hydroxylase and fibroblast growth factor 23, both of which have vitamin D inactivating effects. Meta-analyses of vitamin D supplementation in prevention of acute respiratory infection and trials in tuberculosis and other conditions also support efficacy of low dose daily maintenance rather than intermittent bolus dosing. This is particularly relevant during the current COVID-19 pandemic given the well-documented associations between COVID-19 risk and vitamin D deficiency. We would urge that clinicians take note of these findings and give strong support to widespread use of daily vitamin D supplementation.","Griffin, George; Hewison, Martin; Hopkin, Julian; Kenny, Rose Anne; Quinton, Richard; Rhodes, Jonathan; Subramanian, Sreedhar; Thickett, David",Clin Med (Lond),24,29

Predicting clinical improvement as well as mortality or severity is very important. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with the clinical improvement of COVID-19. METHODS: Overall, 74 patients receiving treatment for COVID-19 at Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital from April 6th to May 15th, 2020 were included in this study. Clinical improvement was evaluated, which defined as the decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status or discharge alive from the hospital within 28 days after admission. The clinical courses were particularly investigated and the factors related to time to clinical improvement were analyzed with the log-rank test and the Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients required oxygen support during hospitalization, 22 patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 5 patients required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. A total of 83% of cases reached clinical improvement. Longer period of time from onset to admission (&#8805;10 days) (HR, 1.057; 95% CI, 1.002-1.114), no hypertension (HR, 2.077; 95% CI, 1.006-4.287), and low D-dimer levels (<1 µg/ml) (HR, 2.372; 95% CI, 1.229-4.576) were confirmed to be significant predictive factors for time to clinical improvement. Furthermore, a lower SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy number was also a predictive factor for clinical improvement.

STUDY DESIGN: There were 207 parents of children with disabilities who completed a web-based survey about their child[ren]'s access to, and satisfaction with, therapy services during COVID-19. Parents also completed the Family-Provider Partnership Scale and the Telehealth Satisfaction Scale. Satisfaction was compared between families receiving therapies in school, early intervention, outpatient, and multiple settings. RESULTS: Forty-four percent of parents reported low satisfaction with their child[ren]'s therapy services during the pandemic. Access to telehealth positively predicted overall satisfaction and satisfaction with the family-provider partnership, whereas receiving school-based therapies negatively predicted overall satisfaction and satisfaction with the family-provider partnership. CONCLUSIONS: School-based therapies are legally mandated for eligible students, free of cost to families, integrated in the academic setting, and less burdensome on parents than other services. Thus, given the disparity in parental satisfaction regarding school-based service delivery, addressing therapy delivery in school-based settings during the duration of COVID-19 is critical for preventing increased disparities and more effectively meeting children's needs. Telehealth seems to be a promising option for continuing high-quality services during the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and for families who face barriers in accessing services in general. Future studies are warranted with larger and more diverse samples, as well as longitudinal studies that monitor service access and parent satisfaction throughout the remainder of the pandemic.","Murphy, Ashley; Pinkerton, Linzy M; Bruckner, Ellie; Risser, Heather J",J. pediatr.

Academic health centers rapidly deployed and leveraged telemedicine to permit uninterrupted care of patients. Telemedicine enjoys high patient satisfaction, yet little is known about the level of satisfaction during a crisis and to what extent patient- or visit-related factors and trust play when in-person visits are eliminated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine correlates of patients' satisfaction with a telemedicine visit. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study conducted in our single-institution, urban, academic medical center in Los Angeles, internal medicine patients aged &#8805;18 years who completed a telemedicine visit between March 10th and April 17th, 2020, were invited for a survey (n=1624). Measures included patient demographics, degree of interpersonal trust in patient-physician relationships (using the Trust in Physician Scale), and visit-related concerns. Statistical analysis used descriptive statistics, Spearman rank-order correlation, and linear and ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 1624 telemedicine visits conducted during this period, 368 (22.7%) patients participated in the survey. Across the study, respondents were very satisfied (173/365, 47.4%) or satisfied (n=129, 35.3%) with their telemedicine visit. Higher physician trust was associated with higher patient satisfaction (Spearman correlation r=0.51, P<.001). Visit-related factors with statistically significant correlation with Trust in Physician score were technical issues with the telemedicine visit (r=-0.16), concerns about privacy (r=-0.19), concerns about cost (r=-0.23), satisfaction with telemedicine convenience (r=0.41), and amount of time spent (r=0.47; all P<.01). Visit-related factors associated with patients' satisfaction included fewer technical issues (P<.001), less concern about privacy (P<.001) or cost (P=.02), and successful face-to-face video (P<.001). The only patient variable with a significant positive association was income and level of trust in physician (r=0.18, P<.001). Younger age was associated with higher satisfaction with the telemedicine visit (P=.005). CONCLUSIONS: There have been calls for redesigning primary care after the COVID-19 pandemic and for the widespread adoption of telemedicine. Patients' satisfaction with telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic is high. Their satisfaction is shaped by the degree of trust in physician and visit-related factors more so than patient factors. This has widespread implications for outpatient practices and further research into visit-related factors and the patient-provider connection over telemedicine is needed.","Orrange, Sharon; Patel, Arpna; Mack, Wendy Jean; Cassetta, Julia",JMIR Hum Factors,24,16

(2) Method: After the fourth (final) stage of defrosting the Polish economy, an online survey of a quota sample of 1013 Polish respondents was conducted. (3) Results: Almost half of the respondents (45.6%) indicated that they had engaged in at least one behavior associated with inappropriate self-medication during the lockdown (e.g., 16.6% took medication as a precaution, and 16.8% took an Rx formulation without consultation). Some of these people had never engaged in such behaviors prior to the lockdown. Linear regression showed that higher values of a composite (""lockdown"") index of self-medication-related behaviors occurring during lockdown were predicted by greater religiosity and the presence of children in a household. Also, independent samples t-tests showed that people who were afraid for their financial future and people who feared for their health obtained higher lockdown index scores than people not having such worries.

METHODS: Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted in April, June and August 2020 in low- and high-transmission neighbourhoods. Participants were selected at random to provide blood for Elecsys immunoassay for detection of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibodies. A Bayesian regression model was used to estimate seroprevalence after adjusting for the demographic characteristics of each district. RESULTS: In total, 3005 participants from 623 households were enrolled in this study. In Phase 2, adjusted seroprevalence was estimated as 8.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.1-13.1] and 15.1% (95% CI 9.4-21.7) in low- and high-transmission areas, respectively, compared with 0.2% (95% CI 0-0.7) and 0.4% (95% CI 0-1.3) in Phase 1. In Phase 3, it was 12.8% (95% CI 8.3-17.7) and 21.5% (95% CI 15.6-28) in low- and high-transmission areas, respectively. The conditional risk of infection was 0.31 (95% CI 0.16-0.47) and 0.41 (95% CI 0.28-0.52) in low- and high-transmission neighbourhoods, respectively, in Phase 2. Similar trends were observed in Phase 3. Only 5.4% of participants who tested positive for COVID-19 were symptomatic. The infection fatality rate was 1.66%, 0.37% and 0.26% in Phases 1, 2 and 3, respectively. CONCLUSION: Continuing rounds of seroprevalence studies will help to improve understanding of secular trends and the extent of infection during the course of the pandemic.","Nisar, Muhammad Imran; Ansari, Nadia; Khalid, Farah; Amin, Mashal; Shahbaz, Hamna; Hotwani, Aneeta; Rehman, Najeeb; Pugh, Sierra; Mehmood, Usma; Rizvi, Arjumand; Memon, Arslan; Ahmed, Zahoor; Ahmed, Ashfaque; Iqbal, Junaid; Saleem, Ali Faisal; Aamir, Uzma Bashir; Larremore, Daniel B; Fosdick, Bailey; Jehan, Fyezah",Int J Infect Dis,24,24

Previous studies related to the SARS pandemic showed a decrease up to 80% in the emergency care episodes. Hence, the objective of this study is to analyze the use of emergency services during the first pandemic month, compared to historical records. Methods: Data from emergency episodes in mainland Portugal, from January 2014 to March 2020, were downloaded from the National Health Service (NHS) Transparency Portal and the NHS monitoring website. The evolution of emergency services from March to September 2020 was forecasted based on historical data from January 2014 to February 2020. Information for March 2020 was forecasted globally, by the Regional Health Administration (RHA) and Manchester Triage System (MTS). Results: Compared with forecasted values, there was a 48% reduction in the number of emergency episodes in March 2020. In the analysis by the RHA, Alentejo had the smallest decrease in the number of episodes; interestingly, Alentejo is also the area with fewer COVID-19 cases in mainland Portugal. In the analysis by the MTS, the episodes classified as yellow showed the highest reduction (50%). For episodes classified as urgent, there is a difference of about 144,000 episodes during March 2020. Discussion: The results of this preliminary study are aligned with the evidence produced for previous pandemics. Data about the use of emergency services, demographic and clinical characteristics of the episodes would be relevant to analyze this reduction. Conclusion: There was a significant drop in the number of emergency service use in March 2020, and although the causes of this reduction are not determined, the association between the beginning of the pandemic and the reduction of demand is evident. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial to plan interventions to avoid unnecessary morbidities or deaths, caused by a delayed visit to the emergency department.","Santana, Rui; Sousa, Joana Santos; Soares, Patrícia; Lopes, Sílvia; Boto, Paulo; Rocha, João Victor",Port J Public Health,24,1

We aimed to characterise IgM memory B cells in patients with COVID-19 admitted to an internal medicine ward in Northern Italy. Overall, 66 COVID-19 patients (mean age 74 ± 16.6 years; 29 females) were enrolled. Three patients (4.5%; 1 female) had been splenectomised and were excluded from further analyses. Fifty-five patients (87.3%) had IgM memory B cell depletion, and 18 (28.6%) died during hospitalisation (cumulative incidence rate 9.26/100 person-week; 5.8-14.7 95% CI). All patients who died had IgM memory B cell depletion. A superimposed infection was found in 6 patients (9.5%), all of them having IgM memory B cell depletion (cumulative incidence rate 3.08/100 person-week; 1.3-6.8 95% CI). At bivariable analyses, older age, sex, number of comorbidities, and peripheral blood lymphocyte count < 1500/µl were not correlated with IgM memory B cell depletion. A discrete-to-marked reduction of the B-cell compartment was also noticed in autoptic spleen specimens of two COVID-19 patients. We conclude that IgM memory B cells are commonly depleted in COVID-19 patients and this correlates with increased mortality and superimposed infections.","Lenti, Marco Vincenzo; Aronico, Nicola; Pellegrino, Ivan; Boveri, Emanuela; Giuffrida, Paolo; Borrelli de Andreis, Federica; Morbini, Patrizia; Vanelli, Laura; Pasini, Alessandra; Ubezio, Cristina; Melazzini, Federica; Rascaroli, Alessandro; Antoci, Valentina; Merli, Stefania; Di Terlizzi, Francesco; Sabatini, Umberto; Cambiè, Ginevra; Tenore, Annamaria; Picone, Cristina; Vanoli, Alessandro; Arcaini, Luca; Baldanti, Fausto; Paulli, Marco; Corazza, Gino Roberto; Di Sabatino, Antonio",Sci Rep,24,24

Although many individuals comply with these recommendations, compliance has been far from universal. Identifying predictors of compliance is crucial for improving health behavior messaging and thereby reducing disease spread and fatalities. METHODS: We report preregistered analyses from a longitudinal study that investigated personality predictors of compliance with behavioral recommendations in diverse US adults across five waves from March to August 2020 (n = 596) and cross-sectionally in August 2020 (n = 405). RESULTS: Agreeableness-characterized by compassion-was the most consistent predictor of compliance, above and beyond other traits, and sociodemographic predictors (sample A, ß = 0.25; sample B, ß = 0.12). The effect of agreeableness was robust across two diverse samples and sensitivity analyses. In addition, openness, conscientiousness, and extraversion were also associated with greater compliance, but effects were less consistent across sensitivity analyses and were smaller in sample A.

Although many individuals comply with these recommendations, compliance has been far from universal. Identifying predictors of compliance is crucial for improving health behavior messaging and thereby reducing disease spread and fatalities. METHODS: We report preregistered analyses from a longitudinal study that investigated personality predictors of compliance with behavioral recommendations in diverse US adults across five waves from March to August 2020 (n = 596) and cross-sectionally in August 2020 (n = 405). RESULTS: Agreeableness-characterized by compassion-was the most consistent predictor of compliance, above and beyond other traits, and sociodemographic predictors (sample A, ß = 0.25; sample B, ß = 0.12). The effect of agreeableness was robust across two diverse samples and sensitivity analyses. In addition, openness, conscientiousness, and extraversion were also associated with greater compliance, but effects were less consistent across sensitivity analyses and were smaller in sample A. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who are less agreeable are at higher risk for noncompliance with behavioral mandates, suggesting that health messaging can be meaningfully improved with approaches that address these individuals in particular.

The spike glycoprotein (S) drives the entry and fusion of this virus and is the main determinant of cell tropism. To explore S requirements for entry under BSL2 conditions, S has been pseudotyped onto vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or retroviral particles with varied success. Several alterations to S were demonstrated to improve pseudoparticle titers, but they have not been systematically compared. In this study, we produced pseudotyped VSV particles with multiple modifications to S, including truncation, mutation, and tagging strategies. The main objective of this study was to determine which modifications of the S protein optimize cell surface expression, incorporation into pseudotyped particles, and pseudoparticle entry. Removal of the last 19 residues of the cytoplasmic tail produced a hyper-fusogenic S, while removal of 21 residues increased S surface production and VSV incorporation. Additionally, we engineered a replication-competent VSV (rVSV) virus to produce the S-D614G variant with a truncated cytoplasmic tail. While the particles can be used to assess S entry requirements, the rVSV&#8710;G/SMet1D614G&#8710;21 virus has a poor specific infectivity (particle to infectious titer ratio).","Havranek, Katherine Elizabeth; Jimenez, Ariana R; Acciani, Marissa Danielle; Lay Mendoza, Maria Fernanda; Reyes Ballista, Judith Mary; Diaz, Darren Austin; Brindley, Melinda Ann",Viruses,24,21

Such an examination is rare in the extant literature and it is timely given the increasing debate concerning the stimulus versus inflationary effects arising from wage polices because of COVID-19 global pandemic. We apply the autoregressive distributed lag model to determine the causal relationship between these variables. We find one long-run cointegrating relationship that runs from the real minimum wage to the real retail trade sales. In addition, we find that a 1% increase in the minimum wage is associated with almost a 0.5% increase in real retail trade sales in the long run. While our findings rest on several statistical assumptions, there is strong evidence in support of the position that minimum wage strengthens aggregate consumer spending, and thereby the standard of living, economic growth and stability. This is a position that differs from the conclusions drawn from mainstream academic and policy debates on the economic usefulness and efficacy of minimum wage increases.

Many researchers in different countries note that representatives of the information younger generations have an increased risk of depression, anxiety and fears. In the study, we note the manifestations of modernity: transitivity of society, fluidity, ""uncertainty""and etc. In this regard, young people face fluid socialization, a delay in the period of growing up and excessive parental care. There is a tendency of replacement of real contacts of young people with virtual ones, which can increase the level of anxiety. The trends of changing values in Russia in the direction of survival established earlier by Inglehart and Baker (2000) may have different prospects today. Some researchers show a high level of anxiety among young Russians. The situation with COVID-19 may aggravate these manifestations. Illusory correlations, false representations in the beliefs of young people also increase social anxiety. These realities determined the purpose of the study: to determine the value bases of young generations fears of the modern South of Russia. The sample included: schoolchildren (born in 2004-2005) - 150 people, schoolchildren of the 9th grade and 10th grade, information generation (born in 1995-1999) - 210 people, students, young workers, transition generation (born in 1965-1982) - 245 people, working adults of Rostov-on-Don.

In the Polya framework, we provide both the distribution of infected cases and the asymptotic estimation of the incidence rate, showing that data are consistent with a general underlying process at different scales. Using European confirmed cases and diagnostic test data on COVID-19 , we provided an extensive comparison among European countries and between Europe and Italy at regional scale, for both the two big waves of infection.

App-based contact tracing has the potential to optimize the resources of overstretched public health departments. However, its efficiency is dependent on widespread adoption. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the uptake of the Australian Government's COVIDSafe app among Australians and examine the reasons why some Australians have not downloaded the app. METHODS: An online national survey, with representative quotas for age and gender, was conducted between May 8 and May 11, 2020. Participants were excluded if they were a health care professional or had been tested for COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 1802 potential participants contacted, 289 (16.0%) were excluded prior to completing the survey, 13 (0.7%) declined, and 1500 (83.2%) participated in the survey. Of the 1500 survey participants, 37.3% (n=560) had downloaded the COVIDSafe app, 18.7% (n=280) intended to do so, 27.7% (n=416) refused to do so, and 16.3% (n=244) were undecided. Equally proportioned reasons for not downloading the app included privacy (165/660, 25.0%) and technical concerns (159/660, 24.1%). Other reasons included the belief that social distancing was sufficient and the app was unnecessary (111/660, 16.8%), distrust in the government (73/660, 11.1%), and other miscellaneous responses (eg, apathy and following the decisions of others) (73/660, 11.1%). In addition, knowledge about COVIDSafe varied among participants, as some were confused about its purpose and capabilities. CONCLUSIONS: For the COVIDSafe app to be accepted by the public and used correctly, public health messages need to address the concerns of citizens, specifically privacy, data storage, and technical capabilities. Understanding the specific barriers preventing the uptake of contact tracing apps provides the opportunity to design targeted communication strategies aimed at strengthening public health initiatives, such as downloading and correctly using contact tracing apps.","Thomas, Rae; Michaleff, Zoe A; Greenwood, Hannah; Abukmail, Eman; Glasziou, Paul",JMIR Public Health Surveill,24,1

METHODS: A total of 753 consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to the West Campus of Wuhan Union Hospital from January 22, 2020 to May 7, 2020 were enrolled in this study. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were extracted from the electronic medical records of Wuhan Union Hospital and were exhaustively analyzed using R (version 3.6.1). RESULTS: A total of 493 severe and 228 critical cases out of 753 COVID-19 cases were considered in this study. Among the critical cases, the death rate was 79.4%, and age was a risk factor for death. Compared to the severe disease group, the critical disease group had higher white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts and a decreased lymphocyte count at admission. Compared to early death cases (death within 1 week after admission), a more prolonged course of the disease was associated with a higher risk of hypoproteinemia, liver injury, thrombocytopenia, anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), coagulation disorders, acute kidney injury (AKI), and infection. Higher creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were related to early death events, but univariate and multivariate analyses confirmed only LDH as an independent predictor of early death. Notably, anticoagulation therapy was associated with an improved prognosis of critical cases in this cohort. CONCLUSION: Our results showed large differences between patients with severe and critical COVID-19. During the course of COVID-19 in the critical disease group, the incidence of hypoproteinemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulation disorders increased significantly, which highlighted the importance of medical care in the first week after admission. LDH could act as an independent predictor of early death in critical cases, and anticoagulation therapy was correlated with an improved prognosis of patients with critical COVID-19.","Chen, Zhaohui; Hu, Junyi; Liu, Lilong; Zhang, Youpeng; Liu, Dandan; Xiong, Ming; Zhao, Yi; Chen, Ke; Wang, Yu-Mei",,24,20

Early identification and isolation of patients in the preliminary infective stage has been a mainstay of most governmental strategies in order to limit transmission. Four otherwise healthy patients presented to a specialist open access Ear, Nose & Throat Clinic in central London with acute total or subtotal loss of their sense of smell in a single one-week period, coinciding with rapid escalation of COVID-19 infection in the indigenous population.

Covid-19 antibody testing carried out 6 to 8 weeks after the onset of nasal symptoms showed positive immunoglobulin G antibodies in 3 of the 4 patients. Acute severe anosmia is therefore almost certainly an unusual presenting local nasal feature of a COVID-19 viral infection.

Persistent viral infections are commonly accompanied by immunologic dysregulation, but it is unclear if persistent COVID-19 impacts the development of virus-specific cellular immunity. To this end, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular immunity in convalescent COVID-19 patients who experienced eight days or fewer of COVID-19 symptoms or symptoms persisting for 18 days or more. We observed that persistent COVID-19 symptoms were not associated with the development of an overtly dysregulated cellular immune response. Furthermore, we observed that reactivity against the N protein from SARS-CoV-2 correlates with the amount of reactivity against the seasonal human coronaviruses 229E and NL63.

Objective: To estimate the degree to which expanding fecal immunochemical test-based colorectal cancer screening participation during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with clinical outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: A previously developed simulation model was adopted to estimate how much COVID-19 may have contributed to colorectal cancer outcomes. The model included the US population estimated to have completed colorectal cancer screening pre-COVID-19 according the American Cancer Society. The model was designed to estimate colorectal cancer outcomes between 2020 and 2023. This analysis was completed between July and December 2020. Exposures: Adults screened for colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer cases detected by stage. Main Outcomes and Measures: Estimates of colorectal cancer outcomes across 4 scenarios: (1) 9 months of 50% colorectal cancer screenings followed by 21 months of 75% colorectal cancer screenings; (2) 18 months of 50% screening followed by 12 months of 75% screening; (3) scenario 1 with increased use of fecal immunochemical tests; and (4) scenario 2 with increased use of fecal immunochemical tests. Results: In our simulation model, COVID-19-related reductions in care utilization resulted in an estimated 1â¯176â¯942 to 2â¯014â¯164 fewer colorectal cancer screenings, 8346 to 12â¯894 fewer colorectal cancer diagnoses, and 6113 to 9301 fewer early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses between 2020 and 2023. With an abbreviated period of reduced colorectal cancer screenings, increasing fecal immunochemical test use was associated with an estimated additional 588â¯844 colorectal cancer screenings and 2836 colorectal cancer diagnoses, of which 1953 (68.9%) were early stage. In the event of a prolonged period of reduced colorectal cancer screenings, increasing fecal immunochemical test use was associated with an estimated additional 655â¯825 colorectal cancer screenings and 2715 colorectal cancer diagnoses, of which 1944 (71.6%) were early stage. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that the increased use of fecal immunochemical tests during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased colorectal cancer screening participation and more colorectal cancer diagnoses at earlier stages. If our estimates are borne out in real-world clinical practice, increasing fecal immunochemical test-based colorectal cancer screening participation during the COVID-19 pandemic could mitigate the consequences of reduced screening rates during the pandemic for colorectal cancer outcomes.","Issaka, Rachel B; Taylor, Preston; Baxi, Anand; Inadomi, John M; Ramsey, Scott D; Roth, Joshua",JAMA Netw Open,24,26

(2) To compare the histologic distribution of USPIO-related iron particles (USPIO-IPs) with the USPIO-enhancement area in the early vascular and in the cellular imaging phase (E- and L-phase, respectively) after intravenous CA administration. METHODS: We performed USPIO-enhanced MRI of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced endogenous rat glioma, including spin-echo (SE) T1-weighted images (T1WIs) and gradient-recalled-echo (GRE) T2-weighted images (T2WIs), before and at 3-6 h after USPIO-CA administration for E-phase images. For L-phase images, MRI was performed at 16-19 and 62-69 h after administration. Two observers determined the USPIO-enhancement area on E-phase images and Gd-enhancement areas. We compared the USPIO-enhancement size (USPIO-ES) and Gd-ES on SE T1WIs, and the hypo-intense USPIO-ES on GRE T2WIs and Gd-ES using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. In addition, two raters visually evaluated the correspondence between the histologic distribution of USPIO-IPs and the USPIO-enhancement area on corresponding GRE T2WIs at each phase using a 3-rating scale. RESULTS: Significantly smaller hyper-intense, hypo-intense and combined hyper-/hypo-intense areas were observed on USPIO-enhanced SE T1WIs compared with Gd-enhanced images (all P < 0.001). The hypo-intense USPIO-ES on GRE T2WIs was significantly smaller than the Gd-ES (P = 0.001). The distribution of USPIO-IPs on histopathological specimen and USPIO-enhancement on GRE T2WIs exhibited poor agreement in 5 of 9 tumors with enhancement from rats sacrificed early. The distribution of microglia containing USPIO-IPs corresponded with the pattern of USPIO-enhancement in the 2 tumors with late enhancement. CONCLUSION: The enhancement pattern and size of USPIO-CA in a rat glioma model were statistically different from those of Gd-BCA. Our histological data suggests that USPIO-enhanced MRI offers vascular bed imaging in E-phase and might depict the intra-tumoral distribution of immune effector cells in L-phase.","Yamamoto, Atsuko; Takaki, Kai; Morikawa, Shigehiro; Murata, Kiyoshi; Ito, Ryuta",,24,16

Acceptance of this conclusion goes easily with stressed importance of vitality, movement and creativity of thought - but what about death? Is death even allowed in educational practice? As this paper is written during the emergence of a pandemic, the question goes even further: could education and aesthetics even be of any concern if the danger of death ""do us part""?

293065,293065,293065,Survival rate in hypertensive patients with COVID-19,16.895824,7.7091246,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the pandemic, remote consultations have become the norm for assessing patients with signs and symptoms of COVID-19 to decrease the risk of transmission. This has intensified the clinical uncertainty already experienced by primary care clinicians when assessing suspected COVID-19 patients and has prompted the use of risk prediction scores, such as NEWS2, to assess severity and guide treatment. However, the risk prediction tools available have not been validated in a community setting and are not designed to capture the idiosyncrasy of COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to produce a multivariate risk prediction tool (RECAP-V1) to support primary care clinicians in the identification of those COVID-19 patients that are at higher risk of deterioration and facilitate the early escalation of their treatment with the aim of improving patient outcomes. METHODS: The study follows a prospective cohort observational design, whereby patients presenting in primary care with signs and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 will be followed and their data linked to hospital outcomes (hospital admission and death). Data collection will be carried out by primary care clinicians in four arms, i.e., North West London Clinical Commissioning Groups (NWL CCGs), Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC), Covid Clinical Assessment Service (CCAS) and South East London CCGs (Doctaly platform) and involves the use of an electronic template that incorporates a list of items (known as RECAP-V0) thought to be associated with disease outcome according to previous qualitative work. Data collected will be linked to patient outcomes in highly secure environments (iCARE and ORCHID). We will then use multivariate logistic regression analyses for model development and validation. RESULTS: Recruitment of participants started in October 2020. Initially, only NWL CCGs and RCGP RSC arms were active. As of 24th of March 2021, we have recruited a combined sample of 3,827 participants in these two arms. CCAS and Doctaly joined the study in February 2021, with CCAS starting recruitment process on the 15th of March 2021. The first part of the analysis (RECAP-V1 model development) is planned to start in April 2021 using the first half of the NWL CCGs and RCGP RSC combined dataset. Posteriorly, the model will be validated with the rest of NWL CCGs and RCGP RSC data as well as CCAS and Doctaly datasets. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee on the 27th of May 2020 (IRAS number 283024, REC reference number: 20/NW/0266) and badged as NIHR Urgent Public Health Study on 14th of October 2020. CONCLUSIONS: We believe the validated RECAP-V1 early warning score will be a valuable tool for the assessment of suspected COVID-19 patients' severity in the community, either in face-to-face or remote consultations, and will facilitate the timely escalation of treatment with the potential to improve patient outcomes.

Comorbidity-like hypertension has been among the major risks of coronary artery disease. Recent evidence identified multiple benefits of cardiovascular nursing care to coronary patients. However, little has been appraised on benefits regarding patients' blood pressure control and length of hospitalisation. Objective: To compare the association of cardiovascular nursing care delivered to coronary artery patients with patients' blood pressure and length of stay. Methods: Records based retrospective design was applied at a large teaching hospital in Wuhan, China. SPSS 21 version was used for data entry and analysis with univariate and multivariate logistic regression models for comparing study variables. Results: Of 300 patients, 224 (74.7%) were known to be hypertensive and admitted with subnormal blood pressure. Cardiovascular nursing care like ""assess to grade pain severity on 1-10 scale"" and ""counsel patient to cope with stress"" were six and three times more likely to contribute improved patients' blood pressure (AOR=5.8; 95%CI: 2.8-12.2, p=0.001) and (AOR=3.1; 95%CI: 1.2-7.8, p=0.015) respectively. No significant difference with length of stay (p>0.05). Conclusion: There is a possibility of coronary artery patients to recover with normal blood pressure following reception of evidence-based cardiovascular nursing care.","Ramadhani, Fatina B; Liu, Yilan; Jing, Xue; Qing, Ye; Xiong, Han; Zhang, Fengjian; Wei, Pian",Afr Health Sci,24,26

Measurement by serological correlates without biocontainment needs, and an understanding of donor characteristics that may allow for targeting of more potent donors would greatly facilitate effective collection. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred convalescent plasma units were characterized for functionally active SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, as well as for SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies, with the intention to establish a correlation between the functionally more relevant neutralization assay and the more accessible ELISA. Donor demographics such as COVID-19 disease severity, age and sex were correlated with antibody titers. RESULTS: A mean neutralization titer 50% of 1:230 (range < 1:8 - 1:1765) was seen for the 100 convalescent plasma units, with highly significant (p < 0.0001), yet quantitatively limited (R2 = 0.2830) correlation with results of the ELISA. Exclusion of units with particularly high titers (>1:500) from analysis improved correlation (R2 = 0.5386). A tendency of higher titer plasma units from donors with increased disease severity, advanced age and of male sex was seen, yet the functional relevance of this difference is questionable. CONCLUSION: The ELISA-based correlation to neutralization titer enabled a threshold proposal that could be used to eliminate lower titer units from the clinical supply for COVID-19 treatment. Disease severity may be associated with the development of higher titers of neutralizing antibodies, although larger case numbers will be needed for additional confirmation.

METHODS: We performed an analysis assessing the utility of apical lung exam on computed tomography angiography for COVID-19-specific lung findings in 57 patients presenting with AIS. We measured the diagnostic accuracy of apical lung assessment alone and in combination with patient-reported symptoms and incorporate both to propose a COVID-19 era AIS algorithm. RESULTS: Apical lung assessment when used in isolation, yielded a sensitivity of 0.67, specificity of 0.93, positive predictive value of 0.19, negative predictive value of 0.99, and accuracy of 0.92 for the diagnosis of COVID-19, in patients presenting to the hospital for AIS. When combined with self-reported clinical symptoms of cough or shortness of breath, sensitivity of apical lung assessment improved to 0.83. CONCLUSIONS: Apical lung assessment on computed tomography angiography is an accurate screening tool for COVID-19 and can serve as part of a combined screening approach in AIS.","Esenwa, Charles; Lee, Ji-Ae; Nisar, Taha; Shmukler, Anna; Goldman, Inessa; Zampolin, Richard; Hsu, Kevin; Labovitz, Daniel; Altschul, David; Haramati, Linda B",Stroke,24,1

Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy was used as a guideline for conducting this systematic review. We searched peer-reviewed and preprint articles in PubMed, BioRxiv and MedRxiv up to 28 September 2020 to identify studies that provide data to calculate sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) was applied for assessing quality of included studies and Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA) was followed for reporting. We included 81 studies from 65 research articles on POCTs of SARS, MERS and COVID-19. Most studies had high risk of patient selection and index test bias but low risk in other domains. Diagnostic specificities were high (> 0.95) for included studies while sensitivities varied depending on type of assays and sample used. Most studies (n = 51) used reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to diagnose coronaviruses. RT-LAMP of RNA purified from COVID-19 patient samples had pooled sensitivity at 0.94 (95% CI: 0.90-0.96). RT-LAMP of crude samples had substantially lower sensitivity at 0.78 (95% CI: 0.65-0.87). Abbott ID Now performance was similar to RT-LAMP of crude samples. Diagnostic performances by CRISPR and RT-LAMP on purified RNA were similar. Other diagnostic platforms including RT- recombinase assisted amplification (RT-RAA) and SAMBA-II also offered high sensitivity (> 0.95).

The association with hepatic steatosis, however, a condition closely related to obesity within the spectrum of systemic metabolic dysfunctions, remains to be elucidated. We aimed to evaluate the frequency of hepatic steatosis as incidentally detected in chest CT examinations of COVID-19 positive patients in comparison to non-infected controls. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed with 316 patients (204 RT-PCR positive; 112 RT-PCR negative and chest CT negative). Steatosis was measured with placement of a single ROI in the right lobe of the liver (segments VI-VII) and defined as a liver attenuation value &#8804; 40 HU. RESULTS: The frequency of hepatic steatosis was higher in the RT-PCR positive group in comparison to controls (31.9% vs. 7.1%, p < 0.001). Logistic linear regression analysis showed a 4.7 times odds of steatosis in the COVID-19 positive group as compared to controls after adjusting for age and sex (OR 4.698; 95% IC 2.12-10.41, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A significantly higher prevalence of steatosis was found among COVID-19 positive individuals. These findings are in accordance with other recent studies linking obesity and COVID-19 infection, as there is an intricate relationship between liver steatosis, metabolic syndrome and obesity. Further studies are required to confirm if such association remains after accounting for multiple variables, as well as possible relationships with disease severity and worst clinical outcomes.","Medeiros, Augusto Kreling; Barbisan, Cinthia Callegari; Cruz, Italo Ribeiro; de Araújo, Eduardo Medeiros; Libânio, Bruna Brandão; Albuquerque, Kamila Seidel; Torres, Ulysses S",Abdom Radiol (NY),24,1

Both statistical uncertainties and systematic errors are associated with the calibration process, which would in turn affect the analysis of detected sources, if not accounted for. Currently, source characterization algorithms either entirely neglect the possibility of calibration uncertainties or account for them in a way that does not use knowledge of the calibration process itself. We present physiCal, a new approach to account for calibration errors during the source characterization step, which directly uses all the information available about the instrument calibration process. Rather than modeling the overall detector's response function, we consider the individual components that contribute to the response. We implement this method and apply it to the compact binaries detected by LIGO and Virgo during the second observation run, as well as to simulated binary neutron stars for which the sky position and distance are known exactly. We find that the physiCal model performs as well as the method currently used within the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, but additionally it enables improving the measurement of specific components of the instrument control through astrophysical calibration.","Vitale, Salvatore; Haster, Carl-Johan; Sun, Ling; Farr, Ben; Goetz, Evan; Kissel, Jeff; Cahillane, Craig",,24,9

In this article we explore how assessment changed in the initial semester of emergency remote teaching in an Australian university. Seventy academics responsible for courses (unit of study), representing a wide array of disciplines, completed an online survey at the end of the semester in June 2020. They answered questions regarding their experiences and actions in shifting their course online from face-to-face delivery at the point of the pivot online. A mixed methods approach identified that most academics did not change the composition and relative weighting of their assessment in response to the pivot. The dominant strategy was to translate existing on-campus assessment into an online format. The research provides insight into disciplinary norms for assessment and, we argue, signals how forms of assessment are valued based on their retention during a time of consequential change in pedagogy. For academics in our study, assessment was an afterthought to the more pressing focus on pedagogical interactions with students. Academic integrity matters were not a factor in their decision-making process during that initial move to remote emergency teaching.

In addition, they allow monitoring infectious sides and treatment responses using noninvasive imaging modalities. While intranasal delivery was proposed as the preferred administration route for therapeutic agents against viral pulmonary diseases, NP-based delivery systems offer numerous benefits to overcome challenges associated with mucosal administration, and ensure that these agents achieve a concentration that is many times higher than expected in the targeted sites of infection while limiting side effects on normal cells.

Cumulative and monthly age-adjusted COVID-19 proportionate hospitalization ratios (aPHRs) were calculated for racial and ethnic minority patients relative to non-Hispanic White patients. Within each of the four U.S. Census regions, the cumulative aPHR was highest for Hispanic or Latino patients (range = 2.7-3.9). Racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 hospitalization were largest during May-July 2020; the peak monthly aPHR among Hispanic or Latino patients was >9.0 in the West and Midwest, >6.0 in the South, and >3.0 in the Northeast. The aPHRs declined for most racial and ethnic groups during July-November 2020 but increased for some racial and ethnic groups in some regions during December.

A prime example is the transcript isoform switch that leads to the read-through expression of the long non-coding RNA NEAT1_2, at the expense of the shorter polyadenylated transcript NEAT1_1 NEAT1_2 is required for assembly of paraspeckles (PS), nuclear bodies that protect cancer cells from oncogene-induced replication stress and chemotherapy. Searching for proteins that modulate this event, we identified factors involved in the 3' end processing of polyadenylated RNA and components of the Integrator complex. Perturbation experiments established that, by promoting the cleavage of NEAT1_2, Integrator forces NEAT1_2 to NEAT1_1 isoform switching and, thereby, restrains PS assembly. Consistently, low levels of Integrator subunits correlated with poorer prognosis of cancer patients exposed to chemotherapeutics. Our study establishes that Integrator regulates PS biogenesis and a link between Integrator, cancer biology, and chemosensitivity, which may be exploited therapeutically.","Barra, Jasmine; Gaidosh, Gabriel S; Blumenthal, Ezra; Beckedorff, Felipe; Tayari, Mina M; Kirstein, Nina; Karakach, Tobias K; Jensen, Torben Heick; Impens, Francis; Gevaert, Kris; Leucci, Eleonora; Shiekhattar, Ramin; Marine, Jean-Christophe",Sci.

To overcome the delivery challenge in shuttling highly polar STING agonists, typically in the form of cyclic dinucleotides, to target cells and to STING proteins in cellular cytosol, numerous nanoformulation strategies have been implemented for effective STING activation. While many STING-activating nanoparticles are developed to enhance anticancer immunotherapy, their adoption as vaccine adjuvant has vastly propelled antiviral vaccination efforts against challenging public health threats, including HIV, influenza and coronaviruses.

METHOD: A survey questionnaire consisting of post-traumatic stress disorder self-rating scale (PTSD-SS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) was presented to COVID-19 survivors still in quarantine. Scores of each scale and subscale were dependent variables in the Mann-Whitney test and stepwise regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 126 subjects were included in the study, the mean scores of PTSD-SS, SDS, and SAS were 45.5 ± 18.9, 47.3 ± 13.1, and 43.2 ± 10.2, respectively, meanwhile, 9 (31.0%), 28 (22.2%), and 48 (38.1%) of the survivors met the cut-score for clinical significant symptoms of stress response, anxiety, and depression, respectively. Infected family members, and postinfection physical discomforts were significantly associated with scores on all three scales. Social support, retirement, and being female had significant associations with the PTSD-SS score. The survivors aged 60 or above experienced less severe stress response symptoms, fewer emotional symptoms of depression, and fewer anxiety symptoms than younger survivors. CONCLUSION: The occurrence rate of psychological distress among the COVID-19 survivors in early convalescence was high, highlighting the need for all COVID-19 survivors to be screened for psychological distress regularly for timely intervention. The predictors indicated by the current study may help to identify those at high-risk. Besides, the results indicated the older survivors suffered less emotional reactivity and fewer stress response symptoms from infectious diseases than the younger ones.","Cai, Xin; Hu, Xiaopeng; Ekumi, Ivo Otte; Wang, Jianchun; An, Yawen; Li, Zhiwen; Yuan, Bo",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,24,16

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted by distributing online questionnaires to 2430 adult members (> 18 years) of two user panels consisting of people with diabetes who have volunteered to share information about their life with diabetes. The questionnaire included items on COVID-19-specific worries as well as such worries related to diabetes, sociodemographic and health status, social relations, diabetes-specific social support, diabetes distress and changes in diabetes-specific behaviours. Responses were analysed with descriptive statistics and logistic regressions. RESULTS: People with diabetes have COVID-19-specific worries related to their diabetes. More than half were worried about being overly affected due to diabetes if infected with COVID-19, about one-third about being characterized as a risk group due to diabetes and not being able to manage diabetes if infected. Logistic regressions showed that being female, having type 1 diabetes, diabetes complications and diabetes distress, feeling isolated and lonely, and having changed diabetes behaviours were associated with being more worried about COVID-19 and diabetes. CONCLUSION: People with diabetes have COVID-19-specific worries related to their diabetes which is associated with poorer psychosocial health. These worries should be addressed through support targeting specific questions and needs of individuals with diabetes as well as frequent updates on new knowledge regarding COVID-19 and diabetes.","Joensen, L E; Madsen, K P; Holm, L; Nielsen, K A; Rod, M H; Petersen, A A; Rod, N H; Willaing, I",Diabet Med,24,2

This article offers an original evaluation of the Law in its political context. The Law commendably promises to safeguard the right to health, assist citizens to live a 'complete cycle of life', and promote health using the resources of the public health system. However, it is also deeply politicised, guaranteeing extensive and penetrative political control in health campaigns, digitalised health data, the governance of health institutions, and the resolution of medical disputes. This can be explained by the consequential roles played by epidemics in China's historical dynastic cycles, but even more so by powerful tendencies of centralisation on the part of the Leninist Party-state. The Law's potential is thus subject to the overriding caveat that the Party-state's existence and influence over law and public health must be secured.","Ip, Eric C",Med. law rev,24,12

Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the reproductive numbers (R) for each epidemic stage to analyze the effects of the preventive measures and to predict the COVID-19 transmission trends. METHODS: We estimated the transmission rates for each epidemic stage by fitting a COVID-19 transmission model, based on a deterministic mathematical model, to the data on confirmed cases. The effects of preventive measures such as social distancing by time period were analyzed, and the size and trends of future COVID-19 outbreaks were estimated. RESULTS: The value of R was 3.53 from February18, 2020 to February 28, 2020, and the mean R reduced to 0.45 from March 14, 2020 to April 29, 2020, but it significantly increased to 2.69 from April 30, 2020 to May13, 2020 and it was maintained at 1.03 from May 14, 2020 to July 23, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: According to the estimated R, it had fallen to below 1 and was maintained at that level owing to the isolation of infected persons by the public health authorities and social distancing measures followed by the general public. Then, the estimated R increased rapidly as the contact among individuals increased during the long holiday period from April 30, 2020 to May 5, 2020. Thereafter, the value of R dropped, with the continued use of preventive measures but remained higher than 1.00, indicating that the COVID-19 outbreak can be prolonged and develop into a severe outbreak at any time.","Choi, Sunhwa; Ki, Moran",Epidemiol Health,24,1

Design/methodology/approach: This paper explores changes in engagement and learning in a survey-level history course on the black death after a shift to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors used activity theory to focus the adaptation of Net.Create, a web-based collaborative social-network-analysis tool and to understand how it supported group-based remote learning. The authors describe how the redesigned activities sustained engagement with historical content and report coded student network entries, reading responses and surveys to illustrate changes in engagement and learning. Findings: The results suggest that students benefit from personal connections to historical content and their peers. Net.Create supported both through collaborative knowledge-building activities and reflection on how their quarantine experiences compared to the historical content they read. It is possible to avoid student frustrations with traditional “group work” even in a remote environment by supporting collaborative learning using Net.Create and a mix of individual and group contributions.

The recommended interval between doses is 21 days for Pfizer-BioNTech and 28 days for Moderna; however, up to 42 days between doses is permissible when a delay is unavoidable.§ Two analyses of COVID-19 vaccine administration data were conducted among persons who initiated the vaccination series during December 14, 2020-February 14, 2021, and whose doses were reported to CDC through February 20, 2021. The first analysis was conducted to determine whether persons who received a first dose and had sufficient time to receive the second dose (i.e., as of February 14, 2021, >25 days from receipt of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or >32 days from receipt of Moderna vaccine had elapsed) had received the second dose. A second analysis was conducted among persons who received a second COVID-19 dose by February 14, 2021, to determine whether the dose was received during the recommended dosing interval, which in this study was defined as 17-25 days (Pfizer-BioNTech) and 24-32 days (Moderna) after the first dose. Analyses were stratified by jurisdiction and by demographic characteristics. In the first analysis, among 12,496,258 persons who received the first vaccine dose and for whom sufficient time had elapsed to receive the second dose, 88.0% had completed the series, 8.6% had not received the second dose but remained within the allowable interval (&#8804;42 days since the first dose), and 3.4% had missed the second dose (outside the allowable interval, >42 days since the first dose). The percentage of persons who missed the second dose varied by jurisdiction (range = 0.0%-9.1%) and among demographic groups was highest among non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons (5.1%) and persons aged 16-44 years (4.0%).

As of today, more than 46 million people have been infected and over 1.2 million fatalities. With the purpose of contributing to the development of effective therapeutics, we performed an in silico determination of binding hot-spots and an assessment of their druggability within the complete SARS-CoV-2 proteome. All structural, non-structural, and accessory proteins have been studied, and whenever experimental structural data of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were not available, homology models were built based on solved SARS-CoV structures. Several potential allosteric or protein-protein interaction druggable sites on different viral targets were identified, knowledge that could be used to expand current drug discovery endeavors beyond the currently explored cysteine proteases and the polymerase complex. It is our hope that this study will support the efforts of the scientific community both in understanding the molecular determinants of this disease and in widening the repertoire of viral targets in the quest for repurposed or novel drugs against COVID-19.","Cavasotto, Claudio N; Lamas, Maximiliano Sánchez; Maggini, Julián",Eur J Pharmacol,24,16

The aim of this study was to evaluate the consequences of COVID-19 on the IBD Unit's activity and provide information on restructuring with available resources. METHODS: an observational study was performed in a referral hospital in Madrid (Spain). Type of appointment, loss of follow-up, hospital admission, treatment changes, endoscopic activity, surgeries and blood tests were evaluated between March 15th and May 15th, 2020. This data was compared with the usual activity a year before. RESULTS: among the 510 patients included, 476 (93.33 %) received had a remote consultation, representing an increase of 92.38 % compared with the previous year (0.95 %). There was a loss of follow-up in 26 patients (5.1 %) vs 15 (3.58 %) the previous year. A total of 60 (35.09 %) blood tests, 64 (76.19 %) endoscopies and all scheduled surgeries were suspended. Besides, 484 (94.9 %) patients remained adherent vs 417/419 (99.5 %) in the pre-pandemic period and 48 (9.41 %) reported symptoms of an IBD flare. Thirty-nine (7.6 %) patients developed symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: a large number of tests and on-site outpatient visit consultations were suspended. However, a rapid adaptation to telemedicine allowed these patients to be closely followed up. Although it was possible to maintain therapeutic compliance, with a loss to follow-up slightly higher than the previous year, suspensions and delays of tests could have significant negative consequences in the long term.","El Hajra, Ismael; Calvo, Marta; Santos Pérez, Elena; Blanco Rey, Santiago; González Partida, Irene; Matallana, Virginia; González-Lama, Yago; Vera, María Isabel",Rev. esp. enferm. dig,24,15

The pharmaceutical cold chain, in particular, is a complex and sensitive chain that needs to be managed effectively based on its direct effects on public health and peoples & rsquo;life. Blockchain technology as an emerging distributed solution has been attracting proliferating studies over recent years. The main objective of this paper is to address how blockchain would meet the requirements of a pharmaceutical cold chain such as pharmaceutical digital identity, serialization and traceability, data integrity, trans-parency, and waste management. Besides, we reviewed the current limitations of the blockchain-enabled pharmaceutical chain to provide deep insights into the existing research challenges and clarify future study directions. Moreover, different case studies of blockchain-based pharmaceutical and medicine projects that deal with these challenges for diverse purposes are discussed. This study represents the various solutions by which blockchain technology would help attain the pharmaceutical cold chain objectives. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Bamakan, S. M.

The lipid enters the human gastrointestinal tract through external source and internal source. The absorption pathway of lipids in the gastrointestinal tract has many ways; the 1st way, the lipid molecules are digested in the lumen before go through the enterocytes, digested products are re-esterified into complex lipid molecules. The 2nd way, the intracellular lipids are accumulated into lipoproteins (chylomicrons) which transport lipids throughout the whole body. The lipids are re-synthesis again inside the human body where the gastrointestinal lipids are: (1) Transferred into the endoplasmic reticulum; (2) Collected as lipoproteins such as chylomicrons; or (3) Stored as lipid droplets in the cytosol. The lipids play an important role in many stages of the viral replication cycle. The specific lipid change occurs during viral infection in advanced viral replication cycle. There are 47 lipids within 11 lipid classes were significantly disturbed after viral infection. The virus connects with blood-borne lipoproteins and apolipoprotein E to change viral infectivity.

Urgent studies to identify new antiviral drugs, repurpose existing drugs, or identify drugs that can target the overactive immune response are ongoing. Antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) have been tested in past human coronavirus infections, and also against SARS-CoV-2, but a trial of lopinavir and ritonavir failed to show any clinical benefit in COVID-19. However, there is limited data as to the course of COVID-19 in people living with HIV, with some studies showing a decreased mortality for those taking certain ARV regimens. We hypothesized that ARVs other than lopinavir and ritonavir might be responsible for some protection against the progression of COVID-19. Here, we used chemoinformatic analyses to predict which ARVs would bind and potentially inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) or RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) enzymes in silico. The drugs predicted to bind the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro included the protease inhibitors atazanavir and indinavir. The ARVs predicted to bind the catalytic site of the RdRp included Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors, abacavir, emtricitabine, zidovudine, and tenofovir. Existing or new combinations of antiretroviral drugs could potentially prevent or ameliorate the course of COVID-19 if shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in clinical trials.

OBJECTIVES: We estimated the association between patients' characteristics and COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation and adverse outcome in Mexico. METHODS: This retrospective case series used a publicly available nation-level dataset released on May 31, 2020 by the Mexican Ministry of Health, with patients classified as suspected cases of viral respiratory disease. Patients with COVID-19 were laboratory-confirmed. Their profile was stratified by COVID-19 diagnosis or not. Differences among COVID-19 patients based on two separate clinical endpoints, hospitalisation and adverse outcome, were examined. Multivariate logistic regressions examined the associations between patient characteristics and hospitalisation and adverse outcome. RESULTS: Overall, 236â439 patients were included, with 89â756 (38.0%) being diagnosed with COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were disproportionately older, males and with increased prevalence of one or more comorbidities, particularly diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Age, male gender, diabetes, obesity and having one or more comorbidities were independently associated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Current smokers were 23% less likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to non-smokers. Of all COVID-19 patients, 34.8% were hospitalised and 13.0% experienced an adverse outcome. Male gender, older age, having one or more comorbidities, and chronic renal disease, diabetes, obesity, COPD, immunosuppression and hypertension were associated with hospitalisation and adverse outcome. Current smoking was not associated with adverse outcome. CONCLUSION: This largest ever case series of COVID-19 patients identified risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation and adverse outcome. The findings could provide insight for the priorities the need to be set, especially by LMICs, to tackle the pandemic.","Giannouchos, Theodoros V; Sussman, Roberto A; Mier, José M; Poulas, Konstantinos; Farsalinos, Konstantinos",Eur. respir. j,24,24

Following government-implemented regulations, there has been concern over the apparent decline in emergency department (ED) attendances and the resultant health legacy. Therefore, we aimed to characterise the attendances to an Irish tertiary hospital ED following the implementation of these regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective observational study investigated all attendances to the Cork University Hospital ED from 15 February to 11 April in 2020 and 2017-2019. Attendances were stratified into four periods: Before COVID (BC) (15 February to 5 March), After COVID (AC) (6 March to 12 March), Educational Closure (EC) (13 March to 27 March) and Stay Home (SH) (28 March to 11 April), as per government regulations. Triage presentations of abdominal pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, headache and trauma were examined. Data were analysed by independent t-tests and &#967;2 analysis. RESULTS: There were 8261 attendances to the ED in the 2020 time period compared with a mean of 10 389 attendances during the corresponding periods in 2017-2019. There was a significant decrease in daily attendances in 2020 compared with 2017-2019 in the AC (142 vs 188, p=0.02), EC (122 vs 184, p<0.001) and SH (121 vs 181, p<0.001) periods, including significant decreases in abdominal pain (AC: 9 vs 22, EC: 10 vs 19, SH: 11 vs 18, p<0.001), chest pain (AC: 9 vs 15, EC: 8 vs 15, SH: 9 vs 15, p<0.01), headache (AC: 5 vs 11, EC: 4 vs 9, SH: 4 vs 9, p<0.01) and trauma (AC: 3 vs 5, EC: 2 vs 6, SH: 3 vs 5, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the combination of government-imposed restrictions and perceived risk of attending an ED during a pandemic may contribute to reduced attendances. Public confidence in EDs is necessary to reduce collateral damage caused by failure to seek medical attention during a pandemic; adequate infrastructure to allow social distancing and isolation capacity in EDs is a necessity.","Sless, Ryan Taylor; Hayward, Nathaniel Edward; Ryan, Paul MacDaragh; Deasy, Conor; Dasari, Kantikiran",Emerg Med J,24,29

Portanto, o estudo tem por objetivo determinar o perfil da expressão gênica de possíveis genes causadores da fibrose, conhecidos pelo o envolvimento em outros órgãos e espécies, no endométrio de éguas classificadas com diferentes graus de saúde uterina. Uma amostra de tecido endometrial foi colhida por meio de biopsia uterina e seccionada em dois fragmentos para posterior análise. Para os exames laboratoriais, a primeira amostra foi destinada à avaliação histopatológica e a segunda à validação de genes-alvo por reação polimerase em tempo real (qPCR). No exame histopatológico, o grau de fibrose e fase do ciclo estral foram estimados para distribuir as fêmeas nos grupos, além disso, o histórico reprodutivo foi analisado e a partir dos dados do exame histopatológico e histórico foram selecionadas 20 fêmeas para realização do qPCR (grupo I = 11; grupo II = 6; grupo III = 3). A segunda amostra de tecido foi armazenada em nitrogênio líquido imediatamente após a coleta, sendo posteriormente armazenada em freezer -80°C.

As a consequence, medical volunteers became a key human resource and young medical residents in any specialty were hired on a voluntary basis to contribute to take care of patients with COVID-19. This study reports on the lived experience of residents in child neuropsychiatry who volunteered in Italian hotspot COVID-19-designated hospitals during the epidemic outbreak. METHODS: A phenomenological, qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions was used to obtain in-depth narratives of the experience of residents in child neuropsychiatry volunteering in North Italy COVID-19-designated hospitals. All residents (n = 8) participated in the study. Interviews were conducted by an expert researcher trained in qualitative methods. Data analysis was performed by independent coders. RESULTS: Five core themes could be identified from the interviews: acting as mediators on two fronts, facing the shock of COVID-19 reality, capitalizing from specialty education, growing as persons and professionals, and humanizing medical care. CONCLUSIONS: This study is unique in providing an in-depth understanding of the experience of young residents in child neuropsychiatry volunteering in general hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Italy. The findings suggest that this experience may be highly beneficial for both the residents and the hospital quality of care. Insights for an accurate planning of residents' engagement in future healthcare emergencies are provided.","Parravicini, Stefano; Provenzi, Livio; Barello, Serena; Nania, Tiziana; Grumi, Serena; Rinaldi, Elisa; Orcesi, Simona; Borgatti, Renato",Acad. psychiatry,24,24

As of April 27, 2020, provinces and territories provided the Public Health Agency of Canada with detailed information on 24,079 cases, of which 3.9% (n=938) were younger than 20 years of age. The detection rate per 100,000 population was lower in this age group (11.9 per 100,000), compared with those aged 20-59 years (72.4 per 100,000) and 60 and older (113.6 per 100,000). The median age among those younger than 20 years of age was 13 years, and cases were distributed equally across male and female genders. Among provinces and territories with more than 100 cases, 1.6% to 9.8% of cases were younger than 20 years of age. Cases in this age group were more likely to be asymptomatic: 10.7% compared with 2.4% in those aged 20-59 years and 4.1% in those aged 60 and older. Children and youth experienced severe outcomes less often, but 2.2% (n=15/672) of cases within this age group were severe enough to require hospitalization. Based on available exposure information, 11.3% (n=59/520) of cases aged younger than 20 years had no known contact with a case.

This article proposes a decision-making approach for preferable medicine selection using picture fuzzy set (PFS), Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory of evidence and grey relational analysis (GRA). PFS is an extended version of the intuitionistic fuzzy set, where in addition to membership and non-membership grade, neutral and refusal membership grades are used to solve uncertain real-life problems more efficiently. Hence, we attempt to use it in this article to solve the mentioned problem. Previously, researchers considered the neutral membership grade of the PFS similar to the other two membership values (positive and negative) as applied to the decision-making method. In this study, we explore that neutral membership grade can be associated with probabilistic uncertainty which is measured using D-S theory of evidence and FUSH operation is applied for the aggregation purpose. Then GRA is used to measure the performance among the set of parameters which are in conflict and contradiction with each other. In this process, we propose an alternative group decision-making approach by the evidence of the neutral membership grade which is measured by the D-S theory and the conflict and contradiction among the criteria are managed by GRA. Finally, the proposed approach is demonstrated to solve the COVID-19 medicine selection problem.","Si, Amalendu; Das, Sujit; Kar, Samarjit",Soft comput,24,7

Our objective is to prevent and mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at an institutional level, while reducing the risk of infection among both physicians and patients in the context of a critical scenario in the local and Latin American healthcare system. METHODS: SAMeR Executive Committee set up a crisis committee which was made up of specialists in reproductive medicine, embryology, and healthcare management. A critical and updated review of the advances in science, documents, and recommendations released by other societies (ASRM, ESHRE, IFFS, Red LARA, societies of anesthesiologists, infectious diseases, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration-OSHA) was carried out. Likewise, there were joint meetings with the Ministry of Health of Argentina in order to draw up the guidelines. Simultaneously, ongoing medical training was carried out, thus providing added value to them, including two status surveys of the activities of the monovalent and polyvalent centers according to the country's epidemiological mapping. Four additional recommendations were made, and online training was given to healthcare workers. The aforementioned regulations were first analyzed by the healthcare providers and their practical suggestions were then added to the guidelines. RESULTS: The one-off collaborative work and the actions coordinated with the National ART Program of the Ministry of Health of Argentina resulted in the development and implementation of the present COVID-19 Risk Assessment and Safety Management Operational Guidelines at a national level. SAMeR gave recommendations for the implementation of the Management Guidelines for the center reopening, providing new safety criteria against the threat of viral contagion. A new organizational culture was promoted through the awareness of all the healthcare workers and teaching responsibility. We continue working on the compliance with a new ""Code of Conduct and Commitment in Healthcare"" and with workplace safety measures. We helped with transforming the theoretical knowledge into practical measures for the healthcare workers in different services, with the aim to prevent, mitigate, and/or handle contingencies at the centers/services and gamete banks, in line with the actions agreed upon with the Ministry of Health. CONCLUSIONS: As an extraordinary and uncertain event, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic helped consolidate a volunteer-based and collaborative panel of SAMeR experts who developed the COVID-19 Risk Assessment and Safety Management Operational Guidelines as a new and readily available tool for physicians, patients, and gamete banks care. Their implementation has provided specific guidelines to minimize risk for professionals in ART clinics, as well as guaranteeing patient safety.","Alaluf, Maria Graciela; Pasqualini, Agustin; Fiszbajn, Gabriel; Botti, Gustavo; Estofan, Gustavo; Ruhlmann, Claudio; Solari, Leticia; Bisioli, Claudio; Pene, Alicia; Branzini, Constanza; Quintero Retamar, Andrea; Checkherdemian, Valeria; Pesce, Romina; Serpa, Idelma; Lorenzo, Fabian; Avendaño, Conrado; Alvarez Sedo, Cristian; Lancuba, Stella",J Assist Reprod Genet,24,24

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Two cities in China--Wuhan (epicentre) and Chongqing (a less affected city). POPULATION: A total of 1947 pregnant women. METHODS: We collected demographic, pregnancy and epidemic information from our pregnant subjects, along with their attitudes towards COVID-19 (using a self-constructed five-point scale). The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was used to assess anxiety status. Obstetric decision-making was also evaluated. The differences between cities in all of the above factors were compared and the factors that influenced anxiety levels were identified by multivariable analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anxiety status and its influencing factors. Obstetric decision-making. RESULTS: Differences were observed between cities in some background characteristics and women's attitudes towards COVID-19 in Wuhan were more extreme. More women in Wuhan felt anxious (24.5 versus 10.4%). Factors that influenced anxiety also included household income, subjective symptom and attitudes. Overall, obstetric decisions also revealed city-based differences; these decisions mainly concerned hospital preference, time of prenatal care or delivery, mode of delivery and infant feeding. CONCLUSIONS: The outbreak aggravated prenatal anxiety and the associated factors could be targets for psychological care. In parallel, key obstetric decision-making changed, emphasising the need for pertinent professional advice. Special support is essential for pregnant mothers during epidemics.

The COVID-19 outbreak is unique in its rapid transmission and results in heavy stress for the front-line health care workers (HCWs). The current study aimed to exam posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs) of HCWs fighting for the COVID-19 and to evaluate their sleep quality after 1-month stressful suffering. Three hundred seventy-seven HCWs working in different provinces of China participated in the survey between February 1 and 5. The demographic information was collected first. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were selected to measure PTSSs and sleep quality. Results showed that 1 month after the outbreak, the prevalence of PTSSs was 3.8% in HCWs. Female HCWs were more vulnerable to PTSSs with hazard ratio of 2.136 (95% CI = 1.388-3.286). HCWs with higher exposure level also significantly rated more hyperarousal symptoms (hazard ratio = 4.026, 95% CI = 1.233-13.140). There was a significant difference of sleep quality between participants with and without PTSSs (z value = 6.014, p < .001) and among different groups with various contact frequencies (chi-square = 7.307, p = .026). Path analysis showed that there was a significant indirect effect from exposure level to PTSSs through sleep quality (coefficient = 1.750, 95% CI of Boostroop test = 0.543-2.998). In summary, targeted interventions on sleep contribute to the mental recovery during the outbreak of COVID-19. Understanding the mental health response after a public health emergency might help HCWs and communities prepare for a population's response to disaster.","Yin, Qianlan; Sun, Zhuoer; Liu, Tuanjie; Ni, Xiong; Deng, Xuanfeng; Jia, Yanpu; Shang, Zhilei; Zhou, Yaoguang; Liu, Weizhi",Clin Psychol Psychother,24,10

This study describes patient experiences with telemedicine for contraceptive counseling during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. STUDY DESIGN: This is a mixed-methods study which includes a web-based or phone survey and in-depth phone interviews with patients who had telemedicine visits for contraception. RESULTS: A total of 169 patients had eligible telemedicine visits between April 1 and June 30, 2020. Of these, 86 (51%) responded to the survey, and 23 (14%) participated in the interviews. We found that 86% of survey respondents were very satisfied with the telemedicine visit, and 63% said it completely met their needs. A majority (73%) strongly agreed that these visits should be maintained after the COVID-19 pandemic, and half (51%) would be very likely to choose them over in-person visits. In-depth interviews highlighted the convenience of telemedicine, especially for those with work or parenting responsibilities. Although some patients had in-person visits after telehealth, many appreciated the counseling they received remotely, and found the subsequent in-person visits more efficient. Patients identified visits that do not require physical exams as ideal visits for telehealth, and some hoped that all or most of their future visits would be telehealth visits. Many patients (43%) expressed a preference for phone over video visits. CONCLUSIONS: Patients reported an overall positive experience with telemedicine visits for contraceptive counseling during the COVID-19 pandemic. They appreciated the convenience of telemedicine visits and valued the virtual counseling experience. IMPLICATIONS: Health care providers who initiated or expanded telemedicine services for contraceptive counseling during the COVID-19 pandemic should consider continuing to offer them after the pandemic. At the policy level, these findings favor expanding access to telemedicine and providing reimbursement for virtual visits, including telephone visits.","Stifani, Bianca M; Smith, Abigail; Avila, Karina; Boos, Elise W; Ng, June; Levi, Erika E; Benfield, Nerys C",Contraception,24,16

The rapid growth of the disease has led to overwhelmed health-care systems, overcrowded hospitals, an insufficient number of health-care professionals and shortages of medical equipment. The potential exposure of front-line health-care workers during the COVID-19 outbreak has led to self-isolation and the appearance of adverse feelings such as stress, anxiety and fear. All these factors, combined with an increased workload and extra and changed shifts, are determinants of a sleep-loss process that may result in insomnia. The exacerbated pro-inflammatory milieu caused by insomnia and sleep deprivation present in health professionals may therefore make them more prone to developing severe COVID-19 if infected and/or aggravate the symptoms of the disease. Keeping these professionals healthy and doing everything possible to prevent them from being infected with COVID-19 should be a top priority. As part of this effort, we must be aware of the important effects of insomnia on the immune systems of these professionals and take all possible measures to counter these effects.","Ishikura, Isabela A; Rosa, Daniela S; Hachul, Helena; Pires, Gabriel N; Tufik, Sergio; Andersen, Monica L",Scand J Public Health,24,20

Considering the repercussion of these unique social experiences in infant's health, this study aims to assess the early impact of social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic in hospital admissions for acute bronchiolitis. METHODS: Data from hospitalizations of acute bronchiolitis in infants under one year were obtained from the Department of Informatics of the Brazilian Public Health database (DATASUS) for the period between 2016 and 2020. These data were also analyzed by macro-regions of Brazil (North, Northeast, Southeast, South and Midwest). To evaluate the effect of social distancing strategy on the incidence of acute bronchiolitis, the absolute and relative reduction was calculated by analyzing the yearly subsets of 2016vs2020, 2017vs2020, 2018vs2020, and 2019vs2020. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in all comparisons, ranging from -78% [IRR 0.22 (0.20 to 0.24)] in 2016vs2020 at -85% [IRR 0.15 (0.13 to 0.16)] in 2019vs2020, for the data from Brazil. For analyzes by macro-regions, the reduction varied from -58% [IRR 0.41 (0.37 to 0.45)] in the Midwest in 2016vs2020 to -93% [IRR 0.07 (0.06 to 0.08)] in the South in 2019vs2020. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant reduction in hospitalization for acute bronchiolitis in children under one year old, in Brazil, of the order of more than 70% for most analysis. Our data suggest an important impact of social distance on reducing the transmission of viruses related to acute bronchiolitis. Such knowledge may guide strategies for prevention of viruses spread.","Friedrich, Frederico; Ongaratto, Renata; Scotta, Marcelo C; Veras, Tiago N; Stein, Renato; Lumertz, Magali Santos; Jones, Marcus Herbert; Comaru, Talitha; Pinto, Leonardo Araújo",Clin. infect. dis,24,4

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case series with a control group evaluating the effectiveness and safety of CPT in patients with COVID-19 are included for the meta-analyses. Our search retrieved seven studies, including two RCTs and five cohort studies, with a total of 5444 patients.

Some recovered patients complain of continued shortness of breath. Vasculopathy has been reported in COVID-19, stressing the importance of probing microstructure and function of lungs at the alveolar-capillary interface.

Using 129Xe MRI, we found COVID-19 patients have higher ventilation defects percentage (5.9% vs 3.7%), unchanged microstructure, longer gas-blood exchange time (43.5 ms vs 32.5 ms), and reduced RBC/TP (0.279 vs 0.330) compared with healthy subjects. These findings suggest regional ventilation and alveolar airspace dimensions are relatively normal around the time of discharge, while gas-blood exchange function is diminished.

As new complications associated with the virus become more apparent, concerns in the medical community continue to grow. One of the more commonly encountered and more troubling complications in critically ill patients has been hypercoagulable state and subsequent thrombotic events. Within the spectrum of observed thrombotic events, pulmonary embolism seems to prevail. These trends are concerning and reinforce current recommendations on anticoagulation in critically ill with the virus. To illustrate the variety of possible presentations of pulmonary emboli in COVID-19 population, two cases of patients in their sixties are described, one without any predisposing risk factors and one with history of asthma and obesity. These patients developed pulmonary emboli at different points during their hospital course, were treated differently, and had different outcomes. Important observations are made that may shed some light on possible etiology of pulmonary emboli. One of the patients presented still developed pulmonary embolism despite being on full dose anticoagulation. Literature review suggests that pulmonary clot burden in COVID-19 patients could be due to pulmonary thrombus rather than pulmonary embolism and is triggered by profuse vascular damage and severe inflammatory response. Literature review also proposes changes to the diagnostic work up in COVID-19 patients, such as earlier screening for pulmonary embolism in critically ill.

Those factors' relevance and their impact on sexual function in this population have not yet been established. AIM: To evaluate the impact of the pandemic on sexual function in healthcare professionals and medical students at a reference center in the treatment of COVID-19 in Brazil. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis with online questionnaires about sexual function was sent to health professionals and medical students from the HC-FMUSP medical complex. The questionnaire evaluated Total Sexual and Masturbatory Frequency prior and during the pandemic, libido and sexual satisfaction changes with a detailed inquire about demographics and personal factors. An objective assessment of sexual function was also made using the validated sexual quotient questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in intercourse frequency, libido, and overall sexual satisfaction, in a sample of healthcare professionals particularly vulnerable to the pandemic effects. RESULTS: A total of 1,314 responses were available with a mean age of 37 years. Worsening of sexual satisfaction was reported by 44.5% of the participants, with the following associated factors: Lower libido, missing Nightlife, Higher Masturbatory Frequency, and isolation from the partner. Remaning sexualy actively and having higher sexual frequency appear to decrease the chance of worsening sexual function. Worsening of Libido was reported by 37% and had several associated factors, including missing of Nightlife, older age, isolation from the partner among others. Being male and sexually active was associated with a smaller chance of reporting lower libido. CONCLUSION: We were able to observe a sharp drop in Libido and General Sexual Satisfaction. Although an increase in pornography consumption and masturbatory frequency did occur, these factors were not associated with greater sexual satisfaction. The impact of COVID-19 on this population's sexual health is not to be underestimated and should be further studied in the follow-up of the pandemic.

During pregnancy, disruptions in homeostasis may increase the likelihood of preterm birth and preeclampsia. Expectant mothers traditionally have high rates of anxiety and depressive disorders, and many are susceptible to a variety of stressors during pregnancy. These common life stressors include financial concerns and relationship challenges and may be exacerbated by the biological, social, and psychological changes occurring during pregnancy. In addition, external stressors such as major weather events (eg, hurricanes, tornados, floods) and other global phenomena (eg, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic) may contribute to stress during pregnancy. This review investigates recent literature published about the use of nonpharmacologic modalities for stress relief in pregnancy and examines the interplay between psychiatric diagnoses and stressors, with the purpose of evaluating the feasibility of implementing nonpharmacologic interventions as sole therapies or in conjunction with psychotherapy or psychiatric medication therapy. Further, the effectiveness of each nonpharmacologic therapy in reducing symptoms of maternal stress is reviewed. Mindfulness meditation and biofeedback have shown effectiveness in improving one's mental health, such as depressive symptoms and anxiety. Exercise, including yoga, may improve both depressive symptoms and birth outcomes. Expressive writing has successfully been applied postpartum and in response to pregnancy challenges. Although some of these nonpharmacologic interventions can be convenient and low cost, there is a trend toward inconsistent implementation of these modalities. Future investigations should focus on methods to increase ease of uptake, ensure each option is available at home, and provide a standardized way to evaluate whether combinations of different interventions may provide added benefit.","Traylor, Claire S; Johnson, Jasmine D; Kimmel, Mary C; Manuck, Tracy A",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,24,22

BACKGROUND: AAs have worse outcomes compared to whites while facing heart diseases, stroke, cancer, asthma, influenza and pneumonia, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS. However, there is no current study to show the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the AA communities. METHODS: This is a retrospective study that included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 2 tertiary centers in New Orleans, LA. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 157 patients were identified. Of these, 134 (77%) were AAs, whereas 23.4% of patients were Whites. Interestingly, AA were younger, with a mean age of 63 ± 13.4 compared to 75.7 ± 23 years in Whites (P < 0.001). Thirty-seven patients presented with no insurance, and 34 of them were AA. SOFA Score was significantly higher in AA (2.57 ± 2.1) compared to White patients (1.69 ± 1.7), P = 0.041. Elevated SOFA score was associated with higher odds for intubation (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.32-1.93, P < 0.001).

METHODS: We systematically searched Medline and Scopus to identify all observational cohort studies published before January 2020 that compared outcome (short-term mortality) in patients with AAD with high vs low levels of baseline NT-proBNP combining terms ""brain natriuretic peptide"" and ""aortic dissection."" A meta-analysis was conducted using the generic inverse variance method. Heterogeneity between studies was investigated using the Cochrane's Q test and I2 statistic. RESULTS: Four studies were included in final analysis including a total of 950 patients, and 105 (11%) patients died. Baseline NT-proBNP concentrations were significantly higher in nonsurvivors (median 2240 pg/mL, range 1678-16 347 pg/mL) when compared to survivors (665 pg/mL, 328-1252 pg/mL).

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the organizational and social commitments and related factors during the coronavirus pandemic of healthcare workers in northern Iran. METHODS: This descriptive-analytical study was conducted in 2020 among 260 healthcare workers of Babol health centers by a stratified-random sampling method. Data were collected according to a valid and reliable questionnaire consisting of three parts: 8 questions about personal and job characteristics, 15 questions from Porter Organizational Commitment Questionnaire (OCQ), 15 questions from Carroll's social responsibility. Each question was scored on the Likert scale of organizational and social commitment questionnaires. Data were analyzed by chi-square and logistic regression. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: None of the healthcare workers belonged to the category of low organizational commitments. A portion of 27.7% of the healthcare workers had moderate organizational commitments and 72.3% had high organizational commitments. A portion of 9.2% of the healthcare workers had moderate social commitments and 90.8% had high social commitments. Chi-square showed that education (p = 0.001), job position (p = 0.001) and the area in which healthcare workers were present for service (p = 0.002) were significantly associated with organizational commitments. According to OR in the logistic regression model, healthcare workers with master's and doctoral education levels had 3.482 times more social commitments than others and the health group had 2.455 times more social commitments compared to the treatment group. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that at the time of the coronavirus outbreak, the healthcare workers in Babol had very positive and high organizational and social commitments. As the world struggles with the coronavirus pandemic, employee and organizational productivity may decline due to the fear and anxiety of healthcare workers in various organizations. It is expected that managers of health-related organizations, social, economic, and cultural organizations use the results of this study to identify factors affecting the organizational and social commitments of employees and strengthen them.","Aghalari, Zahra; Dahms, Hans-Uwe; Jafarian, Somayeh; Gholinia, Hemmat",Global Health,24,23

As a muscle enriched microRNA that has been implicated in muscle biogenesis, the role of miR-133b in DMD remains unknown. To assess miR-133b function in DMD-affected skeletal muscles, we genetically ablated miR-133b in the mdx mouse model of DMD. We show that deletion of miR-133b exacerbates the dystrophic phenotype of DMD-afflicted skeletal muscle by dysregulating muscle stem cells involved in muscle biogenesis, in addition to impacting signalling pathways related to inflammation and fibrosis. Our results provide evidence that miR-133b may underlie DMD pathology by affecting the proliferation and differentiation of muscle stem cells. ABSTRACT: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by progressive skeletal muscle degeneration. No treatments are currently available to prevent the disease. While the muscle enriched microRNA, miR-133b, has been implicated in muscle biogenesis, its role in DMD remains unknown. To assess miR-133b function in DMD-affected skeletal muscles, we genetically ablated miR-133b in the mdx mouse model of DMD. In the absence of miR-133b, the tibialis anterior muscle of P30 mdx mice is smaller in size and exhibits a thickened interstitial space containing more mononucleated cells. Additional analysis revealed that miR-133b deletion influences muscle fibre regeneration, satellite cell proliferation and differentiation, and induces widespread transcriptomic changes in mdx muscle. These include known miR-133b targets as well as genes involved in cell proliferation and fibrosis. Altogether, our data demonstrate that skeletal muscles utilize miR-133b to mitigate the deleterious effects of DMD. This article is protected by copyright.

Although these statistical potentials are not to be confused with their physics-based counterparts of the same name-i.e. PMFs obtained by molecular dynamics simulations-their particular success in assessing the native-like character of protein structure predictions has lead authors to consider the computed scores as approximations of the free energy. However, this physical justification is a matter of controversy since the beginning. Alternative interpretations based on Bayes' theorem have been proposed, but the misleading formalism that invokes the inverse Boltzmann law remains recurrent in the literature. In this article, we present a conceptually new method for ranking protein structure models by quality, which is (i) independent of any physics-based explanation and (ii) relevant to statistics and to a general definition of information gain. The theoretical development described in this study provides new insights into how statistical PMFs work, in comparison with our approach. To prove the concept, we have built interatomic distance-dependent scoring functions, based on the former and new equations, and compared their performance on an independent benchmark of 60,000 protein structures. The results demonstrate that our new formalism outperforms statistical PMFs in evaluating the quality of protein structural decoys. Therefore, this original type of score offers a possibility to improve the success of statistical PMFs in the various fields of structural biology where they are applied.

These value types are linked to three consumer behavior outcomes, i.e., Satisfaction, Repurchase intention, and Word-of-Mouth. The impact of the retail formats is evaluated on the importance and performance of the value types, using a questionnaire for each of the retail formats. The relationship between the value types and outcomes is tested with partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Aesthetics, Altruistic value, and Efficiency are positively linked to Satisfaction. In addition, Efficiency is the key driver for Repurchase intention and has a positive impact on Word-of-Mouth. A positive Word-of-Mouth is predicted by Social value and Service excellence. The three examined retail formats show a difference in Holbrook's value types. Overall, the results of the non- and soft discounters differ from the hard discounters. Remarkably, and contrary to previous studies, the soft discounter's scores are the highest meaning that consumers are most critical for this retail format. It seems that consumers expect the best of both worlds at soft discounters: low prices, interesting bargains, easy access, but also appealing store design, and excellent service.","Janssens, Kim; Lambrechts, Wim; Keur, Henriëtte; Semeijn, Janjaap",,24,25

OBJECTIVE: Given the high prevalence of asthma in the New York City area, our objective was to determine whether underlying asthma was associated with poor outcomes among hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 compared with patients without asthma. METHODS: Electronic heath records were reviewed for 1298 sequential patients 65 years or younger without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who were admitted to our hospital system with a confirmed positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test result. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of asthma among all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was 12.6%, yet a higher prevalence (23.6%) was observed in the subset of 55 patients younger than 21 years. There was no significant difference in hospital length of stay, need for intubation, length of intubation, tracheostomy tube placement, hospital readmission, or mortality between patients with and without asthma. Observations between patients with and without asthma were similar when stratified by obesity, other comorbid conditions (ie, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes), use of controller asthma medication, and absolute eosinophil count. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized patients 65 years or younger with severe COVID-19, asthma diagnosis was not associated with worse outcomes, regardless of age, obesity, or other high-risk comorbidities. Future population-based studies are needed to investigate the risk of developing COVID-19 among patients with asthma once universal testing becomes readily available.","Lovinsky-Desir, Stephanie; Deshpande, Deepti R; De, Aliva; Murray, Laurie; Stingone, Jeanette A; Chan, Angela; Patel, Neha; Rai, Nooralam; DiMango, Emily; Milner, Joshua; Kattan, Meyer",J Allergy Clin Immunol,24,1

In addition to being a target of the virus, the kidney also seems to have substantial influence on the outcomes of the disease. <p> Methods: Data was obtained by a comprehensive and non-systematic search in the PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus and SciELO databases, using mainly the terms ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"", ""chronic kidney disease"", ""renal transplantation"", acute kidney injury"" and ""renal dysfunction"". <p> Discussion: The membrane-bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and this interaction may lead to an imbalance of the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS), associated with worse clinical presentations of COVID-19, including acute pulmonary injury, hyperinflammatory state and hematological alterations. In the framework of renal diseases, development of acute kidney injury is associated mostly with immune alterations and direct cytopathic lesions by the virus, leading to higher mortality. As for chronic kidney disease, the patients at a non-terminal stage have worse prog-nosis, while the hemodialysis patients appear to have mild courses of COVID-19, probably due to lower chances of being affected by the cytokine storm. Furthermore, the current scenario is unfavorable to kidney donation and transplantation. The relationship between COVID-19 and immunosuppression in kidney transplantation recipients has been greatly discussed to determine whether it increases mortality and how it interacts with immunosuppressive medications. <p> Conclusion: The kidney and the RAS exert fundamental roles in the SARS-CoV-2 infection and more research is required to have a complete understanding on the repercussions caused by COVID-19 in renal diseases.","Cota, Letícia Bitencourt; Pedrosa, Ana Luisa; de Brito, Stephanie Bruna Camilo Soares; Fróes, Ana Cláudia Fontoura; de Carvalho, Sarah Tayná; Fonseca, Giulio Gori; Ferreira, Guilherme Costa; Fradico, Pollyanna Faria; Simões E Silva, Ana Cristina",,24,1

METHODS: Prospective, multicentre study on adult patients with microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 receiving mechanical ventilation. All included participants underwent screening protocol for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis with bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan and cultures performed on admission at 7 days and in case of clinical deterioration. Cases were classified as coronavirus associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) according to previous consensus definitions. The new definition was compared with putative invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (PIPA). RESULTS: A total of 108 patients were enrolled. Probable CAPA was diagnosed in 30 (27.7%) of patients after a median of 4 (2-8) days from intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significant higher 30-day mortality rate from ICU admission among patients with either CAPA (44% vs 19%, p= 0.002) or PIPA (74% vs 26%, p<0.001) when compared with patients not fulfilling criteria for aspergillosis.

Among patients with CAPA receiving voriconazole treatment (13 patients, 43%) A trend toward lower mortality (46% vs 59% p=0.30) and reduction of galactomannan index in consecutive samples was observed. CONCLUSION: We found a high incidence of CAPA among critically ill COVID-19 patients and that its occurrence seems to change the natural history of disease.","Bartoletti, Michele; Pascale, Renato; Cricca, Monica; Rinaldi, Matteo; Maccaro, Angelo; Bussini, Linda; Fornaro, Giacomo; Tonetti, Tommaso; Pizzilli, Giacinto; Francalanci, Eugenia; Giuntoli, Lorenzo; Rubin, Arianna; Moroni, Alessandra; Ambretti, Simone; Trapani, Filippo; Vatamanu, Oana; Ranieri, Vito Marco; Castelli, Andrea; Baiocchi, Massimo; Lewis, Russell; Giannella, Maddalena; Viale, Pierluigi",Clin. infect. dis,24,24

An incomplete understanding of immune correlates of protection represents a major barrier to the design of vaccines and therapeutic approaches to prevent infection or limit disease. This deficit is largely due to the lack of prospectively collected, pre-infection samples from individuals that go on to become infected with SARS-CoV-2. Here, we utilized data from genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) mice infected with SARS-CoV to determine whether baseline T cell signatures are associated with a lack of viral control and severe disease upon infection. SARS-CoV infection of CC mice results in a variety of viral load trajectories and disease outcomes. Overall, a dysregulated, pro-inflammatory signature of circulating T cells at baseline was associated with severe disease upon infection. Our study serves as proof of concept that circulating T cell signatures at baseline can predict clinical and virologic outcomes upon SARS-CoV infection. Identification of basal immune predictors in humans could allow for identification of individuals at highest risk of severe clinical and virologic outcomes upon infection, who may thus most benefit from available clinical interventions to restrict infection and disease.","Graham, Jessica B; Swarts, Jessica L; Leist, Sarah R; Schäfer, Alexandra; Menachery, Vineet D; Gralinski, Lisa E; Jeng, Sophia; Miller, Darla R; Mooney, Michael A; McWeeney, Shannon K; Ferris, Martin T; Pardo-Manuel de Villena, Fernando; Heise, Mark T; Baric, Ralph S; Lund, Jennifer M",PLoS Pathog,24,16

The mechanism consist on the existence of vulnerable proteins (VPs), which are (i) mainly expressed outside the lungs; (ii) their perturbations is known to produce human diseases; and (iii) can be perturbed directly or indirectly by SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These VPs are perturbed by other proteins, which are: (i) mainly expressed in the lungs, (ii) are targeted directly by SARS-CoV-2 proteins, (iii) can navigate outside the lungs as cargo of extracellular vesicles (EVs); and (iv) can activate VPs via subdiffusive processes inside the target organ. Using bioinformatic tools and mathematical modeling we identifies 26 VPs and their 38 perturbators, which predict extracellular damages in the immunologic endocrine, cardiovascular, circulatory, lymphatic, musculoskeletal, neurologic, dermatologic, hepatic, gastrointestinal, and metabolic systems, as well as in the eyes. The identification of these VPs and their perturbators allow us to identify 27 existing drugs which are candidates to be repurposed for treating extrapulmonary damage in severe COVID-19 patients. After removal of drugs having undesirable drug-drug interactions we select 7 drugs and one natural product: apabetalone, romidepsin, silmitasertib, ozanezumab, procaine, azacitidine, amlexanox, volociximab, and ellagic acid, whose combinations can palliate the organs and systems found to be damaged by COVID-19. We found that at least 4 drugs are needed to treat all the multiorgan damages, for instance: the combination of romidepsin, silmitasertib, apabetalone and azacitidine.","Estrada, Ernesto",Med Drug Discov,24,16

METHODS: We investigate the intra-household transmission of COVID-19 through the secondary-attack rate (SAR) and household reproduction number (Rh). We estimate these using (i) data from 29 prior studies (February-August 2020), (ii) epidemiologically linked confirmed cases from Singapore (January-April 2020) and (iii) widespread-testing data from Vo' (February-March 2020). For (i), we use a Bayesian random-effects model that corrects for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test sensitivity and asymptomatic cases. We investigate the robustness of Rh with respect to community transmission rates and mobility patterns. RESULTS: The corrected pooled estimates from prior studies for SAR and Rh are 24% (20-28%) and 0.34 (0.30-0.38), respectively. Without corrections, the pooled estimates are: SAR = 18% (14-21%) and Rh = 0.28 (0.25-0.32). The corrected estimates line up with direct estimates from contact-tracing data from Singapore [Rh = 0.32 (0.22-0.42)] and population testing data from Vo' [SAR = 31% (28-34%) and Rh = 0.37 (0.34-0.40)]. The analysis of Singapore data further suggests that the value of Rh (0.22-0.42) is robust to community-spread dynamics; our estimate of Rh stays constant whereas the fraction of infections attributable to household transmission (Rh/Reff) is lowest during outbreaks (5-7%) and highest during lockdowns and periods of low community spread (25-30%). CONCLUSIONS: The three data-source types yield broadly consistent estimates for SAR and Rh. Our study suggests that household infections are responsible for a large fraction of infections and so household transmission may be an effective target for intervention.","Curmei, Mihaela; Ilyas, Andrew; Evans, Owain; Steinhardt, Jacob",Int. j. epidemiol,24,16

However, outliers in this theoretical disposition make empirical proof of the fuel subsidy-carbon intensity apt and primitive. Despite established fuel subsidy abolishment gains for climate and economic welfare, the relevance, magnitude and policy implications remain dimly. This paper employs the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) estimation procedure to gauge the contemporaneous influence of fuel subsidy for carbon intensity in Nigeria. Findings revealed that fuel subsidy removal inversely relates to Nigeria's carbon emission in the short run and long run. The study recommends a complementary policy option that ensures additional financial savings to the government should be invested in public sector growth that can cushion the effect of relative income loss to the citizenry. The Nigerian government should ensure measures are kept in place to discourage overconsumption of alternative energy (for example coal) that could also threaten the green economy paradox.","Adekunle, Ibrahim Ayoade; Oseni, Isiaq Olasunkanmi",,24,29

A multiplicity of factors contributes to children's experience of violence. Social and gender norms can act as risk and protective factors exposing children to violence or preventing them from having well-being and healthy development. This Special Symposium was conceived of during the first International Viable and Operable Ideas for Child Equality (VOICE) Conference in 2018 in Bali, Indonesia. The four manuscripts in this Special Symposium illustrate with evidence the importance of social norms to preventing violence against children and the importance of understanding norms in context. The authors find that understanding how geographic location, social cohesion, group roles and identities, age and gendered expectations inform whether, when and which children experience violence, who perpetrates it, and how individuals and communities respond to it. The global COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated how rapidly behaviours can shift towards caregiving and health, as well as against it. If we are to prevent violence against children, and ensure the safety, well-being, and opportunity to thrive for all children, advancing our understanding of norms in relation to violence against children is critical to effective programming and learning.","Kohli, Anjalee; Agastya, Ni Luh Putu Maitra; Cislaghi, Ben; Schulte, Marie-Celine",Glob Public Health,24,5

A Large-scale satellite data was combined with these data with a regression analysis model to explore effects of temperature and relative humidity on COVID-19 spreading, as well as the possible transmission risk by seasonal cycles. The result show that temperature and relative humidity are negatively correlated with COVID-19 transmission throughout the world. Government intervention (e.g. lockdown policies) and lower population movement contributed to the decrease the new daily case ratio. Weather conditions are not the decisive factor in COVID-19 transmission, in that government intervention as well as public awareness, could contribute to the mitigation of the spreading of the virus. So, it deserves a dynamic government policy to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in winter.","Zhang, Chen; Liao, Hua; Strobl, Eric; Li, Hui; Li, Ru; Jensen, Steen Solvang; Zhang, Ying",J Clean Prod,24,30

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect sex-related hormones and testicular function in recovering patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients were separately classified according to the duration of viral shedding (long-term positive vs normal-term group, with the former cases having a duration > 50 days) and disease severity (moderate vs severe group). Differences in sex-related hormone levels were compared between groups and linear regression analysis was used to compare the associations of testosterone (T) and estradiol with various clinical and laboratory factors. RESULTS: A total of 39 COVID-19-infected patients were included in this study. The mean T level was in the normal reference range while the mean estradiol level was above the normal limit. There were no significant differences between the long-term positive and normal-term groups in T (P = .964), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH; P = .694), luteinizing hormone (LH; P = .171), prolactin (PRL; P = .836), or T/LH (P = .512). However, estradiol was higher in the normal-term group than the long-term positive group (P < .001). Moreover, there were also no significant differences between the moderate and severe groups in sex-related hormones, duration of viral shedding, or serum biochemical or inflammation indicators. Additionally, regression analyses showed that there were no associations between the T level and the clinical and laboratory factors, while estradiol was negatively associated with the duration of viral shedding. CONCLUSION: In males infected with SARS-CoV-2, most sex-related hormones (T, FSH and LH levels) remain within the normal reference ranges after recovery from COVID-19, and no significant associations were observed between T level and disease duration or severity. At present, there is insufficient evidence to show that SARS-CoV-2 causes hypogonadism and sterility, but the potential risk should not be ignored.","Xu, Hui; Wang, Zhixian; Feng, Chunxiang; Yu, Weiwei; Chen, Yuan; Zeng, Xiaoyong; Liu, Chang",Androl.

According to WHO, thus far (23 November 2020) 58,425,681 infected cases including 1,385,218 deaths have been reported worldwide. In order to reduce transmission and spread of this lethal virus, attempts are globally being made to develop an appropriate vaccine. Intending to neutralize pathogens at their initial entrance site, protective mucosal immunity is inevitably required. In SARS-CoV2 infection and transmission, respiratory mucosa plays a key role; hence, apparently mucosal vaccination could be a superior approach to elicit mucosal and systemic immune responses simultaneously. In this review, the advantages of mucosal vaccination to control COVID-19 infection, limitations, and outcomes of mucosal vaccines have been highlighted. Considering the gut microbiota dysregulation in COVID-19, we further provide evidences on utilization of recombinant probiotics, particularly lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as vaccine carrier. Their intrinsic immunomodulatory features, natural adjuvanticity, and feasible expression of relevant antigen in the mucosal surface make them more appealing as live cell factory. Among all available platforms, bioengineered probiotics are considered as the most affordable, most practical, and safest vaccination approach to halt this emerging virus.","Moradi-Kalbolandi, Shima; Majidzadeh-A, Keyvan; Abdolvahab, Mohadeseh Haji; Jalili, Neda; Farahmand, Leila",Probiot. antimicrob. proteins (Internet),24,29

For example, in polluted habitats, melanin can have a detoxifying function. Melanic coloration would help to sequester in the skin the heavy metals contaminants from inside the body, which will be expulsed to the exterior when the skin is sloughed. Moreover, animals should have evolved more melanic colorations in more polluted habitats (""industrial melanism"" hypothesis). We examined whether the fossorial amphisbaenian reptile, Trogonophis wiegmanni, is able to eliminate heavy metals, derived from soil pollution by seagulls depositions, through sloughing its skin. Our results suggest a covariation between levels of soil pollution by heavy metals and the concentration of heavy metals in the sloughed skins of amphisbaenians. This suggests that amphisbaenians may expel heavy metals from their bodies when they slough the skins. We also tested whether amphisbaenians inhabiting soils with higher levels of heavy metal pollution had darker (melanin-dependent) body colorations. However, contrary to predictions from the ""industrial melanization"" hypothesis, we found a negative relationship between soil pollution and proportions of melanic coloration. This contradictory result could, however, be explained because heavy metals have endocrine disruption effects that increase physiological stress, and higher stress levels could result in decreased melanogenesis. We suggest that although amphisbaenians might have some detoxifying mechanism linked to melanin in the skin, this process might be negatively affected by stress and result ineffective under conditions of high soil pollution.

This work extends the results presented in Sun et. al (2020) [1] for the first six months of the third observing run (O3A). The complex-valued, frequency-dependent, and slowly time-varying systematic error (excursion from unity magnitude and zero phase) in O3B generally remains at a consistent level as in O3A, yet changes of detector configurations in O3B have introduced a non-negligible change in the frequency dependence of the error, leading to larger excursions from unity at some frequencies and/or during some observational periods; in some other periods the excursions are smaller than those in O3A. For O3B, the upper limit on the systematic error and associated uncertainty is 11.29% in magnitude and 9.18 deg in phase (68% confidence interval) in the most sensitive frequency band 20-2000 Hz. The systematic error alone is estimated at levels of<2% in magnitude and $\lesssim 4$ deg in phase.

Disruption of epithelial and endothelial barriers is a key clinical turning point that differentiates patients who are likely to develop severe COVID-19 outcomes: it marks a significant escalation in respiratory symptoms, loss of viral containment and a progression toward multi-organ dysfunction. These barrier mechanisms are independently compromised by known COVID-19 risk factors, including diabetes, obesity and aging: thus, a synergism between these underlying conditions and SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms may explain why these risk factors correlate with more severe outcomes. This review examines the key cellular mechanisms that SARS-CoV-2 and its underlying risk factors utilize to disrupt barrier function. As an outlook, we propose that glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) may be a therapeutic intervention that can slow COVID-19 progression and improve clinical outcome following SARS-CoV-2 infection. GLP-1 signaling activates barrier-promoting processes that directly oppose the pro-inflammatory mechanisms commandeered by SARS-CoV-2 and its underlying risk factors.","Hanchard, Julia; Capó-Vélez, Coral M; Deusch, Kai; Lidington, Darcy; Bolz, Steffen-Sebastian",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),24,20

Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery is one of the most engaged disciplines, and otolaryngology specialists are facing a radical change of their role and daily activities that will have severe impact on the return to the ordinary. In this paper, the COVID-19 Task Force of the Young Otolaryngologists of the Italian Society of Otolaryngology comment on the changes that occurred for otolaryngology in Italy during the pandemic. Changes include organizational rearrangement of Otolaryngology Units, with merges and closures that affected a significant portion of them; reallocation of otolaryngology personnel, mainly to COVID-19 wards; reduction of elective clinical and surgical activity, that was mainly limited to oncology and emergency procedures; and execution of screening procedures for SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare providers and patients in otolaryngology units in Italy.","Ralli, M; Mannelli, G; Bonali, M; Capasso, P; Guarino, P; Iannini, V; Mevio, N; Russo, G; Scarpa, A; Spinato, G; Topazio, D; Molteni, G",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,24,16

Most severely ill adult patients develop a coagulopathy that was not described until recently, and which is currently considered a main cause of death. Everything indicates that a similar phenomenon also occurs in children with COVID-19. Anticoagulant treatment has become one of the therapeutic foundations for this infection; however, its implementation in children can be difficult since, until recently, it was not considered in the pediatric population. Evidence regarding the use of anticoagulants in COVID-19 is rapidly generated, changes constantly, it is often difficult to interpret, and can be contradictory. After an extensive review of the published literature, a proposal was generated that offers suggestions for anticoagulant treatment, considering available resources in Mexico.","Ávila-Castro, David; Ortiz-Torres, Guadalupe; Sánchez-Jara, Berenice; Valle-Cárdenas, Teresita; Aquino-Fernández, Efraín; González-Ávila, Ana I; Majluf-Cruz, Abraham",Gac Med Mex,24,15

response to COVID-19 to limit the movement of people affected the nature of consumer spending Consumption behaviour change, resulting from disasters or government-enforced regulation, is visible through spending displacement and response to fast-moving changes in circumstances This study examines student spending in the host cities of universities and how a pandemic, such as COVID-19, may reduce or eliminate the spending injections into the economy through displaced spending The value associated with the spending displacement is derived from a pre-Covid student survey conducted at the Potchefstroom Campus of the North-West University, South Africa It reflects on the types of consumer spending that occur and also quantifies the value of spending lost to the city's businesses as a result of the transition to a predominant eLearning model in response to lock-down regulations imposed by Govenment The university campuses in South Africa are known for their important role in both the development of the workforce's skills and the benefit this provides to the economy A university campus attracts students from outside the confines of the city which supports spending injection to the local businesses This benefit is of more value to the host city when it is situated in a rural setting and able to attract students from outside the local area, which has been the case with the Potchefstroom Campus The Campus experienced an increase in the enrolment of on-campus contact learning over the past decade, a trend that has been beneficial to the local business community and led to continued investment in various property markets A student survey provides insight into the spending patterns of students and is used to identify the retail spending benefit thereof, as well as the negative effects of its subsequent displacement, to the local retail industry The introduction of a lockdown and a move to online learning by universities raise the question as to how this might affect the value of student spending and how this displacement in spending will impact the local economy Some researchers indicate that various forms of spending displacement can be associated with COVID-19, while this research paper investigates how such displacement is relevant to the student population and the host economy Three forms of displacement are identified in the literature related to the COVID-19 environment, and the results from the survey are aligned with these displacements Considering the spatial aspect of consumption in the economic process, it was found that the value of student spending is not distributed evenly between retailers in the host economy The survey results highlight the fact that mobility plays a role in spending patterns and that retail spending occurs throughout the host city Within the context of COVID-19, the measures that restrict mobility and enforce social distancing, force trade to occur close to consumers' homes This implies that student spending shifts from the host city to their hometown residence as a result of the change to online studies The pre-Covid-19 student survey spending results revealed that 81 per cent of students' monthly retail spending takes place inside the host city with the rest spent outside The Covid-19 enforced move towards online learning, and the potentially longer-term shifts from contact to online learning, will have a significant spending displacement effect on the host city Concerning the type of consumption that occurs, the research revealed that students tend to spend on a variety of goods and services The largest monthly spending takes place on retail goods, which represents an average monthly value of R3 146 or 46 5 % of their monthly expenses, followed by accommodation at 31% In the case of COVID-19, the government regulations which limited contact education resulted in monthly losses in spending within the local economy on the purchase of retail-related services such as groceries and other goods, clothes and footwear, entertainment nd ospitality services Considering the time aspect of consumption, it was found that spending preferences related to time do exist The results show that students are indifferent to spending during the week or on weekends and that most students are content to stay within the host city during weekends No obvious time preference between the week and weekend for spending was found The results show that student spending represents significant spending in the host city and for the time the COVID-19 restrictions remain in place, the spending displacement and loss of income for local businesses will be significant The loss of student spending amounts to approximately R2 million daily This not only highlights the cost of enforced lockdown measures, but also provides important indicators to university management upon considering replacing the existing tuition model of contact learning with one of online learning Such a decision will lead to a significant negative impact on the economic activity of the Potchefstroom business community with farreaching implications for employment, income generation and wealth disbursement in this university city (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Die ekonomiese waarde van studente se besteding in die dorpe en stede waar hul universiteite geleë is, word in hierdie studie, in die lig van die COVID-19-pandemie, ondersoek Die studie is uniek deurdat dit 'n universiteitskampus in 'n landelike omgewing as gevallestudie bestudeer Die tendens is dat studentegetalle, afkomstig van buite die grense van die plaaslike ekonomie, deurentyd styg Dit het 'n positiewe impak op die ekonomiese aktiwiteite van die gasheerstad en bevoordeel ondernemings as gevolg van studente se bestedingspatrone Besteding deur voltydse kontakstudente is besonder voordelig vir die kleinhandelsektor in die gasheerstad Owerheidsinperkings op beweging wat ingestel is om die verspreiding van die koronavirus te verhoed, het hierdie besteding tydelik beëindig en die plaaslike ekonomie nadelig beïnvloed Die beperkings op die beweging van studente lei tot die verplasing van studentebesteding, weg vanaf die gasheerstad, met 'n kosteverlies vir die kleinhandelsektor van gemiddeld nagenoeg R2 miljoen per dag Die lengte van die inperking op die normale werking van die universiteit kan dus oor die langer termyn 'n wesentlike effek op die plaaslike kleinhandelmark van die gasheerstad hê, met verlore werksgeleenthede en die sluit van besighede as 'n realiteit Die onderskeie tipes bestedingsverplasings wat in die literatuur met rampe geassosieer word, word uitgelig Die resultate is nie net van toepassing gedurende die viruspandemie nie, maar toon ook aan wat die negatiewe permanente langtermynimpak

METHODS: County-level COVID-19 case, death, and population counts were downloaded from USAFacts.org. The 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme was collapsed into two categories called metropolitan (large central, large fringe, medium, and small metropolitans) and nonmetropolitan (micropolitan/noncore). Daily COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates were computed to show temporal trends for each of these two categories. Maps showing the ratio of nonmetropolitan to metropolitan COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates by state identify states with higher rates in nonmetropolitan areas than in metropolitan areas in each of the three 11-week periods. FINDINGS: In the period between March 1 and October 18, 2020, 13.8% of the 8,085,214 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 10.7% of the 217,510 deaths occurred among people residing in nonmetropolitan counties. The nonmetropolitan incidence and mortality trends steadily increased and surpassed those in metropolitan areas, beginning in early August. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relatively small size of the US population living in nonmetropolitan areas, these areas have an equal need for testing, health care personnel, and mitigation resources. Having state-specific rural data allow the development of prevention messages that are tailored to the sociocultural context of rural locations.","Matthews, Kevin A; Ullrich, Fred; Gaglioti, Anne H; Dugan, Susan; Chen, May S; Hall, Diane M",J Rural Health,24,24

This challenge will be most evident for organisations as they need to ensure that all stakeholders adhere to preventive behaviours to resume in-person business operations. While various information systems (IS) have emerged to address this challenge, they remain limited in scope and fall short of helping users navigate the evolving practices and guidelines of a pandemic. To address this shortcoming, we adopt the design science research approach to derive design principles for IS supporting the breaking of established habits and promotion of preventive behaviours.

Pode ser subdividida em industrial e de subsistência. A suinocultura de subsistência caracteriza-se pela produção tradicional, com baixo grau de investimento financeiro e baixo emprego de tecnologia. Nesses casos a produção é destinada ao consumo próprio ou à comercialização em associação com outras atividades. A presente dissertação está dividida em 3 capítulos. No capítulo 1 foi descrito o perfil da suinocultura na Região Metropolitana de Curitiba, avaliado por meio da aplicação in loco de um questionário, conversa geral sobre questões sanitárias e observação pessoal. Participaram da pesquisa 62 propriedades rurais distribuídas em 14 municípios da região. Observou-se que a atividade é desenvolvida de modo geral, como uma atividade de subsistência em pequenas propriedades e com a criação de poucos suínos. Também se observou que a mão de obra é essencialmente familiar e que todos os entrevistados praticavam a suinocultura em associação com outras atividades, sendo o cultivo de milho e a criação de aves os mais presentes. No capítulo 2 foi apresentada uma revisão de literatura sobre alimentos alternativos aos comumente utilizados na produção intensiva de suínos. Foi descrito que uma grande diversidade de alimentos pode ser usada na criação de suínos, sendo que, trata-se de culturas em momentos de produção abundante ou que estão disponíveis na propriedade, resíduos industriais e resíduos alimentares domésticos. Esses alimentos geralmente são ricos em umidade, têm grande variação da composição nutricional e muitos possuem compostos antinutricionais em diferentes concentrações. Mesmo assim, são uma boa opção a pequenos produtores que tem dificuldade em arcar com os custos de rações comerciais balanceadas. No capítulo 3 foi apresentada uma revisão bibliográfica sobre as principais características das vitaminas e minerais e as consequências de suas deficiências e excessos na alimentação de suínos. Esses nutrientes atuam como coenzimas em muitas reações, estão envolvidos no metabolismo de proteínas, carboidratos e lipídios, entre outras funções. Tanto a deficiência quanto o excesso podem acarretar em prejuízos a saúde dos suínos. As consequências da deficiência ou excesso das vitaminas e minerais estão geralmente associadas a redução do ganho de peso, problemas reprodutivos, ósseos, dermatológicos e manifestações neurológicas.","HORWAT, DARLENY ELIANE GARCIA",,24,1

Therefore, we aim to describe the distribution of these risk factors across Europe. Subject and Methods: Prevalence of risk factors for severe COVID-19 was identified based on interview for 73,274 Europeans aged 50+ participating in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) in 2017. Burden of disease was estimated using population data from Eurostat. Results: A total of 75.3% of the study population (corresponding to app. 60 million European men and 71 million women) had at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19, 45.9% (app. 36 million men and 43 million women) had at least two factors and 21.2% (app. 17 million men and 20 million women) had at least three risk factors. The prevalences of underlying medical conditions ranged from 4.5% for cancer to 41.4% for hypertension, and the region-specific prevalence of having at least three risk factors ranged from 18.9% in Northern Europe to 24.6% in Eastern Europe. Conclusions: Information about the prevalences of risk factors might help authorities to identify the most vulnerable subpopulations with multiple risk factors of severe COVID-19 disease and thus to decide appropriate strategies to mitigate the pandemic.","Ahrenfeldt, L.

Decarbonising the power sector is now at the centre of global and European policies. As the IPCC highlights, pathways where the power sector rapidly decarbonises by 2030 have higher chances of keeping global warming below 1.5$^\circ$C. The electricity sector should be fully decarbonised by 2050 to meet either the 1.5$^\circ$C or 2$^\circ$C targets. This means that EU policy efforts should focus on supporting a maximum reduction of emissions per unit of electricity by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050. Reaching these targets is one of the most pressing questions EU policymakers face today. In light of the COVID-19 crisis, EU policies should guide a cost-effective, reliable and environmentally sound transition of the power sector, benefiting EU research and innovation and its citizens. This meta-analysis provides a novel view on historical data and compares data from modelling scenarios identified in the literature. It assesses the current and future role of nuclear energy in decarbonizing the EU power sector, while reviewing socio-economic implications that could arise if limited public support nearly excludes nuclear fission electricity from the future EU power mix.

HYPOTHESIS: COVID-19 infection may result in cardiovascular manifestations leading to worse clinical outcome. METHODS: Fifty four severe and critical patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. Risk factors predicting the severity of COVID-19 were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 54 patients (56.1 ± 13.5 years old, 66.7% male) with COVID-19, 39 were diagnosed as severe and 15 as critical cases. The occurrence of diabetes, the level of D-dimer, inflammatory and cardiac markers in critical cases were significantly higher. Troponin I (TnI) elevation occurred in 42.6% of all the severe and critical patients. Three patients experienced hypotension at admission and were all diagnosed as critical cases consequently. Hypotension was found in one severe case and seven critical cases during hospitalization. Sinus tachycardia is the most common type of arrythmia and was observed in 23 severe patients and all the critical patients. Atrioventricular block and ventricular tachycardia were observed in critical patients at end stage while bradycardia and atrial fibrillation were less common. Mild pericardial effusion was observed in one severe case and five critical cases. Three critical cases suffered new onset of heart failure. Hypotension during treatment, severe myocardial injury and pericardial effusion were independent risk factors predicting the critical status of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: This study has systemically observed the impact of COVID-19 on cardiovascular system, including myocardial injury, blood pressure, arrythmia and cardiac function in severe and critical cases. Monitoring of vital signs and cardiac function of COVID-19 patients and applying potential interventions especially for those with hypotension during treatment, severe myocardial injury or pericardial effusion, is of vital importance.","Chen, Qingxing; Xu, Lili; Dai, Yongbin; Ling, Yunlong; Mao, Jiahao; Qian, Juying; Zhu, Wenqing; Di, Wencheng; Ge, Junbo",Clin. cardiol,24,33

As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 in Zhejiang province. Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance"" for clinical practice. The ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance"" strategy included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological balance. Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinary personalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect. The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate of RT-PCR results. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in 10%patients' blood samples at acute period and 50%of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces. We also isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely identifying cytokine storms and application of artificial liver blood purification system. The ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance"" strategy effectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality. Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviral effects in COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine storms. The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favored the balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness. For cases of severe illness, early and also short period of moderate glucocorticoid was supported. Patients with oxygenation index below 200 mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center. Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended. Patients with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was not recommended except for patients with long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT), meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal microbial dysbiosis with decreased probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, so nutritional and gastrointestinal function should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore,we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis. We also integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine. We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation. It remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Therefore, two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results. However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.","Xu, Kaijin; Cai, Hongliu; Shen, Yihong; Ni, Qin; Chen, Yu; Hu, Shaohua; Li, Jianping; Wang, Huafen; Yu, Liang; Huang, He; Qiu, Yunqing; Wei, Guoqing; Fang, Qiang; Zhou, Jianying; Sheng, Jifang; Liang, Tingbo; Li, Lanjuan",Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,24,16

The growing problem of vaccine hesitancy may affect the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine. We examined the individual, communication and social determinants associated with vaccines uptake. METHODS: Data come from a nationwide online probability-based panel of 1012 representative adults in the United States and the survey was conducted before the vaccines were available. People under the federal poverty level and racial and ethnic minorities were oversampled. Our outcome variables of interest were likelihood of vaccinating self and likelihood of vaccinating people under one's care (such as children) measuring behavioral intentions. Independent variables included perceptions of risk, exposure to different media for COVID-19 news, political party identification, confidence in scientists and social determinants of health. Logistic regression analysis was used to ascertain the effects of independent variables on the two outcome variables. RESULTS: The results indicated that 68 and 65% agreed to get the vaccine for themselves and people under their care, respectively. Risk perceptions (severity of and susceptibility to COVID-19) were significantly associated with vaccine uptake. People who relied on ""conservative"" news outlets, Republicans, and who had low confidence in scientists are least likely to vaccinate self or children. Non-Hispanic Blacks and those with least schooling were also less likely to receive vaccine for themselves or people in their care. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified race/ethnicity, risk perceptions, exposure to different media for COVID-19 news, party identification and confidence in scientists as factors that would be affecting COVID-19 vaccine uptake. The good news is that these are addressable through strategic public health communications, but a lot of work remains to be done with some urgency.","Viswanath, K; Bekalu, Mesfin; Dhawan, Dhriti; Pinnamaneni, Ramya; Lang, Jenna; McLoud, Rachel",BMC Public Health,24,10

Experimentally measured structure factors have been used to determine and characterize charge density via the multipole model (MM) and the maximum entropy method (MEM). Theoretical investigation of the electron density and the electronic structure has been performed in the finite basis set density functional theory (DFT) framework. Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM), deformation densities and Laplacians maps have been used to compare theoretical and experimental results. MM experimental results and predictions from theory differ with respect to the sign and/or magnitude of the Laplacian at the N-O bond critical point (BCP), depending on the treatment of n values of the MM radial functions. Such Laplacian differences in the N-O bond case are discussed with respect to a lack of flexibility in the MM radial functions also reported by Rykounov et al. [Acta Cryst. (2011), B67, 425-436]. BCP Hessian eigenvalues show qualitatively matching results between MM and DFT. In addition, the theoretical analysis used domain-averaged fermi holes (DAFH), natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and localized (LOC) orbitals to characterize the N-O bond as a single &#963; bond with marginal &#960; character. Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR) has been employed to compare to the MM refinement results and/or neutron dataset C-H bond lengths and to crystal or single molecule geometry optimizations, including considerations of anisotropy of H atoms.

In this study, a prototype of a cost-effective sterilization box is developed to disinfect small items. The box utilizes ultra violet (UV) radiation with heat. For performance assessment, two studies were performed. First, IgG (glycoprotein, a model protein similar to that of spike glycoprotein of SARS-COV-2) was incubated under UV and heat sterilization. An incubation with UV at 70 °C for 15 min was found to be effective in unfolding and aggregation of the protein. At optimized condition, the hydrodynamic size of the protein increased to ~171 nm from ~5 nm of the native protein. Similarly, the OD280 values also increased from 0.17 to 0.78 indicating the exposure of more aromatic moieties and unfolding of the protein. The unfolding and aggregation of the protein were further confirmed by the intrinsic fluorescence measurement and FTIR studies, showing a 70% increase in the ß-sheets and a 22% decrease in the &#945;-helixes of the protein. The designed box was effective in damaging the protein's native structure indicating the effective inactivation of the SARS-COV-2. Furthermore, the incubation at 70 °C for 15 min inside the chamber resulted in 100% antibacterial efficacy for the clinically relevant E.coli bacteria as well as for bacteria collected from daily use items. It is the first detailed performance study on the efficacy of using UV irradiation and heat together for disinfection from virus and bacteria.","Mahanta, Nilkamal; Saxena, Varun; Pandey, Lalit M; Batra, Priyanka; Dixit, U S",Environ Res,24,13

The implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on IBD patients' management were assessed in our Tertiary Gastroenterology Center in Bucharest, Romania. METHODS: Medical records of IBD patients admitted between 15th of March and 15th of August 2020 were retrospectively reviewed and compared to a control cohort of consecutive IBD patients admitted to our unit during the corresponding period of 2019. RESULTS: There was a highly significant shift towards one-day hospitalization during the referral period in 2020 for IBD cases (91% in 2020 vs 82.2% in 2019, p=0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between the distribution of patient's gender, IBD phenotype or newly diagnosed IBD cases. A significantly lower proportion of admitted patients received 5-aminosalicylic acid (29% vs 41.2%, p=0.0001), whereas a substantially higher number of patients were prescribed biological therapy in 2020 in comparison to the corresponding 2019-time frame (79.5% vs 57.9%, p<0.0001). The distribution of the biological agent used was significantly different in 2019 in comparison to the 2020 period mainly due to the increase in vedolizumab prescription in 2020 (p<0.0001). During the study period in 2020, seven IBD patients (1.7%) were diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) infection, all of them with mild symptoms without impact on the IBD course. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic led to reorganizing medical care, limiting the hospital admissions in favor of severe IBD cases, favoring telemedicine for mild disease and optimization of treatment for moderate to severe IBD with an increased use of biologicals aimed to maximize the risk/benefit ratio. Incidence of SARS-Cov2 infection during the first wave of COVID-19 infection in our study group was 1.7% and did not adversely impact the IBD disease course.","Vadan, Roxana; Iacob, Razvan; Costache, Roxana; Stroie, Tudor; Saizu, Ionut Adrian; Iacob, Speranta; Gheorghe, Liliana; Diculescu, Mircea; Gheorghe, Cristian",J Gastrointestin Liver Dis,24,18

METHODS: We reviewed the clinical documentation of six consecutive COVID-19 patients with primary spinal epidural abscess that we surgically managed over a 2-month period. These cases were analyzed for what concerns both the viral infection and the spinal abscess. RESULTS: The abscesses were primary in all cases indicating that no evident infective source was found. A primary abscess represents the rarest form of spinal epidural abscess, which is usually secondary to invasive procedures or spread from adjacent infective sites, such as spondylodiscitis, generally occurring in patients with diabetes, obesity, cancer, or other chronic diseases. In all cases, there was mild lymphopenia but the spinal abscess occurred regardless of the severity of the viral disease, immunologic state, or presence of bacteremia. Obesity was the only risk factor and was reported in two patients. All patients but one were hypertensive. The preferred localizations were cervical and thoracic, whereas classic abscess generally occur at the lumbar level. No patient had a history of pyogenic infection, even though previous asymptomatic bacterial contaminations were reported in three cases. CONCLUSION: We wonder about the concentration of this uncommon disease in such a short period. To our knowledge, cases of spinal epidural abscess in COVID-19 patients have not been reported to date. We hypothesize that, in our patients, the spinal infection could have depended on the coexistence of an initially asymptomatic bacterial contamination. The well-known COVID-19-related endotheliitis might have created the conditions for retrograde bacterial invasion to the correspondent spinal epidural space. Furthermore, spinal epidural abscess carries a significantly high morbidity and mortality. It is difficult to diagnose, especially in compromised COVID-19 patients but should be kept in mind as early diagnosis and treatment are crucial.","Talamonti, G; Colistra, Davide; Crisà, Francesco; Cenzato, Marco; Giorgi, Pietro; D039,; Aliberti, Giuseppe",J. neurol,24,10

STUDY DESIGN: An observational study was perfomed by Italian ART centers and online forums. In this study, infertile couples candidate to ART and whose treatment was blocked due to the COVID-19 lockdown were enrolled through an online survey. The psychological impact of COVID-19 was measured by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and by a short form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI); Self-perceived anxiety related either to pregnancy safety and to economic crisis measured by VAS scale. RESULTS: 627 patients completed the survey. The COVID-19 lock-down had a moderate/severe psychological impact on infertile patients (mean IES-R score 36.4 ± 16.6). The mean STAI score was 49.8 ± 15.3, with an overall incidence of STAI > 36 of 71 %. The mean VAS scale for anxiety perception was 45.3 ± 15.3. Women were more emotionally distressed, anxious and depressed than men (36.8 ± 16.4 vs 31.0 ± 18.4 for IES-R, respectively; p = 0.03). Notwithstanding the uncertainty about pregnancy safety, 64.6 % of respondents chose to maintain their reproductive programme. Economic crisis induced 11.5 % of the surveyed patients to give up their ART program. Respondents who had at least one relative affected by COVID-19 had a significantly higher IES-R score and anxiety VAS, but not higher STAI scores, than patients belonging to unaffected families. CONCLUSION(S): COVID-19 pandemic itself and the recommendation to stop ART program generated higher distress levels in infertile couples. The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic in infertility patients should not be underestimated, and a specific psychological support should be planned.","Esposito, Veronica; Rania, Erika; Lico, Daniela; Pedri, Sara; Fiorenza, Alessia; Strati, Marina Francesca; Conforti, Alessandro; Marrone, Vinenzo; Carosso, Andrea; Revelli, Alberto; Zullo, Fulvio; Di Carlo, Costantino; Venturella, Roberta",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,24,1

We investigated the association between IFN-&#945;-2b and the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 1401 patients were enrolled, with 852 (60.8%) patients receiving 5 000 000 U of IFN-&#945;-2b via aerosol inhalation twice daily. The primary outcome was a composite measure consisting of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. A subgroup analysis was performed to investigate the impact of the IFN-&#945;-2b initiation schedule on symptom onset. RESULTS: The risk probability for crude endpoints was lower in the IFN-&#945;-2b group (3.8%) than in the non-IFN-&#945;-2b group (9.3%, P < .001). After adjusting the confounding factors, IFN-&#945;-2b therapy achieved a reduction of 64% in occurrence of endpoint events (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.62). In the subgroup analysis, compared with patients who received IFN-&#945;-2b treatment 0-2 days after symptom onset, the hazard ratio for endpoints was 2.2 (95% CI, 0.43-11.13) in patients who received the therapy 3-5 days after symptom onset, 5.89 (95% CI, 0.99-35.05) in patients who received the therapy 6-8 days after symptom onset, and remained at a high level thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: IFN-&#945;-2b aerosol inhalation therapy may be associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19, and delayed IFN-&#945;-2b intervention was associated with increased probabilities of risk events. Further randomized clinical trials are needed to validate the preliminary findings of this study.","Yu, Jiong; Lu, Xuan; Tong, Ling; Shi, Xiaowei; Ma, Jing; Lv, Feifei; Wu, Jian; Pan, Qiaoling; Yang, Jinfeng; Cao, Hongcui; Li, Lanjuan",,24,16

Cytokine storm has major role is Covid-19 pathogenesis. The association between inflammation and oxidative stress is well stablished. In this article, we aim to assess oxidative stress markers in Covid-19 patients compare to the healthy subjects. METHOD: A total of 48 persons (24 with Covid-19 and 24 controls) were evaluated in this research. Serum oxidative stress markers including Malondialdehyde (MDA), total oxidant status (TOS), activity of catalase (CAT) and super oxide dismutase (SOD) were measured alongside routine laboratory tests. RESULTS: Patients group were divided into ICU and Non-ICU groups. ESR, CRP and serum level of ferritin were significantly higher in case group. Serum level of albumin was significantly lower in Covid-19 patients. Serum MDA and TOS was significantly increased in Covid-19 patients. Also, Covid-19 patients had higher serum activity of CAT and GPX. CONCLUSION: Oxidative stress markers are significantly elevated in Covid-19 patients. This may have significant role in mechanism of disease development. In the fight against Covid-19, as a global struggle, all possible treatments demand more attention. So, Covid-19 patients may benefit from strategies for reducing or preventing oxidative stress.","Mehri, Fereshteh; Rahbar, Amir Hossein; Ghane, Elaheh Talebi; Souri, Bahram; Esfahani, Maryam",Arch. med. res,24,23

Laboratory diagnostic tests and imaging modalities are two test groups used for the detection of COVID-19. Nowadays, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and computed tomography (CT) have been frequently utilized in the clinic. Some limitations that confront with these tests are false-negative results, tests redone for follow-up procedure, high cost, and unable to do for all patients. To overcome these limitations, modified and alternative tests must be considered. Among these tests, RdRp/Hel RT-PCR assay had the lowest diagnostic limitation and highest sensitivity and specificity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in both respiratory tract and nonrespiratory tract clinical specimens.

Hence, immunoassays for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are introduced rapidly without requiring FDA emergency use authorization approval. Thus, evaluation of test performance predominantly relies on laboratories. This study aimed to evaluate the test performance of recently launched commercial immunoassays in serum and plasma samples. METHODS: 51 serum samples from 26 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection after end of quarantine and 25 control patients were analyzed using anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassays from Roche, Euroimmun and Epitope to assess diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. 20 matching pairs of serum and plasma samples were included to analyze comparability between different specimens. RESULTS: Overall, a diagnostic sensitivity of 92.3%, 96.2-100% and 100% with a respective diagnostic specificity of 100%, 100% and 84-86% for the immunoassays from Roche, Euroimmun and Epitope were determined. In total, 84-96% of samples were correctly classified as negative and 92.3-95.2% as positive. The level of concordance between plasma- and serum-based testing diverged between the assays (Epitope r2 = 0.97; Euroimmun r2 = 0.91; Roche r2 = 0.76). CONCLUSIONS: The immunoassays from Euroimmun and Roche revealed a higher specificity than the Epitope assay without a substantial drop of diagnostic sensitivity. Significant differences between plasma- and serum-based testing highlights the need for determination of appropriate cut-offs per specimen type. Hence, there is an urgent need for test harmonization and establishment of quality standards for an appropriate use of COVID-19 serological tests.","Haselmann, Verena; Kittel, Maximilian; Gerhards, Catharina; Thiaucourt, Margot; Eichner, Romy; Costina, Victor; Neumaier, Michael",Clin Chim Acta,24,20

METHODS: This is a single-center prospective observational cohort study in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure. Immediately after intensive care unit (ICU) admission patients were allocated to CVP treatment following pre-specified criteria to rapidly identify those patients potentially susceptible for this treatment. A propensity score adjustment [inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) analysis] was implemented to account rigorously for imbalances in prognostic variables between the treatment groups. RESULTS: We included 120 patients of whom 48 received CVP. Thirty percent were female with a median age of 66 years [25th-75th percentile 54-75]. Eighty-eight percent of patients presented with severe acute respiratory failure as displayed by a median paO2/FiO2 ratio (Horowitz Index) of 92 [77-150]. All patients required any kind of ventilatory support with more than half of them (52%) receiving invasive ventilation. Thirty-day ICU overall survival (OS) was 69% in the CVP group and 54% in the non-CVP group (log-rank p = 0.049), respectively. After weighing the time-to-event data for the IPTW, the favorable association between CVP and OS became even stronger (log-rank p = 0.035). Moreover, an exploratory analysis showed an overall survival benefit of CVP therapy for patients with non-invasive ventilation (Hazard ratio 0.12 95% CI 0.03-0.57, p = 0.007) CONCLUSION: Administration of CVP in patients with acute respiratory failure related to COVID-19 is associated with improved ICU survival rates.","Hatzl, Stefan; Posch, Florian; Sareban, Nazanin; Stradner, Martin; Rosskopf, Konrad; Reisinger, Alexander C; Eller, Philipp; Schörghuber, Michael; Toller, Wolfgang; Sloup, Zdenka; Prüller, Florian; Gütl, Katharina; Pilz, Stefan; Rosenkranz, Alexander R; Greinix, Hildegard T; Krause, Robert; Schlenke, Peter; Schilcher, Gernot",Ann Intensive Care,24,24

However, the application of the conventional back-estimation approach is currently limited due to the methodological challenges and various uncertainties. This study systematically performed meta-analysis for WBE datasets and investigated the use of data-driven models for the COVID-19 community prevalence in lieu of the conventional WBE back-estimation approach. Three different data-driven models, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN), and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were applied to the multi-national WBE dataset. To evaluate the robustness of these models, predictions for sixteen scenarios with partial inputs were compared against the actual prevalence reports from clinical testing. The performance of models was further validated using unseen data (data sets not included for establishing the model) from different stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Generally, ANN and ANFIS models showed better accuracy and robustness over MLR models. Air and wastewater temperature played a critical role in the prevalence estimation by data-driven models, especially MLR models. With unseen datasets, ANN model reasonably estimated the prevalence of COVID-19 (cumulative cases) at the initial phase and forecasted the upcoming new cases in 2-4 days at the post-peak phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study provided essential information about the feasibility and accuracy of data-driven estimation of COVID-19 prevalence through the WBE approach.","Li, Xuan; Kulandaivelu, Jagadeeshkumar; Zhang, Shuxin; Shi, Jiahua; Sivakumar, Muttucumaru; Mueller, Jochen; Luby, Stephen; Ahmed, Warish; Coin, Lachlan; Jiang, Guangming",Sci Total Environ,24,1

Several CPPs were found in the proteome of viruses such as Tat originated from human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), and VP22 derived from herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). In the current study, a wide-range of CPPs was identified in the proteome of SARS-CoV-2, a new member of coronaviruses family, using in silico analyses. These CPPs may play a main role for high penetration of virus into cells and infection of host. At first, we submitted the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 to CellPPD web server that resulted in a huge number of CPPs with ten residues in length. Afterward, we submitted the predicted CPPs to C2Pred web server for evaluation of the probability of each peptide. Then, the uptake efficiency of each peptide was investigated using CPPred-RF and MLCPP web servers. Next, the physicochemical properties of the predicted CPPs including net charge, theoretical isoelectric point (pI), amphipathicity, molecular weight, and water solubility were calculated using protparam and pepcalc tools. In addition, the probability of membrane binding potential and cellular localization of each CPP were estimated by Boman index using APD3 web server, D factor, and TMHMM web server. On the other hand, the immunogenicity, toxicity, allergenicity, hemolytic potency, and half-life of CPPs were predicted using various web servers. Finally, the tertiary structure and the helical wheel projection of some CPPs were predicted by PEP-FOLD3 and Heliquest web servers, respectively. These CPPs were divided into: a) CPP containing tumor homing motif (RGD) and/or tumor penetrating motif (RXXR); b) CPP with the highest Boman index; c) CPP with high half-life (~100 hour) in mammalian cells, and d) CPP with +5.00 net charge. Based on the results, we found a large number of novel CPPs with various features. Some of these CPPs possess tumor-specific motifs which can be evaluated in cancer therapy. Furthermore, the novel and potent CPPs derived from SARS-CoV-2 may be used alone or conjugated to some sequences such as nuclear localization sequence (NLS) for vaccine and drug delivery.","Kardani, Kimia; Bolhassani, Azam",PLoS One,24,29

The virus induces many immune-modulatory cytokines and chemokines which help in the intravascular coagulation and create a pro-thrombotic environment along with pulmonary embolism and thrombocytopenia. Different types of innate and adaptive immune cells and their granular contents regulate the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial and platelet dysfunctions which correlate the involvement of platelets with myocardial injury and intravascular thrombi directly or indirectly.

Muslims, whose political and civil society elite had largely supported the Sri Lankan state and security forces, welcomed the end of the war and the defeat of the Tamil Tigers given the history of the community with the LTTE. The expectations by the Muslims (and other communities) that peace would return to the country, were quickly dashed as it appeared that a new extremist Sinhala-Buddhist nationalist movement targeting religious minorities especially the Muslims would emerge as the country grappled with post-war reconciliation. The rise of anti-Muslim rhetoric, hate speech, and incitement to violence against the community has pushed some Muslims to think that they have become the new focus for Sinhala-Buddhist extremists in the wake of the defeat of the Tamil Tigers. With suspicions of the complicity of the state apparatus in the anti-Muslim campaign, there are serious concerns around the role and place of minorities (non-Sinhala and non-Buddhist) in the future makeup of the country. While there is no concrete evidence on the state’s support for such an action, it is clear that the reluctance of the state to bring to justice those responsible for hate speech and incitement to violence since 2009 raises some serious questions about impartiality. In addition, with the increase of detentions and scrutiny of the Muslim community’s post-Easter Sunday attacks and the recent treatment of the Muslim community in the response to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, including shutting down of key Muslim towns and the enforcement of forced cremations (which goes against Islamic teachings of dignified burials), there is much to ponder of an anti-Muslim strategy being mainstreamed and institutionalized by the state. This paper will seek to situate the present response to the COVID-19 pandemic by the state and its particular actions affecting the Muslim community amid a wider backdrop of a rise in anti-Muslim hatred and action. In order to understand this, the paper will seek to understand the reasoning behind why Muslims who supported the war against the Tamil Tigers, have now become the enemy for Sinhala-Buddhist extremists. It does this through primary and secondary data gathering including interviews conducted between July 2020 and February 2021. In so doing this paper will explore the development of Muslim political and religious identity by looking at a historical perspective.

The transmission of this virus has infected more than 18.92 million people as of August 6, 2020, with over half a million deaths across the globe; the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this a global pandemic. A multidisciplinary approach needs to be followed for diagnosis, treatment and tracking, especially between medical and computer sciences, so, a common ground is available to facilitate the research work at a faster pace. With this in mind, this survey paper aimed to explore and understand how and which different technological tools and techniques have been used within the context of COVID-19. The primary contribution of this paper is in its collation of the current state-of-the-art technological approaches applied to the context of COVID-19, and doing this in a holistic way, covering multiple disciplines and different perspectives. The analysis is widened by investigating Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches for the diagnosis, anticipate infection and mortality rate by tracing contacts and targeted drug designing. Moreover, the impact of different kinds of medical data used in diagnosis, prognosis and pandemic analysis is also provided. This review paper covers both medical and technological perspectives to facilitate the virologists, AI researchers and policymakers while in combating the COVID-19 outbreak.","Rasheed, Jawad; Jamil, Akhtar; Hameed, Alaa Ali; Aftab, Usman; Aftab, Javaria; Shah, Syed Attique; Draheim, Dirk",Chaos Solitons Fractals,24,24

The sample comprised 3,109 Turkish adults (49.98% males; Meanage = 38.64 ± 10.40). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses confirmed a two-factor structure (cognitive and emotional dimensions), with satisfactory reliability. The subscales were correlated with severity and self-efficacy related to COVID-19 and mental health. Women reported higher levels of emotional risk, overall risk, and severity than men. Findings indicate that the CPRS is a psychometrically-sound scale for assessing COVID-19 related perceived risk.

Primary precursors such as NO and CO dropped dramatically as early as 13 March 2020, due to school closures, but ambient ozone did not change. In this work we use a chemical box model in order to estimate regimes of ozone production before and after the lockdown. We constrain the model with observations in Quito (ozone, NOx, CO, and meteorology) and with estimations of traffic-associated VOCs that are tightly linked to CO. To this end, we use the closest observational data of VOC/CO ratios at an urban area that shares with Quito conditions of high altitude and is located in the tropics, namely Mexico City. A shift in the chemical regime after mobility restrictions was evaluated in light of the magnitude of radical losses to nitric acid and to hydrogen peroxide. With reduced NOx in the morning rush hour (lockdown conditions), ozone production rates at 08:30-10:30 increased from 4.2 to 17 to 9.7-23â¯ppbvâ¯h-1, respectively. To test further the observed shift in chemical regime, ozone production was recalculated with post-lockdown NOx levels, but setting VOCs to pre-lockdown conditions. This change tripled ozone production rates in the mid-morning and stayed higher throughout the day. In light of these findings, practical scenarios that present the potential for ozone accumulation in the ambient air are discussed.","Cazorla, María; Herrera, Edgar; Palomeque, Emilia; Saud, Nicolás",,24,1

OBJECTIVES: To examine the probabilities of a clinically meaningful reduction in mortality for remdesivir and systemic corticosteroids. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a probabilistic re-analysis of clinical trial data for corticosteroids and remdesivir in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 using a Bayesian random effects meta-analytic approach. Studies were identified from existing meta-analyses performed by the World Health Organization. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Posterior probabilities of an absolute decrease in mortality compared with control patients, by subgroups based on oxygen requirements, were calculated for corticosteroids and remdesivir. Probabilities of &#8805;1%, &#8805;2% and &#8805;5% absolute decrease in mortality were quantified. RESULTS: For patients needing mechanical ventilation, the probability of &#8805;1% absolute decrease in mortality was 4% for remdesivir and 93% for corticosteroids. For patients needing supplemental oxygen without mechanical ventilation, the probability of &#8805;1% absolute decrease in mortality was 81% for remdesivir and 93% for dexamethasone. Finally, for patients who did not need oxygen support, the probability of &#8805;1% absolute decrease in mortality was 29% for remdesivir and 4% for dexamethasone. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using a Bayesian analytic approach, remdesivir had low probability of achieving a clinically meaningful reduction in mortality, except for patients needing supplemental oxygen without mechanical ventilation. Corticosteroids were more promising for patients needing oxygen support, especially mechanical ventilation. While awaiting more definitive studies, this probabilistic interpretation of the evidence will help to guide treatment decisions for clinicians, as well as guideline and policy makers.","Lee, Todd C; McDonald, Emily G; Butler-Laporte, Guillaume; Harrison, Luke B; Cheng, Matthew P; Brophy, James M",Int J Infect Dis,24,13

Whether circulating cell-free MT-DNA quantitation could be used to predict the risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes remains undetermined.MethodsWe measured circulating MT-DNA levels in prospectively collected, cell-free plasma samples from 97 subjects with COVID-19 at hospital presentation. Our primary outcome was mortality. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission, intubation, vasopressor, and renal replacement therapy requirements were secondary outcomes. Multivariate regression analysis determined whether MT-DNA levels were independent of other reported COVID-19 risk factors. Receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve assessments were used to compare MT-DNA levels with established and emerging inflammatory markers of COVID-19.ResultsCirculating MT-DNA levels were highly elevated in patients who eventually died or required ICU admission, intubation, vasopressor use, or renal replacement therapy. Multivariate regression revealed that high circulating MT-DNA was an independent risk factor for these outcomes after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. We also found that circulating MT-DNA levels had a similar or superior area under the curve when compared against clinically established measures of inflammation and emerging markers currently of interest as investigational targets for COVID-19 therapy.ConclusionThese results show that high circulating MT-DNA levels are a potential early indicator for poor COVID-19 outcomes.FundingWashington University Institute of Clinical Translational Sciences COVID-19 Research Program and Washington University Institute of Clinical Translational Sciences (ICTS) NIH grant UL1TR002345.","Scozzi, Davide; Cano, Marlene; Ma, Lina; Zhou, Dequan; Zhu, Ji Hong; O039,; Halloran, Jane A; Goss, Charles; Rauseo, Adriana M; Liu, Zhiyi; Sahu, Sanjaya K; Peritore, Valentina; Rocco, Monica; Ricci, Alberto; Amodeo, Rachele; Aimati, Laura; Ibrahim, Mohsen; Hachem, Ramsey; Kreisel, Daniel; Mudd, Philip A; Kulkarni, Hrishikesh S; Gelman, Andrew E",JCI insight,24,7

This review discusses various oral manifestations of Covid-19 reported in the literature along with possible underlying mechanisms. The reported manifestations include taste impairment, oral mucosal changes (petechiae, ulcers, plaque-like lesions, reactivation of herpes simplex virus 1(HSV1), geographical tongue and desquamative gingivitis) and dry mouth. The prominent location for mucosal lesions are tongue, palate and labial mucosa. The exact pathogenesis of these oral symptoms is not known. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptors are expressed in abundance on oral mucosa allowing severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to infect them. Gustatory impairment along with olfactory changes is now listed as a symptom of Covid-19 by the World Health Organization, but further research is needed to confirm a link between reported additional oral symptoms and Covid-19.

Other potential risk factors include lack of exposure to sunlight, darker skin pigmentation, co-morbidities, poor diet, certain medications, disadvantaged social and economic status, and lifestyle factors such as smoking and excessive consumption of alcohol. A key question is to understand how and why certain groups of people are more susceptible to COVID-19, whether they have weakened immune systems and what the roles of good nutrition and specific micronutrients are in supporting immune functions. A varied and balanced diet with an abundance of fruits and vegetables and the essential nutrients like vitamin D, vitamin A, B vitamins (folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12), vitamin C and the minerals, Fe, Cu, Se and Zn are all known to contribute to the normal functions of the immune system. Avoidance of deficiencies and identification of suboptimal intakes of these micronutrients in targeted groups of patients and in distinct and highly sensitive populations could help to strengthen the resilience of people to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to highlight evidence-based public health messages, to prevent false and misleading claims about the benefits of foods and food supplements and to communicate clearly that the extent of knowledge between micronutrients and COVID-19 infection is still being explored and that no diet will prevent or cure COVID-19 infection.

However, almost all of the reported viral RdRp inhibitors (either repurposed drugs or new antiviral agents) lack selectivity against the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Herein, I discovered a new favipiravir derivative, (E)-N-(4-cyanobenzylidene)-6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide (cyanorona-20), as the first potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor with very high selectivity (209- and 45-fold more potent than favipiravir and remdesivir, respectively). Based on the significant reduction in the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 replication/copies, strong computational cyanorona-20 ligand-RdRp protein interactions, and anti-RdRp activity of the parent favipiravir drug, SARS-CoV-2 inhibition is thought to be mediated through the coronaviral-2 RdRp inhibition. This promising selective anti-COVID-19 compound is also, to the best of our knowledge, the first bioactive derivative of favipiravir, the known antiinfluenza and antiviral drug. This new nucleoside analog was designed, synthesized, characterized, computationally studied (through pharmacokinetic calculations along with computational molecular modeling and prediction), and biologically evaluated for its anti-COVID-19 activities (through a validated in vitro anti-COVID-19 assay). The results of the biological assay showed that cyanorona-20 surprisingly exhibited very significant anti-COVID-19 activity (anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC50 = 0.45 µM), and, in addition, it could be also a very promising lead compound for the design of new anti-COVID-19 agents. Cyanorona-20 is a new favipiravir derivative with promise for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In an online survey conducted in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic with over 1000 Swedish participants we found that distrust in the government to cope with financial (but not healthcare) challenges of the pandemic was negatively related to the feeling of financial security. In a structural equation model, we also show that trust in government to deal with financial challenges of COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on general well-being through the mediating channel of financial well-being. In addition, trust in government to deal with healthcare challenges of COVID-19 pandemic has a significant direct impact on individuals’ general well-being.

We evaluated hospital outcomes based on the adequacy of antibacterial therapy for bacterial pathogens in US patients. Methods: This multicenter retrospective study included patients with &gt;=24 hours of inpatient admission, &gt;=24 hours of antibiotic therapy, and discharge/death from March to November 2020 at 201 US hospitals in the BD Insights Research Database. Included patients had a test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and a positive bacterial culture (gram-positive or gram-negative). We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the impact of inadequate empiric therapy (IET), defined as therapy not active against the identified bacteria or no antimicrobial therapy in the 48 hours following culture, on in-hospital mortality and hospital and intensive care unit length of stay (LOS). Results: Of 438 888 SARS-CoV-2-tested patients, 39 203 (8.9%) had positive bacterial cultures. Among patients with positive cultures, 9.4% were SARS-CoV-2 positive, 74.4% had a gram-negative pathogen, 25.6% had a gram-positive pathogen, and 44.1% received IET for the bacterial infection. The odds of mortality were 21% higher for IET (odds ratio [OR], 1.21;95% CI, 1.10-1.33;P &lt; .001) compared with adequate empiric therapy.

Undirected graphs were constructed for the entire cortex in 17 FCD patients and 33 healthy controls using inter-regional similarity of [11C]ABP688 BPND. We assessed group differences in network integration between healthy controls and the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres of FCD patients. Compared to healthy controls, FCD patients showed reduced network efficiency and reduced small-world connectivity. The mGluR5 network of FCD patients was also less resilient to targeted removal of high centrality nodes, suggesting a less integrated network organization. In highly efficient hub nodes of FCD patients, we observed a significant negative correlation between local efficiency and duration of epilepsy only in the contralateral hemisphere, suggesting that some nodes may be more vulnerable to persistent epileptic activity. Our study provides the first in vivo evidence for a widespread reduction in cortical mGluR5 network integration in FCD patients. In addition, we find that ongoing epileptic activity may alter chemoarchitectural brain organization resulting in reduced efficiency in distant regions that are essential for network integration.","DuBois, Jonathan M; Mathotaarachchi, Sulantha; Rousset, Olivier G; Sziklas, Viviane; Sepulcre, Jorge; Guiot, Marie-Christine; Hall, Jeffery A; Massarweh, Gassan; Soucy, Jean-Paul; Rosa-Neto, Pedro; Kobayashi, Eliane",Neuroimage Clin,24,23

Whole genome sequencing was performed for some samples. The R.1 variant (B.1.1.316) was responsible for most infections in March, replacing the previous variant (B.1.1.214); the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant caused most infections in April and May; and the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was the most prevalent in July and August. There was no significant difference in copy numbers among the previous variant cases (n=29, median 3.0x104 copies/L), R.1 variant cases (n=28, 2.1x105 copies/L), Alpha variant cases (n=125, 4.1x105 copies/L), and Delta variant cases (n=106, 2.4x105 copies/L). Patients with Delta variant infection were significantly younger than those infected with R.1 and the previous variants, possibly because many elderly individuals in Tokyo were vaccinated between May and August.

Recently, diverse Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods were proposed to detect botnet attacks in IoT networks. However, highly imbalanced network traffic data in the training set often degrade the classification performance of state-of-the-art ML and DL models, especially in classes with relatively few samples. In this paper, we propose an efficient DL-based botnet attack detection algorithm that can handle highly imbalanced network traffic data. Specifically, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) generates additional minority samples to achieve class balance, while Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) learns hierarchical feature representations from the balanced network traffic data to perform discriminative classification. We develop DRNN and SMOTE-DRNN models with the Bot-IoT dataset, and the simulation results show that high-class imbalance in the training data adversely affects the precision, recall, F1 score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), geometric mean (GM) and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of the DRNN model. On the other hand, the SMOTE-DRNN model achieved better classification performance with 99.50% precision, 99.75% recall, 99.62% F1 score, 99.87% AUC, 99.74% GM and 99.62% MCC.

METHOD: This was a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence cross-sectional study in risk-stratified HCWs randomly selected from three main district hospitals in Oman. RESULTS: 1078 HCWs were included, with an overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 21%. The seropositivity rates in low-, variable-, and high-risk groups were 29%, 18%, and 17%, respectively (p-value < 0.001). The study found higher positivity in males (crude odds ratio [COR] 1.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28-2.3), and workers residing in high-prevalence areas (COR 2.09, 95% CI 1.42-3.07).

We first analyze the problem from a theoretical perspective, claiming that different lockdown policies (total lockdown, no lockdown or partial lockdown) may justified by different cost (concave or convex) structures of the economies. We then focus on a particular cost structure (convex costs) and we simulate a targeted optimal policy vs. a uniform optimal policy, by dividing the whole population in three demographic groups (young, adults and old). We also simulate the dynamic of the pandemic with no policy implemented. Simulations highlighted the fact that: a) a policy of lockdown is always better than the \emph{laissez faire} policy, because it limits the costs that the pandemic generates in an uncontrolled situation; b) a targeted policy based on age of the individuals outperforms a uniform policy in terms of costs that it generates, being a targeted policy less costly and equally effective in the control of the pandemic.","Gubar, Elena; Policardo, Laura; Carrera, Edgar J.

One of the most affected populations is long-term care (LTC) residents. This increased separation from their families and society has created an additive effect to their baseline physical and mental ailments. We investigated the change in depression and anxiety over time in residents of one LTC facility during this crisis. Aim: The aim of the intervention was to reduce the impact of social isolation by modifying recreational activities to include faceto-face visits, music therapy, and similar activities. Methods: Staff collected PHQ-9 and NPIQ (Neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire) scores of all residents in the facility before implementing modified activities. Between 8/10 and 10/3/2020 we had a modified event calendar. Following the 8-week intervention, PHQ-9 and NPIQ scores were re-recorded. All LTC residents were eligible. Short-term residents, hospice patients, and those who did not participate in the intervention were excluded from analysis. Our primary outcome was change in depression and anxiety. Our secondary outcomes were change in weight, ulcers, and falls (MDS quality metrics). We hypothesized there would be a positive change in PHQ9 and NPIQ scores over time. We analyzed our data using paired sample t-tests. Analyses were conducted using SPSS v. 26. Results: 97 residents participated this intervention with an age range of 63-103 (mean = 86;SD 8). Participants' mean PHQ-9 scores improved significantly after participation in activities (9.1 vs 6.3) with a mean difference of 2.804 (CI 1.924-3.684, p&lt;.001). Similarly, mean NPIQ scored showed a similar trend (18.74 vs 14.94) with a mean difference of 3.804 (CI 3.098-4.510, p &lt;.001). There were no significant differences in falls, weight, or ulcers. Conclusions: This study highlights how COVID-19 has impacted LTC residents' mental health and suggests implementing modified recreational activities can improve the mental health of LTC residents. This is especially important as the pandemic, and associated restrictions, have lasted longer than anticipated. Therefore, LTC facilities should slowly and safely increase social interaction for residents whenever possible.","Sheikh, H. H. E. L.; Roy, H.; Bender, A.

This article focuses on the academic challenges for the discipline, mainly in the field of education, research, and quality assurance. The efforts of the European Region of the World Organisation of National Colleges, Academies, and Academic Associations of General Practitioners/Family Physicians (WONCA Europe) to support academic sustainability of the discipline in the time of pandemic are presented. Medical education was affected by the pandemic, threatening both its productivity and quality. Emerging new educational methods might be promising, but the results of their rapid implementation remain uncertain. A relatively small number of publications related to COVID-19 and general practice is available in the medical literature. There is a shortage of original data from general practice settings. This contrasts with the crucial role of GPs in fighting a pandemic. COVID-19 outbreak has opened widely new research areas, which should be explored by GPs. Maintaining the quality of care and safety of all patients during the COVID-19 pandemic is the utmost priority. Many of them suffer from poor access or inadequate management of their problems. Rapid implementation of telemedicine brought both threats and opportunities. The COVID-19 pandemic also challenged doctors' safety and well-being.

Methods: Chest CT and clinical data of 103 patients who were confirmed as COVID-19 in January 2020 were collected retrospectively. According to diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (trial version 5), all the patients were classified into common(n=58), severe (n=36) and critical (n=9) types, and their clinical findings, laboratory examination and CT finding were analyzed. CT features included distribution, location, size, shape, edge, number and density of the lesion, percentage of pneumonia lesions of the whole lung and extra-pulmonary manifestations. The CT features among different clinical types were compared using χ 2test or Fisher's exact probability. Comparisons of age, duration from onset to CT examination, and percentage of pneumonic lesions to total lung volume among different types were performed by using analysis of variance (normal distribution) or Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (non-normal distribution). Results: In terms of clinical manifestations, the patients with critical COVID-19 were more common in elderly men, with a median age of 65 years. Fever was the first symptom in 49 (84%) of 58 common patients, and also the first symptom in both severe and critical COVID-19 patients. The incidence of coughing in severe (25/36, 69%) and critical (6/9, 67%) COVID-19 patients was higher than that in common patients (20/58, 34%). All critical patients had dyspnea. CT showed the common COVID-19 was located in bilateral lung (40/58, 71%)with multiple (40/58, 69%), ground glass (31/58, 52%) or mixed (25/58, 43%)opacities (56/58, 97%), while all the severe and critical COVID-19 were located in bilateral lung(100%) with multiple (34/36, 96%), patchy (33 /36, 92%), or mixed opacities (26/36, 72%) in severe patients, and with mixed opacities more than 3 cm in critical patients. As for the percentage of pneumonia focus in the whole lung volume, the common type (12.5%±6.1%) was significantly lower than the severe type (25.9%± 10.7%) and the critical type (47.2%±19.2%), with statistically significant differences(P&lt; 0.001 and 0.002 respectively), and the severe type COVID-19 was also significantly lower than the critical type (P= 0.032). Conclusions: CT and clinical features of different clinical types of COVID-19 pneumonia are different. Chest CT findings are characteristic, which can not only help the early diagnosis but also evaluate the clinical course and severity.","Huang, Lu; Han, Rui; Yu, Pengxin; Wang, Shaokang; Xia, Liming",Chin.

A global view using a systems science approach is necessary to recognize the close interactions between health of animals, humans and the environment. DISCUSSION: A model is developed initially by describing five sequential or parallel steps on how a RNA virus emerged from animals and became a pandemic: 1. Origins in the animal kingdom; 2. Transmission to domesticated animals; 3. Inter-species transmission to humans; 4. Local epidemics; 5. Global spread towards a pandemic. The next stage identifies global level determinants from the physical environments, the biosphere and social environment that influence these steps to derive a generic conceptual model. It identifies that future pandemics are likely to emerge from ecological processes (climate change, loss of biodiversity), anthropogenic social processes (i.e. corporate interests, culture and globalization) and world population growth. Intervention would therefore require modifications or dampening these generators and prevent future periodic pandemics that would reverse human development. Addressing issues such as poorly planned urbanization, climate change and deforestation coincide with SDGs such as sustainable cities and communities (Goal 11), climate action (Goal 13) and preserving forests and other ecosystems (Goal 15). This will be an added justification to address them as global priorities. Some determinants in the model are poorly addressed by SDGs such as the case of population pressures, cultural factors, corporate interests and globalization. The overarching process of globalization will require modifications to the structures, processes and mechanisms of global governance. The defects in global governance are arguably due to historical reasons and the neo-liberal capitalist order. This became evident especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 when the vaccination roll-out led to violations of universal values of equity and right to life by some of the powerful and affluent nations. A systems approach leads us to a model that shows the need to tackle several factors, some of which are not adequately addressed by SDGs and require restructuring of global governance and political economy.","Thoradeniya, Tharanga; Jayasinghe, Saroj",Global Health,24,1

To address these challenges, we propose a novel three-component method, i.e., 1) a deep multiple instance learning component with instance-level attention to jointly classify the bag and also weigh the instances, 2) a bag-level data augmentation component to generate virtual bags by reorganizing high confidential instances, and 3) a self-supervised pretext component to aid the learning process. We have systematically evaluated our method on the CT images of 229 COVID-19 cases, including 50 severe and 179 non-severe cases.

The Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form, Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, and Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale were used to assess problematic gaming, social media use, and smartphone use. The Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 was used to assess distress, and an item rated on a 0-10 scale was included to assess fear of being infected by COVID-19. Fear of being infected by COVID-19 was assessed because this could be a confounding variable in the association between psychological distress and screen time use. Increased time spent on gaming, social media, and smartphones was associated with greater problematic gaming, problematic social media use, problematic smartphone use, and psychological distress, but was not associated with fear of COVID-19 infection. Mediation analyses showed that problematic gaming, problematic social media use, and problematic smartphone use were significant mediators in the association between psychological distress and increased time spent on Internet-related activities during the COVID-19 outbreak period. Children who had psychological distress during COVID-19 outbreak might have spent longer time on Internet-related activities due to the school hiatus and problematic use of Internet-related activities. Parents/caregivers are recommended to monitor their children's use of Internet while encouraging children to engage in positive activities to ease the concern of negative psychological responses during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Chao-Ying; Chen, I-Hua; Pakpour, Amir H; Lin, Chung-Ying; Griffiths, Mark D",Cyberpsychology behav. soc. netw.

We present a case of a middle-aged female with underlying non-alcoholic steatohepatitis associated cirrhosis who suffered a fatal pulmonary hemorrhage associated with COVID-19 infection. While the management of COVID-19 is evolving with regards to therapeutic anticoagulation requirements in critically ill patients, the impact of a pre-existing liver disease and its therapeutic implications when associated with COVID-19 is yet to be thoroughly elucidated. Case Report: Our patient is a 47 year old female with a past medical history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, fibromyalgia, non-decompensated NASH cirrhosis Child-Pugh Class C, gastric bypass surgery who developed progressive shortness of breath secondary to a COVID-19 pneumonia requiring hospitalization. She then developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure that required mechanical ventilation for over two weeks. Dexamethasone and Convalescent plasma were given for treatment of COVID-19. Unfortunately, her respiratory status during her ICU stay, declined requiring interventions including neuromuscular blockers and proning for refractory hypoxemia. She concurrently developed acute kidney injury requiring continuous renal replacement therapy. Her hospital course was also complicated by septic shock requiring vasopressors secondary to candidemia, and she was initiated on antifungal therapy with fluconazole. During ongoing CRRT therapy, we encountered recurrent clotting events and with the presumed COVID related hypercoagulability, patient was initiated on anticoagulation with systemic unfractionated heparin protocol. On day 17, her respiratory status and shock had resolved. However, her clinical status deteriorated quickly with recurrent shock of presumed sepsis, requiring initiation of broad spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Over the course of these 24 hours, patient suffered a fatal pulmonary hemorrhage despite massive transfusion protocol and reversal with protamine sulfate. Conclusion: We presented a cirrhotic patient who died of massive pulmonary hemorrhage associated with COVID-19 infection. There is overall paucity in the literature and in our understanding of management of COVID-19 associated with liver disease. While the literature reports a higher incidence of venous thromboembolic disease in COVID-19 patients, there are several challenges encountered with initiation of anticoagulation in a cirrhotic patient with concurrent coagulopathy. There are however anecdotal reports of favorable outcomes reported in these patients with use of anticoagulation possibly secondary to their antifibrotic properties. Future studies are required to clarify the role of safe and effective anticoagulation, criteria to make this decision, and perhaps even the choice of anticoagulation in patients with underlying liver disease.","Haag, A.

When treatment is initiated before or simultaneously to infection, favipiravir has a strong dose effect, leading to reduction of infectious titers in lungs and clinical alleviation of the disease. Antiviral effect of favipiravir correlates with incorporation of a large number of mutations into viral genomes and decrease of viral infectivity. Antiviral efficacy is achieved with plasma drug exposure comparable with those previously found during human clinical trials. Notably, the highest dose of favipiravir tested is associated with signs of toxicity in animals. Thereby, pharmacokinetic and tolerance studies are required to determine whether similar effects can be safely achieved in humans.","Driouich, Jean-Sélim; Cochin, Maxime; Lingas, Guillaume; Moureau, Grégory; Touret, Franck; Petit, Paul-Rémi; Piorkowski, Géraldine; Barthélémy, Karine; Laprie, Caroline; Coutard, Bruno; Guedj, Jérémie; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Solas, Caroline; Nougairède, Antoine",Nat Commun,24,29

Many workers started to use new technologies at work, including social media applications. In this longitudinal study, we investigated the potential stress effects of social media communication (SMC) at work. Based on our integrative theoretical model, we expected that SMC at work would burden some workers, but those who were accustomed to SMC at work would be better off when the crisis started. We collected a nationally representative sample of Finnish workers before (N = 1,308) and during (N = 1,081) the COVID-19 crisis. Outcome measures included technostress and work exhaustion. Multilevel linear mixed-effects regression models investigated formal and informal SMC at work. Covariates included cyberbullying at work, social media usage, personality, occupational status, and sociodemographic factors. Results showed that formal SMC increased and predicted higher technostress. However, technostress and work exhaustion decreased among workers already accustomed to using SMC at work before the crisis. The results indicate a disparity in workers’ resilience during remote work and highlight a need for organizational level support.","Oksanen, Atte Oksa Reetta Savela Nina Mantere Eerik Savolainen Iina Kaakinen Markus",Computers in Human Behavior,24,15

STUDY DESIGN: The study associated common SDOH metrics from public data sources (county specific) with health plan enrollment data (including demographics, counties, and zip codes) and medical and pharmaceutical annual claims data. METHODS: Following correlation analyses to reduce variables, the contribution of each SDOH individually and by category to the health outcomes was evaluated. Separate matrices for age populations (under age 19, general population [all ages], and &#8805; 65 years) were created with assigned weights of influence for categories and the factors within each category. RESULTS: The contributions of the categories varied by population, confirming that different SDOH influence populations to varying degrees. This was reflected in each model. The largest contributor to cost for the general population and for the group 65 years and older was factors grouped as health outcomes (such as perceived health), at 43.5% contribution and 37.7% contribution, respectively. Yet for the population younger than 19 years, the largest contributor to cost was socioeconomic factors (such as unemployment rate), at 40.2%. The other performance measures also varied by population and the mix and weight of determinants. CONCLUSIONS: This study and the developed population-based matrices can provide a valuable framework for reporting the impact of SDOH on health care quality. The variation suggests the need for further research on how age groups react to the social environment.","Krause, Trudy Millard; Schaefer, Caroline; Highfield, Linda",Am J Manag Care,24,21

These disparities are in large measure the result of longstanding patterns of structural, interpersonal, and cultural racism in US society, which in aggregate represent an underpinning of systemic racism that permeates the long-term care system's organization, administration, regulations, and human services. Mechanisms underlying the role of systemic racism in producing the observed disparities are numerous. Long-term care is fundamentally tied to geography, thereby reflecting disparities associated with residential segregation. Additional foundational drivers include a fragmented payment system that advantages persons with financial resources, and reimbursement policies that systematically undervalue long-term care workers. Eliminating disparities in health outcomes in these settings will therefore require a comprehensive approach to eliminating the role of systemic racism in promoting racial disparities.","Sloane, Philip D; Yearby, Ruqaiijah; Konetzka, R Tamara; Li, Yue; Espinoza, Robert; Zimmerman, Sheryl",J Am Med Dir Assoc,24,16

These syndromes share overlapping clinical features, and importantly they are all associated with an increased risk of cancer. Patients with RTS have the highest specific risk of developing osteosarcoma compared to all other cancer predisposition syndromes; therefore, RTS serves as a relevant model to study the pathogenesis and molecular genetics of osteosarcoma. The ""tumor suppressor"" function of the RECQ helicases continues to be an area of active investigation.

Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptors blockers (ARB) has been shown to increase angiotensin converting enzyme 2 expression by up to 5-fold. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: These findings coupled with observations of the high prevalence and mortality among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with underlying cardiovascular disease have led to a speculation that ACEIs/ARBs may predispose to higher risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis of the association between prior use of ACEIs and ARBs and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or hospitalization due to COVID-19 disease. DATA SOURCES: We searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Scopus, and Medrxiv.org preprint server until June 18, 2020. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: Ten studies (6 cohorts and 4 case control) that enrolled a total of 23,892 patients and 853,369 controls were eligible for inclusion in our meta-analysis. One study was excluded from the analysis because of high risk of bias. Prior use of ACEIs was not associated with an increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 or hospitalization due to COVID-19 disease, odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval (0.91-1.05), I2 = 15%. Similarly, prior use of ARBs was not associated with an increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2, odds ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval (0.98-1.10), I2 = 0%. CONCLUSION: Cumulative evidence suggests that prior use of ACEIs or ARBs is not associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 or hospitalization due to COVID-19 disease. Our results provide a reassurance to the public not to discontinue prescribed ACEIs/ARBs because of fear of COVID-19.","Tleyjeh, Imad M; Bin Abdulhak, Aref A; Tlayjeh, Haytham; Al-Mallah, Mouaz H; Sohail, M Rizwan; Hassett, Leslie C; Siller-Matula, Jolanta M; Kashour, Tarek",Am. j. ther,24,23

However, immunoglobulins targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported to wane below the detectable level of serologic assays (which is not necessarily equivalent to the duration of protective immunity). We estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection from serology studies, accounting for expected levels of antibody acquisition (seroconversion) and waning (seroreversion), and apply this framework using data from New York City and Connecticut. METHODS: We estimated time from seroconversion to seroreversion and infection fatality ratio (IFR) using mortality data from March to October 2020 and population-level cross-sectional seroprevalence data from April to August 2020 in New York City and Connecticut. We then estimated the daily seroprevalence and cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The estimated average time from seroconversion to seroreversion was 3-4 months. The estimated IFR was 1.1% (95% credible interval, 1.0%, 1.2%) in New York City and 1.4% (1.1, 1.7%) in Connecticut. The estimated daily seroprevalence declined after a peak in the spring. The estimated cumulative incidence reached 26.8% (24.2%, 29.7%) at the end of September in New York City and 8.8% (7.1%, 11.3%) in Connecticut, higher than maximum seroprevalence measures (22.1% and 6.1%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is underestimated using cross-sectional serology data without adjustment for waning antibodies. Our approach can help quantify the magnitude of underestimation and adjust estimates for waning antibodies.","Shioda, Kayoko; Lau, Max S Y; Kraay, Alicia N M; Nelson, Kristin N; Siegler, Aaron J; Sullivan, Patrick S; Collins, Matthew H; Weitz, Joshua S; Lopman, Benjamin A",Epidemiology,24,16

To address this issue, existing methods leverage an external knowledge base to generate appropriate responses. In real-world scenario, the entity may not be included by the knowledge base or suffer from the precision of knowledge retrieval. To deal with this problem, instead of introducing knowledge base as the input, we force the model to learn a better semantic representation by predicting the information in the knowledge base, only based on the input context. Specifically, with the help of a knowledge base, we introduce two auxiliary training objectives: 1) Interpret Masked Word, which conjectures the meaning of the masked entity given the context; 2) Hypernym Generation, which predicts the hypernym of the entity based on the context. Experiment results on two dialogue corpus verify the effectiveness of our methods under both knowledge available and unavailable settings.","Cui, Leyang; Wu, Yu; Liu, Shujie; Zhang, Yue",,24,14

Proper management of an increasing number of home-quarantined individuals created a significant challenge for health care authorities and professionals. This was especially true when considering the importance of remote surveillance to detect signs of disease progression and consequently regulate access to hospitals and intensive care units on a priority basis. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we report on an initiative promoted to cope with the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Spring/Summer of 2020, in the Autonomous Province of Trento, Italy. A purposefully built app named TreCovid19 was designed to provide dedicated health care staff with a ready-to-use tool for remotely monitoring patients with progressive symptoms of COVID-19, who were home-quarantined during the first wave of the epidemic, and to focus on those patients who, based on their self-reported clinical data, required a quick response from health care professionals. METHODS: TreCovid19 was rapidly developed to facilitate the monitoring of a selected number of home-quarantined patients with COVID-19 during the very first epidemic wave. The app was built on top of an existing eHealth platform, already in use by the local health authority to provide home care, with the following functionalities: (1) to securely collect and link demographic and clinical information related to the patients and (2) to provide a two-way communication between a multidisciplinary health care team and home-quarantined patients. The system supported patients to self-assess their condition and update the multidisciplinary team on their health status. The system was used between March and June 2020 in the province of Trento. RESULTS: A dedicated multidisciplinary group of health care professionals adopted the platform over a period of approximately 3 months (from March-end to June 2020) to monitor a total of 170 patients with confirmed COVID-19 during home quarantine. All patients used the system until the end of the initiative. The TreCovid19 system has provided useful insights of possible viability and impact of a technological-organizational asset to manage a potentially critical workload for the health care staff involved in the periodic monitoring of a relevant number of quarantined patients, notwithstanding its limitations given the rapid implementation of the whole initiative. CONCLUSIONS: The technological and organizational model adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic was developed and finalized in a relatively short period during the initial few weeks of the epidemic. The system successfully supported the health care staff involved in the periodic monitoring of an increasing number of home-quarantined patients and provided valuable data in terms of disease surveillance.","Gios, Lorenzo; Crema Falceri, Giulia; Micocci, Stefano; Patil, Luigi; Testa, Sara; Sforzin, Simona; Turra, Ettore; Conforti, Diego; Malfatti, Giulia; Moz, Monica; Nicolini, Andrea; Guarda, Paolo; Bacchiega, Alessandro; Mion, Carlo; Marchesoni, Michele; Maimone, Rosa; Molini, Pietro Benedetto; Zanella, Alberto; Osmani, Venet; Mayora-Ibarra, Oscar; Forti, Stefano",JMIR Form Res,24,1

METHODS: We established a COVID-19 biobank with the aim of collecting high-quality and well-annotated human biospecimens, in the effort to understand the pathogenic mechanisms underlying COVID-19 and identify therapeutic targets (COVID-BioB, NCT04318366). Here we describe our experience and briefly review the characteristics of the biobanks for COVID-19 that have been so far established. RESULTS: A total of 46,677 samples have been collected from 913 participants (63.3% males, median [IQR] age 62.2 [51.2 - 74.0] years) since the beginning of the program. Most patients (66.9%) had been admitted to hospital for COVID-19, with a median length of stay of 15.0 (9.0 - 27.0) days. A minority of patients (13.3% of the total) had been admitted for other reasons and subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The remainder were managed at home after being seen at the Emergency Department. CONCLUSIONS: Having a solid research infrastructure already in place, along with flexibility and adaptability to new requirements, allowed for the quick building of a COVID-19 biobank that will help expand and share the knowledge of SARS-CoV-2.","Rovere-Querini, Patrizia; Tresoldi, Cristina; Conte, Caterina; Ruggeri, Annalisa; Ghezzi, Silvia; De Lorenzo, Rebecca; Di Filippo, Luigi; Farina, Nicola; Ramirez, Giuseppe A; Ripa, Marco; Mancini, Nicasio; Cantarelli, Elisa; Galli, Laura; Poli, Andrea; De Cobelli, Francesco; Bonini, Chiara; Manfredi, Angelo A; Franchini, Stefano; Spessot, Marzia; Carlucci, Michele; Dagna, Lorenzo; Scarpellini, Paolo; Ambrosio, Alberto; Di Napoli, Davide; Bosi, Emanuele; Tresoldi, Moreno; Lazzarin, Adriano; Landoni, Giovanni; Martino, Gianvito; Zangrillo, Alberto; Poli, Guido; Castagna, Antonella; Vicenzi, Elisa; Clementi, Massimo; Ciceri, Fabio",Panminerva med,24,16

In this context, the sustained social efficacy of public health measures will depend more than ever on the level of acceptance across populations called on to temporarily sacrifice daily freedoms, while economic insecurity grows and social inequalities become more blatant. We seek to develop a framework for analysing how the requirements of 'social distancing' can be reconciled with the conditions that allow for the maintaining, or even strengthening, of social cohesion, mutual solidarity, and a sense of collective efficacy, throughout the crisis.

By means of a telephone survey of their directors, we observed that 16 nursing homes (94%) had no cases of COVID-19 among the residents, and that mortality from COVID-19 was very low compared to that recorded at the national level by Santé publique France (p<10-4). Moreover, the number of cases of Covid-19 among the staff of these nursing homes was also lower than that recorded by Santé publique France (p<10-4).

A common sentiment at the time was that Ebola served as a ""wake-up call""-an alarm which signalled that an outbreak of that magnitude should never have occurred and that we are ill-prepared globally to prevent and respond to them when they do. Pledges were made that we must learn from the outbreak before we were faced with another. Nearly five years later the world is in the grips of a pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is therefore of no surprise that we are now yet again hearing that the COVID-19 pandemic serves as the ""wake-up call"" we need and that there are many lessons to be learned to better prepare us for future outbreaks. Will anything be different this time around? We argue that nothing will fundamentally change unless we truly understand and appreciate the nature of the lessons we should learn from these outbreaks.

Materials and Methods: Trials were identified from the major electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library) using the key words ""HNSCC"" and ""SOX2."" The overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DPS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were the primary outcome measures. Results: We identified 371 articles, 9 articles 11 studies with a total number of 1334 cases were eligible for inclusion of this meta-analysis. The results showed that OS (DPS) in low-expression group was higher than that in high-expression group. However, the difference between the two groups was not significant (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = [0.88, 1.91]; P = 0.18), and there was great statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 66%, P = 0.002). After subgroup analysis, the HR for OS of the patients with reduced expression of SOX2 was 1.34 (95% CI = [1.04, 1.74], P = 0.03), and the heterogeneity became acceptable (I2 = 32%, P = 0.16). The HR for DFS of the patients with reduced expression of SOX2 was 1.39 (95% CI = [1.00, 1.93]; P = 0.05). Conclusion: The findings of this meta-analysis are indicative of that high SOX2 expression is a negative prognostic factor of HNSCC and exhibit both worse OS and DFS. However, the small sample size available for this systematic review limited the power of this quantitative meta-analysis. It may therefore be too early to place complete confidence in these results.","Li, Bo; Chen, Mei; Pan, Meng-Xiong",J Cancer Res Ther,24,3

Due to increased sensitivity, mass spectrometry has become the predominant method in modern glycomics. Here, we summarize recent studies showing that the improved resolution and detection by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has contributed greatly to the discovery of a large range of anionic and zwitterionic N-glycan structures across the different kingdoms of life, whereby MALDI-TOF MS in negative mode is less widely performed than in positive mode. However, its use enables the detection of key fragments indicative of certain sugar modifications such as sulfate, (methyl) phosphate, phosphoethanolamine, (methyl)aminoethylphosphonate, glucuronic, and sialic acid, thereby enabling certain isobaric glycan variations to be distinguished. As we also discuss in this review, complementary approaches such as negative-mode electrospray ionization-MS/MS, Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance MS, and ion mobility MS yield, respectively, cross-linkage fragments, high accuracy masses, and isomeric information, thus adding other components to complete the jigsaw puzzle when defining unusual glycan modifications from lower organisms.","Hykollari, Alba; Paschinger, Katharina; Wilson, Iain B H",Mass spectrom. rev,24,18

MATERIALS: We evaluated trends in patient encounters and laboratory testing for DM in a pediatric healthcare system from March to September 2019 and during the same period in 2020. RESULTS: Evaluation of 17,367 patient encounters illustrated that the pandemic was associated with significantly fewer in-person office visits and point-of-care HbA1c tests for patients with DM in 2020 relative to 2019. A separate analysis of 7,193 HbA1c results measured by point-of-care testing in the general population found a significant increase in the number of measured HbA1c >14 % in May 2020 relative to 2019, but other measured HbA1c values did not differ. As a means to address lapses in the monitoring of HbA1c due to the pandemic, we evaluated the use of the dried blood spot (DBS) matrix for measurement of HbA1c by the Vitros 5600 chemistry analyzer. DBS HbA1c was well correlated to whole blood (r=0.9889) and exhibited intra- and inter-assay precision from 0.5-3.5%.

METHOD: In March and April 2020, 776 adults from Canada and the U.S. ages 18-91 (mean age 45) reported COVID-19 threats at baseline, then completed nightly surveys for one week about their daily stressors, positive events, and affect. RESULTS: Younger age predicted more concerns about the threat of COVID-19 across multiple domains, in addition to lower positive affect, higher negative affect, and less frequent positive events. Younger adults had more non-COVID-19 daily stressors and higher perceived control over stressors, but lower perceived coping efficacy than older adults. There were no age differences in the frequency of COVID-19 daily stressors nor perceived stressor severity. Younger adults had greater reductions in negative affect on days when more positive events occurred and greater increases in negative affect on days when non-COVID-19 stressors occurred. Age moderation was attenuated for negative affective reactivity to COVID-19 stressors. Age did not moderate positive affective reactivity to daily events. DISCUSSION: In the early weeks of the pandemic, older adults showed better emotional well-being and less reactivity to stressors but did not differ from younger adults in their exposure to COVID-19 stressors. Additionally, younger adults benefited more from positive events.","Klaiber, Patrick; Wen, Jin H; DeLongis, Anita; Sin, Nancy L",,24,1

This is a retrospective, multicentre cohort study, based on data from 46 285 hospitalisations for COVID-19 in Brazil. Survival functions were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier's method. The log-rank test compared the survival functions for each variable and from that, hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated, and the proportional hazard model was used in Cox multiple regression. The smallest survival curves were the ones for patients at the age of 68 years or more, black/mixed race, illiterate, living in the countryside, dyspnoea, respiratory distress, influenza-like outbreak, O2 saturation <95%, X-ray change, length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), invasive ventilatory support, previous heart disease, pneumopathy, diabetes, Down's syndrome, neurological disease and kidney disease. Better survival was observed in the influenza-like outbreak and in an asthmatic patient. The multiple model for increased risk of death when they were admitted to the ICU HR 1.28, diabetes HR 1.17, neurological disease HR 1.34, kidney disease HR 1.11, heart disease HR 1.14, black or mixed race of HR 1.50, asthma HR 0.71 and pneumopathy HR 1.12.

Handwashing is a key component of guidance to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior systematic reviews have indicated the effectiveness of handwashing to reduce transmission of respiratory viruses. In low-income countries, reduction of transmission is of paramount importance, but social distancing is challenged by high population densities and access to handwashing facilities with soap and water is limited. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to estimate global access to handwashing with soap and water to inform use of handwashing in the prevention of COVID-19 transmission. METHODS: We utilized observational surveys and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression modeling in the context of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study to estimate access to a handwashing station with available soap and water for 1,062 locations from 1990 to 2019. RESULTS: Despite overall improvements from 1990 {33.6% [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 31.5, 35.6] without access} to 2019, globally in 2019, 2.02 (95% UI: 1.91, 2.14) billion people, 26.1% (95% UI: 24.7, 27.7) of the global population, lacked access to handwashing with available soap and water. More than 50% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania were without access to handwashing in 2019, and in eight countries, 50 million or more persons lacked access. DISCUSSION: For populations without handwashing access, immediate improvements in access or alternative strategies are urgently needed, and disparities in handwashing access should be incorporated into COVID-19 forecasting models when applied to low-income countries. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7200.","Brauer, Michael; Zhao, Jeff T; Bennitt, Fiona B; Stanaway, Jeffrey D",Environ Health Perspect,24,20

Several immune cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, eosinophils, as well as T and B lymphocytes, synthetize and release cytokines involved in the inflammatory process. Gender differences in the incidence and severity of inflammatory lung ailments including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis (PF), lung cancer (LC), and infectious related illnesses have been reported. Moreover, the effects of sex hormones on both androgens and estrogens, such as testosterone (TES) and 17ß-estradiol (E2), driving characteristic inflammatory patterns in those lung inflammatory diseases have been investigated. In general, androgens seem to display anti-inflammatory actions, whereas estrogens produce pro-inflammatory effects. For instance, androgens regulate negatively inflammation in asthma by targeting type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and T-helper (Th)-2 cells to attenuate interleukin (IL)-17A-mediated responses and leukotriene (LT) biosynthesis pathway. Estrogens may promote neutrophilic inflammation in subjects with asthma and COPD. Moreover, the activation of estrogen receptors might induce tumorigenesis. In this chapter, we summarize the most recent advances in the functional roles and associated signaling pathways of inflammatory cellular responses in asthma, COPD, PF, LC, and newly occurring COVID-19 disease. We also meticulously deliberate the influence of sex steroids on the development and progress of these common and severe lung diseases.","Reyes-García, Jorge; Montaño, Luis M; Carbajal-García, Abril; Wang, Yong-Xiao",Adv Exp Med Biol,24,16

Because the viruses are expelled mainly attached to small droplets, with diverse sizes and weights, and the external environmental conditions can also be diverse, the subsequent motion spannes different spatial and temporal scales. For droplet sizes larger than $100\,\mu m$, computing the time of decay to the ground and the distance travelled with a simple free fall model with empirical data extracted from the literature, we obtain distances in the range between $1$ to $3$ meters from the emitter, with a falling time of less than $1\,s$, similar to known recommendations for safe social distancing. For droplets sizes less than $100\,\mu m$ a simple model of motion in a viscous medium predicts that isolated viruses could remain suspended in quiet air for more than a month, while small droplets of $1\,\mu m$ in size can remain suspended for several hours, in agreement with recent experimental results on virus stability in aerosols. These results give solid background for the discussion of prevention strategies, like the use of masks in closed environments.","Stariolo, Daniel A.",,24,1

We first formulate a mathematical model for the dynamic transmission of COVID-19 that takes into account the circulation of free coronaviruses in the environment. We provide the basic properties of the model and compute the basic reproduction number R 0that plays an important role in the outcome of the disease. After, assuming continuous measurement of newly COVID-19 reported cases, deceased and recovered individuals, the EnKf approach is used to estimate the unmeasured variables and unknown COVID-19 transmission rates using real data of the current COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon. We present the forecasts of the current pandemic in Cameroon and explore the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as mass media-based sensitization, social distancing, face-mask wearing, contact tracing and the desinfection and decontamination of infected places by using suitable products against free coronaviruses in the environment in order to reduce the spread of the disease. Through numerical simulations, we find that at that time (i) R 0≈2.9495 meaning that the disease will not die out without any control measures, (ii) the infection from COVID-19 infected cases is more important than the infection from free coronaviruses in the environment, (iii) the number of new COVID-19 cases will still increase and there is a necessity to increase timely the surveillance by using contact tracing and sensibilisation of the population to respect social distancing, face-masks wearing through awareness programs and (iv) the eradication of the pandemic is highly dependent on the control measures taken by governments.","Nkwayep, C.

This relationship could be caused by Galectin-3-mediated increased immune response and increased viral attachment. Keeping PDs under control and maintaining rigorous oral hygiene during this troubled Covid-19 pandemic period is very important.Patients with older age and pre-existing conditions like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity are in the higher risk group for developing severe Covid-19 infections. The inflammatory pathways that are involved in these conditions are the same pathways that we see in periodontal diseases (PDs). This raises a significant question: Is PD a pre-existing condition that can increase the risk of developing severe Covid-19 infection? Several studies have shown that Galectins play a key role in the homeostasis of immune cells, and recently, a relationship was found between Covid-19 and Galectin-3 (Gal-3).It has been determined that an important area in the spike protein of Coronavirus-19 is almost exactly the same as the morphology of Gal-3, and these spike proteins are critical for the entry of the virus into host cells. We suspect that there is enough evidence to support a close relationship between PDs severity and Covid-19 infections. There is accumulating evidence to suggest a relationship between the severity of PD and the risk of infection with Covid-19, which requires further investigation. This relationship could be caused by Gal-3-mediated increased immune response and increased viral attachment. In this context, we want to emphasize the importance of keeping PD under control by maintaining rigorous oral hygiene during this troubled Covid-19 pandemic period. We would also like to point out the possibility that having PD may be a pre-disposition toward developing a severe Covid-19 infection.","Kara, Cankat; Çelen, Kübra; Dede, Figen Öngöz; Gökmenoglu, Ceren; Kara, Nihal Beldüz",Exp Biol Med (Maywood),24,26

DESIGN: A 21-day diary study was conducted between late March and late April 2020 in Germany. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hypotheses were tested in a sample of 561 participants (Mage = 42.79, SDage = 6.12). Every evening, participants indicated their exposure to COVID-19-related media (e.g., TV, print, online) and their COVID-19-related worries. RESULTS: Same-day analyses showed that participants reported more COVID-19-related worries on days with higher exposure to COVID-19-related media. Dynamical structural equation models provided evidence for a reciprocal cycle across days: Higher media exposure at one day predicted higher worries the next day, and higher worries at one day also predicted higher media exposure the next day. Individuals with high trait anxiety reported an enhanced general level of media exposure during the 21 days of assessment, and individuals high in neuroticism and anxiety reported an enhanced level of worries. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a self-reinforcing cycle whereby consuming crisis-related media and worrying reciprocally influence each other across days, possibly amplifying adverse effects of the COVID-19 crisis and other crises alike on mental and physical health.","Schmidt, Andrea; Brose, Annette; Kramer, Andrea C; Schmiedek, Florian; Witthöft, Michael; Neubauer, Andreas B",Psychol Health,24,22

The immuno-pathology of this disease is neither clearly understood nor there are effective drugs for severe cases of COVID-19. Repurposing of available drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 is imperative.Areas Covered: This review has gathered the evidence from PubMed, Google Scholar, WHO, and other reliable websites on COVID-19 and summarized the existing knowledge of the immuno-pathology of COVID-19. We elucidated how vitamin D through its diverse actions on immune effector cells, epithelial cells, or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system could have a modulatory role on the pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19. The epidemiological evidence associating vitamin D deficiency with the severity and incidence of COVID-19 is also presented. However, the evidence of clinical benefit to patients of COVID-19 from randomized controlled trials with vitamin D has not come as yet.Expert opinion: It is now established that fatality of COVID-19 is primarily determined by hyperactivation of the host's innate immune system in response to SARS-CoV-2 invasion, and thus the research on the immuno-modulatory and other roles of vitamin D against viral infections should be pursued vigorously. This would be also useful for future pandemics caused by other novel viruses.","Banerjee, Anindita; Ganguly, Upasana; Saha, Sarama; Chakrabarti, Suddhachitta; Saini, Reena V; Rawal, Ravindra K; Saso, Luciano; Chakrabarti, Sasanka",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,24,22

METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 16 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and 58 COVID-19 negative patients at a medical center in Taiwan over a 3-month period. Serial serum samples were collected and tested for antibody response using four point-of-care (POC) lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) (ALLTEST 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test, Dynamiker 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test, ASK COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test, and Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test). Time-dependent detection sensitivity and timeliness of seroconversion were determined and compared between the four POC rapid tests. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity and specificity of the four tests for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after 3 weeks of symptom onset were 100% and 100%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the rapid tests used for detection of IgM and IgG separately and those used for detection of combined total antibody (mainly IgM/IgG). There was no significant difference between the four POC rapid tests in terms of time required for determining seroconversion of COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 with pneumonia demonstrated shorter seroconversion time than those without pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Though the POC antibody rapid tests based on LFIA showed reliable performance in the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, the results of these tests should be interpreted and applied appropriately in the context of antibody dynamic of COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 patients complicated with pneumonia exhibited earlier anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response than COVID-19 patients without pneumonia.","Wu, Jhong-Lin; Tseng, Wen-Pin; Lin, Chien-Hao; Lee, Tai-Fen; Chung, Ming-Yi; Huang, Chien-Hua; Chen, Shey-Ying; Hsueh, Po-Ren; Chen, Shyr-Chyr",J Infect,24,8

Mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients, including 19 cases of nucleic acid false-negative patients and 31 cases of nucleic acid positive patients, were enrolled. Their epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory examination data and imaging characteristics were analyzed. Risk factors for false negatives were discussed. Compared with the nucleic acid positive group, the false-negative group had less epidemiological exposure (52.6% vs 83.9%; P = .025), less chest discomfort (5.3% vs 32.3%; P = .035), and faster recovery (10 [8, 13] vs 15 [11, 18.5] days; P = .005). The number of involved lung lobes was (2 [1, 2.5] vs 3 [2, 4] days; P = .004), and the lung damage severity score was (3 [2.5, 4.5] vs 5 [4, 9] days; P = .007), which was lighter in the nucleic acid false-negative group. Thus, the absence of epidemiological exposure may be a potential risk factor for false-negative nucleic acids. The false-negative cases of COVID-19 are worth noting because they have a risk of viral transmission without positive test results, lighter clinical manifestations, and less history of epidemiological exposure.","Rong, Yan; Wang, Fei; Liu, Jing; Zhou, Yang; Li, Xiaoli; Liang, Xinhua; Zhang, Dandan; Zeng, Huadong; Wang, Jing; Shi, Yi",J. med. virol,24,1

With the recognition that universal health coverage improves the health of a population and reduces health inequalities, universal health coverage has been acknowledged as a priority goal. To meet the global needs in a population with increased chronic illness and longer life expectancy, the health care system is in dire need of new, emerging technologies. eHealth solutions as a method of delivery may have an impact on quality of care and health care costs. As such, it is important to study methods previously used to avoid suboptimal implementation and promote general guidelines to further develop eHealth solutions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore and thematically categorize a selected representation of early phase studies on eHealth technologies, focusing on papers that are under development or undergoing testing. Further, we want to assess enablers and barriers in terms of usability, scaling, and data management of eHealth implementation. The aim of this study to explore early development phase and feasibility studies was an intentional effort to provide applicable guidelines for evaluation at different stages of implementation. METHODS: A structured search was performed in PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane to identify and provide insight in current eHealth technology and methodology under development and gain insight in the future potential of eHealth technologies. RESULTS: In total, 27 articles were included in this review. The clinical studies were categorized thematically by illness comparing 4 technology types deemed relevant: apps/web-based technology, sensor technology, virtual reality, and television. All eHealth assessment and implementation studies were categorized by their focus point: usability, scaling, or data management. Studies assessing the effect of eHealth were divided into feasibility studies, qualitative studies, and heuristic assessments. Studies focusing on usability (16/27) mainly addressed user involvement and learning curve in the adoption of eHealth, while the majority of scaling studies (6/27) focused on strategic and organizational aspects of upscaling eHealth solutions. Studies focusing on data management (5/27) addressed data processing and data sensitivity in adoption and diffusion of eHealth. Efficient processing of data in a secure manner, as well as user involvement and feedback, both throughout small studies and during upscaling, were the important enablers considered for successful implementation of eHealth. CONCLUSIONS: eHealth interventions have considerable potential to improve lifestyle changes and adherence to treatment recommendations. To promote efficient implementation and scaling, user involvement to promote user-friendliness, secure and adaptable data management, and strategical considerations needs to be addressed early in the development process. eHealth should be assessed during its development into health services. The wide variation in interventions and methodology makes comparison of the results challenging and calls for standardization of methods.","Stome, L. N.; Wilhelmsen, C. R.; Kvaerner, K.

METHODS: We administered an anonymous, voluntary, web-based survey to a convenience sample of trainees worldwide. The survey was distributed by email and social media posts from April 20th to May 11th, 2020. Respondents were asked to estimate the number of patients with COVID-19 they cared for in March and April 2020 (0, 1-30, 31-60, >60). Survey questions addressed (1) safety and access to personal protective equipment (PPE), (2) training and professional development and (3) well-being and burnout. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 1420 trainees (73% residents, 27% fellows), most commonly from the USA (n=670), China (n=150), Saudi Arabia (n=76) and Taiwan (n=75). Trainees who cared for a greater number of patients with COVID-19 were more likely to report limited access to PPE and COVID-19 testing and more likely to test positive for COVID-19. Compared with trainees who did not take care of patients with COVID-19 , those who took care of 1-30 patients (adjusted OR [AOR] 1.80, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.51), 31-60 patients (AOR 3.30, 95% CI 1.86 to 5.88) and >60 patients (AOR 4.03, 95% CI 2.12 to 7.63) were increasingly more likely to report burnout.

At issue is an ongoing contest over who gets to rule, and how. But this time, the forces of the status quo comprised of the military, monarchy, judiciary, bureaucracy, and ""yellow-shirt"" columns no longer face the political party machine of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and its ""red-shirt"" supporters based in rural heartlands. Instead, a broad-based and organic youth movement on a myriad of campuses in high schools and universities across the country are challenging the established centers of power to reform and modernize. At issue is whether a compromise emerges as the dust of conflict thickens. Military coups more than parliamentary solutions determined past outcomes after unworkable tension and turmoil. But this time, a putsch under a new reign may not succeed in clearing the slate for a reset. Thailand is facing an uncharted and precarious frontier. Navigating out of this quagmire requires mutual respect and understanding. The youth movement will need to broaden and appeal to other segments of society and older demographics to reinforce their grievances and demands, pressing for concessions and reforms of traditional institutions rather than upending them. Notwithstanding lip service and foot-dragging on a constitutional overhaul, the incumbent regime and entrenched institutions of the old order must realize that only concessions and compromises can ensure some of their privileges and prerogatives will be maintained.","Pongsudhirak, Thitinan",The SAIS Review of International Affairs,24,14

METHODS: This is a single center, retrospective study conducted at Policlinico di Monza hospital, located in the Lombardy region, Northern Italy. We reviewed medical records of 373 consecutive adult patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 between February 22 and May 15, 2020. Data were collected on diabetes status, comorbid conditions and laboratory findings. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate the effect of diabetes on in-hospital mortality after adjustment for potential confounding variables. RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 72 ± 14 years (range 17-98), 244 (65.4%) were male and 69 (18.5%) had diabetes. The most common comorbid conditions were hypertension (237 [64.8%]), cardiovascular disease (140 [37.7%]) and malignant neoplasms (50 [13.6%]). In-hospital death occurred in 142 (38.0%) patients.

METHODS: Eligible Saudi women routinely using oral anticonceptive pills were invited to participate in this prospective, cross-sectional survey. Data were collected using a standardized, pretested, semi-structured questionnaire. Jazan was selected as it recorded the highest number of women using contraceptives in Saudi Arabia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The pattern of pill utilization, attitude toward pill use, and incidence of side effects. RESULTS: A total of 496 women consented to participate in this study. Most of the respondents (87.5%) were using or had used oral anticonceptives for birth control. In nearly half (49.2%) of participants, oral pills were advised by a gynaecologist, and approximately two-thirds (69.0%) were using or had used combined oral anticonceptives. Nearly two-thirds (63.1%) of respondents preferred pills over other contraception methods due to their ease of use. More than one-third (39.3%) of participants agreed that oral pills are safe. Approximately half (53.2%) of participants were aware that a missed pill must be taken immediately after recalling that a dose was missed. A total of 69.6% of participants experienced at least one side effect, of which mood swings (61.1%), weight gain or increase appetite (42.2%), decreased libido (34.1%), and nausea (31.2%) were most common. CONCLUSION: Saudi women had a high acceptance rate for oral anticonceptives as a legitimate method to prevent unintended pregnancy. This was associated with a modest degree of understanding about their risks and benefits. Pharmacists should provide up-to-date information and counsel patients about the use and side effects of oral anticonceptives.","Yasmeen, Ayesha; Syed, Mamoon H; Meraya, Abdulkarim M; Albarraq, Ahmed A; Makeen, Hafiz A; Alqahtani, Saad S; Abubaker, Mawada; Syed, Nabeel Kashaan A",Int. j. clin. pharm,24,1

Here we reported the mental health status of Chinese residents as well as the community's prevention and control during the pandemic period of COVID-19 and further explored the influencing factors of mental status. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, convenience sampling and snowball sampling methods were adopted from February 16 to February 23, 2020, and Chinese community residents were included according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three questionnaires, including General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), and a self-designed ""Community prevention and control questionnaire"", were used. A multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to analyze the impact factors of anxiety and depression. Results: A total of 3,001 community residents were included in this study. In total, 85.6% and 83.7% of participants had minimal anxiety and depression, respectively. Among all the community residents, 16.6% of participants proved that the communities they lived in had confirmed cases. 95.3% of participants reported that the residents were screened for mobility and contact history. 97.8% of participants reported the entrance and exit of the community were managed in their communities. There were 97.5% and 99% of participants needed to take body temperature and wear masks in their communities. Ninety-two percent (92%) of communities have their public areas and facilities disinfected daily, and 95.4% of communities have conducted health education about COVID-19. Factors including gender, education level, chronic illness, the frequency of going out, achieving information about COVID-19 by community and newspaper, and confirmed cases in the community, show association with community residents' anxiety and depression. Conclusions: The vast majority of Chinese residents have little anxiety and depression, and most communities have adopted standardized control measures following the government's regulations and policy, which plays a vital role in the control of COVID-19 and improving residents' anxiety and depression.","Li, Simin; Ye, Zhiyu; Du, Chunping; Wei, Quan; He, Chengqi",Ann Transl Med,24,10

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in a pandemic hospital in Istanbul, Turkey, which included 681 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19. Data on characteristics, vital signs, and laboratory parameters were recorded from electronic medical records. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to quantify the discriminatory abilities of the prognostic scales. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify other predictors of mortality. RESULTS: Higher CRP levels were associated with an increased risk for mortality (OR: 1.015, 95% CI: 1.008-1.021; p < 0.001). The PSI performed significantly better than CURB-65 (AUC: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.88-0.93 vs AUC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.85-0.90; p = 0.01), and the addition of CRP levels to PSI did not improve the performance of PSI in predicting mortality (AUC: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.88-0.93 vs AUC: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.89-0.94; p = 0.29). CONCLUSION: In a large group of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, we found that PSI performed better than CURB-65 in predicting mortality.

This study assesses the prevalence and incidence of burnout symptoms and moral distress in ICU professionals before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis. DESIGN: This is a longitudinal open cohort study. SETTING: Five ICUs based in a single university medical center plus another adult ICU based on a separate teaching hospital in the Netherlands. SUBJECTS: All ICU professionals were sent a baseline survey in October-December 2019 (252 respondents, response rate: 53%), and a follow-up survey was sent in May-June 2020 (233 respondents, response rate: 50%). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Burnout symptoms and moral distress measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory and the Moral Distress Scale, respectively. The prevalence of burnout symptoms was 23.0% before coronavirus disease 2019 and 36.1% at postpeak time, with higher rates in nurses (38.0%) than in physicians (28.6%). Reversely, the incidence rate of new burnout cases among physicians was higher (26.7%) than nurses (21.9%). Higher prevalence of burnout symptoms was observed in the postpeak coronavirus disease 2019 period (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.32-2.53), for nurses (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.03-3.04), for professionals working overtime (odds ratio 2.11; 95% CI, 1.48-3.02), and for professionals directly engaged with care for coronavirus disease 2019 patients (odds ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.35-2.60). Physicians were more likely than nurses to develop burnout symptoms due to coronavirus disease 2019 (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.06-12.21). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that overburdening of ICU professionals during an extended period of time leads to symptoms of burnout. Working long hours and under conditions of scarcity of staff, time, and resources comes at the price of ICU professionals' mental health.","Kok, Niek; van Gurp, Jelle; Teerenstra, Steven; van der Hoeven, Hans; Fuchs, Malaika; Hoedemaekers, Cornelia; Zegers, Marieke",Crit Care Med,24,1

Many people have migrated to the state from different countries as well as other states during this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The aim of this study was to analyse the receptor-binding domain (RBD) sequence of the spike protein from isolates collected from throat swab samples of COVID-19-positive patients and further to assess the RBD affinity for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of different species, including humans. METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing for 35 clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates from COVID-19-positive patients was performed by ARTIC amplicon-based sequencing. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis were performed for the spike region and the RBD region of all isolates. The interaction between the RBD and ACE2 of five different species was also analysed. RESULTS: The spike region of 32 isolates showed one or multiple alterations in nucleotide bases in comparison with the Wuhan reference strain. One of the identified mutations, at position 1204 (Ref A, RMRC 22 C), in the RBD coding region of the spike protein showed stronger binding affinity for human ACE2. Furthermore, RBDs of all the Indian isolates showed binding affinity for ACE2 of different species. CONCLUSION: As mutant RBD showed stronger interaction with human ACE2, it could potentially result in higher infectivity. The binding affinity of the RBDs for ACE2 of all five species studied suggests that the virus can infect a wide variety of animals, which could also act as natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-2.","Dash, Pujarini; Turuk, Jyotirmayee; Behera, Santosh K; Palo, Subrata Kumar; Raghav, Sunil K; Ghosh, Arup; Sabat, Jyotsnamayee; Rath, Sonalika; Subhadra, Subhra; Rana, Khokan; Bhattacharya, Debdutta; Kanungo, Srikanta; Kshatri, Jaya Singh; Mishra, Bijaya Kumar; Dash, Saroj; Parida, Ajay; Pati, Sanghamitra",Int J Infect Dis,24,1

Currently available instruments may not be sensitive to the concerns about COVID-19 in postacute and long-term care and their applications in telehealth remain to be clarified. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the psychometric properties of the Mood-5 Scale (M5) as a rapid self-assessment of the COVID-19 psychological burden among postacute and long-term care residents. METHODS: Residents (N=131), aged 50 years and above, from 20 postacute and long-term care facilities in Maryland, USA, were evaluated in-person or via telehealth (43/131, 32.8%) across a 4-week period (May 11 to June 5, 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 psychological burden experienced by the residents was rated by geriatric psychologists who independently reviewed their clinical documentation. Psychometric analyses were performed on the M5 in relation to psychological tests, COVID-19 psychological burden, and diagnostic data collected during the evaluation. RESULTS: The M5 demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach &#945;=.77). M5 scores were not confounded by demographic variables or telehealth administration (P>.08). Convergent validity for the M5 was established via positive associations with anxiety (r=0.56, P<.001) and depressive (r=0.49, P<.001) symptoms. An M5 cutoff score of 3 demonstrated strong sensitivity (0.92) and adequate specificity (0.75) for identifying COVID-19 psychological distress among postacute and long-term care residents (area under the curve of 0.89, positive predictive value=0.79, negative predictive value=0.91). CONCLUSIONS: The M5 is a reliable and valid tool for self-assessment of mood that can help identify postacute and long-term care residents with significant psychological burden associated with COVID-19. It can be completed in less than 1 minute and is appropriate for use in both in-person and virtual visits.","Mansbach, William E; Mace, Ryan A; Tanner, Melissa A",JMIR Aging,24,16

Among them, ocular infections caused by herpesviruses are the most frequent. HSV-1 keratitis and kerato-uveitis affect approximately are the leading cause of infectious blindness in the Western world, mainly because of corneal opacification caused by recurrences. For this reason, they may warrant long-term antiviral prophylaxis. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus, accounts for 10 to 20% of all shingles locations and can be associated with severe ocular involvement (keratitis, kerato-uveitis) of which a quarter becomes chronic/recurrent. Post herpetic neuralgias in the trigeminal territory can be particularly debilitating. Necrotizing retinitis caused by herpesviruses (HSV, VZV, CMV) are seldom, but must be considered as absolute visual emergencies, requiring urgent intravenous and intravitreal antiviral treatment. Clinical pictures depend on the immune status of the host. Adenovirus are the most frequent cause of infectious conjunctivitis. These most often benign infections are highly contagious and may be complicated by visually disabling corneal lesions that may last over months or years. Some arboviruses may be associated with inflammatory ocular manifestations. Among them, congenital Zika infections may cause macular or optic atrophy. Conjunctivitis is frequent during the acute phase of Ebola virus disease. Up to 15% of survivors present with severe chronic inflammatory ocular conditions caused by viral persistence in uveal tissues. Finally, COVID-19-associated conjunctivitis can precede systemic disease, or even be the unique manifestation of the disease.

A 15-item questionnaire was distributed to the patients with 3 additional questions to be answered by the treating neurosurgeon. RESULTS: A total of 437 questionnaires were analyzed. Overall anxiety to visit a general practitioner or the outpatient facility within the hospital was very low among patients. A quarter of all appointments had to be postponed due to COVID-19, in 0.6% postponement was perceived as incorrect by the treating neurosurgeon. We noted that 43% did not get an appointment due to the restrictions, 20% did not want to bother the medical system, and only 4% were afraid to get infected in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Despite COVID-19, patients in need of neurosurgical service were hardly afraid to visit doctors and/or hospitals. Nonetheless, because legal requirements, access has been restricted, causing potential collateral damage in a small subset of neurosurgical patients.","Pinggera, Daniel; Kerschbaumer, Johannes; Grassner, Lukas; Demetz, Matthias; Hartmann, Sebastian; Thomé, Claudius",World neurosurgery (Online),24,16

Given that, it is important for the Emergency Physician to remember that a SARS-CoV-2 associated respiratory failure can be caused not only by the pulmonary parenchymal inflammation that characterizes the pneumonia, but also by an associated pulmonary thromboembolism. Case report: A healthy 73-years old woman admitted to the ED for dyspnea, fever and thoracic pain. Cardiac ultrasound, electrocardiogram and clinical findings suggested a diagnosis of cardiogenic obstructive shock due to acute pulmonary embolism, successfully treated with thrombolysis. A CT angiography confirmed the pulmonary embolism (EP) diagnosis and showed bilateral pneumonia, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion: Considering the high prevalence of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients it is mandatory for the emergency physician to systematically evaluate signs of pulmonary thromboembolism, in order to perform the most patient-tailored therapy as soon as possible.","Colombo, L.; Macheda, A.; Gentile, D.; Panizzardi, F.; Pierini, S.; Codazzi, C.; Meloni, L.; Bianchi, F.; Santangelo, G.",Respir.

The objective of this study was to determine whether the morphology of PTFJ has predictive value for the risk of total knee replacement (TKR). Case knees from Osteoarthritis Initiative participants with TKR at 24-60 months follow up (cases) were 1:1 matched with control knees (no TKR throughout 60 months) by baseline age, sex, and Kellgren-Lawrence grade. PTFJ morphological parameters, including coronal inclination angle (angle &#945;), sagittal inclination angle (angle ß), fibular contacting area (S), load-bearing area (S&#964;), lateral stress-bolstering area (S&#966;), and posterior stress-bolstering area (S&#965;) were assessed using coronal and sagittal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), respectively. Associations of the morphological measures at baseline and the time point before TKR (T0 ) and their changes with TKR risks were examined using conditional logistic regression analyses. Two hundred and twenty-three knees of 193 participants received TKR between 12 and 60 months and therefore were matched with 223 control knees. Of these, 173 paired knees had MRI readings available both at baseline and T0 time point. While baseline angle &#945; was positively associated with TKR risk, other measures at baseline and all measures at T0 were not significantly associated with TKR risk. Changes in S, S&#964;, and S&#965; were significantly and negatively associated with the risk of TKR (&#916;S, odds ratio [OR] = 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.19-0.76; &#916;S&#964;, OR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.16-0.87; &#916;S&#965;, OR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.08-0.62, respectively).

An older age, diabetes and history of cardiovascular disease, especially hypertension, but also chronic heart failure and coronary artery disease among others, are between the most important risk factors. In addition, during the hospitalization both hyperglycaemia and heart failure are frequent. Less frequent are acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias and stroke. Accordingly, not all prolonged stays or even deaths are due directly to SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, this is the first review, focusing both on cardiovascular and metabolic aspects of this dreadful disease, in an integrated and personalized way, following the guidelines of the Cardiometabolic Health/Medicine. Therefore, current personalized aspects such as ACEIs and ARBs, the place of statins and the most appropriate management of heart failure in diabetics are analysed. Aging, better than old age, as a dynamic process, is also considered in this review for the first time in the literature, and not only as a risk factor attributed to cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular comorbidities. Immunosenescence is also approached to build healthier elders, so they can resist present and future infectious diseases, and not only in epidemics or pandemics. In addition, to do this we must start knowing the molecular mechanisms that underlying Aging process in general, and immunosenescence in particular. Surprisingly, the endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy are implicated in both process. Finally, with a training in all the aspects covered in this review, not only the hospital stay, complications and costs of this frightening disease in high-risk population should be reduced.

The main goal was to evaluate the prognostic role of quantitative assessment of the extent of lung damage for early mortality of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in cancer patients. Methods: We prospectively included consecutive cancer patients with recent onset of COVID-19 pneumonia assessed by chest CT between March 15, 2020, and April 20, 2020, and followed until May 1, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory test data and imaging findings were recorded. Quantitative chest CT assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia was based on the density distribution of lung lesions using a freely available software recently released (Myrian XP-Lung). The association between extent of lung damage and overall survival was studied by univariate and multivariate Cox analysis. The Uno C-index was used to assess the discriminatory value of the quantitative CT extent of lung damage. Results: Seventy cancer patients with chest CT evidence of COVID-19 were included. After a median follow-up of 25 days, 17 patients (24%) had died. The median quantitative chest CT extent of COVID-19 was 20% (IQR = 14–35, range = 3–59) for non-survivors vs. 10% (IQR = 6–15, range = 2–55) for survivors (p = 0.002). The extent of COVID-19 pneumonia was correlated with inpatient management (p = 0.003) and oxygen therapy requirements (p &lt; 0.001). Independent factors associated with death were performance status (PS) ≥2 (HR = 3.9, 95% CI = [1.1–13.8] p = 0.04) and extent of COVID-19 pneumonia ≥30% (HR = 12.0, 95% CI = [2.2–64.4] p = 0.004). No differences were found regarding the histology of cancer, cancer stage, metastases sites, or type of oncologic treatment between the survivor and non-survivor groups. The cross-validated Uno C-index of the model including PS and extent of COVID-19 pneumonia was 0.83, 95% CI = [0.73–0.93].

Methods: Computed tomography scans of 95 adult patients who underwent a polymerase chain reaction test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were analyzed. Clinical data were obtained from patients' records and telephone calls. Paranasal sinus opacification was graded and compared according to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positivity. Results: Of the patients 28 (29.5%) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (median age 52 [range 26-95] years) and 67 were negative (median age 50 [range 18-95] years). Mucosal thickening was present in 97.4% of maxillary sinuses, 80% of anterior ethmoid air cells, 75.3% of posterior ethmoid air cells, 74.7% of frontal sinuses, and 66.3% of sphenoid sinuses. Minimal or mild mucosal thickening (score 1)and normally aerated sinuses (score 0) corresponded to 71.4% and 21.3% of all paranasal sinuses, respectively. The mean score of each paranasal sinus among severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive and negative patients was 0.85±0.27 and 0.87±0.38, respectively (p=0.74). Median paranasal sinus opacification score among severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive patients was 9 (interquartile range 8-10) compared to 9 (interquartile range 5-10) in negative patients (p=0.89).

Vulnerability of a geographical region/country to COVID-19 has been a topic of interest, particularly in low- and middle-income countries like India to assess the multi-factorial impact of COVID-19 on the incidence, prevalence or mortality data. Datasets and MethodsBased on publicly reported socio-economic, demographic, health-based and epidemiological data from national surveys in India, we compute contextual, COVID-19 Vulnerability Indices (cVIs) across multiple thematic resolutions for different geographical and spatial administrative regions. These multi-resolution cVIs were used in regression models to assess their impact on indicators of the spread of COVID-19 such as the average time-varying instantaneous reproduction number. ResultsOur observational study was focused on 30 districts of the eastern Indian state of Odisha. It is an agrarian state, prone to natural disasters and one of the largest contributors of an unprotected migrant workforce. Our analyses identified housing and hygiene conditions, availability of health care and COVID preparedness as important spatial indicators. ConclusionOdisha has demonstrated success in containing the COVID-19 infection to a reasonable level with proactive measures to contain the spread of the virus during the first wave. However, with the onset of the second wave of COVID, the virus has been making inroads into the hinterlands and peripheral districts of the state, burdening the already deficient public health system in these areas. The vulnerability index presented in this paper identified vulnerable districts in Odisha. While some of them may not have a large number of COVID-19 cases at a given point of time, they could experience repercussions of the pandemic. Improved understanding of the factors driving COVID-19 vulnerability will help policy makers prioritise resources and regions leading to more effective mitigation strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. O_TEXTBOXWHAT IS ALREADY KNOWNMeasuring vulnerability to COVID-19 and other pandemics is a complex and layered subject. In Low-to-Middle-Income Country (LMIC) like India, complete reliance on incidence, prevalence or mortality data of the disease may not be the best measure since this data from the health system and DHS in public domain is limited. ADDED VALUE OF THIS STUDYTo our knowledge, this is the first study at the district level concerning the COVID-19 situation in Odisha, characterized by a large tribal and migrant population. We defined vulnerability through relevant socio-economic domains that have an influence on mitigation strategies. Although we applied our methods to the districts of Odisha, we believe they can be used in other LMIC regions. IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGSRegions with higher overall or theme-specific vulnerability index might experience potentially severe consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak demanding precise, dynamic and nimble policy decisions to prevent a potentially dire situation.

Further, we aimed to explore the differences in the psychological response and psychopathology in terms of demographics. We developed a COVID-19 Psychological Response Questionnaire (CPRQ). Further, we estimated the factor structure and internal consistency of CPRQ. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was utilized to assess Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) was utilized to assess Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The sample comprised 7015 participants whose ages ranged between 18 and 70 years. The present study results yielded a 5-factor model of psychological response to COVID-19 (the factors are Anxiousness, Social Support, Avoiding/Cleaning, Depressivity, and Medical Concern). In terms of reliability, the internal consistency of the above factors was acceptable except for Depressivity. There were significant positive correlations between two factors (Anxiousness and Depressivity) and both MDD and GAD. In terms of demographic characteristics, females had the highest values on Anxiousness, Avoiding/Cleaning, Depressivity, MDD, and GAD. Generally, the 5-factor model reflects the psychological response to COVID-19 during the period of the outbreak. Further, this model reflects several concepts regarding models and theories of health-related behaviors.

The secondary objective was to evaluate the percentage of patients treated with DRV/c who were exposed to potentially severe drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and died during hospitalization. This observational retrospective study was conducted in consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Modena, Italy. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to compare patients receiving standard of care with or without DRV/c. Adjustment for key confounders was applied. Two hundred seventy-three patients (115 on DRV/c) were included, 75.8% males, mean age was 64.6 (±13.2) years. Clinical improvement was similar between the groups, depicted by respiratory aid switch (p > .05). The same was observed for duration of hospital stay [13.2 (±8.9) for DRV/c vs. 13.4 (±7.2) days for no-DRV/c, p = .9]. Patients on DRV/c had higher rates of mortality (25.2% vs. 10.1%, p < .0001. The rate of composite outcome of mechanical ventilation and death was higher in the DRV/c group (37.4% vs. 25.3%, p = .03). Multiple serious DDI associated with DRV/c were observed in the 19 patients who died. DRV/c should not be recommended as a treatment option for COVID-19 pneumonia outside clinical trials.","Milic, Jovana; Novella, Alessio; Meschiari, Marianna; Menozzi, Marianna; Santoro, Antonella; Bedini, Andrea; Cuomo, Gianluca; Franceschini, Erica; Digaetano, Margherita; Carli, Federica; Ciusa, Giacomo; Volpi, Sara; Bacca, Erica; Franceschi, Giacomo; Yaacoub, Dina; Rogati, Carlotta; Tutone, Marco; Burastero, Giulia; Faltoni, Matteo; Iadisernia, Vittorio; Dolci, Giovanni; Cossarizza, Andrea; Mussini, Cristina; Pasina, Luca; Guaraldi, Giovanni",AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,24,10

METHODS: Retrospective case report. SD-OCT, fluorescein angiography and OCT angiography were performed. RESULTS: A 21-year-old healthy man described the acute onset of superior visual field loss in his right eye. He admitted smoking approximately 15 grams daily of cannabis for several weeks during COVID-19 confinement. Ophthalmoscopic examination of the right eye showed inferotemporal retinal whitening. SD-OCT illustrated evidence of the ischemic cascade with diffuse hyperreflectivity of the inner and middle retinal layers within the central region of the retinal infarct and paracentral acute middle maculopathy at the border of the infarct. Optical coherence tomography angiography demonstrated predominant flow signal loss at the level of the deep retinal capillary plexus.

Although it has been suggested that these drugs might lead to a higher susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 infection, experimental data suggest these agents may reduce acute lung injury via blocking angiotensin-II-mediated pulmonary permeability, inflammation and fibrosis. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to answer the question: What is the effect of medications that influence ACE2 expression (ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and thiazolidinediones) on the outcomes of COVID-19? Relevant outcome measures were mortality (crucial), hospital admission, length of stay, thromboembolic complications (pulmonary embolism, stroke, transient ischaemic attack), need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury and use of renal replacement therapy. Medline and Embase databases were searched with relevant search terms until 24 June 2020. After systematic analysis, nine studies were included. RESULTS: The results were described for two different groups, an overall group in which all users were compared with non-users and a group in which only hypertensive patients were included. Within each group a distinction was made between results for ACEI/ARB use, ACEI use, ARB use, NSAID use and thiazolidinedione use. None of the studies demonstrated increased mortality in the two groups. Furthermore, none of the studies showed an effect on other outcome measures in COVID-19, such as ICU admission, length of hospital stay, thromboembolic complications, need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney failure or need for renal replacement therapy. However, the level of evidence of all studies varied from 'moderate' to 'very low', according to the GRADE methodology. CONCLUSION: Analysis of the literature demonstrated that there was insufficient evidence to answer our objective on the effect of ACE2 expression mediating pharmacotherapy on outcome in COVID-19 patients, especially due to the low scientific quality of the described studies. Randomised controlled studies are needed to answer this question.","van Kimmenade, R R J; Belfroid, E; Hoogervorst-Schilp, J; Siebelink, H J; Janssen, C W; Pinto, Y",Neth Heart J,24,23

RESULTS: Among our respondents, 36.4% reported clinically significant levels of depression, 22.7% for generalized anxiety, and 10.3% for PTSD. Women with pre-existing mental health diagnoses based on their self-reported history were 1.6-to-3.7 more likely to score at clinically significant levels of depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD. Approximately 18% reported high levels of COVID-19-related health worries and were 2.6-to-4.2 times more likely to score above the clinical threshold for mental health symptoms. Approximately 9% reported high levels of grief and were 4.8-to-5.5 times more likely to score above the clinical threshold for mental health symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Perinatal women with pre-existing mental health diagnoses show elevated symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Pediatric practices are the primary point of contact regarding questions about risk factors, symptoms and suspicion of illness. The lockdown could have a severe impact on overall number of consultancies, preventive medical check-ups and vaccinations. Objective: The impact of COVID-19-related lockdowns in Saarland regarding patient care in the ambulatory pediatric setting and general consultation, early preventive consultancy as well as specialized medical care. Material and methods: All 53 pediatric practices in Saarland were asked to report their case numbers for calendar weeks 2-26 in 2019 and 2020. These data were analyzed via descriptive statistics. Results: Data from 34 (64%) of Saarland's pediatric practices were evaluated. There was a decline of -37% regarding overall cases during lockdown, -9.4% of early diagnosis cases and -35% regarding specialized medical consultancy (4 specialized practices). After lockdown the overall case numbers were significantly reduced with -17.1% in comparison to 2019, the early diagnosis cases caught up nearly completely with +9.4% and also the specialized care showed catch-up effects with +7%. Conclusion: Lockdown-related collateral damage regarding preventive performances/activities could be avoided in the ambulatory pediatric setting in Saarland. Cancelled/postponed activities caught up during the observation period.During the observation period, the overall case numbers remained lower than 2019. The reason could be the contribution of SARS-CoV­2 prevention measures to significantly reduce other respiratory infections.","Theiß, Karsten; Simon, Arne; Graf, Norbert; Rohrer, Tilman",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,24,19

How ophthalmologists evaluate their risk of infection and whether they are willing to be vaccinated has not been investigated so far. The aim of this project was to assess the subjective rating of the risk of infection and the willingness to be vaccinated among German ophthalmologists. METHODS: Data were collected by an anonymous online survey conducted by the Professional Association of Ophthalmologists in Germany (BVA) and the German Ophthalmological Society (DOG) under the auspices of the University Eye Hospital Düsseldorf. The questionnaire was open for participation from 22 January to 12 February 2021. The survey was addressed to all colleagues in ophthalmology. RESULTS: A total of 1162 completed questionnaires were analyzed. On average, survey respondents rated their risk of infection as 7.5â¯± 1.9 (scale of 1-10; 1â¯= very low risk, 10â¯= very high risk). Of the respondents 971 (83.6%) rated their risk of infection as higher compared to other disciplines and 92.9% (nâ¯= 1079) indicated they would be willing to be vaccinated. CONCLUSION: The ophthalmologists interviewed consider their professional group to be exposed to an above-average risk of SARS-COV­2 infection compared to other disciplines. They frequently criticized the prioritization ranking of the German Ministry of Health (BMG), which deviated from the suggestions of the Standing Vaccination Committee of Germany (STIKO).

In its general form, autophagy governs cellular lifecycle through the formation of double membrane vesicles, termed autophagosomes, that enwrap and deliver unwanted intracellular components to lysosomes. In addition to this omniscient role, forms of selective autophagy, relying on specialized receptors for cargo recognition, exert fine-tuned control over cellular homeostasis. In this regard, xenophagy plays a pivotal role in restricting the replication of intracellular pathogens, thus acting as an ancient innate defense system against infections. Recently, selective autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), more simply ER-phagy, has been uncovered as a critical mechanism governing ER network shape and function. Six ER-resident proteins have been characterized as ER-phagy receptors and their orchestrated function enables ER homeostasis and turnover overtime. Unfortunately, ER is also the preferred site for viral replication and several viruses hijack ER machinery for their needs. Thus, it is not surprising that some ER-phagy receptors can act to counteract viral replication and minimize the spread of infection throughout the organism. On the other hand, evolutionary pressure has armed pathogens with strategies to evade and subvert xenophagy and ER-phagy. Although ER-phagy biology is still in its infancy, the present review aims to summarize recent ER-phagy literature, with a special focus on its role in counteracting viral infections. Moreover, we aim to offer some hints for future targeted approaches to counteract host-pathogen interactions by modulating xenophagy and ER-phagy pathways.","Reggio, Alessio; Buonomo, Viviana; Grumati, Paolo",Exp Cell Res,24,1

Heart-brain interactions are complex and multifaceted and appear to be bidirectional. Exposure to chronic and daily stressors such as quarantine, or severe psychological trauma like a significant person in danger of life can affect the cardiovascular system and the emotional experience of the individual, leading to an increased risk of developing a cardiovascular disease or mental illness. Subjects with comorbidities between mental disorders and heart diseases are obviously more susceptible to be influenced by emotional burden due to the spread of COVID-19, with emotional responses characterized by fear, panic, anger, frustration. Psychological services and crisis interventions are needed at an early stage to reduce anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder in such a stressful period, with a special attention to special groups of patients, such as women, children, or the elderly.","Mazza, M.; Marano, G.; Antonazzo, B.; Cavarretta, E.; M, D.

We aimed to a priori identify specific patient profiles and then assess their association with the outcomes in COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms admitted specifically to hospital wards. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-center study from February 2020 to April 2020. A non-supervised cluster analysis was first used to detect patient profiles based on characteristics at admission of 220 consecutive patients admitted to our institution. Then, we assessed the prognostic value using Cox regression analyses to predict survival. RESULTS: Three clusters were identified, with 47 patients in cluster 1, 87 in cluster 2, and 86 in cluster 3; the presentation of the patients differed among the clusters. Cluster 1 mostly included sexagenarian patients with active malignancies who were admitted early after the onset of COVID-19. Cluster 2 included the oldest patients, who were generally overweight and had hypertension and renal insufficiency, while cluster 3 included the youngest patients, who had gastrointestinal symptoms and delayed admission. Sixty-day survival rates were 74.3%, 50.6% and 96.5% in clusters 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This was confirmed by the multivariable Cox analyses that showed the prognostic value of these patterns. CONCLUSION: The cluster approach seems appropriate and pragmatic for the early identification of patient profiles that could help physicians segregate patients according to their prognosis.","Bondeelle, Louise; Chevret, Sylvie; Cassonnet, Stéphane; Harel, Stéphanie; Denis, Blandine; de Castro, Nathalie; Bergeron, Anne",PLoS One,24,16

The weighted overall prevalence was 1.6% and monthly prevalence correlated with viral RNA-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in Greece, in the same period. Notably, 49% of seropositive cases reported no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related clinical symptoms and 33% were unsuspected of their previous infection. Additionally, levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the spike-protein receptor-binding domain were similar between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, irrespective of age and gender. Using Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization-approved assays, these results support the need for such studies on pandemic evaluation and highlight the development of robust humoral immune responses even among asymptomatic individuals. The high percentage of unsuspected/asymptomatic active cases, which may contribute to community transmission for more days than that of cases who are aware and self-isolate, underscores the necessity of measures across the population for the efficient control of the pandemic.","Tsitsilonis, Ourania E; Paraskevis, Dimitrios; Lianidou, Evi; Terpos, Evangelos; Akalestos, Athanasios; Pierros, Vassilios; Kostaki, Evangelia Georgia; Kastritis, Efstathios; Moutsatsou, Paraskevi; Politou, Marianna; Scorilas, Andreas; Sphicopoulos, Thomas; Thomaidis, Nikolaos; Trougakos, Ioannis P; Tsakris, Athanassios; Voulgaris, Nikolaos; Daskalaki, Christina C; Evangelakou, Zoi; Fouki, Christina; Gianniou, Despoina D; Gumeni, Sentiljana; Kostopoulos, Ioannis V; Manola, Maria S; Orologas-Stavrou, Nikolaos; Panteli, Chrysanthi; Papanagnou, Eleni-Dimitra; Rousakis, Pantelis; Sklirou, Aimilia D; Smilkou, Stavroula; Stergiopoulou, Dimitra; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Dimopoulos, Meletios-Athanasios; Sfikakis, Petros P",,24,5

LID - 40",16.682373,7.6447253,2020,"BACKGROUND: Reverse transcription of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (+)RNA genome and subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) and subsequent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the reliable diagnostic gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis and the identification of potential spreaders. Apart from clinical relevance and containment, for specific questions, it might be of interest to (re)investigate cases with low SARS-CoV-2 load, where RT-qPCR alone can deliver conflicting results, even though these cases might neither be clinically relevant nor significant for containment measures, because they might probably not be infectious. In order to expand the diagnostic bandwidth for non-routine questions, particularly for the reliable discrimination between negative and false-negative specimens associated with high CT values, we combined the RT-qPCR workflow with subsequent pyrosequencing of a S-gene amplicon. This expansion can help to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infections without the demand of confirmative antibody testing, which requires to summon patients again for blood sampling few to several weeks after symptom onset. RESULTS: We successfully established a combined RT-qPCR and S-gene pyrosequencing method which can be optionally exploited after routine diagnostics. This allows a reliable interpretation of RT-qPCR results in specimens with relatively low viral loads and close to the detection limits of qPCR. After laboratory implementation, we tested the combined method in a large pediatric cohort from two German medical centers (n=769). Pyrosequencing after RT-qPCR enabled us to uncover 5 previously unrecognized cases of pediatric SARS-CoV-2-associated diseases, mainly exhibiting mild and heterogeneous presentation-apart from a single case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2, who was hospitalized in the course of the study. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed protocol allows a specific and sensitive confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infections close to the detection limits of RT-qPCR. The tested biotinylated primers do not negatively affect the RT-qPCR pipeline and thus can be optionally applied to enable deeper inspection of RT-qPCR results by subsequent pyrosequencing. Moreover, due to the incremental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, we note that the used strategy can uncover (Spike) P681H allowing the pre-selection of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 candidate specimens for deep sequencing.","Weil, Patrick Philipp; Hentschel, Jacqueline; Schult, Frank; Pembaur, Anton; Ghebremedhin, Beniam; Mboma, Olivier; Heusch, Andreas; Reuter, Anna-Christin; Müller, Daniel; Wirth, Stefan; Aydin, Malik; Jenke, Andreas C W; Postberg, Jan",Mol Cell Pediatr,24,16

Eukaryotic cells are equipped with highly conserved stress-response mechanisms that support cellular function when homeostasis is compromised, promoting survival. Two such mechanisms - the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy - are involved in the cellular response to perturbations in the endoplasmic reticulum, in calcium homeostasis, in cellular energy or redox status. Each of them operates through conserved signaling pathways to promote cellular adaptations that include re-programming transcription of genes and translation of new proteins and degradation of cellular components. In addition to their specific functions, it is becoming increasingly clear that these pathways intersect in many ways in different contexts of cellular stress. Viral infections are a major cause of cellular stress as many cellular functions are coopted to support viral replication. Both UPR and autophagy are induced upon infection with many different viruses with varying outcomes - in some instances controlling infection while in others supporting viral replication and infection. The role of UPR and autophagy in response to coronavirus infection has been a matter of debate in the last decade. It has been suggested that CoV exploit components of autophagy machinery and UPR to generate double-membrane vesicles where it establishes its replicative niche and to control the balance between cell death and survival during infection. Even though the molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated, it is clear that UPR and autophagy are intimately associated during CoV infections. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought renewed interest to this topic as several drugs known to modulate autophagy - including chloroquine, niclosamide, valinomycin, and spermine - were proposed as therapeutic options. Their efficacy is still debatable, highlighting the need to better understand the molecular interactions between CoV, UPR and autophagy.","Prestes, Elisa B; Bruno, Julia C P; Travassos, Leonardo H; Carneiro, Leticia A M",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,24,6

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can cause liver injury through systemic inflammatory response syndrome, cytokine storms, ischemia-reperfusion injury, side effects of treatment drugs, and underlying liver disease and can attack liver cells directly via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Clinical studies have found that liver injury in COVID-19 patients mainly manifests as abnormal liver biochemical indicators, but there have been no reports of liver failure caused by this disease. The number of COVID-19 patients with liver injury is increasing, and the incidence of liver injury in COVID-19 patients with severe disease are higher than in patients with mild disease. Liver injury may be a risk factor, which worsens in patients with COVID-19, and hence it is necessary to pay attention to the occurrence of liver injury in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.","Tian, Dandan; Ye, Qing",J. med. virol,24,12

Cell stress is an established mechanism known to be associated with infection and cancer. Different proteins crucial for cellular response to stress are reported to be a possible target to stop the infection and to reduce the chemo-resistance in cancer. Heat shock protein (HSP) families of chaperones play an essential role in cells both in normal state and under stress. The upregulation of HSP5A, also termed GRP78 or Bip, is reported in different viral infections.

METHODS: According to the official data released by the National Health Commission, the epidemic data of infected people from 0:00 on January 24, 2020 to 24:00 on February 23, 2020 were quantitatively analyzed through statistical analysis. We used EXCEL software to draw the overall epidemic trend chart and Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) to carry out descriptive statistical analysis of mortality and cure rate. We made qualitative analysis on the emergency measures implemented by national administrative departments and provincial governments to work on controlling and monitoring COVID-19 nationwide spread. RESULTS: The number of patients diagnosed showed a linear increasing trend, with the slope increasing first and decreasing later. Suspected and new cases showed an inverted V pattern, with the peak occurring on February 8 and 12, respectively. There was a linear increase in the number of deaths and an exponential increase in the number of cures. Over the 31-day study period, the mortality rate fluctuated between 2.0% and 3.4%. The mean cure rate was 10.03%, the minimum value was 1.33%, and the maximum value was 32.05%. The quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that the public health emergency response system constructed in China plays a significant role in controlling the epidemic in a certain period of time. DISCUSSION: The four-tier emergency management system and the joint prevention mechanism established in China have provided various resources to control the epidemic, but there are still weakness in dealing with the spread of COVID-19. It is suggested to improve and strengthen the emergency management system, public health service system, health legal system, citizen health education, and international exchange and cooperation.","Xu, Tingting; Yang, Ruoyu",J Epidemiol Glob Health,24,1

METHOD: Nationally representative longitudinal data from Germany were taken from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (wave 5 to wave 7; n = 10,446 observations in the analytical sample). Using the three item loneliness scale (UCLA), loneliness was measured. According to the WHO thresholds, obesity was defined as BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2. Asymmetric fixed effects (FE) regressions were used. RESULTS: Conventional FE regression analysis revealed that changes in obesity status were associated with changes in loneliness (men: ß = -.19, p < .05; women: ß = .19, p < .05). Asymmetric FE regressions showed that in men the onset of obesity was associated with a decrease in loneliness (ß = -.31, p < .05), whereas the end of obesity was not associated with loneliness. Asymmetric FE regressions showed that in women, the onset of obesity was associated with an increase in loneliness (ß = .33, p < .01), whereas the end of obesity was not associated with loneliness. CONCLUSION: Findings showed that the onset of obesity has different consequences in terms of loneliness for older women and men in Germany, whereas the end of obesity was not associated with changes in loneliness scores. We recommend that future studies should distinguish between the onset and the end of obesity - which comes along with important practical implications. When older women report transitions to obesity, efforts to prevent loneliness may be of importance.","Hajek, André; König, Hans-Helmut",Aging Ment Health,24,32

A considerable number of complications after anastomosis of the colon and rectum can be noticed and the colonic obstruction has been as one of the main factors. OBJECTIVE: Study the anastomotic healing in the colon of rats after intestinal obstruction. METHODS: The animals (n=39) were divided in: Group I (submitted to intestinal obstruction induced four days before of the anastomoses, n=22) and Group II (Controls, n=22). The colonic anastomosis were made by a standardized technique and, seven days later, the segments which them were reviewed, resected and analyzed for a hydroxyproline dosage. RESULTS: The complications were more usual in the animals with obstruction (11 rats: 50%) than in the controls (3 rats: 17,7%), p 0,05. The median value of hydroxyproline was higher in the Group I (975,0 x 872,0), p>0,05. CONCLUSION: The anastomosis in the rat's colon with intestinal obstruction is related to more complications. This can be explained by the following factor's: more technical difficulty in the preparation of the anastomosis caused by different diameter of the bowel, higher undernourishment, proximal faecal retention, bacterial translocation and ischaemia. The statistical similarity between the groups regarding to the dosage of hydroxyproline suggests that the healing of the rats' colonic anastomosis with intestinal obstruction, in the absence of complications, follows the same process of collagen synthesis as the controls ones.","MT, Bezuti; Féres, Omar; Dorival Campos, Antonio; Aprilli, Francisco; Joaquim Ribeiro da Rocha, José; dos Santos Garcia, Ricardo; Fernandes Duarte Joviliano, Orcina",Acta cir. bras.,24,20

Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating targeted therapies to hinder this exaggerated inflammatory response. Critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have shown heterogeneous severity trajectories, suggesting that response to therapies is likely to vary across patients. RESEARCH QUESTION: Are critically ill COVID-19 patients biologically and immunologically dissociable based on profiling of currently evaluated therapeutic targets? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We did a single-center, prospective study in an ICU department in France. Ninety-six critically ill adult patients admitted with a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. We conducted principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering on a vast array of immunologic variables measured on the day of ICU admission. RESULTS: We found that patients were distributed in three clusters bearing distinct immunologic features and associated with different ICU outcomes. Cluster 1 had a ""humoral immunodeficiency"" phenotype with predominant B-lymphocyte defect, relative hypogammaglobulinemia, and moderate inflammation. Cluster 2 had a ""hyperinflammatory"" phenotype, with high cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-1ß, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNFâº]) associated with CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte defects. Cluster 3 had a ""complement-dependent"" phenotype with terminal complement activation markers (elevated C3 and sC5b-9). INTERPRETATION: Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibiting cytokine release marks, complement activation, or B-lymphocyte defects are distinct from each other. Such immunologic variability argues in favor of targeting different mediators in different groups of patients and could serve as a basis for patient identification and clinical trial eligibility.","Dupont, Thibault; Caillat-Zucman, Sophie; Fremeaux-Bacchi, Véronique; Morin, Florence; Lengliné, Etienne; Darmon, Michael; Peffault de Latour, Régis; Zafrani, Lara; Azoulay, Elie; Dumas, Guillaume",Chest,24,3

METHODS: Children with a positive result of nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) underwent laboratory tests, anal and conjunctival swab, electrocardiography, lung, abdomen, and cardiac ultrasound. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed if abnormal basal blood pressure. Patients were followed-up for 6 months. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixteen children were evaluated; 15 were finally included. Confirmed family member SARS-CoV-2 infection was present in all. Twenty-seven percent were asymptomatic. Anal and conjunctival swabs tests resulted negative in all. Patients with lower body mass index (BMI) presented significantly higher viral loads. Main laboratory abnormalities were: lactate dehydrogenase increasing (73%), low vitamin D levels (87%), hematuria (33%), proteinuria (26%), renal hyperfiltration (33%), and hypofiltration (13%). Two of the patients with hyperfiltration exhibited high blood pressure levels at diagnosis, and persistence of prehypertension at 6-month follow-up. No abnormalities were seen at ultrasound, excepting for one patient who exhibited B-lines at lung sonography. Immunoglobulin G seroconversion was observed in all at 1-month. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirm that intra-family transmission is important. The significant higher viral loads recorded among patients with lower BMI, together with low vitamin D levels, support the impact of nutritional status on immune system. Renal involvement is frequent even among children with mild COVID-19, therefore prompt evaluation and identification of patients with reduced renal function reserve would allow a better stratification and management of patients. Seroconversion occurs also in asymptomatic children, with no differences in antibodies titer according to age, sex and clinical manifestations.","Isoldi, Sara; Mallardo, Saverio; Marcellino, Alessia; Bloise, Silvia; Dilillo, Anna; Iorfida, Donatella; Testa, Alessia; Del Giudice, Emanuela; Martucci, Vanessa; Sanseviero, Mariateresa; Barberi, Antonio; Raponi, Massimo; Ventriglia, Flavia; Lubrano, Riccardo",J Med Virol,24,25

METHODS: Retrospective study of patients operated on in the previous month and during the peak of the pandemic. We analysed the COVID-19 infection rate, the severity of respiratory infection according to the Brescia respiratory COVID-19 severity scale, the adopted therapeutic measures and the overall postoperative complications. RESULTS: From 17th February to 31st March 2020, there was a progressive decrease in surgical activity, with only 213 patients operated on. This comprised 59 (27.8%) elective operations for oncological diseases, 97 (45.5%) elective operations for benign diseases and 57 (26.7%) as urgent procedures. There was a progressive increase in the rate of infection by COVID-19, with a total of 15 cases (7%). This included 10 patients (16.9%) in the elective group for oncological disease, 1 (1%) in the elective surgery group for benign disease and 4 (7%) in the urgent surgery group (P<.001). Five patients presented with a severe respiratory infection, of which 4 were affected by oncological disease. There were 3 deaths (1.4%), which were all due to the worsening of a respiratory infection. CONCLUSIONS: The patients undergoing the surgical procedures showed high rates of COVID-19 infection and postoperative complications, especially the patients with oncological diseases. Local resumption of surgical activity must be based on the prioritisation of the cases to be operated on, respecting certain premises of security and optimisation of the available resources.","Di Martino, Marcello; García Septiem, Javier; Maqueda González, Rocío; Muñoz de Nova, Jose Luis; de la Hoz Rodríguez, Ángela; Correa Bonito, Alba; Martín-Pérez, Elena",Cir.

It stands out from the other families, as it depends on two baseline distributions, with the use of ratio and power transforms in the definition of the main cumulative distribution function. Thanks to the joint action of the possibly different baseline distributions, flexible statistical models can be created, motivating a complete study in this regard. Thus, we discuss the theoretical properties of the new family, with emphasis on those of potential interest to the overall probability and statistics. Then, a new three-parameter lifetime distribution is derived, with the choices of the inverse exponential and exponential distributions as baselines. After pointing out the great flexibility of the related model, we apply it to analyze an actual dataset of current interest: the daily COVID-19 cases observed in Pakistan from 21 March to 29 May 2020 (inclusive). As notable results, we demonstrate that the proposed model is the best among the 15 top ranked models in the literature, including the inverse exponential and exponential models, several modern extensions of them depending on more parameters, and the ""unexponentiated"" version of the proposed model as well. As future perspectives, the proposed model can be of interest to analyze data on COVID-19 cases in other countries, for possible comparison studies.","Bantan, Rashad A.

Only the first isolate per species from each patient was included. Hospital wards and intensive care units (ICUs) were analysed separately.ResultsDuring the study, the RIF of Acinetobacter baumannii increased in wards, as did the proportion of A. baumannii isolates, which were non-susceptibleto most antibiotics in both wards and ICUs. Coincidently, Klebsiella pneumoniae RIF declined while the respective rates of non-susceptible isolates to carbapenems and gentamicin increased. Pseudomonas aeruginosa RIF remained stable but decreasing proportions of non-susceptible isolates to all studied antibiotics, except imipenem were observed. Escherichia coli RIF increased as did the proportion of isolates non-susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones. Concerning Staphylococcus aureus, a decline in the percentage of meticillin resistant isolates in ICUs was found, while the percentages of Enterococcus faecium isolates with non-susceptibility to vancomycin stayed stable.ConclusionsRecognising these trends over time is important, since the epidemiology of AMR is complex, involving different 'bug and drug' combinations.

In contrast, other countries e.g. North American and European governments are typically silent on these practices, unless to warn of possible harm and overselling. Such difference is due to the discrepancy in culture, history and philosophical views of health care and medication, as well as unharmonized policies and standards in the regulation and legalization of TM/HMs among different areas.

Recent computational studies have reported that withanone and withaferin A, phytochemicals found in Withania somnifera, target viral main protease (MPro) and host transmembrane TMPRSS2, and glucose related protein 78 (GRP78), respectively, implicating their potential as viral entry inhibitors. Absence of specific treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection has encouraged exploration of phytochemicals as potential antivirals. Aim: This study aimed at in silico exploration, along with in vitro and in vivo validation of antiviral efficacy of the phytochemical withanone. Methods: Through molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation and electrostatic energy calculation the plausible biochemical interactions between withanone and the ACE2-RBD complex were investigated. These in silico observations were biochemically validated by ELISA-based assays. Withanone-enriched extract from W. somnifera was tested for its ability to ameliorate clinically relevant pathological features, modelled in humanized zebrafish through SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike (S) protein induction. Results: Withanone bound efficiently at the interacting interface of the ACE2-RBD complex and destabilized it energetically. The electrostatic component of binding free energies of the complex was significantly decreased. The two intrachain salt bridge interactions (K31-E35) and the interchain long-range ion-pair (K31-E484), at the ACE2-RBD interface were completely abolished by withanone, in the 50 ns simulation. In vitro binding assay experimentally validated that withanone efficiently inhibited (IC50=0.33 ng/mL) the interaction between ACE2 and RBD, in a dose-dependent manner. A withanone-enriched extract, without any co-extracted withaferin A, was prepared from W. somnifera leaves. This enriched extract was found to be efficient in ameliorating human-like pathological responses induced in humanized zebrafish by SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike (S) protein. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study provided experimental validation for computational insight into the potential of withanone as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus entry into the host cells.","Balkrishna, Acharya; Pokhrel, Subarna; Singh, Hoshiyar; Joshi, Monali; Mulay, Vallabh Prakash; Haldar, Swati; Varshney, Anurag",Drug Des Devel Ther,24,6

Commonly used projection matrix based approaches for point forecast reconciliation are OLS (ordinary least squares), WLS (weighted least squares), and MinT (minimum trace). Even though point forecast reconciliation is a well-established field of research, the literature on generating probabilistic forecasts subject to linear constraints is somewhat limited. Available methods follow a two-step procedure. Firstly, it draws future sample paths from the univariate models fitted to each series in the collection (which are incoherent). Secondly, it uses a projection matrix based approach or empirical copula based reordering approach to account for contemporaneous correlations and linear constraints. The projection matrices are estimated either by optimizing a scoring rule such as energy or variogram score, or simply using a projection matrix derived for point forecast reconciliation. This paper proves that (a) if the incoherent predictive distribution is Gaussian then MinT minimizes the logarithmic scoring rule; and (b) the logarithmic score of MinT for each marginal predictive density is smaller than that of OLS. We show these theoretical results using a set of simulation studies. We also evaluate them using the Australian domestic tourism data set.","Wickramasuriya, Shanika L",,24,1

To prevent outbreaks, more data are needed to identify sources of introduction and means of transmission within nursing homes. Nursing home residents who receive hemodialysis (dialysis) might be at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infections because of their frequent exposures outside the nursing home to both community dialysis patients and staff members at dialysis centers (3). Investigation of a COVID-19 outbreak in a Maryland nursing home (facility A) identified a higher prevalence of infection among residents undergoing dialysis (47%; 15 of 32) than among those not receiving dialysis (16%; 22 of 138) (p<0.001).

We evaluated the Panbio&#8482; COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device for diagnosis of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) in symptomatic patients (n = 412) attending primary healthcare centres. METHODS: RAD was performed immediately after sampling following the manufacturer's instructions (reading at 15 min). RT-PCRs were carried out within 24 h of specimen collection. Samples displaying discordant results were processed for culture in Vero E6 cells. Presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in cell cultures was confirmed by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Out of 412 patients, 43 (10.4%) tested positive by RT-PCR and RAD, and 358 (86.9%) tested negative by both methods; discordant results (RT-PCR+/RAD-) were obtained in 11 patients (2.7%). Overall specificity and sensitivity of rapid antigen detection (RAD) was 100% (95%CI 98.7-100%) and 79.6% (95%CI 67.0-88.8%), respectively, taking RT-PCR as the reference. Overall RAD negative predictive value for an estimated prevalence of 5% and 10% was 99% (95%CI 97.4-99.6%) and 97.9% (95%CI 95.9-98.9), respectively. SARS-CoV-2 could not be cultured from specimens yielding RT-PCR+/RAD- results (n = 11). CONCLUSION: The Panbio&#8482; COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device performed well as a POC test for early diagnosis of COVID-19 in primary healthcare centres. More crucially, the data suggested that patients with RT-PCR-proven COVID-19 testing negative by RAD are unlikely to be infectious.","Albert, Eliseo; Torres, Ignacio; Bueno, Felipe; Huntley, Dixie; Molla, Estefanía; Fernández-Fuentes, Miguel Ángel; Martínez, Mireia; Poujois, Sandrine; Forqué, Lorena; Valdivia, Arantxa; Solano de la Asunción, Carlos; Ferrer, Josep; Colomina, Javier; Navarro, David",Clin. microbiol. infect,24,16

Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at increased risk of viral infections, and recent data suggests they may be at an increased risk of poor outcomes with COVID-19. This may be particularly true for those on rituximab or high dose steroids. A huge international effort from the scientific community has so far resulted in the temporary authorisation of three vaccines which offer protection against SARS-CoV-2, with over 30 other vaccines being evaluated in ongoing trials. Although there has historically been concern that vaccines may trigger disease flares of SLE, there is little convincing evidence to show this. In general lupus patients appear to gain good protection from vaccination, although there may be reduced efficacy in those with high disease activity or those on immunosuppressive therapies, such as rituximab or high dose steroids. Recent concerns have been raised regarding rare clotting events with the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine and it is currently unknown whether this risk is higher for those patients with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. With the possibility of annual COVID vaccination programmes in the future, prospective data collection and registries looking at the effect of vaccination on SLE disease control, the incidence of COVID-19 in SLE patients and severity of COVID-19 disease course would all be useful.

In response, many state and local governments issued shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, restricting nonessential activities outside residents' homes (2). CDC initially issued guidance recommending postponing routine adult vaccinations, which was later revised to recommend continuing to administer routine adult vaccines (3). In addition, factors such as disrupted operations of health care facilities and safety concerns regarding exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, resulted in delay or avoidance of routine medical care (4), likely further affecting delivery of routine adult vaccinations. Medicare enrollment and claims data of Parts A (hospital insurance), B (medical insurance), and D (prescription drug insurance) were examined to assess the change in receipt of routine adult vaccines during the pandemic. Weekly receipt of four vaccines (13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV13], 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine [PPSV23], tetanus-diphtheria or tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine [Td/Tdap], and recombinant zoster vaccine [RZV]) by Medicare beneficiaries aged &#8805;65 years during January 5-July 18, 2020, was compared with that during January 6-July 20, 2019, for the total study sample and by race and ethnicity. Overall, weekly administration rates of the four examined vaccines declined by up to 89% after the national emergency declaration in mid-March (1) compared with those during the corresponding period in 2019. During the first week following the national emergency declaration, the weekly vaccination rates were 25%-62% lower than those during the corresponding week in 2019. After reaching their nadirs of 70%-89% below 2019 rates in the second to third week of April 2020, weekly vaccination rates gradually began to recover through mid-July, but by the last study week were still lower than were those during the corresponding period in 2019, with the exception of PPSV23. Vaccination declined sharply for all vaccines studied, overall and across all racial and ethnic groups. While the pandemic continues, vaccination providers should emphasize to patients the importance of continuing to receive routine vaccinations and provide reassurance by explaining the procedures in place to ensure patient safety (3).","Hong, Kai; Zhou, Fangjun; Tsai, Yuping; Jatlaoui, Tara C; Acosta, Anna M; Dooling, Kathleen L; Kobayashi, Miwako; Lindley, Megan C",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,24,20

The WHO first learned about this new virus on December 31, 2019, following a report on a group of cases of ""viral pneumonia"" in Wuhan, People's Republic of China, and declared a pandemic in March 2020. The disease was an almost complete unknown at the outset, but knowledge of its pathophysiology, clinical picture, and treatment options grew and developed rapidly. Objective. Dizziness is a very common symptom that patients report in routine clinical practice and one of the significant clinical manifestations of COVID-19. This short report investigated a possible connection between COVID-19 and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Methods. We present two cases of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which developed within two weeks of SARS-COVID-19 infection, manifesting with mild disease severity in early November 2020. Results. In both cases, the disease manifested by severe, short-lived attacks of vertigo, objective-circular type, with accompanying nausea and vomiting. The symptoms occurred when lying in bed and turning to the right and assuming an upright position. The diagnosis of posterior semicircular canal BPPV (PC-BPPV) was made based on a subjectively and objectively positive right-sided Dix–Hallpike test. Conclusions. The pathophysiology of post-COVID BPPV is probably similar to that of other viral infections, with some of its specificities such as inducing hypercoagulation and microthrombus formation, which can cause significant circulatory disorders possibly affecting its pathogenesis.

Obesity was associated with a higher risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection (odds ratio (OR): 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-1.54; P < 0.00001) and increased severity of COVID-19 (hospitalisation rate: OR: 2.45, 95% CI 1.78-3.39; P < 0.00001; severe cases: OR: 3.74, 95% CI 1.18-11.87; P: 0.02; need for intensive care unit admission: OR: 1.30, 95% CI 1.21-1.40; P < 0.00001; need for invasive mechanical ventilation: OR: 1.59, 95% CI 1.35-1.88; P < 0.00001 and mortality: OR: 1.65, 95% CI 1.21-2.25; P: 0.001). However, we found a non-linear association between BMI and the severity of COVID-19. In conclusion, we found that obesity could increase the risk of SARS-CoV2 infection and aggregate the severity of COVID-19. Further studies are needed to explore the possible mechanisms behind this association.","Yang, Jiao; Ma, ZhiYing; Lei, YanChang",Epidemiol Infect,24,20

A generalized linear mixed model analysis was conducted to determine whether willingness to vaccinate changed in the repeated sample, and a multinominal logistic regression was conducted in all participants to determine whether willingness to vaccinate was associated with demographics, chronic disease, or media use. Willingness to vaccinate slightly decreased between April (87%) and August (85%) but this was not significant. Willingness to vaccinate was lower in people with a certificate or diploma (79%) compared to those with a Bachelor degree (87%), p < 0.01 and lower in infrequent users of traditional media (78%) compared to frequent users of traditional media (89%), p < 0.001. Women were more likely to be unsure if they would be willing to vaccinate (10%) compared to men (7%), p < 0.01.

Syllables of different aerosol production rates were tested and compared to coughing. Results indicate aerosol productions and penetrations are not correlated. E.g. 'ti' and 'ma' have similar production rates but only 'ti' penetrated as far as coughs. All cases exhibited a rapidly penetrating ""jet phase"" followed by a slow ""puff phase.""

The V1 and V2 missiles used in summer and autumn, 1944, functioned as a second wave of bombing, arriving after people believed the danger had passed. Adherence to lockdown and a reluctance to return to work after the lifting of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK were mirrored in the preference for using home-based bomb shelters during the air raids. Heightened sensitivity to risk, or a so-called deep shelter mentality, did not materialise even during the second wave of bomb attacks and some deep bomb shelters were closed because of low occupancy.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study. Mental health was measured using the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory. Mental wellbeing was measured using The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. Data collected on predictors included sex, age, marital status, employment, annual income, region, current smoking, current alcohol consumption, physical multimorbidity, any physical symptoms experienced during self-isolation/social distancing, and the number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. The association between potential predictors and poor mental health was studied using a multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: 932 participants were included. Factors associated with poor mental health were sex (reference: male; female: OR=1.89, 95%CI=1.34-2.68), age (18-24 years: reference;45-54 years: OR=0.27, 95%CI=0.14-0.53; 55-64 years: OR=0.24, 95%CI=0.12-0.47; 65-74years: OR=0.10, 95% CI=0.05-0.22; and &#8805;75years: OR=0.08,95% CI=0.03-0.24),annual income (<£15,000: reference; £25,000-<£40,000: OR=0.54, 95% CI=0.31-0.93; £40,000-<£60,000: OR=0.39, 95% CI=0.22-0.69; and &#8805;£60,000: OR=0.38, 95% CI=0.21-0.67), current smoking (yes: OR=2.59, 95%CI=1.62-4.20), and physical multimorbidity (OR=2.35, 95%CI=1.61-3.46).

Paraoxonase-I (PON1) is a member of the mammalian lactonase enzyme family, serves to the prevention of blood vessel plaque formation by protecting high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein against oxidation. In the current study, we aimed to contribute to drug discovery and to determine the interaction of some calcium channel blockers (CCBs) with PON1. For this purpose, first, the PON1 enzyme was purified from fresh human serum by using different chromatographic techniques. Then, the various concentrations of CCBs were tested on the paraoxonase activity of PON1. IC 50 values were found as 41.00, 48.00, and 180 µM for nimodipine, cinnarizine, and nilvadipine, respectively. PON1 was effectively inhibited by these drugs (K is ranging between 22.13 ± 1.13 and 174.12 ± 20.52 µM). Of these drugs, only the inhibition mechanism of cinnarizine was competitive on PON1. Besides, the molecular docking analysis of cinnarizine was applied to detailed the binding interactions on the active site of PON1. The docking scores for the Glide standard-precision (SP), and Glide extra-precision (XP) modes for 1V04 receptor monitored to be -5.001, and -6.079, respectively. We determined that the CCBs reduced PON1 enzyme activity both in vitro and in silico conditions, significantly. Therefore, further biological studies such as gene expression and in vivo experiments should be done for these drugs. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

As pit latrines and the use of untreated excreta as fertilizer were common in rural China, we surveyed 27 villages of Jiangxi and Hubei provinces and found that pit latrines could be a potential source of SARS-CoV-2 water pollution. Recently, bats have been widely recognized as the source of SARS-CoV-2. There were many possible intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, including pangolin, snake, bird and fish, but which one was still not clear exactly. Here, we proposed a hypothesis to illustrate the mechanism that SARS-CoV-2 might spread from the excreta of infected humans in pit latrines to potential animal hosts, thus becoming a sustainable source of infection in rural China. Therefore, we believe that abolishing pit latrines and banning the use of untreated excreta as fertilizer can improve the local living environment and effectively prevent COVID-19 and other potential waterborne diseases that could emanate from the excreta of infected persons. Although this study focused on rural areas in China, the results could also be applied to low-income countries, especially in Africa.","Liu, Lilong; Hu, Junyi; Hou, Yaxin; Tao, Zhen; Chen, Zhaohui; Chen, Ke",Sci Total Environ,24,16

The rapidly evolving situation compels officials and executives to continuously adapt policies and social distancing measures depending on the current state of the spread of the disease. In this context, it is crucial for policymakers to have a firm grasp on what the current state of the pandemic is as well as to have an idea of how the infective situation is going to unfold in the next days. However, as in many other situations of compulsorily-notifiable diseases and beyond, cases are reported with delay to a central register, with this delay deferring an up-to-date view of the state of things. We provide a stable tool for monitoring current infection levels as well as predicting infection numbers in the immediate future at the regional level. We accomplish this through nowcasting of cases that have not yet been reported as well as through forecasting of future infections. The two steps are also combined in forenowcasting. We apply our model to German data, for which our focus lies in explaining and predicting infectious behaviour by district, age group and gender.","Nicola, Giacomo De; Schneble, Marc; Kauermann, Goran; Berger, Ursula",,24,16

Population-level effects of COVID-19 on patients with ESKD in the United States are uncertain. METHODS: We identified patients with ESKD from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data during epidemiologic weeks 3-27 of 2017-2020 and corresponding weeks of 2017-2019, stratifying them by kidney replacement therapy. Outcomes comprised hospitalization for COVID-19, all-cause death, and hospitalization for reasons other than COVID-19. We estimated adjusted relative rates (ARRs) of death and non-COVID-19 hospitalization during epidemiologic weeks 13-27 of 2020 (March 22 to July 4) versus corresponding weeks in 2017-2019. RESULTS: Among patients on dialysis, the rate of COVID-19 hospitalization peaked between March 22 and April 25 2020. Non-Hispanic Black race and Hispanic ethnicity associated with higher rates of COVID-19 hospitalization, whereas peritoneal dialysis was associated with lower rates. During weeks 13-27, ARRs of death in 2020 versus 2017-2019 were 1.17 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.16 to 1.19) and 1.30 (95% CI, 1.24 to 1.36) among patients undergoing dialysis or with a functioning transplant, respectively. Excess mortality was higher among non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and Asian patients. Among patients on dialysis, the rate of non-COVID-19 hospitalization during weeks 13-27 in 2020 was 17% lower versus hospitalization rates for corresponding weeks in 2017-2019. CONCLUSIONS: During the first half of 2020, the clinical outcomes of patients with ESKD were greatly affected by COVID-19, and racial and ethnic disparities were apparent. These findings should be considered in prioritizing administration of COVID-19 vaccination.","Weinhandl, Eric D; Wetmore, James B; Peng, Yi; Liu, Jiannong; Gilbertson, David T; Johansen, Kirsten L",J Am Soc Nephrol,24,16

Methods: This prospective observational study included 53 diabetic and 50 non-diabetic patients aged >18 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists' physical status I-III having similar fasting intervals. Before induction, using standard gastric scanning protocol, qualitative and quantitative assessments of gastric antrum in supine and right lateral decubitus (RLD) positions were performed with a curved array probe. USG grade, cross-sectional area (CSA) of the antrum and GV were calculated. The gastric antrum was classified as Grade 0, 1 or 2, signifying empty antrum, fluid in RLD position only and antral fluid in both supine and RLD positions, respectively. Results: In supine position, CC and AP diameters were 1.96 ± 0.41 cm and 0.9 ± 0.57 cm in control group and 2.28 ± 0.50 cm and 1.39 ± 0.44 cm in diabetic group, respectively. In RLD, CC was 2.28 ± 0.57 cm and AP was 1.24 ± 0.42 cm in control group as compared to CC 2.54 ± 0.56 cm and AP 1.82 ± 0.56 cm in diabetic group.

Towards this goal, we survey more than 100 software practitioners to understand the artifacts and setups needed to enhance trust in automatically generated patches. Based on the feedback from the survey on developer preferences, we quantitatively evaluate existing test-suite based program repair tools. We find that they cannot produce high-quality patches within a top-10 ranking and an acceptable time period of 1 hour. The developer feedback from our qualitative study and the observations from our quantitative examination of existing repair tools point to actionable insights to drive program repair research. Specifically, we note that producing repairs within an acceptable time-bound is very much dependent on leveraging an abstract search space representation of a rich enough search space.

The mediating role of impulse buying and the moderating role of neuroticism on food waste during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic were also uncovered in this study. A self-administered online survey was distributed to a total of 274 consumers who had experienced a lockdown during the COVID-19 outbreak and were also regular buyers of food. Empirical findings supported the fact that social media usage, neuroticism, and impulse buying were positively related to food waste. Impulse buying mediates the relationship between social media usage and food waste, as well as between neuroticism and food waste. The study results also revealed that neuroticism positively moderates the relationship between social media usage and food waste.

Over the past decade, the overall incidence of LVFWR has decreased given the advancements in reperfusion therapies. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant delay in hospital presentation of patients suffering myocardial infarctions, leading to a higher incidence of mechanical complications from myocardial infarctions such as LVFWR. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case in which a patient suffered a LVFWR as a mechanical complication from myocardial infarction due to delay in seeking care over fear of contracting COVID-19 from the medical setting. The patient had been having chest pain for a few days but refused to seek medical care due to fear of contracting COVID-19 from within the medical setting. He eventually suffered a cardiac arrest at home from a massive inferior myocardial infarction and found to be in cardiac tamponade from a left ventricular perforation. He was emergently taken to the operating room to attempt to repair the rupture but he ultimately expired on the operating table. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of LVFWR has been on a more significant rise over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic as patients delay seeking care over fear of contracting COVID-19 from within the medical setting. Clinicians should consider mechanical complications of MI when patients present as an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, as delay in seeking care is often the exacerbating factor.","Nasr, George H; Glovaci, Diana; Mikhail, Andrew; Sinfield, Steven; Chen, Kevin; Patel, Hardikkumar; Johl, Michael; Chakravarthy, Bharath; Singh, Siddharth; Sagebin, Fabio; El-Farra, Ailin Barseghian",J Cardiothorac Surg,24,24

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Elective surgeries during the pandemic was limited acutely. Access to surgical care was restored in a recovery phase but backlogs and societal shifts are hypothesized to impact surgical access. METHODS: Adults with electronic health record orders for procedures (""procedure requests""), from March 16 to August 25, 2019 and March 16 to August 25, 2020, were included. Logistic regression was performed for requested procedures that were not scheduled. Linear regression was performed for wait time from request to scheduled or completed procedure. RESULTS: The number of patients with procedure requests decreased 20.8%, from 26,789 in 2019 to 21,162 in 2020. Patients aged 36-50 and >65âyears, those speaking non-English languages, those with Medicare or no insurance, and those living >â100 miles away had disproportionately larger decreases. Requested procedures had significantly increased adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of not being scheduled for patients with primary languages other than English, Spanish, or Cantonese (aOR 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-2.28); unpartnered marital status (aOR 1.21, 95% CI 1.07-1.37); uninsured or self-pay (aOR 2.03, 95% CI 1.53-2.70). Significantly longer wait times were seen for patients aged 36-65âyears; with Medi-Cal insurance; from ZIP codes with lower incomes; and from ZIP codes >â100 miles away.

High-throughput and robust methods are being developed for the accurate measurement of metabolites associated with disease. Traditionally, quantitative assays have utilized triple quadrupole (QQQ) MS based methods; however, the use of such focused methods removes the ability to perform discovery-based metabolic phenotyping. An integrated workflow for the hybrid simultaneous quantification of 34 biogenic amines in combination with full scan high-resolution accurate mass (HRAM) exploratory metabolic phenotyping is presented. Primary and secondary amines are derivatized with 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate prior to revered-phase liquid chromatographic separation and mass spectrometric detection. Using the HRAM-MS data, retrospective phenotypic data mining could be performed, demonstrating the versatility of HRAM-MS instrumentation in a clinical and molecular epidemiological environment. Quantitative performance was assessed using two MS detector platforms: Waters TQ-XS (QQQ; n = 3) and Bruker Impact II QToF (HRAMS-MS; n = 2) and three human biofluids (plasma, serum and urine). Finally, each platform was assessed using a certified external reference sample (NIST SRM 1950 plasma). Intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision were comparable between the QQQ and QToF instruments (<15%), with excellent linearity (R2 > 0.99) over the quantification range of 1-400 µmol L-1. Quantitative values were comparable across all instruments for human plasma, serum and urine samples, and calculated concentrations were verified against certified reference values for NIST SRM 1950 plasma as an external reference. As a real-life biological exemplar, the method was applied to plasma samples obtained from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients versus healthy controls. Both the QQQ and QToF approaches were equivalent in being able to correctly classify SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Critically, the use of HRAM full scan data was also assessed for retrospective exploratory mining of data to extract additional biogenic amines of biomarker interest beyond the 34 quantified targets.","Gray, Nicola; Lawler, Nathan G; Yang, Rongchang; Morillon, Aude-Claire; Gay, Melvin C L; Bong, Sze-How; Holmes, Elaine; Nicholson, Jeremy K; Whiley, Luke",Talanta,24,26

However, the exact mechanism remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the role of IL-1ß, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, smooth muscle cell apoptosis, and elastic fibre fracture in the development of TAD in a rat model. METHODS: The TAD rat model was induced by ß-aminopropionitrile (BAPN). TAD was investigated in 112 male Sprague-Dawley rats, which were equally divided into four groups of 28 rats (Control, BAPN, BAPN + IL-1ß, and BAPN + IL-1ß antibody). Systolic blood pressure, survival, and the development of TAD were measured after six weeks. Expression of IL-1ß, MMP-2, and MMP-9 was measured by Western blot. Apoptosis, aortic elastin concentration, and biomechanical characteristics were measured by the TdT mediated dUTP nick end labelling assay, Victoria blue staining, and in vitro testing. RESULTS: During six weeks, the mortality was 0% (0/28) in the control group, 53.6% (15/28) in the BAPN group (p < .001 compared with the control group), 75.0% (21/28) in the BAPN + IL-1ß group (p = .007 compared with the BAPN group), and 35.7% (10/28) in the BAPN + IL-1ß antibody group (p = .023 compared with BAPN group and p < .001 compared with the BAPN + IL-1ß group). IL-1ß treatment deteriorates BAPN induced mortality and aneurysm expansion, which were attenuated by anti-IL-1ß treatment. In BAPN + IL-1ß group, stress and strain parameters were decreased by 13.5%-53.5% and elastin content was decreased by 14%, and IL-1ß, MMP-2, and MMP-9 were expressed higher by 117%, 108%, and 75% when compared with the rats in the BAPN group. Contrarily, in the BAPN + IL-1ß antibody group, the above changes could be completely (strain, elastin content, and expression of MMP-2) or partly (elasticity modulus, stress, and expression of MMP-9) blocked by anti-IL-1ß treatment. CONCLUSION: IL-1ß plays a critical role in TAD formation by altering the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, degrading the aortic wall matrix, causing elastic fibre rupture, and changing the stress or strain of the aortic wall. Anti-IL-1ß reduces the later effects and could be one of the molecular targets for prognosis and drug treatment of TAD in the future.","Guo, Ling-Ling; Wu, Meng-Tao; Zhang, Li-Wei; Chu, Yong-Xin; Tian, Peng; Jing, Zai-Ping; Li, Jia-Si; Sun, Yu-Dong; Yeung, Kak K; Zhang, Lei",Eur. j. vasc. endovasc. surg,24,16

There are many causes of rhabdomyolysis, and the etiology is often multifactorial or unclear. Current data suggest that acute COVID-19 may cause muscle injury that can lead to rhabdomyolysis, particularly in cases of severe illness requiring prolonged hospitalization; however, data on the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the musculoskeletal system are lacking. CASE REPORT We present a case of a woman with generalized weakness 1 week following discharge from the hospital after a prolonged admission for severe COVID-19. She was found to have acute kidney injury and elevated creatine kinase (CK) of 1775 U/L (normal 36-234 U/L). Her home medications, including her statin, were held, but her CK continued to rise, peaking at 15 085 U/L, and she developed renal failure necessitating renal replacement therapy. A thorough work-up for the underlying etiology of her rhabdomyolysis was pursued, including testing for autoimmune myositis, statin-associated necrotizing autoimmune myositis, and a muscle biopsy, which were all unrevealing. Ultimately, the patient's rhabdomyolysis was determined to likely be secondary to a post-viral myopathy from COVID-19. A toxic myopathy from medication use or a delayed critical illness myopathy from her recent prolonged hospitalization could have also contributed. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the wide differential diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis in the setting of recent COVID-19 and prolonged hospitalization. It demonstrates the possibility that muscle injury and resultant rhabdomyolysis may be a late complication of COVID-19 that is not yet fully described in the literature.","Byler, Julie; Harrison, Rebecca; Fell, Lindsey L",Am J Case Rep,24,20

The median age was 37 years, with 35 (52.2%) females. Among these COVID-19 patients, thirty-seven (55.2%) patients were seropositive for EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM antibody. EBV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection patients had a 3.09-fold risk of having a fever symptom than SARS-CoV-2 infection alone patients (95% CI 1.11-8.56; P = 0.03). C-reactive protein (CRP) (P = 0.02) and the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (P = 0.04) in EBV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection patients were higher than that in SARS-CoV-2 infection alone patients. EBV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection patients had a higher portion of corticosteroid use than the SARS-CoV-2 infection alone patients (P = 0.03). We find a high incidence of EBV coinfection in COVID-19 patients. EBV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection was associated with fever and increased inflammation. EBV reactivation may associated with the severity of COVID-19.","Chen, Ting; Song, Jiayi; Liu, Hongli; Zheng, Hongmei; Chen, Changzheng",Sci Rep,24,1

Antiphospholipidic antibodies were found in some studies. AIM: Assessment of protein S activity in patients with COVID-19 as a cause this prothrombotic state, and of the association of protein S activity with worse outcome. METHODS: All patients admitted for COVID-19 disease in a university hospital between 15th of May and 15th of July 2020 were prospectively enrolled into this cohort study. Patients treated with antivitamin K anticoagulants and with liver disease were excluded. All patients had protein S activity determined at admission. The main outcome was survival, secondary outcomes were clinical severity and lung damage. RESULTS: 91 patients were included, of which 21 (23.3%) died. Protein S activity was decreased in 65% of the patients. Death was associated with lower activity of protein S (median 42% vs. 58%, p<0.001), and the association remained after adjustment for age, inflammation markers and ALAT. There was a dose-response relationship between protein S activity and clinical severity (Kendall_tau coefficient = -0.320, p < 0.001; Jonckheere-Terpstra for trend: p<0.001) or pulmonary damage on CT scan (Kendall_tau coefficient = -0.290, p<0.001; Jonckheere-Terpstra for trend: p<0.001). High neutrophil count was also independently associated with death (p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Protein S activity was lower in COVID-19 patients, and its level was associated with survival and disease severity, suggesting that it may have a role in the thrombotic manifestations of the disease.","Stoichitoiu, Laura Elena; Pinte, Larisa; Balea, Marius Ioan; Nedelcu, Valentin; Badea, Camelia; Baicus, Cristian",Rom. j. intern. med,24,5

This study aimed to provide insights on dental hygienists' employment patterns as well as their attitudes toward working as dental hygienists during a pandemic.Methods: Licensed dental hygienists were invited to participate in a web-based 30-question survey between September 29 and October 8, 2020. Employment questions included current and pre-pandemic work status, reasons for not currently working as a dental hygienist, and estimated levels of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the primary work location. All statistical analysis was conducted in Qualtrics Core XM; cross tabulation was used to examine dental hygienist working patterns and attitudes by age, practice PPE supply, and other factors.Results: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an estimated 8% reduction in dental hygienist employment. The majority (59.1%, n=205) of this reduction is voluntary, with the main reason being general concerns over COVID-19 (48.3%, n=100). Other reasons include issues surrounding childcare and concerns over safety measures in the workplace. Dental hygienists aged 65 and older were most likely to have left the workforce voluntarily. More than half of respondents reported that their work locations had more than a two-week supply of most PPE items, although about 10% did not know supply levels. Dental hygienists working in settings with lower supplies of PPE were more concerned with COVID-19 transmission risk to themselves or to patients.Conclusion: COVID-19 has led to a reduction in the dental hygienist workforce that is likely to persist until the pandemic passes.The dental hygienist labor market has tightened and employers may continue to experience difficulties in filling vacant dental hygienist positions until the pandemic subsides. There is also likely to be a longer term, yet smaller, impact on dental hygiene employment levels.","Gurenlian, JoAnn R; Morrissey, Rachel; Estrich, Cameron G; Battrell, Ann; Bessner, Sue K; Lynch, Ann; Mikkelsen, Matthew; Araujo, Marcelo W B; Vujicic, Marko",J Dent Hyg,24,1

The aim was to understand the extent to which MCs were able to operate when physical meetings were not possible and how they achieved particularly in relation to the adaptation and coping model and practical, emotional and social adjustment. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with people affected by dementia, staff, volunteers, managers and trustees from MCs. Data were collected on the type and quantity of contact MCs had with people affected by dementia during lockdown. Data were coded and mapped against adaptation and coping strategies, i.e. practical understanding and empowerment, optimising emotional well-being and opportunities for social engagement. Findings: A range of remote approaches, both technological (e.g. using online platforms) and non-technological (e.g. newsletters and post) were implemented alongside limited face-to-face contact. Regular MC activities were adapted using the different approaches. It was possible to map all the adaptation and coping model support strategies to the activities delivered in this way. MCs were able to adapt rapidly to continue to support people to adjust to change. Social implications: Moving forward, combining approaches (usual MC and remote) means person-centred support could be optimized, addressing social isolation and reaching those who cannot attend MCs. Originality/value: This paper offers new insight into the extent to which community-based support for people with dementia can continue when face-to-face contact is not possible because of COVID-19. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Evans, S.; Bray, J.; Brooker, D.",Working with Older People,24,20

It caused more 3.9 million deaths. This paper introduces a symptomatic-asymptomatic-recoverer-dead differential equation model (SARDDE). It gives the conditions of the asymptotical stability on the disease-free equilibrium of SARDDE. It proposes the necessary conditions of disease spreading for the SARDDE. Based on the reported data of the first and the second COVID-19 epidemics in Beijing and simulations, it determines the parameters of SARDDE, respectively. Numerical simulations of SARDDE describe well the outcomes of current symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, recovered symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, and died individuals, respectively. The numerical simulations suggest that both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals cause lesser asymptomatic spread than symptomatic spread; the blocking rates of about 90% and 97% to the symptomatic individuals cannot prevent the spread of the first and second COVID19 epidemics in Beijing, respectively. Virtual simulations suggest that the strict prevention and control strategies implemented by Beijing government are not only very effective but also completely necessary. The numerical simulations suggest also that using the data from the beginning to the days after about two weeks from the turning points can estimate approximately the following outcomes of the two COVID-19 academics, respectively.

Recent worldwide regulatory guidance for pharmaceutical industry trials has allowed discussion of alternatives to the ITT approach to analysis; different treatment effects can be considered which may be more clinically meaningful and more relevant to patients and prescribers. The key concept is of a trial ""estimand"", a precise description of the estimated treatment effect. The strategy chosen to account for patients who discontinue treatment or take alternative medications which are not part of the randomised treatment regimen are important determinants of this treatment effect. One strategy to account for these events is treatment policy, which corresponds to an ITT approach. Alternative equally valid strategies address what the treatment effect is if the patient actually takes the treatment or does not use specific alternative medication. There is no single right answer to which strategy is most appropriate, the solution depends on the key clinical question of interest. The estimands framework discussed in the new guidance has been particularly useful in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic and has clarified what choices are available to account for the impact of COVID-19 on clinical trials. Specifically, an ITT approach addresses a treatment effect that may not be generalisable beyond the current pandemic.","Keene, Oliver N; Wright, David; Phillips, Alan; Wright, Melanie",Contemp Clin Trials,24,24

AIM: The aim of this study was to capture the experience of such a lockdown in Australians living alone, with and without a dog or a cat. METHOD: Three hundred and eighty-four participants completed an online survey evaluating their levels of loneliness, mindfulness and mood. For participants who owned a dog or a cat, a measure of dog/cat interactions was also administered as well as two open-ended questions about how being a pet owner affected their experience of COVID-19 and how COVID-19 affected their pet. RESULTS: Contrary to expectations, cat owners were found to be less mindful than non-owners and pet interactions did not account for levels of loneliness or levels of mindfulness. In line with our expectations, however, stress and depression positively predicted loneliness, while mindfulness and being a dog owner were protective against it. Insights from qualitative responses suggest that this might be due to the fact that dogs encourage a routine which involves getting out of the house and walking, which itself offers opportunities to socialise with other people doing the same thing. CONCLUSION: These findings add to the emerging literature on mental well-being during a lockdown and the unique role that pets play in their owners' experiences.","Oliva, Jessica Lee; Johnston, Kim Louise",Int J Soc Psychiatry,24,1

The cytokine storm is a known factor causing major clinical symptoms leading to death in COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: To investigate and compare the serum levels of different cytokines in COVID-19 patients with different clinical severity. METHODS: Concentrations of serum cytokines, including IL-1ß, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-&#945;, IFN-Î³, and GM-CSF, were measured in 61 COVID-19 patients and 31 normal controls with ELISA. We investigated the correlation between the levels of these cytokines and clinical severity, CRP level, neutrophil and lymphocyte count in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Our data indicated that the levels of IL-1ß, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-&#945;, IFN-Î³, and GM-CSF, but not IL-10 were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared to normal controls. Statistical analysis showed that the level of IL-1ß, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-&#945;, IFN-Î³, and GM-CSF were higher in severe COVID-19 than those of mild cases. The concentrations of all mentioned cytokines were negatively associated with the absolute count of lymphocytes, and positively correlated with the CRP level and the absolute count of neutrophils.

Severe storms and hurricanes can have long-lasting effects at all community levels. Persons who are prepared and well-informed are often better able to protect themselves and others (1). Major hurricanes can devastate low-lying coastal areas and cause injury and loss of life from storm surge, flooding, and high winds (2). State and local government entities play a significant role in preparing communities for hurricanes and by evacuating coastal communities before landfall to reduce loss of life from flooding, wind, and power outages (3). Laws can further improve planning and outreach for catastrophic events by ensuring explicit statutory authority over evacuations of communities at risk (4). State evacuation laws vary widely and might not adequately address information and communication flows to reach populations living in disaster-prone areas who are at risk. To understand the range of evacuation laws in coastal communities that historically have been affected by hurricanes, a systematic policy scan of the existing laws supporting hurricane evacuation in eight southern coastal states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas) was conducted. After conducting a thematic analysis, this report found that all eight states have laws to execute evacuation orders, traffic control (egress/ingress), and evacuation to shelters. However, only four of the states have laws related to community outreach, delivery of public education programs, and public notice requirements. The findings in this report suggest a need for authorities in hurricane-prone states to review how to execute evacuation policies, particularly with respect to community outreach and communication to populations at risk. Implementation of state evacuation laws and policies that support hurricane evacuation management can help affected persons avoid harm and enhance community resiliency (5). Newly emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have and will continue to additionally challenge hurricane evacuations.","Kruger, Judy; Smith, Michael J; Chen, Brenda; Paetznick, Brandon; Bradley, Belen Moran; Abraha, Rosa; Logan, Marinda; Chang, Erich R; Sunshine, Gregory; Romero-Steiner, Sandra",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,24,4

The study of the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 has evolved with the hope that they may be useful as markers for the disease, prognostication and pathogenic insights into the disease. With regard to the hair, clinicopathological correlations have remained elusive. More recently, androgenetic alopecia and grey hair have been proposed as cutaneous markers for elevated severity risk. So far, we have only observed postinfectious effluvium in a causal association with COVID-19. The onset and acuity of hair shedding depended on the clinical severity of disease.

One of the most important proteins of the virus is an enzyme, called 3CLpro or main protease, already identified as an important pharmacological target also in SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS) viruses. This protein triggers the production of a whole series of enzymes necessary for the virus to carry out its replicating and infectious activities. Therefore, it is crucial to gain a deeper understanding of 3CLpro structure and function in order to effectively target this enzyme. All-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to examine the different conformational behaviors of the monomeric and dimeric form of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro apo structure, as revealed by microsecond time scale MD simulations. Our results also shed light on the conformational dynamics of the loop regions at the entry of the catalytic site. Studying, at atomic level, the characteristics of the active site and obtaining information on how the protein can interact with its substrates will allow the design of molecules able to block the enzymatic function crucial for the virus.","Grottesi, Alessandro; Besker, Neva; Emerson, Andrew; Manelfi, Candida; Beccari, Andrea R; Frigerio, Francesco; Lindahl, Erik; Cerchia, Carmen; Talarico, Carmine",,24,14

The identification and characterization of interactions between cellular and pathogenic components are essential for the development of antiviral treatments. Due to its small-sized genome, HBV highly depends on cellular functions to produce and export progeny particles. Deploying biochemical-silencing methods and molecular interaction studies in HBV-expressing liver cells, we herein identified the cellular ERGIC-53, a high-mannose-specific lectin, and distinct components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export machinery COPII as crucial factors of viral trafficking and egress. Whereas the COPII subunits Sec24A, Sec23B and Sar1 are needed for both viral and subviral HBV particle exit, ERGIC-53 appears as an exclusive element of viral particle propagation, therefore interacting with the N146-glycan of the HBV envelope in a productive manner. Cell-imaging studies pointed to ER-derived, subcellular compartments where HBV assembly initiates. Moreover, our findings provide evidence that HBV exploits the functions of ERGIC-53 and Sec24A after the envelopment of nucleocapsids at these compartments in conjunction with endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) components. These data reveal novel insights into HBV assembly and trafficking, illustrating therapeutic prospects for intervening with the viral life cycle.","Zeyen, Lisa; Döring, Tatjana; Prange, Reinhild",,24,26

Although vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are being developed at a record-breaking pace, the majority of those that are licensed or currently registered in clinical trials are formulated as an injectable product, requiring a tightly regulated cold-chain infrastructure, and primarily inducing systemic immune responses.Areas covered: Here, we shed light on the status of inhaled vaccines against viral pathogens, providing background to the role of the mucosal immune system and elucidating what factors determine an inhalable vaccine's efficacy. We also discuss whether the development of an inhalable powder vaccine formulation against SARS-CoV-2 could be feasible. The review was conducted using relevant studies from PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar.Expert opinion: We believe that the scope of vaccine research should be broadened toward inhalable dry powder formulations since dry vaccines bear several advantages. Firstly, their dry state can tremendously increase vaccine stability and shelf-life. Secondly, they can be inhaled using disposable inhalers, omitting the need for trained health-care personnel and, therefore, facilitating mass-vaccination campaigns. Thirdly, inhalable vaccines may provide improved protection since they can induce an IgA-mediated mucosal immune response.","Heida, Rick; Hinrichs, Wouter Lj; Frijlink, Henderik W",Expert rev. vaccines (Online),24,10

There are many lessons to be learned about teaching and learning in the digital age. While we evaluate the full impact and prepare ourselves for the new normal, it is worth reflecting on some of the positive aspects of online teaching and learning and understanding how students, teachers and the wider faculty have been able to support each other through the challenges of the pandemic. In this article, we offer a perspective on teaching an online Global Health course to engineering students. RESULTS: The course, taught by a physician, provides a grounding in basic medical, scientific and engineering principles and is available to students of diverse engineering specialties. Students developed skills and gained confidence in active listening, sourcing and critical appraisal of information, interdisciplinary teamwork, needs assessment, problem analysis, problem-solving, effective communication, and organisation and delivery of information (in English). Students learned the importance of engineering in landmark historical public health projects, the delivery of modern health care, and the pressing need to develop engineering solutions to current global health problems. Course assessment was formative: 20% attendance and active participation in online classes, 30% problem-solving, 30% student presentations, and 20% written abstracts for two class projects: historical innovations and medicine in the future.

We used hemoperfusion (HP) as a therapeutic option in our patients. The aims of this study are to report characteristics, rates and outcomes of all patients affected by infection with SARS-CoV-2 undergoing HD and were treated under our care focusing on the impact of HP on them. METHOD: This is an observational study. Our Dialysis Unit has been assigned as a referral unit for Covid-19 positive HD patients. Patients divided to 2 groups: first group of patients underwent HD sessions with Hemoperfusion (A) and the second one received HD sessions without any other extracorporeal blood purification method (B). We used resin-directed hemoadsorption cartridges (HA-330 and HA-130) manufactured by the Jafron Biomedical Company, China. We registered all the data regarding the clinical course of our patients population. Age, primary cause of end stage renal disease, weight, clinical presentation, HD history, outcome, days of hospitalization. RESULTS: Group A 13 patients (4 males) have been enrolled in this group with mean age of 74 years old. 5 of them were presented asymptomatic at admission and 7 of them admitted with or developed during their stay pleural effusions. 4 of them were asymptomatic without effusions during the whole hospital stay. 12 patients received HP for 3 hours in our Dialysis Unit during the planned HD session and one patient received Hemoperfusion in ICU during CRRT. 6 patients had one session of Hemoperfusion (with HA130, 4 patients and with HA 330, 2 patients). 6 patients had 2 sessions (7 days interval) either with HA 130 both sessions (3 patients) or with HA 330 followed 7 days after with HA 130 (3 patients). The patients that admitted in ICU started HP the third day of her admission. The pattern was as follows: We used HA330 in 3 consecutive days during CRRT. In Day 10 we used HA130 and in Day 13 HA330. HP was performed for 3 hours. 24 days was the average hospitalization stay before starting HP for the 12 patients in boards. 9 patients discharged from the hospital after 43 days of hospitalization (range: 35-56 days). 30 days were the mean hospitalization stay for the diceased ones. We did not observe any side effects with HP cartridges (hypotension, reduction of platelets, bleeding). Group B 9 patients (7 males) with mean age of 75 years old did not receive HP during their hospitalization. All of them were presented symptomatic. 8 out of 9 patients died after 6 days of hospitalization (range: 1-14 days), 2 of them in ICU. CONCLUSION: To sum up, HP seems to be a helpful, safe an quite efficient tool in the battle against Covid-19 in HD patients. Despite the method is unspecific, our lack of strong evidence, our views are with the opinion that is an reliable alternative therapy. However, the real impact of HP on the patient’s clinical course (time of initiation, therapeutic protocols, tools to evaluate response) has yet to be determined. The above notice does not minimize the great interest for the method that renal community should give.","Griveas, Ioannis; Schinas, Antonis; Balitsari, Anthoula; Asimakopoulos, Gerasimos; Pratilas, Evangelos",Nephrol Dial Transplant,24,1

This study aimed to explore the trend of COVID-19 infection in a peripheral region of Bangladesh during one of the largest festivals to develop an evidence-based hypothesis for its influence on the transmission rate of COVID-19. This study conducted a quantitative analysis of secondary data on COVID-19 collected from the Directorate General of Health Services Bangladesh (DGHS) and divisional director’s office in the Mymensingh division. To explore the influence of one of the biggest festivals (Eid-ul-Adha) on the trend of COVID-19 infection, we analyzed data from a week before the festival to 2 weeks following the festival. The infection rate (positive cases per million of the population) and the test positivity rate (positive cases among the total number of conducted diagnostic tests) of each day during this period were calculated both for the Mymensingh region and national level. Both the test positivity rate (TPR) and infection rates in the Mymensingh region demonstrated an increasing trend. The mean test positivity rate of the Mymensingh region on the week before the festival was 9.5%. It increased to a mean test positivity rate of 13% in the following week and further rose to a rate of 17% in the next week. The infection rate of Mymensingh also increased more than 2 folds from the day of the festival (2.0-5.3 cases per million) within the next 2 weeks. The TPR and infection rate on the national level remained similar throughout the study period. Mass mobility during Eid-ul-Adha influences the increased transmission of COVID-19 among the peripheral regions of Bangladesh from the central capital city Dhaka. The findings will help policymakers plan and implement travel restrictions during festivals during the pandemic in LMICs.","Rahman, Farah Naz; Rahman, A. K. M.

Among them, 116 patients recovered and were discharged, 2 patients died, and the median length of hospital stay was 22 (range: 9–41) days. On admission, 76.3% of the patients presented with fever, and the laboratory studies showed a decrease in lymphocyte (LYM) count and an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Within the studies’ chest CTs, the median number of involved lung lobes was 4 (range: 0–5) and the median number of involved lung segments was 9 (range 0–20). The left lower lobe and the right lower lobe were the most likely areas to be involved (89.0% and 83.9%), and 84.7% of the patients had inflammatory changes in both lungs. The main manifestations on chest CT were ground glass opacities (31.4%), ground glass opacities and consolidation (20.3%), ground glass opacities and reticular patterns (32.2%), mixed type (13.6%), and white lungs (1.7%); common accompanying signs included linear opacities (55.9%), air bronchograms (46.6%), thick small vessel shadows (36.4%), and pleural hypertrophy (13.6%). The chest CT at discharge showed complete absorption of lesions in 19 cases (16.1%), but not in the remaining 99 cases. Lesions remained in a median of 3 lung lobes (range: 0–5). Residual lesions remained in a median of 5 lung segments (range: 0–20). The residual lesions mainly presented as ground glass opacities (61.0%), and the main accompanying sign was linear opacities (59.3%). Based on chest CT, the median maximum PII of lungs was 30.0% (range: 0–97.5%), and the median PII after discharge in the patients excluding the two deaths was 12.5% (range: 0–53.0%). PII was significantly negatively correlated with the LYM count and significantly positively correlated with body temperature, LDH, CRP, and ESR. There was no significant correlation between the PII and the white blood cell count, but the grade of PII correlated well with the clinical classification. PII can be used to monitor the severity and the treatment outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia, provide help for clinical classification, assist in treatment plan adjustments and aid assessments for discharge.","Peng, Song; Chen, Jinqing; Zhang, Wendy; Zhang, Bangjun; Liu, Zhifeng; Liu, Lang; Wu, Zhaofeng; Fu, Rui; Li, Xiuhua; Lv, Fajin",Sci Rep,24,16

Collected from Poynter Institute's official website and following a quantitative content analysis method along with descriptive statistical analysis, this research produces some novel insights regarding COVID-19 misinformation. The findings show that India (15.94%), the US (9.74%), Brazil (8.57%), and Spain (8.03%) are the four most misinformation-affected countries. Based on the results, it is presumed that the prevalence of COVID-19 misinformation can have a positive association with the COVID-19 situation. Social media (84.94%) produces the highest amount of misinformation, and the internet (90.5%) as a whole is responsible for most of the COVID-19 misinformation. Moreover, Facebook alone produces 66.87% misinformation among all social media platforms. Of all countries, India (18.07%) produced the highest amount of social media misinformation, perhaps thanks to the country's higher internet penetration rate, increasing social media consumption, and users' lack of internet literacy. On the other hand, countries like Turkey, the US, Brazil, and the Philippines where either political control over media is intense or political conservatism is apparent, experienced a higher amount of misinformation from mainstream media, political figures, and celebrities. Although the prevalence of misinformation was the highest in March 2020, given the present trends, it may likely to increase slightly in 2021.","Al-Zaman, M. S.",,24,5

Families have experienced a heightened amount of physical, psychological, emotional, and financial stress. Infants and children living with stress have the potential for delayed developmental milestones, difficulty with emotional regulation, and social or behavioral issues. PURPOSE This study aims to determine if the pandemic has affected developmental outcomes in infants and toddlers. METHODOLOGY Prepandemic and postpandemic developmental (ASQ-3) scores were obtained from charts of 1,024 patients (6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months) from two pediatric practices. RESULTS There were no significant differences in prepandemic and postpandemic ASQ-3 scores for the overall sample. Age-group analysis showed statistically significant differences in domain scores. Postpandemic problem-solving scores decreased among 6-month-olds while increasing among 24-month-olds. Categorization by score interpretation categories showed a slight decrease in postpandemic scores in the communication domain among 6- and 12-month-olds. CONCLUSIONS The pandemic has the potential to affect childhood development. However, the results of this study are reassuring, showing only slight differences in developmental scores prepandemic versus postpandemic. More studies are needed to establish causation and possible trends in future developmental trajectories. IMPLICATIONS An increased focus on communication screening and promotion of language and communication skills in young children postpandemic is needed. Education about the importance of parent-child engagement, nurturing relationships, opportunities for free-play and exploration, and caregiver support and stress reduction will continue to be of paramount importance.","Imboden, Annie; Sobczak, Bernadette K; Griffin, Valerie",Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,24,1

SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which is almost preserved across different viral species can be a potential target for development of antiviral drugs, including nucleoside analogues (NA). However, ExoN proofreading activity of CoVs leads to their protection from several NAs. Therefore, potential platforms based on the development of efficient NAs with broad-spectrum efficacy against human CoVs should be explored. This study was then aimed to present an overview on the development of NAs-based drug repurposing for targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by computational analysis. Afterwards, the clinical development of some NAs including Favipiravir, Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, Tenofovir, and Remdesivir as potential inhibitors of RdRp, were surveyed. Overall, exploring broad-spectrum NAs as promising inhibitors of RdRp may provide useful information about the identification of potential antiviral repurposed drugs against SARS-CoV-2.","Khan, Suliman; Attar, Farnoosh; Bloukh, Samir Haj; Sharifi, Majid; Nabi, Faisal; Bai, Qian; Khan, Rizwan Hasan; Falahati, Mojtaba",Int J Biol Macromol,24,16

We used Clauset-Newman-Moore (CNM) clustering algorithm to develop web-network of confirmed cases to identified clusters of community transmission. Results: Out of 1192 confirmed cases, 90.60% were symptomatic and 9.39% were asymptomatic. The prevalence of COVID19 in males was 56.29% and 43.20 % in females. The mean interval (SD) from symptom onset to diagnosis was 6-22.6 days while mean interval (SD) from contact to onset of symptoms was 5-19.5 days. People of age range 40-79 were more infected and deaths median age was 80. The main symptoms were fever, dry cough, fatigue and pneumonia. The main infected cities were Tokyo (195/1192, 16.35%), Hokkaido (160/1192 13.42%), Aichi (150/1192, 12.58%) and Osaka (145/1192, 12.16%).

However, research on farm animal intestinal epithelium has been hampered by the lack of appropriate in vitro models. Over the past decade, methods to culture livestock intestinal organoids have been developed in pig, bovine, rabbit, horse, sheep and chicken. Gut organoids from farm animals are obtained by seeding tissue-derived intestinal epithelial stem cells in a 3-dimensional culture environment reproducing in vitro the stem cell niche. These organoids can be generated rapidly within days and are formed by a monolayer of polarized epithelial cells containing the diverse differentiated epithelial progeny, recapitulating the original structure and function of the native epithelium. The phenotype of intestinal organoids is stable in long-term culture and reflects characteristics of the digestive segment of origin. Farm animal intestinal organoids can be amplified in vitro, cryopreserved and used for multiple experiments, allowing an efficient reduction of the use of live animals for experimentation. Most of the studies using livestock intestinal organoids were used to investigate host-microbe interactions at the epithelial surface, mainly focused on enteric infections with viruses, bacteria or parasites. Numerous other applications of farm animal intestinal organoids include studies on nutrient absorption, genome editing and bioactive compounds screening relevant for agricultural, veterinary and biomedical sciences. Further improvements of the methods used to culture intestinal organoids from farm animals are required to replicate more closely the intestinal tissue complexity, including the presence of non-epithelial cell types and of the gut microbiota. Harmonization of the methods used to culture livestock intestinal organoids will also be required to increase the reproducibility of the results obtained in these models. In this review, we summarize the methods used to generate and cryopreserve intestinal organoids in farm animals, present their phenotypes and discuss current and future applications of this innovative culture system of the digestive epithelium.","Beaumont, Martin; Blanc, Fany; Cherbuy, Claire; Egidy, Giorgia; Giuffra, Elisabetta; Lacroix-Lamandé, Sonia; Wiedemann, Agnès",Vet Res,24,20

This study pilots the use of an immersive virtual reality (VR) platform for defining objective observable behaviors as standards for evaluation of medical student recognition of impending respiratory failure. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted from July 2018-December 2019, evaluating student performance during a VR scenario of an infant in impending respiratory failure using the OculusRift™ VR platform. Video recordings were rated by two pair of physician reviewers blinded to student identity. One pair provided a consensus global assessment of performance (not competent, borderline, or competent) while the other used a checklist of observable behaviors to rate performance. Binary discriminant analysis was used to identify the observable behaviors that predicted the global assessment rating. RESULTS: Twenty-six fourth year medical students participated. Student performance of eight observable behaviors was found to be most predictive of a rating of competent, with a 91% probability. Correctly stating that the patient required an escalation of care had the largest contribution towards predicting a rating of competent, followed by commenting on the patient's increased heart rate, low oxygen saturation, increased respiratory rate, and stating that the patient was in respiratory distress. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that VR can be used to establish objective and observable performance standards for assessment of EPA attainment – a key step in moving towards competency based medical education.","Zackoff, Matthew W.; Young, Daniel; Sahay, Rashmi D.; Fei, Lin; Real, Francis J.; Guiot, Amy; Lehmann, Corinne; Klein, Melissa",Acad Pediatr,24,33

This study is aimed to evaluate the impact of increased coverage of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines by comparing the change of disease burden in the older population of Hong Kong, with the burden in the older population of Brisbane with relatively high vaccine coverage in the past fifteen years. METHODS: Time series segmented regression models were applied to weekly numbers of cause-specific mortality or hospitalization of Hong Kong and Brisbane. Annual excess rates of mortality or hospitalization associated with influenza in the older population were estimated for the pre-SARS (reference period), post-SARS and post-pandemic period, respectively. The rate ratios (RRs) between these periods were also calculated to assess the relative change of disease burden. RESULTS: Compared to the pre-SARS period, excess rates of mortality associated with influenza during the post-SARS period in Hong Kong decreased for cardiorespiratory diseases (RR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.80, 1.01), stroke (RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.50, 1.09), and ischemic heart diseases (RR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.34, 0.58). The corresponding RRs in Brisbane were 0.79 (95% CI 0.54, 1.15), 0.33 (0.13, 0.80), and 1.09 (0.62, 1.90), respectively. Only the mortality of ischemic heart diseases showed a greater reduction in Hong Kong than in Brisbane. During the post-pandemic period, excess rates of all-cause mortality increased in Hong Kong, but to a lesser extent than in Brisbane (RR = 1.41 vs 2.39). CONCLUSION: A relative decrease (or less of an increase) of influenza disease burden was observed in the older population of Hong Kong after increased coverage of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines in this population, as compared to those of Brisbane where vaccination rates remained stable. The lack of significant findings in some disease categories highlights the challenges of evaluating the benefits of vaccination at the population level.

The lockdown had a substantial environmental impact, because traffic pollution and industrial emissions are important factors affecting air quality and public health in the region. After the lockdown, the average monthly air quality index (AQI) in Wuhan was 59.7, which is 33.9% lower than that before the lockdown (January 23, 2020) and 47.5% lower than that during the corresponding period (113.6) from 2015 to 2019. Compared with the conditions before the lockdown, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) decreased by 36.9% and remained the main pollutant. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) showed the largest decrease of approximately 53.3%, and ozone (O3) increased by 116.6%. The proportions of fixed-source emissions and transported external-source emissions in this area increased. After the lockdown, O3 pollution was highly negatively correlated with the NO2 concentration, and the radiation increase caused by the PM2.5 reduction was not the main reason for the increase in O3. This indicates that the generation of secondary pollutants is influenced by multiple factors and is not only governed by emission reduction.","Lian, Xinbo; Huang, Jianping; Huang, Rujin; Liu, Chuwei; Wang, Lina; Zhang, Tinghan",Sci Total Environ,24,24

Methods: The study included all the cases reported from March 8 to May 31, 2020 in the state. Any person with history of international or domestic travel from high burden states, those presenting with Influenza-like or Severe Acute Respiratory Illness and high-risk contacts of COVID19 cases, who were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive were included. Detailed analysis based on contact tracing data available from line-list of the state surveillance unit was performed using cluster analysis software package. Findings: Amongst the 3404 COVID-19 positive cases, 3096 (91%) were asymptomatic while 308 (9%) were symptomatic. Majority of the asymptomatic cases were in the age range of 16-50 years while symptomatic cases were between 31-65 years. Most of those affected were males. Cluster analysis of 822 cases indicated that the secondary attack rate, size of the cluster (dispersion) and occurrence of overt clinical illness is significantly higher when the index case in a cluster was symptomatic compared to an asymptomatic. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that both asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases transmit the infection; however, the main driving force behind the spread of infection within the state was significantly higher from symptomatic cases. This has major implications for policies related to testing. Active search for symptomatic cases, subjecting them to testing and treatment should be prioritized for containing the spread of COVID-19.","Kumar, N.; Hameed, S. K. S.; Babu, G. R.; Venkataswamy, M.

An ability to triage patients was needed due to a sudden and massive increase in patients during the COVID-19 pandemic as healthcare providers incurred an exponential increase in workload, which created a strain on the staff and limited resources. Further, methods to better understand and characterise the predictors of morbidity and mortality was needed. METHODS: We developed a prediction model to predict patients at risk for mortality using only laboratory, vital and demographic information readily available in the electronic health record on more than 3395 hospital admissions with COVID-19. Multiple methods were applied, and final model was selected based on performance. A variable importance algorithm was used for interpretability, and understanding of performance and predictors was applied to the best model. We built a model with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 83–97 to identify predictors and patients with high risk of mortality due to COVID-19. Oximetry, respirations, blood urea nitrogen, lymphocyte per cent, calcium, troponin and neutrophil percentage were important features, and key ranges were identified that contributed to a 50% increase in patients’ mortality prediction score. With an increasing negative predictive value starting 0.90 after the second day of admission suggests we might be able to more confidently identify likely survivors DISCUSSION: This study serves as a use case of a machine learning methods with visualisations to aide clinicians with a better understanding of the model and predictors of mortality.

This study aims to improve the diagnosis of COVID-19 using computed tomography (CT). METHOD: COVID-19 was confirmed mainly by virus nucleic acid testing and epidemiological history according to WHO interim guidance, while other infectious pneumonias were diagnosed by antigen testing. The texture features were extracted from CT images by two radiologists with 5 years of work experience using modified wavelet transform and matrix computation analyses. The random forest (RF) classifier was applied to identify COVID-19 patients and images. RESULTS: We retrospectively analysed the data of 95 individuals (291 images) with COVID-19 and 96 individuals (279 images) with other acute infectious pneumonias, including 50 individuals (160 images) with influenza A/B. In total, 6 texture features showed a positive association with COVID-19, while 4 features were negatively associated. The mean AUROC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values of the 5-fold test sets were 0.800, 0.722, 0.770, and 0.680 for image classification and 0.858, 0.826, 0.809, and 0.842 for individual classification, respectively. The feature ‘Correlation’ contributed most both at the image level and individual level, even compared with the clinical factors. In addition, the texture features could discriminate COVID-19 from influenza A/B, with an AUROC of 0.883 for images and 0.957 for individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The developed texture feature-based RF classifier could assist in the diagnosis of COVID-19, which could be a rapid screening tool in the era of pandemic.","Wu, Zhiyuan; Li, Li; Jin, Ronghua; Liang, Lianchun; Hu, Zhongjie; Tao, Lixin; Han, Yong; Feng, Wei; Zhou, Di; Li, Weiming; Lu, Qinbin; Liu, Wei; Fang, Liqun; Huang, Jian; Gu, Yu; Li, Hongjun; Guo, Xiuhua",Eur J Radiol,24,16

The goal of this study was to determine the quality of those recommendations and provide suggestions to hospital managers for the adjustment of existing hospital prevention and control strategies, and also to offer recommendations for further research. DESIGN: A rapid review of the guidelines and consensuses for the management in paediatric wards facing COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, UpToDate, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Wanfang database and relevant websites such as medlive.cn, dxy.cn, the National Health and Health Commission and the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention were systematically searched through late May 2020. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) tool was then used to assess the quality of the selected articles and summarise the relevant evidence concerning management in paediatric wards. RESULTS: A total of 35 articles were included, composed of 3 consensus guidelines, 25 expert consensuses and 7 expert opinions. Of the 35 papers, 24 were from China, 2 from the USA, 1 from Spain, 1 from Brazil, 1 from Saudi Arabia and 6 from multinational cooperative studies. Scores for the six domains of the AGREE II tool (scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigour of development, clarity of presentation, applicability and editorial independence) were 98.57%, 53.57%, 17.92%, 69.62%, 26.96% and 50.35%, respectively. Recommendations for nosocomial infection and control, human resource management as well as management of paediatric patients and their families were summarised. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the quality of rapid guidelines and consensuses for the management in paediatric wards affected by COVID-19 is unsatisfactory. In the future, it will be necessary to develop more high-quality guidelines or consensuses for the management in paediatric wards to deal with nosocomial outbreaks in order to fully prepare for emergency medical and health problems.","Luo, Wen-Yi; Sun, Ji-Wen; Zhang, Wen-Lan; Li, Qian; Ni, Ping; Zhao, Lie-Bin; Tian, Jin-Hui; Zhang, Ya-Qing; Lu, Hong",BMJ Open,24,16

Modern clinical research features high complexity and requires a high workload for the management of trials-related activities, often hampering physicians’ participation to clinical trials. Dealing with children in clinical research adds complexity: rare diseases, parents or legal guardian reluctance to engage and recruitment difficulties are major reasons of pediatric trials failure. However, because in pediatrics many treatments are prescribed off-label or are lacking, well-designed clinical trials are particularly needed. Clinical Trial Units (CTUs) are indeed an important asset in the implementation of clinical trials, but their support to investigators is limited to administrative and non-clinical tasks. In this paper we present the model of the Investigational Clinical Center (ICC) of the Bambino Gesù Children’s Hospital in Rome. The ICC includes clinicians supporting the Principal Investigators for clinical management of enrolled patients in compliance of Good Clinical Practice, the legal framework of Clinical Trials. Furthermore, we present 10 years’ experience in pediatric clinical trials and how it has been affected in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic. The activity of the ICC has been evaluated according to specific metrics of performance. The ICC model offers a complete support, helping investigators, patients and their families to overcome majority of barriers linked to clinical research, even in time of pandemic. We propose this organization as an innovative model for total-supportive and patient-centered clinical trial implementation.

Other factors such as stress, poor husbandry and nutrition can also contribute to an animal's susceptibility to disease. Molecular biomarkers of production disease could be of immense value by improving diagnosis and risk analysis to determine best practice with an impact on increased economic output and animal welfare. In addition to the use of multiplex PCR or microarrays to detect individual or mixed pathogens during infection, these technologies can also be used to monitor the host response to infection via gene expression. The patterns of gene expression associated with cellular damage or initiation of the early immune response may indicate the type of pathology and, by extension the types of pathogen involved. Molecular methods can therefore be used to monitor both the presence of a pathogen and the host response to it during production disease. The field of biomarker discovery and implementation is expanding as technologies such as microarrays and next generation sequencing become more common. Whilst a large number of studies have been carried out in human medicine, further work is needed to identify molecular biomarkers in veterinary medicine and in particular those associated with production disease in the pig industry. The pig transcriptome is highly complex and still not fully understood. Further gene expression studies are needed to identify molecular biomarkers which may have predictive value in identifying the environmental, nutritional and other risk factors which are associated with production diseases in pigs.","Giles, Timothy A.; Belkhiri, Aouatif; Barrow, Paul A.; Foster, Neil",Res Vet Sci,24,1

Researchers from various disciplinary backgrounds (social to natural science, health and medicine, etc.) have studied different aspects of the pandemic. The current situation has revealed how the ongoing development of nanotechnology and nanomedicine can accelerate the fight against the novel viruses. A comprehensive solution to this and future pandemic outbreaks includes preventing the spread of the virus through anti-viral personal protective equipment (PPE) and anti-viral surfaces, plus efforts to encourage behavior to minimize risks. Studies of previously introduced anti-viral biomaterials and their optimization to fight against SARS-CoV-2 is the foundation of most of the recent progress. The identification of non-symptomatic patients and symptomatic patients is vital. Reviewing published research highlights the pivotal roles of nanotechnology and biomaterials in the development and efficiency of detection techniques, e.g., by applying nanotechnology and nanomedicine as part of the road map in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. In this review, we discuss efforts to deploy nanotechnology, biomaterials, and stem cells in each step of the fight against SARS-CoV-2, which may provide a framework for future efforts in combating global pandemics.","Ghaffari, Maryam; Mollazadeh-Bajestani, Maryam; Moztarzadeh, Fathollah; Uludağ, Hasan; Hardy, John G.; Mozafari, Masoud",Emergent Mater,24,1

Open online forums like Reddit provide an opportunity to quantitatively examine COVID-19 vaccine perceptions over time. We examine COVID-19 misinformation on Reddit following vaccine scientific announcements. Methods: We collected all posts on Reddit from January 1 2020 - December 14 2020 (n=266,840) that contained both COVID-19 and vaccine-related keywords. We used topic modeling to understand changes in word prevalence within topics after the release of vaccine trial data. Social network analysis was also conducted to determine the relationship between Reddit communities (subreddits) that shared COVID-19 vaccine posts, and the movement of posts between subreddits. Results: There was an association between a Pfizer press release reporting 90% efficacy and increased discussion on vaccine misinformation. We observed an association between Johnson and Johnson temporarily halting its vaccine trials and reduced misinformation. We found that information skeptical of vaccination was first posted in a subreddit (r/Coronavirus) which favored accurate information and then reposted in subreddits associated with antivaccine beliefs and conspiracy theories (e.g. conspiracy, LockdownSkepticism). Conclusions: Our findings can inform the development of interventions where individuals determine the accuracy of vaccine information, and communications campaigns to improve COVID-19 vaccine perceptions. Such efforts can increase individual- and population-level awareness of accurate and scientifically sound information regarding vaccines and thereby improve attitudes about vaccines.

STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study was conducted in 15 centers. Cases and controls were enrolled for a source population of children 3-15 years of age with acute viral infections between 2006 and 2009. RESULTS: Among 215 empyemas, 83 cases (children with empyema and acute viral infection within the 15 preceding days) were included, and 83 controls (children with acute viral infection) were matched to cases. Considering the intake of any drug within 72 hours after acute viral infection onset and at least 6 consecutive days of antibiotic use and at least 1 day of NSAIDs exposure, the multivariable analysis retained an increased risk of empyema associated with NSAIDs exposure (aOR 2.79, 95% CI 1.4-5.58, P = .004), and a decreased risk associated with antibiotic use (aOR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11-0.97, P = .04). The risk of empyema associated with NSAIDs exposure was greater for children not prescribed an antibiotic and antibiotic intake diminished that risk for children given NSAIDs. CONCLUSIONS: NSAIDs use during acute viral infection is associated with an increased risk of empyema in children, and antibiotics are associated with a decreased risk. The presence of antibiotic-NSAIDs interaction with this risk is suggested. These findings suggest that NSAIDs should not be recommended as a first-line antipyretic treatment during acute viral infections in children.","Le Bourgeois, Muriel; Ferroni, Agnès; Leruez-Ville, Marianne; Varon, Emmanuelle; Thumerelle, Caroline; Brémont, François; Fayon, Michael J.; Delacourt, Christophe; Ligier, Caroline; Watier, Laurence; Guillemot, Didier",J Pediatr,24,11

This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate if MAFLD or NAFLD are associated with a more severe disease course of COVID-19. Methods: A systematic search was performed in five databases for studies comparing severity, the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality of COVID-19 patients with and without MAFLD or NAFLD. In meta-analysis, pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: Altogether, we included nine studies in our quantitative and qualitative synthesis. MAFLD was associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 compared to the non-MAFLD group (28 vs. 13%, respectively; OR = 2.61, CI: 1.75–3.91). Similarly, in the NAFLD vs. non-NAFLD comparison, NAFLD proved to be a risk factor as well (36 vs. 12%, respectively; OR = 5.22, CI: 1.94–14.03). On the other hand, NAFLD was not associated with an increased risk of ICU admission (24 vs. 7%, respectively; OR = 2.29, CI: 0.79–6.63). We were unable to perform meta-analysis to investigate the association of MAFLD with the rate of ICU admission and with mortality. Conclusion: In conclusion, patients with MAFLD and NAFLD showed a more severe clinical picture in COVID-19. Our results support the importance of close monitoring of COVID-19 patients with MAFLD.

DESIGN: Retrospective. SETTING: Secondary care in four large Dutch hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who presented at the ED and were admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19. We used 5831 first-wave patients who presented between March and August 2020 for model development and 3252 second-wave patients who presented between September and December 2020 for model validation. OUTCOME MEASURES: We developed separate logistic regression models for in-hospital death and for need for ICU admission, both within 28 days after hospital admission. Based on prior literature, we considered quickly and objectively obtainable patient characteristics, vital parameters and blood test values as predictors. We assessed model performance by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and by calibration plots. RESULTS: Of 5831 first-wave patients, 629 (10.8%) died within 28 days after admission. ICU admission was fully recorded for 2633 first-wave patients in 2 hospitals, with 214 (8.1%) ICU admissions within 28 days. A simple model—COVID outcome prediction in the emergency department (COPE)—with age, respiratory rate, C reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, albumin and urea captured most of the ability to predict death. COPE was well calibrated and showed good discrimination for mortality in second-wave patients (AUC in four hospitals: 0.82 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.86); 0.82 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.90); 0.79 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.88); 0.83 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.86)).

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Northwestern Memorial Hospital ICUs. PATIENTS: All patients intubated for coronavirus disease 2019 between March 2020 and June 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were stratified by time to intubation: 30 subjects were intubated 4–24 hours after presentation and 24 subjects were intubated 5–10 days after presentation. Baseline characteristics, hospitalization, ventilator mechanics, and outcomes were extracted and analyzed. Ten clinically available CT scans were manually reviewed to identify evidence of pulmonary vascular thrombosis and intussusceptive angiogenesis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Median time from symptom onset to intubation was significantly different between the early and late intubation cohorts, with the latter being intubated later in the course of their illness (7.9 vs 11.8 d; p = 0.04). The early intubation cohort had a lower mortality rate than the late intubation cohort (6% vs 30%, p < 0.001) without significantly different respiratory mechanics at the time of intubation. The late intubation cohort was noted to have higher dead space ratio (0.40 vs 0.52; p = 0.03). On review of CT scans, the late intubation cohort also had more dilated peripheral segments on imaging (two segments vs five segments). CONCLUSIONS: The question as to whether delaying intubation is beneficial or harmful for patients with coronavirus disease 2019-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure has yet to be answered. As our approaches to coronavirus disease 2019 continue to evolve, the decision of timing of intubation remains paramount. Although noninvasive ventilation may allow for delaying intubation, it is possible that there are downstream effects of delayed intubation that should be considered, including the potential for pulmonary vascular thrombosis and intussusceptive angiogenesis with delayed intubation.","Bavishi, Avni A.; Mylvaganam, Ruben J.; Agarwal, Rishi; Avery, Ryan J.; Cuttica, Michael J.",Crit Care Explor,24,16

Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies that included cohort of patients infected with SARSCOV2 from December 1st, 2019 to July 1st, 2020. We collected data from the cohort of patients with COVID19 by conducting a literature search using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane according to the preferred reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We analyzed pooled data on the prevalence of overall and individual gastrointestinal symptoms, LFTs abnormalities and performed subanalyses to investigate the relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms, geographic location, fatality, and ICU admission. Results The available data of 17,802 positive patients for SARS-COV2 from 120 studies were included in our analysis. The most frequent manifestations were diarrhea, nauseated elevated LFTs. The overall and GI fatality were 7.2% , and 1% respectively. Subgroup analysis showed non statistically significant associations between GI symptoms/LFTs abnormalities and ICU admissions (OR=3.41, 95%). The GI mortality rate was 0.58% in China and 3.5% in the United States. Conclusion Digestive symptoms and LFTs abnormalities are common in COVID-19 patients.

Rapid implementation was facilitated by staff commitment and communication among stakeholders, but hampered by limitations with guidance received, physical environments, resources, parental adherence and balancing preventive measures with learning. Difficulties with distancing for younger children suggest that smaller bubbles with fewer distancing requirements within these may be a policy option. Schools require further financial, human resource and other support for effective implementation of preventive measures.","Sundaram, Neisha; Bonell, Chris; Ladhani, Shamez; Langan, Sinéad M; Baawuah, Frances; Okike, Ifeanychukwu; Ahmad, Shazaad; Beckmann, Joanne; Garstang, Joanna; Brent, Bernadette E; Brent, Andrew J; Amin-Chowdhury, Zahin; Aiano, Felicity; Hargreaves, James",Health Educ Res,24,22

However, its physiological role is much larger and encompasses very different processes ranging from facilitation of iron absorption through involvement in hormones and carnitine synthesis for important roles in epigenetic processes. Contrarily, high doses act as a pro-oxidant than an anti-oxidant. This may also be the reason why plasma levels are meticulously regulated on the level of absorption and excretion in the kidney. Interestingly, most cells contain vitamin C in millimolar concentrations, which is much higher than its plasma concentrations, and compared to other vitamins. The role of vitamin C is well demonstrated by miscellaneous symptoms of its absence—scurvy. The only clinically well-documented indication for vitamin C is scurvy. The effects of vitamin C administration on cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and infections are rather minor or even debatable in the general population. Vitamin C is relatively safe, but caution should be given to the administration of high doses, which can cause overt side effects in some susceptible patients (e.g., oxalate renal stones). Lastly, analytical methods for its determination with advantages and pitfalls are also discussed in this review.","Doseděl, Martin; Jirkovský, Eduard; Macáková, Kateřina; Krčmová, Lenka Kujovská; Javorská, Lenka; Pourová, Jana; Mercolini, Laura; Remião, Fernando; Nováková, Lucie; Mladěnka, Přemysl",Nutrients,24,3

Study Design and Methods Patients with COVID-19 from 19 designated hospitals between January 1 to February 29, 2020 were included, and the main exposure of interest was administration of thymosin α1. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to account for baseline confounders, cluster analysis and Cox proportional hazard model was used to account for subgroup analysis. Results A total of 771 patients were included, and 327/771 (42.4%) patients received thymosin α1 therapy. The 28-day mortality in thymosin group was significantly lower than that in control group (41.3% vs. 60.6%, p<0.001). After PSM 522 patients were included in analysis and the 28-day mortality in thymosin α1 group and control group were 51.0% and 52.9% respectively, with no significant difference. In subgroup analyses, the association between thymosin α1 therapy and 28-day mortality appeared to be stronger among male patients (HR 0.673, 95% CI 0.454-0.998; p=0.049). There were no benefits of thymosin α1 in 28-day mortality in other subgroups. There were two phenotypes after cluster analysis, but no benefits of thymosin α1 were shown in phenotype 1 (HR 0.823 95% CI 0.581-1.166; p=0.273) and phenotype 2 (HR 1.148 95% CI 0.710-1.895; p=0.442). Conclusion There was no association between use of thymosin α1 and decreased mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Subgroups analysis and phenotype analysis also showed no differences on mortality after thymosin α1 therapy.","Sun, Qin; Xie, Jianfeng; Zheng, Ruiqiang; Li, Xuyan; Chen, Hui; Tong, Zhaohui; Du, Bin; Qiu, Haibo; Yang, Yi",Int Immunopharmacol,24,1

An internet‐mediated research (IMR) approach is used to investigate the effectiveness of using technology and translational research as strategies for disseminating a rapidly produced digital guide, for promoting play‐based learning at home, to parents. Lockdown with the closure of early years provision led to parents finding themselves isolated at home with young children. Early years educators were managing a unique set of circumstances where communication with families, including those ‘harder‐to‐reach’ was contextually problematic. Qualitative data using IMR captured online interactions by unobtrusive and obtrusive methods; unsolicited emails and social media comments and questionnaire responses. Conventional content analysis identified emerging themes of access, availability, reliability and readability. Analysis showed a combination of factors impacted on the speed and scale of sharing and downloading the digital guide. First, being digitally ready as platforms were already used by early years educators and Local Authorities. Second, the professional drive of Local Authorities and early years educators to support families during the crisis and third, the availability of an easily accessible online resource seen as valuable in improving play‐based learning at home. PRACTITIONER NOTES: There are high levels of digital readiness in the United Kingdom. Technology is one method used by early years settings to communicate with parents. Parental engagement is challenging. A translational research strategy (to share research‐informed‐knowledge with stakeholders) and internet‐mediated research (to gather data from stakeholders) combine effectively for use within the early years sector to disseminate research knowledge to parents and support home learning environments. The high levels of technology readiness of early years educators and parents in England provides opportunities for disseminating information and improving home learning environments. Accessing and sharing documents online may involve parents but is insufficient to engage. : Early years settings need to be more proactive in engaging with parents online. Technology provides opportunities to develop interaction and the sharing of information with parents. Digital media should be used as additional communication strategies and should not replace the fundamental importance of face‐to‐face‐interaction.","Laxton, Debra; Cooper, Linda; Younie, Sarah",Br J Educ Technol,24,22

Many studies showed that the prevalence of back pain after spinal anesthesia is high and its magnitude is considerable in developing countries. It is highly related to reduced quality of life, loss of work productivity, burden of health care costs, and satisfaction regarding health care service; therefore, measures should be taken to reduce or prevented postspinal back. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the prevalence and factors associated with back pain among patients undergoing spinal anesthesia at the University of Gondar Comprehensive and Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. Methodology. An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from March to May 2020. A total of 215 participants were enrolled in this study. A convenience sampling technique was used to get the study participants. Both univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with postspinal back pain. Variables with a p value less than <0.2 in the bivariable analysis were fitted into the multivariable analysis. In the multivariable analysis, a variable with a p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of postspinal back pain was 40.5% (95% CI: 34.0, 47.4). Being overweight (AOR = 3.8; 95% CI: 1.47, 9.96) and obese (AOR = 4.9; 95% CI: 1.19, 20.4), using big spinal needles (AOR = 5.9; 95% CI: 1.04, 33.4), two attempts of lumbar puncture (AOR = 5.5; 95% CI: 1.74, 17.59), more than three attempts of lumbar puncture (AOR = 4.9; 95% CI: 1.63, 15.2), and the number of bone contacts during spinal anesthesia procedure (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI: 1.14, 8.45) were positively associated with postspinal back pain. Conclusion and Recommendation. The overall incidence of back pain is high. Body mass index, size of spinal needle, number of attempts, and number of bone contacts are significantly associated with the incidence of back pain following spinal anesthesia. Thus, it is better to minimize the number of lumbar puncture attempts and bone contacts during spinal anesthesia to reduce postspinal back pain. In addition, using smaller size spinal needle is a good choice.","Zeleke, Tadael Gudayu; Mersha, Abraham Tarekegn; Endalew, Nigussie Simeneh; Ferede, Yonas Admasu",Adv Med,24,1

Had some countries been better prepared than others? This paper attempts to shed light on these questions by examining the role of climate risk and culture in explaining the cross-country variation in the Covid-19 mortality, while controlling for other potential drivers. In our analysis, we consider climate risk, readiness to climate change and individualism as main indicators reflecting the climate and culture status of individual countries. Using data from 110 countries, we find that the greater the climate risk; the lower the readiness to climate change and the more individualistic the society, the higher the pandemic mortality rate. We also present a series of sensitivity checks and show that our findings are robust to different specifications, alternative definitions of the mortality rate; and different estimation methods. One policy implication arising from our results is that countries that were better prepared for the climate emergency were also better placed to fight the pandemic. Overall, countries in which individuals look after each other and the environment, creating sustainable societies, are better able to cope with climate and public health emergencies.","Ozkan, Aydin; Ozkan, Gulcin; Yalaman, Abdullah; Yildiz, Yilmaz",World Dev,24,27

The disease has rapidly acquired a pandemic status affecting almost all populated areas of the planet. The causative agent of COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. The virus has an approximate 30 kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome, which is 74.5% to 99% identical to that of SARS-CoV, CoV-pangolin, and the coronavirus the from horseshoe bat. According to available information, SARS-CoV-2 is inferred to be a recombinant virus that originated from bats and was transmitted to humans, possibly using the pangolin as the intermediate host. The interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor, and its subsequent cleavage by serine protease and fusion, are the main events in the pathophysiology.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify admission laboratory and comorbidity features associated with critical illness and mortality risk across 6 Eastern Massachusetts hospitals. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using hospital course, prior diagnoses, and laboratory values. SETTING: Emergency department and inpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 4 community hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: All individuals with hospital admission and positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by PCR testing across these 6 hospitals through June 5, 2020. EXPOSURE: Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Severe illness defined by ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS: Among 2,511 hospitalized individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (of whom 50.9% were male, 53.9% white, and 27.0% Hispanic, with mean age 62.6 years), 215 (8.6%) were admitted to the ICU, 164 (6.5%) required mechanical ventilation, and 292 (11.6%) died.

RNase L restricts viral infections by degrading viral and cellular RNA, inducing autophagy and apoptosis, and producing RNA degradation products that amplify production of type I interferons (IFNs) through RIG-I-like receptors. However, the effects of the OAS/RNase L pathway on IFN induction in different cell types that vary in basal levels of these proteins have not been previously reported. Here we report higher basal expression of both RNase L and OAS in mouse macrophages in comparison to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In MEFs, RNase L gene knockout decreased induction of IFN-β by encephalomyocarditis virus infection or poly(rI):poly(rC) (pIC) transfection. In contrast, in macrophages, RNase L deletion increased (rather than decreased) induction of IFN-β by virus or pIC. RNA damage from RNase L in virus-infected macrophages is likely responsible for reducing IFN-β production. Similarly, direct activation of RNase L by transfection with 2-5A induced IFN-β in MEFs but not in macrophages. Also, viral infection or pIC transfection caused RNase L-dependent apoptosis of macrophages but not of MEFs. Our results suggest that cell-type-specific differences in basal levels of OAS and RNase L are determinants of IFN-β induction that could affect tissue protection and survival during viral infections.","Banerjee, Shuvojit; Chakrabarti, Arindam; Jha, Babal Kant; Weiss, Susan R.; Silverman, Robert H.",mBio,24,20

While gender remains a key determinant of health, attempts to address the gendered dimensions of health face complex challenges. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study 482 participants (men=237, women=245) completed questionnaires on precautionary behaviour, perceived knowledge about COVID-19 risk factors, emotional reactions toward COVID-19 and perceived susceptibility. We examined gender differences in perceived knowledge about COVID-19 risk factors, healthy behaviours, threat perceptions and emotional responses, as well as the role of gender as a moderating factor. RESULTS: Women reported higher levels of precautionary behaviour (t(475)=3.91, p<0.001) and more negative emotional reactions toward COVID-19 (t(475)=6.07, p<0.001). No gender differences emerged in perceived susceptibility or knowledge about COVID-19. The multiple regression model is significant and explains 30% of the variance in precautionary behaviour, which was found to be higher among women and older participants, those with higher perceived knowledge about COVID-19 risk factors and those with higher emotional reactions. Gender exhibited a significant moderating role in the relationship between perceived knowledge and precautionary behaviour (B=0.16, SE=0.07, β=0.13, p=0.02, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.30).

Many researchers have expressed their conclusions from different perspectives on various factors such as spatial changes, climate risks, preparedness, blood type, age and comorbidities that may be contributing to COVID-19 mortality rate. However, as the number of people coming to the hospital for COVID-19 treatment increases, the mortality rate is likely to increase due to the lack of medical facilities. In order to provide medical assistance in this situation, we need to consider not only the extent of the disease impact, but also other important factors. No method has yet been proposed to calculate the priority of patients taking into account all the factors. We have provided a solution to this in this research article. Based on eight key factors, we provide a way to determine priorities. In order to achieve the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method, we studied individuals with different results on all factors. The sigmoid function helps to easily construct factors at different levels. In addition, the Cobweb solution model allows us to see the potential of our proposed algorithm very clearly. Using the method we introduced, it is easier to sort high-risk individuals to low-risk individuals. This will make it easier to deal with problems that arise when the number of patients in hospitals continues to increase. It can reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients.

Both SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and persistent infection have been described, but a systematic assessment of mutations is needed. We assessed sequences from published cases of COVID-19 reinfection and persistence, characterizing the hallmarks of reinfecting sequences and the rate of viral evolution in persistent infection. Methods. A systematic review of PubMed was conducted to identify cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and persistent infection with available sequences. Amino acid changes in the reinfecting sequence were compared to both the initial and contemporaneous community variants. Time-measured phylogenetic reconstruction was performed to compare intra-host viral evolution in persistent COVID-19 to community-driven evolution. Results. Fourteen reinfection and five persistent infection cases were identified. Reports of reinfection cases spanned a broad distribution of ages, baseline health status, reinfection severity, and occurred as early as 1.5 months or >8 months after the initial infection. The reinfecting viral sequences had a median of 9 amino acid changes with enrichment of changes in the S, ORF8 and N genes. The number of amino acid changes did not differ by the severity of reinfection and reinfecting variants were similar to the contemporaneous sequences circulating in the community. Patients with persistent COVID-19 demonstrated more rapid accumulation of mutations than seen with community-driven evolution with continued viral changes during convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibody treatment. Conclusions. SARS-CoV-2 reinfection does not require an unusual set of circumstances in the host or virus, while persistent COVID-19 is largely described in immunosuppressed individuals and is associated with accelerated viral evolution as measured by clock rates.","Choudhary, M.

METHODS: The data were extracted from National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, Health Commission of Guizhou province, and Health Commission of Hubei province from January 20 to February 12, 2020. Information included such as general demographic indicators, population data and clinical outcome. RESULTS: A total of 135 cases were analyzed in the study. The average age was 39.46±18.95 years. The ratio of males to females was 0.985:1. Most of COVID-19 patients were 18-45 years old (52.27%). Close contact history was the most common (37.88%), followed by residence history in Hubei (34.85%). There was no difference between males and females in age (P=0.953) and exposure condition (P=0.186). Correlation analysis showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the migration index and the number of confirmed cases (r=0.816, P=0.007). CONCLUSION: Among the cases, most patients were young adults. Most epidemiological characteristics were no difference between males and females. Family-based transmission should not be ignored, as a close contact history was the top reason of exposure. Moreover, population movements also had significant impact on outbreaks.","Li, Xiahong; Wang, Xue; Liu, Jun; Huang, Guangtao; Shi, Xiuquan",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,24,22

Vocal cord paralysis with no clear cause is termed as idiopathic vocal cord paralysis and supposed to be caused by viral infection. This is a case series study; data were collected prospectively from patients presented to the ENT clinic of Kasr Alainy (Cairo university) and Railway hospitals. Patients presented with defective vocal cord movement with concurrently or recently passed COVID-19 infection were reported from March 2020 to April 2021. RESULTS: Authors have reported 6 cases of vocal cord paralysis mainly unilateral due to COVID-19 infection as an only clear cause within 14 months. Age ranges from 39 to 69 years, 2 males and 4 females. Patients presented with different clinical scenarios. Follow-up of the cases showed spontaneous recovery in 5 cases and one case underwent cord medialization. CONCLUSION: Viral infection could be an underlying cause of idiopathic laryngeal cord paralysis; in the new era of the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians all over the world noticed variable neurological pictures; in this study, we presented 6 cases of vocal cord paralysis mainly unilateral supposed to be due to COVID-19 infection; all cases showed spontaneous recovery apart from one case that needed medialization of the cord.","Zamzam, Sameh M.; Hanafy, Rania Gamal",Egypt J Otolaryngol,24,16

A simple molecular method for rapid detection of ERG11 gene mutations would be an advantage as a screening tool to identify potentially-resistant strains and to track their movement. To complement DNA sequencing, we developed a padlock probe and rolling circle amplification (RCA)-based method to detect a series of mutations in the C. albicans ERG11 gene using ""reference"" azole-resistant isolates with known mutations. The method was then used to estimate the frequency of ERG11 mutations and their type in 25 Australian clinical C. albicans isolates with reduced susceptibility to fluconazole and in 23 fluconazole-susceptible isolates. RCA results were compared DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The RCA assay correctly identified all ERG11 mutations in eight ""reference"" C. albicans isolates. When applied to 48 test strains, the RCA method showed 100% agreement with DNA sequencing where an ERG11 mutation-specific probe was used. Of 20 different missense mutations detected by sequencing in 24 of 25 (96%) isolates with reduced fluconazole susceptibility, 16 were detected by RCA. Five missense mutations were detected by both methods in 18 of 23 (78%) fluconazole-susceptible strains. DNA sequencing revealed that mutations in non-susceptible isolates were all due to homozygous nucleotide changes. With the exception of the mutations leading to amino acid substitution E266D, those in fluconazole-susceptible strains were heterozygous. Amino acid substitutions common to both sets of isolates were D116E, E266D, K128T, V437I and V488I. Substitutions unique to isolates with reduced fluconazole susceptibility were G464 S (n = 4 isolates), G448E (n = 3), G307S (n = 3), K143R (n = 3) and Y123H, S405F and R467K (each n = 1). DNA sequencing revealed a novel substitution, G450V, in one isolate. CONCLUSION: The sensitive RCA assay described here is a simple, robust and rapid (2 h) method for the detection of ERG11 polymorphisms. It showed excellent concordance with ERG11 sequencing and is a potentially valuable tool to track the emergence and spread of azole-resistant C. albicans and to study the epidemiology of ERG11 mutations. The RCA method is applicable to the study of azole resistance in other fungi.","Wang, Huiping; Kong, Fanrong; Sorrell, Tania C; Wang, Bin; McNicholas, Paul; Pantarat, Namfon; Ellis, David; Xiao, Meng; Widmer, Fred; Chen, Sharon CA",BMC Microbiol,24,1

It measures the average number of people that will be infected by a single contagious individual. A value of Reff > 1 suggests that an outbreak will occur, while Reff< 1 suggests the virus will die out. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries worldwide are implementing a range of intervention measures, such as population-wide social distancing and case isolation, with the goal of reducing Reff to values below one, to slow or eliminate transmission. We analyse case data from 25 international locations to estimate their Reff values over time and to assess the effectiveness of interventions, equivalent to New Zealand's Alert Levels 1-4, for reducing transmission. Our results show that strong interventions, equivalent to NZ's Alert Level 3 or 4, have been successful at reducing Reff below the threshold for outbreak. In general, countries that implemented strong interventions earlier in their outbreak have managed to maintain case numbers at lower levels. These estimates provide indicative ranges of Reff for each Alert Level, to inform parameters in models of COVID-19 spread under different intervention scenarios in New Zealand and worldwide. Predictions from such models are important for informing policy and decisions on intervention timing and stringency during the pandemic.","Binny, R. N.; Hendy, S. C.; James, A.; Lustig, A.; Plank, M.

The viral membrane of SARS-CoV-2 surrounds a helical nucleocapsid in which the viral genome is encapsulated by the nucleocapsid protein. The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is produced at high levels within infected cells, enhances the efficiency of viral RNA transcription and is essential for viral replication. Here we show that RNA induces cooperative liquid-liquid phase separation of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. In agreement with its ability to phase separate in vitro, we show that the protein associates in cells with stress granules, cytoplasmic RNA/protein granules that form through liquid-liquid phase separation and are modulated by viruses to maximize replication efficiency. Liquid-liquid phase separation generates high-density protein/RNA condensates that recruit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex of SARS-CoV-2 providing a mechanism for efficient transcription of viral RNA. Inhibition of RNA-induced phase separation of the nucleocapsid protein by small molecules or biologics thus can interfere with a key step in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.","Savastano, Adriana; de Opakua, Alain Ibáñez; Rankovic, Marija; Zweckstetter, Markus",bioRxiv,24,20

Methods: Records of hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 1 March to 31 May 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Of 283 patients, AKI occurred in 40.6%. From multivariate analyses, the risk factors of AKI in COVID-19 can be divided into: (1) demographics/co-morbidities (male, increasing age, diabetes, chronic kidney disease); (2) other organ involvements (transaminitis, elevated troponin I, ST segment/T wave change on electrocardiography); (3) elevated biomarkers (ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase); (4) possible bacterial co-infection (leukocytosis, elevated procalcitonin); (5) need for advanced oxygen delivery (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, mechanical ventilation); and (6) other critical features (ICU admission, need for vasopressors, acute respiratory distress syndrome). Most AKIs were due to pre-renal (70.4%) and intrinsic (34.8%) causes. Renal replacement therapy was more common in intrinsic AKI. Both pre-renal (HR 3.2; 95% CI 1.7–5.9) and intrinsic AKI (HR 7.7; 95% CI 3.6–16.3) were associated with higher mortality.

Hence, we provide here a clinical example demonstrating that immune response could be associated with increased glucose metabolism in lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes and the spleen, which are critical modulators of T cell immunity. We believe that it is of paramount importance that nuclear physicians should be able to recognize clinical and imaging features of such immune responses upon vaccination for COVID-19 and beyond.","Seban, Romain-David; Champion, Laurence; Deleval, Nicolas; Richard, Capucine; Provost, Claire",Diagnostics (Basel),24,20

Determining which patients are at high risk of severe illness or mortality is essential for appropriate clinical decision making. We propose a novel severity score specifically for COVID-19 to help predict disease severity and mortality. 4711 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. We derived a risk model using the first half of the cohort (n = 2355 patients) by logistic regression and bootstrapping methods. The discriminative power of the risk model was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). The severity score was validated in a second half of 2356 patients. Mortality incidence was 26.4% in the derivation cohort and 22.4% in the validation cohort. A COVID-19 severity score ranging from 0 to 10, consisting of age, oxygen saturation, mean arterial pressure, blood urea nitrogen, C-Reactive protein, and the international normalized ratio was developed. A ROC curve analysis was performed in the derivation cohort achieved an AUC of 0.824 (95% CI 0.814–0.851) and an AUC of 0.798 (95% CI 0.789–0.818) in the validation cohort. Furthermore, based on the risk categorization the probability of mortality was 11.8%, 39% and 78% for patient with low (0–3), moderate (4–6) and high (7–10) COVID-19 severity score. This developed and validated novel COVID-19 severity score will aid physicians in predicting mortality during surge periods.","Altschul, David J.; Unda, Santiago R.; Benton, Joshua; de la Garza Ramos, Rafael; Cezayirli, Phillip; Mehler, Mark; Eskandar, Emad N.",Sci Rep,24,32

When the COVID-19 pandemic let to closure of medical schools in these countries, the Bhutanese medical students were repatriated in March-April 2020. Upon return, they were kept in government-sponsored facility quarantine for 21 days. This study assessed their knowledge on COVID-19 as a part of self-learning and attitude as part of preparedness towards participation in government's health response to COVID-19. Method: This was a cross-sectional study among medical students who had returned to the country. This survey was conducted through an online questionnaire while the students were in 21-day facility quarantine. The sample size calculated was 129 and a convenient sampling was used. Knowledge was assessed using 20 questions, each scored 1/20. Cumulative score of score of >=80% was categorized as ""good knowledge"", score of >=60-79% was considered ""satisfactory knowledge"", and score <60% was considered ""poor knowledge."" Correlation between knowledge score and duration of clinical clerkship was tested using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Attitude of students towards their willingness to participate in the national COVID-19 response were tested using rating scales. Data were analysed using Stata 13.1. Results: 120 medical students responded to this survey (response rate = 93%). Eighty-eight (74%) had good knowledge, 28 (23%) had satisfactory knowledge and only four (3%) had poor knowledge on COVID-19. The students scored high on the symptomatology, mode of transmission, prevention and treatment options and on local epidemiology; and scored low on the forms of mechanical ventilations and on the home-management of non-critical cases. The knowledge score correlated with duration of clinical clerkship (r = 0.326, p = 0.001). The primary source of information were social media sites (102, 85%), television (94, 78%) and newspapers (76, 63%). The majority (78, 65%) were willing to participate in the government's COVID-19 response but could not identify what roles they could play. The fear of contracting COVID-19 was reported in only in 8.7%. Conclusions: The medical students had good knowledge on COVID-19 and were self-learned through social media, television and newspapers. The students held positive attitude towards participation in the government's COVID-19 response.","Dorji, T.; Tamang, S. T.; Tilak, T.",,24,1

Methods Large entities that support chiropractic education or practice were invited to participate in this report. Leaders of various entities were emailed an invitation. A designee who was assigned by the leader provided a brief synopsis of actions the entity had taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Only entities that responded are included in this report. Results Five entities agreed to participate: The Council on Chiropractic Education, Association of Chiropractic Colleges, Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards, National Board of Chiropractic Examiners, and the NCMIC. Common themes included (1) recognizing the crisis and taking action; (2) establishing a safe working environment for staff so that services could continue; (3) delivering communications to stakeholders (chiropractic students, practitioners, licensing boards, and others) to guide decisions and direct actions; and (4) continuing to monitor the situation and respond as new information becomes available. Conclusion These entities serve a large portion of the chiropractic profession. They have been quick to respond in a responsible, compassionate, and supportive manner to assist chiropractic licensing boards, practitioners, and students during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings are encouraging as the chiropractic profession looks to the future as it navigates changes in education and the healthcare environment in the months and years ahead.","Johnson, Claire D.; Little, Craig S.; Sterling, Tamara A.; Gojkovich, Scott; Boghosian, Karlos; Ciolfi, Michael A.",J Manipulative Physiol Ther,24,20

The incidence of this syndrome appears to mirror the initial infectious assault, with a delay of several weeks. This syndrome has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and is observed in association with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The phenotypes of presentation include several characteristic features, including prolonged fever, eruption, neck stiffness and gastrointestinal manifestations with pronounced abdominal pain. Shock and organ dysfunction on presentation are frequently but inconsistent, while respiratory distress is typically, and notably, absent. We have reviewed recently published data aiming to better understanding MIS-C, with a focus on its mucocutaneous manifestations. • Mucocutaneous manifestations of MIS-C: conjunctivitis, oral mucosal changes, rash. • The rash of MIS-C is typically diffuse and non-specific. • Mucocutaneous manifestations of MIS-C are more common in younger children. • KD and MIS-C differ in mean age of onset, race predilection, and associated symptoms.","Naka, Fludiona; Melnick, Laura; Gorelik, Mark; Morel, Kimberly D.",Clin Dermatol,24,16

However, evidence is lacking on combination therapies of antiviral agents and systemic corticosteroids. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of favipiravir and methylprednisolone in preventing respiratory failure progression in patients with COVID-19 and non-critical respiratory failure. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase II study. The patients received favipiravir 3600 mg on the first day, followed by 1600 mg for a total of 10–14 days. Methylprednisolone was administered intravenously at 1 mg/ideal body weight (IBW)/day from days 1 to 5, followed by 0.5 mg/IBW/day from days 6 to 10 if clinically indicated. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) (including noninvasive positive pressure ventilation) or those who met the criteria for tracheal intubation within 14 days of the study treatment initiation (MVCTI-14). RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were enrolled and underwent the study treatment. Of them, the MVCTI-14 proportion was 29.2% (90% confidence interval 20.1–39.9, p = 0.200). The proportion of patients who required MV or who died within 30 days was 26.2%, and 30-day mortality was 4.9%. The most significant risk factor for MVCTI-14 was a smoking history (odds ratio 4.1, 95% confidence interval 1.2–14.2). The most common grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse event was hyperglycemia, which was observed in 21.7%. CONCLUSION: The MVCTI-14 proportion did not reach a favorable level in the clinical trial setting with the threshold of 35%. However, the proportion of MV or death within 30 days was 26.6%, which might be close to the findings (28.1%) of the RECOVERY trial, which showed the efficacy of dexamethasone for patients with COVID-19 and non-critical respiratory failure. Further evaluation of this combination therapy is needed. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCT) identifier jRCTs041200025.

The aim of this umbrella review of meta-analyses is to determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using relevant keywords, data resources including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, ProQuest, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Embase were searched to obtain systematic reviews and meta-analyses reporting the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic from the beginning of January to the end of October 2020. The random effects model was used for meta-analysis, and the I(2) index was employed to assess heterogeneity among studies. Data was analyzed using STATA 14 software. RESULTS: In the primary search, 103 studies were identified, and ultimately 7 studies were included in the umbrella review. The results showed that the overall prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic was 24.94% (95% CI: 21.83–28.05, I(2) = 0.0%, P = 0.804) and 24.83% (95% CI: 21.41–28.25, I(2) = 0.0%, P = 0.897), respectively. CONCLUSION: This umbrella review shows that the prevalence of anxiety and depression is relatively high among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this study, we examined knowledge of SPs and IC among clinical students attending the King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we targeted clinical students from the following five colleges: Medicine (fifth and sixth years); Dentistry (second semester of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth years); Applied Medical Sciences (third and fourth years); Nursing (third and fourth years); and Pharmacy (third, fourth, and fifth years). The data collection instrument was an adopted 41-item questionnaire that measured knowledge of SPs and IC in five domains. A score of ≥24 (60%) indicated sufficient knowledge. RESULTS: The participants comprised 129 students (67 men). The proportions of participants from each college were: Medicine, 58.1% (n = 75); Dentistry, 14% (n = 18); Applied Medical Sciences, 13.2% (n = 17); Nursing, 10.9% (n = 14); and Pharmacy, 3.9% (n = 5). Most students (73.6%) demonstrated sufficient knowledge (men, 67.2% and women, 80.6%). The highest scores were obtained for the domains “general concept of SPs”, “hand hygiene”, and “personal protective equipment”, whereas the lowest scores were obtained for “disposal of and injuries from sharp objects” and “health-care providers’ care”. The main information source was formal curricular teaching. CONCLUSIONS: In Saudi Arabia, students’ knowledge of SPs and IC is satisfactory, with no significant differences between the sexes or between colleges. Thus, formal curricular teaching is an effective way to increase students’ knowledge of SPs and IC.","Khubrani, Abdullah; Albesher, Meshal; Alkahtani, Abdulah; Alamri, Faisal; Alshamrani, Majid; Masuadi, Emad",J Infect Public Health,24,1

In addition, information for three case studies is reported, with crucial learnings to inform future response. Findings from this study suggest that as early as 20 January 2020, Vietnam held a national risk assessment, established a national COVID-19 Response Plan and Technical Treatment and Care Guidelines, and prepared public health laboratories to accurately diagnose cases and hospitals to effectively treat patients. The first COVID-19 case was detected on 23 January. As of 30 September, there had been three waves of the COVID-19 epidemic totalling 1095 cases, and resulting in 35 deaths all among people with underlying health conditions. Evidence of potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from a commercial passenger flight inbound to Vietnam was reported. This study also highlights the importance of early technical preparedness, strong political commitment, multisectoral and multilevel efforts, increased resourcing and coordination towards an effective COVID-19 response. Controlling outbreaks in settings, such as crowded public places (bars and hospitals), within certain villages and over cities, required early detection, aggressive trace-test-quarantine efforts, a geographically extensive lockdown area and an adoption of several non-pharmaceutical interventions. Many low-income and middle-income countries have experienced their second or third wave of the COVID-19 epidemic, and they can learn from Vietnam’s response across the three epidemic waves. Swift governmental action, strict border control measures, effective communication of health promotion measures, widespread community engagement, expanded testing capacity and effective social measures to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, are highly important in these locations.","Nguyen, Thuong Vu; Tran, Quang Dai; Phan, Lan Trong; Vu, Long Ngoc; Truong, Dung Thi Thuy; Truong, Hieu Cong; Le, Tu Ngoc; Vien, Linh Dang Khanh; Nguyen, Thinh Viet; Luong, Quang Chan; Pham, Quang Duy",BMJ Glob Health,24,20

The occurrence of several deleterious events, such as hyperactivation of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), and oxidative and inflammatory stress, contributes to the development of small vessel disease in PAH. Small resistance arteries are found at various points through the arterial tree, act as the major site of vascular resistance, and actively regulate local tissue perfusion. Experimental and clinical studies demonstrate that alterations in small resistance artery properties are important features of PAH pathophysiology. Diseased small vessels in PAH show decreased lumens, thicker walls, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress and inflammation. These events may lead to altered blood flow supply to tissues and organs, and can increase the risk of thrombosis. Notably, PAH is prevalent among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, in whom evidence of small vessel disease leading to cardiovascular pathology is reported. The SARS-Cov2 virus, responsible for COVID-19, achieves cell entry through an S (spike) high-affinity protein binding to the catalytic domain of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a negative regulator of the RAS pathway. Therefore, it is crucial to examine the relationship between small resistance artery disease, ACE2, and PAH, to understand COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The scope of the present review is to briefly summarize available knowledge on the role of small resistance artery disease and ACE2 in PAH, and critically discuss their clinical relevance in the context of cardiovascular pathology associated to COVID-19.","Galán, María; Jiménez-Altayó, Francesc",Front Cardiovasc Med,24,28

Using systematic review on published data, the present study endeavors to compare the leachate contamination potential of four major landfills of Bangladesh, named Amin Bazar, Matuail, Mogla Bazar and Rowfabad; which are situated in 3 of the 6 big mega cities of Bangladesh and assessed the effects of leachate leakage on surrounding water body as well as on human health. This study, for the first time calculated the leachate pollution index (LPI) for the landfill sites of Bangladesh and found that the LPI of Matuail landfill site (19.81) is much higher which is comparable to some polluted landfill sites of India and Malaysia. The concentrations of several potentially toxic metals found in the surface and ground water in the vicinity of the landfill sites were above the maximum permissible limit values of department of Environment, Bangladesh and World Health Organization (WHO).

METHODS Our institution has offered an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to all employees since January 2021. We collected data on vaccination rates among hospital employees and looked for differences in demographic groups to determine in which groups vaccine hesitancy is the highest. Those who received at least one dose of vaccine were considered ""vaccinated"" for this study. RESULTS There was a 71% vaccination rate among all hospital employees as of March 10, 2021. Age over 50 (odds ratio 1.85, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.24, p<0.01), working in a clinical department (odds ratio 1.19, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.42, p = 0.02), and white race compared to black/African American race (odds ratio 4.55, 95% CI 3.74 to 5.52, p<0.01) were all significant factors for receiving vaccination. Gender (odds ratio 1.12, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.35, p=0.10) was not significant. CONCLUSIONS In a population with equal access to the COVID-19 vaccine, there were significant differences in vaccination rates among different demographic groups. Employees under 50 years of age, non-clinical employees, and black/African American employees were less likely to be vaccinated. This suggests that attitudes towards vaccination, and not simply access to the vaccine, are factors in vaccination rates.","Fossen, Mary C.; Bethany, Margaret D.; Modak, Sanjay R.; Parris, Sally M.; Modak, Rohit M.",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,24,16

We assessed individual characteristics related to changes in emotional exhaustion and psychological distress over time. METHODS: A survey of diverse hospital staff measured emotional exhaustion (Maslach Burnout Inventory) and psychological distress (K6) in Fall 2020 (T(1)) and Winter 2021 (T(2)). Relationships between occupational, personal, and psychological variables were assessed using repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Of 539 T(1) participants, 484 (89.9%) completed T(2). Emotional exhaustion differed by occupational role (F = 7.3, p < .001; greatest in nurses), with increases over time in those with children (F = 8.5, p = .004) or elders (F = 4.0, p = .047). Psychological distress was inversely related to pandemic self-efficacy (F = 110.0, p < .001), with increases over time in those with children (F = 7.0, p = .008). Severe emotional exhaustion occurred in 41.1% (95%CI 36.6–45.4) at T(1) and 49.8% (95%CI 45.4–54.2) at T(2) (McNemar test p < .001).

Yet, in contrast to most other childhood infections as well as other viral and bacterial diseases, prophylactic vaccines or effective antiviral treatments against viral respiratory infections are either still not available, or provide only limited protection. Given the widespread prevalence, a general lack of natural sterilizing immunity, and/or high morbidity and lethality rates of diseases caused by influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, coronaviruses, and rhinoviruses, this difficult situation is a genuine societal challenge. A thorough understanding of the virus-host interactions during these respiratory infections will most probably be pivotal to ultimately meet these challenges. This review attempts to provide a comparative overview of the knowledge about an important part of the interaction between respiratory viruses and their host: the arms race between host innate immunity and viral innate immune evasion. Many, if not all, viruses, including the respiratory viruses listed above, suppress innate immune responses to gain a window of opportunity for efficient virus replication and setting-up of the infection. The consequences for the host's immune response are that it is often incomplete, delayed or diminished, or displays overly strong induction (after the delay) that may cause tissue damage. The affected innate immune response also impacts subsequent adaptive responses, and therefore viral innate immune evasion often undermines fully protective immunity. In this review, innate immune responses relevant for respiratory viruses with an RNA genome will briefly be summarized, and viral innate immune evasion based on shielding viral RNA species away from cellular innate immune sensors will be discussed from different angles. Subsequently, viral enzymatic activities that suppress innate immune responses will be discussed, including activities causing host shut-off and manipulation of stress granule formation. Furthermore, viral protease-mediated immune evasion and viral manipulation of the ubiquitin system will be addressed. Finally, perspectives for use of the reviewed knowledge for the development of novel antiviral strategies will be sketched.","Kikkert, Marjolein",Journal of Innate Immunity,24,24

Improved lifestyle and quality of children’s health is likely to reduce the burden of adult diseases and enhance longevity because seeds of most adult diseases are sown in childhood. Identification and decoding of human genome is expected to revolutionize the practice of pediatrics. The day is not far off when a patient will walk into doctor’s chamber with an electronic or digital health history on a CD or palmtop and a decoded genomic constitution. There will be reduced burden of genetic diseases because of selective abortions of “defective” fetuses and replacement of “bad” genes with “good” ones by genetic engineering. Availability of totipotent stem cells and developments in transplant technology are likely to revolutionize the management of a variety of hematologic cancers and life-threatening genetic disorders. The possibility of producing flawless designer babies by advances in assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) is likely to be mired by several ethical and legal issues. The availability of newer vaccines by recombinant technology for emerging infective and for non-infective lifestyle diseases is likely to improve survival and quality of life. There is going to be a greater focus on the “patient” having the disease rather than “disease” per se by practicing holistic pediatrics by effective utilization of alternative or complementary strategies for health care. Due to advances in technology, pediatrics may get further dehumanized. A true healer cannot simply rely on technology; there must be a spiritual bond between the patient and the physician by exploiting the concept of psycho-neuro-immunology and body-mind interactions. In the years to come, physicians are likely to play “god” but medicine can’t achieve immortality because anything born must die in accordance with nature’s recycling blueprint. The medical science is likely to improve longevity but our goal should be to improve the quality of life.","Singh, Meharban",Indian J Pediatr,24,1

Because of heterogeneous symptoms and a subset of patients even being asymptomatic at presentation, fast identification of infected patients remains challenging. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is the evaluation of different patient groups with a focus on symptoms and pre-existing illness at admission, as this is important for initial assessment and adequate emergency care. METHODS: COVID-19 positive patients at the University Hospital Heidelberg were retrospectively analyzed for disease history and symptoms at the initial presentation as well as mortality. The authors obtained institutional review board (IRB) approval by the Ethics Committee (Medical Faculty of Heidelberg University) prior to commencing the study. RESULTS: Dyspnea was more common in patients admitted to intermediate care/intensive care units (48 vs 13%, P<0.001) and showed a significantly higher percentage in the deceased (91 vs 48%, P=0.004). The symptoms of all presenting patients were highly variable, and many manifestations commonly associated with COVID-19 like cough, fever, and sore throat were only detected in a subset of patients, 60%, 43%, and 33%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Dyspnea was present significantly more often in patients dying of COVID-19 compared to all patients admitted to the IMC/ICU, necessitating adequate observation and monitoring. In all presenting patients, initial symptoms showed large variation; therefore, COVID should be considered as a main differential diagnosis at every patient presentation, and patients with high pre-test probability should, if possible, be isolated until testing results are known.","Korell, Felix; Giannitsis, Evangelos; Merle, Uta; Kihm, Lars Philipp",Open Access Emerg Med,24,5

The RT-LAMP reaction could be finished in 60 min under isothermal condition at 65 °C by employing a set of four primers targeting the 5′ untranslated region of CSFV. The RT-LAMP assay of CSFV showed higher sensitivities than that of RT-PCR, with a detection limit of 5 copies per reaction. No cross-reactivity was observed from the samples of other related viruses including porcine circovirus type 2, porcine parvovirus, porcine pseudorabies virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. The detection rates of CSFV RT-LAMP, RT-PCR and virus isolation for samples including blood, tonsil, nasal and rectal swabs from uninoculated pigs without any clear clinical symptom were 89%, 78% and 71%, respectively. Furthermore, all of the assays showed higher sensitivity for blood and tonsil swabs samples than nasal and rectal swabs.

The lymphoid chemokine, CXCL13, is critical for B cell recruitment and functional organization of peripheral lymphoid tissues, and CXCL13 levels are often elevated in the inflamed CNS. To more directly investigate the role of CXCL13 in CNS B cell migration, its role in animal models of infectious and inflammatory demyelinating disease was examined. During acute alphavirus encephalitis where viral clearance depends on the local actions of anti-viral antibodies, CXCL13 levels and B cell numbers increased in brain tissue over time. Surprisingly, however, CXCL13-deficient animals showed normal CNS B cell recruitment, unaltered CNS virus replication and clearance, and intact peripheral anti-viral antibody responses. During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), CNS levels of CXCL13 increased as symptoms emerged and equivalent numbers of B cells were identified among the CNS infiltrates of CXCL13-deficient mice compared to control animals. However, CXCL13-deficient mice did not sustain pathogenic anti-myelin T cell responses, consistent with their known propensity to develop more self-limited EAE. These data show that CXCL13 is dispensable for CNS B cell recruitment in both models. The disease course is unaffected by CXCL13 in a CNS infection paradigm that depends on a pathogen-specific B cell response, while it is heightened and prolonged by CXCL13 when myelin-specific CD4+ T cells drive CNS pathology. Thus, CXCL13 could be a therapeutic target in certain neuroinflammatory diseases, but not by blocking B cell recruitment to the CNS.","Rainey-Barger, Emily K; Rumble, Julie M; Lalor, Stephen J.; Esen, Nilufer; Segal, Benjamin M; Irani, David N","Brain, Behavior, and Immunity",24,1

Here we report the design and performance of a reinforcement learning system, nicknamed 'Eva'. In the summer of 2020, Eva was deployed across all Greek borders to limit the influx of asymptomatic travellers infected with SARS-CoV-2, and to inform border policies through real-time estimates of COVID-19 prevalence. In contrast to country-wide protocols, Eva allocated Greece's limited testing resources based upon incoming travellers' demographic information and testing results from previous travellers. By comparing Eva's performance against modelled counterfactual scenarios, we show that Eva identified 1.85 times as many asymptomatic, infected travellers as random surveillance testing, with up to 2-4 times as many during peak travel, and 1.25-1.45 times as many asymptomatic, infected travellers as testing policies that only utilize epidemiological metrics. We demonstrate that this latter benefit arises, at least partially, because population-level epidemiological metrics had limited predictive value for the actual prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic travellers and exhibited strong country-specific idiosyncrasies in the summer of 2020. Our results raise serious concerns on the effectiveness of country-agnostic internationally proposed border control policies3 that are based on population-level epidemiological metrics. Instead, our work represents a successful example of the potential of reinforcement learning and real-time data for safeguarding public health.","Bastani, Hamsa; Drakopoulos, Kimon; Gupta, Vishal; Vlachogiannis, Jon; Hadjicristodoulou, Christos; Lagiou, Pagona; Magiorkinis, Gkikas; Paraskevis, Dimitrios; Tsiodras, Sotirios",Nature (Lond.),24,33

Prolonged exposure to backlit screens before sleep influences the circadian system leading to negative consequences on sleep health. We investigated the relationship between changes in evening screen exposure and the time course of sleep disturbances during the home confinement period due to COVID-19. METHODS: 2,123 Italians (mean age ± standard deviation, 33.1 ± 11.6) were tested longitudinally during the third and the seventh week of lockdown. The web-based survey evaluated sleep quality and insomnia symptoms through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Insomnia Severity Index. The second assessment survey inquired about intervening changes in backlit screen exposure in the two hours before falling asleep. RESULTS: Participants who increased electronic device usage showed decreased sleep quality, exacerbated insomnia symptoms, reduced sleep duration, prolonged sleep onset latency, and delayed bedtime and rising time. In this subgroup, the prevalence of poor sleepers and individuals reporting moderate/severe insomnia symptoms increased. Conversely, respondents reporting decreased screen exposure exhibited improved sleep quality and insomnia symptoms. In this subgroup, the prevalence of poor sleepers and moderate/severe insomniacs decreased. Respondents preserving screen time habits did not show variations of the sleep parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation demonstrated a strong relationship between modifications of evening electronic device usage and time course of sleep disturbances during the lockdown period.

The HK-13 and HK-95 isolates showed distinct pathogenicity in hamsters, with higher virus titers and more severe pathological changes in the lungs observed compared to other isolates. HK-95 contains a D614G substitution in the spike protein and demonstrated higher viral gene expression and transmission efficiency in hamsters.

The corresponding mortality rate among different countries and times varies. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the relationship between the mortality rate and prevalence of COVID-19 within a country. METHODS: We collected data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. These data included the daily cumulative death count, recovered count, and confirmed count for each country. This study focused on a total of 36 countries with over 10,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Mortality was the main outcome and dependent variable, and it was computed by dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths by the number of confirmed cases. RESULTS: The results of our global panel regression analysis showed that there was a highly significant correlation between prevalence and mortality (ρ=0.8304; P<.001). We found that every increment of 1 confirmed COVID-19 case per 1000 individuals led to a 1.29268% increase in mortality, after controlling for country-specific baseline mortality and time-fixed effects. Over 70% of excess mortality could be attributed to prevalence, and the heterogeneity among countries’ mortality-prevalence ratio was significant (P<.001). Further, our results showed that China had an abnormally high and significant mortality-prevalence ratio compared to other countries (P<.001). This unusual deviation in the mortality-prevalence ratio disappeared with the removal of the data that was collected from China after February 17, 2020. It is worth noting that the prevalence of a disease relies on accurate diagnoses and comprehensive surveillance, which can be difficult to achieve due to practical or political concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The association between COVID-19 mortality and prevalence was observed and quantified as the mortality-prevalence ratio. Our results highlight the importance of constraining disease transmission to decrease mortality rates. The comparison of mortality-prevalence ratios between countries can be a powerful method for detecting, or even quantifying, the proportion of individuals with undocumented SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lin, Sheng-Hsuan; Fu, Shih-Chen; Kao, Chu-Lan Michael",JMIR Public Health Surveill,24,16

On the other hand, influenza B was the predominant virus in the second peak period of influenza activity during the second half of March 2012. The objectives of this study were to compare the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza A or influenza B. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed data from 2,129 adult patients with influenza-like illnesses who visited the emergency rooms of seven university hospitals in Korea from October 2011 to May 2012. Of 850 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza, 656 (77.2%) had influenza A (H3N2), and 194 (22.8%) influenza B. Age, and the frequencies of cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, hypertension were significantly higher in patients with influenza A (H3N2) (P<0.05). The frequencies of leukopenia or thrombocytopenia in patients with influenza B at initial presentation were statistically higher than those in patients with influenza A (H3N2) (P<0.05). The rate of hospitalization, and length of hospital stay were statistically higher in patients with influenza A (H3N2) (P<0.05), and of the 79 hospitalized patients, the frequency of diabetes, hypertension, cases having at least one of the comorbid conditions, and the proportion of elderly were significantly higher in patients with influenza A (H3N2) (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of males to females and elderly population were significantly higher for influenza A (H3N2) patients group compared with influenza B group. Hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung diseases, cardiovascular disorders, and neuromuscular diseases were independently associated with hospitalization due to influenza. Physicians should assess and treat the underlying comorbid conditions as well as influenza viral infections for the appropriate management of patients with influenza.","Wie, Seong-Heon; So, Byung Hak; Song, Joon Young; Cheong, Hee Jin; Seo, Yu Bin; Choi, Sung Hyuk; Noh, Ji Yun; Baek, Ji Hyeon; Lee, Jin Soo; Kim, Hyo Youl; Kim, Young Keun; Choi, Won Suk; Lee, Jacob; Jeong, Hye Won; Kim, Woo Joo",PLoS One,24,1

METHODS: In a 20-year retrospective study, all skiers and snowboarders with this injury treated surgically at the Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery at the Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria, were included, covering a period from 1999/2000 to 2018/2019. RESULTS: In total, 34 patients were included in this study (30 males (88.2%) and 4 (11.8%) females). Of these 34 injured skiers or snowboarders, 33 (97.1%) were recreational athletes and Non-Austrian citizens, and 21 (61.8%) patients sustained accidental injuries without collision. All of the injuries under investigation, i.e., open lacerations, most often with complete transection, were the patients’ main injuries. Surgery was performed with direct coaptation in 24 patients (70.6%), and with a suralis nerve graft in the other 10 patients (29.4%). CONCLUSION: Traumatic laceration of the peroneal nerve at the knee level by sharp ski or snowboard edges is a rare but severe injury. Causes for this injury may be multifactorial. Recommendations to reduce the risk of such an injury may follow general instructions and warnings to skiers and snowboarders regarding equipment, familiarity with the region, as well as appropriate skills and training.","Metzler, J.; Morandi, E.M.; Schwaiger, K.; Wolfram, D.; Cakl, T.; Djedovic, G.; Bauer, T.; Pierer, G.; Wechselberger, G.; Tasch, C.",Ann Med Surg (Lond),24,6

SEIR compartmental model applied to SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Romania,16.901196,7.3316,2021-06-11,"Global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created an unprecedented infectious disease crisis worldwide. Despite uncertainties about COVID-19, model-based forecasting of competing mitigation measures on its course is urgently needed to inform mitigation policy. We used a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model of the COVID-19 epidemic in New York City and evaluated the potential impact of quarantine duration (from 4 to 16 weeks), quarantine lifting type (1-step lifting for all individuals versus a 2-step lifting according to age), post-quarantine screening, and use of a hypothetical effective treatment against COVID-19 on the disease's cumulative incidence and mortality, and on ICU-bed occupancy. The source code of the model has been deposited in a public source code repository. The model calibrated well and variation of model parameter values had little impact on outcome estimates. While quarantine is efficient to contain the viral spread, it is unlikely to prevent a rebound of the epidemic once lifted. We projected that lifting quarantine in a single step for the full population would be unlikely to substantially lower the cumulative mortality, regardless of quarantine duration. By contrast, a two-step quarantine lifting according to age was associated with a substantially lower cumulative mortality and incidence, up to 71% and 23%, respectively, as well as lower ICU-bed occupancy. Although post-quarantine screening was associated with diminished epidemic rebound, this strategy may not prevent ICUs from being overcrowded. It may even become deleterious after a 2-step quarantine lifting according to age if the herd immunity effect does not had sufficient time to become established in the younger population when the quarantine is lifted for the older population. An effective treatment against COVID-19 would considerably reduce the consequences of the epidemic, even more so if ICU capacity is not exceeded.","Hoertel, N.; Blachier, M.; Blanco, C.; Olfson, M.; Massetti, M.; Limosin, F.; Leleu, H.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,24,20

The primary aim of this review is to establish the incidence and timing of positive faecal samples for the SARS-CoV-2 virus in patients with COVID-19. Methods A systematic literature review was performed to identify studies describing COVID-19 patients tested for the virus in their stool. Data were extracted concerning the nature of the test, number and timing of positive samples, incidence of positive faecal tests after negative nasopharyngeal swabs and any evidence of viable faecal virus or faeco-oral transmission of the virus. Results There were 26 relevant articles identified. Combining these results demonstrated that 53.9% of those tested for faecal RNA in these studies were positive. Duration of faecal viral shedding ranged from 1 to 33 days after nasopharyngeal swab turned negative with one result remaining positive after 47 days of onset of symptoms. There was insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the proportion of cases potentially transmitted through infection via faecally shed virus. Conclusions There is a relatively high rate of positive tests and persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in faecal samples of selected patients with COVID-19. Further research is needed to demonstrate how much these positive tests correlate with viable virus and transmission through the faeco-oral route. This may have important implications for duration of isolation, precautions recommended in individuals undertaking a period of isolation, protective equipment for health professionals and interventional procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract.","Gupta, Sunnia; Parker, Jody; Smits, Stephanie; Underwood, Jonathan; Dolwani, Sunil",,24,1

From this, B. caballi antigens were extracted with the detergent 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate (CHAPS) and used as ELISA antigens. A control antigen of normal erythrocytes from the same donor horse was prepared in an identical manner. The ELISA and Western blot were validated by testing of sera from horses experimentally infected with B. caballi or B. equi or not infected with Babesia spp. ELISA and Western blot results were compared with those obtained by the immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and complement fixation test (CFT). The sensitivity of the ELISA of 98.3% obtained for sera from day 14 after infection was superior to the Western blot (94.9%), the IFAT (96.6%) and the CFT (28.8%). No positive results were obtained in the ELISA and Western blot with 106 sera from horses not infected with Babesia spp. resulting in a calculated specificity of 100% for both tests. Cross reactions of B. equi-positive sera did occur to a larger extent in the ELISA (20%) than in the IFAT (4%). No cross reactions were observed with the Western blot and the CFT. The higher sensitivity of the ELISA was also demonstrated by testing of 132 field sera: more positive results were obtained by ELISA (112) as compared to IFAT (92) or CFT (41). The validity of these results was confirmed by testing of sera by Western blot. The ELISA as the most sensitive test provides the best method for the identification of carrier horses to prevent the introduction into non-endemic areas (export testing). Positive ELISA results can be confirmed by Western blot, if a species-specific diagnosis is required.","Böse, Reinhard; Peymann, Berit",International Journal for Parasitology,24,17

Certain CLRs play an important role in viral infections as they efficiently interact with viruses. However, it has become clear that deadly viruses subvert the function of CLRs to escape antiviral immunity and promote infection. In particular, viruses target CLRs to suppress or modulate type I interferons that play a central role in the innate and adaptive defense against viruses. In this review, we discuss the function of CLRs in binding to enveloped viruses like HIV-1 and Dengue virus, and how uptake and signaling cascades have decisive effects on the outcome of infection.","Bermejo-Jambrina, Marta; Eder, Julia; Helgers, Leanne C.; Hertoghs, Nina; Nijmeijer, Bernadien M.; Stunnenberg, Melissa; Geijtenbeek, Teunis B.

Their structural and functional diversity is thought to be reasonably well-understood, especially in retroelements, which transpose via an RNA intermediate copied into cDNA by the element-encoded reverse transcriptase, and are characterized by a compact structure. Here, we report a novel type of expandable eukaryotic retroelements, which we call Terminons. These elements can attach to G-rich telomeric repeat overhangs at the chromosome ends, in a process apparently facilitated by complementary C-rich repeats at the 3′-end of the RNA template immediately adjacent to a hammerhead ribozyme motif. Terminon units, which can exceed 40 kb in length, display an unusually complex and diverse structure, and can form very long chains, with host genes often captured between units. As the principal polymerizing component, Terminons contain Athena reverse transcriptases previously described in bdelloid rotifers and belonging to the enigmatic group of Penelope-like elements, but can additionally accumulate multiple cooriented ORFs, including DEDDy 3′-exonucleases, GDSL esterases/lipases, GIY-YIG-like endonucleases, rolling-circle replication initiator (Rep) proteins, and putatively structural ORFs with coiled-coil motifs and transmembrane domains. The extraordinary length and complexity of Terminons and the high degree of interfamily variability in their ORF content challenge the current views on the structural organization of eukaryotic retroelements, and highlight their possible connections with the viral world and the implications for the elevated frequency of gene transfer.","Arkhipova, Irina R.; Yushenova, Irina A.; Rodriguez, Fernando",Molecular Biology and Evolution,24,20

Recurrent hospital visits and hospital admission are potential risk factors for acquiring infection with its causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus−2 (SARS-CoV-2). As immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) constitute the therapeutic backbone for the vast majority of patients with advanced lung cancer in the absence of actionable driver oncogenes, there have been intense discussions within the oncology community regarding risk-benefit of delaying these treatments or use of alternative extended-interval treatment strategies to minimize the risk of viral transmission secondary to unintended nosocomial exposures. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for extended-interval strategy of pembrolizumab at a dose of 400 mg every 6 weeks for all already approved oncologic indications. Herein, we summarize the evidence from the in silico pharmacokinetic modeling/simulation studies supporting extended-interval dosing strategies for the ICIs used in lung cancer.

We sought to further clarify the possible association between ACEI/ARB use and the risk of poor clinical outcomes of COVID-19. METHODS: From the completely enumerated COVID-19 cohort in Korea, we identified 1,290 patients with hypertension, of whom 682 had and 603 did not have records of ACEI/ARB use during the 30-day period before their COVID-19 diagnosis. Our primary endpoint comprised clinical outcomes, including all-cause mortality, use of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, and sepsis. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to mitigate selection bias, and a Poisson regression model to estimate the relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for comparing outcomes between ACEI/ARB users and non-users. RESULTS: Compared to non-use, ACEI/ARB use was associated with lower clinical outcomes (IPTW-adjusted RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.85; p=0.005). For individual outcomes, ACEI/ARB use was not associated with all-cause mortality (IPTW-adjusted RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.35 to 1.09; p=0.097) or respiratory events (IPTW-adjusted RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.17; p=0.904).

To maintain consistent landscape quality, track environmental interventions, or measure the impacts of planned and unexpected events there is a need for co-ordinated national as well as local environmental monitoring. Conventionally indicators are used as monitoring proxies for tracking complex changes in landscape form and qualities, designation criteria, compliance against protective legislation, and the effectiveness of varying governance programmes. The regulatory agency of UK (English) environmental standards on behalf of the government, Natural England, monitors against a framework of indicators for the designation criteria of ‘natural beauty’ in 10 UK National Parks (NP) and 33 Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), and distributes data and analysis annually. This paper centres on an empirical case study that investigates environmental indicators used on-the-ground, as evidenced in AONB management plans. These bottom-up indicators are compared with top-down indicator frameworks from both Natural England’s monitoring programme (FMEOPL), and the emerging indicators associated with the UK 25-Year Plan to Improve the Environment (25YEP). A methodology is developed to collate diverse indicators from these three policy and governance sources and to recommend a synthetic list of 158 indicators with future potential as candidates of a national framework for monitoring environmental change in the UK at landscape-scale.

SARS-CoV-2 variants have the potential to evade natural and vaccine-induced immunity. Methods In a longitudinal cohort study of healthcare workers (HCWs) in Oxfordshire, UK, we investigated the protection from symptomatic and asymptomatic PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection conferred by vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2, Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCOV-19) and prior infection (determined using anti-spike antibody status), using Poisson regression adjusted for age, sex, temporal changes in incidence and role. We estimated protection conferred after one versus two vaccinations and from infections with the B.1.1.7 variant identified using whole genome sequencing. Results 13,109 HCWs participated; 8285 received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (1407 two doses) and 2738 the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (49 two doses). Compared to unvaccinated seronegative HCWs, natural immunity and two vaccination doses provided similar protection against symptomatic infection: no HCW vaccinated twice had symptomatic infection, and incidence was 98% lower in seropositive HCWs (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.02 [95%CI <0.01-0.18]). Two vaccine doses or seropositivity reduced the incidence of any PCR-positive result with or without symptoms by 90% (0.10 [0.02-0.38]) and 85% (0.15 [0.08-0.26]) respectively. Single-dose vaccination reduced the incidence of symptomatic infection by 67% (0.33 [0.21-0.52]) and any PCR-positive result by 64% (0.36 [0.26-0.50]). There was no evidence of differences in immunity induced by natural infection and vaccination for infections with S-gene target failure and B.1.1.7. Conclusion Natural infection resulting in detectable anti-spike antibodies and two vaccine doses both provide robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, including against the B.1.1.7 variant.","Lumley, S.

Thrombotic complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease and/or traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and advanced age, are at the highest risk of death from COVID-19. In this Review, we summarize new lines of evidence that point to both platelet and endothelial dysfunction as essential components of COVID-19 pathology and describe the mechanisms that might account for the contribution of cardiovascular risk factors to the most severe outcomes in COVID-19. We highlight the distinct contributions of coagulopathy, thrombocytopathy and endotheliopathy to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and discuss potential therapeutic strategies in the management of patients with COVD-19. Harnessing the expertise of the biomedical and clinical communities is imperative to expand the available therapeutics beyond anticoagulants and to target both thrombocytopathy and endotheliopathy. Only with such collaborative efforts can we better prepare for further waves and for future coronavirus-related pandemics.","Gu, Sean X.; Tyagi, Tarun; Jain, Kanika; Gu, Vivian W.; Lee, Seung Hee; Hwa, Jonathan M.; Kwan, Jennifer M.; Krause, Diane S.; Lee, Alfred I.; Halene, Stephanie; Martin, Kathleen A.; Chun, Hyung J.; Hwa, John",Nat Rev Cardiol,24,33

Serious and life threatening COVID-19 are defined as per published literature (please, refer to the full protocol, Additional file 1). The rationale is that TPE can remove interleukins-3, 6, 8, 10, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Thus, it may reduce the cytokine release syndrome associated with fulminant COVID-19 disease. TRIAL DESIGN: Pilot, interventional, open-label, randomized controlled multicenter trial. PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion criteria are: 1) age ≥ 18 years old; 2) intubation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission; 3) serious and/or life-threatening COVID-19 (please, refer to the full protocol, Additional file 1). SARS-CoV-2 infection is confirmed by Real-Time-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (RT-PCR) assays using QuantiNova Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) in a Light-Cycler 480 real-time PCR system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Exclusion criteria are: 1) previous allergic reaction to plasma exchange or its ingredients (i.e., sodium citrate), 2) two consecutive negative RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 at least 24 hours apart, 3) mild COVID-19 not requiring ICU admission and 4) terminally ill patients receiving palliative care. The primary site will be King Saud Medical City (KSMC), Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Also, the study will run in ICUs (Ministry of Health Cluster 1; Riyadh) and other centers in KSA pending their institutional review board (IRB) approval. INTERVENTIONS AND COMPARATOR: The intervention group will receive TPE, plus empiric treatment for COVID-19. TPE is administered using the Spectra Optia TM Apheresis System equipped with the Depuro D2000 Adsorption Cartridge (Terumo BCT Inc., USA). The first dose is 1.5 plasma volumes, followed by one plasma volume on alternate days or daily for five to seven total treatments. Spectra Optia TM Apheresis System operates with acid-citrate dextrose anticoagulant (ACDA) as per Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2019 guidelines. Plasma is replaced with albumin 5% or fresh frozen plasma in patients with coagulopathy (prothrombin time >37 seconds; international normalized ratio >3; activated partial thromboplastin time >100 or fibrinogen level <100 mg/d). TPE sessions are performed daily over four hours and laboratory markers measured daily. The comparators are controls not receiving TPE but usual empiric treatment for COVID-19 as per institutional, national and international recommendations. Both groups will receive standard ICU supportive care. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary study end-point is 28-day mortality and safety of TPE in serious and/or life-threatening COVID-19. Safety will be evaluated by the documentation of any pertinent adverse and/or serious adverse effects related to TPE as per institutional, national and international (Food and Drug Administration) guidelines. Secondary outcomes are: i) improvement in Sequential Organ Function Assessment (SOFA) score ; ii) changes in inflammatory markers: serum C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, d-dimers and interleukin-6; iii) days on mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay. RANDOMIZATION: Eligible consented patients are randomized (1:1 allocation) after stratification by ICU center and two PaO2/FIO2 ratio categories (> 150 and ≤ 150). Randomization occurs in variable block sizes of four to eight patients. A web-based randomization service, randomize.net, is used to allocate patients to their respective strata prior to the intervention or control therapy. BLINDING (MASKING): Given the visibility of TPE machinery, the intervention will be unblinded; hence, no enrollment concealment will be expedited. The lack of allocation concealment will be mitigated by several measures (please, refer to the full protocol, Additional file 1). NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): This pilot randomized trial aims to recruit a convenience sample of patients with serious and/or life-threatening COVID-19. Therefore, at least 20 patients are to be randomized to each group per participating center. We are hoping to consent and randomize approximately 60 patients in each group over a 3 to 6 months period giving a total of 120 participants. TRIAL STATUS: The protocol version 1 was approved 29/04/2020. Recruitment is ongoing, and began on 01/05/2020. We estimate completion by 29/10/2020. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered at ISRCTN on 18/05/2020 (ISRCTN21363594; doi.10.1186/ ISRCTN21363594).

This study aimed to assess the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of varying FIT positivity thresholds on colorectal cancer (CRC) detection in primary health care. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 38,675 asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with a FIT (OC‐Sensor™) performed between 2012 and 2016 in a primary health‐care setting, using a clinical laboratory database of two Spanish areas linked with the National Health System's Hospital Discharge Records Database. The primary outcome was 2‐year CRC incidence. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 63.2 years; 17,792 (46.0%) were male. CRC prevalence was 1.7% (650/38,675). The percentage of patients with a FIT result above the threshold was 20.7% and 14.6% for 10 μg Hb/g faeces and 20 μg Hb/g faeces thresholds, respectively. Sensitivity was 90.5% (95% confidence interval 88.0%–92.5%) at a 10 μg Hb/g faeces threshold, and this decreased by 3.1% when a 20 μg Hb/g faeces threshold was used. The negative predictive value for CRC was at least 99.2% in any subgroup analysed. At a 20 μg Hb/g faeces threshold, less than one additional CRC would be missed per 1000 patients investigated, while approximately 1.3 times more colonoscopy examinations were needed to identify an incidence of CRC using the lowest threshold for any situation analysed. CONCLUSIONS: In primary health care, a quantitative FIT threshold should be tailored to colonoscopy capacity and CRC prevalence in specific populations.","Pin‐Vieito, Noel; García Nimo, Laura; Bujanda, Luis; Román Alonso, Begona; Gutierrez‐Stampa, María Ángeles; Aguilar‐Gama, Vanessa; Portillo, Isabel; Cubiella, Joaquín",United European Gastroenterol J,24,28

For that matter, we used a Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) search on PubMed. Inclusion criteria included papers written in the English language and human subjects. Intravenous (IV) ribavirin is the most effective treatment for an acute infection. Post-exposure prophylaxis with oral ribavirin is recommended. There is not sufficient evidence to recommended convalescent plasma for the treatment of Lassa fever. LF continues to be left in the shade from global and scientific attention despite experts expecting a rise in current and future infections due to the Lassa fever virus (LFV).","Alli, Ammar; Ortiz, Juan Fernando; Fabara, Stephanie P; Patel, Amrapali; Halan, Taras",Cureus,24,28

The development of a universal human coronavirus vaccine could prevent future pandemics. We characterized 198 antibodies isolated from four COVID19+ subjects and identified 14 SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. One targeted the NTD, one recognized an epitope in S2 and twelve bound the RBD. Three anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies cross-neutralized SARS-CoV-1 by effectively blocking binding of both the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to the ACE2 receptor. Using the K18-hACE transgenic mouse model, we demonstrate that the neutralization potency rather than the antibody epitope specificity regulates the in vivo protective potential of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The anti-S2 antibody also neutralized SARS-CoV-1 and all four cross-neutralizing antibodies neutralized the B.1.351 mutant strain. Thus, our study reveals that epitopes in S2 can serve as blueprints for the design of immunogens capable of eliciting cross-neutralizing coronavirus antibodies.","Jennewein, Madeleine F.; MacCamy, Anna J.; Akins, Nicholas R.; Feng, Junli; Homad, Leah J.; Hurlburt, Nicholas K.; Seydoux, Emily; Wan, Yu-Hsin; Stuart, Andrew B.; Edara, Venkata Viswanadh; Floyd, Katharine; Vanderheiden, Abigail; Mascola, John R.; Doria-Rose, Nicole; Wang, Lingshu; Yang, Eun Sung; Chu, Helen Y.; Torres, Jonathan L.; Ozorowski, Gabriel; Ward, Andrew B.; Whaley, Rachael E.; Cohen, Kristen W.; Pancera, Marie; McElrath, M.

The pandemic has significantly increased the amount of time many children spend on YouTube—watching videos for both entertainment and education. However, it is unclear how children conceptualize the people they see on YouTube. Prior to the pandemic, children 3–8 years old (N = 117) were recruited to participate. Children were told that they would see pictures taken from videos and answer questions about them. Children saw three physical photos with the same image of a man and a bird and were told that the photo was (a) from a video on the experimenter’s phone, (b) from a video on television, or (c) from a video on YouTube. They were asked whether the person in the photo was real or not real, which video would be best for learning, and which video they would prefer to watch. Findings indicated that children were marginally less likely to believe that people on YouTube are real than people in a video on a phone, with no difference between beliefs about people on YouTube and television. Notably, these beliefs were similar across the age range tested here. Across all ages, children preferred to watch YouTube more than phone videos and believed that YouTube possessed greater educational value than both phone and television videos.","Hassinger-Das, Brenna; Dore, Rebecca A.; Aloisi, Katherine; Hossain, Maruf; Pearce, Madeleine; Paterra, Mark",Front Psychol,24,23

The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended vigorous testing to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 from other respiratory infections to aid in guiding appropriate care and management. Situations like this have demanded robust testing strategies and pooled testing of samples for SARS- COV- 2 virus has provided the solution to mass screening of people. The pooled testing strategy can be very effective in testing with limited resources, yet it comes with its own limitations. These limitations need critical consideration when it comes to testing of highly infectious disease like COVID -19. Methods The study evaluated the pooled testing of nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS- COV- 2 by comparing sensitivity of individual sample testing with 4 and 8 pool sample testing. Median cycle threshold (Ct) values were compared. The precision of pooled testing was assessed by doing an inter and intra assay of pooled samples. Coefficient of variance was calculated for inter and intra assay variability. Results The sensitivity becomes considerably low when the samples are pooled, there is a higher percentage of false negatives with higher pool size and when the patient viral load is low or weak positive samples. High variability was seen in the intra and inter assay, especially in weak positive samples and larger pool size. Conclusion As COVID - 19 numbers are still high and testing capacity needs to be high, we have to meticulously evaluate the testing strategy for each country depending on its testing capacity, infrastructure, economic strength, and need to make a serious call on cost effective strategy of resource saving and risk/ cost of missing positive patients.","Mahmoud, D.

Accordingly, our objective was to test the association between scores from an array of cognitive function tests and self-reported vaccine hesitancy after the announcement of the successful testing of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine. METHODS: We used individual-level data from a pandemic-focused study (COVID Survey), a prospective cohort study nested within United Kingdom Understanding Society (Main Survey). In the week immediately following the announcement of successful testing of the first efficacious inoculation (November/December 2020), data on vaccine intentionality were collected in 11740 individuals (6702 women) aged 16-95. Pre-pandemic scores on general cognitive function, ascertained from a battery of six tests, were captured in 2011/12 wave of the Main Survey. Study members self-reported their intention to take up a vaccination for COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the study sample, 17.2% (N=1842) indicated they were hesitant about having the vaccine. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, study members with a lower baseline cognition score were markedly more likely to be vaccine hesitant (odds ratio per standard deviation lower score in cognition; 95% confidence interval: 1.76; 1.62, 1.90). Adjustment for mental and physical health plus household shielding status had no impact on these results, whereas controlling for educational attainment led to partial attenuation but the probability of hesitancy was still elevated (1.52; 1.37, 1.67). There was a linear association for vaccine hesitancy across the full range of cognition scores (p for trend: p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Erroneous social media reports might have complicated personal decision-making, leading to people with lower cognitive ability test scores being vaccine-hesitant. With people with lower cognition also experiencing higher rates of COVID-19 in studies conducted prior to vaccine distribution, these new findings are suggestive of a potential additional disease burden.","David Batty, G.; Deary, Ian J.; Fawns-Ritchie, Chloe; Gale, Catharine R.; Altschul, Drew",Brain Behav Immun,24,31

Substantial inter-individual variability in individual disease courses is hypothesized to be partially mediated by the differential regulation of the genes that interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus or are involved in the subsequent host response. Here, we comprehensively investigated non-genetic and genetic factors influencing COVID-19-relevant bronchial epithelial gene expression. METHODS: We analyzed RNA-sequencing data from bronchial epithelial brushings obtained from uninfected individuals. We related ACE2 gene expression to host and environmental factors in the SPIROMICS cohort of smokers with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and replicated these associations in two asthma cohorts, SARP and MAST. To identify airway biology beyond ACE2 binding that may contribute to increased susceptibility, we used gene set enrichment analyses to determine if gene expression changes indicative of a suppressed airway immune response observed early in SARS-CoV-2 infection are also observed in association with host factors. To identify host genetic variants affecting COVID-19 susceptibility in SPIROMICS, we performed expression quantitative trait (eQTL) mapping and investigated the phenotypic associations of the eQTL variants. RESULTS: We found that ACE2 expression was higher in relation to active smoking, obesity, and hypertension that are known risk factors of COVID-19 severity, while an association with interferon-related inflammation was driven by the truncated, non-binding ACE2 isoform. We discovered that expression patterns of a suppressed airway immune response to early SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to other viruses, are similar to patterns associated with obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, which may thus contribute to a COVID-19-susceptible airway environment. eQTL mapping identified regulatory variants for genes implicated in COVID-19, some of which had pheWAS evidence for their potential role in respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that clinically relevant variation in the expression of COVID-19-related genes is associated with host factors, environmental exposures, and likely host genetic variation.

Early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention can ameliorate symptoms of infection and reduce mortality. The conventional diagnosis of viral infections, including flu viruses, has evolved over the years with diverse approaches, however, there are inherent short comings associated with these testing. There is an urgent need for rapid and low-cost diagnostic assays, due to the enormous annual burden of influenza diseases and its associated mortality. In this study, novel, low cost and easy to use colorimetric flu virus biosensor assay was developed. The sandwich assay format was utilized using antibodies immobilized onto cotton swabs, for the rapid detection of flu A and B viruses. These swabs serve as sample collection, analytes pre-concentration as well as sensing tool. The proof of concept was established for this assay in buffer and mucus samples.

Between December 2019 and January 2020, a variety of severe pneumonia-related disease names suddenly appeared, and more name varieties kept coming up afterwards. To better understand the introduction and spread of these names, 16 different COVID-19-related name varieties were selected covering the period from the end of December 2019, when the epidemic started, to mid-March 2020, a moment at which the term competition had stabilized. By way of big data analysis, the initiation and distribution of the 16 names across the media landscape was traced with regard to the impact of different media platforms, while the distribution frequency of each of the selected terms was mapped, resulting in a distinction of three groups of disease names, each with a different media and time profile. The results were discussed based on the hypotheses of disease confusion by name variety and management failures in absence of clear language governance at the national and global levels. The analysis of the data led to a refutation of both hypotheses. Based on this discussion, the study offers empirically based suggestions for the WHO in their naming practices and further research.","Dong, Hongjie; Zhou, Minli; Che, Dewei; Zhang, Huiying; Bodomo, Adams",Int J Environ Res Public Health,24,30

Few studies have explored the mental health consequences of such environment. The objective of this study is to describe the mental health of migrants at different stages of a regularization program. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included migrants undocumented or in the process of regularization. We screened for symptoms of anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance using validated tools. We created a composite outcome of altered mental health including these components plus self-report of a recent diagnosis of mental health condition by a health professional. RESULTS: We enrolled 456 participants of whom 246 (53.9%) were undocumented. They were predominantly women (71.9%) with a median age of 43.3 (interquartile range: 15.5) years, from Latin America (63.6%) or Asia (20.2%) who had lived in Switzerland for 12 (IQR: 7) years. Overall, 57.2% presented symptoms of altered mental health. Prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance were 36% (95% confidence interval: 31.6–40.6%), 45.4% (95% CI: 40.8–50.1%) and 23% (95% CI: 19.2–27.2), respectively. Younger age (adjusted odd ratio: 0.7; 95% CI: 0.5–0.9 for each additional decade), social isolation (aOR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.4–4.2), exposure to abuse (aOR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.1–3.5), financial instability (aOR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.4–3.7) and multi-morbidity (aOR: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.7–6.5) were associated with increased risk of having altered mental health while being in the early stages of the process of regularization had no effect (aOR: 1.3: 95% CI: 0.8–2.2). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the need for multi-pronged social and health interventions addressing the various domains of undocumented migrants living difficulties as complement to legal status regularization policies. Protection against unfair working conditions and abuse, access to adequate housing, promoting social integration and preventive interventions to tackle the early occurrence of chronic diseases may all contribute to reduce the burden of altered mental health in this group. More research is needed to assess the long-term impact of legal status regularization on mental health.","Fakhoury, Julien; Burton-Jeangros, Claudine; Consoli, Liala; Duvoisin, Aline; Courvoisier, Delphine; Jackson, Yves",BMC Psychiatry,24,26

DESIGN: Our model incorporates age-specific mixing, infectiousness, susceptibility and severity to assess the final size of the epidemic under different public health intervention scenarios in Australia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The model predicts the final infected population, cumulative hospitalizations, deaths and years of life lost following an epidemic wave, taking into account vaccination and additional mitigation measures. RESULTS: Assuming a pre-vaccination effective reproduction number for the Delta variant of 5, we show that the current ""Mixed"" program (vaccinating over 60s with AstraZeneca and under 60s with Pfizer) would not achieve herd immunity, unless 85% of the population is covered (including many 5-16 year-olds). At a lower effective reproduction number of 3, the Mixed program can achieve herd immunity at 60-70% coverage without vaccinating 5-15 year-olds. An effective reproduction number of 7 precludes achieving herd immunity with existing vaccines, however vaccination still prevents over 85% of deaths compared with no vaccination. CONCLUSION: Vaccinating the vulnerable first is the optimal policy at low coverage, but vaccinating high transmitters becomes more important in settings where reproduction numbers are lower and coverage is higher. Vaccinating over 85% of the population including children would likely be needed to achieve herd immunity at the most plausible effective reproduction number of 5. Even without herd immunity, vaccines are highly beneficial at reducing deaths.","McBryde, Emma; Meehan, Michael; Caldwell, Jamie; Adekunle, Adeshina; Ogunlade, Samson; Kuddus, Abdul; Ragonnet, Romain; Jayasundara, Pavithra; Trauer, James M; Cope, Robert C",Med. j.

However, the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections is likely to be higher than the confirmed case counts because many infected people have mild or no symptoms, and limitations exist with regard to testing capacity and surveillance systems in Zambia. We aimed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in six districts of Zambia in July, 2020, using a population-based household survey. METHODS: Between July 4 and July 27, 2020, we did a cross-sectional cluster-sample survey of households in six districts of Zambia. Within each district, 16 standardised enumeration areas were randomly selected as primary sampling units using probability proportional to size. 20 households from each standardised enumeration area were selected using simple random sampling. All members of selected households were eligible to participate. Consenting participants completed a questionnaire and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using real-time PCR (rtPCR) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using ELISA. Prevalence estimates, adjusted for the survey design, were calculated for each diagnostic test separately, and combined. We applied the prevalence estimates to census population projections for each district to derive the estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. FINDINGS: Overall, 4258 people from 1866 households participated in the study. The median age of participants was 18·2 years (IQR 7·7–31·4) and 50·6% of participants were female. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence for the combined measure was 10·6% (95% CI 7·3–13·9). The rtPCR-positive prevalence was 7·6% (4·7–10·6) and ELISA-positive prevalence was 2·1% (1·1–3·1). An estimated 454 708 SARS-CoV-2 infections (95% CI 312 705–596 713) occurred in the six districts between March and July, 2020, compared with 4917 laboratory-confirmed cases reported in official statistics from the Zambia National Public Health Institute. INTERPRETATION: The estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections was much higher than the number of reported cases in six districts in Zambia. The high rtPCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was consistent with observed community transmission during the study period. The low ELISA-positive SARS-CoV-2 prevalence might be associated with mitigation measures instituted after initial cases were reported in March, 2020. Zambia should monitor patterns of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and promote measures that can reduce transmission.","Mulenga, Lloyd B; Hines, Jonas Z; Fwoloshi, Sombo; Chirwa, Lameck; Siwingwa, Mpanji; Yingst, Samuel; Wolkon, Adam; Barradas, Danielle T; Favaloro, Jennifer; Zulu, James E; Banda, Dabwitso; Nikoi, Kotey I; Kampamba, Davies; Banda, Ngawo; Chilopa, Batista; Hanunka, Brave; Stevens, Thomas L; Shibemba, Aaron; Mwale, Consity; Sivile, Suilanji; Zyambo, Khozya D; Makupe, Alex; Kapina, Muzala; Mweemba, Aggrey; Sinyange, Nyambe; Kapata, Nathan; Zulu, Paul M; Chanda, Duncan; Mupeta, Francis; Chilufya, Chitalu; Mukonka, Victor; Agolory, Simon; Malama, Kennedy",Lancet Glob Health,24,23

Here we perform a comprehensive in vitro and ex vivo comparison of viruses from parental and recombinant virus lineages (lineage 3, n = 7; lineage 4, n = 8; lineage 5, n = 9 viruses) from Saudi Arabia, isolated immediately before and after the shift toward lineage 5. Replication of lineage 5 viruses is significantly increased. Transcriptional profiling finds reduced induction of immune genes IFNB1, CCL5, and IFNL1 in lung cells infected with lineage 5 strains. Phenotypic differences may be determined by IFN antagonism based on experiments using IFN receptor knock out and signaling inhibition. Additionally, lineage 5 is more resilient against IFN pre-treatment of Calu-3 cells (ca. 10-fold difference in replication).

Despite this increased interest in visual neural oscillations in AD, little is known regarding their role in AD-related cognitive impairment and in particular during visuospatial processing. METHODS: We used source-imaged magnetoencephalography (MEG) and an established visuospatial processing task to elicit multi-spectral neuronal responses in 35 biomarker-confirmed patients on the AD spectrum and 20 biomarker-negative older adults. Neuronal oscillatory responses were imaged to the level of the cortex, and group classifications and neurocognitive relationships were modeled using logistic and linear regression, respectively. RESULTS: Visuospatial neuronal oscillations in the theta, alpha, and gamma ranges significantly predicted the classification of patients on the AD spectrum. Importantly, the direction of these effects differed by response frequency, such that patients on the AD spectrum exhibited weaker alpha-frequency responses in lateral occipital regions, and stronger gamma-frequency responses in the primary visual cortex, as compared to biomarker-negative older adults. In addition, alpha and gamma, but not theta, oscillations robustly predicted cognitive status (i.e., MoCA and MMSE scores), such that patients with neural responses that deviated more from those of healthy older adults exhibited poorer cognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS: We find that the multi-spectral neural dynamics supporting visuospatial processing differentiate patients on the AD spectrum from cognitively normal, biomarker-negative older adults. Oscillations in the alpha and gamma bands also relate to cognitive status in ways that are informative for emerging clinical interventions.","Wiesman, Alex I.; Murman, Daniel L.; May, Pamela E.; Schantell, Mikki; Wolfson, Sara L.; Johnson, Craig M.; Wilson, Tony W.",Alzheimers Res Ther,24,26

It subsequently spread to other countries in the region. The objective of this study is to analyze the epidemiological profile of COVID-19 in West Africa from the first reported case to 31 January 2021. Method: We publicly used available data from reliable sources and from the COVID-19R package. We used epidemic curves to describe the trends in the daily evolution of confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 in West Africa and specifically in the five countries. The reproduction rate and evolution rates were calculated from these trends. Results: As of 31 January 2021, West Africa had 342,938 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 4,496 deaths. Nigeria had 131,242 cases with 1,586 deaths. Senegal had 26,523 cases with 628 deaths. The case-fatality rate in Mali was 4.08% and the attack rate in Cape Verde was 2587 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In Nigeria, Senegal, Mauritania and Mali, the epidemic curves supported by the evolution rates showed an increase in confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 during December 2020 and January 2021 compared to the last two months. The effective reproduction rates (Re) inferred a slowdown in virus transmission (Re < 1) in these countries except for Senegal. Conclusion: The results showed that COVID-19 was still circulating in some West African countries in late 2020 and early 2021.

Most reported cases are diagnosed with probable/putative COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) based on a combination of non-specific clinical, radiographic, and mycological findings, but the clinical significance - and whether these cases represent true invasive disease - is unresolved. Methods We performed a systematic review of autopsy series of decedents with COVID-19 for evidence of IMD. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, OVID (Embase) and MedRxiv for English- or French-language case series published between January 1, 2019 to September 26, 2020. We included series describing lung histology of [≥]3 decedents, and authors were contacted for missing information as necessary. Results We identified 51 case series describing autopsies of 702 decedents. Individual-level data was available for 430 decedents. The median age was 72 (IQR 61 to 80) years. Diabetes mellitus, pre-existing lung disease, and immunocompromising conditions were reported for 129 (32%), 95 (22%), and 25 (6%) decedents, respectively. The median hospitalization length was 10 (IQR 5-22) days. 51.6% of decedents had received mechanical ventilation for a median of nine (IQR 5-20) days. Treatment included immunomodulation in 60 (most often steroids or tocilizumab) and antifungals in 41 decedents. Eleven decedents (1.6%) had autopsy-confirmed IMD (6 with CAPA, 4 with invasive pulmonary mycosis not specified and 1 with disseminated mucormycosis). Among 173 decedents who received mechanical ventilation, 5 had IMD (2.9%). Conclusions Autopsy-proven IMD, including CAPA, is uncommon in fatal COVID-19.","Kula, B.; Clancy, C. J.; Nguyen, M.

However, there are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to appropriately measure this risk. First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed. Second, the observed dataset of reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed. Third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertainty in the risk of death from COVID-19, and high-risk individuals should be identified using approaches that can address the abovementioned three problems. Although COVID-19 involves mostly mild infections among the majority of the general population, the risk of death among young adults is higher than that of seasonal influenza, and elderly with underlying comorbidities require additional care.","Kobayashi, Tetsuro; Jung, Sung-mok; Linton, Natalie M.; Kinoshita, Ryo; Hayashi, Katsuma; Miyama, Takeshi; Anzai, Asami; Yang, Yichi; Yuan, Baoyin; Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.; Suzuki, Ayako; Nishiura, Hiroshi",J Clin Med,24,18

This limits their applicability for analysing the effects of shocks that operate over a short period or with different intensities through a year. It is relatively easy to convert an annual CGE model to shorter periodicity, for example a quarter, if we ignore seasonal differences in the pattern of economic activity, but this is not acceptable for agriculture. This paper introduces seasonal factors to the agricultural specification in a detailed quarterly CGE model of the United States. The model is then applied to analyse the effects of the COVID pandemic on U.S. farm industries. Taking account of the general features of the pandemic such as the reduction in household spending, we find that these effects are mild relative to the effects on most other industries. However, agriculture is subject to potential supply‐chain disruptions. We apply our quarterly model to analyse two such possibilities: loss of labour at harvest time in Fruit & nut farms, and temporary closure of meat‐processing plants. We find that these disruptions are unlikely to cause noticeable reductions in the supply of food products to U.S. households.","Dixon, Peter B.; Rimmer, Maureen T.",Aust J Agric Resour Econ,24,16

Items measured behaviors currently established as primary strategies to prevent and reduce the spread of the COVID-19 infection. Methods: An item pool of 29 questions was generated with the aim of estimating the frequency of specific behaviors and were written to avoid confounding the description of behavioral actions with evaluative judgements. Responses were collected from 401 young adults using an anonymous online survey. Results: An Exploratory Factor Analysis was conducted with the purpose of item reduction and subscale development. A 14-item Social Distance Scale emerged, consisting of four subscales: Isolation from Community (IC), Work from Home (WH), Family Contact (FC), and Protective Behaviors (PB). The initial psychometric evaluation of the scales indicated adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability. (4) Conclusions: The Social Distance Scale (v1) is a promising new instrument which may be applied at the population or individual level. It may be used in conjunction with COVID-19 testing to measure interactions between social distancing factors and transmission.

Pharmacists worked in close collaboration with doctors and members of the local community. They provided triaging services, timely health advice about chronic health problems, and managed acute issues, including wound and burn management and mental health support in traumatic conditions, sometimes without power and communication amenities. The challenges presented to pharmacists during the bushfires warranted creative and flexible approaches at times. Conclusion: This study highlights the need for mental health support and training for pharmacists, provisional prescribing privileges, and a clearer set of contingency regulations and legislation related to emergencies and natural disasters. Further research is warranted to gain greater insight into the roles undertaken by Australian pharmacists during natural disasters and their autonomy in decision making processes during such times.","Moss, Alexandra; Green, Toni; Moss, Simon; Waghorn, Janique; Bushell, Mary-Jessimine",Pharmacy (Basel),24,30

LNPs are relatively immunologically inert and can be produced in a cost effective and scalable manner. However, targeting and delivery of LNPs across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) has proven challenging. In an effort to target LNPs composed of an ionizable cationic lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), cholesterol, the phospholipid 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), and 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 (DMG-PEG 2000) to particular cell types, as well as to generate LNPs that can cross the BBB, we developed and assessed two approaches. The first was centered on the BBB-penetrating trans-activator of transcription (Tat) peptide or the peptide T7, and the other on RNA aptamers targeted to glycoprotein gp160 from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), a HIV-1 coreceptor. We report herein a CCR5-selective RNA aptamer that acts to facilitate entry through a simplified BBB model and that drives the uptake of LNPs into CCR5-expressing cells, while the gp160 aptamer did not. We further observed that the addition of cell-penetrating peptides, Tat and T7, did not increase BBB penetration above the aptamer-loaded LNPs alone. Moreover, we found that these targeted LNPs exhibit low immunogenic and low toxic profiles and that targeted LNPs can traverse the BBB to potentially deliver drugs into the target tissue. This approach highlights the usefulness of aptamer-loaded LNPs to increase target cell specificity and potentially deliverability of central-nervous-system-active RNAi therapeutics across the BBB.","Ray, Roslyn M; Hansen, Anders Højgaard; Taskova, Maria; Jandl, Bernhard; Hansen, Jonas; Soemardy, Citra; Morris, Kevin V; Astakhova, Kira",Beilstein J Org Chem,24,20

Deregulated inflammasome-mediated release of interleukin-1 family cytokines is important in hyper-inflammatory syndromes, like happens in SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytokine release syndrome. We propose that an intense inflammasome formation characterizes the lungs of patients with fatal COVID-19 disease due to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: Samples from four patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia who had been hospitalized at the Hospital of the University of Trieste (Italy) and died of ARDS and four lung samples from a historical repository from subjects who had died of cardiopulmonary arrest and had not been placed on mechanical ventilation and without evidence of pulmonary infection at postmortem examination were collected. Pathology samples had been fixed in formalin 10% at time of collection and subsequently embedded in paraffin. We conducted staining for ASC (Apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein containing a Caspase recruitment domain), NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 3), and cleaved caspase-1. RESULTS: Intense expression of the inflammasome was detected, mainly in leukocytes, within the lungs of all patients with fatal COVID-19 in the areas of lung injury. The number of ASC inflammasome specks per high power fields was significantly higher in the lungs of patients with fatal COVID-19 as compared with the lungs of control subjects (52 ± 22 vs 6 ± 3, P = 0.0064). CONCLUSIONS: These findings identify the presence of NLRP3 inflammasome aggregates in the lungs of fatal COVID-19 pneumonia thus providing the potential molecular link between viral infection and cytokine release syndrome.

In this study, we aimed at assessing the coverage rates for those vaccinations in the pre-mandatory era among students at the School of Medicine of Padua University studying the degree course in medicine and surgery (future physicians) on the basis of the vaccination certificates presented during health surveillance. The vaccinations considered were those against pertussis, rubella, mumps, measles, varicella, Haemophilus influenzae type b (which became mandatory in 2017), pneumococcus, meningococcus C and meningococcus B (only suggested and offered for free since 2017). The study enrolled 4706 students of medicine and surgery. High vaccine uptake was observed, especially in younger students (born after 1990), with vaccines against pertussis, rubella, mumps and measles. Good completion for Haemophilus influenzae type b and meningococcus C was also observed. Very low coverage rates (all under 10%) for vaccination against varicella, pneumococcus and meningococcus B were observed. In conclusion, uptake for some non-mandatory vaccines was below the recommended threshold, although younger generations showed a higher uptake, possibly as a results of policy implemented at the national level. Our findings support the idea to consider health surveillance visits also as an additional opportunity to overcome confidence and convenience barriers and offer vaccine administration.","Bertoncello, Chiara; Nicolli, Annamaria; Maso, Stefano; Fonzo, Marco; Crivellaro, Mariaangiola; Mason, Paola; Trevisan, Andrea",Vaccines (Basel),24,24

TMH was originally conceived in 1932 as a philanthropic project by the Tatas, an elite Parsi business family in Bombay. The founding of TMH represented a form of philanthro-capitalism which both enabled the Tatas to foster a communal acceptance for big businesses in Bombay and provide the Tatas with the opportunity to place stakes in the emerging nuclear research economy seen as essential to the scientific nationalist sentiment of the post-colonial state. In doing this, the everyday activities of TMH placed a heavy emphasis on nuclear research. In a time when radium for the treatment of cancer was still seen as ‘quackery’ in much of the world, the philanthro-capitalist investment and the interest in nuclear research by the post-colonial state provided an environment where radium medicine was able to be validated. The validation of radiotherapy at TMH influenced how other cancer hospitals in India developed and also provided significant resources for cancer research in early-mid twentieth century India. Ultimately, this article identifies ways in which cancer comes to be seen as relevant in the global south and raises questions on the relationship between local and global actors in setting health priorities.","Smith, Robert D.",Biosocieties,24,21

This study assessed body condition score (BCS) of show dogs of six selected popular breeds at a major Swedish dog show event and examined the association between BCS and performance in competition. RESULTS: At one of Sweden’s largest dog shows, BCS of 120 dogs of six different breeds was assessed by trained animal healthcare personnel, using a 9-point BCS scale with conditional cut-off for overweight set to BCS ≥ 6. Prevalence of overweight in the cohort was 32% but all overweight dogs except one displayed only slight overweight (BCS 6) and no dog was assessed as obese (BCS 8–9). Prevalence of overweight differed significantly between breeds (P < 0.0001) with Labrador retrievers, Golden retrievers and French bulldogs showing the highest mean BCS (5.6–5.7) and highest prevalence of overweight (50–67%). Lean and overweight dogs received awards and higher show awards (certificates) to the same extent, and no significant association between slight overweight and performance in competition was found. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of overweight in Swedish show dogs was relatively high and in the same range as in the Swedish dog population as a whole. Dog owners, breeders and judges should be made aware of canine obesity problems and trained in BCS assessment, to better prevent canine overweight and associated health risks. This is particularly important for retriever and brachycephalic breeds, which showed high prevalence of slight overweight and have breed-specific health problems exacerbated by overweight. Owners and breeders of traditionally sturdy dog breeds should be informed that overweight dogs do not outperform lean dogs in competition.

Timely access to quality health care information during outbreaks of infectious diseases can be effective to curtail the spread of disease and feelings of anxiety. Although existing studies have extended our knowledge about online health information–seeking behavior, processes, and motivations, rarely have the findings been applied to an outbreak. Moreover, there is relatively little recent research on how people in China are using the internet for seeking health information during a pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore how people in China are using the internet for seeking health information during a pandemic. Drawing on previous research of online health information seeking, this study asks the following research questions: how was the “#COVID-19 Patient Seeking Help” hashtag being used by patients in Wuhan seeking health information on Weibo at the peak of the outbreak? and what kinds of health information were patients in Wuhan seeking on Weibo at the peak of the outbreak? METHODS: Using entity identification and textual analysis on 10,908 posts on Weibo, we identified 1496 patients with COVID-19 using “#COVID-19 Patient Seeking Help” and explored their online health information–seeking behavior. RESULTS: The curve of the hashtag posting provided a dynamic picture of public attention to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many patients faced difficulties accessing offline health care services. In general, our findings confirmed that the internet is used by the Chinese public as an important source of health information. The lockdown policy was found to cut off the patients’ social support network, preventing them from seeking help from family members. The ability to seek information and help online, especially for those with young children or older adult members during the pandemic. A high proportion of female users were seeking health information and help for their parents or for older adults at home. The most searched information included accessing medical treatment, managing self-quarantine, and offline to online support. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the findings contribute to our understanding of health information–seeking behaviors during an outbreak and highlight the importance of paying attention to the information needs of vulnerable groups and the role social media may play.","Zhao, Xiaoman; Fan, Ju; Basnyat, Iccha; Hu, Baijing",J Med Internet Res,24,20

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the role of internet hospitals during the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: Online epidemic-related consultations from multicenter internet hospitals in China during the COVID-19 epidemic were collected. The counselees were described and classified into seven type groups. Symptoms were recorded and compared with reported patients with COVID-19. Hypochondriacal suspicion and offline visit motivation were detected within each counselees’ group to evaluate the social panic of the epidemic along with the consequent medical-seeking behaviors. The counselees’ motivation and the doctors’ recommendation for an offline visit were compared. Risk factors affecting the counselees’ tendency of hypochondriacal suspicion and offline visit motivation were explored by logistic regression models. The epidemic prevention and control measures based on internet hospitals were listed, and the corresponding effects were discussed. RESULTS: A total of 4913 consultations were enrolled for analysis with the median age of the counselees at 28 years (IQR 22-33 years). There were 104 (2.12%) healthy counselees, 147 (2.99%) hypochondriacal counselees, 34 (0.69%) exposed counselees, 853 (17.36%) mildly suspicious counselees, 42 (0.85%) moderately suspicious counselees, 3550 (72.26%) highly suspicious counselees, and 183 (3.72%) severely suspicious counselees. A total of 94.20% (n=4628) of counselees had epidemic-related symptoms with a distribution similar to those of COVID-19. The hypochondriacal suspicion (n=2167, 44.11%) was common. The counselees’ motivation and the doctors’ recommendation for offline visits were inconsistent (P<.001) with a Cohen kappa score of 0.039, indicating improper medical-seeking behaviors. Adult counselees (odds ratio [OR]=1.816, P<.001) with epidemiological exposure (OR 7.568, P<.001), shortness of breath (OR 1.440, P=.001), diarrhea (OR 1.272, P=.04), and unrelated symptoms (OR 1.509, P<.001) were more likely to have hypochondriacal suspicion. Counselees with severe illnesses (OR 2.303, P<.001), fever (OR 1.660, P<.001), epidemiological exposure history (OR 1.440, P=.01), and hypochondriacal suspicion (OR 4.826, P<.001) were more likely to attempt an offline visit. Reattending counselees (OR 0.545, P=.002) were less motivated to go to the offline clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Internet hospitals can serve different types of epidemic counselees, offer essential medical supports to the public during the COVID-19 outbreak, reduce the social panic, promote social distancing, enhance the public’s ability of self-protection, correct improper medical-seeking behaviors, reduce the chance of nosocomial cross-infection, and facilitate epidemiological screening, thus, playing an important role on preventing and controlling COVID-19.","Gong, Kai; Xu, Zhong; Cai, Zhefeng; Chen, Yuxiu; Wang, Zhanxiang",J Med Internet Res,24,26

Many neurosurgeons are now using telemedicine technologies for preoperative evaluations and routine outpatient visits. Our goal was to standardize the telemedicine motor neurologic examination, summarize the evidence surrounding clinical use of telehealth technologies, and discuss financial and legal considerations. METHODS: We identified a 12-member panel composed of spine surgeons, fellows, and senior residents at a single institution. We created an initial telehealth strength examination protocol based on published data and developed 10 agree/disagree statements summarizing the protocol. A blinded Delphi method was utilized to build consensus for each statement, defined as > 80% agreement and no significant disagreement using a 2-way binomial test (significance threshold of p < 0.05). Any statement that did not meet consensus was edited and iteratively resubmitted to the panel until consensus was achieved. In the final round, the panel was unblinded and the protocol was finalized. RESULTS: After the first round, 4/10 statements failed to meet consensus (< 80% agreement, and p = 0.031, p = 0.031, p = 0.003, and p = 0.031 statistical disagreement, respectively). The disagreement pertained to grading of strength of the upper (3/10 statements) and lower extremities (1/10 statement). The amended statements clarified strength grading, achieved consensus (> 80% agreement, p > 0.05 disagreement), and were used to create the final telehealth strength examination protocol. CONCLUSION: The resulting protocol was used in our clinic to standardize the telehealth strength examination.

However, because OSD is incapable of signal amplification, the signal-to-noise ratio or the observable signal change may be usually not significant enough to satisfy practical usage. With the purpose to overcome this challenge, herein a more advanced and practical sensing principle is developed with the OSD replaced by an amplifiable nucleic acid circuit, hybridization chain reaction (HCR). The very contagious norovirus (NoV) was employed as the model target. Compared with LAMP-OSD, the LAMP-HCR can detect as few as 30 copies of NoV gene in 2% fecal samples with significantly enlarged signal change and signal-to-background ratio. Therefore, more reliable detection is achieved. Moreover, due to the high compatibility of HCR, the final LAMP-HCR products can be flexibly transduced into different types of readouts, including fluorescence, flow cytometer (FCM) and even a personal glucose meter (PGM). This further enlarges the operating environments for the detection from hospital labs, bedsides, to potential off-the-shelf devices in local pharmacies. Especially when using FCM or PGM, with the assistance of magnetic beads (MBs), the detection shows even higher tolerance capability to complicated biological matrices.","Dong, Qing; Liu, Quanyi; Guo, Lulu; Li, Dan; Shang, Xudong; Li, Bingling; Du, Yan",Anal Chim Acta,24,14

A rapid review of COVID-19 CMGs found that most lacked methodological rigour, overlooked many at-risk populations, and had variations in treatment recommendations. Furthermore, social science literature highlights the complexity of implementing guidelines in local contexts where they were not developed and the resulting potential to compound health inequities. The aim of this study was to evaluate access to, inclusivity of, and implementation of Covid-19 CMGs in different settings. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of clinicians worldwide from 15 June to 20 July 2020, to explore access to and implementation of Covid-19 CMGs and treatment and supportive care recommendations provided. Data on accessibility, inclusivity, and implementation of CMGs. were analyzed by geographic location. Results: Seventy-six clinicians, from 27 countries responded, 82% from high-income countries, 17% from low-middle income countries. Most respondents reported access to Covid-19 CMG and confidence in implementation of these. However, many respondents, particularly from LMICs reported barriers to implementation, including limited access to treatments and equipment. Only 20% of respondents reported having access to CMGs covering care for children, 25% for pregnant women and 50% for older adults (>65 years). Themes emerging were for CMGs to include recommendations for different at-risk populations, and settings, include supportive care guidance, be readily updated as evidence emerges, and CMG implementation supported by training, and access to treatments recommended. Conclusion: Our findings highlight important gaps in Covid-19 CMG development and implementation challenges during a pandemic, particularly affecting different at-risk populations and lower resourced settings. The findings highlight a need for a new, harmonized evidence-based, that is inclusive and adaptable for different context, incorporating implementation support, to improve access in evidence-based care recommendations during an emergency.","Pilbeam, C.; Malden, D.; Newell, K.; Dagens, A.; Kennon, K.; Michelen, M.; Gobat, N.; Sigfrid, L.",,24,22

Due to its high conservativeness and low similarity with human genes, SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) is one of the most favorable drug targets. However, the current understanding of the molecular mechanism of M(pro) inhibition is limited by the lack of reliable binding affinity ranking and prediction of existing structures of M(pro)–inhibitor complexes. This work integrates mathematics (i.e., algebraic topology) and deep learning (MathDL) to provide a reliable ranking of the binding affinities of 137 SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) inhibitor structures. We reveal that Gly143 residue in M(pro) is the most attractive site to form hydrogen bonds, followed by Glu166, Cys145, and His163. We also identify 71 targeted covalent bonding inhibitors. MathDL was validated on the PDBbind v2016 core set benchmark and a carefully curated SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor dataset to ensure the reliability of the present binding affinity prediction. The present binding affinity ranking, interaction analysis, and fragment decomposition offer a foundation for future drug discovery efforts.","Nguyen, Duc Duy; Gao, Kaifu; Chen, Jiahui; Wang, Rui; Wei, Guo-Wei",Chemical science,24,5

In this study, a SYBR Green I-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay was established to detect FBoV-1. The melting curve showed a single melting peak at 83.0 ℃. The results of sensitivity showed that the detection limit of the qPCR was 3.87 × 10(1) copies/μL. Of note, the detection limit of the conventional polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) was 3.87 × 10(3) copies/μL. The highest intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV%) were 0.98% and 1.42%, respectively. The positive detection rate of 128 clinical samples using the qPCR and the cPCR was 7.0% (9/128) and 4.7% (6/128), respectively. Taken together, these results indicated that the established qPCR assay has good sensitivity, high specificity, and good reproducibility.

The rapid spread of infections has led to calls for alternative approaches to combat the virus. Nanotechnology is taking root against SARS-CoV-2 through prevention, diagnostics and treatment of infections. In light of the escalating demand for managing the pandemic, a comprehensive review that highlights the role of nanomaterials in the response to the pandemic is highly desirable. This review article comprehensively discusses the use of nanotechnology for COVID-19 based on three main categories: prevention, diagnostics and treatment. We first highlight the use of various nanomaterials including metal nanoparticles, carbon-based nanoparticles and magnetic nanoparticles for COVID-19. We critically review the benefits of nanomaterials along with their applications in personal protective equipment, vaccine development, diagnostic device fabrication and therapeutic approaches. The remaining key challenges and future directions of nanomaterials for COVID-19 are briefly discussed.

While pathogenic viruses may cause severe infections, non-pathogenic viruses may serve as potential markers for the level of immunosuppression. However, neither the complexity of the virome in different compartments nor the dynamics of the virus populations posttransplantation are yet understood. Therefore, in this study the virome was analyzed by metagenomic sequencing in simultaneously withdrawn bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and plasma samples of 15 LTRs. In seven patients, also follow-up samples were investigated for abundance and dynamics of virus populations posttransplantation. Five eukaryotic and two prokaryotic virus families were identified in BAL, and nine eukaryotic and two prokaryotic families in plasma. Anelloviruses were the most abundant in both compartments, followed by Herpes- and Coronaviruses. Virus abundance was significantly higher in LTRs than in healthy controls (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.001). Up to 48 different anellovirus strains were identified within a single LTR. Analyses in the follow-up patients revealed for the first time a highly complex and unique dynamics of individual anellovirus strains in the posttransplantation period. The abundance of anelloviruses in plasma was inversely correlated with that of other eukaryotic viruses (Pearson correlation coefficient r = −0.605; p<0.05). A broad spectrum of virus strains co-exists in BAL and plasma of LTRs. Especially for the anelloviruses, a high degree of co-infections and a highly individual and complex dynamics after transplantation was observed. The biological impact of these findings and their relation to clinical variables remain to be elucidated by future analyses.","Segura-Wang, Maia; Görzer, Irene; Jaksch, Peter; Puchhammer-Stöckl, Elisabeth",PLoS One,24,16

Sputum and NP samples were simultaneously collected and multiplex PCR targeting 16 to 18 viruses were performed. Viruses were detected for 18/30 patients (60%). A high concordance between the sputum and NP samples was observed in 25 (83%) paired samples of which 13 tested positive and 12 tested negative.

Although the effects of other sources of stress on health have been documented, the effects of these unique conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic on the long-term health and well-being of the health care workforce are not known. OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 Study of Healthcare and Support Personnel (CHAMPS) was designed to document early and longitudinal effects of the pandemic on the mental and physical health of essential workers engaged in health care. We will investigate mediators and moderators of these effects and evaluate the influence of exposure to stress, including morbidity and mortality, over time. We will also examine the effect of protective factors and resilience on health outcomes. METHODS: The study cohort is a convenience sample recruited nationally through communities, professional organizations, networks, social media, and snowball sampling. Recruitment took place for 13 months to obtain an estimated sample of 2762 adults who provided self-reported information administered on the web through structured questionnaires about their work environment, mental and physical health, and psychosocial factors. Follow-up questionnaires will be administered after 6 months and annually thereafter to ascertain changes in health, well-being, and lifestyle. Participants who consented to be recontacted form the longitudinal cohort and the CHAMPS Registry may be contacted to ascertain their interest in ancillary studies for which they may be eligible. RESULTS: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and launched in May 2020, with grants from Travere Therapeutics Inc, McKesson Corporation, anonymous donors, and internal funding from the M. Louise Fitzpatrick College of Nursing at Villanova University. Recruitment ended in June 2021 after enrolling 2762 participants, 1534 of whom agreed to participate in the longitudinal study and the registry as well as to be contacted about eligibility for future studies. CONCLUSIONS: The CHAMPS Study and Registry will enable the acquisition of detailed data on the effects of extended psychosocial and workplace stress on morbidity and mortality and serve as a platform for ancillary studies related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Although some rate-limiting steps of the lariciresinol biosynthetic pathway are well known, the specific roles of gene family members in I. indigotica in regulating lariciresinol production are poorly understood. In the present study, a correlation analysis between the RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) expression profile and lignan content by using I. indigotica hairy roots treated with methyl jamonate (0.5 μM) at different time points as a source implicated that I. indigotica pinoresinol/lariciresinol reductase 1 (IiPLR1), but not IiPLR2 or IiPLR3, contributed greatly to lariciresinol accumulation. Gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) demonstrated that IiPLR1 indeed influenced lariciresinol biosynthesis, whereas suppression of IiPLR2 or IiPLR3 did not change lariciresinol abundance significantly. IiPLR1 was thus further characterized; IiPLR1 was constitutively expressed in roots, stems, leaves, and flowers of I. indigotica, with the highest expression in roots, and it responds to different stress treatments to various degrees. Recombinant IiPLR1 reduces both (±)-pinoresinol and (±)-lariciresinol efficiently, with comparative K(cat)/K(m) values. Furthermore, overexpression of IiPLR1 significantly enhanced lariciresinol accumulation in I. indigotica hairy roots, and the best line (ovx-2) produced 353.9 μg g(–1) lariciresinol, which was ~6.3-fold more than the wild type. This study sheds light on how to increase desired metabolites effectively by more accurate or appropriate genetic engineering strategies, and also provides an effective approach for the large-scale commercial production of pharmaceutically valuable lariciresinol by using hairy root culture systems as bioreactors.","Xiao, Ying; Ji, Qian; Gao, Shouhong; Tan, Hexin; Chen, Ruibing; Li, Qing; Chen, Junfeng; Yang, Yingbo; Zhang, Lei; Wang, Zhengtao; Chen, Wansheng; Hu, Zhibi",J Exp Bot,24,33

Besides impact on quality of life, these symptoms (now called Post-COVID-Syndrome) may have an impact on functioning and may also hinder to participation in social life in affected people. However, little is known about developing such syndrome a for patients with mild and moderate COVID-19 who did not need hospitalization or intensive care. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in 1027 patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 was performed in two communities in Bavaria, Germany. The Rehabilitation-Needs-Survey (RehabNeS) including the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) on health-related quality of life, was used. Descriptive statistics were calculated. RESULTS: In all, 97.5% of patients reported one symptom in the infection stage, such as fatigue, respiratory problems, limitations of the senses of taste and smell, fear and anxiety and other symptoms. In this time period, 84.1% of the participants experienced activity limitations and participation restrictions such as carrying out daily routines, handling stress, getting household tasks done, caring for/supporting others, and relaxing and leisure concerns. In all, 61.9% of participants reported persisting symptoms more than 3 months after infection. These were fatigue, sleep disturbances, respiratory problems, pain, fear and anxiety, and restrictions in movement; 49% of the participants reported activity limitations and participation restrictions. Predominately, these were handling stress, carrying out daily routines, looking after one’s health, relaxing and leisure activities and doing house work. The impacts on quality of life and vocational performance were rather low. CONCLUSION: The results show that long-term symptoms after mild and moderate COVID-19 are common and lead to limitations of activities and participation. However, it seems that in most cases they are not severe and do not lead to frequent or serious issues with quality of life or work ability.","Lemhöfer, Christina; Sturm, Christian; Loudovici-Krug, Dana; Best, Norman; Gutenbrunner, Christoph",J Occup Med Toxicol,24,16

DESIGN: Self-controlled case series study using national data on covid-19 vaccination and hospital admissions. SETTING: Patient level data were obtained for approximately 30 million people vaccinated in England between 1 December 2020 and 24 April 2021. Electronic health records were linked with death data from the Office for National Statistics, SARS-CoV-2 positive test data, and hospital admission data from the United Kingdom’s health service (NHS). PARTICIPANTS: 29 121 633 people were vaccinated with first doses (19 608 008 with Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and 9 513 625 with Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2 mRNA)) and 1 758 095 people had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. People aged ≥16 years who had first doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines and any outcome of interest were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were hospital admission or death associated with thrombocytopenia, venous thromboembolism, and arterial thromboembolism within 28 days of three exposures: first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine; first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine; and a SARS-CoV-2 positive test. Secondary outcomes were subsets of the primary outcomes: cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and other rare arterial thrombotic events. RESULTS: The study found increased risk of thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (incidence rate ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 1.47 at 8-14 days) and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (5.27, 4.34 to 6.40 at 8-14 days); increased risk of venous thromboembolism after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (1.10, 1.02 to 1.18 at 8-14 days) and after SARS-CoV-2 infection (13.86, 12.76 to 15.05 at 8-14 days); and increased risk of arterial thromboembolism after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination (1.06, 1.01 to 1.10 at 15-21 days) and after SARS-CoV-2 infection (2.02, 1.82 to 2.24 at 15-21 days). Secondary analyses found increased risk of CVST after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (4.01, 2.08 to 7.71 at 8-14 days), after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination (3.58, 1.39 to 9.27 at 15-21 days), and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test; increased risk of ischaemic stroke after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination (1.12, 1.04 to 1.20 at 15-21 days) and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test; and increased risk of other rare arterial thrombotic events after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (1.21, 1.02 to 1.43 at 8-14 days) and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. CONCLUSION: Increased risks of haematological and vascular events that led to hospital admission or death were observed for short time intervals after first doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines. The risks of most of these events were substantially higher and more prolonged after SARS-CoV-2 infection than after vaccination in the same population.","Hippisley-Cox, Julia; Patone, Martina; Mei, Xue W; Saatci, Defne; Dixon, Sharon; Khunti, Kamlesh; Zaccardi, Francesco; Watkinson, Peter; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Doidge, James; Harrison, David A; Griffin, Simon J; Sheikh, Aziz; Coupland, Carol A C",BMJ,24,22

OBJECTIVES: The recovery of pulmonary functions, exercise capacity, and HRQoL in the survivors of ARDS due to 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 pneumonitis (H1N1‐ARDS) was evaluated in a tertiary teaching hospital in northern Taiwan between May 2010 and June 2011. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data of spirometry, total lung capacity (TLC), diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DL(CO)), and 6‐minute walk distance (6MWD) in the patients survived from H1N1‐ARDS were collected 1, 3, and 6 months post‐hospital discharge. HRQoL was evaluated with St. George respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ). RESULTS: Nine survivors of H1N1‐ARDS in the study period were included. All these patients received 2 months’ pulmonary rehabilitation program. Pulmonary functions and exercise capacity included TLC, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV (1)), DL(CO), and 6MWD improved from 1 to 3 months post‐hospital discharge. Only TLC had further significant improvement from 3 to 6 months. HRQoL represented as the total score of SGRQ had no significant improvement in the first 3 months but improved significantly from 3 to 6 months post‐discharge. CONCLUSION: The impaired pulmonary functions and exercise capacity in the survivors of H1N1‐ARDS improved soon at 3 months after hospital discharge. Their quality of life had keeping improved at 6 months even though there was no further improvement of their pulmonary functions and exercise capacity.","Hsieh, Meng‐Jer; Lee, Wei‐Chun; Cho, Hsiu‐Ying; Wu, Meng‐Fang; Hu, Han‐Chung; Kao, Kuo‐Chin; Chen, Ning‐Hung; Tsai, Ying‐Huang; Huang, Chung‐Chi",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,24,1

We proposed a mixed integer programming model to assign passengers to seats on an airplane in a manner that will respect two types of social distancing. One type of social distancing refers to passengers being seated far enough away from each other. The metric for this type of social distancing is how many passengers are seated so close to each other as to increase the risk of infection. The other type of social distancing refers to the distance between seat assignments and the aisle. That distance influences the health risk involved in passengers and crew members walking down the aisle. Corresponding metrics for both health risks are included in the objective function. To conduct simulation experiments, we define different scenarios distinguishing between the relative level of significance of each type of social distancing. The results suggest the seating assignments that best serve the intention of the scenarios. We also reformulate the initial model to determine seat assignments that maximize the number of passengers boarding an airplane while practicing social distancing among passengers. In the last part of this study, we compare the proposed scenarios with the recommended middle-seat blocking policy presently used by some airlines to keep social distancing among passengers. The results show that the proposed scenarios can provide social distancing among seated passengers similar to the middle-seat blocking policy, while reducing the number of passengers seated close to the aisle of an airplane.","Salari, Mostafa; Milne, R.

There were no synthesized scientific evidences which could show the impact of COVID-19 epidemics/pandemic on essential health services in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impacts of COVID-19 epidemics/pandemic on essential health services provision in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. METHODS: A pre-post study design was used to assess the impacts of COVID-19 on essential health services delivery in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia in the second quarter of 2020 (Post COVID-19) compared to similar quarter in 2019 (Pre COVID-19). The study focuses on five categories; namely; maternal, neonatal and child health care; communicable diseases with a focus on HIV and TB-HIV co-infection; prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV; basic emergency, outpatient, inpatient and blood bank services, non-communicable diseases and road traffic accidents (RTAs). Analysis was done using Stata version 14.0 software package. The effects of COVID-19 epidemics/pandemic were calculated taking the differences between post COVID -19 and pre COVID-19 periods and the levels of service disruptions presented using proportions. Wilcoxon sign rank test was done and a significance level of ≤0.05 was considered as having significant difference among the two quarters. RESULTS: There were significant increase in institutional delivery, delivery by Caesarian Section (CS), still birth, postnatal care within 7 days of delivery, the number of children who received all vaccine doses before 1(st) birthday, the number of under 5 children screened and had moderate acute malnutrition, the number of under 5 children screened and had severe acute malnutrition and children with SAM admitted for management. However, there were significant decrease in HIV testing and detection along with enrolment to antiretroviral therapy (ART) care, number of patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk ≥ 30% received treatment, RTAs, total units of blood received from national blood transfusion service (NBTS) and regional blood banks, total number of units of blood transfused and emergency referral. There were no significant changes in outpatient visits and admissions. CONCLUSION: Despite commendable achievements in maintaining several of the essential health services, COVID-19 has led to an increase in under nutrition in under five children, decline in HIV detection and care, CVD, cervical cancer screening and blood bank services. Therefore, governments, local and international agencies need to introduce innovative ways to rapidly expand and deliver services in the context of COVID-19. Moreover, lower income countries have to customize comprehensive and coordinated community-based health care approaches, including outreach and campaigns. In addition, countries should ensure that NCDs are incorporated in their national COVID-19 response plans to provide essential health care services to people living with NCDs and HIV or HIV-TB co-infection during the COVID-19 pandemic period.","Desta, Abraham Aregay; Woldearegay, Tewolde Wubayehu; Gebremeskel, Estifanos; Alemayehu, Mussie; Getachew, Theodros; Gebregzabiher, Gebremedhin; Ghebremedhin, Kiros Demoz; Zgita, Degnesh Negash; Aregawi, Abera Berhe; Redae, Getachew",PLoS One,24,1

Despite all benefits, there might be some threats for younger groups spending their time in quarantine. This study aims to determine the impacts of lockdown and school closure on children’s major lifestyle aspects, especially their leisure and sleep pattern during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For the purpose of this study, an online questionnaire was distributed from 14th to 31st of March 2020 among the schools and students from the first grade to the 12th grade (before university) in Fars province, southern Iran. The questionnaire consisted of five sections which included data regarding the students’ general information, activity priorities, adherence to quarantine, attitude toward school closure, and sleep patterns. RESULTS: In our study, 20,697 filled questionnaires were received from the participants with an average age of 13.76 years; 29.7% of them were male, 80.6% were from urban areas, and 83.3% were from public schools. The overall first preference of students during school closure was mobile and computer games (30.1%), followed by studying (26.6%) and watching television (13.8%). Our results demonstrated that the majority of students adhered to social distancing and there was also a significant correlation among education levels and desire for schools to be closed till the end of the semester (P = 0.015). Also, regarding sleep patterns, the majority (53.5%) had above 12 h of sleep throughout the day. CONCLUSION: It seems that lockdown following COVID-19 pandemic has changed various aspects of the students’ lifestyle remarkably, especially by increasing screen time and even sleep duration and pattern. We believe that certain strategies should be implemented by the Health and Educational Ministry to control not only the visible side effects of the quarantine period, but also the collateral consequences on their psychological and mental health.

Meanwhile, AI-products are increasingly endowed with emotional characteristics. That is, they are designed and trained to elicit emotions in humans, to recognize human emotions and, sometimes, to simulate emotions (EAI). The introduction of such systems in our lives is met with some criticism. There is a rather strong intuition that there is something wrong about getting attached to a machine, about having certain emotions towards it, and about getting involved in a kind of affective relationship with it. In this paper, I want to tackle these worries by focusing on the last aspect: in what sense could it be problematic or even wrong to establish an emotional relationship with EAI-systems? I want to show that the justifications for the widespread intuition concerning the problems are not as strong as they seem at first sight. To do so, I discuss three arguments: the argument from self-deception, the argument from lack of mutuality, and the argument from moral negligence.","Weber-Guskar, Eva",Ethics Inf Technol,24,3

This need incentivizes stakeholders to develop border control strategies that fully evaluate health risks if mandatory quarantines are lifted. In this study, we have employed a computational approach to investigate the contact tracing integrated policy in different border-reopening scenarios in Hong Kong, China. Explicitly, by reconstructing the COVID-19 transmission from historical data, specific scenarios with joint effects of digital contact tracing and other concurrent measures (i.e., controlling arrival population and community nonpharmacological interventions) are applied to forecast the future development of the pandemic. Built on a modified SEIR epidemic model with a 30% vaccination coverage, the results suggest that scenarios with digital contact tracing and quick isolation intervention can reduce the infectious population by 92.11% compared to those without contact tracing. By further restricting the inbound population with a 10,000 daily quota and applying moderate-to-strong community nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs), the average daily confirmed cases in the forecast period of 60 days can be well controlled at around 9 per day (95% CI: 7–12). Two main policy recommendations are drawn from the study. First, digital contact tracing would be an effective countermeasure for reducing local virus spread, especially when it is applied along with a moderate level of vaccination coverage. Second, implementing a daily quota on inbound travelers and restrictive community NPIs would further keep the local infection under control. This study offers scientific evidence and prospective guidance for developing and instituting plans to lift mandatory border control policies in preparing for the global economic recovery.","Yu, Zidong; Zhu, Xiaolin; Liu, Xintao; Wei, Tao; Yuan, Hsiang-Yu; Xu, Yang; Zhu, Rui; He, Huan; Wang, Hui; Wong, Man Sing; Jia, Peng; Guo, Song; Shi, Wenzhong; Chen, Wu",Int J Environ Res Public Health,24,1

Method In this retrospective study, COVID19 patients under invasive mechanical ventilation at (XXX) were included. The patients were divided in two age groups, those aged ≥ 50 years and < 50 years. Clinical parameter of these patients like blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and body temperature were recorded at the time of mechanical ventilation and 24, 48 and 72 hours under the mechanical ventilation. Result A total of 317 patients were included in the study where 214 patients were over the age of 50 years and 98 were under 50 years. The mean age of patients was 59.71±16.46 year. At the start of mechanical ventilation and 24, 48 and 72 hours during the ventilation, blood pressure, pulse rate, rate of respiration, oxygen saturation, Glasgow coma scale and temperature were not significantly different at among the two age groups, p>0.05, respectively.

Studies with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have highlighted the role of herbal medicines either in combination with antiviral drugs or by themselves in curtailing the severity of infection and associated inflammation. Divya-Swasari-Vati is an Indian ayurvedic formulation used in the treatment of chronic cough and lung inflammation, which is one of the first symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections. METHODS: In this study, we used a A549 cell xenotransplant in the swim bladder of zebrafish and modeled the SARS-CoV-2 infection by injecting the fish with a recombinant spike protein. The different groups were given normal feed or feed mixed with either dexamethasone (as the control drug) or Divya-Swasari-Vati. The changes in behavioral fever, infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells in the swim bladder, degeneration or presence of necrotic cells in the kidney, and gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines were studied to determine the rescue of the diseased phenotype. RESULTS: Challenge with the spike protein caused changes in the swim bladder cytology with infiltrating pro-inflammatory cells, skin hemorrhage, and increase in behavioral fever. This was also accompanied by increased mortality of the disease control fish. Treatment with Divya-Swasari-Vati reversed most of the disease symptoms including damage to the kidney glomerulocytes, and complete reversal of behavioral fever. Dexamethasone, used as a comparator, was only able to partly rescue the behavioral fever phenotype. Divya-Swasari-Vati also suppressed the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α, levels in a dose-dependent manner, under in vivo and in vitro conditions. CONCLUSION: The study showed that the A549 xenotransplanted zebrafish injected with the recombinant spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is an efficient model for the disease; and treatment with Divya-Swasari-Vati medicine rescued most of the inflammatory damage caused by the viral spike protein while increasing survival of the experimental fish.","Balkrishna, Acharya; Verma, Sudeep; Solleti, Siva Kumar; Khandrika, Lakshmipathi; Varshney, Anurag",J Inflamm Res,24,23

Surprisingly, patients with a defect of IRAK-4, a critical kinase downstream from TLRs, are resistant to common viruses. We show here that IFN-α/β and -λ induction via TLR-7, TLR-8, and TLR-9 was abolished in IRAK-4-deficient blood cells. In contrast, IFN-α/β and -λ were induced normally by TLR-3 and TLR-4 agonists. Moreover, IFN-β and -λ were normally induced by TLR-3 agonists and viruses in IRAK-4-deficient fibroblasts. We further show that IFN-α/β and -λ production in response to 9 of 11 viruses tested was normal or weakly affected in IRAK-4-deficient blood cells. Thus, IRAK-4-deficient patients may control viral infections by TLR-3- and TLR-4-dependent and/or TLR-independent production of IFNs. The TLR-7-, TLR-8-, and TLR-9-dependent induction of IFN-α/β and -λ is strictly IRAK-4 dependent and paradoxically redundant for protective immunity to most viruses in humans.","Yang, Kun; Puel, Anne; Zhang, Shenying; Eidenschenk, Céline; Ku, Cheng-Lung; Casrouge, Armanda; Picard, Capucine; von Bernuth, Horst; Senechal, Brigitte; Plancoulaine, Sabine; Al-Hajjar, Sami; Al-Ghonaium, Abdulaziz; Maródi, László; Davidson, Donald; Speert, David; Roifman, Chaim; Garty, Ben-Zion; Ozinsky, Adrian; Barrat, Franck J.; Coffman, Robert L.; Miller, Richard L.; Li, Xiaoxia; Lebon, Pierre; Rodriguez-Gallego, Carlos; Chapel, Helen; Geissmann, Frédéric; Jouanguy, Emmanuelle; Casanova, Jean-Laurent",Immunity,24,16

Many doctors are physically and emotionally exhausted, neglecting families, self-care, patient empathy and innovative thinking about complex health issues. Exposure to clinical work hours demonstrated a dose effect with burnout, suggesting cause and effect, affecting up to 80% of doctors. To retain good doctors, their complex needs must be recognised and allowances made for flexible work options. TAKING A RISK: George Hospital, a large regional training hospital in a rural district, converted some full-time medical officer posts to part-time posts. This was in response to doctors’ requests for more flexible work options, often after returning from maternity leave or in response to burnout. Perceived risks revolved around institutional resource security and that part-time post vacancies would be difficult to fill. REAPING THE BENEFITS: Employing doctors in part-time posts has created stability and continuity in the health team. The hospital had generated a cohort of young professionals who care with empathy and have emotional resilience to train others and plough their skills back into the healthcare service. CONCLUSION: Reducing working hours and creating flexible options were concrete ways of promoting resilience and retaining competent doctors.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to effectively prioritize patients who are symptomatic for testing to assist early COVID-19 detection in Brazil, addressing problems related to inefficient testing and control strategies. METHODS: Raw data from 55,676 Brazilians were preprocessed, and the chi-square test was used to confirm the relevance of the following features: gender, health professional, fever, sore throat, dyspnea, olfactory disorders, cough, coryza, taste disorders, and headache. Classification models were implemented relying on preprocessed data sets; supervised learning; and the algorithms multilayer perceptron (MLP), gradient boosting machine (GBM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR). The models’ performances were analyzed using 10-fold cross-validation, classification metrics, and the Friedman and Nemenyi statistical tests. The permutation feature importance method was applied for ranking the features used by the classification models with the highest performances. RESULTS: Gender, fever, and dyspnea were among the highest-ranked features used by the classification models. The comparative analysis presents MLP, GBM, DT, RF, XGBoost, and SVM as the highest performance models with similar results. KNN and LR were outperformed by the other algorithms. Applying the easy interpretability as an additional comparison criterion, the DT was considered the most suitable model. CONCLUSIONS: The DT classification model can effectively (with a mean accuracy≥89.12%) assist COVID-19 test prioritization in Brazil. The model can be applied to recommend the prioritizing of a patient who is symptomatic for COVID-19 testing.","Viana dos Santos Santana, Íris; CM da Silveira, Andressa; Sobrinho, Álvaro; Chaves e Silva, Lenardo; Dias da Silva, Leandro; Santos, Danilo F S; Gurjão, Edmar C; Perkusich, Angelo",J Med Internet Res,24,8

Moreover, the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) relative to vaccination in rural areas is uncertain. We addressed this knowledge gap through using an improved statistical stochastic method based on the Galton–Watson branching process, considering both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Data included 1136 SARS-2-CoV infections of the rural outbreak in Hebei, China, and 135 infections of the urban outbreak in Tianjin, China. We reconstructed SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains and analyzed the effectiveness of vaccination and NPIs by simulation studies. The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 showed strong heterogeneity in urban and rural areas, with the dispersion parameters k = 0.14 and 0.35, respectively (k < 1 indicating strong heterogeneity). Although age group and contact-type distributions significantly differed between urban and rural areas, the average reproductive number (R) and k did not. Further, simulation results based on pre-control parameters (R = 0.81, k = 0.27) showed that in the vaccination scenario (80% efficacy and 55% coverage), the cumulative secondary infections will be reduced by more than half; however, NPIs are more effective than vaccinating 65% of the population.

From October 2019 to July 2020, we conducted nine pre- and six post-switch to biosimilar interviews with BC, English speaking participants, who were 18 years or older, and were currently taking a biologic medication. Participants were interviewed pre- and post-switch to a biosimilar medication and interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim for qualitative analysis.

Results suggested that anxiety positively predicted both affective coping styles and negatively predicted the action-planning coping style, while COVID-19 worry predicted all coping styles; presence of meaning in life positively predicted both rational coping styles and negatively predicted the avoidant coping style, while search for meaning positively predicted all coping styles; individualism negatively predicted the passive-submissive style and positively predicted the action-planning style, whereas collectivism predicted all coping styles; furthermore, individualism and collectivism moderated the link between anxiety and the passive-submissive coping style, presence of meaning in life moderated the link between anxiety and avoidant coping style, while search for meaning in life moderated the link between anxiety and the action-planning coping style. Overall, the findings enrich the cultural transactional theory of stress and coping, and generate insights for the culture-sensitive approach to the meaning in life. The results were conceptualized vis-a-vis Georgia’s intermediate position between clear-cut individualism and clear-cut collectivism.","Shekriladze, Ia; Javakhishvili, Nino; Chkhaidze, Nino",Front Psychol,24,21

METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with WHO interim guidance in three Grade ⅢA hospitals of Jiangsu from Jan 22 to Feb 14, 2020. Real time RT-PCR was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples. RESULTS: Of the 80 patients infected with COVID-19, 41 patients were female, with a median age of 46.1 years. Except for 3 severe patients, the rest of the 77 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. 9 patients were unconfirmed until a third-time nucleic acid test. 38 cases had a history of chronic diseases. The main clinical manifestations of the patients were fever and cough, which accounted for 63 cases (78.75%) and 51 cases (-63.75%) respectively. Only 3 patients (3.75%) showed liver dysfunction. Imaging examination showed that 55 patients (-68.75%) showed abnormal, 25 cases (31.25%) had no abnormal density shadow in the parenchyma of both lungs. Up to now, 21 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patient died. The average length of stay for discharged patients was 8 days. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the cases in Wuhan, the cases in Jiangsu exhibited mild or moderate symptoms and no obvious gender susceptivity. The proportion of patients having liver dysfunction and abnormal CT imaging was relatively lower than that of Wuhan. Notably, infected patients may be falsely excluded based on two consecutively negative respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid test results.","Wu, Jian; Liu, Jun; Zhao, Xinguo; Liu, Chengyuan; Wang, Wei; Wang, Dawei; Xu, Wei; Zhang, Chunyu; Yu, Jiong; Jiang, Bin; Cao, Hongcui; Li, Lanjuan",Clin Infect Dis,24,20

While randomized clinical trials were in various stages of development and enrollment, there was an urgent need for widespread access to potential therapeutic agents particularly for vulnerable racial and ethnic minority populations who were disproportionately affected by the pandemic. The objective of this study is to report on the demographic, geographic, and chronological access to COVID 19 convalescent plasma in the US via the EAP. Methods and findings Mayo Clinic served as the central IRB for all participating facilities and any US physician could participate as local physician-principal investigator. Registration occurred through the EAP central website. Blood banks rapidly developed logistics to provide convalescent plasma to hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Demographic and clinical characteristics of all enrolled patients in the EAP were summarized. Temporal trends in access to COVID-19 convalescent plasma were investigated by comparing daily and weekly changes in EAP enrollment in response to changes in infection rate on a state level. Geographical analyses on access to convalescent plasma included assessing EAP enrollment in all national hospital referral regions as well as assessing enrollment in metropolitan and less populated areas which did not have access to COVID-19 clinical trials. From April 3 to August 23, 2020, 105,717 hospitalized patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 were enrolled in the EAP. A majority of patients were older than 60 years of age (57.8%), male (58.4%), and overweight or obese (83.8%). There was substantial inclusion of minorities and underserved populations, including 46.4% of patients with a race other than White, and 37.2% of patients were of Hispanic ethnicity. Severe or life-threatening COVID-19 was present in 61.8% of patients and 18.9% of patients were mechanically ventilated at time of convalescent plasma infusion. Chronologically and geographically, increases in enrollment in the EAP closely followed confirmed infections across all 50 states. Nearly all national hospital referral regions enrolled patients in the EAP, including both in metropolitan and less populated areas. Conclusions The EAP successfully provided widespread access to COVID-19 convalescent plasma in all 50 states, including for underserved racial and ethnic minority populations. The efficient study design of the EAP may serve as an example framework for future efforts when broad access to a treatment is needed in response to a dynamic disease affecting demographic groups and areas historically underrepresented in clinical studies.","Senefeld, J.

However, to date, Africa has secured enough COVID-19 vaccine doses for less than 5% of its population. With widespread vaccination not on the horizon for Africa, there is a strong emphasis on non-pharmaceutical interventions which include movement restrictions (lockdowns). This general COVID-19 pandemic response of imposing lockdowns, however, neglects to factor in non-fatal consequences leading to disruption socio-economic wellbeing of the society at large. The economy in most African countries can no longer sustain lockdown restrictions. Some studies have indicated that a hard lockdown statistical value of the extra lives saved would be dwarfed by its long-term cost. At the same time not responding to the threat of the pandemic will cost lives and disrupts the social fabric.

METHODS: A questionnaire in the form of a Google survey was sent to ophthalmologists across India on May 1, 2021. The data collected until May 11, 2021 was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 1057 ophthalmologists all over India participated in the survey. Of the respondents, 559 (52.9%) were women and 730 (69.1%) were young ophthalmologists (below the age of 40 years). Salary reduction was reported by 569 (53.8%) of the respondents. The categories suffering the maximum salary reduction were – young ophthalmologists (407, 55.8%) (P < 0.001), women (304, 54.4%) (P < 0.001), and private sector employees (457, 67%) (P < 0.001). More women ophthalmologists (438, 78.4%) felt it was unfair to reduce the salary during the pandemic, as compared to men (330, 66.3%) (P < 0.001). A reduction in surgical training opportunities was reported by 689 (65.2%) of ophthalmologists. The categories who suffered the maximum loss of surgical training opportunities were young ophthalmologists (565, 77.4%) (P < 0.001), women ophthalmologists (415, 74.2%) (P < 0.001), and ophthalmologists in the government sector (147, 82.6%) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Ophthalmologists in India, especially women and the younger professionals, had to face salary reduction and loss of surgical training opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most ophthalmologists in India do not favor a reduction in salary. There is a need to formulate policies to safeguard ophthalmologists, especially women and younger generation from future crises in training, employment, and income.","Edakhlon, Sreeni; Mohan, Prashob; Pillai, Gopal S; Verma, Lalit; Honavar, Santosh G; Sharma, Namrata; Nadaraj, Ambily",Indian J Ophthalmol,24,5

The transmission of such pathogens to humans may lead to self-sustaining chains of transmission. These pathogens represent the highest risk for future pandemics. For their prevention, the transmission over the species barrier — although rare — should, by all means, be avoided. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, surprisingly though, most of the current research concentrates on the control by drugs and vaccines, while comparatively little scientific inquiry focuses on future prevention. Already in 2012, the World Bank recommended to engage in a systemic One Health approach for zoonoses control, considering integrated surveillance-response and control of human and animal diseases for primarily economic reasons. First examples, like integrated West Nile virus surveillance in mosquitos, wild birds, horses and humans in Italy show evidence of financial savings from a closer cooperation of human and animal health sectors. Provided a zoonotic origin can be ascertained for the COVID-19 pandemic, integrated wildlife, domestic animal and humans disease surveillance-response may contribute to prevent future outbreaks. In conclusion, the earlier a zoonotic pathogen can be detected in the environment, in wildlife or in domestic animals; and the better human, animal and environmental surveillance communicate with each other to prevent an outbreak, the lower are the cumulative costs.","Zinsstag, Jakob; Utzinger, Jürg; Probst-Hensch, Nicole; Shan, Lv; Zhou, Xiao-Nong",Infect Dis Poverty,24,16

Only the son had heart failure, with reduced ejection fraction and atrial fibrillation. This report aims to show that age and baseline comorbidities are not always predictors of severe COVID-19 disease. CASE REPORTS: Case 1: The son, a 29-year-old man, presented with dyspnea and palpitation. His nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). He required high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy and had new-onset atrial fibrillation and reduced ejection fraction. Case 2: The father, a 54-year-old man, presented with dyspnea. Nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. He required regular nasal cannula oxygen therapy. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm. Echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction. Case 3: The grandfather, an 84-year-old man with a history of atrial flutter, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension, presented with dyspnea and fever.

Inflammatory cytokine production constitutes a hallmark of COVID-19 that is facilitated by inability of adaptive immunity to control virus invasion. The effect of cytokine release syndrome is deleterious, but the severity of it depends on other confounding factors: age and comorbidities. In this study, we analyze the literature data on the post-transplant course of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplanted (alloHSCT) patients, which is affected by generated inflammatory cytokines. The sequence of events boosting cytokine production was analyzed in relation to clinical and laboratory data highlighting the impact of cytokine generation on the post-transplant course. The collected data were compared to those from studies on COVID-19 patients. The similarities are: (i) the damage/pathogen-associated molecular pattern (DAMP/PAMP) stage is similar except for the initiation hit being sterile in alloHSCT (toxic damage of conditioning regimen) and viral in COVID-19; (ii) genetic host-derived factors play a role; (iii) adaptive immunity fails, DAMP signal(s) increases, over-production of cytokines occurs; (iv) monocytes lacking HLADR expression emerge, being suppressor cells hampering adaptive immunity; (v) immune system homeostasis is broken, the patient’s status deteriorates to bed dependency, leading to hypo-oxygenation and malnutrition, which in turn stimulates the intracellular alert pathways with vigorous transcription of cytokine genes. All starts with the interaction between DAMPs with appropriate receptors, which leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the inflammatory process spreads, tissue is damaged, DAMPs are released and a vicious cycle occurs. Attempts to modify intracellular signaling pathways in patients with post-alloHSCT graft vs host disease have already been undertaken. The similarities documented in this study show that this approach may also be used in COVID-19 patients for tuning signal transduction processes to interrupt the cycle that powers the cytokine overproduction.","Lange, Andrzej; Lange, Janusz; Jaskuła, Emilia",Front Immunol,24,21

Only scarce information is available about the diversity of viruses present in the faeces of pigs. Here we describe a protocol, which was optimized for the purification of the total fraction of viral particles from pig faeces. The genomes of the purified DNA and RNA viruses were simultaneously amplified by PCR and subjected to deep sequencing followed by bioinformatic analyses. The efficiency of the method was monitored using a process control consisting of three bacteriophages (T4, M13 and MS2) with different morphology and genome types. Defined amounts of the bacteriophages were added to the sample and their abundance was assessed by quantitative PCR during the preparation procedure. RESULTS: The procedure was applied to a pooled faecal sample of five pigs. From this sample, 69,613 sequence reads were generated. All of the added bacteriophages were identified by sequence analysis of the reads. In total, 7.7% of the reads showed significant sequence identities with published viral sequences. They mainly originated from bacteriophages (73.9%) and mammalian viruses (23.9%); 0.8% of the sequences showed identities to plant viruses. The most abundant detected porcine viruses were kobuvirus, rotavirus C, astrovirus, enterovirus B, sapovirus and picobirnavirus. In addition, sequences with identities to the chimpanzee stool-associated circular ssDNA virus were identified. Whole genome analysis indicates that this virus, tentatively designated as pig stool-associated circular ssDNA virus (PigSCV), represents a novel pig virus. CONCLUSION: The established protocol enables the simultaneous detection of DNA and RNA viruses in pig faeces including the identification of so far unknown viruses. It may be applied in studies investigating aetiology, epidemiology and ecology of diseases. The implemented process control serves as quality control, ensures comparability of the method and may be used for further method optimization.","Sachsenröder, Jana; Twardziok, Sven; Hammerl, Jens A.; Janczyk, Pawel; Wrede, Paul; Hertwig, Stefan; Johne, Reimar",PLoS One,24,26

METHOD: From baseline, axial length growth over six months was measured prospectively. Subjects were then initiated on atropine 0.01% if axial length growth was greater than 0.1mm per 6 months (fast progressors), axial length and spherical equivalent change measurements recorded every six months. The rate of change was compared to the baseline pre-treatment rate. If axial length change was below the threshold, subjects received monitoring only. RESULTS: 73 subjects were identified as fast progressors and commenced atropine 0.01%, (mean baseline refraction of OD -2.9±1.6, OS -2.9±1.8 and a mean baseline axial length OD 24.62 ± 1.00 mm, OS 24.53 ± 0.99 mm). At six months, the mean paired difference of axial length growth rate was significantly reduced by 50% of baseline (all 73 subjects, p<0.05). 53 subjects followed to 12 months, and 12 to 24 months maintained a reduced growth rate. Change in mean spherical equivalent was significantly reduced compared to pre-treatment refractive error (mean paired difference p<0.05) and at each subsequent visit. 91 children were slow progressors and remained untreated. Their axial length growth rate did not change significantly out to 24 months. Spherical equivalent changed less than -0.5D annually in this group. CONCLUSION: Identifying fast progressors before treatment initiation demonstrated a strong treatment effect with atropine 0.01% reducing their individual rate of myopia progression by 50%. Another large group of myopic children, slow progressors, continued without medical intervention.

METHODS: Perinatal women, attending 14 healthcare facilities in Cape Town, were enrolled in the study during baseline data collection before the COVID-19 lockdown. During the lockdown period, fieldworkers telephonically contacted the perinatal women who were enrolled in the study and had provided contact details. The following data were collected from those who consented to the study: socio-demographic information, mental health assessment, food insecurity status and experiences of domestic violence. Poisson regression was used to model the associations of a number of risk factors with the occurrence of CMDs. RESULTS: Of the 2149 women enrolled in the ASSET study, 885 consented to telephonic interviews. We found that 12.5% of women had probable CMDs and 43% were severely food insecure. Psychological distress increased significantly during the lockdown period, compared to before the COVID-19 outbreak. Using multivariate Poisson regression modelling, we showed that the risk of CMDs was increased in women who were severely food insecure or who experienced psychological or sexual abuse. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on the mental health status of perinatal women living in low-resource settings in Cape Town and highlights how a crisis such as the COVID-19 lockdown amplifies the psycho-social risk factors associated with CMDs in perinatal women.

Little is known about its suitability or perceived helpfulness for Indigenous peoples. This study explored the cultural utility of SMART Recovery in an Australian Aboriginal context. METHODS: An Indigenous‐lensed, multi‐methods, exploratory study design was used to develop initial evidence of: (i) attributes of Aboriginal SMART Recovery facilitators and group members; (ii) characteristics of Aboriginal‐led SMART Recovery groups; (iii) perceived acceptability and helpfulness of SMART Recovery; and (iv) areas for potential improvement. Data were collected by synthesising Indigenous qualitative methods (research topic and social yarning) with western qualitative and quantitative methods (participant surveys, program adherence rating scale, group observations and field notes). Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants were a culturally diverse sample of male and female Aboriginal facilitators (n = 10) and group members (n = 11), aged 22–65 years. Aboriginal‐led SMART Recovery groups were culturally customised to suit local contexts. Program tools ‘goal setting’ and ‘problem solving’ were viewed as the most helpful. Suggested ways SMART Recovery could enhance its cultural utility included: integration of Aboriginal perspectives into facilitator training; creation of Aboriginal‐specific program and marketing materials; and greater community engagement and networking. Participants proposed an Aboriginal‐specific SMART Recovery program. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study offers insights into Aboriginal peoples' experiences of SMART Recovery. Culturally‐informed modifications to the program were identified that could enhance cultural utility. Future research is needed to obtain diverse community perspectives and measure health outcomes associated with group attendance.","Dale, Elizabeth; Lee, K. S.

To deeply reveal the interaction of host and SARS-CoV, based on the basic structural feature of pathogen-associated molecular pattern, we created a new bioinformatics method for searching potential pathogenic molecules and identified a set of SARS-CoV specific GU-rich ssRNA fragments with a high-density distribution in the genome. In vitro experiments, the result showed the representative SARS-CoV ssRNAs had powerful immunostimulatory activities to induce considerable level of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-12 release via the TLR7 and TLR8, almost 2-fold higher than the strong stimulatory ssRNA40 that was found previously from other virus. Moreover, SARS-CoV ssRNA was able to cause acute lung injury in mice with a high mortality rate in vivo experiment. It suggests that SARS-CoV specific GU-rich ssRNA plays a very important role in the cytokine storm associated with a dysregulation of the innate immunity. This study not only presents new evidence about the immunopathologic damage caused by overactive inflammation during the SARS-CoV infection, but also provides a useful clue for a new therapeutic strategy.","Li, Yan; Chen, Ming; Cao, Hongwei; Zhu, Yuanfeng; Zheng, Jiang; Zhou, Hong",Microbes Infect,24,1

METHODS: A literature review of articles published in English language and reported outcomes on prevalence and effect of diabetes on outcomes and patients’ characteristics. RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes in COVID‐19 patients appears similar to that in the general population. The evidence of diabetes increasing the risk of severe infection and adverse outcomes is substantial. The progression of the disease into acute respiratory distress syndrome, the requirement for intensive care admission or mechanical ventilation and mortality all have been increased by the presence of diabetes. Patients with diabetes at risk of COVID‐19 appear to be obese, of older age, have uncontrolled glycaemia and have coexisting comorbidities especially cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Tight glycaemic control on admission to hospital using insulin infusion has shown some beneficial effects; however, the role of hypoglycaemic medications in the management of these patients is not yet clear.

Such phylodynamic inferences often complement or even substitute for conventional surveillance data, particularly when sampling is poor or delayed. It remains generally unknown, however, how robust phylodynamic epidemiological inferences are, especially when there is uncertainty regarding pathogen prevalence and sampling intensity. Here, we use recently developed mathematical techniques to fully characterize the information that can possibly be extracted from serially collected viral phylogenetic data, in the context of the commonly used birth-death-sampling model. We show that for any candidate epidemiological scenario, there exists a myriad of alternative, markedly different, and yet plausible “congruent” scenarios that cannot be distinguished using phylogenetic data alone, no matter how large the data set. In the absence of strong constraints or rate priors across the entire study period, neither maximum-likelihood fitting nor Bayesian inference can reliably reconstruct the true epidemiological dynamics from phylogenetic data alone; rather, estimators can only converge to the “congruence class” of the true dynamics. We propose concrete and feasible strategies for making more robust epidemiological inferences from viral phylogenetic data.","Louca, Stilianos; McLaughlin, Angela; MacPherson, Ailene; Joy, Jeffrey B; Pennell, Matthew W",Mol Biol Evol,24,24

To control the spread of the disease, screening large numbers of suspected cases for appropriate quarantine and treatment is a priority. Pathogenic laboratory testing is the gold standard but is time-consuming with significant false negative results. Therefore, alternative diagnostic methods are urgently needed to combat the disease. Based on COVID-19 radiographical changes in CT images, we hypothesized that Artificial Intelligence's deep learning methods might be able to extract COVID-19's specific graphical features and provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus saving critical time for disease control. Methods and Findings: We collected 1,065 CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases (325 images) along with those previously diagnosed with typical viral pneumonia (740 images). We modified the Inception transfer-learning model to establish the algorithm, followed by internal and external validation.

Case studies of emergency resuscitation, intubation, and ventilation each illustrate breathing's sociality, as people and machines move air both materially and immaterially. Amid the hospital's rationing of life support technologies, forms of life that seem to be self‐regulated are better understood as relational movements of breath. Social breathing stands to reshape our understanding of the biopolitics of intensive care by drawing attention to uncertain techniques of the body. These techniques move at the hinge between person and environment, self and other, public and private health care systems, and medicine and machine. Life's valuation at this hinge takes shape through breath moving against its limits. Ultimately, the article argues that it is crucial to understand how ventilators mediate the edges of life and death by tracing the circulations of life support as the movements of life itself. As patients, families, and hospital workers struggle to make and manage breath, we might better grapple with the social relations that emerge as life support shapes life.","Solomon, Harris",Med Anthropol Q,24,33

Newly diagnosed PLHIV may require more intensive care early in their treatment course, yet frequent appointments can be burdensome to patients and health systems. Determining the optimal parameters for defining clinical stability and transitioning to less frequent appointments could decrease patient burden and health system costs. The objectives of this pilot study are to explore the feasibility and acceptability of (1) reducing the time to DSD from 12 to 6 months after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, and (2) reducing the number of suppressed viral loads required to enter DSD from two to one. METHODS AND ANALYSES: The present study is a pilot, unblinded trial taking place in three health facilities in Kigali, Rwanda. Current Rwandan guidelines require PLHIV to be on ART for ≥12 months with two consecutive suppressed viral loads in order to transition to less frequent appointments.

The goal of this study was to develop models that predict outcome using parameters collected at admission to the hospital. METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a retrospective single-center cohort study of COVID-19 patients at the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City, China. Forty-three demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters collected at admission plus discharge/death status, days from COVID-19 symptoms onset and days of hospitalization were analyzed. From 157 patients, 120 were discharged and 37 died. Pearson correlations showed that hypertension and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were associated with death and respiratory distress parameters. A penalized logistic regression model efficiently predicts the probability of death with 13 of 43 variables. A regularized Cox regression model predicts the probability of survival with 7 of above 13 variables. SBP but not hypertension was a covariate in both mortality and survival prediction models. SBP was elevated in deceased compared to discharged COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Using an unbiased approach, we developed models predicting outcome of COVID-19 patients based on data available at hospital admission. This can contribute to evidence-based risk prediction and appropriate decision-making at hospital triage to provide the most appropriate care and ensure the best patient outcome. High SBP, a cause of end-organ damage and an important comorbid factor, was identified as a covariate in both mortality and survival prediction models.","Caillon, Antoine; Zhao, Kaiqiong; Klein, Kathleen Oros; Greenwood, Celia; Lu, Zhibing; Paradis, Pierre; Schiffrin, Ernesto L",Am J Hypertens,24,28

Using a qualitative-dominant mixed-methods design, we explored informed consent process in Hypothermia for encephalopathy in low and middle-income countries (HELIX) trial conducted in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. METHODS: Term infants with neonatal encephalopathy, aged less than 6 hours, were randomly allocated to cooling therapy or usual care, following informed parental consent. The consenting process was audio-video (A-V) recorded in all cases. We analysed A-V records of the consent process using a 5-point Likert scale on three parameters—empathy, information and autonomy. In addition, we used exploratory observation method to capture relevant aspects of consent process and discussions between parents and professionals. Finally, we conducted in-depth interviews with a subgroup of 20 parents and 15 healthcare professionals. A thematic analysis was performed on the observations of A-V records and on the interview transcripts. RESULTS: A total of 294 A-V records of the HELIX trial were analysed. Median (IQR) score for empathy, information and autonomy was 5 (0), 5 (1) and 5 (1), respectively. However, thematic analysis suggested that the consenting was a ceremonial process; and parental decision to participate was based on unreserved trust in the treating doctors, therapeutic misconception and access to an expensive treatment free of cost. Most parents did not understand the concept of a clinical trial nor the nature of the intervention. Professionals showed a strong bias towards cooling therapy and reported time constraints and explaining to multiple family members as key challenges. CONCLUSION: Despite rigorous research governance and consent process, parental decisions were heavily influenced by situational incapacity and a trust in doctors to make the right decision on their behalf.

Herein, an alternative HCHO chemosensor that based on the tin oxide nanoparticles is proposed, which was obtained through a facile hydrothermal method. Gas sensing performances showed that the optimal working temperature located at only 180 °C, the response value of 79 via 50 ppm HCHO was much higher than that of 35 at 230 °C. However, the compromised test temperature was selected as 230 °C, taking into account the faster response/recovery speeds than 180 °C, named 20/23versus 53/60 s, respectively. The response (35) of the SnO(2) nanoparticles-based sensor to 50 ppm of HCHO is about 400% higher than that of bulk SnO(2) sensor (9), especially when the gas concentration is 1 ppm, SnO(2) nanoparticles also has a higher sensitivity which may possibly result from more exposed active sites and small size effect for nanoparticles than for bulk ones. The gas sensor based on SnO(2) nanoparticles can be utilized as a promising candidate for practical low-temperature detectors of HCHO due to its higher gas response, excellent response–recovery properties, and perfect selectivity.","Gao, Liping; Fu, Hao; Zhu, Jiejun; Wang, Junhai; Chen, Yuping; Liu, Hongjie",J Mater Res,24,16

Objective: To develop and validate a prognostic model based on routine hematological parameters to predict uncomplicated disease progression to support the decision for an earlier discharge. Design: Development and refinement of a multivariable logistic regression model with subsequent external validation. The time course of several hematological variables until four days after admission were used as predictors. Variables were first selected based on subject matter knowledge; their number was further reduced using likelihood ratio-based backward elimination in random bootstrap samples. Setting: Model development based on three Austrian hospitals, validation cohorts from two Austrian and one Swedish hospital. Participants: Model development based on 363 survivors and 78 non-survivors of Covid-19 hospitalized in Austria. External validation based on 492 survivors and 61 non-survivors hospitalized in Austria and Sweden. Outcome: In-hospital death. Main Results: The final model includes age, fever upon admission, parameters derived from C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, platelet count and creatinine concentration, approximating their baseline values (CRP, creatinine) and change over time (CRP, platelet count). In Austrian validation cohorts both discrimination and calibration of this model were good, with c indices of 0.93 (95% CI 0.90 - 0.96) in a cohort from Vienna and 0.93 (0.88 - 0.98) in one from Linz. The model performance seems independent of how long symptoms persisted before admission. In a small Swedish validation cohort, the model performance was poorer (p = 0.008) compared with Austrian cohorts with a c index of 0.77 (0.67 - 0.88), potentially due to substantial differences in patient demographics and clinical routine. Conclusions: Here we describe a formula, requiring only variables routinely acquired in hospitals, which allows to estimate death probabilities of hospitalized patients with Covid-19. The model could be used as a decision support for earlier discharge of low-risk patients to reduce the burden on the health care system. The model could further be used to monitor whether patients should be admitted to hospital in countries with health care systems with emphasis on outpatient care (e.g. Sweden).","Heber, S.; Pereyra, D.; Schrottmaier, W.; Kammerer, K.; Santol, J.; Pawelka, E.; Hana, M.; Scholz, A.; Liu, M.; Hell, A.; Heiplik, K.; Lickefett, B.; Haverall, S.; Traugott, M.; Neuboeck, M.; Schoergenhofer, C.; Seitz, T.; Firbas, C.; Karolyi, M.; Weiss, G.; Jilma, B.; Thalin, C.; Bellmann-Weiler, R.; Salzer, H.; Fischer, M.

METHODS: All eligible patients were interviewed and underwent a physical examination, chest X-ray, and 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Scales to evaluate post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and HRQoL were applied. RESULTS: Of 1,295 patients, 365 suffered ARDS and 166 survived to hospital discharge. Five died after discharge and 48 were lost to follow-up. Of the 113 remaining patients, 81% had persistent symptoms. More than 50% of patients completed less than 80% of the theoretical distance on the 6MWT, 50% had an abnormal X-ray and 93% of patients developed psychiatric disorders. Mean SF-36 scores were worse than in the general population. After multivariate regression analysis, female sex, non-Caucasian race, and Charlson index>2 were independent risk factors for a worse mental health component summary score on the SF-36, and age was associated with a better prognosis. Female sex and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were independently associated with a worse physical component summary score.

We showed that the pandemic would have failed to establish in the US if a nationwide mask mandate, based on using respirators with moderately-high compliance, had been implemented during the first two months of the pandemic. The other mask types would fail to prevent the pandemic from becoming established. When mask usage compliance is low to moderate, respirators are far more effective in reducing disease burden. Using data from the third wave, we showed that the epidemic could be eliminated in the US if at least 40% of the population consistently wore respirators in public. Surgical masks can also lead to elimination, but requires compliance of at least 55%. Daily COVID-19 mortality could be eliminated in the US by June or July 2021 if 95% of the population opted for either respirators or surgical masks from the beginning of the third wave. We showed that the prospect of effective control or elimination of the pandemic using mask-based strategy is greatly enhanced if combined with other nonpharmaceutical interventions that significantly reduce the baseline community transmission. This study further emphasizes the role of human behavior towards masking on COVID-19 burden, and highlights the urgent need to maintain a healthy stockpile of highly-effective respiratory protection, particularly respirators, to be made available to the general public in times of future outbreaks or pandemics of respiratory diseases that inflict severe public health and socio-economic burden on the population.","Ngonghala, C.

METHODS: We included 25 pediatric oncology hospitals in the United States that supported a grant submission to perform a cluster randomized trial in which the intervention encompassed care pathways for symptom management. A survey was distributed to site principal investigators prior to randomization to measure contextual elements related to care pathway implementation. Questions included the inner setting measures of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), study-specific potential barriers and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical research. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare characteristics of institutions that agreed that their department supported the implementation of symptom management care pathways vs. institutions that did not agree. RESULTS: Of the 25 sites, one withdrew because of resource constraints and one did not respond, leaving 23 institutions. Among the seven CFIR constructs, the least supported was implementation climate; 57% agreed there was support, 39% agreed there was recognition and 39% agreed there was prioritization for symptom management care pathway implementation at their institution. Most common barriers were lack of person-time to create care pathways and champion their use (35%), lack of interest from physicians (30%) and lack of information technology resources (26%). Most sites reported no negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across research activities. Sites with fewer pediatric cancer patients were more likely to agree that staff are supported to implement symptom management care pathways (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The most commonly reported barriers to implementation were lack of support, recognition and prioritization. The COVID-19 pandemic may not be a major barrier to clinical research activities in pediatric oncology.

We aimed to determine if commercial serology assays can detect vaccine-induced antibodies (VIAs) and understand the vaccination response. METHODS This cohort study recruited healthcare workers and residents of long-term care facilities (receiving the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 products, respectively) who underwent serum collection pre-vaccination (BNT162b2 group), 2-weeks post vaccination (both groups), and pre-2nd dose (both groups). Sera were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using four commercial assays (Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant, DiaSorin Liaison Trimeric S IgG, and GenScript cPASS) to detect VIAs. Secondary outcomes included description of post-vaccination antibody response and correlation with neutralising titers. RESULTS 225 participants (177 receiving BNT162b2 and 48 receiving mRNA-1273) were included (median age 41 years,; 66-78% female). Nucleocapsid IgG was found in 4.1% and 21.9% of the BNT162b2 (baseline) and mRNA-1273 (2-weeks post first dose). All anti-spike assays detected antibodies post-vaccination, with an average increase of 87.2% (range 73.8-94.3%; BNT162b2), and 25.2% (range 23.8-26.7%; mRNA-1273) between the first and last sampling time points (all p<0.05). Neutralising antibodies were detected at all post-vaccine timepoints for both vaccine arms, with increasing titers over time (all p<0.05). CONCLUSION Anti-spike vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 IgG are detectable by commercially available high-throughput assays and increases over time. Prior to second dose of vaccination, neutralising antibodies are detectable in 73-89% of individuals, suggesting the majority of individuals would have some degree of protection from subsequent infection.","Kanji, J.

We collected daily COVID-19 diagnoses and mortality data from the WHO’s daily situation reports dated January 1 to December 31, 2020. We performed three time-series models [simple exponential smoothing, auto-regressive integrated moving average, and automatic forecasting time-series (Prophet)] to identify the global trend of rCFR for COVID-19. We used beta regression models to investigate the association between the rCFR and potential predictors of each country and reported incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of each variable. The weekly global cumulative COVID-19 rCFR reached a peak at 7.23% during the 17th week (April 22–28, 2020). We found a positive and increasing trend for global daily rCFR values of COVID-19 until the 17th week (pre-peak period) and then a strong declining trend up until the 53rd week (post-peak period) toward 2.2% (December 29–31, 2020). In pre-peak of rCFR, the percentage of people aged 65 and above and the prevalence of obesity were significantly associated with the COVID-19 rCFR. The declining trend of global COVID-19 rCFR was not merely because of increased COVID-19 testing, because COVID-19 tests per 1,000 population had poor predictive value. Decreasing rCFR could be explained by an increased rate of infection in younger people or by the improvement of health care management, shielding from infection, and/or repurposing of several drugs that had shown a beneficial effect on reducing fatality because of COVID-19.","Hasan, Mohammad Nayeem; Haider, Najmul; Stigler, Florian L.; Khan, Rumi Ahmed; McCoy, David; Zumla, Alimuddin; Kock, Richard A.; Uddin, Md.

Clinical and histopathologic characteristics are similar across severely affected patients, suggesting that a common mode of immune reaction may be involved in the immunopathogenesis of ARDS. There may be etiologic substances that have an affinity for respiratory cells and induce lung cell injury in cases of ARDS. These substances originate not only from pathogens, but also from injured host cells. At the molecular level, these substances have various sizes and biochemical characteristics, classifying them as protein substances and non-protein substances. Immune cells and immune proteins may recognize and act on these substances, including pathogenic proteins and peptides, depending upon the size and biochemical properties of the substances (this theory is known as the protein-homeostasis-system hypothesis). The severity or chronicity of ARDS depends on the amount of etiologic substances with corresponding immune reactions, the duration of the appearance of specific immune cells, or the repertoire of specific immune cells that control the substances. Therefore, treatment with early systemic immune modulators (corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulin) as soon as possible may reduce aberrant immune responses in the potential stage of ARDS.","Lee, Kyung-Yil",Int J Mol Sci,24,3

METHODS: Literatures which in regard to the intelligent rehabilitation tools of DRF were systematic retrieved from the PubMed, the Cochrane library, Wan Fang, and VIP Data. The effective APPs were systematically screened out through the APP markets of iOS and Android mobile platform, and the functional characteristics of different APPs were evaluated and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 8 literatures and 31 APPs were included, which were divided into four categories: intelligent intervention, angle measurement, intelligent monitoring, and auxiliary rehabilitation games. These APPs provide support for the patients' home rehabilitation guidance and training and make up for the high cost and space limitations of traditional rehabilitation methods. The intelligent intervention category has the largest download ratio in the APP market. Angle measurement tools help DRF patients to measure the joint angle autonomously to judge the degree of rehabilitation, which is the most concentrated type of literature research. Some of the APPs and tools have obtained good clinical verification. However, due to the restrictions of cost, geographic authority, and applicable population, a large number of APPs still lack effective evidence to support popularization. CONCLUSION: Patients with DRF could draw support from different kinds of APPs in order to fulfill personal need and promote self-management. Intelligent rehabilitation APPs play a positive role in the rehabilitation of patients, but the acceptance of the utilization for intelligent rehabilitation APPs is relatively low, which might need follow-up research to address the conundrum.","Chen, Yalan; Yu, Yijun; Lin, Xin; Han, Zhenwei; Feng, Zhe; Hua, Xinyi; Chen, Dongliang; Xu, Xiaotao; Zhang, Yuanpeng; Wang, Guheng",Comput Math Methods Med,24,1

Health care providers (HCPs) who work in the ICU are exposed to a stressful environment and, in the long run, this may lead to exhaustion and burnout. It is observed that the burnout in HCPs in the ICU may have an impact on patient care and the psychological wellbeing of the caregiver. Thus, we aimed to assess the burnout in HCPs working in the ICUs of a tertiary care hospital in South India. METHODS: A single-center, questionnaire-based survey was carried out by HCPs who work in the ICUs of a tertiary care hospital in South India. A Google form link was created after obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee. The link was then circulated to the HCPs who work in the ICU and the responses were collected. The Google form fetched data related to demographics, profession, area of work, duration of work per day, total days of work in the ICU during the work period, and details of night duty. The Oldenburg burnout inventory questionnaire was used to measure burnout in the HCPs. RESULTS: A total of 60 HCPs with a mean age of 23.37±2.93 years, consented and filled out the online questionnaire. Of the 60 HCPs, 41 (68.33%) were females and 19 (31.67%) were males. Most of the participants were working in adult medical ICUs. The overall burnout level in all the participants was 2.39± 0.31, with the exhaustion level being 2.45±0.43 and the disengagement level being 2.32± 0.31. Between 70% and 80% of HCPs experienced high levels of burnout while working in the ICUs. Work area, work duration, sleep duration, and clinical experience had an impact on burnout levels of the HCPs. CONCLUSION: Most of the HCPs who work in the ICU experience high levels of burnout. Lack of clinical experience in the ICU and long work hours with lack of sleep can increase burnout in the HCPs.","Sanil, Meghana; Machado, Glevita; Nayak, Varun R",Can J Respir Ther,24,0

Here, we present an alternative strategy for creating virus-resistant cells and animals by ectopic expression of a nucleic acid hydrolyzing catalytic 3D8 single chain variable fragment (scFv), which has both DNase and RNase activities. HeLa cells (SCH7072) expressing 3D8 scFv acquired significant resistance to DNA viruses. Virus challenging with Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in 3D8 scFv transgenic cells and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay based on direct DNA cleavage analysis revealed that the induced resistance in HeLa cells was acquired by the nucleic acid hydrolyzing catalytic activity of 3D8 scFv. In addition, pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection in WT C57BL/6 mice was lethal, whereas transgenic mice (STG90) that expressed high levels of 3D8 scFv mRNA in liver, muscle, and brain showed a 56% survival rate 5 days after PRV intramuscular infection. The antiviral effects against DNA viruses conferred by 3D8 scFv expression in HeLa cells as well as an in vivo mouse system can be attributed to the nuclease activity that inhibits viral genome DNA replication in the nucleus and/or viral mRNA translation in the cytoplasm. Our results demonstrate that the nucleic-acid hydrolyzing activity of 3D8 scFv confers viral resistance to DNA viruses in vitro in HeLa cells and in an in vivo mouse system.","Lee, Gunsup; Yu, Jaelim; Cho, Seungchan; Byun, Sung-June; Kim, Dae Hyun; Lee, Taek-Kyun; Kwon, Myung-Hee; Lee, Sukchan",PLoS Pathog,24,26

Powder dissolution experiments under non-sink conditions showed similar dissolution profiles for the cocrystals and pure NTZ. However, pre-dissolved cellulosic polymer in the phosphate dissolution medium (pH 7.5) modified the dissolution profile of NTZ when starting from the cocrystals, achieving transient drug supersaturation. Subsequent dissolution studies under sink conditions of polymer-based pharmaceutical powder formulations with NTZ-SUC cocrystals gave a significant improvement of the apparent solubility of NTZ when compared with analogous formulations of pure NTZ and the physical mixture of NTZ and SUC. Scanning electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction analysis of samples recovered after the powder dissolution studies showed that the cocrystals undergo fast dissolution, drug supersaturation and precipitation both in the absence and presence of polymer, suggesting that the solubilization enhancement is due to polymer-induced delay of nucleation and crystal growth of the less soluble NTZ form. The study demonstrates that the incorporation of an appropriate excipient in adequate concentration can be a key factor for inducing and maintaining the solubilization of poorly soluble drugs starting from co-crystallized solid forms. In such a way, cocrystals can be suitable for the development of solid dosage forms with improved bioavailability and efficacy in the treatment of important parasitic and viral diseases, among others.","Salas-Zúñiga, Reynaldo; Rodríguez-Ruiz, Christian; Höpfl, Herbert; Morales-Rojas, Hugo; Sánchez-Guadarrama, Obdulia; Rodríguez-Cuamatzi, Patricia; Herrera-Ruiz, Dea",Pharmaceutics,24,1

Replication-incompetent retroviral vector (retrovector) is an efficient tool to generate stable cell lines. Multiple copies of integrated genes by retrovector transduction results in improved recombinant protein yield. HEK-293 and their genetic derivatives are principal cells for retrovector production. Retrovectors packaged in HEK-293 cells pose a risk of infectious agent transmission, such as viruses and mycoplasmas, from serum and packaging cells. RESULTS: In this report, retrovectors were packaged in CHO cells cultured in chemically defined (CD) media. The retrovectors were then used to transduce CHO cells. This method can block potential transmission of infectious agents from serum and packaging cells. With this method, we generated glucagon-like protein-1 Fc fusion protein (GLP-1-Fc) stable expression CHO cell lines. Productivity of GLP-1-Fc can reach 3.15 g/L. The GLP-1-Fc protein produced by this method has comparable bioactivity to that of dulaglutide (Trulicity). These stable cell lines retain 95–100% of productivity after 40 days of continuous culture (~ 48–56 generations). CONCLUSIONS: Suspension CHO cells are clean, safe, and reliable cells for retrovector packaging. Retrovectors packaged from this system could be used to generate CHO stable cell lines for recombinant protein expression. How to cite: Li J, Wei S, Cao C, et al.
