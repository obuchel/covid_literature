This article examines the impact of urbanization on environmental regulation efficiency (ERE) in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). Based on a panel dataset of 97 cities in the YRB from 2005 to 2016, a spatial econometric model was used for analysis. Results show that the average ERE in the YRB is relatively low and manifests in the shape of a curved smile. The urbanization level of the permanent population is far lower than the average level of developed countries. However, the urbanization level is showing a steady growth trend. During this period, ERE in the Yangtze River middle, upper, and lower reaches was measured at 0.77, 0.58, and 0.52, respectively. The urbanization rate was measured at 0.59, 0.45, and 0.39, in the lower, middle, and upper reaches, respectively. When only considering population urbanization, the previously observed negative correlation between ERE and the Kuznets curve disappears. However, if the carrying capacity of economic activities is considered, the U-shaped relationship between urbanization rate and ERE returns. The environmental Kuznets curve is consequently verified. In addition, there is an inverted U-shaped nonlinear relationship between economic development and ERE. The results of this article show that there are unsustainable risks in the rapid pursuit of population urbanization. Only by improving the quality of urbanization and adapting the level of urbanization to the carrying capacity of resources and environment can we truly promote high-quality economic development. The article puts forward some suggestions to promote the green development of the economy.","Zhang, Qian; Tang, Decai; Bethel, Brandon J.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,709,5

STUDY DESIGN: We performed a single-center, randomized control trial of premature infants born <30 weeks gestation (n = 66), comparing discontinuation of NCPAP from 6 cmH(2)O (CWP) (fast wean arm) to discontinuation at 4 CWP, weaning by 1 CWP per day (slow wean arm). The primary outcome was the total number of days on NCPAP or mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes included wean failure, growth, length of stay, and related comorbidities. RESULTS: Duration of NCPAP or mechanical ventilation was longer in the slow wean arm compared to the fast wean arm (17 vs 12 days, p = 0.03). There were no differences observed in secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: In weaning NCPAP, abrupt discontinuation may be associated with a shorter duration of positive pressure respiratory support compared to a gradual weaning strategy.","Duyka, Brittany; Beaullieu, Claire; Khan, Amir M.",J Perinatol,709,5

Since the industrialization period, the harsh living conditions of cities and the outbreak of infectious diseases have promoted the coordinated development of urban planning and public health, and people have gradually realized the importance of urban design and planning to the health of residents. After searching keywords related to health city and urban planning, and excluding repeated, non-English, and unrelated papers, this work retrieved 2582 documents as the basic data (timespan is 1 January 1981–31 December 2020, retrieval time is 28 January 2021). Additionally, CiteSpace was used to analyze document co-citation, cooperation network, and topic co-occurrence. Subsequently, random forest algorithm was used to predict the probability of citation. Overall, this work found that the hot spots of healthy urban planning are physical activity, green space, urban green space, and mental health. It also shows the diversification of themes and the development trend of cross-fields in the field of healthy urban planning. In addition, the article found that two factors, namely, the average number of citations of the first author and whether the article belongs to the field of environmental research, have a great impact on the number of citations of the article. This work is of practical significance to relevant practitioners and researchers, because it provides guidance for hot topics and future research directions in the field of healthy urban planning.","Jia, Bingyao; Chen, Yuting; Wu, Jing",Int J Environ Res Public Health,709,5

Intestinal viruses are closely integrated with these bacterial communities, yet the composition and clinical significance of these communities in CAP patients are unknown. The aims of this exploratory study were to characterise the composition of the rectal bacteriome and virome at hospital admission for CAP, and to determine if microbiota signatures correlate with clinical outcomes. Methods We performed a prospective observational cohort study in CAP patients, admitted to a university or community hospital in the Netherlands between October 2016 and July 2018, and controls. Rectal bacteriome and virome composition were characterised using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and virus discovery next-generation sequencing, respectively. Unsupervised multi-omics factor analysis was used to assess the co-variation of bacterial and viral communities, which served as primary predictor. The clinical outcomes of interest were the time to clinical stability and the length of hospital stay. Findings 64 patients and 38 controls were analysed. Rectal bacterial alpha (p = 0•0015) and beta diversity (r(2)=0•023, p = 0•004) of CAP patients differed from controls. Bacterial and viral microbiota signatures correlated with the time to clinical stability (hazard ratio 0•43, 95% confidence interval 0•20–0•93, p = 0•032) and the length of hospital stay (hazard ratio 0•37, 95% confidence interval 0•17–0•81, p = 0•012), although only the latter remained significant following p-value adjustment for examining multiple candidate cut-points (p = 0•12 and p = 0•046, respectively). Interpretation This exploratory study provides preliminary evidence that intestinal bacteriome and virome signatures could be linked with clinical outcomes in CAP. Such exploratory data, when validated in independent cohorts, could inform the development of a microbiota-based diagnostic panel used to predict clinical outcomes in CAP.

Given that the innate immune response is key to controlling the scale and nature of developing adaptive immune responses, targeting natural killer (NK) cells that can promote a T-helper type 1 (Th1)-type immune response through the production of interferon-γ (IFNγ) remains an untapped strategic target for improved vaccination approaches. Here, we investigate metabolic and functional responses of NK cells to simian adenovirus prime and MVA boost vaccination in a cohort of healthy volunteers receiving a dual HCV-HIV-1 vaccine. Early and late timepoints demonstrated metabolic changes that contributed to the sustained proliferation of all NK cells. However, a strong impact of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) on some metabolic and functional responses in NK cells was observed in HCMV seropositive participants. These changes were not restricted to molecularly defined adaptive NK cells; indeed, canonical NK cells that produced most IFNγ in response to vaccination were equally impacted in individuals with latent HCMV. In summary, NK cells undergo metabolic changes in response to vaccination, and understanding these in the context of HCMV is an important step towards rational vaccine design against a range of human viral pathogens.","Woods, Elena; Zaiatz-Bittencourt, Vanessa; Bannan, Ciaran; Bergin, Colm; Finlay, David K.; Hoffmann, Matthias; Brown, Anthony; Turner, Bethany; Makvandi-Nejad, Shokouh; Vassilev, Ventzi; Capone, Stefania; Folgori, Antonella; Hanke, Tomáš; Barnes, Eleanor; Dorrell, Lucy; Gardiner, Clair M.",NPJ Vaccines,709,5

Intensity and type of health effects depend on many factors such as the type, density, and diversity of bioaerosols in hospital environments. Therefore, identifying and determining their distribution in hospital environment contribute to reduce their adverse effects and maintain the physical health of patients and staff, as well as find the source of infections and possible allergies due to the presence of bioaerosols. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine the type and concentration of the bacterial and fungal bioaerosols, and their distribution in the indoor and outdoor air of a teaching hospital to establish a reference for future studies or measures. The air samples were collected with a one-stage Anderson sampler and particle mass counter for a period of four months in the fall and winter of 2019. In total, 262 bacterial and fungal samples were collected from the air of the wards of Tohid Hospital, Sanandaj, Iran. Antibiotic resistance test, bacterial identification by PCR method, and modeling the dispersion of concentrations of bio-aerosols were also conducted. In order to identify bacteria and fungi, some biochemical and molecular tests and microscopic and macroscopic characteristic methods were applied, respectively. The results showed that the highest and lowest densities of the bioaerosols were observed in lung and operating wards (336.67 and 15.25 CFU/m(3)). Moreover, the highest and least concentrations of particles were seen in the emergency and operating wards, respectively. The most common fungi isolated from the hospital air were Penicillium (24.7%), Cladosporium (23. 4%), Aspergillus niger (13.3%), and Aspergillus Flavus (11.4%). Furthermore, the highest concentration of the isolated bacterium was Staphylococcus hemolyticus (31.84%). Most bacteria showed the highest resistance to gentamicin. The overall average hospital air pollution to bioaerosols was slightly higher than the standards proposed by international organizations. Due to the high concentration of bioaerosols and particles in the studied hospital, providing suitable conditions such as temperature, humidity, proper ventilation, and intelligent air conditioning system using efficient ventilation systems, and restricting the entrance of wards can reduce airborne particles in hospital environment.","Yousefzadeh, Ameneh; Maleki, Afshin; Athar, Saeed Dehestani; Darvishi, Ebrahim; Ahmadi, Manochehr; Mohammadi, Ebrahim; Tang, Van Tai; Kalmarzi, Rasoul Nassiri; Kashefi, Hajar",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,709,5

However, the intergenerational effects of CHM on offspring and the underlying mechanism of CHM remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the effects and the underlying mechanism of CHM, specifically the Bu-Shen-Tian-Jing formula (BSTJF), on model rats with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and the neurobehavioral alterations of female offspring born to PCOS rats administered BSTJF. METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS) and network pharmacology analysis were performed to identify the active ingredients and potential targets of BSTJF. Moreover, PCOS model rats were used to validate the role of BSTJF in reproduction and progeny neural development and to confirm the network pharmacological targets. RESULTS: A total of 91 constituents were characterized from BSTJF. The 20 most significant KEGG pathways and the high-frequency genes of these pathways were predicted to be putative targets of these molecules. The rat experiment showed that the downregulation of FOS protein expression in the ovarian granulosa cells of the PCOS group was reversed by BSTJF. The target residence time of the 5-week-old female offspring of the BSTJF group was higher than that of the PCOS group in the water maze experiment. Compared to the PCOS group, the changes in dendritic spine density, ultrastructure of neurons and synapses, and Gabrb1 and Grin2b protein expression levels in the hippocampus of female offspring were partially reversed in the BSTJF group. CONCLUSIONS: BSTJF can effectively improve ovarian follicle development in PCOS rats and has positive effects on pubertal neurobehavioral alterations in the female offspring of these rats by reversing dendritic spine density, the ultrastructure of neurons and synapses, and the Gabrb1 and Grin2b protein expression levels in the hippocampus.

Objective: to describe the effect of off-label intravenous use of Sarilumab in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia. Design: Observational clinical cohort study. Setting: Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS as Italian Covid reference center. Participants: Patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and respiratory distress with PaO2/FiO2 ratio<300 treated with Sarilumab between March 23rd - April 4th, 2020. Date of final follow-up was April 18, 2020. Main outcomes and measures: We describe the clinical outcomes of 53 patients with SARS-CoV-2 severe pneumonia treated with intravenous Sarilumab in terms of pulmonary function improvement or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rate in medical wards setting and of live discharge rate in ICU treated patients as well as in terms of safety. Each patient received Sarilumab 400 mg administered intravenously on day 1, with eventual additional infusion based on clinical judgement, and was followed for at least 14 days, unless previously discharged or dead. No gluco-corticosteroids were used at baseline. Results: Of the 53 SARS-CoV-2pos patients receiving Sarilumab, 39 (73.6%) were treated in medical wards (66.7% with a single infusion) while 14 (26.4%) in ICU (92.6% with a second infusion). The median PaO2/FiO2 of patients in the Medical Ward was 146(IQR:120-212) while the median PaO2/FiO2 of patients in ICU was 112(IQR:100-141.5), respectively. Within the medical wards, 7(17.9%) required ICU admission, 4 of whom were re-admitted to the ward within 5-8 days. At 19 days median follow-up, 89.7% of medical inpatients significantly improved (46.1% after 24 hours, 61.5% after 3 days), 70.6% were discharged from the hospital and 85.7% no longer needed oxygen therapy. Within patients receiving Sarilumab in ICU, 64.2% were discharged from ICU to the ward and 35.8% were still alive at the last follow-up. Overall mortality rate was 5.7% after Sarilumab administration: 1(2.5%) patient died in the Medical Ward whilst 2(14.2%) patients died in ICU, respectively. Conclusions and relevance: IL6-R inhibition appears to be a potential treatment strategy for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and intravenous Sarilumab seems a promising treatment approach showing, in the short term, an important clinical benefit and good safety.","Gremese, Elisa; Cingolani, Antonella; Bosello, Silvia Laura; Alivernini, Stefano; Tolusso, Barbara; Perniola, Simone; Landi, Francesco; Pompili, Maurizio; Murri, Rita; Santoliquido, Angelo; Garcovich, Matteo; Sali, Michela; Pascale, Gennaro De; Gabrielli, Maurizio; Biscetti, Federico; Montalto, Massimo; Tosoni, Alberto; Gambassi, Giovanni; Rapaccini, Gian Ludovico; Iaconelli, Amerigo; Verme, Lorenzo Zileri Dal; Petricca, Luca; Fedele, Anna Laura; Lizzio, Marco Maria; Tamburrini, Enrica; Natalello, Gerlando; Gigante, Laura; Bruno, Dario; Verardi, Lucrezia; Taddeo, Manuela; Calabrese, Angelo; Lombardi, Francesco; Bernabei, Roberto; Cauda, Roberto; Franceschi, Francesco; Landolfi, Raffaele; Richeldi, Luca; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Fantoni, Massimo; Antonelli, Massimo; Gasbarrini, Antonio",,709,10

The level of mitigation, defined by measures to slow down the spread of the infection, is characterized by the infection transmissivity. It is determined by people's mobility, frequency of contacts, and probability to catch the virus from a contact. In the absence of testing the infected people are isolated for a finite period of time during which they are symptomatic. In the presence of testing, people become isolated a soon as they are tested positive. We compute time dependence of daily new infections as a function of transmissivity, initial infection, and testing. The duration of the epidemic increases rapidly with the increased level of mitigation while the number of people falling sick daily decreases. Testing, regardless of the level, has little effect on the duration of the epidemic. The total number of people who contract the disease over the lifetime of the epidemic depends weakly on its duration. It does not change significantly for the homogeneous testing of the population at the level below 10% daily.","Garanin, D. A.; Chudnovsky, E. M.",,709,16

Liquidity provisions in electronic customer-to-customer trading increased, though at prohibitively high costs. By improving dealer funding conditions and providing a liquidity backstop, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility and the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) stabilized trading conditions.

We evaluate the temporal COVID-19 infection behavior among HCW-D, HCW-A, and non-HCW. Methods: From February 2020 to April 2021, trained nurses recorded age, gender, occupation, and symptoms in a COVID-19 testing outpatient health center. We allocated data into weekly time fractals and calculated the proportion of COVID-19 positive among HCW vs. non-HCW and incorporated an ARFIMA model (traditionally used in weather forecast) to predict future cases of COVID-19. Results: Among 8,998 COVID-19 RT-PCR tests, 3,462 (42%) patients were HCW-D, and 933 (11%) were HCW-A. Overall, 1,914 (21.3%) returned positive, representing 27%, 25% and 19% of HCW-D, HCW-A and non-HCW, respectively. HCW-D or HCW-A were significantly more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than non-HCW (OR=1.5, p<0.0001). The percentage of positive to negative test results remained steady over time. In the positive cases, the percentage of HCW to non-HCW declined significantly over time (Mann-Kendal trend test: tau=-0.58, p<0.0001). Our ARFIMA model showed a long-memory infection pattern in the occurrence of new COVID-19 cases lasting for months. Average error was 1.9 cases per week comparing predicted to actual values three months later (May-July 2021). Conclusion: HCW have a sustained 50% higher risk of COVID-19 positivity in the pandemic.

Fever has been observed as one of the most common clinical manifestations, although the prevalence and characteristics of fever in adult and paediatric COVID-19 patients is inconclusive. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the overall pooled prevalence of fever and chills in addition to fever characteristics (low, medium, and high temperature) in both adult and paediatric COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The protocol of this systematic review and meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020176327). PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar databases were searched between 1st December 2019 and 3rd April 2020 without language restrictions. Both adult (&#8805;18 years) and paediatric (<18 years) COVID-19 patients were considered eligible. We used random-effects model for the meta-analysis to obtain the pooled prevalence and risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Quality assessment of included studies was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic and Cochran's Q test. Robustness of the pooled estimates was checked by different subgroups and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: We identified 2055 studies, of which 197 studies (n = 24266) were included in the systematic review and 167 studies with 17142 adults and 373 paediatrics were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled prevalence of fever in adult and paediatric COVID-19 patients were 79.43% [95% CI: 77.05-81.80, I2 = 95%] and 45.86% [95% CI: 35.24-56.48, I2 = 78%], respectively. Besides, 14.45% [95% CI: 10.59-18.32, I2 = 88%] of the adult COVID-19 patients were accompanied with chills. In adult COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of medium-grade fever (44.33%) was higher compared to low- (38.16%) and high-grade fever (14.71%). In addition, the risk of both low (RR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.69-3.22, p<0.00001, I2 = 84%) and medium grade fever (RR: 2.79, 95% CI: 2.21-3.51, p<0.00001, I2 = 75%) were significantly higher compared to high-grade fever, however, there was no significant difference between low- and medium-grade fever (RR: 1.17, 95% CI: 0.94-1.44, p = 0.16, I2 = 87%). 88.8% of the included studies were of high-quality. The sensitivity analyses indicated that our findings of fever prevalence for both adult and paediatric patients are reliable and robust. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of fever in adult COVID-19 patients was high, however, 54.14% of paediatric COVID-19 patients did not exhibit fever as an initial clinical feature. Prevalence and risk of low and medium-grade fevers were higher compared to high-grade fever.","Islam, Md Asiful; Kundu, Shoumik; Alam, Sayeda Sadia; Hossan, Tareq; Kamal, Mohammad Amjad; Hassan, Rosline",PLoS One,709,16

Diagnostic capacity was restricted to a small number of reference laboratories, and none of the few available molecular or serological tests had been validated for extensive use in an outbreak setting. In the early weeks of the crisis, key funders stepped in to accelerate research and development efforts, and the WHO took responsibility for steering diagnostic standardization, a role it had successfully played during the West Africa Ebola virus outbreak. Yet when the WHO declared the end of the Zika Public Health Emergency of International Concern in November 2016, diagnostic capacity remained patchy, and few tools were available at the scale required in the countries that bore the brunt of the epidemic, particularly Brazil. This article analyses the limited impact of global R&D efforts on the availability of Zika diagnostic options where they were most needed and for those most vulnerable: women who might have been exposed to the virus during their pregnancy and children born with suspected congenital Zika syndrome. The truncated legacies of testing during the Zika crisis reveal some of the fault lines in the global health enterprise, particularly the limits of ‘emergency R&D’ to operate in geopolitical contexts that do not conform to the ideal type of a humanitarian crisis, or to tackle technical issues that are inextricably linked to domestic struggles over the scope and distribution of biological citizenship. Diagnostic shortcomings, we argue, lie at the heart of the stunning transformation, in less than two years, in the status of Zika: from international public health emergency to neglected disease.","Kameda, Koichi; Kelly, Ann H; Lezaun, Javier; Löwy, Ilana",Soc Stud Sci,709,24

Emerging antibiotic and drug resistances to commonly used anti-neuraminidase agents such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) have highlighted the need to develop new anti-neuraminidase drugs. We obtained a serendipitous complex crystal of the catalytic domain of Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase (CpNanI(CD)) with 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid (CHES) as a buffer. Here, we report the crystal structure of CpNanI(CD) in complex with CHES at 1.24 Å resolution. Amphipathic CHES binds to the catalytic site of CpNanI(CD) similar to the substrate (Neu5Ac) binding site. The 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid moiety and cyclohexyl groups of CHES interact with the cluster of three arginine residues and with the hydrophobic pocket of the CpNanI(CD) catalytic site. In addition, a structural comparison with other bacterial and human neuraminidases suggests that CHES could serve as a scaffold for the development of new anti-neuraminidase agents targeting CpNanI.","Lee, Youngjin; Youn, Hyung-Seop; Lee, Jung-Gyu; An, Jun Yop; Park, Kyoung Ryoung; Kang, Jung Youn; Ryu, Young Bae; Jin, Mi Sun; Park, Ki Hun; Eom, Soo Hyun",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,709,28

The ambiguity of its transmission, the intense desire of self-protection, family, and friends, the unknown impact of catching the disease itself, unstoppable spread, the panic and outright misinformation lead to acute stress reaction syndrome. However, reliable data related to this contagion lack the prevalence of acute stress reaction syndrome and associated factors among Jimma University Medical Centre hospital visitors in Southwestern Ethiopia. AIMS: The main objective of the study was to assess the prevalence and factors associated with acute stress reaction syndrome during the COVID-19 outbreak among Jimma University Medical Centre Hospital visitors, Ethiopia. METHODS: An interviewer-administered cross-sectional study was conducted among 247 visitors of the Jimma University Medical Centre in Ethiopia. The study was conducted within 2 weeks of the first COVID-19 cases detected on 13 March 2020 in Ethiopia. Data on demographic and socioeconomic status were collected during the interview using structured questionnaires. The psychological impact was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and symptoms of insomnia were measured using the Insomnia Severity Index. Social support was evaluated using Oslo three-item Social Support Scale. Logistic regression was employed to determine the associations between dependent and independent variables. Besides, psychosocial stress score was generated using principal component analysis. A paired permutation test was also performed to determine the variability of psychosocial stress between groups. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 30.47 years, and 76.5% of the participants were male. Acute stress reaction syndrome was detected in 44.1% of hospital visitors. Of the participants, 38.5%, 17.4%, 8.5% and 35.6% had a minimal, mild, moderate and severe psychological impact, respectively. Factors positively associated with acute stress reaction syndrome were individuals who perceived that COVID-19 leads to stigma (adjusted OR (AOR): 3.24, 95% CI 1.11 to 9.45), mild insomnia (AOR: 14.74, 95% CI 6.14 to 35.40), moderate to severe insomnia (AOR: 35.1, 95% CI 10.76 to 114.66), low social support (AOR: 4.08, 95% CI 1.31 to 12.67) and governmental employees (AOR: 8.09, 95% CI 1.38 to 47.18). CONCLUSION: The study revealed the existence of a high prevalence of acute stress reaction syndrome during the COVID-19 outbreak among different groups of the community. Therefore, our results will contribute to the global awareness of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Yitayih, Yimenu; Lemu, Yohannes Kebede; Mekonen, Seblework; Mecha, Mohammed; Ambelu, Argaw",BMJ Open,709,22
