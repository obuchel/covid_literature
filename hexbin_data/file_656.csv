14379,Observation of non-Hermitian topology and its bulk–edge correspondence in an active mechanical metamaterial,2020-11-24,"Several pathologies have a direct impact on society, causing public health problems. Pulmonary diseases such as Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are already the third leading cause of death in the world, leaving tuberculosis at ninth with 1.7 million deaths and over 10.4 million new occurrences. The detection of lung regions in images is a classic medical challenge. Studies show that computational methods contribute significantly to the medical diagnosis of lung pathologies by Computerized Tomography (CT), as well as through Internet of Things (IoT) methods based in the context on the health of things. The present work proposes a new model based on IoT for classification and segmentation of pulmonary CT images, applying the transfer learning technique in deep learning methods combined with Parzen’s probability density. The proposed model uses an Application Programming Interface (API) based on the Internet of Medical Things to classify lung images. The approach was very effective, with results above 98% accuracy for classification in pulmonary images. Then the model proceeds to the lung segmentation stage using the Mask R-CNN network to create a pulmonary map and use fine-tuning to find the pulmonary borders on the CT image. The experiment was a success, the proposed method performed better than other works in the literature, reaching high segmentation metrics values such as accuracy of 98.34%. Besides reaching 5.43 s in segmentation time and overcoming other transfer learning models, our methodology stands out among the others because it is fully automatic. The proposed approach has simplified the segmentation process using transfer learning. It has introduced a faster and more effective method for better-performing lung segmentation, making our model fully automatic and robust.","Souza, Luís Fabrício de Freitas; Silva, Iágson Carlos Lima; Marques, Adriell Gomes; Silva, Francisco Hércules dos S.; Nunes, Virgínia Xavier; Hassan, Mohammad Mehedi; de Albuquerque, Victor Hugo C.; Filho, Pedro P.

19096,Out-group animosity drives engagement on social media,2021-06-29,"The qualified presumption of safety (QPS) approach was developed to provide a regularly updated generic pre‐evaluation of the safety of biological agents, intended for addition to food or feed, to support the work of EFSA's Scientific Panels. The QPS approach is based on an assessment of published data for each agent, with respect to its taxonomic identity, the body of relevant knowledge, safety concerns and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance. Safety concerns identified for a taxonomic unit (TU) are, where possible, confirmed at the species/strain or product level and reflected by ‘qualifications’. In the period covered by this statement, no new information was found that would change the status of previously recommended QPS TUs. Schizochytrium limacinum, which is a synonym for Aurantiochytrium limacinum, was added to the QPS list. Of the 78 microorganisms notified to EFSA between October 2020 and March 2021, 71 were excluded; 16 filamentous fungi, 1 Dyella spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium, 7 Escherichia coli, 1 Streptomyces spp., 1 Schizochytrium spp. and 44 TUs that had been previously evaluated. Seven TUs were evaluated: Corynebacterium stationis and Kodamaea ohmeri were re‐assessed because an update was requested for the current mandate. Anoxybacillus caldiproteolyticus, Bacillus paralicheniformis, Enterobacter hormaechei, Eremothecium ashbyi and Lactococcus garvieae were assessed for the first time. The following TUs were not recommended for QPS status: A. caldiproteolyticus due to the lack of a body of knowledge in relation to its use in the food or feed chain, E. hormaechei, L. garvieae and K. ohmeri due to their pathogenic potential, E. ashbyi and C. stationis due to a lack of body of knowledge on their occurrence in the food and feed chain and to their pathogenic potential. B. paralicheniformis was recommended for the QPS status with the qualification ‘absence of toxigenic activity’ and ‘absence of genetic information to synthesize bacitracin’.","Koutsoumanis, Kostas; Allende, Ana; Alvarez‐Ordóñez, Avelino; Bolton, Declan; Bover‐Cid, Sara; Chemaly, Marianne; Davies, Robert; De Cesare, Alessandra; Hilbert, Friederike; Lindqvist, Roland; Nauta, Maarten; Peixe, Luisa; Ru, Giuseppe; Simmons, Marion; Skandamis, Panagiotis; Suffredini, Elisabetta; Cocconcelli, Pier Sandro; Fernández Escámez, Pablo Salvador; Prieto‐Maradona, Miguel; Querol, Amparo; Sijtsma, Lolke; Suarez, Juan Evaristo; Sundh, Ingvar; Vlak, Just; Barizzone, Fulvio; Hempen, Michaela; Herman, Lieve",EFSA J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8262138/,656
19124,Stable individual differences in infants’ responses to violations of intuitive physics,2021-07-06,"BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii is a common nosocomial pathogen that poses a huge threat to global health. Owing to the severity of A. baumannii infections, it became necessary to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of A. baumannii in Chinese hospitals and find the reasons for the high antibiotic resistance rate and mortality. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiologic and genetic characteristics of A. baumannii isolated from patients with hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP), bloodstream infection (BSI) and urinary tract infection (UTI) in China and uncover potential mechanisms for multi-drug resistance and virulence characteristics of A. baumannii isolates. RESULTS: All isolates were classified into two primary clades in core gene-based phylogenetic relationship. Clonal complex 208 (CC208) mainly consisted of ST195 (32 %) and ST208 (24.6 %). CC208 and non-CC208 isolates had carbapenem resistance rates of 96.2 and 9.1 %, respectively. Core genes were enriched in ‘Amino acid transport and metabolism’, ‘Translation’, ‘Energy production and conversion’, ‘Transcription’, ‘Inorganic ion transport and metabolism’ and ‘Cell wall/membrane/envelope synthesis’. Most isolates possessed virulence factors related to polysaccharide biosynthesis, capsular polysaccharide synthesis and motility. Eleven isolates belong to ST369 or ST191 (oxford scheme) all had the virulence factor cap8E and it had a higher positive rate in UTI (35.3 %) than in BSI (18.9 %) and HAP (12.9 %). ABGRI1 antibiotic resistance islands were responsible for streptomycin, tetracycline and sulfonate resistance. The bla(OXA−23) gene was the most probable cause for carbapenem resistance, although the bla(OXA−66) gene with nonsynonymous SNPs (F82L, I129L) was not. CONCLUSIONS: A. baumannii is a genomically variable pathogen that has the potential to cause a range of infectious diseases. There is high proportion of carbapenem resistance in isolates from all three infection sites (HAP, BSI and UTI), which can be attributed to the bla(OXA−23) gene. CC208 is the predominant clone in bla(OXA−23)-carrying A. baumannii that should be monitored. Virulence factors involving bacteria motility and polysaccharide biosynthesis which are widespread in clinical A. baumannii strains deserve our attention.

204911,Using artificial intelligence to improve COVID-19 rapid diagnostic test result interpretation,2021,"BACKGROUND: The extent to which patients with End-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at a higher risk of COVID-19-related death is still unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the ESRD patients at increased risk of COVID-19 -related death and its associated factors. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted on 74 patients with ESRD and 446 patients without ESRD hospitalized for COVID-19 in Alborz province, Iran, from Feb 20 2020 to Apr 26 2020. Data on demographic factors, medical history, Covid-19- related symptoms, and blood tests were obtained from the medical records of patients with confirmed COVID-19. We fitted univariable and multivariable Cox regression models to assess the association of underlying condition ESRD with the COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. Results were presented as crude and adjusted Hazard Ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In the ESRD subgroup, demographic factors, medical history, symptoms, and blood parameters on the admission of survivors were compared with non-survivors to identify factors that might predict a high risk of mortality. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients with ESRD had in-hospital mortality of 37.8% compared to 11.9% for those without ESRD (P value < 0.001). After adjusting for confounding factors, age, sex, and comorbidities, ESRD patients were more likely to experience in-hospital mortality compared to non-ESRD patients (Adjusted HR (95% CI): 2.59 (1.55-4.32)). The Log-rank test revealed that there was a significant difference between the ESRD and non-ESRD groups in terms of the survival distribution (&#967;2 (1) = 21.18, P-value < 0.001). In the ESRD subgroup, compared to survivors, non-survivors were older, and more likely to present with lack of consciousness or O2 saturation less than 93%; they also had lower lymphocyte but higher neutrophil counts and AST concentration at the presentation (all p -values < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that the presence of ESRD would be regarded as an important risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients, especially in those who are older than age 65 years and presented with a lack of consciousness or O2 saturation less than 93%.","Rastad, Hadith; Ejtahed, Hanieh-Sadat; Shafiee, Gita; Safari, Anis; Shahrestanaki, Ehsan; Khodaparast, Zeinab; Hassani, Neda Shafiabadi; Rezaei, Mohammad; Nazari, Morteza; Zakani, Akram; Niksima, Mohammad Mahdi; Azimzadeh, Mehdi; Karimi, Fatemeh; Tajbakhsh, Ramin; Qorbani, Mostafa",BMC Nephrol,,656

209639,A kernel-modulated SIR model for Covid-19 contagious spread from county to continent,2021,"Abstract: India is home to 77 million people with diabetes and has a large number of COVID 19 cases, albeit with a low fatality (&amp;lt;1.5%). Little Indian data is available about the prevalence of diabetes in COVID 19 and its impact on outcomes. This observational prospective study (approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee) was carried out in a designated COVID facility, largely catering to middle and upper socioeconomic classes. A total of 401 (125 F, mean age 54 y, range 19–92 y) consecutive adults hospitalized with COVID-19 infection as proven by positive nasal swab for SARS-CoV2 by RT-PCR were included. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed either by known history or HbA1c≥6.5%. Severity was assessed using the WHO ordinal scale1. Clinical outcomes and markers of inflammation were compared between diabetes and non-diabetes groups. Out of 401 patients, 210 (52.4%) had either diabetes (189,47.1%) or hyperglycemia requiring insulin treatment (21, 5.2%). 152 (37.9%) reported known diabetes, and 37 (9.2%) had preexisting but undiagnosed diabetes (HbA1c≥ 6.5%). People with diabetes were significantly older (mean age 59.9 vs 47.7 y), and had a higher proportion of men (74.6 vs 63.7 %), hypertension (58.7 vs 25%), CAD (13.8 vs 4.2%), and CKD (5.3 vs 0.9%) and a higher mean baseline severity score (3.4±0.7 vs. 3.2±0.5, p-0.000). The diabetes group had a higher number of severe cases (WHO scale≥5) (20.1% vs 9%, p-0.002) and higher mortality (6.3 vs 1.4%, p-0.015). A higher proportion of the diabetes group required ICU admissions (24.3 vs 12.3%, p-0.002), glucocorticoid therapy (78.3 vs 54.2%, p-0.000), oxygen administration (53.4 vs 28.3%, p-0.000), inotropic support (7.4 vs 2.4%, p-0.019), and renal replacement therapy (3.7% vs 0,p-0.005). The mean duration of hospital stay was higher for the diabetes group (10.4 vs 9.1 days, p-0.016). Of those who died, 12/15 (80%) had diabetes. Baseline Hba1c (n=331) showed a significant correlation with outcome severity scores (r 0.136, p-0.013). Markers of inflammatory response, CRP (41.0±4.4 vs. 19.4±3.8, p-0.000), ferritin (404.8±41.6 vs. 258.8±40.2, p-0.012), IL6 (65.5±11.6 vs. 26.9±4.4, p-0.002), LDH (321.8±10.1 vs. 286.8±8.4, p-0.008) were significantly higher in the diabetes group. Procalcitonin and D Dimer did not differ significantly. In conclusion, we report the highest prevalence of diabetes in a hospitalized COVID-19 population so far. The diabetes group had more severe disease and greater mortality. Baseline HbA1c correlated with poor outcomes. The comorbidities could have contributed to these poorer outcomes in the diabetes group. Strategies to improve outcomes in this pandemic it is imperative to include screening for and better control of diabetes.","Mithal, Ambrish Jevalikar Ganesh Sharma Rutuja Singh Anshu Farooqui Khalid J.; Dewan, Arun Budhiraja Sandeep",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,656

213272,Chemical and genetic rescue of in vivo progranulin-deficient lysosomal and autophagic defects,2021,"Coronaviruses are an extensive family of viruses, some of them can produce different kind of human diseases, ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic coronavirus and started in China in December 2019. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a global pandemic. This disease has a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms, predominantly presenting with cough and fever, resulting in a proportion of patients who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It has been argued that severe lung involvement by the virus may also be caused by hyperinflammation and a condition similar to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), which is a clinical syndrome caused by an inadequate response of the immune system to a trigger, whether infectious, neoplastic, metabolic, or rheumatologic, leading to a disproportionate inflammatory reaction. This activated immune response producing an exaggerated release or storm of cytokines responsible for this disease. There are recently publications suggesting that the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms is associated with COVID 19 disease with higher indicators of severity, which motivates the gastroenterologist to explore how the digestive system could impact this hyperinflammation.","Parra-Izquierdo, Viviana; Flórez-Sarmiento, Cristian; Romero-Sánchez, Consuelo",Rev.

After the unforeseen outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the public demand for delivery services has multiplied. Mobile robotic systems inherently offer the potential for minimizing the amount of direct human-to-human interactions with the parcel delivery process. The proposed system-of-systems consists of various complex aspects such as assigning and distributing delivery jobs, establishing and maintaining reliable communication links between the vehicles, as well as path planning and mobility control. In this paper, we apply a system-level perspective for identifying key challenges and promising solution approaches for modeling, analysis, and optimization of UAV-aided parcel delivery. We present a system-of-systems model for UAV-assisted parcel delivery to cope with higher capacity requirements induced by the COVID-19. To demonstrate the benefits of hybrid vehicular delivery, we present a case study focusing on the prioritization of time-critical deliveries such as medical goods. The results further confirm that the capacity of traditional delivery fleets can be upgraded with drone usage. Furthermore, we observe that the delay incurred by prioritizing time-critical deliveries can be compensated with drone deployment. Finally, centralized and decentralized communication approaches for data transmission inside hybrid delivery fleets are compared.","Patchou, Manuel; Sliwa, Benjamin; Wietfeld, Christian",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07877v1.pdf,656
220913,Microstructural design for mechanical-optical multifunctionality in the exoskeleton of the flower beetle Torynorrhina flammea,2021,"The necessity of e-signature has been accepting by all organizations like finance, education, business. With the effect of this, the popularity has been increasing day by day especially uncertainty times such as the Covid-19 pandemic. However, there is a missing gap in the literature about e-signature studies. The literature review showed that the studies on e-signature awareness and the benefits of e-signature usage in any organization or/and the person are not enough. For this reason, the purpose of the study is to develop a valid and reliable scale to use in scientific studies to understand the awareness of users towards e-signature. Therefore, both validity and reliability of scale have been investigated. Through the exploratory factor analysis, the AoE-sign scale has 16 items and 2 subfactors which are ""Awareness"" and ""Benefits"". The factor analysis results indicated that Cronbach Alpha for Awareness was .888, for Benefits was .790 and for the overall scale was .889. Consequently, the study results demonstrated that the AoE-sign scale is reliable and valid tool and the developed scale could be used by top-level managers. in developing countries such as Cyprus, to be able to understand the awareness level of users. Moreover, they can organize staff training on c-signature to make it possible to use e-signature efficiently in the organizations.","Sancar, N.; Cavus, N.",International Conference on Analysis and Applied Mathematics,,656

229928,Noninvasive wearable electroactive pharmaceutical monitoring for personalized therapeutics,2020,"BACKGROUND: Typical lung ultrasound (LUS) findings in patients with a COVID-19 infection were reported early on. During the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, LUS was propagated as a useful instrument in triage and monitoring. We evaluated LUS as a rapid diagnostic triage tool for the management of patients with suspected COVID-19 in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: The study retrospectively enrolled patients with suspected COVID-19, who were admitted from 1st April to 25th of April 2020 to the ED of a tertiary care center in Germany. During clinical work-up, patients underwent LUS and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2. The recorded ultrasound findings were analyzed and judged regarding typical signs of viral pneumonia, blinded for clinical information of the patients. The results were compared with PCR test and chest computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: 2236 patients were treated in the ED during the study period. 203 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using PCR, 135 (66.5%) underwent LUS and 39 (28.9%) of the patients were examined by chest CT scan. 39 (28.9%) of the 135 patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with PCR. In 52 (38.5%) COVID-19 was suspected from the finding of the LUS, resulting in a sensitivity of 76.9% and a specificity of 77.1% compared with PCR results. The negative predictive value reached 89.2%. The findings of the LUS had - compared to a positive chest CT scan for COVID-19 - a sensitivity of 70.6% and a specificity of 72.7%. CONCLUSIONS: LUS is a rapid and useful triage tool in the work-up of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection during a pandemic scenario. Still, the results of the LUS depend on the physician's experience and skills.","Schmid, Bonaventura; Feuerstein, Doreen; Lang, Corinna N; Fink, Katrin; Steger, Rebecca; Rieder, Marina; Duerschmied, Daniel; Busch, Hans-Jörg; Damjanovic, Domagoj",BMC Emerg Med,,656

METHODS: Ninety-nine infertile patients with cesarean section diverticulum received hysteroscopic treatment and were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were followed for 1 year. RESULTS: The study included ninety-nine symptomatic patients with cesarean section diverticulum. After surgery, the menstrual periods of patients were improved from 11.15 ± 4.44 to 7.69 ± 2.85 days. Forty-seven (47/99) women became pregnant after surgery. The number of patients who became pregnant with an anteflexion uterus after hysteroscopic surgery is 32 (32/57), and the number of women who became pregnant with a retroflexion uterus is 15 (15/42). CONCLUSION: Hysteroscopic surgery could improve the PCSD-associated prolonged menstrual bleeding, and satisfactory obstetrical outcomes could be achieved by the surgery treatment in women with cesarean defect.","Dou, Yingyu; Zeng, Da; Zou, Zi039; ang,; Wan, Yajun; Xu, Dabao; Xiao, Songshu",Arch. gynecol. obstet,,656

250430,Core Concept: Muography offers a new way to see inside a multitude of objects,2021,"In March 2020 schools in Austria temporarily closed and switched to distance learning to contain the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). The resulting situation posed great challenges to teachers, guardians and students (Huber and Helm 2020). Research has shown that perceived competence (Deci and Ryan 2000) affects selfregulated learning (SRL), intrinsic motivation and procrastination, however few studies have considered these variables in context of distance learning among adolescents. This study investigated differences in students who perceived themselves as high vs. low in competence with respect to these constructs. In an online questionnaire, 2652 Austrian secondary school students answered closed questions regarding SRL, intrinsic motivation and procrastination as well as open-ended questions about challenges, successes and need for support in distance. Structural equation modeling was applied for the quantitative analysis which was complemented by thematic analysis for the qualitative questions (Braun and Clarke 2006). Results showed that students who experienced themselves as highly competent use SRL strategies (goal setting and planning, time management, metacognitive strategies) more often and are more intrinsically motivated than students with lower perceived competence. They also procrastinate less. Furthermore, qualitative analysis revealed that although all students face similar challenges (e.g., independent learning, time and task management, learning on the computer, lack of contact with teachers and peers), students who perceived themselves as highly competent seemed to cope better, and have less need for support. Implications for distance learning and future research are discussed.

252656,"Correction for Nan et al., Anisotropic spin-orbit torque generation in epitaxial SrIrO3 by symmetry design",2020,"OBJECTIVE: Since the emergence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the death toll has been increasing daily. Many risk factors are associated with a high mortality rate in COVID-19. Establishment of a common pathway among these risk factors could improve our understanding of COVID-19 severity and mortality. This review aims at establishing this common pathway and its possible effect on COVID-19 mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current review was executed in five consecutive stages starting from determining the risk factors of COVID-19 mortality and trying to find a common pathway among them depending on the available literature. This was followed by proposing a mechanism explaining how this common pathway could increase the mortality. Finally, its potential role in managing COVID-19 was proposed. RESULTS: This review identified this common pathway to be a low baseline of reduced glutathione (i.e., GSH) level. In particular, this review provided an in-depth discussion regarding the pathophysiology by which COVID-19 leads to GSH depletion, tissue damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In addition, the current review demonstrated how GSH depletion could result in failure of the immune system and rendering the end organs vulnerable to damage from the oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: This preclinical study shows that GSH depletion may have a central role in COVID-19 mortality and pathophysiology. Therefore, elevating the GSH level in tissues may decrease the severity and mortality rates of COVID-19.","Khanfar, A; Al Qaroot, B",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,656

Most of the hospital setups worldwide have put telemedicine into practice ever since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed at assessing the effectiveness of Tele-otolaryngology (TO) at a tertiary care centre during the pandemic lockdown. A validated patient feedback questionnaire was developed and distributed to 2577 patients who utilised the TO mobile health service at our institute. Patient feedback-based assessment of TO effectiveness during COVID-19 lockdown was carried out. The validated questionnaire in English and Hindi was statistically robust with Cronbach's alpha value of 0.808 and 0.886 respectively. 1751 patients completed their feedback to the questionnaire. 97.5% utilised WhatsApp for TO consultation. 15.2% patients were detected of Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with TO guidance. Up to 75% patients had a positive response to the questionnaire and 91.1% opined of savings achieved either with travel time, cost incurred or the treatment time. With respect to patient health status, 71.5% recovered, 20.1% had no change and 8.4% deteriorated with a mortality rate of 1.65%. Telehealth in otolaryngology during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown was indispensable in managing exigencies.

The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between self-reported mental health concerns and subjective sleep quality of the Bangladeshi university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted to maintain the social distancing recommended by the World Health Organization. There were 1,317 student responses from 49 universities across Bangladesh. Data was analyzed by executing both bi-variate and multivariate analysis. Findings indicate that 27.1%, 51.0%, 45.9%, and 86.0% of students had poor subjective sleep quality, anxiety, depression, and fear of COVID-19, respectively. Anxiety (AOR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06 – 1.12, p &lt; 0.001) was a risk factor for increasing the poor subjective sleep quality of university students. In contrast, the odds of poor subjective sleep quality were lower with increasing the score of depression (AOR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.86 – 0.90, p &lt; 0.001) and fear of COVID-19 (AOR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94 – 0.99, p &lt; 0.05). Compared to public university students, private university students were more likely to report poor subjective sleep quality since the pandemic began. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that psychiatric conditions of university students should be monitored during the COVID-19 epidemic, and necessary strategies, such as allocation of resources, implementation of awareness programs, establishment of psychological counselling unit, should carefully be devised.","Ahammed, Benojir Jahan Nusrat Seddeque Aysha Hossain Md Tanvir Shovo Taufiq- E.

Concerns have been expressed regarding the underdiagnosing of harmful diseases. We explored the rates of emergency presentations for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and acute cerebrovascular events (ACVE) before and after spread of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We analyzed all-cause visits at a tertiary university emergency department and admissions for ACS and ACVE before (calendar weeks 1-9, 2020) and after (calendar weeks 10-16, 2020) the first coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case in the region of the Saarland, Germany. The data were compared with the same period of the previous year. RESULTS: In 2020 an average of 346 patients per week presented at the emergency department whereas in 2019 an average of 400 patients presented up to calendar week 16 (p = 0.018; whole year 2019 = 395 patients per week). After the first COVID-19 diagnosis in the region, emergency department visit volume decreased by 30% compared with the same period in 2019 (p = 0.0012). Admissions due to ACS decreased by 41% (p = 0.0023 for all; &#916; - 71% (p = 0.007) for unstable angina, &#916; - 25% (p = 0.42) for myocardial infarction with ST-elevation and &#916; - 17% (p = 0.28) without ST-elevation) compared with the same period in 2019 and decreased from 142 patients in calendar weeks 1-9 to 62 patients in calendar weeks 10-16. ACVE decreased numerically by 20% [p = 0.25 for all; transient ischemic attack: &#916; - 32% (p = 0.18), ischemic stroke: &#916; - 23% (p = 0.48), intracerebral haemorrhage: &#916; + 57% (p = 0.4)].

289517,America's electorate is increasingly polarized along partisan lines about voting by mail during the COVID-19 crisis,2020,"Methods designed to measure SARS-CoV-2 humoral response include virus neutralization tests to determine antibody neutralization activity. For ease of use and universal applicability, surrogate virus neutralization tests (sVNTs) based on antibody-mediated blockage of molecular interactions have been proposed. A surrogate virus neutralization test was established on a label-free immunoassay platform (LF-sVNT). The LF-sVNT analyzes the binding ability of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to ACE2 after neutralizing RBD with antibodies in serum. The LF-sVNT neutralizing antibody titers (IC50) were determined from serum samples (n=246) from COVID-19 patients (n=113), as well as the IgG concentrations and the IgG avidity indices. Although there was variability in the kinetics of the IgG concentrations and neutralizing antibody titers between individuals, there was an initial rise, plateau and then in some cases a gradual decline at later timepoints after 40 days post-symptom onset. The IgG avidity indices, in the same cases, plateaued after an initial rise and did not show a decline. The LF-sVNT can be a valuable tool in research and clinical laboratories for the assessment of the presence of neutralizing antibodies to COVID-19. This study is the first to provide longitudinal neutralizing antibody titers beyond 200 days post-symptom onset. Despite the decline of IgG concentration and neutralizing antibody titer, IgG avidity index increases, reaches a plateau and then remains constant up to 8 months post-infection. The decline of antibody neutralization activity can be attributed to the reduction in antibody quantity rather than the deterioration of antibody quality, as measured by antibody avidity.","Luo, Yiqi Ruben; Yun, Cassandra; Chakraborty, Indrani; Wu, Alan H B; Lynch, Kara L",J. clin. microbiol,,656

298323,Engineering cellular metabolite transport for biosynthesis of computationally predicted tropane alkaloid derivatives in yeast,2021,"BACKGROUND: Differential diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) during the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult, due to similarities in clinical and radiological presentation between COVID-19 and other ILDs on the one hand, and frequent false-negative swab results on the other. We describe a rare form of interstitial and organizing pneumonia resembling COVID-19, emphasizing some key aspects to focus on to get the right diagnosis and treat the patient properly. CASE PRESENTATION: A 76-year-old man presented with short breath and dry cough in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak. He showed bilateral crackles and interstitial-alveolar opacities on X-ray, corresponding on computed tomography (CT) to extensive consolidations with air bronchograms, surrounded by ground glass opacities (GGO). Although his throat-and-nasopharyngeal swab tested negative, the picture was overall compatible with COVID-19. On the other hand, he showed subacute, rather than hyperacute, clinical onset; few and stable parenchymal consolidations, rather than patchy and rapidly evolving GGO; pleural and pericardial thickening, pleural effusion, and lymph node enlargement, usually absent in COVID-19; and peripheral eosinophilia, rather than lymphopenia, suggestive of hypersensitivity. In the past year, he had been taking amiodarone for a history of ventricular ectopic beats. CT scans, in fact, highlighted hyperattenuation areas suggestive of amiodarone pulmonary accumulation and toxicity. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) investigation confirmed the absence of coronavirus genome in the lower respiratory tract; conversely, high numbers of foamy macrophages, eosinophils, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes with low CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio were detected, confirming the hypothesis of amiodarone-induced cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Timely discontinuation of amiodarone and initiation of steroid therapy led to resolution of respiratory symptoms, systemic inflammation, and radiographic opacities. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive analysis of medical and pharmacological history, clinical onset, radiologic details, and peripheral and BALF cellularity, is required for a correct differential diagnosis and management of ILDs in the COVID-19 era.","Zizzo, Gaetano; Caruso, Stefano; Ricchiuti, Elisabetta; Turato, Roberto; Stefani, Ilario; Mazzone, Antonino",Eur J Med Res,,656

The profile, clinical symptoms, laboratory outcomes, and radiologic assessments were extracted on 11 patients, who tested positive for COVID-19 with RT-PCR or serum antibody after discharged and was admitted to Hubei No. 3 People's Hospital of Jianghan University for a second treatment in March 2020. The average interval time between the first discharge and the second admission measured 16.00 ± 7.14 days, ranging from 6 to 27 days. In the second hospitalization, one patient was positive for RT-PCR and serum antibody immunoglobulin M (IgM)-immunoglobulin G (IgG), five patients were positive for both IgM and IgG but negative for RT-PCR. Three patients were positive for both RT-PCR and IgG but negative for IgM. The main symptoms were cough (54.55%), fever (27.27%), and feeble (27.27%) in the second hospitalization. Compared with the first hospitalization, there were significant decreases in gastrointestinal symptoms (5 vs 0, P = .035), elevated levels of both white blood cell count (P = .036) and lymphocyte count (P = .002), remarkedly decreases in C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A (P < .05) in the second hospitalization. Additionally, six patients' chest computed tomography (CT) exhibited notable improvements in acute exudative lesions.

DESIGN: This was a cross- sectional study. SETTING: Yue Yi Tong (YYT), a free online communication platform that allows pregnant women to consult professional obstetricians. PARTICIPANTS: All the pregnant women who used the YYT platform. INTERVENTION: From 10 to 23 February, we collected data on online obstetric consultations and participants' satisfaction through the YYT platform in the mild, moderate and severe epidemic areas which were defined according to the local confirmed cases. The primary outcomes were the reasons for online consultations by the severity of the epidemic. All the comparisons were performed using &#967;2 test. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS V.24. RESULTS: A total of 2599 pregnant women participated in this study, of whom 448 (17.24%), 1332 (51.25%) and 819 (31.51%) were from the mild, moderate and severe epidemic areas, respectively. The distribution of the amount of online consultations was significantly different not only in different areas (p<0.001) but also in different trimesters (p<0.001). A total of 957 participants completed the satisfaction part of the survey. In this study, 77.95% of the participants used e-health for the first time, and 94.63% of the participants were completely or mostly satisfied with the online consultations. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of the amount of online consultations was significantly different not only in different areas but also in different trimesters. In any trimester, the amount of consultations on the second category (obstetric care-seeking behaviour) was the highest in the severe epidemic areas. The needs for online consultations were substantial. In order to prevent irreversible obstetric adverse events, an appropriate antenatal care contingency plan with e-health services is highly recommended during the Public Health Emergency of International Concern.","Chen, Miaomiao; Liu, Xiyao; Zhang, Jun; Sun, Guoqiang; Gao, Ying; Shi, Yuan; Baker, Philip; Zeng, Jing; Zheng, Yangxi; Luo, Xin; Qi, Hongbo",BMJ Open,,656
320372,"Awareness-driven behavior changes can shift the shape of epidemics away from peaks and toward plateaus, shoulders, and oscillations",2020,"The proliferation of fake news on social media is now a matter of considerable public and governmental concern. In 2016, the UK EU referendum and the US Presidential election were both marked by social media misinformation campaigns, which have subsequently reduced trust in democratic processes. More recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the acceptance of fake news has been shown to pose a threat to public health. Research on how to combat the false acceptance of fake news is still in its infancy. However, recent studies have started to focus on the psychological factors which might make some individuals less likely to fall for fake news. Here, we adopt that approach to assess whether individuals who show high levels of 'emotional intelligence' (EQ) are less likely to fall for fake news items. That is, are individuals who are better able to disregard the emotionally charged content of such items, better equipped to assess the veracity of the information. Using a sample of UK participants, an established measure of EQ and a novel fake news detection task, we report a significant positive relationship between individual differences in emotional intelligence and fake news detection ability. We also report a similar effect for higher levels of educational attainment, and we report some exploratory qualitative fake news judgement data. Our findings are discussed in terms of their applicability to practical short term (i.e. current Facebook user data) and medium term (i.e. emotional intelligence training) interventions which could enhance fake news detection.","Preston, Stephanie; Anderson, Anthony; Robertson, David J; Shephard, Mark P; Huhe, Narisong",PLoS One,,656

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of scope exchange from a long single balloon enteroscope (SBE) to a gastroscope during SBE-assisted ERCP (SBE-ERCP) in patients with SAA. Methods: Patients who underwent SBE-ERCP between February 2019 and October 2020 were retrospectively identified. Intubation success, scope exchange success, cannulation success, and therapeutic success were analyzed along with complications. Results: Fifty-six patients with various SAAs underwent SBE-ERCP procedures, including Billroth II subtotal gastrectomy (B-II, n=13), pylorus-preserving pancreato-duodenectomy (PPPD, n=6), Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (REY HJ, n=4), and total gastrectomy with REY anastomosis (TG REY, n=33). Overall intubation, cannulation, and therapeutic success rates were 89.3%, 82.1%, and 82.1%, respectively. Therapeutic success rates did not differ significantly among the type of SAA. Successful scope exchange rate after successful intubation was significantly higher in native papilla (B-II and TG REY, 83.3%, 35/42) compared to bilioenteric anastomosis (PPPD and REY HJ, 0%, 0/8, p<0.001). Intubation success, scope exchange, and cannulation success were associated with therapeutic success (p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, successful scope exchange was the only factor related to cannulation success (p=0.02). The major complication rate was 1.8% (one perforation). Conclusions: SBE-ERCP is a safe and effective procedure to treat biliary problems in patients with SAA. Successful scope exchange may lead to higher therapeutic success by way of cannulation success.","Cho, Eunae; Park, Chang Hwan; Kim, Youngjung; Cho, Seo Yeon",Gut liver (Online),,656

In Palestine, there were 26,764 COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases as of 27th August 2020. In this paper, two statistical approaches, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and k-th moving averages - ARIMA models are used for modeling the COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases in Palestine. The data was taken from World Health Organization (WHO) website for one hundred seventy-six (176) days, from March 5, 2020 through August 27, 2020. We identified the best models for the above mentioned approaches that are ARIMA (1,2,4) and 5-th Exponential Weighted Moving Average - ARIMA (2,2,3). Consequently, we recommended to use the 5-th Exponential Weighted Moving Average - ARIMA (2,2,3) model in order to forecast new values of the daily cumulative confirmed cases in Palestine.

METHODS: In order to compare saliva and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, we designed a meta-analysis searching in PubMed up to December 29th, 2020 with the key words ""(SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID-19 OR COVID19) AND (salivary OR saliva OR oral fluid)) NOT (review[Publication Type]) NOT (PrePrint[Publication Type])"" applying the following criteria: records published in peer reviewed scientific journals, in English, with at least 15 nasopharyngeal/orapharyngeal swabs and saliva paired samples tested by RT-PCR, studies with available raw data including numbers of positive and negative tests with the two sampling methods. For all studies, concordance and sensitivity were calculated and then pooled in a random-effects model. FINDINGS: A total of 377 studies were retrieved, of which 50 were eligible, reporting on 16,473 pairs of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal and saliva samples. Meta-analysis showed high concordance, 92.5% (95%CI: 89.5-94.7), across studies and pooled sensitivities of 86.5% (95%CI: 83.4-89.1) and 92.0% (95%CI: 89.1-94.2) from saliva and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs respectively. Heterogeneity across studies was 72.0% for saliva and 85.0% for nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs.

360214,Mechanism for analogous illusory motion perception in flies and humans,2020,"The impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women and their neonates is an area of research interest nowadays. To date, there is limited knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, maternal and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women at term in middle- and low-income countries. In the present retro-prospective study, medical records of pregnant women admitted for delivery were reviewed from the largest Covid-19 dedicated Shri Maharaja Gulab Singh (SMGS) maternity hospital. The SARS-CoV-2 screening was carried out for all pregnant women admitted for delivery using RT-PCR. All neonates born from SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers were isolated and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most of the pregnant women (90.6%) were asymptomatic at the time of admission with a low prevalence (3.4%) of SARS-CoV-2. A higher rate of asymptomatic prevalence (86.1%) was found among SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women. On the basis of the RT-PCR result (negative vs. positive), statistically significant differences were found for maternal characteristics, such as mean gestational age (37.5 ± 2.2 vs. 36.6 ± 3.3), medical comorbidity (2.9% vs. 7.4%), and maternal outcomes like the C-section rate (29.8% vs. 58.3%), preterm delivery (14.6% vs. 28.3), and neonatal outcomes like mean birth weight (2840 ± 450 vs. 2600 ± 600), low Apgar score (2.7% vs. 6.48%), and fetal distress (10.9% vs. 22.2%) among SARS-CoV-2 negative and positive cases, respectively.

372335,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a cat owned by a COVID-19-affected patient in Spain,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 and dengue fever are difficult to distinguish given shared clinical and laboratory features. Failing to consider COVID-19 due to false-positive dengue serology can have serious implications. We aimed to assess this possible cross reactivity. METHODS: We analyzed clinical data and serum samples from 55 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. To assess dengue serology-status, we used dengue-specific antibodies by means of lateral-flow rapid test as well as enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay (ELISA). Additionally, we tested SARS-CoV-2 serology-status in patients with dengue and performed in-silico protein structural analysis to identify epitope similarities. RESULTS: Using the dengue lateral-flow rapid test we detected 12 positive cases out of the 55 (21.8%) COVID-19 patients versus zero positive cases in a control group of 70 healthy individuals (P= 2.5E-5). This includes nine cases of positive IgM, two cases of positive IgG and one case of positive IgM as well as IgG antibodies. ELISA testing for dengue was positive in two additional subjects using envelope-protein directed antibodies. Out of 95 samples obtained from patients diagnosed with dengue before September 2019, SARS-CoV-2 serology targeting the S protein was positive/equivocal in 21 (22%) (sixteen IgA, five IgG) versus four positives/equivocal in 102 controls (4%) (P= 1.6E-4). Subsequent in-silico analysis revealed possible similarities between SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in the HR2-domain of the spike-protein and the dengue envelope-protein. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support possible cross-reactivity between dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2, which can lead to false-positive dengue serology among COVID-19 patients and vice versa. This can have serious consequences for both patient care and public health.","Lustig, Yaniv; Keler, Shlomit; Kolodny, Rachel; Ben-Tal, Nir; Atias-Varon, Danit; Shlush, Ekaterina; Gerlic, Motti; Munitz, Ariel; Doolman, Ram; Asraf, Keren; Shlush, Liran I; Vivante, Asaf",Clin. infect. dis,,656

SARS-CoV-2 cannot infect mice due to incompatibility between its receptor binding domain and the murine ACE2 receptor. Through molecular modeling and empirical in vitro validation, we identified 5 key amino acid differences between murine and human ACE2 that mediate SARS-CoV-2 infection, generating a chimeric humanized murine ACE2. Additionally, we examined the ability of the humanized murine ACE2 receptor to permit infection by an additional preemergent group 2B coronavirus, WIV-1, providing evidence for the potential pan-virus capabilities of this chimeric receptor. Finally, we predicted the ability of these determinants to inform host range identification of preemergent coronaviruses by evaluating hot spot contacts between SARS-CoV-2 and additional potential host receptors. Our results identify residue determinants that mediate coronavirus receptor usage and host range for application in SARS-CoV-2 and emerging coronavirus animal model development.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19) is a major public health threat and one of two related coronaviruses that have caused epidemics in modern history. A method of screening potential infectible hosts for preemergent and future emergent coronaviruses would aid in mounting rapid response and intervention strategies during future emergence events. Here, we evaluated determinants of SARS-CoV-2 receptor interactions, identifying key changes that enable or prevent infection. The analysis detailed in this study will aid in the development of model systems to screen emergent coronaviruses as well as treatments to counteract infections.","Adams, Lily E; Dinnon, Kenneth H; Hou, Yixuan J; Sheahan, Timothy P; Heise, Mark T; Baric, Ralph S",mBio (Online),,656
372548,Vaccination as a social contract: The case of COVID-19 and US political partisanship,2021,"The emerging coronavirus pandemic is threatening the public health all over the world. Cytoskeleton is an intricate network involved in controlling cell shape, cargo transport, signal transduction, and cell division. Infection biology studies have illuminated essential roles for cytoskeleton in mediating the outcome of hostâvirus interactions. In this review, we discuss the dynamic interactions between actin filaments, microtubules, intermediate filaments, and coronaviruses. In one round of viral life cycle, coronaviruses surf along filopodia on the host membrane to the entry sites, utilize specific intermediate filament protein as co-receptor to enter target cells, hijack microtubules for transportation to replication and assembly sites, and promote actin filaments polymerization to provide forces for egress. During coronavirus infection, disruption of host cytoskeleton homeostasis and modification state is tightly connected to pathological processes, such as defective cytokinesis, demyelinating, cilia loss, and neuron necrosis. There are increasing mechanistic studies on cytoskeleton upon coronavirus infection, such as viral proteinâcytoskeleton interaction, changes in the expression and post-translation modification, related signaling pathways, and incorporation with other host factors. Collectively, these insights provide new concepts for fundamental virology and the control of coronavirus infection.","Wen, Zeyu; Zhang, Yue; Lin, Zhekai; Shi, Kun; Jiu, Yaming",J. mol. cell biol.

METHODS: We conducted a pilot prospective open, single-arm multicentre study on off-label use of tocilizumab (TCZ) involving 63 hospitalised adult patients (56 males, age 62.6±12.5) with severe COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory parameters were prospectively collected at baseline, day 1, 2, 7 and 14. No moderate-to-severe adverse events attributable to TCZ were recorded. RESULTS: We observed a significant improvement in the levels of ferritin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer. The ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pa02) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fi02) improved (mean±SD Pa02/Fi02 at admission: 152±53; at day 7: 283.73±115.9, at day 14: 302.2±126, p<0.05). The overall mortality was 11%; D-dimer level at baseline, but not IL-6 levels were predictors of mortality. TCZ administration within 6 days from admission in the hospital was associated with an increased likelihood of survival (HR 2.2 95%CI 1.3-6.7, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19, TCZ could be a safe option. An improvement in respiratory and laboratory parameters was observed.

However, noise and batch effect in sparse single-cell expression profiles can hamper correct estimation of dependencies among genes and regulatory changes. Here, we devise a conceptually different method using graphwavelet filters for improving gene network (GWNet)-based analysis of the transcriptome. Our approach improved the performance of several gene network-inference methods. Most Importantly, GWNet improved consistency in the prediction of gene regulatory network using single-cell transcriptome even in the presence of batch effect. The consistency of predicted gene network enabled reliable estimates of changes in the influence of genes not highlighted by differential-expression analysis. Applying GWNet on the single-cell transcriptome profile of lung cells, revealed biologically relevant changes in the influence of pathways and master regulators due to ageing. Surprisingly, the regulatory influence of ageing on pneumocytes type II cells showed noticeable similarity with patterns due to the effect of novel coronavirus infection in human lung.","Mishra, Shreya; Srivastava, Divyanshu; Kumar, Vibhor",Brief. bioinform,,656

We report a case of a 30-year-old male admitted to the hospital with a profuse vomiting and worsening fever, cough and shortness of breath, and was diagnosed with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. Seven days after admission, he became deteriorated with significant reduction of oxygen saturation and his coagulation parameter levels were increased with highly suspicion of pulmonary embolism. He was treated with azithromycin, isoprinosine, lopinavir, and fondaparinux with thromboprophylaxis dosage since admission. The role of increased fondaparinux dosage at the time of clinical deterioration was then followed by clinical improvement and reduced D-dimer level. Anticoagulant therapy, mainly with fondaparinux, showed a better prognosis in patients with markedly elevated D-Dimer. Fondaparinux needs to be monitored appropriately to prevent bleeding and adverse. The patient was discharged from the hospital in an improved condition and normal D-Dimer levels. There was no bleeding event nor other major side effects had been found in this case.

Many such assays have been launched by various manufacturers. Unfortunately, the new US Food and Drug Administration emergency use regulations have resulted in a situation where laboratories have to perform their own validation studies but many of these laboratories do not have the biobank needed to conduct the studies. METHODS: We introduce a method that allows institutions to quickly perform a verification study in a low-prevalence infection situation. As proof of concept, we used the Roche Elecsys® anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescence immunoassay and an SAP-based hospital information system. The Shenzhen YHLO Biotech IgM and IgG assay targeting other surface patterns was used as a confirmatory test. RESULTS: The Roche assay demonstrated a limit of detection of 0.069 cutoff index and successfully passed the performance validation according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute EP15-A3. The study population of 627 inpatients has a median age of 64 years, and approximately 13% of the group were under intensive care at the respective time point. All patients included tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (cobas® 6800, Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Only one false-positive result was obtained, resulting in a specificity for the Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 test of 99.84% and a negative predictive value of 99.98%. CONCLUSIONS: The anonymized use of residual material enables quick evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays, as shown in this work with the Roche Elecsys assay. Comparison of the control population with economic data makes it possible to validate the sampling set and therefore to determine diagnostic specificity. By use of the approach chosen, it was shown that the Roche test achieved very good results in terms of diagnostic specificity, reproducibility, and limit of detection.","Kittel, Maximilian; Findeisen, Peter; Muth, Maria-Christina; Thiaucourt, Margot; Gerhards, Catharina; Neumaier, Michael; Haselmann, Verena",Int J Infect Dis,,656
399127,"Correction for Zhang et al., Identifying airborne transmission as the dominant route for the spread of COVID-19",2020,"BACKGROUND: The very limited time allowed to face the COVID-19 pandemic poses a pressing challenge to find proper therapeutic approaches. However, synthesis and full investigation from preclinical studies to phase III trials of new medications is a time-consuming procedure, and not viable in a global emergency, such as the one we are facing. MAIN BODY: Drug repurposing/repositioning, a strategy effectively employed in cancer treatment, can represent a valid alternative. Most drugs considered for repurposing/repositioning in the therapy of the COVID-19 outbreak are commercially available and their dosage and toxicity in humans is well known, due to years (or even decades) of clinical use. This can allow their fast-track evaluation in phase II-III clinical trials, or even within straightforward compassionate use. Several drugs being re-considered for COVID-19 therapy are or have been used in cancer therapy. Indeed, virus-infected cells are pushed to enhance the synthesis of nucleic acids, protein and lipid synthesis and boost their energy metabolism, in order to comply to the ""viral program"". Indeed, the same features are seen in cancer cells, making it likely that drugs interfering with specific cancer cell pathways may be effective as well in defeating viral replication. SHORT CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, cancer drugs potentially suitable for facing SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been carefully reviewed. We present here a comprehensive analysis of available information on potential candidate cancer drugs that can be repurposed for the treatment of COIVD-19.","Ciliberto, Gennaro; Mancini, Rita; Paggi, Marco G",J Exp Clin Cancer Res,,656

406802,"Automated, multiparametric monitoring of respiratory biomarkers and vital signs in clinical and home settings for COVID-19 patients",2021,"BACKGROUND: Since the first cases reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide. In Indonesia, the first case was reported in early March 2020, and the numbers of confirmed infections have been increasing until now. Efforts to contain the virus globally and in Indonesia are ongoing. This is the very first manuscript using a spatial-temporal model to describe the SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Indonesia, as well as providing a patient profile for all confirmed COVID-19 cases. METHOD: Data was collected from the official website of the Indonesia National Task Force for the Acceleration of COVID-19, from the period of 02 March 2020-02 August 2020. The data from RT-PCR confirmed, SARS-CoV-2 positive patients was categorized according to demographics, symptoms and comorbidities based on case categorization (confirmed, recovered, dead). The data collected provides granular and thorough information on time and geographical location for all 34 Provinces across Indonesia. RESULTS: A cumulative total of 111,450 confirmed cases of were reported in Indonesia during the study period. Of those confirmed cases 67.79% (75,551/111,450) were shown as recovered and 4.83% (5,382/111,450) of them as died. Patients were mostly male (50.52%; 56,300/111,450) and adults aged 31 to 45 years old (29.73%; 33,132/111,450). Overall patient presentation symptoms of cough and fever, as well as chronic disease comorbidities were in line with previously published data from elsewhere in South-East Asia. The data reported here, shows that from the detection of the first confirmed case and within a short time period of 40 days, all the provinces of Indonesia were affected by COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to provide detailed characteristics of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients in Indonesia, including their demographic profile and COVID-19 presentation history. It used a spatial-temporal analysis to present the epidemic spread from the very beginning of the outbreak throughout all provinces in the country. The increase of new confirmed cases has been consistent during this time period for all provinces, with some demonstrating a sharp increase, in part due to the surge in national diagnostic capacity. This information delivers a ready resource that can be used for prediction modelling, and is utilized continuously by the current Indonesian Task Force in order to advise on potential implementation or removal of public distancing measures, and on potential availability of healthcare capacity in their efforts to ultimately manage the outbreak.","Aisyah, Dewi Nur; Mayadewi, Chyntia Aryanti; Diva, Haniena; Kozlakidis, Zisis; Adisasmito, Wiku",PLoS One,,656

421418,News Feature: Avoiding pitfalls in the pursuit of a COVID-19 vaccine,2020,"COVID-19 is characterized by excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute lung damage associated with patient mortality. While multiple inflammatory cytokines are produced by innate immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found that only the combination of TNF-&#945; and IFN-Î³ induced inflammatory cell death characterized by inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis. Mechanistically, TNF-&#945; and IFN-Î³ co-treatment activated the JAK/STAT1/IRF1 axis, inducing nitric oxide production and driving caspase-8/FADD-mediated PANoptosis. TNF-&#945; and IFN-Î³ caused a lethal cytokine shock in mice that mirrors the tissue damage and inflammation of COVID-19, and inhibiting PANoptosis protected mice from this pathology and death. Furthermore, treating with neutralizing antibodies against TNF-&#945; and IFN-Î³ protected mice from mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection, sepsis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and cytokine shock. Collectively, our findings suggest that blocking the cytokine-mediated inflammatory cell death signaling pathway identified here may benefit patients with COVID-19 or other infectious and autoinflammatory diseases by limiting tissue damage/inflammation.","Karki, Rajendra; Sharma, Bhesh Raj; Tuladhar, Shraddha; Williams, Evan Peter; Zalduondo, Lillian; Samir, Parimal; Zheng, Min; Sundaram, Balamurugan; Banoth, Balaji; Malireddi, R K Subbarao; Schreiner, Patrick; Neale, Geoffrey; Vogel, Peter; Webby, Richard; Jonsson, Colleen Beth; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi",Cell,,656

METHODS: This systematic review was based on a database search for articles of COVID-19 related acute pancreatitis in adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection that included age, gender, presenting symptoms, the onset of symptoms, laboratory values, imaging findings and exclusion of common causes of pancreatitis. RESULTS: Altogether 35 articles comprising 37 patients were included. Acute pancreatitis was the first presentation of COVID-19 in 43% of patients, concurrent with general or respiratory symptoms in 14% of patients or delayed after general or pulmonary symptoms by an average of 10 ± 5 d (range, 1 - 19 d) in 43% of patients. Serum amylase and lipase levels were elevated in 87% and 100% of patients. In 50% and 84%, amylase and lipase levels exceeded three-fold the upper normal limit. Pancreatic necrosis was reported in 6% of patients and in 12% of patients, the pancreas appeared normal. Three patients died. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the bi-modal pattern of the onset of symptoms supports both the cytotoxic and the immune-related pathogenesis of the pancreatic injury. Acute pancreatitis may be the first symptom of COVID-19 infection. Necrosis of the pancreas is rare.","Bircakova, Bianka; Bruha, Radan; Lambert, Lukas; Grusova, Gabriela; Michalek, Pavel; Burgetova, Andrea",Scand J Gastroenterol,,656

However, sensitivity of DESI-MSI for nonpolar lipids is restricted by low ionization efficiency and severe ion suppression. Here, a compact post-photoionization assembly combined with DESI (DESI/PI) was developed for simultaneous imaging polar and nonpolar lipids in tissue sections by switching off/on a portable krypton lamp. Compared with DESI, higher signal intensities of nonpolar compounds could be detected with DESI/PI. We describe the fabrication, optimization, implementation, and data transformation for imaging both the polar and nonpolar lipids in mouse brain tissue using an Agilent 6224 Accurate-Mass TOF mass spectrometer. More than ten nonpolar lipids including cholesterol and GalCer lipids were detected by DESI/PI in the positive ion mode, compared with that by DESI. In the negative-ion mode, ion yields of DESI/PI for lipids (HexCer, PE, and PE-P) were also increased by several folds.","Liu, Chengyuan; Qi, Fei; Pan, Yang",Methods Mol Biol,,656
436915,The human factor between airborne pollen concentrations and COVID-19 disease dynamics,2021,"BACKGROUND: Despite being associated with worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19, systematic determination of myocardial injury is not recommended. The aim of the study was to study the effect of myocardial injury assessment on risk stratification of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Seven hundred seven consecutive adult patients admitted to a large tertiary hospital with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Demographic data, comorbidities, laboratory results and clinical outcomes were recorded. Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was calculated in order to quantify the degree of comorbidities. Independent association of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) increase with outcomes was evaluated by multivariate regression analyses and area under curve. In addition, propensity-score matching was performed to assemble a cohort of patients with similar baseline characteristics. RESULTS: In the matched cohort (mean age 66.76 ± 15.7 years, 37.3% females), cTnI increase above the upper limit was present in 20.9% of the population and was associated with worse clinical outcomes, including all-cause mortality within 30 days (45.1% vs. 23.2%; p = 0.005). The addition of cTnI to a multivariate prediction model showed a significant improvement in the area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (0.775 vs. 0.756, DC-statistic = 0.019; 95% confidence interval 0.001-0.037). Use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors was not associated with mortality after adjusting by baseline risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial injury is independently associated with adverse outcomes irrespective of baseline comorbidities and its addition to multivariate regression models significantly improves their performance in predicting mortality. The determination of myocardial injury biomarkers on hospital admission and its combination with CCI can classify patients in three risk groups (high, intermediate and low) with a clearly distinct 30-day mortality.","Lorente-Ros, Alvaro; Monteagudo Ruiz, Juan Manuel; Rincón, Luis M; Ortega Pérez, Rodrigo; Rivas, Sonia; Martínez-Moya, Rafael; Sanromán, Maria Ascensión; Manzano, Luis; Alonso, Gonzalo Luis; Ibáñez, Borja; Zamorano, Jose Luis",Cardiol J,,656

Currently, there are limited effective medications approved for this deadly disease. Objective: To investigate the potential predictors of COVID-19 mortality and risk factors for hyperinflammation in COVID-19. Methods: Retrospective analysis was carried out in 1,149 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China, from 1/13/2020 to 3/15/2020. Results: We found significant differences in the rates of hyperuricemia (OR: 3.17, 95% CI: 2.13-4.70; p < 0.001) and hypoalbuminemia (OR: 5.68, 95% CI: 3.97-8.32; p < 0.001) between deceased and recovered patients. The percentages of hyperuricemia in deceased patients and recovered patients were 23.6% and 8.9%, respectively, which were higher than the reported age-standardized prevalence of 6.2% in Chinese population. Of note, the percentages of both IL-6 and uric acid levels in survived COVID-19 patients were above 90%, suggesting that they might be good specificity for indicators of mortality in COVID-19 patients. The serum level of uric acid (UA) was positively associated with ferritin, TNF-&#945;, and IL-6 but not with anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In addition, the levels of these proinflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients showed a trend of reduction after uric acid lowering therapy. Conclusions: Our results suggest that uric acid, the end product of purine metabolism, was increased in deceased patients with COVID-19. In addition, the serum level of uric acid was positively associated with inflammatory markers. Uric acid lowering therapy in COVID-19 patients with hyperuricemia may be beneficial.","Zheng, Ting; Liu, Xinxin; Wei, Yingying; Li, Xinlu; Zheng, Bing; Gong, Quan; Dong, Lingli; Zhong, Jixin",Mediators Inflamm,,656

CASE REPORT: During the quarantine period of the COVID-19 pandemic, a 70-year-old man presented with a 1-day history of a paracentral scotoma of the left eye (OS) associated with diaphoresis. Four days later, the patient developed fever (38° C) followed by cough. Oral and nasal swab PCR testing was positive for COVID-19. Visual acuity in the day of presentation was 20/20 in OD and 20/100 in OS. Multimodal retinal imaging was unremarkable in OD but cross-sectional OCT displayed focal hyperreflectivity at the level of the outer nuclear layer associated with disruption of the ellipsoid zone (EZ). The corresponding en face OCT revealed an inferonasal hyperreflective parafoveal lesion. At 1 month of follow-up, tracked OCT of the macula showed resolution of the hyperreflective signal, thinning of the outer nuclear layer, and near-complete recovery of EZ integrity. CONCLUSION: Patients with Covid-19 may rarely present with signs and symptoms of ocular disease.

This has been exacerbated with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of digital pathology and whole slide imaging (WSI) as an educational tool for distance teaching is underutilised and not fully exploited. This paper highlights the utility and feedback on the use of WSI for distance education/teaching. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Building on an existing relationship with the University of the West Indies (UWI), pathologists at University Health Network, Toronto, provided distance education using WSI, a digitised slide image hosting repository and videoconferencing facilities to provide case-based teaching to 15 UWI pathology trainees. Feedback was obtained from residents via a questionnaire and from teachers via a discussion. RESULTS: There was uniform support from teachers who felt that teaching was not hampered by the 'virtual' engagement. Comfort levels grew with each engagement and technical issues with sound diminished with the use of a portable speaker. The residents were very supportive and enthusiastic in embracing this mode of teaching. While technical glitches marred initial sessions, the process evened out especially when the slide hosting facility, teleconferencing and sound issues were changed. CONCLUSIONS: There was unanimous endorsement that use of WSI was the future, especially for distance teaching. However, it was not meant to supplant the use of glass slides in their current routine, daily practice.","Evans, Andrew John; Depeiza, Nadia; Allen, Shara-Gaye; Fraser, Kimone; Shirley, Suzanne; Chetty, Runjan",J. clin. pathol,,656

488723,Old vaccines for new infections: Exploiting innate immunity to control COVID-19 and prevent future pandemics,2021,"COVID-19 abatement strategies have risks and uncertainties which could lead to repeating waves of infection. We show-as proof of concept grounded on rigorous mathematical evidence-that periodic, high-frequency alternation of into, and out-of, lockdown effectively mitigates second-wave effects, while allowing continued, albeit reduced, economic activity. Periodicity confers (i) predictability, which is essential for economic sustainability, and (ii) robustness, since lockdown periods are not activated by uncertain measurements over short time scales. In turn-while not eliminating the virus-this fast switching policy is sustainable over time, and it mitigates the infection until a vaccine or treatment becomes available, while alleviating the social costs associated with long lockdowns.

494273,Lessons from Hurricane Katrina for predicting the indirect health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a global pandemic that has affected over 7 million people worldwide, resulting in over 400,000 deaths. In the past 20 years, they have been several viral epidemics that were primarily transmitted by respiratory droplets. The use of face masks is proven to be effective in protecting health-care workers as they perform their duties. Still, there is limited evidence about whether the widespread use of face mask would be very useful in protecting the general population. This study aimed to conduct a review to determine if face masks would be beneficial in the general population as a means of reducing the spread of COVID-19. The widespread implementation of wearing face masks by the general population is challenging due to a variety of factors. However, the extensive use of cloth masks in conjunction with other preventative measures such as social distancing and handwashing can potentially reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19.","Burnett, Mervin L; Sergi, Consolato M",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,656

The 14-day quarantine caused surgery of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) postponed. We aimed to explore the risk factors of RRD progression in a group of patients whose surgery was postponed during the top-level emergency response of COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective case series. Medical records of all consecutive patients with a diagnosis of RRD who underwent a surgical treatment at Beijing Tongren Hospital's retina service from February 16, 2020, to April 30, 2020 have been reviewed retrospectively. Medical history, symptoms, and clinical signs of progression of RRD were recorded. RRD progression was defined as the presence of either choroidal detachment or proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) progression during the quarantine period. Risk factors were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model, survival analysis, and logistic regression. RESULTS: Seventy-nine eyes of 79 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. The median time from the patients' presentation at the clinic to admission for surgery was 14 days (3-61 days). There were 70 cases (88.6%) who did not present to the hospital within 1 week of the onset of visual symptoms. There were 69 (87.3%) macular-off cases at the presentation and 27 (34.2%) cases combined with choroidal detachment. There were 49 (62.0%) cases with PVR B, 22 (27.8%) cases with PVR C, 4 (5.1%) cases with PVR D, and 4 (5.1%) cases with anterior PVR. After the 14-day quarantine, 21 (26.6%) cases showed RRD progression, and 9 cases showed RRD regression at the time of surgery. Neither the time of onset of the visual symptom (p = 0.46) nor the time between presentation and admission (p = 0.31) was significantly different between the patients with RRD progression and patients without RRD progression. The combination of choroidal detachment (3.07, 1.68-5.60, p<0.001) and retinal breaks located posterior to the equator (3.79, 1.21-11.80, p=0.02) were factors related to the progression of RRD. CONCLUSIONS: In our study during the COVID-19 outbreak, the RRD progression risk factors included a combination of choroidal detachment and retinal breaks posterior to the equator. Ophthalmologists should schedule the surgeries for RRD patients with these signs as soon as possible.","Zhao, Meng; Li, Jipeng; She, Haicheng; Liu, Ningpu",BMC Ophthalmol,,656
501011,Reply to Nepomuceno et al.: A renewed call for detailed social and demographic COVID-19 data from all countries,2020,"Over the past 20 years, dance has emerged as a safe, effective, and evidence-based community intervention that helps thousands of people living with Parkinson's disease around the globe maintain well-being and improve quality of life. From its initial emergence to the present, COVID-19 has posed fundamental challenges to people living with Parkinson's, forcing them to balance the need and desire to stay active and socially connected with the requirement to adhere to strict shelter-at-home orders. As cities and towns worldwide began shutting down in early 2020, people living with Parkinson's found themselves unable to access live dance activities that had provided consistent, reliable physical support; joyful cognitive stimulation; emotional connection; and social engagement. Government sanctioned closures and stay-at-home orders increased the potential for apathy, isolation, anxiety, and stress-factors that are already heightened in people with Parkinson's. COVID-19 also exacerbated disparities based on race, language, socioeconomic background, and age, inequities already present in the Parkinson's community and in Parkinson's-focused dance programming. In this article, the authors provide a description and analysis of ways one dance for Parkinson's program addressed multiples challenges through three key initiatives: online group classes in English and Spanish, telephone-based resources for people without internet access, and robust online training opportunities for teaching artists. The authors outline ways in which the pandemic has increased the inclusive nature of dance for Parkinson's programming and suggest that changes implemented during the pandemic will permanently alter program delivery for the better when it is safe to restore group classes in community settings.","Kelly, Maria Portman; Leventhal, David",Health Promot Pract,,656

510361,Explaining the homogeneous diffusion of COVID-19 nonpharmaceutical interventions across heterogeneous countries,2020,"Background: Skin bleaching was reported to be commonly practiced among women and Africa was reported to be one of the most affected yet the subject is not given much attention in public health research in Zimbabwe despite the adverse effects of skin bleaching on health. Method: This study was an exploratory cross-sectional survey to explore skin bleaching, skin bleaching patterns and factors associated with skin bleaching among women living in Zimbabwe. An online self-administered questionnaire was sent out to women on social network i.e. WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. Findings: A total number of 260 respondents, mean age 31.69 (SD, 8.12) years participated in the survey. The prevalence of skin bleaching among the participants was 31.15%. The major reason reported for skin bleaching was to have smooth and healthy skin alongside other factors such as beauty, gaining social favours for example getting married and good jobs. Occupation, complexion and marital status were associated with skin bleaching. The odds of skin bleaching for participants who were employed was 1.45(95% confidence interval [CI],0.32-1.91);p-value 0.02, dark skinned participants 2.56(95% CI, 0.76-2.87);p-value 0.01 and unmarried participants 2.87(95% CI,0.29-3.58);p-value 0.03. Conclusion: Evidence from the research suggests skin bleaching might be common among women living in Zimbabwe and possibly poses serious health threats to the women. Skin bleaching seems to be deep rooted in colourism. The colourism seems to be taken advantage of by the cosmetic industry which produce the potentially hazardous products which promise the revered light skin to women but which comes with a price. However, the study provides a base for future studies to explore more on skin bleaching practices among women living in Zimbabwe.","Nyoni-Kachambwa, Princess; Naravage, Wanapa; James, Nigel F; Van der Putten, Marc",Afr Health Sci,,656
512618,Overdispersion in COVID-19 increases the effectiveness of limiting nonrepetitive contacts for transmission control,2021,"ABSTRACT: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading worldwide, with its outlook not looking optimistic. Simultaneously, the epidemic is currently under control in many areas. The resumption of work and production in areas that have achieved control of outbreaks is a problem. Considering the extremely transmissible nature of COVID-19, and the presence of asymptomatic infected people, avoiding nosocomial infection and protecting medical staff and patients during the post-epidemic period remain difficult problems that need to be solved. At present, few articles have examined relevant experiences in the field of sports medicine. Wuhan, the People's Republic of China, was the original epicenter of COVID-19, with physicians as the initial frontline workers. Wuhan is now gradually returning to a more normal state after a series of urgent, strict, and effective measures were utilized to combat the epidemic. During this time, we collected first-hand experiences of sports medicine work resumption in the initial 2-month period, including preparations before resuming work, outpatient management methods, online outpatient services, inpatient ward management, principles for determination of the examination results, and preparations for operations. The strict and feasible management strategies that we conducted were useful in avoiding hospital-based infections. We intend to share our own experiences and thoughts in this area. We hope that this will be helpful and inspiring to our sports medicine colleagues around the world.","Jin, Shengyang; He, Yu; Yang, Kai; Gan, Qin; Huang, Wei; Wang, Xiaohong; Meng, Chunqing; Wang, Hong",J Bone Joint Surg Am,,656

In vitro, I-C inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture. RESEARCH QUESTION: Can a nasal spray with Iota-Carrageenan be useful in the prophylaxis of COVID-19 in health care workers managing patients with COVID-19 disease? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a pilot pragmatic multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing the use of a nasal spray containing I-C in the prophylaxis of COVID-19 in hospital personnel dedicated to care of COVID-19 patients. Clinically healthy physicians, nurses, kinesiologists and other health care providers managing patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive four daily doses of I-C spray or placebo for 21 days. The primary end point was clinical COVID-19, as confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing, over a period of 21 days. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04521322). RESULTS: A total of 394 individuals were randomly assigned to receive I-C or placebo. Both treatment groups had similar baseline characteristics.

In the context of specific immune response against the virus, a correlation between Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I (MHC-I) and the severity of the disease in patients with COVID-19 has been suggested. Aiming at better understanding the biology of the infection and the immune response against the virus in the Brazilian population, we analysed SARS-CoV-2 protein S peptides in order to identify epitopes able to elicit an immune response mediated by the most frequent MHC-I alleles using in silico methods. METHODS: Our analyses consisted in searching for the most frequent Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-A, HLA-B and HLA-C alleles in the Brazilian population, excluding the genetic isolates; then, we performed: molecular modelling for unsolved structures, MHC-I binding affinity and antigenicity prediction, peptide docking and molecular dynamics of the best fitted MHC-I/protein S complexes. RESULTS: We identified 24 immunogenic epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 protein S that could interact with 17 different MHC-I alleles (namely, HLA-A*01:01; HLA-A*02:01; HLA-A*11:01; HLA-A*24:02; HLA-A*68:01; HLA-A*23:01; HLA-A*26:01; HLA-A*30:02; HLA-A*31:01; HLA-B*07:02; HLA-B*51:01; HLA-B*35:01; HLA-B*44:02; HLA-B*35:03; HLA-C*05:01; HLA-C*07:01 and HLA-C*15:02) in the Brazilian population. CONCLUSIONS: Being aware of the intrinsic limitations of in silico analysis (mainly the differences between the real and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structure; and accuracy of the methods for simulate proteasome cleavage), we identified 24 epitopes able to interact with 17 MHC-I more frequent alleles in the Brazilian population that could be useful for the development of strategic methods for vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.","de Moura, Ronald Rodrigues; Agrelli, Almerinda; Santos-Silva, Carlos André; Silva, Natália; Assunção, Bruno Rodrigo; Brandão, Lucas; Benko-Iseppon, Ana Maria; Crovella, Sergio",J Clin Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32759312/; https://doi.org/10.1136/jclinpath-2020-206946,656

In particular, in the case of patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), concern about SARS-CoV-2 infection added to the burden of symptoms (BS) which already weights on the QoL of these patients. We designed a cross-sectional survey in order to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on status of anxiety, BS and QoL in MPN patients. METHODS: We analyzed the anxiety levels using the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS); BS modifications were studied using the 18 items of the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form [MPN-SAF]. RESULTS: 132 people answered to the survey: 27 (20.4%) patients achieved a moderate to marked anxiety index value: this group described a greater worsening of symptoms than the rest of the cohort (p <0.0001). Women showed a higher level of anxiety than men (p = 0.01). A trend for lower level of anxiety was reported by patients who performed habitual physical activity (p = 0.06). A total of 98 (74.2%) patients described worsening of their symptoms during the quarantine period; 94 (71.2%) patients had postponed appointments or visits: they showed a significant worsening of their BS (p =0.01). CONCLUSION: This study first showed that the COVID-19 quarantine had a significant negative impact on the level of anxiety and BS in MPN patients. We identified female gender, absence of physical activity, the need for frequent visit to the hospital and the absence of a direct access to healthcare staff as the main factors associated to a higher anxiety index and worst BS.","Cavalca, Fabrizio; Renso, Rossella; Zambrotta, Giovanni Paolo Maria; Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo; Elli, Elena Maria",Front Oncol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.668261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33937081/,656

The severity of influenza A virus (IAV) infection is also closely related to dysfunction of apoptosis regulation. In the virus infected cells, the functions of various host cellular molecules involved in regulation of induction of apoptosis are modulated by IAV proteins to enable effective virus replication. The modulation of the intracellular signaling pathway inducing apoptosis by the IAV infection also affects extracellular mechanisms controlling apoptosis, and triggers abnormal host responses related to the disease severity of IAV infections. This review focuses on apoptosis related molecules involved in IAV replication and pathogenicity, the strategy of the virus propagation through the regulation of apoptosis is also discussed.","Iwai, Atsushi; Shiozaki, Takuya; Miyazaki, Tadaaki",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X13017816; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.10.100; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X13017816; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24177013/,656
607234,Structural and functional analyses reveal promiscuous and species specific use of ephrin receptors by Cedar virus,2019-10-08,"In this information era, there is an urgent need for tighter integration of bioinformatics and experimental biology. The enormous amount of data generated by biological experiments calls for extensive computational analysis. Many bioinformatics textbooks at present mainly focus on theories, which hinders the vigorous development of scientific research. As a result, most students are simply familiar with the bioinformatics theories but lack the opportunity to put them into practice. Here, we present our bioinformatics docking project conducted during the self‐isolation period of the COVID‐19 pandemic. Five students used the RBD–ACE2 complex as a benchmark to conduct a systematic comparison of several open‐source online molecular docking programs. The virus surface spike protein mediates the entry of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus into human cells by binding to its receptor, angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), through its receptor‐binding domain (RBD). Through docking and comparing predicted structures to the crystal structure, students gained the opportunity to practice different bioinformatics tools independently and conduct research collaboratively. It opens a window for students to reach out to the state‐of‐the‐art bioinformatics techniques and to keep up with the research trends. The online workshop has also proven to be an innovative method for bioinformatics teaching. We hope our work can inspire other educators to develop strategies to expose undergraduate students to modern bioinformatics and turn every temporary difficulty into a possible learning opportunity.","Fan, Wenxuan; Mencius, Jun; Du, Wenjing; Fan, Huangyunxian; Zhu, Hongjin; Wei, Dongzhi; Zhou, Mian; Quan, Shu",Biochem Mol Biol Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369638/; https://doi.org/10.1002/bmb.21566,656

METHODS: We conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with PWUDs in 5 rural Oregon counties with high overdose rates. Participants were identified through participant-driven sampling along with flyer and text advertising (n = 36). Research staff conducted audio-recorded in-depth interviews via telephone, assessing COVID-19 effects on substance use, mental health, and overdose risk. Transcribed interviewers were coded for themes using a semantic approach. RESULTS: Participants reported various mental health symptoms and experiences due to COVID-19, including increased feelings of boredom, loneliness, and depression; increased worry and stress; and increased suicidal ideation. Participants described varying impacts of COVID-19 on substance use. Overall, participants who used only methamphetamine reported decreased use and people who used only heroin or heroin with methamphetamine reported increased use. Most participants reported that they were not concerned about overdose and that COVID-19 did not impact their concerns about overdose, despite increases in risky use and suicidal ideations. CONCLUSIONS: As rural communities respond to the evolving impacts of COVID-19, there is increasing need to identify strategies to address PWUD's mental, physical, and social health needs during COVID-19.","Stack, Erin; Leichtling, Gillian; Larsen, Jessica E.; Gray, Mary; Pope, Justine; Leahy, Judith M.; Gelberg, Lillian; Seaman, Andrew; Korthuis, Philip Todd",J Addict Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33156181/; https://doi.org/10.1097/adm.0000000000000770,656

This study aimed to detect risk factors for mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Our cohort were all consecutive adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at a secondary hospital in Madrid, March 3-16, 2020. Clinical and laboratory data came from electronic clinical records and were compared between survivors and non-survivors, with outcomes followed up until April 4. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods allowed us to explore risk factors associated with in-hospital death. FINDINGS: The cohort comprised 562 patients with COVID-19. Clinical records were available for evaluation for 392 patients attended at the emergency department of our hospital, of whom 199 were discharged, 85 remained hospitalized and 108 died during hospitalization. Among 311 of the hospitalized patients, 34.7% died. Of the 392 patients with records, the median age was 71.5 years (50.6-80.7); 52.6% were men. 252 (64.3%) patients had a comorbidity, hypertension being the most common: 175 (44.6%), followed by other cardiovascular disease: 102 (26.0%) and diabetes: 97 (24.7%). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with age over 65 (odds ratio 8.32, 95% CI 3.01-22.96; p<0.001), coronary heart disease (2.76, 1.44-5.30; 0.002), and both lower lymphocyte count (0.34, 0.17-0.68; 0.002) and higher LDH (1.25, 1.05-1.50; 0.012) per 1-unit increase and per 100 units respectively. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 was associated in our hospital at the peak of the pandemic with a crude mortality ratio of 19.2% and a mortality ratio of 34.7% in admitted patients, considerably above most of the ratios described in the Chinese series. These results leave open the question as to which factors, epidemiological or intrinsically viral, apart from age and comorbidities, can explain this difference in excess mortality.

628679,Correcting misperceptions of exponential coronavirus growth increases support for social distancing,2020-07-14,"Senolytics are a class of drugs that selectively clear senescent cells (SC). The first senolytic drugs Dasatinib, Quercetin, Fisetin and Navitoclax were discovered using a hypothesis‐driven approach. SC accumulate with ageing and at causal sites of multiple chronic disorders, including diseases accounting for the bulk of morbidity, mortality and health expenditures. The most deleterious SC are resistant to apoptosis and have up‐regulation of anti‐apoptotic pathways which defend SC against their own inflammatory senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP), allowing them to survive, despite killing neighbouring cells. Senolytics transiently disable these SCAPs, causing apoptosis of those SC with a tissue‐destructive SASP. Because SC take weeks to reaccumulate, senolytics can be administered intermittently – a ‘hit‐and‐run’ approach. In preclinical models, senolytics delay, prevent or alleviate frailty, cancers and cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, liver, kidney, musculoskeletal, lung, eye, haematological, metabolic and skin disorders as well as complications of organ transplantation, radiation and cancer treatment. As anticipated for agents targeting the fundamental ageing mechanisms that are ‘root cause’ contributors to multiple disorders, potential uses of senolytics are protean, potentially alleviating over 40 conditions in preclinical studies, opening a new route for treating age‐related dysfunction and diseases. Early pilot trials of senolytics suggest they decrease senescent cells, reduce inflammation and alleviate frailty in humans. Clinical trials for diabetes, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Alzheimer’s disease, COVID‐19, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, eye diseases and bone marrow transplant and childhood cancer survivors are underway or beginning. Until such studies are done, it is too early for senolytics to be used outside of clinical trials.","Kirkland, J.

631832,Dangerous to claim “no clear association” between intergenerational relationships and COVID-19,2020-10-20,"Possessing expert schemas is a positive feat that may yield different types of adaptive outcomes (e.g., informing procedural understanding that may result in a student skipping a few of the solution steps involved). Limited schemas, in contrast, may deter progress of a novice learner, limiting his/her capability to flourish. Taken as a whole, it may be concluded that expert schemas are more advantageous than novice schemas, differentiating learners in terms of expert and novice. Having said this, however, more recently, researchers have argued that possessing expert schemas could serve as deterrence. Recently, researchers have acknowledged a theoretical concept known as cognitive entrenchment, which is defined as a high level of stability in domain schemas. This description interestingly suggests that “entrenchment” or “situated fixation” of a course of action (e.g., a subject matter) could hinder the progress and learning experience of a person, namely—his/her inability and/or unwillingness to adapt to a new context, and/or his/her inflexibility and insistence to stay on course without any intent to change. One example of cognitive entrenchment is observed in professional football, wherein it has been argued that some football coaches are cognitively entrenched within their expert schemas, resulting in their demised game plans and strategic acumen. We advance the study of cognitive entrenchment by proposing an alternative viewpoint, which we term as the “perceived zone of certainty and uncertainty.” This proposition counters the perspective of cognitive entrenchment by arguing that it is cognitive appraisal, judgment, mental resolute, and determination of a person in cognitive certainty of his/her success or failure, or the cognitive uncertainty of success or failure, that would explain the notion of inflexibility and/or unwillingness to adapt, and/or insistence to stay on course without any attempt to deviate. Moreover, we rationalize that certainty of success or failure would closely associate with a feeling of comfort, whereas uncertainty would associate with his/her feeling discomfort. In this analysis, we strongly believe that willingness to change and adapt, reluctance and insistence to remain on course, and/or inclination to embrace flexibility may not necessarily relate to the concept of cognitive entrenchment; rather, inflexibility and/or reluctance to change for the purpose of adaptation has more to do with the desire of a person to seek a state of comfort. Finally, our conceptual analysis of cognitive entrenchment also considers an interesting theoretical concept, which we termed as “perceived optimal efficiency.” Perceived optimal efficiency, similar to cognitive relevance theory, is concerned with the relationship between minimum investment of time, effort, cognitive resources, etc., and an optimal best outcome. The issue for discussion, from our point of view, is related to the extent to which the certainty of success or failure would associate with perceived optimal efficiency.","Phan, Huy P.; Ngu, Bing H.",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34566751/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.666274,656

Although there is a significant correlation between blood biomarkers and CT radiological findings, a potential correlation between biochemical parameters and LUS images is still unknown. Our purpose was to evaluate a potential association between lung lesions visualised by LUS and blood biomarkers as well as the ability to predict mortality from two different lung ultrasound scoring systems (LUSS). We performed a retrospective observational study on 45 patients aged >70 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection who required hospitalisation. LUS was carried out at admission and on day 7, when the clinical course was favourable or earlier in case of worsening. Disease severity was scored by means of LUSS in 8 (LUSS8) and in 12 (LUSS12) quadrants. LUS and blood draw for inflammatory marker analysis were performed at the same time. The correlation between biochemical parameters and either LUSS score was significant for ferritin levels. It was 0.486 (p=0.001) for LUSS8 and 0.458 (p=0.002) for LUSS12. Using a threshold score of 15 with LUSS12 predicted mortality in 86.7% of cases (ORcrude 31, CI 95% 4.79-200.51). Applying a threshold of 10 with LUSS8 predicted mortality in 88.9% (ORcrude 69.75, CI 95% 6.90-705.20). There is a correlation between ferritin levels and LUSS.

This work analyses the literature about (critical) raw materials and COVID-19, not only to present the impact of the pandemic on their supply, but also to propose some actions that should be pursued in a post-pandemic renaissance scenario, to increase raw materials availability, with great attention to most critical ones, in the frame of circular economy principles. The post-pandemic possibilities are evaluated and suitable actions are suggested to secure the raw materials availability for the foreseen increase of investments in crucial and strategic sectors, in accord with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The proposed actions can be summarized as policy, strategy, economy, and technology activities.","Zanoletti, Alessandra; Cornelio, Antonella; Bontempi, Elza",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34273363/,656
655794,"Reply to Marot et al.: The struggle to comply with social-distancing is multifaceted, as are the ways of mitigating it",2021,"Bacterial biopolymers are naturally occurring materials comprising a wide range of molecules with diverse chemical structures that can be produced from renewable sources following the principles of the circular economy. Over the last decades, they have gained substantial interest in the biomedical field as drug nanocarriers, implantable material coatings, and tissue-regeneration scaffolds or membranes due to their inherent biocompatibility, biodegradability into nonhazardous disintegration products, and their mechanical properties, which are similar to those of human tissues. The present review focuses upon three technologically advanced bacterial biopolymers, namely, bacterial cellulose (BC), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), and γ-polyglutamic acid (PGA), as models of different carbon-backbone structures (polysaccharides, polyesters, and polyamides) produced by bacteria that are suitable for biomedical applications in nanoscale systems. This selection models evidence of the wide versatility of microorganisms to generate biopolymers by diverse metabolic strategies. We highlight the suitability for applied sustainable bioprocesses for the production of BC, PHA, and PGA based on renewable carbon sources and the singularity of each process driven by bacterial machinery. The inherent properties of each polymer can be fine-tuned by means of chemical and biotechnological approaches, such as metabolic engineering and peptide functionalization, to further expand their structural diversity and their applicability as nanomaterials in biomedicine.","Blanco, Francisco G.; Hernández, Natalia; Rivero-Buceta, Virginia; Maestro, Beatriz; Sanz, Jesús M.; Mato, Aránzazu; Hernández-Arriaga, Ana M.; Prieto, M.

We evaluated multiple extraction and PCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. We included 65 positive samples which were run on the Panther Fusion using a laboratory developed test (LDT, E gene target). Where viral RNA was extracted by MagNA Pure (MP) 96 extraction platform or EpMotion 5075/Geneaid extraction kit, SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed on Light Cycler (LC) 480 using a LDT (E gene) or 3 commercial assays; Certest Viasure (Orf1ab, N genes) GenePro (E, RdRp genes) and A* Star Fortitude (proprietary target). Median Cts on LC 480 LDT for specimens (n = 9) extracted on MP 96 (26.6) were lower than on EpMotion (31.6) whereas median Cts for specimens (n = 10) extracted on the Panther Fusion LDT (23.1) were comparable with MP 96 /LC480 LDT (23.6). Specimens tested on Panther Fusion LDT (n = 28), extracted by MP 96, and amplified using commercial assays showed good concordance with a few exceptions; lower median Ct values were seen for 2 targets on GenePro (16.9, 21.5) and Viasure (19.5, 21.1) than for the Panther Fusion LDT (24.2) and A* Star Fortitude (25.6). Specimens tested on MP 96 (n = 18) had comparable results using commercial assays, with lower median Cts for Viasure (22.2, 23.7) compared with the LC 480 LDT (24.7), GenePro (24.7,25.7) and A*Fortitude (25.1) assays.

Today, the world is facing a pandemic with a novel coronavirus, which is related to the higher rates of mental problems reported worldwide. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of the Covid-19 related experiences, educational experiences, and family functioning on mental health and wellbeing among children and adolescents in Chile during the Pandemic and lockdown health measures. Methods: This is a cross-sectional analysis of the first wave of an ongoing longitudinal study among girls and boys of Pre-Kindergarten to 12th grade (4–18 years old) in Santiago, Chile. The sample consisted of 979 students from eight different schools. The method of data collection was online surveys administered to parents and adolescents. The dependent variables were mental health problems and wellbeing. Several independent variables were assessed (sociodemographic variables, Covid-19 related experiences, related educational experiences, and family functioning). A descriptive analysis and univariable and multivariable regression models were performed to study the association between variables. Results: Positive educational experiences, primarily academic self-concept, reduced the probability of mental health problems and increased wellbeing. Among covid-19 related variables, practicing meditation or praying reduced emotional problems, while having family or health problems increased emotional problems among adolescents. No clear association between Covid-19 related experiences variables among children was found. Conclusions: Our findings may help educational and public health authorities to plan future school preventive interventions to improve mental health and wellbeing in this population.","Ramirez, Saray; Aldunate, María Paz; Arriagada, Carolina; Bueno, Massiel; Cuevas, Florencia; González, Xaviera; Araya, Ricardo; Gaete, Jorge",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33995147/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.647456,656
671295,Reducing mask resistance among White evangelical Christians with value-consistent messages,2021-05-25,"The mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 causes severe multi-organ failure is largely unknown. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the frequent organ damage in severe COVID-19 patients. Previous studies have shown that human renal tubule cells could be the potential host cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Traditional cancer cell lines or immortalized cell lines are genetically and phenotypically different from host cells. Animal models are widely used, but often fail to reflect a physiological and pathogenic status because of species tropisms. There is an unmet need for normal human epithelial cells for disease modeling. In this study, we successfully established long term cultures of normal human kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells (KPTECs) in 2D and 3D culture systems using conditional reprogramming (CR) and organoids techniques. These cells had the ability to differentiate and repair DNA damage, and showed no transforming property. Importantly, the CR KPTECs maintained lineage function with expression of specific transporters (SLC34A3 and cubilin). They also expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, cancer cell line did not express endogenous SLC34A3, cubilin and ACE2. Very interestingly, ACE2 expression was around twofold higher in 3D organoids culture compared to that in 2D CR culture condition. Pseudovirion assays demonstrated that SARS-CoV spike (S) protein was able to enter CR cells with luciferase reporter. This integrated 2D CR and 3D organoid cultures provide a physiological ex vivo model to study kidney functions, innate immune response of kidney cells to viruses, and a novel platform for drug discovery and safety evaluation.

671425,"Awareness-driven behavior changes can shift the shape of epidemics away from peaks and toward plateaus, shoulders, and oscillations",2020-12-22,"This study examines modal verbs in German press coverage of COVID-19 during the first phase of the pandemic. The data basis is an 18-million-word corpus of newspaper articles. For analysis, a sample is drawn from the total number of modal verbs in the corpus and these are categorised according to their discourse function. The corresponding annotated data are analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. For this purpose, the study draws back to Kratzer’s concept of conversational backgrounds. It turns out that in addition to normative speech backgrounds, goal formulations can be found above all. Normative backgrounds are evoked, on the one hand, to address official rules and their effects and, on the other hand in appeals and demands, to refer to social norms that are assumed as common ground. The fact that teleological backgrounds play a relatively large role indicates that the normalisation perspective is of great importance as a regulative in the crisis discourse. More positive than negative determining factors are indicated and uncertainty markings occur comparatively rarely. This points to successful crisis communication in this discourse phase.","Müller, Marcus",Z Literaturwiss Linguistik,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41244-021-00212-4,656

In experiment 1, 48 Holstein calves were fed 4L of pooled maternal colostrum or 4L of reconstituted colostrum supplement with 0, 200, or 400g of added whey protein concentrate or casein. In experiment 2, 38 Jersey calves were fed 2L of pooled maternal colostrum with 100 or 200g of whey protein concentrate or casein added immediately before feeding. Blood was collected at 24h of age and plasma IgG concentration, total protein, hematocrit (experiment 1 only), and plasma urea N were determined. In experiment 1, blood samples were also collected at 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20h to evaluate absorption of IgG and protein and urea N concentrations. The addition of 400g of casein to colostrum supplement in experiment 1 reduced plasma IgG from 5.66g/L (0g of casein addition) to 3.88g/L, increased plasma urea N at 24h, and reduced the change in plasma total protein from 0 to 24h. Hourly plasma IgG concentrations increased with the consumption of colostrum or supplements but increased more rapidly in calves fed whey protein concentrate and more slowly in calves fed casein. The addition of 200g of casein or whey protein concentrate to colostrum supplements had no effect on plasma IgG concentration at 24h of age. The addition of 100 or 200g of casein or whey protein concentrate to maternal colostrum had no effect on plasma urea N, total protein, or plasma IgG in experiment 2. The addition of nonimmunoglobulin protein to colostrum supplements or maternal colostrum did not affect IgG absorption from the intestine of newborn calves unless the amount of total protein exceeded 500g of protein.","Davenport, D.

676255,Incentives can spur COVID-19 vaccination uptake,2021-09-07,"Hypothesis Drying-induced decrease in lip balm surface energy enhances virus adhesion due to the emergence of strong hydrophobic colloid-surface interactions. Experiments A protocol was developed for preparing lip balm coatings to enable physicochemical characterization and adhesion studies. Surface charge and hydrophobicity of four brands of lip balm (dry and hydrated) and human adenovirus 5 (HAdV5) were measured and used to calculate the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) energy of interactions between lip balm coatings and HAdV5 as well as four other colloids: HAdV40, MS2 and P22 bacteriophages, and SiO(2). Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) tests employed SiO(2) colloids, HAdV5 and hydrated lip balms. Findings Drying of lip balms results in a dramatic decrease of surface energy ([Formula: see text] 83.0 mJ/m(2)) making the surfaces highly hydrophobic. For dry lip balms, the interaction with all five colloids is attractive. For lip balms hydrated in 150 mM NaCl (ionic strength of human saliva), XDLVO calculations predict that hydrophilic colloids (MS2, P22, SiO(2)) may attach into shallow secondary minima. Due to the relative hydrophobicity of human adenoviruses, primary maxima in XDLVO profiles are low or non-existent making irreversible deposition into primary energy minima possible. Preliminary QCM-D tests with SiO(2) colloids and HAdV5 confirm deposition on a hydrated lip balm.","Wang, Xunhao; Şengür-Taşdemir, Reyhan; Koyuncu, İsmail; Tarabara, Volodymyr V.",J Colloid Interface Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002197972031033X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002197972031033X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.07.143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32877879/,656

All the synthesized compounds were characterized by FT-IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. Anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic potential of all the synthesized compounds (3a-k) was evaluated by MTT and Hoechst 33258 staining assay respectively whereas their antioxidant properties were determined via DPPH free radical scavenging assay. The most active compounds (3a, 3c and 3k) showed significant cytotoxic potential against HeLa cells with an inhibition of cell viability that ranged between 28.54 and 44.67% (P < 0.001). Albeit statistically different, the anti-proliferative effect of 3c was in close match with that of the reference drug doxorubicin. Likewise, the test compounds showed profound pro-apoptotic potential with an apoptotic index that ranged between 52.86 and 75.61%. Besides, the docking studies revealed a higher efficiency for compounds (3a and 3h) owing to their better affinity and inhibition constant (K(i) = 4.397 and 3.713 nmol) respectively.

688734,Timing social distancing to avert unmanageable COVID-19 hospital surges,2020-08-18,"BACKGROUND: Acute retroviral syndrome (ARS) is associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype and disease progression, but the underlying immunopathological pathways are poorly understood. We aimed to elucidate associations between innate immune responses during hyperacute HIV-1 infection (hAHI) and ARS. METHODS: Plasma samples obtained from volunteers (≥18.0 years) before and during hAHI, defined as HIV-1 antibody negative and RNA or p24 antigen positive, from Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, and Sweden were analyzed. Forty soluble innate immune markers were measured using multiplexed assays. Immune responses were differentiated into volunteers with stronger and comparatively weaker responses using principal component analysis. Presence or absence of ARS was defined based on 11 symptoms using latent class analysis. Logistic regression was used to determine associations between immune responses and ARS. RESULTS: Of 55 volunteers, 31 (56%) had ARS. Volunteers with stronger immune responses (n = 36 [65%]) had increased odds of ARS which was independent of HIV-1 subtype, age, and risk group (adjusted odds ratio, 7.1 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.7–28.8], P = .003). Interferon gamma-induced protein (IP)-10 was 14-fold higher during hAHI, elevated in 7 of the 11 symptoms and independently associated with ARS. IP-10 threshold >466.0 pg/mL differentiated stronger immune responses with a sensitivity of 84.2% (95% CI: 60.4–96.6) and specificity of 100.0% (95% CI]: 90.3–100.0). CONCLUSIONS: A stronger innate immune response during hAHI was associated with ARS. Plasma IP-10 may be a candidate biomarker of stronger innate immunity. Our findings provide further insights on innate immune responses in regulating ARS and may inform the design of vaccine candidates harnessing innate immunity.","Hassan, Amin S; Hare, Jonathan; Gounder, Kamini; Nazziwa, Jamirah; Karlson, Sara; Olsson, Linnéa; Streatfield, Claire; Kamali, Anatoli; Karita, Etienne; Kilembe, William; Price, Matt A; Borrow, Persephone; Björkman, Per; Kaleebu, Pontiano; Allen, Susan; Hunter, Eric; Ndung’u, Thumbi; Gilmour, Jill; Rowland-Jones, Sarah; Esbjörnsson, Joakim; Sanders, Eduard J",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33588436/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab139,656
