22,22,22,Detection and characterization of horizontal transfers in prokaryotes using genomic signature,9.034368,5.8126655,2005-01-13,"Horizontal DNA transfer is an important factor of evolution and participates in biological diversity. Unfortunately, the location and length of horizontal transfers (HTs) are known for very few species. The usage of short oligonucleotides in a sequence (the so-called genomic signature) has been shown to be species-specific even in DNA fragments as short as 1 kb. The genomic signature is therefore proposed as a tool to detect HTs. Since DNA transfers originate from species with a signature different from those of the recipient species, the analysis of local variations of signature along recipient genome may allow for detecting exogenous DNA. The strategy consists in (i) scanning the genome with a sliding window, and calculating the corresponding local signature (ii) evaluating its deviation from the signature of the whole genome and (iii) looking for similar signatures in a database of genomic signatures. A total of 22 prokaryote genomes are analyzed in this way. It has been observed that atypical regions make up ∼6% of each genome on the average. Most of the claimed HTs as well as new ones are detected. The origin of putative DNA transfers is looked for among ∼12 000 species. Donor species are proposed and sometimes strongly suggested, considering similarity of signatures. Among the species studied, Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus Influenzae and Escherichia coli are investigated by many authors and give the opportunity to perform a thorough comparison of most of the bioinformatics methods used to detect HTs.","Dufraigne, Christine; Fertil, Bernard; Lespinats, Sylvain; Giron, Alain; Deschavanne, Patrick",Nucleic Acids Res,22,1
70,70,70,Antisense-induced ribosomal frameshifting,9.130576,5.9058056,2006-08-18,"Programmed ribosomal frameshifting provides a mechanism to decode information located in two overlapping reading frames by diverting a proportion of translating ribosomes into a second open reading frame (ORF). The result is the production of two proteins: the product of standard translation from ORF1 and an ORF1–ORF2 fusion protein. Such programmed frameshifting is commonly utilized as a gene expression mechanism in viruses that infect eukaryotic cells and in a subset of cellular genes. RNA secondary structures, consisting of pseudoknots or stem–loops, located downstream of the shift site often act as cis-stimulators of frameshifting. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that antisense oligonucleotides can functionally mimic these RNA structures to induce +1 ribosomal frameshifting when annealed downstream of the frameshift site, UCC UGA. Antisense-induced shifting of the ribosome into the +1 reading frame is highly efficient in both rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation reactions and in cultured mammalian cells. The efficiency of antisense-induced frameshifting at this site is responsive to the sequence context 5′ of the shift site and to polyamine levels.","Henderson, Clark M.; Anderson, Christine B.; Howard, Michael T.",Nucleic Acids Res,22,1
72,72,72,Role of RNA helicases in HIV-1 replication,9.210989,5.912634,2006-08-25,"Viruses are replication competent genomes which are relatively gene-poor. Even the largest viruses (i.e. Herpesviruses) encode only slightly >200 open reading frames (ORFs). However, because viruses replicate obligatorily inside cells, and considering that evolution may be driven by a principle of economy of scale, it is reasonable to surmise that many viruses have evolved the ability to co-opt cell-encoded proteins to provide needed surrogate functions. An in silico survey of viral sequence databases reveals that most positive-strand and double-stranded RNA viruses have ORFs for RNA helicases. On the other hand, the genomes of retroviruses are devoid of virally-encoded helicase. Here, we review in brief the notion that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) has adopted the ability to use one or more cellular RNA helicases for its replicative life cycle.","Jeang, Kuan-Teh; Yedavalli, Venkat",Nucleic Acids Res,22,1

In human [Formula: see text] three modified bases are present in the anticodon stem–loop—2-methylthio-N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine at position 37 (ms(2)t(6)A37), 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine at position 34 (mcm(5)s(2)U34) and pseudouridine (ψ) at position 39—two of which, ms(2)t(6)A37 and mcm(5)s(2)U34, are required to achieve wild-type binding activity of wild-type human [Formula: see text] [C. Yarian, M. Marszalek, E. Sochacka, A. Malkiewicz, R. Guenther, A. Miskiewicz and P. F. Agris (2000) Biochemistry, 39, 13390–13395]. Molecular dynamics simulations of nine tRNA anticodon stem–loops with different combinations of nonstandard bases were performed. The wild-type simulation exhibited a canonical anticodon stair-stepped conformation. The ms(2)t(6) modification at position 37 is required for maintenance of this structure and reduces solvent accessibility of U36. Ms(2)t(6)A37 generally hydrogen bonds across the loop and may prevent U36 from rotating into solution.

Here we describe s-RT-MELT, a novel technology that enables highly expanded enzymatic mutation scanning in human samples for germline or low-level somatic mutations, or for SNP discovery. GC-clamp-containing PCR products from interrogated and wild-type samples are hybridized to generate mismatches at the positions of mutations over one or multiple sequences in-parallel. Mismatches are converted to double-strand breaks using a DNA endonuclease (Surveyor™) and oligonucleotide tails are enzymatically attached at the position of mutations. A novel application of PCR enables selective amplification of mutation-containing DNA fragments. Subsequently, melting curve analysis, on conventional or nano-technology real-time PCR platforms, detects the samples that contain mutations in a high-throughput and closed-tube manner. We apply s-RT-MELT in the screening of p53 and EGFR mutations in cell lines and clinical samples and demonstrate its advantages for rapid, multiplexed mutation scanning in cancer and for genetic variation screening in biology and medicine.","Li, Jin; Berbeco, Ross; Distel, Robert J.; Jänne, Pasi A.; Wang, Lilin; Makrigiorgos, G.

104,104,104,FluGenome: a web tool for genotyping influenza A virus,9.123541,6.1357493,2007-05-30,"Influenza A viruses are hosted by numerous avian and mammalian species, which have shaped their evolution into distinct lineages worldwide. The viral genome consists of eight RNA segments that are frequently exchanged between different viruses via a process known as genetic reassortment. A complete genotype nomenclature is essential to describe gene segment reassortment. Specialized bioinformatic tools to analyze reassortment are not available, which hampers progress in understanding its role in host range, virulence and transmissibility of influenza viruses. To meet this need, we have developed a nomenclature to name influenza A genotypes and implemented a web server, FluGenome (http://www.flugenome.org/), for the assignment of lineages and genotypes. FluGenome provides functions for the user to interrogate the database in different modalities and get detailed reports on lineages and genotypes. These features make FluGenome unique in its ability to automatically detect genotype differences attributable to reassortment events in influenza A virus evolution.","Lu, Guoqing; Rowley, Thaine; Garten, Rebecca; Donis, Ruben O.",Nucleic Acids Res,22,28

Pol β expression has been previously shown to be regulated at the level of transcription, but there is also evidence of post-transcriptional regulation, since rat transcripts undergo alternative polyadenylation, and the resulting 3′UTR contain at least one regulatory element. Data presented here indicate that RNA of the short 3′UTR folds to form a strong secondary structure (hairpin). Its regulatory role was established utilizing a luciferase-based reporter system. Further studies led to the identification of a protein factor, which binds to this element—the anti-apoptotic, cytoskeleton-related protein Hax-1. The results of in vitro binding analysis indicate that the formation of the RNA–protein complex is significantly impaired by disruption of the hairpin motif. We demonstrate that Hax-1 binds to Pol β mRNA exclusively in the form of a dimer. Biochemical analysis revealed the presence of Hax-1 in mitochondria, but also in the nuclear matrix, which, along with its transcript-binding properties, suggests that Hax-1 plays a role in post-transcriptional regulation of expression of Pol β.","Sarnowska, Elżbieta; Grzybowska, Ewa A.; Sobczak, Krzysztof; Konopiński, Ryszard; Wilczyńska, Anna; Szwarc, Maria; Sarnowski, Tomasz J.; Krzyżosiak, Włodzimierz J.; Siedlecki, Janusz A.",Nucleic Acids Res,22,1
187,187,187,Studying copy number variations using a nanofluidic platform,9.334589,5.856989,2008-08-18,"Copy number variations (CNVs) in the human genome are conventionally detected using high-throughput scanning technologies, such as comparative genomic hybridization and high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, or relatively low-throughput techniques, such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All these approaches are limited in resolution and can at best distinguish a twofold (or 50%) difference in copy number. We have developed a new technology to study copy numbers using a platform known as the digital array, a nanofluidic biochip capable of accurately quantitating genes of interest in DNA samples. We have evaluated the digital array's performance using a model system, to show that this technology is exquisitely sensitive, capable of differentiating as little as a 15% difference in gene copy number (or between 6 and 7 copies of a target gene). We have also analyzed commercial DNA samples for their CYP2D6 copy numbers and confirmed that our results were consistent with those obtained independently using conventional techniques. In a screening experiment with breast cancer and normal DNA samples, the ERBB2 gene was found to be amplified in about 35% of breast cancer samples. The use of the digital array enables accurate measurement of gene copy numbers and is of significant value in CNV studies.","Qin, Jian; Jones, Robert C.; Ramakrishnan, Ramesh",Nucleic Acids Res,22,1
201,201,201,Delivery of steric block morpholino oligomers by (R-X-R)(4) peptides: structure–activity studies,9.24886,5.7290688,2008-09-16,"Redirecting the splicing machinery through the hybridization of high affinity, RNase H- incompetent oligonucleotide analogs such as phosphoramidate morpholino oligonucleotides (PMO) might lead to important clinical applications. Chemical conjugation of PMO to arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides (CPP) such as (R-Ahx-R)(4) (with Ahx standing for 6-aminohexanoic acid) leads to sequence-specific splicing correction in the absence of endosomolytic agents in cell culture at variance with most conventional CPPs. Importantly, (R-Ahx-R)(4)–PMO conjugates are effective in mouse models of various viral infections and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Unfortunately, active doses in some applications might be close to cytotoxic ones thus presenting challenge for systemic administration of the conjugates in those clinical settings. Structure–activity relationship studies have thus been undertaken to unravel CPP structural features important for the efficient nuclear delivery of the conjugated PMO and limiting steps in their internalization pathway. Affinity for heparin (taken as a model heparan sulfate), hydrophobicity, cellular uptake, intracellular distribution and splicing correction have been monitored. Spacing between the charges, hydrophobicity of the linker between the Arg-groups and Arg-stereochemistry influence splicing correction efficiency. A significant correlation between splicing correction efficiency, affinity for heparin and ability to destabilize model synthetic vesicles has been observed but no correlation with cellular uptake has been found. Efforts will have to focus on endosomal escape since it appears to remain the limiting factor for the delivery of these splice-redirecting ON analogs.","Abes, Rachida; Moulton, Hong M.; Clair, Philippe; Yang, Sung-Tae; Abes, Said; Melikov, Kamran; Prevot, Paul; Youngblood, Derek S.; Iversen, Patrick L.; Chernomordik, Leonid V.; Lebleu, Bernard",Nucleic Acids Res,22,1

377,377,377,DotKnot: pseudoknot prediction using the probability dot plot under a refined energy model,9.040713,5.8362985,2010-01-31,"RNA pseudoknots are functional structure elements with key roles in viral and cellular processes. Prediction of a pseudoknotted minimum free energy structure is an NP-complete problem. Practical algorithms for RNA structure prediction including restricted classes of pseudoknots suffer from high runtime and poor accuracy for longer sequences. A heuristic approach is to search for promising pseudoknot candidates in a sequence and verify those. Afterwards, the detected pseudoknots can be further analysed using bioinformatics or laboratory techniques. We present a novel pseudoknot detection method called DotKnot that extracts stem regions from the secondary structure probability dot plot and assembles pseudoknot candidates in a constructive fashion. We evaluate pseudoknot free energies using novel parameters, which have recently become available. We show that the conventional probability dot plot makes a wide class of pseudoknots including those with bulged stems manageable in an explicit fashion. The energy parameters now become the limiting factor in pseudoknot prediction. DotKnot is an efficient method for long sequences, which finds pseudoknots with higher accuracy compared to other known prediction algorithms.

Changing bases in L2 or base pairs in S1 involved in a base triple resulted in a 2- to 5-fold decrease in frameshifting efficiency. Alterations in the length of L2 had adverse effects on frameshifting. The in vitro effects were well reproduced in vivo, although the effect of enlarging L2 was more dramatic in vivo. The putative role of refolding kinetics of frameshifter pseudoknots is discussed. Overall, the data emphasize the role of the triple helix in −1 frameshifting.","Olsthoorn, René C.

DNA probes, 70-nt long, some including the nucleotide analog deoxyribose-Inosine (dInosine), were analyzed for hybridization tolerance to different amounts and distributions of mismatching bases, e.g. synonymous mutations, in target DNA. Microsphere-linked 70-mer probes were hybridized in 3M TMAC buffer to biotinylated single-stranded (ss) DNA for subsequent analysis in a Luminex® system. When mismatches interrupted contiguous matching stretches of 6 nt or longer, it had a strong impact on hybridization. Contiguous matching stretches are more important than the same number of matching nucleotides separated by mismatches into several regions. dInosine, but not 5-nitroindole, substitutions at mismatching positions stabilized hybridization remarkably well, comparable to N (4-fold) wobbles in the same positions. In contrast to shorter probes, 70-nt probes with judiciously placed dInosine substitutions and/or wobble positions were remarkably mismatch tolerant, with preserved specificity. An algorithm, NucZip, was constructed to model the nucleation and zipping phases of hybridization, integrating both local and distant binding contributions. It predicted hybridization more exactly than previous algorithms, and has the potential to guide the design of variation-tolerant yet specific probes.","Öhrmalm, Christina; Jobs, Magnus; Eriksson, Ronnie; Golbob, Sultan; Elfaitouri, Amal; Benachenhou, Farid; Strømme, Maria; Blomberg, Jonas",Nucleic Acids Res,22,1

An essential element in this process is the presence of an RNA secondary structure, such as a pseudoknot or a hairpin, located downstream of the slippery sequence. Here, we have tested the efficiency of RNA oligonucleotides annealing downstream of the slippery sequence to induce frameshifting in vitro. Maximal frameshifting was observed with oligonucleotides of 12–18 nt. Antisense oligonucleotides bearing locked nucleid acid (LNA) modifications also proved to be efficient frameshift-stimulators in contrast to DNA oligonucleotides. The number, sequence and location of LNA bases in an otherwise DNA oligonucleotide have to be carefully manipulated to obtain optimal levels of frameshifting. Our data favor a model in which RNA stability at the entrance of the ribosomal tunnel is the major determinant of stimulating slippage rather than a specific three-dimensional structure of the stimulating RNA element.","Yu, Chien-Hung; Noteborn, Mathieu H.

541,541,541,Endogenous ribosomal frameshift signals operate as mRNA destabilizing elements through at least two molecular pathways in yeast,9.077845,5.8088765,2010-11-24,"Although first discovered in viruses, previous studies have identified operational −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1 RF) signals in eukaryotic genomic sequences, and suggested a role in mRNA stability. Here, four yeast −1 RF signals are shown to promote significant mRNA destabilization through the nonsense mediated mRNA decay pathway (NMD), and genetic evidence is presented suggesting that they may also operate through the no-go decay pathway (NGD) as well. Yeast EST2 mRNA is highly unstable and contains up to five −1 RF signals. Ablation of the −1 RF signals or of NMD stabilizes this mRNA, and changes in −1 RF efficiency have opposing effects on the steady-state abundance of the EST2 mRNA. These results demonstrate that endogenous −1 RF signals function as mRNA destabilizing elements through at least two molecular pathways in yeast. Consistent with current evolutionary theory, phylogenetic analyses suggest that −1 RF signals are rapidly evolving cis-acting regulatory elements. Identification of high confidence −1 RF signals in ∼10% of genes in all eukaryotic genomes surveyed suggests that −1 RF is a broadly used post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression.","Belew, Ashton T.; Advani, Vivek M.; Dinman, Jonathan D.",Nucleic Acids Res,22,1

Two short open reading frames (sORFs) initiated by AUGs 2 and 3 are also present. To understand translational regulation in this system, we systematically mutated AUGs 1–4 and monitored polypeptide synthesis from plasmids and recombinant viruses. This identified sORF2 as a key regulatory element with opposing effects on PB1-F2 and PB1-N40 expression. We propose a model in which AUGs 1–4 are accessed by leaky ribosomal scanning, with sORF2 repressing synthesis of downstream PB1-F2. However, sORF2 also up-regulates PB1-N40 expression, most likely by a reinitiation mechanism that permits skipping of AUG4. Surprisingly, we also found that in contrast to plasmid-driven expression, viruses with improved AUG1 initiation contexts produced less PB1 in infected cells and replicated poorly, producing virions with elevated particle:PFU ratios. Analysis of the genome content of virus particles showed reduced packaging of the mutant segment 2 vRNAs. Overall, we conclude that segment 2 mRNA translation is regulated by a combination of leaky ribosomal scanning and reinitiation, and that the sequences surrounding the PB1 AUG codon are multifunctional, containing overlapping signals for translation initiation and for segment-specific packaging.","Wise, Helen M.; Barbezange, Cyril; Jagger, Brett W.; Dalton, Rosa M.; Gog, Julia R.; Curran, Martin D.; Taubenberger, Jeffery K.; Anderson, Emma C.; Digard, Paul",Nucleic Acids Res,22,28

Although not capable of triple helix formation they proved worthy stimulators of frameshifting. Subsequent investigation of ∼30 different hairpin constructs revealed that next to thermodynamic stability, loop size and composition and stem irregularities can influence frameshifting.

Much of our understanding of ssRNA conformational behavior is limited to structures in which ssRNA directly engages in tertiary interactions or is recognized by proteins. Little is known about the structural and dynamic behavior of free ssRNAs at atomic resolution. Here, we report the collaborative application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations to characterize the 12 nt ssRNA tail derived from the prequeuosine riboswitch. NMR carbon spin relaxation data and residual dipolar coupling measurements reveal a flexible yet stacked core adopting an A-form-like conformation, with the level of order decreasing toward the terminal ends. An A-to-C mutation within the polyadenine tract alters the observed dynamics consistent with the introduction of a dynamic kink. Pre-ordering of the tail may increase the efficacy of ligand binding above that achieved by a random-coil ssRNA. The REMD simulations recapitulate important trends in the NMR data, but suggest more internal motions than inferred from the NMR analysis. Our study unmasks a previously unappreciated level of complexity in ssRNA, which we believe will also serve as an excellent model system for testing and developing computational force fields.","Eichhorn, Catherine D.; Feng, Jun; Suddala, Krishna C.; Walter, Nils G.; Brooks, Charles L.; Al-Hashimi, Hashim M.",Nucleic Acids Res,22,1

The activity of these proteins, in turn, can be modulated by the phospholipid composition of the membrane. The reconstitution of membrane proteins into a model membrane allows investigation of individual features and activities of a given cell membrane component. However, the activity of membrane proteins is often difficult to sustain following reconstitution, since the composition of the model phospholipid bilayer differs from that of the native cell membrane. This review will discuss the reconstitution of membrane protein activities in four different types of model membrane—monolayers, supported lipid bilayers, liposomes and nanodiscs, comparing their advantages in membrane protein reconstitution. Variation in the surrounding model environments for these four different types of membrane layer can affect the three-dimensional structure of reconstituted proteins and may possibly lead to loss of the proteins activity. We also discuss examples where the same membrane proteins have been successfully reconstituted into two or more model membrane systems with comparison of the observed activity in each system. Understanding of the behavioral changes for proteins in model membrane systems after membrane reconstitution is often a prerequisite to protein research. It is essential to find better solutions for retaining membrane protein activities for measurement and characterization in vitro.","Shen, Hsin-Hui; Lithgow, Trevor; Martin, Lisandra L.",Int J Mol Sci,22,1

As disrupting the TL1/PK2 interaction, via ‘flipping’ mutations of PK2, previously attenuated DENV replication, this pseudoknot may participate in regulation of RNA synthesis. Computer modeling implied that this motif might function as autonomous structural/regulatory element. In addition, our studies targeting elements of the 3′ DB and its complementary region PK1 indicated that communication between 5′–3′ terminal regions strongly depends on structure and sequence composition of the 5′ cyclization region.","Sztuba-Solinska, Joanna; Teramoto, Tadahisa; Rausch, Jason W.; Shapiro, Bruce A.; Padmanabhan, Radhakrishnan; Le Grice, Stuart F.

These unique motifs have been extensively studied on the DNA level; however, exploration of the biological roles of G4s at the RNA level is just emerging. Here we show that G4 RNA when introduced within coding regions are capable of stimulating −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1 FS) in vitro and in cultured cells. Systematic manipulation of the loop length between each G-tract revealed that the −1 FS efficiency positively correlates with G4 stability. Addition of a G4-stabilizing ligand, PhenDC3, resulted in higher −1 FS. Further, we demonstrated that the G4s can stimulate +1 FS and stop codon readthrough as well. These results suggest a potentially novel translational gene regulation mechanism mediated by G4 RNA.","Yu, Chien-Hung; Teulade-Fichou, Marie-Paule; Olsthoorn, René C. L.",Nucleic Acids Res,22,1

MnmEG catalyzes two different modification reactions, which add an aminomethyl (nm) or carboxymethylaminomethyl (cmnm) group to position 5 of the anticodon wobble uridine using ammonium or glycine, respectively. In [Image: see text] and [Image: see text], however, cmnm(5) appears as the final modification, whereas in the remaining tRNAs, the MnmEG products are converted into 5-methylaminomethyl (mnm(5)) through the two-domain, bi-functional enzyme MnmC. MnmC(o) transforms cmnm(5) into nm(5), whereas MnmC(m) converts nm(5) into mnm(5), thus producing an atypical network of modification pathways. We investigate the activities and tRNA specificity of MnmEG and the MnmC domains, the ability of tRNAs to follow the ammonium or glycine pathway and the effect of mnmC mutations on growth. We demonstrate that the two MnmC domains function independently of each other and that [Image: see text] and [Image: see text] are substrates for MnmC(m), but not MnmC(o). Synthesis of mnm(5)s(2)U by MnmEG-MnmC in vivo avoids build-up of intermediates in [Image: see text]. We also show that MnmEG can modify all the tRNAs via the ammonium pathway. Strikingly, the net output of the MnmEG pathways in vivo depends on growth conditions and tRNA species. Loss of any MnmC activity has a biological cost under specific conditions.","Moukadiri, Ismaïl; Garzón, M.-José; Björk, Glenn R.; Armengod, M.-Eugenia",Nucleic Acids Res,22,1

Pip6a-PMO, a recently developed conjugate, is particularly efficient in a murine DMD model, although mechanisms responsible for its increased biological activity have not been studied. Here, we evaluate the cellular trafficking and the biological activity of Pip6a-PMO in skeletal muscle cells and primary cardiomyocytes. Our results indicate that Pip6a-PMO is taken up in the skeletal muscle cells by an energy- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Interestingly, its cellular distribution is different in undifferentiated and differentiated skeletal muscle cells (vesicular versus nuclear). Likewise, Pip6a-PMO mainly accumulates in cytoplasmic vesicles in primary cardiomyocytes, in which clathrin-mediated endocytosis seems to be the pre-dominant uptake pathway. These differences in cellular trafficking correspond well with the exon-skipping data, with higher activity in myotubes than in myoblasts or cardiomyocytes. These differences in cellular trafficking thus provide a possible mechanistic explanation for the variations in exon-skipping activity and restoration of dystrophin protein in heart muscle compared with skeletal muscle tissues in DMD models. Overall, Pip6a-PMO appears as the most efficient conjugate to date (low nanomolar EC(50)), even if limitations remain from endosomal escape.","Lehto, Taavi; Castillo Alvarez, Alejandra; Gauck, Sarah; Gait, Michael J.; Coursindel, Thibault; Wood, Matthew J.

Suppressing the level and transcriptional activity of cccDNA might have anti-HBV effect. Although cellular transcription factors, such as CREB, which mediate HBV transcription, have been well described, transcriptional coactivators that facilitate this process are incompletely understood. In this study we showed that CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivator 1 (CRTC1) is required for HBV transcription and replication. The steady-state levels of CRTC1 protein were elevated in HBV-positive hepatoma cells and liver tissues. Ectopic expression of CRTC1 or its homolog CRTC2 or CRTC3 in hepatoma cells stimulated the activity of the preS2/S promoter of HBV, whereas overexpression of a dominant inactive form of CRTC1 inhibited HBV transcription. CRTC1 interacts with CREB and they are mutually required for the recruitment to the preS2/S promoter on cccDNA and for the activation of HBV transcription. Accumulation of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and cccDNA was observed when CRTC1 or its homologs were overexpressed, whereas the levels of pgRNA, cccDNA and secreted HBsAg were diminished when CRTC1 was compromised. In addition, HBV transactivator protein HBx stabilized CRTC1 and promoted its activity on HBV transcription. Our work reveals an essential role of CRTC1 coactivator in facilitating and supporting HBV transcription and replication.","Tang, Hei-Man Vincent; Gao, Wei-Wei; Chan, Chi-Ping; Cheng, Yun; Chaudhary, Vidyanath; Deng, Jian-Jun; Yuen, Kit-San; Wong, Chun-Ming; Ng, Irene Oi-Lin; Kok, Kin-Hang; Zhou, Jie; Jin, Dong-Yan",Nucleic Acids Res,22,28

Previous studies have shown that SIRT7 is required for RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription and pre-rRNA processing. Here, we took a proteomic approach to identify novel molecular targets and characterize the role of SIRT7 in non-nucleolar processes. We show that SIRT7 interacts with numerous proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and RNA metabolism, the majority of interactions requiring ongoing transcription. In addition to its role in Pol I transcription, we found that SIRT7 also regulates transcription of snoRNAs and mRNAs. Mechanistically, SIRT7 promotes the release of P-TEFb from the inactive 7SK snRNP complex and deacetylates CDK9, a subunit of the elongation factor P-TEFb, which activates transcription by phosphorylating serine 2 within the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II. SIRT7 counteracts GCN5-directed acetylation of lysine 48 within the catalytic domain of CDK9, deacetylation promoting CTD phosphorylation and transcription elongation.","Blank, Maximilian F.; Chen, Sifan; Poetz, Fabian; Schnölzer, Martina; Voit, Renate; Grummt, Ingrid",Nucleic Acids Res,22,1

Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) between (Cy5)EF-G and (Cy3)tRNA(Lys), we studied the translational elongation dynamics of -1PRF in the Escherichia coli dnaX gene, which contains three frameshifting signals: a slippery sequence (A AAA AAG), a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and a downstream hairpin. The frameshift promoting signals mostly impair the EF-G-catalyzed translocation step of the two tRNA(Lys) and the slippery codons from the A- and P- sites. The hairpin acts as a road block slowing the translocation rate. The upstream SD sequence together with the hairpin promotes dissociation of futile EF-G and thus causes multiple EF-G driven translocation attempts. A slippery sequence also helps dissociation of the EF-G by providing alternative base-pairing options. These results indicate that frameshifting takes place during the repetitive ribosomal conformational changes associated with EF-G dissociation upon unsuccessful translocation attempts of the second slippage codon from the A- to the P- sites.","Kim, Hee-Kyung; Tinoco, Ignacio",Nucleic Acids Res,22,1

In addition to its well-known role of binding iron, lactoferrin carries many important biological functions, including the promotion of cell proliferation and differentiation, and as an anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-parasitic protein. These functions differ among lactoferrin homologs in mammals. Although considerable attention has been given to the many functions of lactoferrin, its primary nutritional contribution is presumed to be related to its iron-binding characteristics, whereas the role of glycosylation has been neglected. Given the critical role of glycan binding in many biological processes, the glycan moieties in lactoferrin are likely to contribute significantly to the biological roles of lactoferrin. Despite the high amino acid sequence homology in different lactoferrins (up to 99%), each exhibits a unique glycosylation pattern that may be responsible for heterogeneity of the biological properties of lactoferrins. An important task for the production of biotherapeutics and medical foods containing bioactive glycoproteins is the assessment of the contributions of individual glycans to the observed bioactivities. This review examines how the study of lactoferrin glycosylation patterns can increase our understanding of lactoferrin functionality.","Karav, Sercan; German, J.

Conformational microstate transitions on the 1.0 ns to 10.0 μs timescales were observed, with post-equilibration sampling providing detailed representations of the conformational free energy landscape and the complex folding mechanism inherent to the pseudoknot motif.

While in line with previous thermodynamics-based models of a general RNA folding mechanism, our observations indicate that stem-strand-sequence-separation may serve as an alternative predictor of the order of stem formation during pseudoknot folding. Our results contradict a model of frameshifting based on structural rigidity and resistance to mechanical unfolding, and instead strongly support more recent studies in which conformational plasticity is identified as a determining factor in frameshifting efficiency.","Q.

Obese insulin-resistant humans with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease manifest loss of hepatic CEACAM1.

This is followed by inflammation and endothelial and cardiovascular dysfunctions. In obstructive and inflammatory liver diseases, soluble CEACAM1 is shed into human bile where it can serve as an indicator of liver disease.

Apart from that, numerous studies have also characterized antioxidant properties of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), which is suppressed in an obese state. The induction of HO-1 restores cellular redox processes, which contributes to inhibition of the toxic milieu. The novelty of these independent mechanisms presents a unique opportunity to unravel their potential as molecular targets for redox regulation in obesity and NASH. The attenuation of oxidative stress, by understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms and associated mediators, with a targeted treatment modality may provide for improved therapeutic options to combat clinical disorders.","Pratt, Rebecca; Lakhani, Hari Vishal; Zehra, Mishghan; Desauguste, Rutmann; Pillai, Sneha S.; Sodhi, Komal",Int J Mol Sci,22,1

These G proteins have a heterotrimeric structure composed of α, β, and γ subunits. The α subunits of the G proteins bind GTP and appear to determine the biochemical specificity of the protein. We have recently cloned and characterized cDNA encoding two G-protein α subunits, α(i) and α(h). The former is a substrate for ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin. The protein corresponding to α(h) has not yet been identified. These cDNAs encode proteins, which demonstrate 90% sequence identity to one another and also show marked similarity to other G proteins. The present studies were designed to determine whether the genes for these related proteins are clustered on a single human chromosome. Genomic DNA isolated from a panel of mouse-human hybrid cell lines was analyzed by hybridization to cDNAs for α(i) and α(h). Based on the distribution patterns of α(i) and α(h) in cell hybrids, the gene for α(i) was assigned to human chromosome 7, and the gene for α(h) assigned to chromosome 12. These data suggest that the G-protein gene family may be distributed over at least two human chromosomes.","Neer, Eva J.; Michel, Thomas; Eddy, Roger; Shows, Thomas; Seidman, J. G.",Hum Genet,22,11

Importantly, infections in the elderly are more frequent, more severe and have distinct features with respect to clinical presentation and treatment. This is due to a decline in the functions of the immune system referred to as immunosenescence. The most important age-related changes affect the T cell system. Although this derogates the protective effect of some vaccines, vaccinations are still considered the most cost-effective medical procedure for preventing morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases. The present article aims at outlining the impact of infectious diseases on the elderly and summarizing the progress made in the field of vaccinations of the elderly and how age-related changes within the immune system contribute to the decreased efficacy of vaccines.","Herndler-Brandstetter, Dietmar; Cioca, Daniel P.; Grubeck-Loebenstein, Beatrix",Wien Med Wochenschr,22,11

In addition, blood from challenged cats was inoculated into naive SPF cats to confirm the viral status of the vaccinated cats. All cats immunized with Petaluma vaccine alone were protected against homologous Petaluma challenge, but only one of four cats was protected against heterologous Shizuoka challenge. More importantly, all cats immunized with the dual-subtype vaccine were protected against both Petaluma and Shizuoka challenges. These results suggest that a multi-subtype vaccine approach may provide the broad-spectrum immunity necessary for vaccine protection against strains from different subtypes.","Hohdatsu, Tsutomu; Okada, Susumu; Motokawa, Kenji; Aizawa, Chikara; Yamamoto, Janet K.; Koyama, Hiroyuki",Vet Microbiol,22,28

However, it is antigenically and genetically distinct from HIV; an antigenic relatedness with equine infectious anaemia virus has been demonstrated. FIV has been molecularly cloned and sequenced. Diagnostic tests are commercially available and attempts at preparing inactivated, subunit and molecularly engineered vaccines are being made in different laboratories. During FIV infection a transient primary illness can be recognized, with fever, neutropenia and lymphadenopathy. After a long period of clinical normalcy a secondary stage is distinguished with signs of an immunodeficiency-like syndrome. The incubation period for this stage can be as long as 5 years, during which gradual impairment of immune function develops. Many FIV-infected cats are presented for the first time showing vague signs of illness: recurrent fevers, emaciation, lack of appetite, lymphadenopathy, anaemia, leucopenia and behavioural changes. Later, the predominant clinical signs observed are chronic stomatitis/gingivitis, enteritis, upper respiratory tract infections, and infections of the skin. Neoplasias, neurological, immunological and haematological disorder are seen in a smaller proportion. The immunodeficiency-like syndrome is progressive over a period of months to years. Concomitant infection with feline leukaemia virus has been shown to accelarate the progression of disease. In vitro, phenotypic mixing between FIV and an endogenous feline oncovirus (RD114) has been demonstrated which leads to a broadening of the cell spectrum of the lentivirus. Bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) has been isolated only once, and all attempts to obtain additional isolates have failed; it has been recovered from the leucocytes of cattle with persistent lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, lesions in the central nervous system, progressive weakness and emaciation. As with the feline representative, BIV also was found to possess a lentivirus morphology and to encode a reverse transcriptase with Mg(++) preference; it replicates and induces syncytia in a variety of embryonic bovine tissues in vitro. Antigenic analyses have demonstrated a conservation of epitopes between the major core protein of BIV and HIV. The original isolate has been molecularly cloned and sequenced. Besides the three large open reading frames (ORFs) comprising the gag, pol, and env genes common to all replication-competent retroviruses, five additional small ORFs were found. Numerous point mutations and deletions were found, mostly in the env-encoding ORF. These data suggest that, within a single virus isolate, BIV displays extensive genomic variation. When random cattle sera from the Netherlands were tested by indirect immunofluorescence, Western blot and/or radio-immunoprecipitation, 0.7% appeared seropositive; thus BIV infection is not uncommon in one European cattle population.","Egberink, H.; Horzinek, M.C.",Vet Microbiol,22,28

Most TGEV isolates produced a typical cytopathic effect (CPE) in swine testis (ST) cell culture, which included a ballooning or lifting away of the infected cells from the cell monolayer with heavy granulation evident. Minor variations in CPE were observed with one isolate, IA-145. Protein profiles of the TGEV isolates as determined by SDS-PAGE were essentially identical, with the exception of the isolate IA-101. The TGEV isolate IA-101 presented a higher molecular mass M protein and lacked an N protein doublet that was present in all other TGEV isolates. The TGEV isolates were shown to be closely related antigenically by using hyperimmune sera in a virus neutralization (VN) test. Some antigenic diversity was detected by utilizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in a VN test. Titers of the mAbs were highest with the homologous Miller TGEV, and one virus isolate, IA-156, was very poorly neutralized with the mAbs used in this study. Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) results were similar to those obtained by the VN test. These studies show that some biologic and antigenic diversity exists among TGEV isolates.","Vaughn, Eric M.; Paul, Prem S.",Vet Microbiol,22,1

Rotavirus excretion was not detected in faeces from cows around parturition by any of the three tests. However, all of their calves shed rotaviruses during the observation period. The onset of rotavirus excretion determined by PAGE ranged from day 2 to day 8 of life (day 4.8± 1.8 on average) and lasted for 4 to 7 days (5.3±1.1 days on average). Chi-square test showed a significant association (P=0.0001) between the presence of rotavirus and the altered consistency of calves faeces. All the three tests showed similar results (overall agreement 92.5%) but discrepancies were detected mainly at the beginning or at the end of the rotavirus excretion period.

Twenty-six subjects (12 males, 14 females, mean age 23 years 10 months, age range 18–39 years) were tested once a week for a period of a month. Fifteen subjects were suffering from a common cold on the first week and the other 11 subjects were matched healthy controls. Subjects attended for an initial 3-h testing period that consisted of a set of practice trials and two test sessions involving mood rating and performance of a battery of tests measuring psychomotor functions, attention, and memory. Sessions 3, 4, and 5 took place 1, 2, and 3 weeks later, respectively. In addition to measuring mood and mental performance, symptom severity was rated on a subjective checklist. The results showed that subjects with a cold reported an increase in negative mood and that this was only significant in the first week. Impairments of psychomotor function (simple reaction time and tracking) were also observed at this time. Performance of sustained and selective attention tasks was also impaired in subjects with colds but this effect was only significant in the second week. Other functions such as working and semantic memory were unimpaired in subjects with colds at any point in the experiment. Overall, the present results confirm many of the earlier results obtained in studies of experimentally induced upper respiratory tract illnesses. Indeed, these results are both of great practical importance and theoretical interest and further studies must now elucidate the mechanisms underlying these effects.","Hall, Sara; Smith, Andrew",Physiol Behav,22,28

The spread of TB is highly dependent on people migration between cities or regions that may have different contact rates and different environmental parameters, leading to different disease spread speed in the population. In this work, a metapopulation model, i.e., networks of populations connected by migratory flows, which overcomes the assumption of homogeneous mixing between different regions was constructed. The TB model was combined to a simple demographic structure for the population living in a multi-patch environment (cities, towns, regions or countries). The model consist of a system of differential equations coupling TB epidemic at different strength and mobility between the patches. Constant recruitment rate, slow and fast progression to the disease, effective chemoprophylaxis, diagnostic and treatment are taken into account to make the model including the reality of people in the sub-Saharan African countries. The basic reproduction number ([Formula: see text] ) was computed and it was demonstrated that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if [Formula: see text] . When [Formula: see text] , the disease-free equilibrium is unstable and there exists one endemic equilibrium.

The MAPK cascades are mainly composed by three proteins, MAPKKKs, MAPKKs and MAPKs. Some signals induce MAPKKK-mediated phosphorylation and activation of MAPKK that phosphorylate and activate MAPK. Afterward, MAPKs can act either in the cytoplasm or be imported into the nucleus to activate other proteins or transcription factors. In the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii the pathway for nitrogen (N) assimilation is well characterized, yet its regulation still has many unknown features. Nitric oxide (NO) is a fundamental signal molecule for N regulation, where nitrate reductase (NR) plays a central role in its synthesis. The MAPK cascades could be regulating N assimilation, since it has been described that the phosphorylation of NR by MAPK6 promotes NO production in Arabidopsis thaliana. We have identified the proteins involved in the MAPK cascades in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, finding 17 MAPKs, 2 MAPKKs and 108 MAPKKKs (11 MEKK-, 94 RAF- and 3 ZIK-type) that have been structurally and phylogenetically characterized. The genetic expressions of MAPKs and the MAPKK were slightly regulated by N. However, the genetic expressions of MAPKKKs RAF14 and RAF79 showed a very strong repression by ammonium, which suggests that they may have a key role in the regulation of N assimilation, encouraging to further analyze in detail the role of MAPK cascades in the regulation of N metabolism.","Gomez-Osuna, Aitor; Calatrava, Victoria; Galvan, Aurora; Fernandez, Emilio; Llamas, Angel",Int J Mol Sci,22,1

Compared with the traditional nucleic acid amplification detection method, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing technology has the advantages of being label-free, having simple operation, and providing real-time detection. However, the angle scanning system in many SPR angle modulation detection applications usually requires a high-resolution stepper motor and complex mechanical structure to adjust the angle. In this paper, a portable multi-angle scanning SPR sensor was designed. The sensor only uses one stepping motor to rotate a belt, and the belt pulls the mechanical linkages of incident light and reflected light to move in opposite directions for achieving the SPR angle scanning mode that keeps the incident angle and reflected angle equal. The sensor has an angle scanning accuracy of 0.002°, response sensitivity of 3.72 × 10(−6) RIU (refractive index unit), and an angle scanning range of 30°–74°. The overall size of the system is only 480 mm × 150 mm × 180 mm. The portable SPR sensor was used to detect nucleic acid hybridization on a gold film chip modified with bovine serum albumin (BSA).

Herein, we developed G12msi, a gemcitabine-incorporated DNA aptamer, targeting GPC3, and evaluated its binding specificity and anti-tumor efficacy in GPC3-overexpressing HCC cell lines and murine xenograft models. GPC3-targeted aptamers were selected by using the SELEX process and the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine was internally incorporated into the aptamer. To determine the binding affinity and internalization of the G12msi, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy were performed on GPC3-positive HepG2, Hep3B, and Huh7 cells, as well as a GPC3-negative A431 cell. The anti-tumor activities of G12msi were evaluated with in vitro and in vivo models. We found that G12msi binds to GPC3-overexpressing HCC tumor cells with high specificity and is effectively internalized. Moreover, G12msi treatment inhibited the cell proliferation of GPC3-positive HCC cell lines with minimal cytotoxicity in control A431 cells.

They were tested against human multiple myeloma (RPMI 8226), lung carcinoma (A549), breast adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB-231), and mouse skin melanoma (B16-F10) cell lines. Toxicity was tested on human normal skin fibroblasts (HSF) and normal colon fibroblasts (CCD-18Co). The growth inhibition mechanism of the most active derivative was analyzed through investigation of its effect on the distribution of cell cycle phases and ability to induce apoptosis and necrosis in RPMI 8226 and A549 cancer cells. The tyrosinase inhibitory potential was assessed, followed by molecular docking studies. Compounds 3a–3h show high anticancer activity against MDA-MB-231 and B16-F10 cell lines with IC(50) values of 1.51–3.03 µM. Moreover, the cytotoxic activity of the investigated compounds against HSF and CCD-18Co cells was 8–70 times lower than against the cancer cells or no toxicity was shown in our tests, with derivative 3a being particularly successful. The mechanism of action of compound 3a in RPMI 8226 cell was shown to be through induction of cell death through apoptosis. The derivatives show ability to inhibit the tyrosinase activity with a mixed mechanism of inhibition. The final molecular docking results showed for IC(50) distinct correlation with experiment.","Piechowska, Katarzyna; Mizerska-Kowalska, Magdalena; Zdzisińska, Barbara; Cytarska, Joanna; Baranowska-Łączkowska, Angelika; Jaroch, Karol; Łuczykowski, Kamil; Płaziński, Wojciech; Bojko, Barbara; Kruszewski, Stefan; Misiura, Konrad; Łączkowski, Krzysztof Z.",Int J Mol Sci,22,1

While reversing this quiescence is an effective approach to reactivate latent HIV from T cells in culture, it can cause deleterious cytokine dysregulation in patients. As a key regulator of T-cell quiescence, FOXO1 promotes latency and suppresses productive HIV infection. We report that in resting T cells, FOXO1 inhibition impaired autophagy and induced ER stress, thereby activating two associated transcription factors: activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Both factors associate with HIV chromatin and were for HIV reactivation. Indeed, inhibition of PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), an ER stress sensor that can mediate the induction of ATF4, and calcineurin, a calcium-dependent regulator of NFAT, synergistically suppressed HIV reactivation induced by FOXO1 inhibition. Thus, our studies uncover a link between FOXO1, ER stress, and HIV infection that could be therapeutically exploited to selectively reverse T-cell quiescence and reduce the size of the latent viral reservoir.","Vallejo-Gracia, Albert; Chen, Irene P.; Perrone, Rosalba; Besnard, Emilie; Boehm, Daniela; Battivelli, Emilie; Tezil, Tugsan; Krey, Karsten; Raymond, Kyle A.; Hull, Philip A.; Walter, Marius; Habrylo, Ireneusz; Cruz, Andrew; Deeks, Steven; Pillai, Satish; Verdin, Eric; Ott, Melanie",Nat Microbiol,22,1

Selective drug pressure, fungal attributes, and host- and drug-related factors have counteracted the efficacy of the limited systemic antifungal drugs and changed the epidemiological landscape of IFIs. Species belonging to Candida, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Pneumocystis are among the fungal pathogens showing notable rates of antifungal resistance. Drug-resistant fungi from the environment are increasingly identified in clinical settings. Furthermore, we have a limited understanding of drug class-specific resistance mechanisms in emerging Candida species. The establishment of antifungal stewardship programs in both clinical and agricultural fields and the inclusion of species identification, antifungal susceptibility testing, and therapeutic drug monitoring practices in the clinic can minimize the emergence of drug-resistant fungi. New antifungal drugs featuring promising therapeutic profiles have great promise to treat drug-resistant fungi in the clinical setting. Mitigating antifungal tolerance, a prelude to the emergence of resistance, also requires the development of effective and fungal-specific adjuvants to be used in combination with systemic antifungals.","Arastehfar, Amir; Gabaldón, Toni; Garcia-Rubio, Rocio; Jenks, Jeffrey D.; Hoenigl, Martin; Salzer, Helmut J.

Response Surface Methodology was used to understand the relationships between the parameters. The experimental data were then fit into mathematical models. The results, for the first time, revealed that the licorice solutions had non-Newtonian shear-thinning behaviors with flow behavior indexes of 0.24 to 0.91, depending on the licorice extract samples, temperature, and °Bx. These observations were different from those reported in the literature and the present study elaborated on reasons for such observations. Further, the shear-thinning behavior generally increased by increasing the °Bx and decreasing the temperature. In addition, the power-law model was found to be suitable for predicting the experimental data.

Because growth lags can be large compared to typical doubling times, variations in growth lag are an important but often overlooked component of bacterial fitness in fluctuating environments. We here explore how growth lag variation is determined for the archetypical switch from glucose to lactose as a carbon source in Escherichia coli. First, we show that single-cell lags are bimodally distributed and controlled by a single-molecule trigger. That is, gene expression noise causes the population before the switch to divide into subpopulations with zero and nonzero lac operon expression. While “sensorless” cells with zero preexisting lac expression at the switch have long lags because they are unable to sense the lactose signal, any nonzero lac operon expression suffices to ensure a short lag. Second, we show that the growth lag at the population level depends crucially on the fraction of sensorless cells and that this fraction in turn depends sensitively on the growth condition before the switch. Consequently, even small changes in basal expression can significantly affect the fraction of sensorless cells, thereby population lags and fitness under switching conditions, and may thus be subject to significant natural selection. Indeed, we show that condition-dependent population lags vary across wild E. coli isolates. Since many sensory genes are naturally low expressed in conditions where their inducer is not present, bimodal responses due to subpopulations of sensorless cells may be a general mechanism inducing phenotypic heterogeneity and controlling population lags in switching environments. This mechanism also illustrates how gene expression noise can turn even a simple sensory gene circuit into a bet hedging module and underlines the profound role of gene expression noise in regulatory responses.","Julou, Thomas; Zweifel, Ludovit; Blank, Diana; Fiori, Athos; van Nimwegen, Erik",PLoS Biol,22,1

Although passive immunotherapy is a fast and effective method of protection, large-scale production and administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is expensive and unpractical. Viral vector-mediated delivery of mAbs offers an attractive alternative to their direct injection. Integrase-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLV) are advantageous for this purpose due to the absence of pre-existing anti-vector immunity and the safety features of non-integration and non-replication. We engineered IDLV to produce the humanized mAb VN04-2 (IDLV-VN04-2), which is broadly neutralizing against H5 influenza A virus (IAV), and tested the vectors’ ability to produce antibodies and protect from IAV in vivo. We found that IDLV-transduced cells produced functional VN04-2 mAbs in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. These mAbs specifically bind the hemagglutinin (HA), but not the nucleoprotein (NP) of IAV. VN04-2 mAbs were detected in the serum of mice at different times after intranasal (i.n.) or intramuscular (i.m.) administration of IDLV-VN04-2. Administration of IDLV-VN04-2 by the i.n. route provided rapid protection against lethal IAV challenge, although the protection did not persist at later time points. Our data suggest that administration of mAb-expressing IDLV may represent an effective strategy for rapid protection against infectious diseases.","Michelini, Zuleika; Minkoff, Judith M.; Yang, Jianjun; Negri, Donatella; Cara, Andrea; Hanson, Brendon J.; Salvatore, Mirella",Viruses,22,1

Such direct anthropogenic emissions are gaining importance, as those from furnishings and building materials have become better regulated and energy efficient homes may reduce ventilation. While previous studies have characterized human emissions in indoor environments, the question remains whether VOCs remain unidentified by current measuring techniques. In this study conducted in a climate chamber occupied by four people, the total OH reactivity of air was quantified, together with multiple VOCs measured by proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) and fast gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (fast-GC–MS). Whole-body, breath, and dermal emissions were assessed. The comparison of directly measured OH reactivity and that of the summed reactivity of individually measured species revealed no significant shortfall. Ozone exposure (37 ppb) was found to have little influence on breath OH reactivity but enhanced dermal OH reactivity significantly. Without ozone, the whole-body OH reactivity was dominated by breath emissions, mostly isoprene (76%). With ozone present, OH reactivity nearly doubled, with the increase being mainly caused by dermal emissions of mostly carbonyl compounds (57%). No significant difference in total OH reactivity was observed for different age groups (teenagers/young adults/seniors) without ozone. With ozone present, the total OH reactivity decreased slightly with increasing age.","Wang, Nijing; Zannoni, Nora; Ernle, Lisa; Bekö, Gabriel; Wargocki, Pawel; Li, Mengze; Weschler, Charles J.; Williams, Jonathan",Environ Sci Technol,22,1

The present study aimed to investigate the in vitro effects of total protein extracts from three modern and two landrace Triticum aestivum commercial flour mixes, with significant differences in gluten strength (GS), on cell lines. Cytotoxicity and innate immune responses induced by wheat proteins were investigated using Caco-2 monocultures, two dimensional (2D) Caco-2/U937 co-cultures, and three dimensional (3D) co-cultures simulating the intestinal mucosa with Caco-2 epithelial cells situated above an extra-cellular matrix containing U937 monocytes and L929 fibroblasts. Modern wheat proteins, with increased GS, significantly reduced Caco-2 cell proliferation and vitality in monoculture and 2D co-cultures than landrace proteins. Modern wheat proteins also augmented Caco-2 monolayer disruption and tight junction protein, occludin, redistribution in 3D co-cultures. Release of interleukin-8 into the cell medium and increased U937 monocyte migration in both 2D and 3D co-cultures were similarly apparent. Immuno-activation of migrating U937 cells was evidenced from cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) staining and CD11b-related differentiation into macrophages.

In this paper, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been adapted to predict and classify lymph node metastasis in breast cancer. We observe that image resolutions of lymph node metastasis datasets in breast cancer usually are quite smaller than the designed model input resolution, which defects the performance of the proposed model. To mitigate this problem, we propose a boosted CNN architecture and a novel data augmentation method called Random Center Cropping (RCC). Different from traditional image cropping methods only suitable for resolution images in large scale, RCC not only enlarges the scale of datasets but also preserves the resolution and the center area of images. In addition, the downsampling scale of the network is diminished to be more suitable for small resolution images. Furthermore, we introduce attention and feature fusion mechanisms to enhance the semantic information of image features extracted by CNN. Experiments illustrate that our methods significantly boost performance of fundamental CNN architectures, where the best-performed method achieves an accuracy of 97.96% ± 0.03% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 99.68% ± 0.01% in Rectified Patch Camelyon (RPCam) datasets, respectively. ABSTRACT: (1) Purpose: To improve the capability of EfficientNet, including developing a cropping method called Random Center Cropping (RCC) to retain the original image resolution and significant features on the images’ center area, reducing the downsampling scale of EfficientNet to facilitate the small resolution images of RPCam datasets, and integrating attention and Feature Fusion (FF) mechanisms with EfficientNet to obtain features containing rich semantic information. (2) Methods: We adopt the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and classify lymph node metastasis in breast cancer. (3) Results: Experiments illustrate that our methods significantly boost performance of basic CNN architectures, where the best-performed method achieves an accuracy of 97.96% ± 0.03% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 99.68% ± 0.01% on RPCam datasets, respectively.

The advent of single-cell multi-omics techniques has allowed us to begin to comprehensively dissect cellular heterogeneity and access biological information unobtainable from bulk analysis. Applications cover many fields and are increasingly numerous. This review aims to summarize the most important applications of single-cell technologies in hematological tumors, providing a translational view. Data show the power of single-cell multi-omics to resolve the complex biology of heterogeneous populations and to derive information that can be used to improve treatment strategies. We discuss, with a practical example, how to make use of these techniques to study the heterogeneity of a specific type of monoclonal gammopathy called Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia. ABSTRACT: Single-cell sequencing techniques have become a powerful tool for characterizing intra-tumor heterogeneity, which has been reflected in the increasing number of studies carried out and reported. We have rigorously reviewed and compiled the information about these techniques inasmuch as they are relative to the area of hematology to provide a practical view of their potential applications. Studies show how single-cell multi-omics can overcome the limitations of bulk sequencing and be applied at all stages of tumor development, giving insights into the origin and pathogenesis of the tumors, the clonal architecture and evolution, or the mechanisms of therapy resistance. Information at the single-cell level may help resolve questions related to intra-tumor heterogeneity that have not been previously explained by other techniques. With that in mind, we review the existing knowledge about a heterogeneous lymphoma called Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia and discuss how single-cell studies may help elucidate the underlying causes of this heterogeneity.","García-Sanz, Ramón; Jiménez, Cristina",Cancers (Basel),22,1

We assessed whether homelessness or unstable housing is associated with an increased risk of HIV or HCV acquisition among PWID compared with PWID who are not homeless or are stably housed. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we updated an existing database of HIV and HCV incidence studies published between Jan 1, 2000, and June 13, 2017. Using the same strategy as for this existing database, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO for studies, including conference abstracts, published between June 13, 2017, and Sept 14, 2020, that estimated HIV or HCV incidence, or both, among community-recruited PWID. We only included studies reporting original results without restrictions to study design or language. We contacted authors of studies that reported HIV or HCV incidence, or both, but did not report on an association with homelessness or unstable housing, to request crude data and, where possible, adjusted effect estimates. We extracted effect estimates and pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to quantify the associations between recent (current or within the past year) homelessness or unstable housing compared with not recent homelessness or unstable housing, and risk of HIV or HCV acquisition. We assessed risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and between-study heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic and p value for heterogeneity. FINDINGS: We identified 14 351 references in our database search, of which 392 were subjected to full-text review alongside 277 studies from our existing database. Of these studies, 55 studies met inclusion criteria. We contacted the authors of 227 studies that reported HIV or HCV incidence in PWID but did not report association with the exposure of interest and obtained 48 unpublished estimates from 21 studies. After removal of duplicate data, we included 37 studies with 70 estimates (26 for HIV; 44 for HCV). Studies originated from 16 countries including in North America, Europe, Australia, east Africa, and Asia. Pooling unadjusted estimates, recent homelessness or unstable housing was associated with an increased risk of acquiring HIV (crude relative risk [cRR] 1·55 [95% CI 1·23–1·95; p=0·0002]; I(2)= 62·7%; n=17) and HCV (1·65 [1·44–1·90; p<0·0001]; I(2)= 44·8%; n=28]) among PWID compared with those who were not homeless or were stably housed. Associations for both HIV and HCV persisted when pooling adjusted estimates (adjusted relative risk for HIV: 1·39 [95% CI 1·06–1·84; p=0·019]; I(2)= 65·5%; n=9; and for HCV: 1·64 [1·43–1·89; p<0·0001]; I(2)= 9·6%; n=14). For risk of HIV acquisition, the association for unstable housing (cRR 1·82 [1·13–2·95; p=0·014]; n=5) was higher than for homelessness (1·44 [1·13–1·83; p=0·0036]; n=12), whereas no difference was seen between these outcomes for risk of HCV acquisition (1·72 [1·48–1·99; p<0·0001] for unstable housing, 1·66 [1·37–2·00; p<0·0001] for homelessness). INTERPRETATION: Homelessness and unstable housing are associated with increased risk of HIV and HCV acquisition among PWID. Our findings support the development of interventions that simultaneously address homelessness and unstable housing and HIV and HCV transmission in this population.

Considering that excessive consumption of refined salt is associated with increased incidence of gastric cancer, high blood pressure, and stroke in Koreans, consuming CGJ may be desirable, as it can be made without salt, unlike other pastes. Soybeans in CGJ are fermented by Bacillus strains (B. subtilis or B. licheniformis), Lactobacillus spp., Leuconostoc spp., and Enterococcus faecium, which weaken the activity of putrefactive bacteria in the intestines, act as antibacterial agents against pathogens, and facilitate the excretion of harmful substances. Studies on CGJ have either focused on improving product quality or evaluating the bioactive substances contained in CGJ. The fermentation process of CGJ results in the production of enzymes and various physiologically active substances that are not found in raw soybeans, including dietary fiber, phospholipids, isoflavones (e.g., genistein and daidzein), phenolic acids, saponins, trypsin inhibitors, and phytic acids. These components prevent atherosclerosis, oxidative stress-mediated heart disease and inflammation, obesity, diabetes, senile dementia, cancer (e.g., breast and lung), and osteoporosis. They have also been shown to have thrombolytic, blood pressure-lowering, lipid-lowering, antimutagenic, immunostimulatory, anti-allergic, antibacterial, anti-atopic dermatitis, anti-androgenetic alopecia, and anti-asthmatic activities, as well as skin improvement properties. In this review, we examined the physiological activities of CGJ and confirmed its potential as a functional food.","Kim, Il-Sup; Hwang, Cher-Won; Yang, Woong-Suk; Kim, Cheorl-Ho",Int J Mol Sci,22,1

These animals are also important as carriers of many pathogens with public health importance. The current systematic review was conducted to formulate a true depiction of rodent-related zoonoses in Qatar. Following systematic searches on PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science and a screening process, a total of 94 published articles were selected and studied. The studied articles reported 23 rodent-related zoonotic pathogens that include nine bacterial, eleven parasitic, and three viral pathogens, from which the frequently reported pathogens were Mycobacterium tuberculosis (32 reports), Escherichia coli (23), and Salmonella spp. (16). The possible pathway of entry of the rodent-borne pathogens can be the land port, seaports, and airport of Qatar through carrier humans and animals, contaminated food, and agricultural products. The pathogens can be conserved internally by rodents, pets, and livestock; by agricultural production systems; and by food marketing chains. The overall estimated pooled prevalence of the pathogens among the human population was 4.27% (95%CI: 4.03–4.51%; p < 0.001) with significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 99.50%). The top three highest prevalent pathogens were M. tuberculosis (30.90%; 22.75–39.04%; p < 0.001; I(2) = 99.70%) followed by Toxoplasma gondii (21.93%; 6.23–37.61%; p < 0.001; I(2) = 99.30%) and hepatitis E virus (18.29%; 11.72–24.86%; p < 0.001; I(2) = 96.70%). However, there is a knowledge gap about the listed pathogens regarding the occurrence, transmission pathways, and rodent role in transmission dynamics at the human–animal–environment interface in Qatar. Further studies are required to explore the role of rodents in spreading zoonotic pathogens through the One Health framework, consisting of zoologists, ecologists, microbiologists, entomologists, veterinarians, and public health experts in this country.","Islam, Md Mazharul; Farag, Elmoubashar; Mahmoudi, Ahmad; Hassan, Mohammad Mahmudul; Mostafavi, Ehsan; Enan, Khalid A.; Al-Romaihi, Hamad; Atta, Muzzamil; El Hussein, Abdel Rahim M.; Mkhize-Kwitshana, Zilungile",Int J Environ Res Public Health,22,1

Secondary aims were to investigate the effect of (1) the exercise prehabilitation programme on psychological health; and (2) neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) on physical fitness and psychological health. METHODS: Between October 2013 and December 2016, adults with locally advanced rectal cancer undergoing standardised NCRT and surgery were recruited to a multi-centre trial. Patients underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and completed HRQoL questionnaires (EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-5L) pre-NCRT and post-NCRT (week 0/baseline). At week 0, patients were randomised to exercise prehabilitation or usual care (no intervention). CPET and HRQoL questionnaires were assessed at week 0, 3, 6 and 9, whilst semi-structured interviews were assessed at week 0 and week 9. Changes in oxygen uptake at anaerobic threshold (VO(2) at AT (ml kg(−1) min(−1))) between groups were compared using linear mixed modelling. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were recruited, mean age 64 (10.4) years. Of the 38 patients, 33 were randomised: 16 to usual care and 17 to exercise prehabilitation (26 males and 7 females). Exercise prehabilitation significantly improved VO(2) at AT at week 9 compared to the usual care. The change from baseline to week 9, when adjusted for baseline, between the randomised groups was + 2.9 ml kg (−1) min (−1); (95% CI 0.8 to 5.1), p = 0.011. CONCLUSION: A 9-week exercise prehabilitation programme significantly improved fitness following NCRT. These findings have informed the WesFit trial (NCT03509428) which is investigating the effects of community-based multimodal prehabilitation before cancer surgery.

It is essential to identify prognostic biomarkers in patients with sepsis and ARDS. OBJECTIVE: Determine whether changes in the level of serum fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) can predict the 28-day mortality of ICU patients with sepsis and ARDS. METHODS: Consecutive sepsis patients were divided into two groups (Sepsis + ARDS and Sepsis-only), and the Sepsis + ARDS group was further classified as survivors or non-survivors. Demographic data and comorbidities were recorded. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and serum levels of cytokines and other biomarkers were recorded 3 times after admission. Multiple Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify risk factors associated with 28-day mortality in the Sepsis + ARDS group. Multivariate receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess the different predictive value of FGF21 and SOFA. RESULTS: The Sepsis + ARDS group had a greater baseline SOFA score and serum levels of cytokines and other biomarkers than the Sepsis-only group; the serum level of FGF21 was almost twofold greater in the Sepsis + ARDS group (P < 0.05). Non-survivors in the Sepsis + ARDS group had an almost fourfold greater level of FGF21 than survivors in this group (P < 0.05). The serum level of FGF21 persistently increased from the baseline to the peak of shock and death in the non-survivors, but persistently decreased in survivors (P < 0.05). Changes in the serum FGF21 level between different time points were independent risk factors for mortality. No statistical difference was observed between the AUC of FGF21 and SOFA at baseline. CONCLUSION: A large increase of serum FGF21 level from baseline is associated with 28-day mortality in ICU patients with sepsis and ARDS.

Often diagnosed at a late stage, current research efforts seek to further the molecular understanding of its aetiopathogenesis and the development of novel biomarkers. The present study investigated the expression levels of the glucogenic hormone asprosin [encoded by fibrillin-1 (FBN1)], and its cognate receptor, olfactory receptor 4M1 (OR4M1), in ovarian cancer. A blend of in silico open access The Cancer Genome Atlas data, as well as in vitro reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence data were used. RT-qPCR revealed expression levels of OR4M1 and FBN1 in clinical samples and in ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV-3, PEO1, PEO4 and MDAH-2774), as well as the normal human ovarian surface epithelial cell line (HOSEpiC). Immunohistochemical staining of a tissue microarray was used to identify the expression levels of OR4M1 and asprosin in ovarian cancer samples of varying histological subtype and grade, including clear cell carcinoma, serous ovarian cancer and mucinous adenocarcinoma. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed asprosin expression in SKOV-3 and HOSEpiC cells. These results demonstrated the expression of both asprosin and OR4M1 in normal and malignant human ovarian tissues. This research invokes further investigation to advance the understanding of the role of asprosin and OR4M1 within the ovarian tumour microenvironment.","Kerslake, Rachel; Hall, Marcia; Vagnarelli, Paola; Jeyaneethi, Jeyarooban; Randeva, Harpal S.; Pados, George; Kyrou, Ioannis; Karteris, Emmanouil",Oncol Lett,22,1

A population-based prospective study included 1443 nondiabetic subjects at baseline, and they were examined for developing T2D after 5-year follow-up. Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the hazard ratio (HR) of rs9939609 to the future T2D in the models adjusted for the confounding factors including socio-economic status, lifestyle factors (smoking and drinking history, sporting habits, and leisure time), and clinical patterns (obese status, blood pressures, and dyslipidemia) at baseline. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to measure the power to predict individuals with T2D. The FTO-rs9939609 polymorphism was a significant predictor of future T2D in the model unadjusted, and it remained significant in the final model after adjustment for the confounding factors, showing an additive effect of the A-allele (HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.02–1.78, P = 0.036, AUC = 0.676). For normoglycemic subjects at baseline, the similar final adjusted model reported the increased HR per A-allele (HR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.09–2.07, P = 0.012, AUC = 0.697). Five-year changes in BMI, waist circumference, and systolic blood pressure did not remove the contribution of rs9939609 to increased HR of T2D. The population attributable risk for risk genotype was 13.6%. In conclusion, the study indicates that the FTO-rs9939609 polymorphism is an important genetic predictor for future T2D in Vietnamese population.","Binh, Tran Quang; Linh, Duong Tuan; Chung, Le Thi Kim; Phuong, Pham Tran; Nga, Bui Thi Thuy; Ngoc, Nguyen Anh; Thuyen, Tran Quang; Tung, Do Dinh; Nhung, Bui Thi",Biochem Genet,22,17

In addition to increased susceptibility to infections and several immune-mediated manifestations, patients with CVID frequently develop bronchiectasis because of recurrent respiratory infections. This occurrence could be more likely if the diagnosis of CVID is delayed, as it often happens in less resourced clinical settings. A 15-year-old female patient was admitted to a tertiary hospital in Kazakhstan for consultation regarding a previous and established diagnosis of bronchiectasis. The clinical history was characterized by recurrent respiratory infections for several years, in addition to the development of a mixed restrictive-obstructive respiratory syndrome. Therefore, she underwent chest computerized tomography, which confirmed the presence of multiple and bilateral bronchiectasis. The clinical discussion on this patient highlighted that serum immunoglobulins were never measured previously and, thus, their assessment was strongly recommended. Based on that, a diagnosis of CVID was finally achieved, and the patient started the appropriate immunoglobulin replacement therapy. To our knowledge, this report is the first English-language publication on CVID and bronchiectasis from Central Asia. Bronchiectasis is currently an important medical problem in developing countries and populations with low socioeconomic status, where the diagnosis of the underlying cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis comorbidities can be delayed and more difficult than in countries with more accessible health care systems and facilities. This case report emphasized this important clinical issue in Central Asia and should raise the medical attention and awareness of this health problem, in order to improve the diagnostic timing and rate.","Dauyey, Zhanna; Poddighe, Dimitri",Pediatr Rep,22,1

Huge efforts have been made during recent decades in trying to improve the treatment outcomes in terms of patients’ survival, self-perception, and satisfaction. Consequently, the investigation into health-related quality of life (HRQOL) became an established and worldwide practice. Hundreds of studies tried to clarify which could be the most important variables that impact HRQOL in head and neck cancer patients. However, such a complex topic may be influenced by a multitude of interconnected aspects and several controversies were reported. In this study the current literature was reviewed to identify all those possible sources of bias that may be encountered in trying to correlate HRQOL to patient-specific or disease/treatment-specific aspects. As a result, a list of recommendations was reported to enhance the evidence of future studies. ABSTRACT: Background: health-related quality of life (HRQOL) represents a secondary endpoint of medical interventions in oncological patients. Our aim was to highlight potential sources of bias that could be encountered when evaluating HRQOL in oral cancer patients. Methods: this review followed PRISMA-ScR recommendations. Participants: patients treated for oral cancer. Concept: HRQOL assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-H&N35/QLQ-H&N43. A critical appraisal of included studies was performed to evaluate the accuracy of data stratification with respect to HRQOL determinants. Results: overall, 30 studies met the inclusion criteria, totaling 1833 patients. In total, 8 sociodemographic (SDG) and 15 disease/treatment-specific (DT) HRQOL determinants (independent variables) were identified. The mean number of the independent variables was 6.1 (SD, 4.3)—5.0 (SD, 4.0) DT-related and 1.1 (SD, 1.8) SDG-related variables per article. None of the included papers considered all the identified determinants simultaneously. Conclusions: a substantial lack of evidence regarding HRQOL determinants was demonstrated. This strongly weakens the reliability of the reported findings due to the challenging presence of baseline confounding, selection, and omitted variable biases. The proposed approach recommends the use of further evaluation tools that gather more variables in a single score together with a selection of more homogeneous, reproducible, and comparable cohorts based on the identified baseline confounding.","De Cicco, Davide; Tartaro, Gianpaolo; Ciardiello, Fortunato; Fasano, Morena; Rauso, Raffaele; Fiore, Francesca; Spuntarelli, Chiara; Troiano, Antonio; Lo Giudice, Giorgio; Colella, Giuseppe",Cancers (Basel),22,1

To address this research gap, the present study, according to social learning theory and the organism–environment interaction theory, tested whether consideration of future consequences mediated the relation between self-control and adolescent internet addiction and whether deviant peer affiliation moderated the relationship between consideration of future consequences and internet addiction. Using longitudinal tracking (two-time points and the interval is 6 months). Three middle schools in Guangzhou were randomly selected. The participants were 1182 students ranging in age from 12 to 15 years (average age: 14.16, SD = 1.29) from three middle schools in Guangzhou (651 boys and 531 girls) in Guangdong Province. Results showed that consideration of future consequences mediated the relationship between self-control and internet addiction. Furthermore, the relationship between future consequence consideration and internet addiction was moderated by deviant peer affiliation. These findings highlighted the potential mediating role of consideration of future consequences in linking self-control to adolescent internet addiction. We also found high deviant peer affiliation weakens the protective effect of future consequence consideration on Internet addiction. This study may provide support for adolescent Internet addiction prevention and have some educational implications.","Li, Jingjing; Chen, Yanhan; Lu, Jiachen; Li, Weidong; Yu, Chengfu",Int J Environ Res Public Health,22,17

In this paper, the potential role of gut hormones as potential treatments or predictors of response in depression is examined, with specific reference to the peptide hormone motilin. This possibility is explored through two methods: (1) a conceptual review of the possible links between motilin and depression, including evidence from animal and human research as well as clinical trials, based on a literature search of three scientific databases, and (2) an analysis of the relationship between a functional polymorphism (rs2281820) of the motilin (MLN) gene and cross-national variations in the prevalence of depression based on allele frequency data after correction for potential confounders. It was observed that (1) there are several plausible mechanisms, including interactions with diet, monoamine, and neuroendocrine pathways, to suggest that motilin may be relevant to the pathophysiology and treatment of depression, and (2) there was a significant correlation between rs2281820 allele frequencies and the prevalence of depression after correcting for multiple confounding factors. These results suggest that further evaluation of the utility of motilin and related gut peptides as markers of antidepressant response is required and that these molecular pathways represent potential future mechanisms for antidepressant drug development.","Rajkumar, Ravi Philip",Life (Basel),22,1

Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are antimicrobial metallic nanomaterials already used in a broad range of industrial applications. In the present study these two nanomaterials were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, zeta potential, and dynamic light scattering, and their biological properties were compared in terms of cytotoxicity, proliferation, and gene expression in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells. The results showed that both AgNPs and CNFs present similar time-dependent cytotoxicity (EC(50) of 608.1 µg/mL for CNFs and 581.9 µg/mL for AgNPs at 24 h) and similar proliferative HaCaT cell activity.

Arsenic ion in the +3 oxidation state (As(3+)) is highly toxic to cells due to its ability to bind to protein thiol groups, leading to inhibition of protein function, disruption of protein–protein interactions, and eventually to cell death. A genetically encoded biosensor for the detection of As(3+) could potentially facilitate the investigation of such toxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we designed and developed two prototype genetically encoded arsenic biosensors (GEARs), based on a bacterial As(3+) responsive transcriptional factor AfArsR from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. We constructed FRET-based GEAR biosensors by insertion of AfArsR between FP acceptor/donor FRET pairs. We further designed and engineered single FP-based GEAR biosensors by insertion of AfArsR into GFP. These constructs represent prototypes for a new family of biosensors based on the ArsR transcriptional factor scaffold. Further improvements of the GEAR biosensor family could lead to variants with suitable performance for detection of As(3+) in various biological and environmental systems.","Khan, Salma Saeed; Shen, Yi; Fatmi, Muhammad Qaiser; Campbell, Robert E.; Bokhari, Habib",Biomolecules,22,1

Despite such experiences often being inherently social, bonding and associated prosocial behaviors have rarely been empirically tested as an outcome. Here we investigate a novel measure of the mechanisms that generate altered states of consciousness during group rituals, the 4Ds: dance, drums, sleep deprivation, and drugs. We conducted a retrospective online survey examining experiences at a highly ritualized cultural phenomenon where drug use is relatively uninhibited- raves and illegal free parties. Engaging in the 4Ds at raves or free parties was associated with personal transformation for those who experienced the event as awe-inspiring, especially for people with open personalities (n = 481). Without awe, or a ritual context, indulging in the 4Ds was associated with a lack of personal growth, or anomie. A complex SEM revealed that personal transformation following awe-inspiring raves was associated with bonding to other ravers and prosocial behavior toward this group at a cost to self in a simple economic game. Bonding to humanity was not associated with these events. The findings suggest that employing the 4Ds in a ritualized environment - particularly dancing and drug use – can help build meaningful social bonds with associated positive behavioral outcomes.","Newson, Martha; Khurana, Ragini; Cazorla, Freya; van Mulukom, Valerie",Front Psychol,22,1

Blockchain technology (BT) plays a vital role in creating a platform for adequately managing the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The latest information on the blockchain and its application in solving challenging problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic are collected and discussed from the available literature searched through PubMed, Scopus, and Google scholar. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based platform to combat this pandemic. Furthermore, we have identified and discussed nine significant applications of blockchain in solving the problem arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The severity of COVID-19 was so tremendous that the World Health Organization (WHO) had to declare it as a pandemic within a month of its full-scale expansion. The greatest challenge most governments are suffering from is the lack of a precise mechanism to detect the newly infected cases and predict coronavirus infection risk. So, we need a technology-empowered solution to fight during this COVID-19 crisis. The various features of blockchain technology, such as decentralization, transparency, and immutability, can help control this pandemic by early detection of outbreaks, fast-tracking drug delivery, and protecting user privacy during treatment.","Sharma, Abhishek; Bahl, Shashi; Bagha, Ashok Kumar; Javaid, Mohd; Shukla, Dinesh Kumar; Haleem, Abid",Res,22,1

Subjects continued to present for clinical trials in Alzheimer’s disease. The purpose of this data review is to determine the effect of social isolation on orientation to time, due to site‐level concerns that the mandated social isolation may have a negative impact on orientation scores for subjects reporting mild memory concerns. METHOD: Data was collected for 68 subjects reporting mild memory concerns (not meeting diagnostic criteria for dementia). Orientation responses for 52 subjects evaluated prior to the social distancing mandate (January 1 – March 26, 2020), and 16 subjects evaluated post‐implementation of social distancing (April 1‐May22), were recorded for the following items: Year, Month, Date, Day of the Week. All subjects in the post‐implementation group reported that they were mostly staying home, and not participating in their typical social activities outside of the home. The means of the two groups were compared across all orientation domains. RESULT: A t‐test analysis reveals that following the social distancing mandate, subject performance on measures of orientation did significantly decline, overall. The mean of the pre‐social distancing group for the 4 orientation items was 3.7. The mean of the post‐social distancing group for the 4 orientation items was 3.1. (t crit = 1.67 , t stat = 2.17 , p= 0.01). Responses significantly affected by post‐social distancing were specific to Day and Date. (Correct responses for Day: 87% pre‐quarantine, 63% post‐quarantine; correct responses for Date: 90% pre‐quarantine, 69% post quarantine). Accurate Year and Month responses appeared to be consistent across both groups. CONCLUSION: Consistent with site‐level concerns that social isolation subsequent to Covid‐19 distancing guidelines could negatively impact orientation scores for subjects reporting mild memory concerns, the data collected and analyzed from January through May 2020 indicates a slight but significant decline in orientation scores post‐quarantine. Specifically, orientation to weekday and date appears to be most affected by the change in lifestyle and activities of daily living engaged in outside of the home.","Voccia, Pamela; Kruczek, Katherine; Kettren, Joy",Alzheimers Dement,22,1

Given the overwhelming number of people falling prey to this pandemic, it becomes very difficult for hospitals to provide these services within the required time. The power of Artificial Intelligence can be leveraged to solve the issue of delay in the diagnosis of coronavirus by automating the process. In this study, we propose our method, a transfer learning approach on deep convolutional neural networks to classify chest radiographs of patients as healthy or infected with Coronavirus based on the fact that Coronavirus attacks the epithelial cells of lungs resulting in pneumonia. The data used for this study has been curated from various public resources online. Our proposed model was able to achieve a validation score of 100% on the curated dataset along with high specificity and sensitivity of 1.00.

The PV system has been designed, keeping in view the required electrical load and energy available from the sun in Jordan. The actual energy consumption of the hotel is estimated (444 MWh/year) for the design and simulation of the on-grid PV system using Photovoltaic Geographical Information System software (PVGIS) and photovoltaic software (PVsyst). The results showed that PV system required 912 panels distributed over 12 inverters, with a required area of 1757.3 m(2). In addition, the on-grid PV system produced a total yearly energy of 541 MWh, with an average performance ratio of 0.828. The economic study for the proposed PV system showed that the system’s payback period was 4.1 year. Moreover, life cycle savings (LCS) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) analysis have been carried out. The LCS and LCOE of the system were found to be $51,493 and $0.0199 /kWh, respectively. Therefore, installing a proposed on-grid PV system on the Cedars hotel will save $38,718/year. It is concluded that an on-grid PV system is a technically and economically viable technology for the electrification of residential hotel applications.","Al-Zoubi, Habis; Al-Khasawneh, Yaqoub; Omar, Waid",Int J Energy Environ Eng,22,1

Consequently, web archiving is increasingly gaining attention of heritage institutions, academics and policy makers. The importance of web archives as data resources for (digital) scholars has been acknowledged for investigating the past. Still, heritage institutions and academics struggle to ‘keep up to pace’ with the fast evolving changes of the World Wide Web and with the changing habits and practices of internet users. While a number of national institutions have set up a national framework to archive ‘regular’ web pages, social media archiving (SMA) is still in its infancy with various countries starting up pilot archiving projects. SMA is not without challenges; the sheer volume of social media content, the lack of technical standards for capturing or storing social media data and social media’s ephemeral character can be impeding factors. The goal of this article is three-fold. First, we aim to extend the most recent descriptive state-of-the-art of national web archiving, published in the first issue of International Journal of Digital Humanities (March 2019) with information on SMA. Secondly, we outline the current legal, technical and operational (such as the selection and preservation policy) aspects of archiving social media content. This is complemented with results from an online survey to which 15 institutions responded. Finally, we discuss and reflect on important challenges in SMA that should be considered in future archiving projects.","Vlassenroot, Eveline; Chambers, Sally; Lieber, Sven; Michel, Alejandra; Geeraert, Friedel; Pranger, Jessica; Birkholz, Julie; Mechant, Peter",Int J Digit Humanities,22,1

While successful at the time, this rigid and inflexible management philosophy has become synonymous with cost and schedule overruns of most high-profile space missions. The software industry has recently adopted modern, more flexible project management techniques based on “lean-agile” methods that enable team collaboration and communication through distributed task and schedule management, online document sharing and rolling-wave planning. However, due to the inherent schedule complexities of hardware development and the firm constraints of design review and launch timelines, flexible project management frameworks have not been widely adopted for space mission management. This paper presents a modified version of the traditional agile management philosophy, adapted to the unique needs of the space industry. A recent satellite development project was managed using the new modified-agile approach, while collecting project hours and task durations. Comparisons were made between this new style of space project management and a recently completed satellite development project using traditional space project management techniques. Results show that the new management approach reduced strain on the project team, improved overall productivity, and maintained a more level task loading when compared to the traditional management approach. This paper also illustrates how the new management approach can enable project resilience to change by analyzing its response to the labor disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Campos, Jaime; Ferguson, Philip",AS,22,1

After the successful preparation of the dual layer PVA patch, the prepared patch was subjected to investigation to assess the effect of freeze-thaw cycles, nanofiber thickness and percentages of DS loading on the morphology, physiochemical and mechanical properties. Various spectroscopic techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), water contact angle, and tensile tests were used to evaluate the physicochemical and mechanical properties of prepared dual layer PVA patches. The morphological structures of the dual layer PVA patch demonstrated the effectiveness of both techniques. The effect of freeze-thaw cycles, nanofiber thickness, and DS percentage loading on the crystallinity of a dual layer PVA patch was investigated using XRD analysis. The presence of a distinct DS peak in the FTIR spectrum indicates the compatibility of DS in a dual layer PVA patch through in-situ loading. All prepared patches were considered highly hydrophilic because the data obtained was less than 90°. The increasing saturation of DS within the PVA matrix increases the tensile strength of prepared patches, however decreased its elasticity. Evidently, the increasing of electrospun PVA nanofibers thickness, freeze-thaw cycles, and the DS saturation has improved the physicochemical and mechanical properties of the DS medicated dual layer PVA patches, making them a promising biomaterial for transdermal drug delivery applications.","Sa’adon, Shafizah; Ansari, Mohamed Nainar Mohamed; Razak, Saiful Izwan Abd; Anand, Joseph Sahaya; Nayan, Nadirul Hasraf Mat; Ismail, Al Emran; Khan, Muhammad Umar Aslam; Haider, Adnan",Polymers (Basel),22,0

However, while the positive impact of technology on insurance companies’ efficiency is expected, literature assessing it empirically is scarce, when it comes to recent technological change. Focusing on the US public P&C insurance sector in the period 2012–2018 and relying on both nonparametric (two stage DEA) and parametric (SFA) approaches, it emerges that on average insurance companies were not able to leverage on technological innovations to improve their efficiency. On average a relative level of efficiency among companies, according to a two stage DEA model, was quite stable in time, while the SFA approach shows that the distance between efficient and less efficient firms slightly increased. Moreover, we found one very efficient firm, almost a leader of the market in terms of efficiency, and a homogeneous group of followers, indicating that there is vast scope for improvement for less efficient companies. Nevertheless, even the most efficient company impaired its efficiency over time, suggesting that neither the leader nor on average the followers properly leveraged technology to improve their efficiency. In a competitive scenario, with new players’ entrance and fierce competition, inertia may seriously affect their positioning. Academicians, managers and policymakers should carefully consider the effects that a non-improvement of efficiency following technological change may have on market structure, competition and regulations, potentially opening to further discussion on how technological innovations adoption should be facilitated.","Lanfranchi, Davide; Grassi, Laura",Eurasian Bus Rev,22,1

Moreover, when nodules remain adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract or gallbladder, severe complications such as perforation of those organs may occur due to invasive therapy. Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) with artificial ascites or laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation (LRFA) are used to treat these patients to avoid complications. The purpose of the present study was to assess the efficacy and safety of these two methods. METHODS Subjects comprised 74 patients (48 men, 26 women; mean age, 68.5 +/- 8.0 years; range, 46-89 years) with 86 HCC nodules. PRFA with artificial ascites was carried out for 37 patients (44 nodules) and LRFA was used for 37 patients (42 nodules). Clinical profiles were compared between groups. RESULTS No significant differences in clinical profiles were found between patients treated by PRFA or LRFA. Mean number of treatments was significantly lower for LRFA (1.0 +/- 0.0) than for PRFA (2.1 +/- 1.0, P < 0.001). Mean number of PRFA treatments was 2.2 +/- 1.0 in patients with HCC nodules >2 cm in diameter, whereas all tumors were completely ablated with only one session of LRFA. The safety margin was significantly wider for LRFA than for PRFA. CONCLUSION LRFA is a better treatment option for ablation of HCC nodules >2.0 cm in diameter.","Hirooka, Masashi; Kisaka, Yoshiyasu; Uehara, Takahide; Ishida, Kiyotaka; Kumagi, Teru; Watanabe, Yuji; Abe, Masanori; Matsuura, Bunzo; Hiasa, Yoichi; Onji, Morikazu",Digestive endoscopy : official journal of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society,22,1

Accelerated aging, loss of epithelial progenitor cell function and/or numbers and cellular senescence are implicated in the pathogenies of IPF. OBJECTIVES We sought to investigate the role of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells cellular senescence in initiation and/or progression of pulmonary fibrosis and therapeutic potential of targeting senescence related pathways and senescent cells. METHODS Epithelial cells of 9 control donor proximal and distal lung tissues and 11 IPF fibrotic lung tissues were profiled by single cell RNAseq to assesses the contribution of epithelial cells to the senescent cell fraction for IPF. A novel mouse model of conditional AT2 cell senescence was generated to study role of cellular senescence in pulmonary fibrosis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We show that alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells isolated from IPF lung tissue exhibit characteristic transcriptomic features of cellular senescence. We used conditional loss of Sin3a in adult mouse AT2 cells to initiate a program of p53-dependent cellular senescence, AT2 cell depletion, and spontaneous, progressive pulmonary fibrosis. We establish that senescence rather than loss of AT2 cells promotes progressive fibrosis and show that either genetic or pharmacologic interventions targeting p53 activation or senescence block fibrogenesis. CONCLUSIONS Senescence of AT2 cells is sufficient to drive progressive pulmonary fibrosis. Early attenuation of senescence-related pathways and elimination of senescent cells are promising therapeutic approachs to prevent pulmonary fibrosis.","Yao, Changfu; Guan, Xiangrong; Carraro, Gianni; Parimon, Tanyalak; Liu, Xue; Huang, Guanling; Mulay, Apoorva; Soukiasian, Harmik J; David, Gregory; Weigt, Stephen S; Belperio, John A; Chen, Peter; Jiang, Dianhua; Noble, Paul W; Stripp, Barry R",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,22,9

In particular, lower RTIs are a leading cause of hospitalization and mortality. Timely detection of the infecting respiratory pathogens is crucial to optimize treatment and care. In this study, three U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved molecular multiplex platforms (Prodesse ProFLU+/FAST+, FilmArray RP, and Verigene RV+) were evaluated for influenza virus detection in 171 clinical samples collected during the Belgian 2011-2012 influenza season. Sampling was done using mid-turbinate flocked swabs, and the collected samples were stored in universal transport medium. The amount of viral RNA present in the swab samples ranged between 3.07 and 8.82 log10 copies/ml. Sixty samples were concordant influenza A virus positive, and 8 samples were found to be concordant influenza B virus positive. Other respiratory viruses that were detected included human rhinovirus/enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, human metapneumovirus, and coronavirus NL63. Twenty-five samples yielded discordant results across the various assays which required further characterization by sequencing. The FilmArray RP and Prodesse ProFLU+/FAST+ assays were convenient to perform with regard to sensitivity, ease of use, and low percentages of invalid results. Although the limit of sensitivity is of utmost importance, many other factors should be taken into account in selecting the most convenient molecular diagnostic assay for the detection of respiratory pathogens in clinical samples.","Van Wesenbeeck, Liesbeth; Meeuws, Hanne; Van Immerseel, Andrea; Ispas, Gabriela; Schmidt, Kristiane; Houspie, Lieselot; Van Ranst, Marc; Stuyver, Lieven",Journal of clinical microbiology,22,17

The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on urology surgical waiting list in a high-volume hospital. Methods An observational descriptive study was designed. All patients included in the urology surgical waiting list of our high-volume center on May 1st 2020 (46 days after the suspension of elective surgery) were analyzed. Baseline variables, priority on the waiting list, main urological disease, type of scheduled surgery, and waiting time were recorded. Other variables recorded were the presence of a urinary catheter, number of accesses to the emergency department, evidence of COVID-19 infection, number of deaths and their cause. The waiting time for each disease was compared with the time to surgery in 2019. Results A total of 350 patients were included. The mean (SD) time on the waiting list was 97.33 (55.47) days. Priority 1 patients, who normally should undergo surgery within 30 days, were on the waiting list for a mean (SD) time of 60.51 (20.14) days. They were mainly patients with ureteral lithiasis (25.6%), high-risk or muscle-invasive bladder cancer (20.9%) and high-risk prostate cancer (13.9%). The mean waiting time had already significantly exceeded the mean time to surgery in 2019 for radical cystectomy (p = 0.04) and URS (p = 0.003).

This procedure is increasingly performed with endoscopic techniques (laparoscopy). Many surgeons prefer to cover the hernia gap with a mesh to prevent recurrence. The mesh must be fixed tightly, but without tension. During laparoscopic surgery, the mesh is generally fixed with staples or tissue glue. However, staples often cause pain at the staple sites, and they can cause scarring of the abdominal wall, which can lead to chronic pain. We designed a trial that aims to determine whether mesh fixation with glue might cause less postoperative pain than fixation with staples during a transabdominal preperitoneal patch plastic repair. METHODS/DESIGN The TISTA trial is a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-center trial with a two-by-two parallel design. All patients and outcome-assessors will be blinded to treatment allocations. For eligibility, patients must be male, ≥18 years old, and scheduled for laparoscopic repair of a primary inguinal hernia. One group comprises patients with a unilateral inguinal hernia that will be randomized to receive mesh fixation with either tissue glue or staples. The second group comprises patients with bilateral inguinal hernias. They will be randomized to receive mesh fixation with tissue glue either on the right or the left side and with staples on the other side. The primary endpoint will be pain under physical stress, measured at 24 h after surgery. Pain will be rated by the patient based on a numeric rating scale from 0 to 10, where 10 equals the worst pain imaginable. A total of 82 patients will be recruited (58 patients with unilateral inguinal hernias and 24 patients with bilateral hernias). This number is estimated to provide 90% power for detecting a pain reduction of one point on a numeric rating scale, with a standard deviation of one. DISCUSSION Patients with bilateral hernias will receive two meshes, one fixed with glue, and the other fixed with staples. This design will eliminate the inter-individual bias inherent in comparing pain measurements between two groups of patients.

LND serves an indisputable staging role by providing pathologic nodal stage. However, while earlier observational studies had suggested a survival benefit to LND, more recent observational evidence and a randomized trial do not support a survival benefit. The majority of patients with isolated lymph node involvement appear to harbor occult metastatic disease. Still, LND is not associated with increased perioperative morbidity when performed in experienced centers.

Unlike endoscopy, where standardized scoring for evaluation of disease activity is widely used, scoring for UC with IUS is currently unavailable. Therefore, we conducted a study to assess reliability of IUS in UC among expert sonographists in order to identify robust parameters. METHODS Thirty patients with both clinically active (25) and quiescent (5) UC were included. Six expert sonographers first agreed upon key IUS parameters and grading including bowel wall thickness (BWT), Color Doppler Signal (CDS), inflammatory fat (i-fat), loss of bowel wall stratification (BWS), loss of haustrations and presence of lymph nodes. Thirty video-recorded cases were blindly reviewed. RESULTS Inter-observer agreement was almost perfect for BWT (ICC: 0.96) and substantial for CDS (κ=0.63). Agreement was moderate for presence of lymph nodes (κ=0.41) and fair for presence of i-fat (κ=0.36), BWS (κ=0.24) and loss of haustrations (κ=0.26). Furthermore, there was substantial agreement for presence of disease activity on IUS (κ=0.77) and almost perfect agreement for disease severity (ICC: 0.93). Most individual parameters showed strong association with IUS disease activity as measured by the 6 readers. CONCLUSION IUS is a reliable imaging modality to assess disease activity and severity in UC. Important individual parameters like BWT and CDS are reliable and could be incorporated in a future UC scoring index. Standardized acquisition and assessment of UC utilizing IUS with established reliability is important to expand the use of IUS globally.","De Voogd, Floris; Wilkens, Rune; Gecse, Krisztina; Allocca, Mariangela; Novak, Kerri; Lu, Cathy; D'Haens, Geert; Maaser, Christian",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,22,31

The aims of this study were to assess differences in perioperative outcomes between laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomies (LLLS) performed in supine position and LPSS in semiprone position. METHODS We reviewed our prospectively collected database of all liver resections performed between January 2012 and January 2015. LLLS and LPSS were compared with respect to demographics and perioperative outcomes. RESULTS Forty-five patients underwent LLLS (n = 20) or LPSS (n = 25). There were no differences in patient demographics or tumor diameter (p = 0.946). There were no conversions. Pringle maneuver was not used in both groups. There was no difference in peroperative central venous pressure (p = 0.511). The median operative time in the LLLS group was 100 min (60-260) and 160 min (95-270) in the LPSS group (p = 0.002) with median intraoperative blood loss in the LLLS group of 50 ml (0-550) versus a larger 150 ml (50-700) (p = 0.010) for patients receiving LPSS. No patients required transfusion. Intraoperative and postoperative complication rates were similar in both groups. Median hospital stay was 6 days in both groups (p = 0.554). CONCLUSION LPSS in semiprone can be performed with similar clinical outcomes as a minor laparoscopic liver resection except for longer operative time and larger intraoperative blood loss without the need for transfusion.,"D'Hondt, Mathieu; Yoshihara, Emi; Vansteenkiste, Franky; Steelant, Pieter Jan; Van Ooteghem, Barbara; Pottel, Hans; Devriendt, Dirk; Van Rooy, Frank",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,22,1

The moratorium is industry self-regulated and applies only to policies below certain financial limits (eg, $500 000 of death cover). METHODS We surveyed Australian health professionals (HPs) who discuss genetic testing with patients, to assess knowledge of the moratorium; reported patient experiences since its commencement; and HP views regarding regulation of genetic discrimination (GD) in Australia. RESULTS Between April and June 2020, 166 eligible HPs responded to the online survey. Of these, 86% were aware of the moratorium, but <50% had attended related training/information sessions. Only 16% answered all knowledge questions correctly, yet 69% believed they had sufficient knowledge to advise patients. Genetics HPs' awareness and knowledge were better than non-genetics HPs' (p<0.05). There was some reported decrease in patients delaying/declining testing after the moratorium's introduction, however, 42% of HPs disagreed that patients were more willing to have testing post-moratorium. Although many (76%) felt the moratorium resolved some GD concerns, most (88%) still have concerns, primarily around self-regulation, financial limits and the moratorium's temporary nature. Almost half (49%) of HPs reported being dissatisfied with the moratorium as a solution to GD. The majority (95%) felt government oversight is required, and 93% felt specific Australian legislation regarding GD is required. CONCLUSION While the current Australian moratorium is considered a step forward, most HPs believe it falls short of an adequate long-term regulatory solution to GD in life insurance.","Tiller, Jane M; Keogh, Louise A; McInerney-Leo, Aideen M; Belcher, Andrea; Barlow-Stewart, Kristine; Boughtwood, Tiffany; Gleeson, Penny; Dowling, Grace; Prince, Anya; Bombard, Yvonne; Joly, Yann; Delatycki, Martin; Winship, Ingrid M; Otlowski, Margaret; Lacaze, Paul",Journal of medical genetics,22,31

Published reports document low concentrations of mononuclear cells leftover in fresh-frozen plasma products, however the phenotype and the proliferative potential of these cells has not been tested. MATERIALS AND METHODS We investigated residual cellular components contained within fresh and fresh-frozen plasma products and characterised their proliferative potential in co-cultures with unrelated allogeneic cells. We designed a flow-based assay to phenotype cells and quantify cell division by measuring the dilution of fluorescently labeled protein as cells divide. Leukocytes from consenting donors were purified from fresh liquid or fresh-frozen plasma units and cultured for three to seven days with unrelated irradiated allogeneic targets. RESULTS We discovered a median of 1.6×107 viable lymphocytes were detectable in fresh plasma units after collection (n=8), comprised of a mixture of CD3+ CD8+ and CD3+ CD4+ cells. Furthermore, we identified a median of 8.4% of live CD3+ plasma lymphocytes divided as early as Day 4 when co-cultured with unrelated allogeneic cells, expanding to a median 88.8% by Day 7 (n=3). Although freezing the plasma product reduced the total number of viable leukocyte cells down to 2.3×105 (n=10), residual naive CD3+ cells were viable and demonstrated division through Day 7 of co-culture. DISCUSSION The evidence of viable proliferative lymphocytes in fresh and fresh-frozen plasma products derived from centrifugation suggests that additional leukoreduction measures should be investigated to fully eradicate reactive lymphocytes from centrifuged plasma products.","Lazarski, Christopher A; Toner, Keri; Keller, Michael D; Luban, Naomi; Young, Pampee P; Bollard, Catherine M; Wagner, Stephen J; Hanley, Patrick J",Blood transfusion = Trasfusione del sangue,22,1

In this study we aimed to evaluate the discriminative ability of hematologic, biochemical and immunologic biomarkers in patients with and without the severe or fatal forms of COVID-19. Methods An electronic search in Medline (PubMed interface), Scopus, Web of Science and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) was performed, to identify studies reporting on laboratory abnormalities in patients with COVID-19. Studies were divided into two separate cohorts for analysis: severity (severe vs. non-severe and mortality, i.e. non-survivors vs. survivors). Data was pooled into a meta-analysis to estimate weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each laboratory parameter. Results A total number of 21 studies was included, totaling 3377 patients and 33 laboratory parameters. While 18 studies (n = 2984) compared laboratory findings between patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19, the other three (n = 393) compared survivors and non-survivors of the disease and were thus analyzed separately. Patients with severe and fatal disease had significantly increased white blood cell (WBC) count, and decreased lymphocyte and platelet counts compared to non-severe disease and survivors. Biomarkers of inflammation, cardiac and muscle injury, liver and kidney function and coagulation measures were also significantly elevated in patients with both severe and fatal COVID-19. Interleukins 6 (IL-6) and 10 (IL-10) and serum ferritin were strong discriminators for severe disease. Conclusions Several biomarkers which may potentially aid in risk stratification models for predicting severe and fatal COVID-19 were identified. In hospitalized patients with respiratory distress, we recommend clinicians closely monitor WBC count, lymphocyte count, platelet count, IL-6 and serum ferritin as markers for potential progression to critical illness.","Henry, Brandon Michael; de Oliveira, Maria Helena Santos; Benoit, Stefanie; Plebani, Mario; Lippi, Giuseppe",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,22,27

Widespread vaccination is still uncertain, so many scientific efforts have been directed toward discovering antiviral treatments. Many drugs are being investigated to inhibit the coronavirus main protease, 3CLpro, from cleaving its viral polyprotein, but few publications have addressed this protease’s interactions with the host proteome or their probable contribution to virulence. Too few host protein cleavages have been experimentally verified to fully understand 3CLpro’s global effects on relevant cellular pathways and tissues. Here, I set out to determine this protease’s targets and corresponding potential drug targets. Using a neural network trained on cleavages from 388 coronavirus proteomes with a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.983, I predict that a large proportion of the human proteome is vulnerable to 3CLpro, with 4,460 out of approximately 20,000 human proteins containing at least one putative cleavage site. These cleavages are nonrandomly distributed and are enriched in the epithelium along the respiratory tract, brain, testis, plasma, and immune tissues and depleted in olfactory and gustatory receptors despite the prevalence of anosmia and ageusia in COVID-19 patients. Affected cellular pathways include cytoskeleton/motor/cell adhesion proteins, nuclear condensation and other epigenetics, host transcription and RNAi, ribosomal stoichiometry and nascent-chain detection and degradation, coagulation, pattern recognition receptors, growth factors, lipoproteins, redox, ubiquitination, and apoptosis.

Organizations’ HR functions around the world have been working hard to effect a response that falls under four main headings: jobs and work continuity;physical health and well-being;need for mental health, resilience, family support and dealing with uncertainty;and remote work. Knowledge of whether and how these responses have been adopted by health organizations or their potential impact is scarce.Design/methodology/approachThis paper discusses some of the HR strategies adopted or recommended for adoption by health systems/organizations with specific reference to the aforementioned HR response categories.FindingsThe evidence available illustrates that the HR responses adopted by health organizations are mostly in line with those adopted by organizations from other sectors, though not without some variances. The findings also suggest that COVID has acted as a “technological catalyst” for HR practices in health organizations.Research limitations/implicationsThe background readings that informed this study also helped to identify some literature gaps that could be addressed by future research and practice.Practical implicationsThe state of the art presented in this paper may be of value to health leaders and health HR managers in further strengthening their responses to both pre-existing and post-COVID people-related challenges.Originality/valueThis work is timely considering existing literature gaps and the fact that the existing evidence gets outdated quickly as the emergency progresses.","Tursunbayeva, Aizhan",Strategic HR Review,22,20

The modified CLES, called CLES-FS, was developed explicitly for Fijian students in the New Zealand secondary schooling context. The adapted CLES-FS instrument included five components of constructivist learning: relationship and identity, familiar context, talanoa, critical voice and shared control. The inclusion of talanoa within the CLES-survey tool has not been done before to collect data from iTaukei (Indigenous) and Fijian-Indian students. The implication of using talanoa alongside CLES-FS has provided the unfolding of possibilities when weaving together qualitative as well as quantitative data.

Even when all of other DL hyper-parameters are accurate, the selected architecture will define the final classification quality of the generated model. In our previous paper we described a unique classification methodology called ACKEM for efficient and automatic classification of data, based on an ensemble of multiple DL models and KNN input-based architecture selection. The ACKEM methodology does not restrict the classification to one specific model with one specific architecture, as a specific architecture might not fit some of the input data. The ACKEM methodology had a major constraint – it used a brute-force approach for selecting the most suitable K for its inner usage of the KNN algorithm. In this paper, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach, for selecting the most suitable K. This method was tested over multiple datasets including the Covid-19 Radiography Chest X-Ray Images Dataset, the Malaria Cells Dataset, the Road Potholes Dataset, and the Voice Commands Dataset. All the tested datasets served us in our previous work on ACKEM, as well. This paper proves that replacing the inefficient method of brute force with a GA approach can improve the ACKEM method’s complexity without harming its promising results. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Zagagy, B.; Herman, M.; Levi, O.","Computing Conference, 2021",22,28

This infection is primarily transmitted via virus-laden fluid particles (i.e., droplets and aerosols) that are formed in the respiratory tract of infected individuals and expelled from the mouth in the course of breathing, talking, coughing, and sneezing. To mitigate the risk of virus transmission, in many places of the world, the public has been asked or even obliged to use face covers. It is plausible that in the years ahead we will see the use of face masks, face shields and respirators become a normal practice in our life. However, wearing face covers is uncomfortable in some situations, like, for example, in summer heat, while staying on beaches or at hotel swimming pools, doing exercises in gyms, etc. Also, most types of face cover become contaminated with time and need to be periodically replaced or disinfected. These nuisances are caused by the fact that face covers are based on material barriers, which prevent inward and outward propagation of aerosol and droplets containing the pathogen. Applying well established gas-particle flow formalism, we study a non-material based protection barrier created by a flow of well directed down stream of air across the front of the open face. The~protection is driven by dragging virus-laden particles inside the width of the air flow and hence, as a consequence, displacing them away from their primary trajectories. The study, shows that such, potentially portable, air curtains can effectively provide both inward and outward protection and serve as an effective personal protective equipment (PPE) mitigating human to human transmission of virus infection like COVID-19.","Sakharov, Alexander S.; Zhukov, Konstantin",,22,16

The objective of this study was to explore these repercussions and assess perceived barriers imposed by the pandemic on medical students applying to residency in 2020. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of all applicants invited and choosing to interview at a single emergency medicine residency. Applicants answered a standardized question (“what were the biggest barriers to you this year as a result of COVID, whether personally or professionally?”) which was asked by one of two faculty members who, between them, interviewed 100% of applicants at the residency program. Faculty members entered applicant responses into a standardized Excel spreadsheet and deidentified the data. Data was then reviewed and categorized by trained, blinded investigators using grounded theory methodology. Data reviewers were not involved in the interview process, nor were they involved in candidate selection. Basic demographic information was obtained, including geographic region of medical school and sex. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Fisher Exact. The study was reviewed by the IRB and found to be exempt. Results: Over 900 applications were received, and 199 applicants interviewed for positions in the residency program. Applicants were chosen through routine methods, and this study had no impact on candidate selection. 32.2% of interviewees were female, 67.3% were male, and 1 was not recorded. In terms of impact on their professional lives, over a third of students felt that their education had lagged as a result of the pandemic (36.7%), and 22.1% expressed concern for inability to perform at their audition rotations. In their personal lives, the biggest impacts of COVID-19 were feelings of isolation (36.3%), feelings of frustration and helplessness (9%), concerns about personal safety (4.5%), and general fear and worry (4%). Male and female applicants responded similarly in all categories except in feelings of frustration and helplessness, in which female applicants were much more likely to express those feelings than male applicants (18.8% vs. 4.5%, p=0.002). Conclusions: Medical students applying to residency perceive significant personal and professional disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The most common personal barrier reported was isolation, while impact on education was the biggest professional concern.

We compared health-related quality of life scores estimated by the EQ5D-3L questionnaire between these two groups after adjusting basic characteristics of the participants by propensity score matching. Results 349 participants reported no symptoms and 108 reported any symptoms at the time of the survey. The participants who reported any symptoms showed a lower value on a Visual Analogue Scale (median 70 [IQR 60-80]) and on the EQ-5D-3L (median 0.81 [IQR 0.77-1.0]) than those reporting no symptoms (median 85 [IQR 75-90] and 1.0 [IQR 1.0-1.0], respectively).

Here, we report a novel excitatory circuit from a subpopulation of the ventral hippocampus CA1 subfield (vCA1) to the inhibitory peri-paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (pPVN) which then routes to the periaqueductal grey (PAG). We find that vCA1→pPVN projections modulate both learned and innate fear. Fiber photometric calcium recordings reveal that activity in vCA1→pPVN projections increases during the first moments of exposure to an unconditioned threat. Chemogenetic or optogenetic silencing of vCA1→pPVN cell bodies or vCA1→pPVN axon terminals in the pPVN enhances the initial magnitude of both active and passive unconditioned defensive responses, irrespective of the sensory modalities engaged by a particular innate threat. Moreover, silencing produces a dramatic impact on learned fear without affecting milder anxiety-like behaviors. We also show that vCA1→pPVN projections monosynaptically route to the PAG, a key brain region that orchestrates the fear response. Surprisingly, optogenetic silencing of vCA1 terminals in the pPVN titrates the level of c-Fos neural activity in the PAG differently for learned versus innate threats. Together, our results show how a novel vCA1→pPVN circuit modulates neuronal activity in the PAG to regulate both learned and innate fear. These findings have implications for how initial trauma processing may influence maladaptive defensive behaviors across fear and trauma-related disorders.

Regarding the health system, hospitals all over the world have been going through, among so many challenges, shortage of resources that could, if available, help them on the fight against COVID-19, and even save the lives of their patients. This review paper aims to offer for both healthcare providers and patients, better conditions when fighting the disease, regarding the actual primary care shortage, and addressing a splitting valve concept coupled to the mechanical ventilators in the most severe cases. The automated valve development with a monitoring and analysis system for pulmonary mechanics will stablish the database parameters of patients with COVid-19 and SARS, in order to assist the medical team in the treatment of diseases and the average evolution of the clinical condition of patients at an early stage, contributing to a reduction in the time of hospitalization and treatment and mortality. These information is saved on a database shared with other hospitals, allowing a search for matching patients;with similar or same pulmonary compliance, gender, height, weight, respiratory frequency and, in most severe cases when the patient needs mechanical ventilation, the availability of the nearest treatment is verified viewing immediate care. Regarding the mechanical ventilator device usage, the automated valve views engaged to a human-machine interface from the systems hardware allows the treatment of multiple patients, under the same ventilator, in an individualized way. To achieve that, pressure transducers and controllers of flow and temperature will continuously monitor the adequate flow of air and pressure to each patient that are under the same ventilator. Moreover, when monitoring each patient among the health units and hospitals integrated to the system, the medical team is helped defining the best strategy to the treatment stage and, by these means, the use of mechanical ventilator by the CoVID-19 patient is amplified, allowing to attend more than one patient who will need mechanical ventilation with SARS an accuracy treatment and monitoring method.","da Silva, A.

In low-income countries, there's a shortage of pricy respiratory devices resulting in exceeding the provision of taking care of Covid-19's patients in ICU. This paper attempts to design and implement an appropriate respiratory device referred to as a bag valve mask (BVM) ventilator for those who are Covid-19 patients in medical care, those patients have a requirement of safe transport and also palliative care. The BVM ventilator comprises a man-made manual breath unit (AMBU) bag and paddles for squeezing the AMBU bag which is popular in medical aid settings. The BVM ventilator is required to travel airflow through the system to the patient's lung with the specified volume for every breath cycle within a threshold air pressure. Since the AMBU bag is straightforward to be deformed over time, it's difficult to get mathematical modelling for constructing a reliable controller. Therefore, a model-free control (MFC) control approach is utilized successfully to style a controller for our BVM ventilator model with a PEEP valve and a HEPA filter. Some experimental scenarios are administered to gauge the effectiveness of the proposed controller for the BVM ventilator to control the airflow and control air pressure mode.","Truong, C.

Previous studies have identified two important RNA signals for frameshifting, the slippery sequence and a downstream stem–loop structure. However, there have been somewhat conflicting reports concerning the individual contributions of these sequences. In this study we have performed a comprehensive mutational analysis of the cis-acting RNA sequences involved in HIV-1 gag–pol and HTLV-2 gag–pro frameshifting. Using an in vitro translation system we determined frameshifting efficiencies for shuffled HIV-1/HTLV-2 RNA elements in a background of HIV-1 or HTLV-2 sequences. We show that the ability of the slippery sequence and stem–loop to promote ribosomal frameshifting is influenced by the flanking upstream sequence and the nucleotides in the spacer element. A wide range of frameshift efficiency rates was observed for both viruses when shuffling single sequence elements. The results for HIV-1/HTLV-2 chimeric constructs represent strong evidence supporting the notion that the viral wild-type sequences are not designed for maximal frameshifting activity but are optimized to a level suited to efficient viral replication.","Kim, Yang-Gyun; Maas, Stefan; Rich, Alexander",,22,1

We sought to assess the burden of metal health dysfunction among emergency department (ED) patients presenting for care three years post-war in Serbia. METHODS This study was conducted during July and August 2002 at two sites: a university hospital ED in Belgrade, Serbia and an ED in a remote district hospital serving a Serbian enclave in Laplje Selo, Kosovo. Investigators collected data on a systematic sample of non-acute patients presenting to the ED. All respondents completed a structured questionnaire assessing demographics and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire), and major depression (using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale). RESULTS A total of 562 respondents participated (310 in Belgrade, 252 in Laplje Selo); the response rate was 83.8%, 43% were female, and mean age was 37.6 years (SD = 13.4). Overall, 73 (13.0%) participants had symptoms consistent with PTSD, and 272 (49.2%) had symptoms consistent with depression. Sixty-six respondents had both disorders (11.9%). In separate multivariable logistic regression models, predictors of PTSD were refugee status and residence in Laplje Selo, and predictors of depression were older age, current unemployment, and lower social support. CONCLUSIONS Three years post-war, symptoms of PTSD and major depression in Serbia remained a significant public health concern, particularly among refugees, those suffering subsequent economic instability, and persons living in rural, remote areas.","Nelson, Brett D; Fernandez, William G; Galea, Sandro; Sisco, Sarah; Dierberg, Kerry; Gorgieva, Gordana Subaric; Nandi, Arijit K; Ahern, Jennifer; Mitrović, Mihajlo; VanRooyen, Michael; Vlahov, David",BMC medicine,22,8

Bariatric surgery offers morbidly obese individuals substantial and sustainable weight loss and reduction in obesity-related comorbidities. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a new restrictive procedure in bariatric surgery. We aimed to evaluate our experience with LSG with regard to its safety and feasibility and early weight loss. METHODS The surgical outcome, complications and early clinical results of all patients who underwent LSG at Singapore General Hospital were studied. RESULTS 30 patients underwent LSG between December 2008 and October 2010. The mean preoperative weight of the patients was 113.4 (range 91.0-170.0) kg, while the mean body mass index (BMI) was 42.6 (range 33.0-60.0) kg/m². Diabetes mellitus was present in 39 percent of the patients, hypertension in 43 percent, hyperlipidaemia in 35 percent, obstructive sleep apnoea in 30 percent and osteoarthritis in 22 percent. The majority of patients had two or more obesity-related comorbidities (52 percent). Mean operative time was 142 (range 80-220) minutes and median duration of postoperative stay was three days. At two weeks, one, three and six months post operation, the mean BMI was 38.6 kg/m², 37.8 kg/m², 34.5 kg/m² and 30.8 kg/m², the mean percentage of excess weight loss was 17.7 percent, 23.3 percent, 40.9 percent and 56.7 percent, and absolute weight loss was 8.00 kg, 11.52 kg, 18.77 kg and 26.85 kg, respectively. CONCLUSION LSG is a promising procedure for surgical treatment of obesity, with good early weight loss and low morbidity.","Lee, S Y; Lim, C H; Pasupathy, S; Poopalalingam, R; Tham, K W; Ganguly, S; Wai, C H D; Wong, W K",Singapore medical journal,22,16

The isolation of the PEDV was successful only in Vero cells maintained in the maintenance medium (MM) containing trypsin. Infected Vero cell cultures exhibited CPE characterized by cell-fusion and syncytial formation, as well as cytoplasmic fluorescence when examined by the indirect immunofluorescent test using rabbit anti-83P-5 virus serum. The isolate was adapted to serial propagation in Vero cell cultures by adding trypsin to MM. Vero cell-adapted PEDV was successfully propagated in the MA104, CPK and ESK cell lines in the presence of trypsin in MM. Vero cell-adapted PEDV had morphologic and physicochemical characteristics similar to those of other members of the coronaviridae. The isolate differed serologically from porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis viruses, and no antigenic relationship between the isolate and TGE virus could be detected by the indirect immunofluorescent test. Attempts to isolate PEDV in 6 types of primary fetal pig cell cultures and 6 of 10 established cell lines resulted in the failure, probably because these cells were damaged by the action of trypsin.","Kusanagi, K; Kuwahara, H; Katoh, T; Nunoya, T; Ishikawa, Y; Samejima, T; Tajima, M",The Journal of veterinary medical science,22,19

OBJECTIVE This study assesses if PCR amplification improves virus and bacteria detection, and if viral infection contributes to mortality in severe CAP in a tropical setting, where respiratory pathogens have less well-defined seasonality. METHODS In this cohort study of patients with severe CAP in an intensive care unit, endotracheal aspirates for intubated patients and nasopharyngeal swabs for non-intubated patients were sent for PCR amplification for respiratory viruses. Blood, endotracheal aspirates for intubated patients, and sputum for non-intubated patients were analysed using a multiplex PCR system for bacteria. RESULTS Out of 100 patients, using predominantly cultures, bacteria were identified in 42 patients; PCR amplification increased this number to 55 patients. PCR amplification identified viruses in 32 patients. In total, only bacteria, only viruses, and both bacteria and viruses were found in 37, 14, and 18 patients, respectively. The commonest viruses were influenza A H1N1/2009 and rhinovirus; the commonest bacterium was Streptococcus pneumoniae. Hospital mortality rates for patients with no pathogens, bacterial infection, viral infection, and bacterial-viral co-infection were 16.1, 24.3, 0, and 5.6%, respectively (p = 0.10). On multivariable analysis, virus detection was associated with lower mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0.12, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.99; p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS Viruses and bacteria were detected in 7 of 10 patients with severe CAP with the aid of PCR amplification. Viral infection appears to be independently associated with lower mortality.","Siow, Wen Ting; Koay, Evelyn Siew-Chuan; Lee, Chun Kiat; Lee, Hong Kai; Ong, Venetia; Ngerng, Wang Jee; Lim, Hui Fang; Tan, Adeline; Tang, Julian Wei-Tze; Phua, Jason",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,22,11

We have used several strains of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) in cell culture and in vivo in mouse models to investigate the antiviral characteristics of peptide-conjugated antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (P-PMOs). Ten P-PMOs directed against various target sites in the viral genome were tested in cell culture, and one of these (5TERM), which was complementary to the 5' terminus of the genomic RNA, was effective against six strains of MHV. Further studies were carried out with various arginine-rich peptides conjugated to the 5TERM PMO sequence in order to evaluate efficacy and toxicity and thereby select candidates for in vivo testing. In uninfected mice, prolonged P-PMO treatment did not result in weight loss or detectable histopathologic changes. 5TERM P-PMO treatment reduced viral titers in target organs and protected mice against virus-induced tissue damage. Prophylactic 5TERM P-PMO treatment decreased the amount of weight loss associated with infection under most experimental conditions. Treatment also prolonged survival in two lethal challenge models. In some cases of high-dose viral inoculation followed by delayed treatment, 5TERM P-PMO treatment was not protective and increased morbidity in the treated group, suggesting that P-PMO may cause toxic effects in diseased mice that were not apparent in the uninfected animals. However, the strong antiviral effect observed suggests that with further development, P-PMO may provide an effective therapeutic approach against a broad range of coronavirus infections.","Burrer, Renaud; Neuman, Benjamin W; Ting, Joey P C; Stein, David A; Moulton, Hong M; Iversen, Patrick L; Kuhn, Peter; Buchmeier, Michael J",Journal of virology,22,33

AIM To determine attitudes of parents towards possible future vaccinations for their children and the behavioural determinants associated with a negative attitude. DESIGN Questionnaire study. METHODS Parents of children aged between 3 months and 5 years of day-care centres were asked to fill out a questionnaire. Determinants of a negative attitude to comply with possible future vaccinations against example diseases such as pneumonia or influenza, hepatitis B, TBC, smallpox and SARS were assessed using polytomous logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Of the 283 respondents, 123 (43%) reported a positive attitude towards all vaccinations, 129 (46%) reported to have a positive attitude to have their child vaccinated against some diseases and 31 (11%) had no intention to comply with any new vaccination. Determinants of a fully negative attitude were a high education of the parent (odds ratio [OR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.3-8.6), being a health care worker (OR 4.2, 95% CI: 1.4-12.6), absence of religion (OR 2.6, 95% CI: 1.0-6.7), perception of vaccine ineffectiveness (OR 6.9, 95% CI: 2.5-18.9) and the perception that vaccinations cause asthma or allergies (OR 82.4, 95% CI: 8.9-766.8). CONCLUSION Modifiable determinants for a negative attitude to comply with new vaccinations are mainly based on lack of specific knowledge. These barriers to vaccinations might be overcome by improving health education in the vaccination program, especially when targeted at educated parents and health care workers.","Hak, E; Schönbeck, Y; De Melker, H; Van Essen, G A; Sanders, E A M",Vaccine,22,26

Coronavirus M and HE: two peculiar glycoproteins.,9.216706,5.6812797,1990,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently emerged infectious disease caused by a novel strain of coronavirus. Examination of the immune responses of patients who have recovered from SARS should provide important information for design of a safe and effective vaccine. We determined the continuous viral epitopes targeted by antibodies in plasma samples from convalescent SARS patients through biopanning with a vast M13 phage display dodecapeptide library. These epitopes converged to very short peptide fragments, one on each of the structural proteins spike and nucleocapsid and the nonstructural proteins 3a, 9b, and nsp 3. Immunoassays found that most of the patients who had recovered from SARS developed complementary antibodies to the epitope-rich region on the spike S2 protein, indicating that this is an immunodominant site on the viral envelope comprising the spike, matrix, and small envelope glycoproteins. These S2-targeting antibodies were shown to effectively neutralize the coronavirus, indicating that they provided protective immunity to help the patients recover from the viral infection. These results suggest that the SARS coronavirus might have an antigenic profile distinct from those of other human or animal coronaviruses. Due to the tested safety and protective effects of the convalescent-phase serological antibodies, identification of their complementary antigens may enable the design of an epitope-based vaccine to prevent potential antibody-mediated immunopathology.","Zhong, Xiaofen; Yang, Huanghao; Guo, Zu-Feng; Sin, Wan-Yee Fion; Chen, Wei; Xu, Junjie; Fu, Ling; Wu, Jie; Mak, Chun-Kit Gannon; Cheng, Chak-Sum Samuel; Yang, Yanzhen; Cao, Shuyong; Wong, Tin-Yau; Lai, Sik-To; Xie, Yong; Guo, Zhihong",Journal of virology,22,1

Upon sucrose gradient centrifugation, the major virus band was found at a density of 1.20 to 1.22 g/cm(3). This high density was observed only when TGEV with a functional sialic acid binding activity was analyzed. Mutants of TGEV that lacked sialic acid binding activity due to a point mutation in the sialic acid binding site of the S protein were mainly recovered at a lower-density position on the sucrose gradient (1.18 to 1.19 g/cm(3)). Neuraminidase treatment of purified virions resulted in a shift of the sedimentation value from the higher to the lower density. These results suggest that binding of sialoglycoproteins to the virion surface is responsible for the sedimentation behavior of TGEV. When purified virions were treated with octylglucoside to solubilize viral glycoproteins, ultracentrifugation resulted in sedimentation of the S protein of TGEV. However, when neuraminidase-treated virions or mutants with a defective sialic acid binding activity were analyzed, the S protein remained in the supernatant rather than in the pellet fraction. These results indicate that the interaction of the surface protein S with sialoglycoconjugates is maintained after solubilization of this viral glycoprotein by detergent treatment.","Krempl, C; Herrler, G",Journal of virology,22,33

Making a reliable, rapid clinical diagnosis is essential to appropriate patient management that may be especially important during shortages of antiviral agents caused by high demand. OBJECTIVES To systematically review the precision and accuracy of symptoms and signs of influenza. A secondary objective was to review the operating characteristics of rapid diagnostic tests for influenza (results available in <30 min). DATA SOURCES Structured search strategy using MEDLINE (January 1966-September 2004) and subsequent searches of bibliographies of retrieved articles to identify articles describing primary studies dealing with the diagnosis of influenza based on clinical signs and symptoms. The MEDLINE search used the Medical Subject Headings EXP influenza or EXP influenza A virus or EXP influenza A virus human or EXP influenza B virus and the Medical Subject Headings or terms EXP sensitivity and specificity or EXP medical history taking or EXP physical examination or EXP reproducibility of results or EXP observer variation or symptoms.mp or clinical signs.mp or sensitivity.mp or specificity.mp. STUDY SELECTION Of 915 identified articles on clinical assessment of influenza-related illness, 17 contained data on the operating characteristics of symptoms and signs using an independent criterion standard. Of these, 11 were eliminated based on 4 inclusion criteria and availability of nonduplicative primary data. DATA EXTRACTION Two authors independently reviewed and abstracted data for estimating the likelihood ratios (LRs) of clinical diagnostic findings. Differences were resolved by discussion and consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS No symptom or sign had a summary LR greater than 2 in studies that enrolled patients without regard to age. For decreasing the likelihood of influenza, the absence of fever (LR, 0.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.66), cough (LR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.31-0.57), or nasal congestion (LR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.42-0.59) were the only findings that had summary LRs less than 0.5. In studies limited to patients aged 60 years or older, the combination of fever, cough, and acute onset (LR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.8-7.7), fever and cough (LR, 5.0; 95% CI, 3.5-6.9), fever alone (LR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.8-5.0), malaise (LR, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.2-3.1), and chills (LR, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.0-3.2) increased the likelihood of influenza to the greatest degree. The presence of sneezing among older patients made influenza less likely (LR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.24-0.92). CONCLUSIONS Clinical findings identify patients with influenza-like illness but are not particularly useful for confirming or excluding the diagnosis of influenza. Clinicians should use timely epidemiologic data to ascertain if influenza is circulating in their communities, then either treat patients with influenza-like illness empirically or obtain a rapid influenza test to assist with management decisions.","Call, Stephanie A; Vollenweider, Mark A; Hornung, Carlton A; Simel, David L; McKinney, W Paul",JAMA,22,4

METHODS The incidence data of MERS were collected from the websites of the Korean government, WHO and authoritative media in Korea for this epidemiological analysis. RESULTS Between May 20 and July 13, 2015, a total of 186 confirmed MERS cases (1 index case, 29 secondary cases, 125 third generation cases, 25 fourth generation cases and 6 cases without clear generation data), including 36 deaths (case fatality rate: 19%), were reported in Korea. All cases were associated with nosocomial transmission except the index case and two possible family infections. Sixteen hospitals in 11 districts in 5 provinces/municipalities in Korea reported confirmed MERS cases, involving 39 medical professionals or staff. For the confirmed cases and death cases, the median ages were 55 years and 70 years respectively, and the cases and deaths in males accounted for 60% and 67% respectively. Up to 78% of the deaths were with underlying medical conditions. Besides the index case, other 12 patients were reported to cause secondary cases, in which 1 caused 84 infections. One imported MERS case from Korea was confirmed in China on May 29, no secondary cases occurred.

A household survey suggested that there may have been more than 39 million SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States by October 30, 2020, with an estimated infection fatality ratio of 0.64%; this compares with an estimated 7.3 million confirmed cases at that time. Several presentations found severe disruptions in HIV testing, prevention, and treatment services during COVID-19-related lockdowns; models suggest that severe interruption of antiretroviral therapy services could lead to a 1.5- to 3-fold increase in mortality. HIV testing remains the gateway to both treatment and prevention, and innovative strategies to improve testing uptake were presented. Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) agents may delay detection of HIV infection using standard testing algorithms. Data were presented on promising investigational PrEP agents, including cabotegravir, islatravir, and the dapivirine vaginal ring. Progress is being made in point-of-care assays to measure PrEP adherence with tenofovir-based regimens.

To better understand the mechanism(s) of H5N1 virus pathogenesis and host responses in humans, we utilized a polarized human bronchial epithelial cell model that expresses both avian alpha-2,3- and human alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors on the apical surface and supports productive replication of both H5N1 and H3N2 viruses. Using this model, we compared the abilities of selected 2004 HPAI H5N1 viruses isolated from humans and a recent human H3N2 virus to trigger the type I interferon (IFN) response. H5N1 viruses elicited significantly less IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) nuclear translocation, as well as delayed and reduced production of IFN-beta compared with the H3N2 virus. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Stat2 and induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as MX1, ISG15, IRF7, and retinoic acid-inducible gene I, were substantially delayed and reduced in cells infected with H5N1 viruses. We also observed that the highly virulent H5N1 virus replicated more efficiently and induced a weaker IFN response than the H5N1 virus that exhibited low virulence in mammals in an earlier study. Our data suggest that the H5N1 viruses tested, especially the virus with the high-pathogenicity phenotype, possess greater capability to attenuate the type I IFN response than the human H3N2 virus. The attenuation of this critical host innate immune defense may contribute to the virulence of H5N1 viruses observed in humans.","Zeng, Hui; Goldsmith, Cynthia; Thawatsupha, Pranee; Chittaganpitch, Malinee; Waicharoen, Sunthareeya; Zaki, Sherif; Tumpey, Terrence M; Katz, Jacqueline M",Journal of virology,22,1

This protein is present in a number of cell types, including those from the respiratory tract. Soon after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 that is responsible for the disease Covid-19, scientists found that ACE2 was also used by the new coronavirus to infect cells. This opened some interesting possibilities to explain the striking variation in risks of catching and dying from Covid-19. The best recognised of these are the much higher risk of serious illness in older than younger people, in men than women, and in those with pre-existing comorbidities such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. There are several ways in which the ACE2 protein might contribute to this variation. The most obvious would be if there is more ACE2, there would be more entry points for the virus to infect the cell, e.g. in older people or in men. However, the evidence for this is rather small, partly because it is not that easy to obtain representative healthy tissues. Alternatively, it could be related to ACE2 membership of a family of proteins that has one end of the protein anchored inside the cell while most of the protein protrudes from the outside of the cell which therefore can be shed when cleaved by proteases at the cell membrane. Herein we review current evidence and theories of ACE2 role on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and Covid-19 severity.","Azizan, E; Brown, M",The Malaysian journal of pathology,22,1

PMO antisense agents have been reported to effectively interfere with the replication of several positive-strand RNA viruses in cell culture. The filoviruses, Marburg virus and Ebola virus (EBOV), are negative-strand RNA viruses that cause up to 90% lethality in human outbreaks. There is currently no commercially available vaccine or efficacious therapeutic for any filovirus. In this study, PMO conjugated to arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide (P-PMO) and nonconjugated PMO were assayed for the ability to inhibit EBOV infection in cell culture and in a mouse model of lethal EBOV infection. A 22-mer P-PMO designed to base pair with the translation start site region of EBOV VP35 positive-sense RNA generated sequence-specific and time- and dose-dependent inhibition of EBOV amplification in cell culture. The same oligomer provided complete protection to mice when administered before or after an otherwise lethal infection of EBOV. A corresponding nonconjugated PMO, as well as nonconjugated truncated versions of 16 and 19 base residues, provided length-dependent protection to mice when administered prophylactically. Together, these data suggest that antisense PMO and P-PMO have the potential to control EBOV infection and are promising therapeutic candidates.","Enterlein, Sven; Warfield, Kelly L; Swenson, Dana L; Stein, David A; Smith, Jeffery L; Gamble, C Scott; Kroeker, Andrew D; Iversen, Patrick L; Bavari, Sina; Mühlberger, Elke",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,22,1

We have developed a reporter gene system to investigate the control of this differential subgenomic mRNA synthesis. Transcription of mRNAs by the TGEV polymerase was obtained from negative-sense RNA templates generated in situ from DNA containing a T7 promoter. A series of gene cassettes was produced; these cassettes comprised the reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene downstream of transcription-associated sequences (TASs) (also referred to as intergenic sequences and promoters) believed to be involved in the synthesis of TGEV subgenomic mRNAs 6 and 7. The gene cassettes were designed so that negative-sense RNA copies of the CAT gene with sequences complementary to the TGEV TASs, or modified versions, at the 3' end would be synthesized in situ by T7 RNA polymerase. Using this system, we have demonstrated that CAT was expressed from mRNAs derived from the T7-generated negative-sense RNA transcripts only in TGEV-infected cells and only from transcripts possessing a TGEV negative-sense TAS. Analysis of the CAT mRNAs showed the presence of the TGEV leader RNA sequence at the 5' end, in keeping with observations that all coronavirus mRNAs have a 5' leader sequence corresponding to the 5' end of the genomic RNA. Our results indicated that the CAT mRNAs were transcribed from the in situ-synthesized negative-sense RNA templates without the requirement of TGEV genomic 5' or 3' sequences on the T7-generated negative-sense transcripts (3'-TAS-CAT-5'). Modification of the TGEV TASs indicated (i) that the degree of potential base pairing between the 3' end of the leader RNA and the TGEV negative-sense TAS was not the sole determinant of the amount of subgenomic mRNA transcribed and (ii) that other factors, including nucleotides flanking the TAS, are involved in the regulation of transcription of TGEV subgenomic mRNAs.","Hiscox, J A; Mawditt, K L; Cavanagh, D; Britton, P",Journal of virology,22,20

Aim To describe possible consequences of the COVID-19 pandemia and the measures to control the spread of the virus, for the experiences of loss and mourning and to describe what is needed to prevent grief problems. Method Discussion of selected literature and consideration. Results The COVID-19 measures have an impact on the experiences of loss and mourning of bereaved people. The possibilities to appeal to social relationships have been limited due to the isolation measurements. Therefore, bereaved people might have a heightened risk to develop grief problems. Even though social support is of crucial interest in the processing of a loss, grief can also interfere with the possibilities to use social relationships. Research demonstrated a negative relationship between grief and social problem-solving skills. Thereby bereaved people face an additional challenge, to develop new goals, roles and attachment relationships under the current COVID-19 measurements of social isolation. Conclusion In times of COVID-19 society should pay more attention to experiences of loss and grief in order to activate social support for people bereaved during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Scientific guidance on how to prevent transmission and the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in dental settings, was lacking. Consequently, the dental community became highly anxious about the possible risk of transmission in dental settings. Because of the uncertainties regarding safety measures needed to practice safely, clinical operations at many dental schools were reduced to emergency services only. Some clinics reopened for expanded services later in the spring or summer of 2020 after COVID-19 safety protocols were adopted. This article reviews the evidence that was used to develop COVID-19 safety protocols at two dental schools: University of California San Francisco and Temple University. The policies were aimed at ensuring safety for all dental personnel and patients receiving dental care at the schools. At these two academic dental institutions there have been no reports of SARS-CoV-2 transmission due to exposure while dental care was being provided or received. This is a testament to the COVID-19 safety protocols put in place for the provision of dental care with minimized risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Rai, Ramneek; Ismail, Amid",Compendium of continuing education in dentistry,22,16

Peripheral induction of CTL specific for the nucleocapsid protein of JHMV by vaccination with recombinant vaccinia viruses was unable to provide significant protection to a subsequent lethal virus challenge. By contrast, the transfer of nucleoprotein-specific CTL protected mice from a subsequent lethal challenge by reducing virus replication within the central nervous system, demonstrating the importance of the CTL response to this epitope in JHMV infection. Transfer of these CTL directly into the central nervous system was at least 10-fold more effective than peripheral transfer. Histological analysis indicated that the CTL reduced virus replication in ependymal cells, astrocytes, and microglia.

The serum concentrations of interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor growth factor beta (TGF-beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The concentrations of IL-1 and TNF-alpha were not significantly different in different groups. The IL-6 concentration was increased in SARS patients and was significantly elevated in severe SARS patients, but the IL-6 concentrations were similar in convalescent patients and control subjects, suggesting that there was a positive relationship between the serum IL-6 concentration and SARS severity. The concentrations of IL-8 and TGF-beta were decreased in SARS patients and significantly reduced in severe SARS patients, but they were comparable in convalescent SARS patients and control subjects, suggesting that there was a negative relationship between the IL-8 and TGF-beta concentrations and SARS severity. The concentrations of IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-10 showed significant changes only in convalescent SARS patients. The IFN-gamma and IL-4 levels were decreased, while the levels of IL-10 were increased, and the differences between convalescent SARS patients and other patient groups were statistically significant.

FIPV 79-1146 and FECV 79-1683 are two genetically closely related representatives of the two pathotypes. Whereas FECV 79-1683 causes at the most a mild enteritis in young kittens, FIPV 79-1146 almost invariably induces a lethal peritonitis. The virulence phenotypes correlate with the abilities of these viruses to infect and replicate in macrophages, a feature of FIPV 79-1146 but not of FECV 79-1683. To identify the genetic determinants of the FIPV 79-1146 macrophage tropism, we exchanged regions of its genome with the corresponding parts of FECV 79-1683, after which the ability of the FIPV/FECV hybrid viruses to infect macrophages was tested. Thus, we established that the FIPV spike protein is the determinant for efficient macrophage infection. Interestingly, this property mapped to the C-terminal domain of the protein, implying that the difference in infection efficiency between the two viruses is not determined at the level of receptor usage, which we confirmed by showing that infection by both viruses was equally blocked by antibodies directed against the feline aminopeptidase N receptor. The implications of these findings are discussed.","Rottier, Peter J M; Nakamura, Kazuya; Schellen, Pepijn; Volders, Haukeline; Haijema, Bert Jan",Journal of virology,22,19

BACKGROUND Peripheral vascular interventions have been traditionally performed in the inpatient setting. However, there has been a recent shift away from hospital-based vascular interventions toward outpatient-based procedures. Data are scarce on the efficacy and safety of such procedures being performed in the outpatient setting. METHODS We performed a retrospective chart review of the first 500 consecutive procedures that were performed at an outpatient catheterization laboratory from February 2012 through February 2013. We separated the procedures into arteriovenous fistula (AVF)-related procedures, peripheral arterial disease (PAD)-related procedures, and miscellaneous procedures. The primary endpoint was procedure success rate, defined as postintervention residual stenosis of <30% on angiography. The secondary endpoint was procedure-related adverse events. RESULTS The success rate for AVF-related interventions was 90%, and 93% when including partially successful interventions. The success rate for PAD-related interventions was 82%, and 92% when including partially successful interventions. The procedure success rate for miscellaneous interventions was 89%. Five AVF-related procedures suffered an adverse event (1.49%). Two PAD-related procedures suffered an adverse event (1.3%), while no adverse events were noted among miscellaneous procedures. One patient required immediate postprocedure hospitalization due to iliac artery perforation. CONCLUSION Peripheral vascular procedures performed in the outpatient setting are safe and effective. A comparison of outcomes between outpatient and inpatient facilities when performing similar peripheral vascular interventions is needed in order to determine whether a transition of further vascular procedures into an outpatient setting is justified.","Mesbah Oskui, Peyman; Kloner, Robert A; Burstein, Steven; Zhiroff, Katrine; Kartub, Benjamin Richard; Economides, Christina; Brook, Jenny; Mayeda, Guy S",The Journal of invasive cardiology,22,19

The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in serial radiologic findings in patients with H7N9 pneumonia. METHODS The two institutional ethics review boards approved this retrospective study. This study included 10 patients with H7N9 pneumonia. All patients underwent chest radiologic examinations at different time points. Serial radiologic images were systematically analyzed. RESULTS All patients showed abnormal results on initial chest radiography and CT. The initial radiographic abnormalities were unilateral (n = 9) and bilateral (n = 1), including ground-glass opacities (GGOs) (n = 5) and consolidation (n = 5). The initial CT findings consisted of unilateral (n = 6) and bilateral (n = 4), including consolidation (n = 10), GGOs (n = 10), reticular opacities (n = 2), and pleural effusion (n = 3). Follow-up radiologic findings showed rapid development of consolidation or GGOs within two weeks after illness onset. Pneumomediastinum with secondary subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax were noted in two patients. Follow-up high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) after two weeks showed slow improvement in both size and opacity of the lesions. On HRCT after discharge, patients had substantial residual lesions such as irregular linear opacities, reticular opacities, parenchymal bands, traction bronchiectasis, and cystic lesions. CONCLUSIONS The most common radiologic findings at presentation are multifocal or diffuse areas of consolidation and GGOs in H7N9 pneumonia. HRCT in sequence can show more changes in rapid progression of disease and a slow decrease of both size and opacity of the lesions plays an important role in the evaluation of H7N9 pneumonia.","Dai, Jian; Zhou, Xianmei; Dong, Danjiang; Liu, Yin; Gu, Qin; Zhu, Bin; Wu, Chao; Cai, Hourong",Chinese medical journal,22,11

In this study, we identified another viral protein, the spike of SARS-CoV, which played an important role in virus-stimulated COX-2 expression after screening all genes from the SARS-CoV genome. We found that an upstream calcium-dependent PKC isozyme PKC alpha that modulates the downstream ERK/NF-kappaB pathway through an influx of extracellular Ca2+ is induced by the spike protein of SARS-CoV. The ERK/NF-kappaB was identified to be involved in the activation of COX-2 promoter and production of COX-2 protein in HEK293T cells. We also demonstrated that another unusual pathway, the calcium-independent PI3K/PKC epsilon/JNK/CREB pathway, functioned in cooperation with the calcium-dependent pathway to induce COX-2 expression upon stimulation by spike protein. This pathway can be blocked by PKC epsilon-specific, small interfering RNA, PI3K/JNK kinase-specific inhibitors as well as dominant negative JNK. PKC epsilon-specific siRNA also attenuated the phosphorylation of JNK. Our results provide evidence that helps us understand the function of SRAS-CoV spike protein in SARS pathogenesis.","Liu, Mo; Yang, Yongbo; Gu, Chunfang; Yue, Yinpu; Wu, Kenneth K; Wu, Jianguo; Zhu, Ying",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,22,16

DESIGN Observational study with a nested case-control group. SETTING Two suburban general practices in Arnold, Nottingham, over 7 winter months. SUBJECTS 367 adults aged 16 years and over fulfilling a definition of lower respiratory tract infection and treated with antibiotics. 74 (20%) patients who reconsulted within 4 weeks for the same symptoms and 82 ""control"" patients who did not were investigated in detail at fallow up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Direct and indirect evidence of active infection at the time of the reconsultation or the follow up visit with the research nurse for the controls. Investigations performed included sputum culture, pneumococcal antigen detection, serial serology for viral and atypical pathogens and C reactive protein, throat swabs for detecting viral and atypical pathogens by culture and polymerase chain reaction, and chest radiographs. RESULTS Demographic and clinical features of the groups were similar. Two thirds of the 74 patients who reconsulted received another antibiotic because the general practitioner suspected continuing infection. Any evidence of infection warranting antibiotic treatment was uncommon at reconsultation. The findings for the two groups were similar for the occurrence of identified pathogens; chest x ray changes of infection (present in 13%); and C reactive protein concentrations, which had nearly all fallen towards normal. Only three patients in the reconsultation group had concentrations > or = 40 mg/l. Pathogens identified at follow up in the 156 patients in both groups included ampicillin sensitive bacteria in six. Atypical infections diagnosed in 27 (Chlamydia pneumoniae in 22) and viral infections in 54 had probably been present at the initial presentation. CONCLUSION Our study suggests that active infection, which may benefit from further antibiotics, is uncommon in patients who reconsult after a lower respiratory tract infection, and a repeat antibiotic prescription should be the exception rather than the rule. Other factors, such as patients' perception of their illness, may be more important than disease and infection in their decision to reconsult.","Macfarlane, J; Prewett, J; Rose, D; Gard, P; Cunningham, R; Saikku, P; Euden, S; Myint, S",BMJ,22,17

The coronavirus genome is capped at the 5' end and has a 3' UTR that consists of 300 to 500 nucleotides (nt) plus a poly(A) tail. To further our understanding of coronavirus replication, we have begun to examine the involvement of host factors in this process for two group II viruses, bovine coronavirus (BCV) and mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV). Specific host protein interactions with the BCV 3' UTR [287 nt plus poly(A) tail] were identified using gel mobility shift assays. Competition with the MHV 3' UTR [301 nt plus poly(A) tail] suggests that the interactions are conserved for the two viruses. Proteins with molecular masses of 99, 95, and 73 kDa were detected in UV cross-linking experiments. Less heavily labeled proteins were also detected in the ranges of 40 to 50 and 30 kDa. The poly(A) tail was required for binding of the 73-kDa protein. Immunoprecipitation of UV-cross-linked proteins identified the 73-kDa protein as the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). Replication of the defective genomes BCV Drep and MHV MIDI-C, along with several mutants, was used to determine the importance of the poly(A) tail. Defective genomes with shortened poly(A) tails consisting of 5 or 10 A residues were replicated after transfection into helper virus-infected cells. BCV Drep RNA that lacked a poly(A) tail did not replicate, whereas replication of MHV MIDI-C RNA with a deleted tail was detected after several virus passages. All mutants exhibited delayed kinetics of replication. Detectable extension or addition of the poly(A) tail to the mutants correlated with the appearance of these RNAs in the replication assay. RNAs with shortened poly(A) tails exhibited less in vitro PABP binding, suggesting that decreased interactions with the protein may affect RNA replication. The data strongly indicate that the poly(A) tail is an important cis-acting signal for coronavirus replication.","Spagnolo, J F; Hogue, B G",Journal of virology,22,22

We performed a prospective single arm trial to provide early initial data regarding the safety and angiographic durability of a new coil technology, the Axium MicroFX Polyglycolic/polylactic acid (PGLA) coil, which was designed to lower recanalization rates. Fifteen patients (16 aneurysms) were prospectively enrolled. Demographic and peri-procedural data were collected. Angiographic images of the initial coil embolization and three to six month follow-up angiographic images underwent blinded evaluation. Seven (47%) SAH and eight (53%) elective patients were enrolled. Blinded evaluation of the initial embolization demonstrated that 5/16 (31%) aneurysms achieved Raymond grade 1, 5/16 (31%) grade 2 and 6/16 (38%) grade 3. Three to six month angiography was obtained in 12/15 patients (80%); two patients expired (1 SAH, 1 elective) and one was lost to follow-up (SAH). All patients who underwent follow-up angiography had a mRS ≤1.

One patient developed an asymptomatic peri-aneurysmal parent vessel stenosis. Axium MicroFX coils appear to be safe, though the small number of patients in this series obviates comparative analysis with other series. Further studies are needed with more patients to compare the angiographic durability of Axium MicroFX coils to other coils.","Waldau, B; Fargen, K M; Mack, W J; Wilson, N M; Khaldi, A; Hoh, B L; Mocco, J","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",22,1

The primary aim was to perform a critical analysis of duration of convalescence from work and activity and secondary to identify risk factors for unexpected prolonged convalescence after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. METHODS A qualitative systematic review was conducted. PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane database were searched for trials reporting convalescence after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in the period from January 1990 to January 2016. Furthermore, snowball search was performed in reference lists of identified articles. Randomized controlled trials and prospective comparative or non-comparative trials of high quality were included. Trials with ≥100 patients, >18 years of age and manuscripts in English were included. Scoring systems were used for assessment of quality. RESULTS The literature search identified 1039 papers. Thirty-four trials were included in the final review including 14,273 patients. There was overall a large variation in duration of convalescence. Trials using non-restrictive recommendations of 1-2 days or ""as soon as possible to return to all activities"" reported overall a shorter duration of convalescence compared with trials not using recommendations for convalescence. Strenuous physical activity at work, strenuous leisure activity and patients with expectations of a prolonged period of convalescence may be risk factors for prolonged convalescence extending more than a few days after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. CONCLUSIONS Patients should be recommended a duration of 1-2 days of convalescence after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. Short and non-restrictive recommendations may reduce duration of convalescence without increasing risk of pain, complications or recurrence rate.","Tolver, Mette Astrup; Rosenberg, Jacob; Bisgaard, Thue",Surgical endoscopy,22,19

In addition, sporadic outbreaks of human monkeypox in Africa and a recent outbreak of human monkeypox in the U.S. have made it clear that naturally occurring zoonotic orthopoxvirus diseases remain a public health concern. Much of the threat posed by orthopoxviruses could be eliminated by vaccination; however, because the smallpox vaccine is a live orthopoxvirus vaccine (vaccinia virus) administered to the skin, the vaccine itself can pose a serious health risk. Here, we demonstrate that rhesus macaques vaccinated with a DNA vaccine consisting of four vaccinia virus genes (L1R, A27L, A33R, and B5R) were protected from severe disease after an otherwise lethal challenge with monkeypox virus. Animals vaccinated with a single gene (L1R) which encodes a target of neutralizing antibodies developed severe disease but survived.

The crowding agent polyethylene glycol can induce bacteriophage ø29 monomeric capsid protein and dimeric scaffolding protein to co-assemble to form particles which have the same geometry as either prolate T=3 Q=5 procapsids formed in vivo or previously observed isometric particles. The formation of particles is a scaffolding-dependent reaction. The balance between the fidelity and efficiency of assembly is controlled by the concentration of crowding agent and temperature. The assembly process is salt sensitive, suggesting that the interactions between the scaffolding and coat proteins are electrostatic. Three N-terminal ø29 scaffolding protein deletion mutants, Delta 1-9, Delta 1-15 and Delta 1-22, abolish the assembly activity. Circular dichroism spectra indicate that these N-terminal deletions are accompanied by a loss of helicity. The inability of these proteins to dimerize suggests that the N-terminal region of the scaffolding protein contributes to the dimer interface and maintains the structural integrity of the dimeric protein. Two C-terminal scaffolding protein deletion mutants, Delta 79-97 and Delta 62-97, also fail to promote assembly. However, the secondary structure and the dimerization ability of these mutants are unchanged relative to wild-type, which suggests that the C terminus is the likely site of interaction with the capsid protein.","Fu, Chi-yu; Morais, Marc C; Battisti, Anthony J; Rossmann, Michael G; Prevelige, Peter E",Journal of molecular biology,22,8

An urgent meeting of scientific and public health experts was convened by WHO in January 2013 in view of the limited knowledge available on the epidemiological and natural history of infection with this novel virus. The meeting reviewed current evidence and identified critical knowledge gaps to improve better understanding of the public health risk associated with the virus so as to improve preparedness and to safeguard and protect global health.","Joseph, C; Malik, M R; Mounts, A W; Mafi, A R; Briand, S; Memish, Z A",Eastern Mediterranean health journal = La revue de sante de la Mediterranee orientale = al-Majallah al-sihhiyah li-sharq al-mutawassit,22,20

Evidence was needed to inform strategies for limiting COVID-19 transmission on public transport. On 20 March 2020, we searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Web of Science and the World Health Organization's database of 'Global research on coronavirus disease (COVID-19)' to conduct a rapid review on interventions that reduce viral transmission on public ground transport. After screening 74 records, we identified 4 eligible studies. These studies suggest an increased risk of viral transmission with public transportation use that may be reduced with improved ventilation. International and national guidelines suggest the following strategies: keep the public informed, stay at home when sick, and minimise public transport use. Where use is unavoidable, environmental control, respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene are recommended, while a risk-based approach needs to guide the use of non-medical masks.","Zhen, J; Chan, C; Schoonees, A; Apatu, E; Thabane, L; Young, T",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,22,33

The clinical diagnosis of FIP was confirmed by necropsy, histology and direct immunofluorescence against the coronaviruses on cryostatic sections. The immune cells were detected immunohistochemically by the Avidin-Biotin-Complex (ABC) method using either polyclonal antibodies against lymphoid antigens (CD3) or monoclonal antibodies against lymphoid (PAN-T, CD4, CD8) and myeloid antigens (MAC387). Better identification of T cells and macrophages was found on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections than on cryostatic ones, while T lymphocyte subpopulations could be differentiated only in cryostatic sections. Type IV hypersensitivity was detected in focal feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV)-induced lesions from progressive activation of T lymphocytes, mainly CD4+, and the presence of granulocytes and macrophages. The FIPV-induced lesions could be studied as examples of granulomas caused by unconventional antigens, such as viruses or immune complexes.","Paltrinieri, S; Cammarata Parodi, M; Cammarata, G; Mambretti, M",Zentralblatt fur Veterinarmedizin.

We aimed to report the diagnosis and management of a case with SDAVF. CASE REPORT A 62-year-old man suffered from acute paraparesis about 15 months before this study. He underwent a neurosurgical procedure for herniated discs of the cervical spine at that time but there was no relief and the symptoms worsened despite the surgery. Neurologically, he had spastic paraparesis and decreased vibration sensation of the lower limbs. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed intra-medullary hyper-intensity lesion at T8 to T10 levels and tubular-like signal void structures in the corresponding posterior sub-arachnoid space. Further trans-arterial angiography through right T6 intercostal artery catheterization revealed engorged veins, thereby confirming the diagnosis of SDAVF. The patient was treated via endovascular embolization (18% Onyx, EV3TM MIT, Bonn, Germany) through spinal angiography and the results showed a marked decrease in engorged veins. After a 4-month follow-up, the patient was symptomatic but stable. Follow-up MRI showed a complete disappearance of the hyper-intensity change of the spinal cord. Spinal MR angiography did not reveal any recurrence of SDAVF. CONCLUSION This case study demonstrated the easily misdiagnosed state of SDAVF. Serial neuroimage studies including spinal MRI, endovascular embolization through spinal angiography and MR angiography can be useful tools for its diagnostic confirmation, management and follow-up study.","Lien, Chia-Yi; Lui, Chun-Chung; Lu, Cheng-Hsien; Chang, Wen-Neng",Acta neurologica Taiwanica,22,33

The 180-kDa oligomeric S protein of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 is posttranslationally cleaved into an S1 receptor binding unit and an S2 membrane fusion unit. The latter is thought to contain an internal fusion peptide and has two 4,3 hydrophobic (heptad) repeat regions designated HR1 and HR2. HR2 is located close to the membrane anchor, and HR1 is some 170 amino acids (aa) upstream of it. Heptad repeat (HR) regions are found in fusion proteins of many different viruses and form an important characteristic of class I viral fusion proteins. We investigated the role of these regions in coronavirus membrane fusion. Peptides HR1 (96 aa) and HR2 (39 aa), corresponding to the HR1 and HR2 regions, were produced in Escherichia coli. When mixed together, the two peptides were found to assemble into an extremely stable oligomeric complex. Both on their own and within the complex, the peptides were highly alpha helical. Electron microscopic analysis of the complex revealed a rod-like structure approximately 14.5 nm in length. Limited proteolysis in combination with mass spectrometry indicated that HR1 and HR2 occur in the complex in an antiparallel fashion. In the native protein, such a conformation would bring the proposed fusion peptide, located in the N-terminal domain of HR1, and the transmembrane anchor into close proximity. Using biological assays, the HR2 peptide was shown to be a potent inhibitor of virus entry into the cell, as well as of cell-cell fusion. Both biochemical and functional data show that the coronavirus spike protein is a class I viral fusion protein.","Bosch, Berend Jan; van der Zee, Ruurd; de Haan, Cornelis A M; Rottier, Peter J M",Journal of virology,22,14

The objective of the study was to assess the levels of anxiety and depression in COVID-19 patients. We adopted a mixed online and telephone-based survey using Google Forms. Recruitment was performed through a snowball sampling approach. The Google Form was initially circulated in Facebook to identify interested participants. Then, three trained physicians interviewed the online responders over telephone for a period spanning from April 2020 to June 2020. Two well-known questionnaires, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), were used for the assessment of anxiety and depression, respectively. Here, the severity of anxiety was classified with the standard thresholds: minimal or none (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14) and severe (>15) for the GAD-7. Depression severity score: 0-4 was considered as none or no depression, 5-9: mild, 10-14: moderate, 15-19: moderately severe, 20-27 was for severe depression. A total of 237 patients were finally analyzed. The mean age ±SD of the patients was 41.59±13.73 years. Most of them were male (73%) and lived in urban areas (90.29%). Half of the patients were unemployed, and 17.7% admitted loss of job due to lockdown. The overall prevalence of anxiety and depression was 55.7% and 87.3%, respectively. The mean GAD-7 score was 5.79±4.95, and the mean PHQ-9 score was 5.64±5.15. Among the depressive patients, 3% had minimal depression, 38.4% had mild depression, 32.1% had moderate depression, 11.8% had moderate depression, and 2.1% had a severe depression. Similarly, 37.1%, 10.5% and 8% had mild, moderate and severe levels of anxiety, respectively. Nearly half of the study population (47.7%) was suffering from both depression and anxiety. Living in urban area was an independent predictor for depression (OR 3.882; CI: 1.249-12.069). Considering the high comorbid burden, the mental health issues of these patients need to be addressed and reinforced to the existing health system on a priority basis.","Hasan, M J; Tabssum, T; Ambia, N E; Zaman, M S; Rahman, M; Khan, A S",Mymensingh medical journal : MMJ,22,5

Healthcare professionals are the people in the front line of situations like this. Their perspectives on the pandemic is critical to their safety and the outcomes in patients they manage. The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice regarding COVID-19 among clinical healthcare professionals in Bingham University Teaching Hospital (BHUTH) Jos. Materials and Methods A total of 138 clinical health workers from BHUTH completed a questionnaire- based study on the knowledge, attitude and practice on COVID-19 from the April 1st to 30th May 2020. Consecutive sampling method was used for data collection and the distribution of responses was presented as frequencies and percentages. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test was used to investigate the level of association among variables at the significance level of p<0.05. Results The highest mean of correct responses for knowledge were from doctors, pharmacists and nurses with 19.1±2.35, 19.4±1.52 and 18.9±1.73 respectively. The lowest mean was from pharmacist assistant and nurse aids with 17.1±1.81. The difference was statistically significant with Anaysis of Variance (F) of 5.75 and p value of 0.001. The attitude and practice mean were good between the different clinical cadre; however, the difference was not significant. Conclusion There is good knowledge, attitude and practice among the doctors and pharmacists, nurses, nurse assistants and pharmacist assistants. The doctors and pharmacist had better scores.

A SYBR Green I-based real-time RT-PCR was designed with a conventional, inexpensive RT-PCR kit targeting the F gene of the NDV LaSota strain. The method developed in this study was validated for specificity, accuracy, precision, linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), and robustness. The validation results satisfied the predetermined acceptance criteria. The validated method was used to quantify virus samples produced in an animal cell culture-based production system. The method was able to quantify the NDV samples from mid- or late-production phases, but not effective on samples from the early-production phase. For comparison with other quantifiable methods, immunoblotting, plaque assay, and tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) assay were also performed with the NDV samples. The results demonstrated that the real-time RT-PCR method is suitable for the rapid quantification of virus particles produced in an animal cell-culture-based production system irrespective of viral infectivity.","Jang, Juno; Hong, Sung-Hwan; Kim, Ik-Hwan",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,22,7
196065,196065,196065,Inefficient infection of soluble receptor-resistant mutants of murine coronavirus in cells expressing MHVR2 receptor.,9.298427,6.1498404,2001,"The cellular receptor for the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) has been identified as a member of the murine carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family (R. K. Williams, G. S. Jiang, and K. V. Holmes, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:5533-5536, 1991). However, the receptor protein was not detected in some of the susceptible mouse tissues. We therefore examined whether other types of MHV receptor might exist. By polymerase chain reaction with the conserved sequences of murine CEA gene family members (mmCGM) as primers, we detected two CEA-encoding RNAs in the mouse liver. One of them (1.3 kb) encodes mmCGM1, which has previously been identified as the receptor for MHV, and the other one (0.8 kb) was shown to encode another member of mouse CGM, mmCGM2. The sequence analysis showed that mmCGM2 lacks 564 nucleotides in the middle of the gene compared with mmCGM1. These two CEA transcripts are probably derived from the same gene by an alternative splicing mechanism. Expression of either of these cDNA clones in COS-7 cells rendered these cells susceptible to MHV infection, suggesting that not only mmCGM1 but also mmCGM2 serves as a receptor for MHV. The mmCGM2 was the major CEA species in the mouse brain, which is a main target organ for the neurotropic strains of MHV. Very little mmCGM1 was detected in the mouse brain or in cells of the susceptible mouse astrocytoma cell line DBT. This result indicates that MHV may utilize different CEA molecules as the major receptor in the mouse brain and in the liver. This is a first identification of multiple receptors for a single virus. The presence of different receptors in different tissues may explain the target cell specificity of certain MHVs.","Yokomori, K; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,22,1

RNA interactions.,9.369142,6.0363317,1998,"We have identified the binding site of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the S2 subunit of the bovine coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein. The location of this site was first investigated by using prokaryotic expression of DNA restriction fragments covering the entire S gene. The amino acid sequence containing the antibody binding site was shortened from 70 to 20 amino acids by digestion of plasmid DNA with exonuclease III, followed by sequencing of the smallest digestion product encoding an immunoreactive fusion protein. Finally we synthesized a set of nonapeptides covering the 20 amino acid sequence extending from the N-terminal residue of the S2 subunit (Ala 769 to Tyr 798). MAbs reacted mainly with six consecutive overlapping peptides with the sequence TTGYRFTNFEPFTV. Polyclonal antibodies from hyperimmunized or convalescent animals reacted only with the recombinant proteins identified by MAbs, and the hyperimmune serum bound to the same set of peptides. This suggests that this highly conserved linear antigenic determinant corresponds to an immunodominant region. This region resembles both in location and immunodominance the linear determinant defined on the infectious bronchitis virus S2 subunit. The presence of similar regions in the N-terminal region of the S2 subunit of other coronaviruses is discussed.","Vautherot, J F; Laporte, J; Boireau, P",The Journal of general virology,22,1

METHODS Using multiplex-PCR, respiratory tract viruses were investigated in the respiratory tract specimens from patient and control groups followed in the Pediatric Clinic. RESULTS The viruses detected in the patient and control groups (p=0.013) were as follows, respectively: rhinoviruses A, B, C (25.6% and 36.7%), influenza virus A (21.1% and 0.0%), parainfluenza virus type 1 (7.8% and 1.7%), parainfluenza virus type 4 (5.6% and 0.0%), adenoviruses A, B, C, D, E (4.4% and 1.7%), parainfluenza virus type 3 (4.4% and 1.7%), coronaviruses 229E and NL63 (4.4% and 1.7%), coronavirus OC43 (3.3% and 0.0%), respiratory syncytial virus A (3.3% and 0.0%), parainfluenza virus type 2 (2.2% and 0.0%), influenza virus B (2.2% and 0.0%), and respiratory syncytial virus B (1.1% and 1.7%). No bocavirus, metapneumovirus or enterovirus was found in any specimen. Statistically significant differences in the detection of influenza virus A (p=0.000), the total detection of parainfluenza viruses (p=0.008) and co-infection (p=0.004) were observed between the patient and control groups. CONCLUSIONS The advantage of our study compared with other studies is the inclusion of not only wheezing patients but also children with asthma without symptom. The higher detection of Rhinoviruses both in patient and control groups give rise to thought that these viruses may be responsible for asthma exacerbations and may be related with long duration of virus shedding.","Dabaniyasti, Demet; Eksi, Fahriye; Keskin, Özlem; Özkars, Mehmet Y; Karsligil, Tekin; Balci, Iclal",Minerva pediatrica,22,9

Responding to the pandemic, multi-agency collaborative partnerships put in place actions integrating point-of-care antibody testing at established large-scale COVID-19 testing sites where the baseline seropositivity of COVID-19 in health care workers and first responders in Florida at the start of the pandemic was established. Purpose Determine the seropositivity of healthcare workers and first responders at five drive thru testing sites using a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody test in Florida from May 6 through June 3, 2020. Methods The first drive-thru SARS-CoV-2 antibody test site was opened at Miami Hard Rock Stadium, May 6, 2020. Testing expanded to three additional sites on May 9, 2020: Jacksonville, Orlando, and Palm Beach. The fifth and final site, Miami Beach, began testing on May 21, 2020. Healthcare workers and first responder's self-seeking SARS-CoV-2 testing were designated for antibody testing and completed a laboratory collection form onsite for the point-of-care test. All testing was performed on whole blood specimens (obtained by venipuncture) using the Cellex Inc. qSARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Rapid Test. Seropositivity was assessed by univariate analysis and by logistic regression including the covariates age, sex, race/ethnicity, and testing location. Results and Discussion As of June 3, 2020, of 5,779 healthcare workers and first responders tested, 4.1% were seropositive (range 2.6-8.2%).

A wide variety of active phytochemicals, including the flavonoids, terpenoids, lignans, sulphides, polyphenolics, coumarins, saponins, furyl compounds, alkaloids, polyines, thiophenes, proteins and peptides have been identified. Some volatile essential oils of commonly used culinary herbs, spices and herbal teas have also exhibited a high level of antiviral activity. However, given the few classes of compounds investigated, most of the pharmacopoeia of compounds in medicinal plants with antiviral activity is still not known. Several of these phytochemicals have complementary and overlapping mechanisms of action, including antiviral effects by either inhibiting the formation of viral DNA or RNA or inhibiting the activity of viral reproduction. Assay methods to determine antiviral activity include multiple-arm trials, randomized crossover studies, and more compromised designs such as nonrandomized crossovers and pre- and post-treatment analyses. Methods are needed to link antiviral efficacy/potency- and laboratory-based research.

We studied the macromolecular interactions involved in coronavirus assembly in cells infected with a murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Coimmunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated an interaction between N protein and M protein in infected cells. Pulse-labeling experiments showed that newly synthesized, unglycosylated M protein interacted with N protein in a pre-Golgi compartment, which is part of the MHV budding site. Coimmunoprecipitation analyses further revealed that M protein interacted with only genomic-length MHV mRNA, mRNA 1, while N protein interacted with all MHV mRNAs. These data indicated that M protein interacted with the nucleocapsid, consisting of N protein and mRNA 1, in infected cells. The M protein-nucleocapsid interaction occurred in the absence of S and E proteins. Intracellular M protein-N protein interaction was maintained after removal of viral RNAs by RNase treatment. However, the M protein-N protein interaction did not occur in cells coexpressing M protein and N protein alone. These data indicated that while the M protein-N protein interaction, which is independent of viral RNA, occurred in the M protein-nucleocapsid complex, some MHV function(s) was necessary for the initiation of M protein-nucleocapsid interaction. The M protein-nucleocapsid interaction, which occurred near or at the MHV budding site, most probably represented the process of specific packaging of the MHV genome into MHV particles.","Narayanan, K; Maeda, A; Maeda, J; Makino, S",Journal of virology,22,9

Specimens from the first day of his admission were among the first to demonstrate the novel coronavirus, by culture, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and rising of specific antibody, but proper protective measures remained unknown. The authors instituted airborne, droplet and contact precautions from the time of admission, and reviewed the efficacy of these measures. MATERIAL AND METHOD A specific unit was set up to care for the physician, beginning by roping off an isolated room and using a window fan to create negative pressure, and later by constructing a glass-walled antechamber, designated changing and decontamination areas, and adding high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was consistently enforced by nurse managers for all the staff and visitors, including a minimum of N95 respirators, goggles or face shields, double gowns, double gloves, full head and shoe covering, and full Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) for intubation. To assess the adherence to PPE and the possibility of transmission to exposed staff a structured questionnaire was administered and serum samples tested for SARS coronavirus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Exposure was defined as presence on the SARS ward or contact with laboratory specimens, and close contact was presence in the patient's room. RESULTS The WHO physician died from respiratory failure on day 19. 112 of 129 exposed staff completed questionnaires, and the 70 who entered the patient's room reported a mean of 42 minutes of exposure (range 6 minutes-23.5 hours). 100% reported consistent handwashing after exposure, 95% consistently used a fit-tested N95 or greater respirator, and 80% were fully compliant with strict institutional PPE protocol. No staff developed an illness consistent with SARS. Serum samples from 35 close contacts obtained after day 28 had a negative result for SARS coronavirus antibody. CONCLUSIONS Hospitalization of one of the earliest SARS patients with documented coronavirus shedding provided multiple opportunities for spread to the hospital staff, but strict enforcement of conservative infection control recommendations throughout the hospitalization was associated with no transmission.","Chaovavanich, Achara; Wongsawat, Jurai; Dowell, Scott F; Inthong, Yaowarat; Sangsajja, Chariya; Sanguanwongse, Natpatou; Martin, Michael T; Limpakarnjanarat, Khanchit; Sirirat, Likanonsakul; Waicharoen, Sunthreeya; Chittaganpitch, Malinee; Thawatsupha, Pranee; Auwanit, Wattana; Sawanpanyalert, Pathom; Melgaard, Bjorn",Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,22,28

METHODS All patients with suspected SARS and normal chest radiographs on admission within the study period were subjected to HRCT examination. The clinical, radiologic, and laboratory data of patients who were confirmed to have SARS-associated coronavirus infection by a positive nasopharyngeal aspirate, stool or urine reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or serological testing were prospectively followed up and analyzed. Characteristics of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those that were not were compared. RESULTS Among 47 suspected SARS patients with normal chest radiographs, 27 had SARS-associated coronavirus infection confirmed by RT-PCR and/or positive serological testing. Twenty-five of the 27 (93%) patients had HRCT changes compatible with atypical pneumonia, and all 25 patients developed SARS with progressive clinical deterioration. Ten (40%) had unifocal diseases, and 15 had multifocal diseases (60%). Ten (40%) patients had the diseases confined to 1 single lung in the first HRCT, and both lungs were involved at initial presentation in 15 (60%) patients. Concerning the overall extent of the disease at initial presentation, 3 (12%) patients had disease process in all lobes, and the disease was confined to 1 single lobe in 10 (40%) patients. The disease process was mainly peripheral in location (96%), and the lower lobes were more commonly involved (68% in the left lower lobe and 64% in the right lower lobe). Small parapneumonic effusions occurred in 1 (4%) patient. None of the patients with unifocal lesions or single-lung involvement were admitted to the ICU (P < 0.05) (in both comparisons). Subsequent follow-up of the 2 (7%) patients with normal HRCT on admission showed that they were having nonpneumonic SARS-associated coronavirus infection only and were eventually denotified from having SARS. CONCLUSIONS HRCT is useful for early diagnosis of SARS-associated coronavirus pneumonia in patients with normal chest radiographs. HRCT findings in these patients predict potentially severe disease.","Hui, Joyce Yee-Hing; Hon, Timothy Yu-Wai; Yang, Michael Kwok-Wai; Cho, Danny Hing-Yan; Luk, Wing-Hang; Chan, Ronee Yun-Yee; Chan, Kin-Sang; Loke, Tony Kwok-Loon; Chan, James Chi-Sang",Journal of computer assisted tomography,22,19

Psychosocial needs change throughout the disaster cycle, particularly as social support deteriorates over time. It is important to anticipate what psychosocial needs of the public, emergency responders, support staff, and volunteers might emerge, before advancing to the next stage of the disaster.

METHODS One hundred and nineteen SARS outpatients, including 64 men and 55 women, with mean age (34.1 +/- 11.4) years and average days of discharge from hospital (28.0 +/- 12.8) days, were assessed by the St George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ), and 72 patients with spirometry test. RESULTS The patients had a moderately degree physiological impairment and increased SGRQ score. Scores of all four part of SGRQ correlated significantly with diffuse capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide/pre (DLco%). The correlation coefficients between the activation, impaction, total score, and diffuse capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide/alveolar ventilation/pre (DLco/Va%) were resembled (r = 0.47-0.54, P < 0.01). There was a significant relationship between the score of SGRQ and patients age, and gender. The time leaving hospital only had a significant relationship with the symptom score of SGRQ. CONCLUSIONS SGRQ is a sensitive tool for assessing quality of life in cured SARS patients. The cured SARS patients' quality of life decrease moderately.","Liu, Tao; Peng, Min; Cai, Bai-qiang; Xu, Wen-bing; Cao, Bin; Ma, Yi; Li, Tai-sheng; Wang, Zhong; Jin, Zheng-yu",Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

Therefore, prevention of respiratory infections is an important goal for public health interventions. In this context, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) represent an interesting perspective for research and development by virtue of their favorable antimicrobial activity against many respiratory pathogens. One of the latest innovations in the biotech field discussed in this review is the creation of a biocompatible, biogel-based nasal filter enriched with AgNPs. Compared to traditional personal protective equipment (PPE), this type of nasal filter has the advantage of combining the antibacterial and antiviral activity of AgNPs with the common filtration capacity shared by other PPEs. This dual mechanism means that AgNP-enriched nasal filters serve to reduce the infecting microbial-load and protect the lower airways, without interfering with the normal respiratory capacity (airflow-resistance <5%). Given their antimicrobial characteristics and performance, AgNP-enriched nasal filters can meet many community and occupational currently unmet needs in the prevention of airborne infectious diseases, by ensuring an excellent respiratory-comfort and a continuous day-use.","Cento, Julia Valeria; Barbaliscia, Silvia; Perno, Carlo Federico",The new microbiologica,22,26

Since there has been only limited characterization of these viruses, we investigated the genomic and phenotypic differences between these novel IBVs and other, classical IBVs. The 3' 7.5 kb of the genomes of 17 Australian IBV strains were sequenced, and growth properties of 6 of the strains were compared. Comparison of sequences of the genes coding for structural and nonstructural proteins revealed the existence of two IBV genotypes: classical and novel. The genomic organization of the classical IBVs was typical of those of other group III coronaviruses: 5'-Pol-S-3a-3b-E-M-5a-5b-N-untranslated region (UTR)-3'. However, the novel IBV genotype lacked either all or most of the genes coding for nonstructural proteins at the 3' end of the genome and had a unique open reading frame, X1. The gene order was either 5'-Pol-S-X1-E-M-N-UTR-3' or 5'-Pol-S-X1-E-M-5b-N-UTR-3'. Phenotypically, novel and classical IBVs also differed; novel IBVs grew at a slower rate and reached lower titers in vitro and in vivo and were markedly less immunogenic in chicks. Although the novel IBVs induced histopathological lesions in the tracheas of infected chicks that were comparable to those induced by classical strains, they did not induce lesions in the kidneys. This study has demonstrated for the first time the existence of a naturally occurring IBV genotype devoid of some of the genes coding for nonstructural proteins and has also indicated that all of the accessory genes are dispensable for the growth of IBV and that such viruses are able to cause clinical disease and economic loss. The phylogenic differences between these novel IBVs and other avian coronaviruses suggest a reservoir host distinct from domestic poultry.","Mardani, Karim; Noormohammadi, Amir H; Hooper, Peter; Ignjatovic, Jagoda; Browning, Glenn F",Journal of virology,22,28

The HCV genome is approximately 9.6 kb in length and encodes a polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved to generate at least 10 mature viral protein products. Recently, a new protein, named F, has been described to be expressed through a ribosomal frameshift within the capsid-encoding sequence, a mechanism unique among members of the family Flavidiridae: Here, expression of the F protein was investigated in an in vitro transcription/translation assay. Its expression in mammalian cells was confirmed using specific recombinant vaccinia viruses; under these conditions, protein expression is dependent on the HCV IRES. The F protein was tagged with firefly luciferase or the Myc epitope to facilitate its identification. Ribosomal frameshifting was dependent on the presence of mutations in the capsid-encoding sequence. No frameshifting was detected in the absence of any mutation. Furthermore, analysis of the F protein in time-course experiments revealed that the protein is very unstable and that its production can be stabilized by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Finally, indirect immunofluorescence studies have localized the F protein in the cytoplasm, with notable perinuclear detection.","Roussel, Juliette; Pillez, André; Montpellier, Claire; Duverlie, Gilles; Cahour, Annie; Dubuisson, Jean; Wychowski, Czeslaw",The Journal of general virology,22,17

Forehead sensors using reflectance technology might be useful in these circumstances. We hypothesized that reflectance SpO(2) would be more accurate than finger SpO(2) in patients with severe shock. METHODS A prospective observational study was conducted in an intensive care unit of a university hospital of patients in shock who were treated with high norepinephrine and/or epinephrine doses (≥0.1 μg kg(-1) min(-1)). When blood gas determinations were requested, forehead SpO(2) and finger SpO(2) values were simultaneous recorded. Agreement between SpO(2) measurements with arterial saturation (SaO(2)), obtained by blood analysis with a co-oximeter, was assessed using the Bland-Altman method. The number of outliers, defined by the formula SaO(2) - SpO(2) > ±3 %, indicated the proportion of measurements considered to be clinically unacceptable. RESULTS Thirty-two patients were enrolled in the study. With the forehead sensor no reading failure occurred, and 140 paired data sets (forehead SpO(2) vs. SaO(2)) were obtained. Bias and precision were +1.0 and +2.5 %, respectively, and the limits of agreement ranged from -4.0 to 6.0 %. The finger sensor failed to give a value in four cases, thus providing 136 paired data sets (finger SpO(2) vs. SaO(2)) for analysis. Bias and precision were +1.4 and +4.8 %, respectively, and the limits of agreement ranged from -8.0 to 10.9 %. There were 21 (15 %) outliers for the forehead sensor and 43 (32 %) for the finger sensor (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Forehead SpO(2) measurements were more accurate than finger SpO(2) when compared with SaO(2) in critically ill patients requiring high-dose vasopressor therapy and should therefore be the preferred method considered.","Nesseler, Nicolas; Frénel, Jean-Vincent; Launey, Yoann; Morcet, Jeff; Mallédant, Yannick; Seguin, Philippe",Intensive care medicine,22,1

METHODS 258 discharged SARS patients received regular SARS-Co virus IgG test, lung function test and chest X-ray and/or high resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) examination at General Hospital of PLA two months after discharge, and the treatment data of these patients were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS 80.6% patients (208 of 258 patients) were positive for SARS-Co virus IgG. 21.3% patients (55 of 258 patients) showed lung diffusion abnormity (D(LCO) < 80%pred). Compared to 155 SARS-Co virus IgG positive patients without lung diffusion abnormity and 50 SARS-Co virus IgG negative patients, the 53 SARS-Co virus IgG positive patients with lung diffusion abnormity had longer fever course, higher dosages of glucocorticoid therapy, higher percentage of oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation. 51 of the 53 patients with lung diffusion abnormity received lung function test after one month, and the results of D(LCO) improved in 80.4% patients (41 of 51 patients). 40 of 51 patients with lung diffusion abnormity showed lung fibrosis, and the fibrosis decreased in 55% patients (22 of 40 patients) after one month.

We explored the impacts of the Covid-19 lockdown and relevant vulnerabilities on capability well-being, mental health and social support in Austria. METHODS: Adult Austrian residents (n = 560) provided responses to a cross-sectional online survey about their experiences during Covid-19 lockdown (15 March-15 April 2020). Instruments measuring capabilities (OxCAP-MH), depression and anxiety (HADS), social support (MSPSS) and mental well-being (WHO-5) were used in association with six pre-defined vulnerabilities using multivariable linear regression. RESULTS: 31% of the participants reported low mental well-being and only 30% of those with a history of mental health treatment received treatment during lockdown. Past mental health treatment had a significant negative effect across all outcome measures with an associated capability well-being score reduction of - 6.54 (95%CI, - 9.26, - 3.82). Direct Covid-19 experience and being 'at risk' due to age and/or physical health conditions were also associated with significant capability deprivations. When adjusted for vulnerabilities, significant capability reductions were observed in association with increased levels of depression (- 1.77) and anxiety (- 1.50), and significantly higher capability levels (+ 3.75) were associated with higher levels of social support. Compared to the cohort average, individual capability impacts varied between - 9% for those reporting past mental health treatment and + 5% for those reporting one score higher on the social support scale. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to assess the capability limiting aspects of lockdown and relevant vulnerabilities alongside their impacts on mental health and social support. The negative capability well-being, mental health and social support impacts of the Covid-19 lockdown were strongest for people with a history of mental health treatment. Future public health policies concerning lockdowns should pay special attention to improve social support levels in order to increase public resilience.","Simon, Judit; Helter, Timea M; White, Ross G; van der Boor, Catharina; Laszewska, Agata",BMC Public Health,22,20

At the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender, women of color may be disadvantaged in terms of COVID-19 outcomes due to their role as essential workers, higher prevalence of pre-existing conditions, increased stress and anxiety from loss of wages and caregiving, and domestic violence. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence of COVID-19 outcomes, stressors, fear, and prevention behaviors among adult women residing in the United States. METHODS: Between May and June 2020, women were recruited into The COPE Study, a web-based cross-sectional study, using advertisements on Facebook; 491 eligible women completed a self-administered internet-based cross-sectional survey. Descriptive statistics were used to examine racial and ethnic differences (White; Asian; Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; Black; Hispanic, Latina or Spanish Origin; American Indian or Alaskan Native; Multiracial or some other race, ethnicity, or origin) on COVID-19 outcomes, stressors, fear, and prevention behaviors. RESULTS: Among our sample of women, 16% (73/470) reported COVID-19 symptoms, 22% (18/82) were concerned about possible exposure from the people they knew who tested positive for COVID-19, and 51.4% (227/442) knew where to get tested; yet only 5.8% (27/469) had been tested. Racial/ethnic differences were observed, with racial/ethnic minority women being less likely to know where to get tested. Significant differences in race/ethnicity were observed for select stressors (food insecurity, not enough money, homeschooling children, unable to have a doctor/telemedicine appointment) and prevention behaviors (handwashing with soap, self-isolation if sick, public glove use, not leaving home for any activities). Although no racial/ethnic differences emerged for the fear of COVID-19 scale, significant racial/ethnic differences were observed for some of the individual scale items (e.g., being afraid of getting COVID-19, sleep loss and heart racing due to worrying about COVID-19). CONCLUSIONS: Low prevalence of COVID-19 testing and knowledge of where to get tested indicate a critical need to expand testing for women in the U.S., particularly among racial/ethnic minority women. Although overall prevalence of engagement in prevention behaviors was high, targeted education and promotion of prevention activities is warranted in communities of color, particularly with consideration for stressors and adverse mental health.","Stockman, Jamila K; Wood, Brittany A; Anderson, Katherine M",J. med. internet res,22,14

However, the effects of IL-38 in viral pneumonia remains unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that circulating IL-38 concentrations together with IL-36&#945; increased significantly in influenza and COVID-19 patients, and the level of IL-38 and IL-36&#945; correlated negatively and positively with disease severity and inflammation, respectively. In the co-cultured human respiratory epithelial cells with macrophages to mimic lung microenvironment in vitro, IL-38 was able to alleviate inflammatory responses by inhibiting poly(I:C)-induced overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines through intracellular STAT1, STAT3, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, MEK, and NF-&#954;B signaling pathways. Intriguingly, transcriptomic profiling revealed that IL-38 targeted genes were associated with the host innate immune response to virus. We also found that IL-38 counteracts the biological processes induced by IL-36&#945; in the co-culture. Furthermore, the administration of recombinant IL-38 could mitigate poly I:C-induced lung injury, with reduced early accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, activation of lymphocytes, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and permeability of the alveolar-epithelial barrier. Taken together, our study indicates that IL-38 plays a crucial role in protection from exaggerated pulmonary inflammation during poly(I:C)-induced pneumonia, thereby providing the basis of a novel therapeutic target for respiratory viral infections.","Gao, Xun; Chan, Paul Kay Sheung; Lui, Grace Chung Yan; Hui, David Shu Cheong; Chu, Ida Miu-Ting; Sun, Xiaoyu; Tsang, Miranda Sin-Man; Chan, Ben Chung Lap; Lam, Christopher Wai-Kei; Wong, Chun-Kwok",Cell Death Dis,22,14

METHODS: We review the data of children who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 for a suspected infection. We compared the clinical characteristics of the subjects who tested positive and negative, including the sensibility, positive and negative predictive value of different combination of signs and symptoms. RESULTS: Of all the suspected infected, 2596 tested negative (96.2%) and 103 tested positive (3.8%). The median age was 7.0 and 5.3 years for the positive and negative ones, respectively. The female to male ratio was ~1:1.3. Fever and respiratory symptoms were mostly reported. Most positive children had a prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects (59.2%). A total of 99.3% of patients without fever nor exposure to the virus proved negative to the SARS-CoV-2 test. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that a child without fever or contact with infected subjects is SARS-CoV-2 negative. If this were to be confirmed, many resources would be spared, with improved care of both COVID-19 and not COVID-19-affected children. IMPACT: Key message: lack of fever and exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected people highly predicts a negative results of the SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab in the paediatric population. Added value to the current literature: this is the first article to prove this point. IMPACT: reduction of emergency department accesses of children with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection; increased outpatient management of children with cough or other common respiratory symptoms of infancy; sparing of many human and material health resources.","Roversi, Marco; Raucci, Umberto; Pontrelli, Giuseppe; Ranno, Stefania; Ambrosi, Michela; Torelli, Antonio; Pisani, Mara; Coltella, Luana; Piccioni, Livia; Colagrossi, Luna; Agosta, Marilena; Scialanga, Barbara; Reale, Antonino; Perno, Carlo Federico; Rossi, Paolo; Villani, Alberto",Pediatr. res,22,10

Capitalising on their colour-tuneable behaviour (in the sense that they adopt different colours with respect to the incident radiation), C-dot-based compositions are ideal for the visual enhancement of latent fingerprints, affording improved contrast against multicoloured and patterned backgrounds. As highly sensitive and highly selective optical nanoprobes, C-dots show excellent analytical performance in detecting biological compounds, drugs, explosives, heavy metals and poisonous reactants. In addition, benefiting from their versatile structural and chemical composition, C-dots can be incorporated into ink and polymeric formulations capable of functioning as a new generation of cost-effective barcodes and security nanotags for object authentication and anti-counterfeit applications.

BACKGROUND: As hospitals adjust staffing patterns to meet the demands of the pandemic, nurses have direct physical contact with ill patients, placing themselves and their families at physical and emotional risk. METHODS: From June to August 2020, semi-structured interviews were conducted. Sixteen nurses caring for COVID-19 patients during the first surge of the pandemic were selected via purposive sampling. Participants worked in ICUs of a quaternary 1,000-bed hospital in the Northeast United States. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, identifiers were removed, and data were coded thematically. RESULTS: Our exploratory study identified four themes that describe the experiences of nurses providing care to patients in COVID-19 ICUs during the first surge: (a) challenges of working with new co-workers and teams, (b) challenges of maintaining existing working relationships, (c) role of nursing leadership in providing information and maintaining morale and (d) the importance of institutional-level acknowledgement of their work. CONCLUSIONS: As the pandemic continues, hospitals should implement nursing staffing models that maintain and strengthen existing relationships to minimize exhaustion and burnout.

Antrodia cinnamomea (AC), a well-known Chinese folk medicine in Taiwan, possesses numerous biological capabilities, most notably an anti-tumor effect. However, the clinical use of AC as complementary medicine combined with adjuvant therapy is unexplored. In this case report, we evaluated AC combined with PAL plus FUL to reduce the tumor burden in an MBC patient. PATIENT CONCERNS: A Slovenian woman diagnosed with relapsed bone metastases of breast cancer (BC) was unable to undergo surgery and refused radiation therapy due to fear of side effects; she also feared the side effects of adjuvants. However, she was eager to live with a high quality of life. DIAGNOSIS: Stage IV, HR-positive/HER2-negative BC with relapse of bone metastases. INTERVENTIONS: After diagnosis of relapse of bone metastases, she received adjuvant with PAL plus FUL. Additionally, she chose to take AC orally (10âg/d). OUTCOMES: The pain was mostly relieved, and the side effects of adjuvant therapy reduced. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed reduction of tumor size at the fifth month of adjuvant therapy plus AC. After 14 months of adjuvant therapy plus AC, the tumors at the thoracic vertebrae T1 and T3 were found to have shrunk from 35.2 and 12.0âmm to 28.1 and 9.9âmm, respectively. Remarkably, no further metastases were observed. LESSONS: According to the circulating tumor cells (CTCs) test data, AC had better anti-tumor efficacy on active tumor cells than PAL plus FUL. Thus, AC could be an effective complementary medicine for adjuvant therapy in patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative MBC. Interestingly, continued elevation of carcinoma antigen 15-3 and lactate dehydrogenase levels but decreasing levels of alkaline phosphatase were observed, which may be indicative of the potent efficacy of treatment resulting in massive tumor cell death. The CTCs test may be a sensitive approach to monitor the progression of BC and subsequently evaluate the efficiency of therapy.","Long, Huei; Hu, Chi-Tan; Prijatelj, Vesna; Weng, Ching-Feng",Medicine (Baltimore),22,29

In order to evaluate the comparative barrier performance effect of face masks and face shields, we used an aerosol generator and a particle counter to evaluate the performance of the various devices in comparable situations. We tested different configurations in an experimental setup with manikin heads wearing masks (surgical type I), face shields (22.5 cm high with overhang under the chin of 7 cm and circumference of 35 cm) on an emitter or a receiver manikin head, or both. The manikins were face to face, 25 cm apart, with an intense particle emission (52.5 L/min) for 30 s. The particle counter calculated the total cumulative particles aspirated on a volume of 1.416 L In our experimental conditions, when the receiver alone wore a protection, the face shield was more effective (reduction factor = 54.8%), while reduction was lower with a mask (reduction factor = 21.8%) (p = 0.002). The wearing of a protective device by the emitter alone reduced the level of received particles by 96.8% for both the mask and face shield (p = NS). When both the emitter and receiver manikin heads wore a face shield, the protection allowed for better results in our experimental conditions: 98% reduction for the face shields versus 97.3% for the masks (p = 0.01). Face shields offered an even better barrier effect than the mask against small inhaled particles (<0.3 µm-0.3 to 0.5 µm-0.5 to 1 µm) in all configurations. Therefore, it would be interesting to include face shields as used in our experimental study as part of strategies to reduce transmission within the community setting.","Wendling, Jean-Michel; Fabacher, Thibaut; Pébaÿ, Philippe-Pierre; Cosperec, Isabelle; Rochoy, Michaël",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),22,16

In order to avoid unnecessary contact between medical staff, virtual medical boards were implemented. METHODS: Technical requirements for virtual boards were established overnight. Standard web cams and one license for a licensed provider of virtual boards were acquired. Most of the other technical gear required was readily available. Frequent and typical errors during the virtual boards were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Virtual boards provided the means for adequate patient care in spite of social distancing among the medical staff. Over a period of 4 weeks, 956 face-to-face contacts were avoided. Most errors occurred during first-time participation and concerned audio transmission. By muting the microphone of inactive participants, most of these errors could be avoided. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual boards for medical staff can be implemented with minimal effort und standard technical gear to slow down the transmission of coronavirus among medical professionals in the hospital setting.","König, Tatjana Tamara; Lenz, Anna-Franziska; Goedeke, Jan; Muensterer, Oliver J",Gesundheitswesen,22,16

However, the consequences of widespread use of these unprecedented measures are poorly understood. To contribute to the understanding of the economic and human consequences of such policy measures, we therefore construct a mathematical model of an economy under the impact of a pandemic, select parameter values to represent the global economy under the impact of COVID-19, and perform numerical experiments by simulating a large number of possible policy responses. By varying the starting date of the policy intervention in the simulated scenarios, we find that the most effective policy intervention occurs around the time when the number of active infections is growing at its highest rate. The degree of the intervention, above a certain threshold, does not appear to have a great impact on the outcomes in our simulations, due to the strongly concave relationship we assume between production shortfall and reduction in the infection rate. Our experiments further suggest that the intervention should last until after the peak determined by the reduced infection rate. The model and its implementation, along with the general insights from our policy experiments, may help policymakers design effective emergency policy responses in the face a serious pandemic, and contribute to our understanding of the relationship between the economic growth and the spread of infectious diseases.","Trotter, Ian M.; Schmidt, Lu'is A.

With an estimated incidence of 2/100,000 children, MIS-C is relatively rare, but can be fatal. Clinical features can include fever, hyperinflammatory state, gastrointestinal symptoms, myocardial dysfunction, and shock. The pathogenesis of MIS-C, although yet to be completely elucidated, appears to be distinct from KD in terms of epidemiology, severity, and biochemical signature. Methods: This comprehensive review searched AMED, EBM Reviews, Embase, Healthstar, MEDLINE, ERIC, and Cochrane for studies that reported treatments and outcomes of MIS-C. Results: The search strategy yielded 42 papers, from which 15 underwent full-text review (nâ¯=â¯386). A majority of children received intravenous immunoglobulin (77%) and some form of anticoagulation (63%). Steroid use was also common (44%), with immunotherapy used only in severe cases (nâ¯=â¯72). Outcomes reported included PICU admission (77%), need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (5%), and mortality (1.3%). Although efficacy of treatments for MIS-C have largely not yet been investigated, we propose close monitoring by a multidisciplinary team, symptomatic treatment (e.g., intravenous immunoglobulin for KD-like symptoms, steroids/immunotherapy for multisystem inflammation), and long-term follow-up. Conclusion: Although outcomes are largely favorable, management is based on a different disease entity (KD), which may not be appropriate given the likely pathophysiologic divergences. Further research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of current MIS-C treatments and to determine more refined therapies.","Kiss, Andreea; Ryan, Paul MacDaragh; Mondal, Tapas",Prog Pediatr Cardiol,22,1

The health-care employees are the frontline soldiers to fight against COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, there is a lack of research regarding the conceptualisation of COVID-19 and its impact on health-care employees' well-being and their organisational sustainability. Extending the role of responsible leadership (RL), the purpose of this paper is to develop a multi-level conceptual model to overcome the crisis of COVID-19 pandemic and promote employee (e.g. workers, nurses and professionals) well-being and organisational sustainability. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: With a comprehensive literature review, this paper presents five testable propositions and highlights the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on employee well-being and organisational sustainability. FINDINGS: The proposed model counsels that organisations need to go beyond the simple application of strategic climate and should enable RL to protect and maintain employee well-being and organisational sustainability. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: The proposed conceptual model is a step forward to not only explore future empirical research but also it will help the health-care policymakers to take responsible initiatives to increase employee well-being and uphold organisational sustainability. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: There is a lack of research regarding the conceptualisation of the COVID 19 pandemic and its impact on health-care employees' well-being and organisational sustainability. The proposed conceptual model opens and guides a novel research avenue for the alignment of strategic management (as a moderator) and RL on the relationships among the COVID-19 pandemic, employee well-being and organisational sustainability.","Haque, Amlan",Leadersh Health Serv (Bradf Engl),22,10

Exponential model was used to calculate the slope of the regression line while the ARIMA model was used to calculate the initial autocorrelation slope and also to forecast new cases for both waves. The relationship between epidemiologic and CHE/GDP data was used for processing ordinary least square multivariate modeling and classifying countries into different groups using PC analysis, K-means and Hierarchical clustering; (3) ResultsResults show that some countries with high CHE/GDP improved their public health strategy against virus during the second wave of the pandemic; (4) ConclusionsResults revealed that countries who spend more on health infrastructure improved in the tackling of the pandemic in the second wave as they were worst hit in the first wave. This research will help countries to decide on how to increase their CHE/GDP in order to tackle properly other pandemic waves of the present Covid-19 outbreak and future diseases that may occur.

Furthermore, we characterized one representative IgG2 MAb, 3H9, which exhibited a strong immunoreaction to both recombinant M protein and native viral protein of SARS-CoV. We found a B-cell antigenic epitope located between amino acid 1–15 and defined the MAb recognizing region within amino acid 16–28 of M.

They may act as catalytic antioxidants mimicking both the structure and the reactivity of the native antioxidant enzymes active site. Thus, manganosalen complexes have been shown to exhibit superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities, and they could potentially facilitate the scavenging of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby restoring the redox balance in damaged cells and organs. Initial catalytic studies compared the potency of these compounds as antioxidants in terms of rate constants of the chemical reactivity against ROS, giving catalytic values approaching and even exceeding that of the native antioxidative enzymes. Although most of these catalytic studies lack of biological relevance, subsequent in vitro studies have confirmed the efficiency of many manganosalen complexes in oxidative stress models. These synthetic catalytic scavengers, cheaper than natural antioxidants, have accordingly attracted intensive attention for the therapy of ROS-mediated injuries. The aim of this review is to focus on in vivo studies performed on manganosalen complexes and their activity on the treatment of several pathological disorders associated with oxidative damage. These disorders, ranging from the prevention of fetal malformations to the extension of lifespan, include neurodegenerative, inflammatory, and cardiovascular diseases; tissue injury; and other damages related to the liver, kidney, or lungs.","Rouco, Lara; González-Noya, Ana M.; Pedrido, Rosa; Maneiro, Marcelino",Antioxidants (Basel),22,10

METHOD: We collected clinical records from 79 COVID-19 patients at Wuhan Union hospital (China). Spearman’s correlation analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Kaplan–Meier survival curves were employed. RESULTS: Patients with elevated ferritin levels had a higher incidence of severity illness (50.0 vs 2.9%) and liver injury (52.3 vs 20.0%) when compared with patients with normal ferritin levels (p < 0.05). Ferritin could effectively identify the severity of illness (ROC area 0.873) and liver injury (ROC area 0.752). The elevated ferritin group showed longer viral clearance time (median 16 vs 6 days, p < 0.001) and in-hospital length (median 18 vs 10 days, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: It suggests that ferritin could act as an easy-to-use tool to identify liver injury and severity illness and predict the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.

The practice is so pervasive that the first reaction to obtaining health information is to “Google it.” As SARS-CoV-2 broke out in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and quickly spread worldwide, people flocked to the internet to learn about the novel coronavirus and the disease, COVID-19. Lagging responses by governments and public health agencies to prioritize the dissemination of information about the coronavirus outbreak through the internet and the World Wide Web and to build trust gave room for others to quickly populate social media, online blogs, news outlets, and websites with misinformation and conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in people’s deviant behaviors toward public health safety measures. OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were to determine what people learned about the COVID-19 pandemic through web searches, examine any association between what people learned about COVID-19 and behavior toward public health guidelines, and analyze the impact of misinformation and conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic on people’s behavior toward public health measures. METHODS: This infodemiology study used Google Trends’ worldwide search index, covering the first 6 months after the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (January 1 to June 30, 2020) when the public scrambled for information about the pandemic. Data analysis employed statistical trends, correlation and regression, principal component analysis (PCA), and predictive models. RESULTS: The PCA identified two latent variables comprising past coronavirus epidemics (pastCoVepidemics: keywords that address previous epidemics) and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (presCoVpandemic: keywords that explain the ongoing pandemic). Both principal components were used significantly to learn about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and explained 88.78% of the variability. Three principal components fuelled misinformation about COVID-19: misinformation (keywords “biological weapon,” “virus hoax,” “common cold,” “COVID-19 hoax,” and “China virus”), conspiracy theory 1 (ConspTheory1; keyword “5G” or “@5G”), and conspiracy theory 2 (ConspTheory2; keyword “ingest bleach”). These principal components explained 84.85% of the variability. The principal components represent two measurements of public health safety guidelines—public health measures 1 (PubHealthMes1; keywords “social distancing,” “wash hands,” “isolation,” and “quarantine”) and public health measures 2 (PubHealthMes2; keyword “wear mask”)—which explained 84.7% of the variability. Based on the PCA results and the log-linear and predictive models, ConspTheory1 (keyword “@5G”) was identified as a predictor of people’s behavior toward public health measures (PubHealthMes2). Although correlations of misinformation (keywords “COVID-19,” “hoax,” “virus hoax,” “common cold,” and more) and ConspTheory2 (keyword “ingest bleach”) with PubHealthMes1 (keywords “social distancing,” “hand wash,” “isolation,” and more) were r=0.83 and r=–0.11, respectively, neither was statistically significant (P=.27 and P=.13, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Several studies focused on the impacts of social media and related platforms on the spreading of misinformation and conspiracy theories. This study provides the first empirical evidence to the mainly anecdotal discourse on the use of web searches to learn about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.","Akpan, Ikpe Justice; Aguolu, Obianuju Genevieve; Kobara, Yawo Mamoua; Razavi, Rouzbeh; Akpan, Asuama A; Shanker, Murali",J Med Internet Res,22,20

Apart from the unprecedented number of deaths and hospitalizations, the pandemic has resulted in economic slowdowns, widespread business disruptions, and significant hardships. This study focused on investigating the early impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. construction industry since the declaration of the national emergency on 13 March 2020. The study objectives were achieved through 34 telephone interviews with project managers, engineers, designers, and superintendents that represented different states and distinct industry sectors in the United States (U.S.). The interviewees offered information on their experience with the pandemic, including the general and adverse effects experienced, new opportunities created, and risk management efforts being undertaken. The reported adverse effects included significant delays on projects, inability to secure materials on time, reduction in productivity rates, material price escalations, and others. The new opportunities that were created included projects involving the fast-track construction of medical facilities, construction of residential buildings, transportation-related work, and opportunities to recruit skilled workers. The risk management measures that were widely adopted included measures to enhance safety and reduce other project risks. The safety measures adopted included requiring employees to wear cloth face masks, adoption of social distancing protocols, staggering of construction operations, offering COVID-19-related training, administering temperature checks prior to entry into the workplace, and others. Measures to manage other project risks included the formation of a task force team to review the evolving pandemic and offer recommendations, advocating that construction businesses be deemed essential to combat delays and taking advantage of government relief programs. The study findings will be useful to industry stakeholders interested in understanding the early impacts of the pandemic on the construction industry. Industry stakeholders may also build upon the reported findings and establish best practices for continued safe and productive operations.","Alsharef, Abdullah; Banerjee, Siddharth; Uddin, S M Jamil; Albert, Alex; Jaselskis, Edward",Int J Environ Res Public Health,22,26

A positive safety culture is associated with improved patient safety and, in turn, with patient outcomes. To date, no study has evaluated the impact of Covid-19 on safety culture. The Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) was used to investigate safety culture at a large UK healthcare trust during Covid-19. Findings were compared with baseline data from 2017. Incident reporting from the year preceding the pandemic was also examined. SAQ scores of doctors and “other clinical staff”, were relatively higher than the nursing group. During Covid-19, on univariate regression analysis, female gender, age 40–49 years, non-White ethnicity, and nursing job role were all associated with lower SAQ scores. Training and support for redeployment were associated with higher SAQ scores. On multivariate analysis, non-disclosed gender (−0.13), non-disclosed ethnicity (−0.11), nursing role (−0.15), and support (0.29) persisted to a level of significance. A significant decrease (p < 0.003) was seen in error reporting after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. This is the first study to investigate SAQ during Covid-19. Differences in SAQ scores were observed during Covid-19 between professional groups when compared to baseline. Reductions in incident reporting were also seen. These changes may reflect perception of risk, changes in volume or nature of work. High-quality support for redeployed staff may be associated with improved safety perception during future pandemics.","Denning, Max; Goh, Ee Teng; Scott, Alasdair; Martin, Guy; Markar, Sheraz; Flott, Kelsey; Mason, Sam; Przybylowicz, Jan; Almonte, Melanie; Clarke, Jonathan; Winter Beatty, Jasmine; Chidambaram, Swathikan; Yalamanchili, Seema; Tan, Benjamin Yong-Qiang; Kanneganti, Abhiram; Sounderajah, Viknesh; Wells, Mary; Purkayastha, Sanjay; Kinross, James",Int J Environ Res Public Health,22,12

SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific antibody detection is convenient, safe, and highly sensitive. IgM and IgG are commonly used to serologically diagnose COVID‐19; however, the role of IgA is not well known. We aimed to quantify the levels of SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies, identify changes in them based on COVID‐19 severity, and establish the significance of combined antibody detection. METHODS: COVID‐19 patients, divided into a severe & critical group and a moderate group, and non‐COVID‐19 patients with respiratory disease were included in this study. A chemiluminescence method was used to detect the levels of SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific IgM, IgA, and IgG in the blood samples from the three groups. Epidemiological characteristics, symptoms, blood test results, and other data were recorded for all patients. RESULTS: Compared to the traditional IgM–IgG combined antibodies, IgA–IgG combined antibodies are better for diagnosing COVID‐19. During the disease process, IgA appeared first and disappeared last. All three antibodies had significantly higher levels in COVID‐19 patients than in non‐COVID‐19 patients. IgA and IgG were also higher for severe & critical disease than for moderate disease. All antibodies were at or near low levels at the time of tracheal extubation in critical patients. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific combined IgA–IgG antibodies is advantageous in diagnosing COVID‐19. IgA detection is suitable during early and late stages of the disease. IgA and IgG levels correspond to disease severity.","Huang, Zhifeng; Chen, Hao; Xue, Mingshan; Huang, Huimin; Zheng, Peiyan; Luo, Wenting; Liang, Xueqing; Sun, Baoqing; Zhong, Nanshan",Clin Exp Immunol,22,16

Despite its many advantages, its uptake and rigorous evaluation of feasibility across neurology’s ambulatory subspecialties has been sparse. However, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted health care systems worldwide to reconsider traditional health care delivery. To safeguard health care workers and patients, many health care systems quickly transitioned to telemedicine, including across neurology subspecialties, providing a new opportunity to evaluate this modality of care. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accelerated implementation of video visits in ambulatory neurology during the COVID-19 pandemic, we used mixed methods to assess adoption, acceptability, appropriateness, and perceptions of potential sustainability. METHODS: Video visits were launched rapidly in ambulatory neurology clinics of a large academic medical center. To assess adoption, we analyzed clinician-level scheduling data collected between March 22 and May 16, 2020. We assessed acceptability, appropriateness, and sustainability via a clinician survey (n=48) and semistructured interviews with providers (n=30) completed between March and May 2020. RESULTS: Video visits were adopted rapidly; overall, 65 (98%) clinicians integrated video visits into their workflow within the first 6 implementation weeks and 92% of all visits were conducted via video. Video visits were largely considered acceptable by clinicians, although various technological issues impacted their satisfaction. Video visits were reported to be more convenient for patients, families, and caregivers than in-person visits; however, access to technology, the patient’s technological capacity, and language difficulties were considered barriers. Many clinicians expressed optimism about future utilization of video visits in neurology. They believed that video visits promote continuity of care and can be incorporated into their practice long-term, although several insisted that they can never replace the in-person examination. CONCLUSIONS: Video visits are an important addition to clinical care in ambulatory neurology and are anticipated to remain a permanent supplement to in-person visits, promoting patient care continuity, and flexibility for patients and clinicians alike.","Saliba-Gustafsson, Erika A; Miller-Kuhlmann, Rebecca; Kling, Samantha M R; Garvert, Donn W; Brown-Johnson, Cati G; Lestoquoy, Anna Sophia; Verano, Mae-Richelle; Yang, Laurice; Falco-Walter, Jessica; Shaw, Jonathan G; Asch, Steven M; Gold, Carl A; Winget, Marcy",J Med Internet Res,22,20

Its high mutation rate in conjunction with recombination of the RNA genome constantly creates IBV variants that are difficult to control by currently available vaccines. In this study, we addressed the question whether small-scale holdings might harbor IBV variants that serve as a reservoir for newly emerging variants. Egyptian IBV isolate EGY/NR725/2016 (NR725/16) from a small-scale broiler farm was assigned to genotype I, clade 23 (S1:GI-23), based on partial S1 gene sequences and corroborated by full genome sequencing. Analysis of the S1 gene established three subclades for historical IBV strains (S1:GI-23.1, S1:GI-23.2.1 and S1:GI-23.2.2) and confirmed NR725/16 as being part of a separate fourth subclade (S1:GI-23.3). Samples from the years 2018 and 2019 revealed that the new subclade prevails in Egypt, carrying fixed mutations within the hypervariable regions (HVR) 1-3 of the S1 protein that affect two neutralization sensitive epitopes at sites 294F, 297S and 306Y (48.2) and 329R (62.1). In addition, recombination was recognized in isolate NR 725/16, with intra-subtype mixing for the entire genes 3ab and E and inter-subtype mixing for the entire gene 6b with a close match to QX like viruses of genotype GI-19. Further analysis of gene 3ab detected the homologous gene pool to NR725/16 in samples from 2013 (3ab:C) and closely related 3ab genotypes in IBV Egyptian isolates from 2016, 2018 and 2019. These data prove a flourishing exchange between poultry holdings with a common gene pool. The continued circulation of viruses harboring genes S1:GI-23.3 and 3ab:C indicates an evolutionary advantage of this combination possibly by combining antigenic escape with modulated pathogenicity to facilitate IBV spread in the vaccinated poultry population in Egypt.","Moharam, Ibrahim; Sultan, Hesham; Hassan, Kareem; Ibrahim, Mahmoud; Shany, Salama; Shehata, Awad A.; Abo-ElKhair, Mohammed; Pfaff, Florian; Höper, Dirk; EL Kady, Magdy; Beer, Martin; Harder, Timm; Hafez, Hafez; Grund, Christian",Infect Genet Evol,22,14

As etiological factor a virus belonging to the coronavirus family was isolated. This virus was named SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. This virus can cause different clinical frames, variating from mild symptomatology to cases of ARDS or death. Although the pandemic outbroke in China, COVID-19 had one of first hotspots in Italy, where the Public Health System needed a re-arrangement to face the disease. The incidence of oncological disease doesn’t suffer any variation in relation to pandemics or emergency period, but need to be managed as soon as possible in every situation. In our maxillo-facial surgery Unit we continued our regular activities to treat all oncological patient that needed surgery during the pandemic. Because of the absence of knowledge about the COVID-19, first periods were very difficult to manage, due to the risk of infection of patients and health professionals. We decided to share our experience. Materials and Methods Between March and June 2020, 34 patients affected by head and neck cancer were admitted at our Unit. All patients underwent surgical treatment and were hospitalized until their situation guaranteed a safe discharge. Results All patients treated for head and neck cancer underwent surgery. All the medical and nurse post-operative management was performed by health operators by using all the personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent any possible infection. All contacts between patients and their family were suspended. During phase 1, all patients were submitted to a short verbal triage, measurements of physiological parameters and qualitative COVID-19 test. They were also screened by imaging to guarantee there were not any bronchopulmonary diseases referable to viral infections. During phase 2, patients were also screened by serological tests. During phase 3, all patients practiced oropharyngeal swap before being hospitalized. Discussion During lockdown a re-arrangement of the management of oncological patients was mandatory. The difficulties were caused by the restriction of several activities that guarantee a normal health care system function. To date there is not a standardized therapeutic protocol to face the infection. Main therapies are symptomatic and a lot of patients need to be treated in ICUs. To prevent any possible infections, surgical activities were reserved only for urgent disease that cannot be delayed. In our Unit we continued to manage oncological patients. Social distancing and confinement measures were necessary and mandatory, in order to manage our patients. During first phases we had not any valid instrument to totally exclude COVID-19 infection. During phase 3, when oropharyngeal swaps were introduced in the screening of our patients, we could start to work in a safer way. Conclusion There are still a lot of difficulties in the management of patients during COVID 19 pandemic. Because of the important consequences deriving from the delay of oncological patients their management must to be clearly defined.","Bonavolontà, Paola; Dell’Aversana Orabona, Giovanni; Sorrentino, Alfonso; Abbate, Vincenzo; Goglia, Federica; Pasquale, Piombino; Iaconetta, Giorgio; Califano, Luigi",,22,12

During that time, it had developed highly effective strategies to cope with novel pathogenic challenges and retain immune “memory” following pathogen clearance. We found surprising parallels between person-level immune responses to the virus causing COVID-19 and the society-level responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, the events which lead to a life-endangering immune cytokine storm, parallel those leading to a devastating socioeconomic crisis we termed a “social cytokine storm”. This new understanding may help explain why COVID-19, caused by a virus with no “exceptional” epidemiological capabilities, had inflicted such profound social and global toll. Understanding the set of events leading to an immunological and societal cytokine storms may aid scientists and policymakers to adopt more effective strategies that could reduce future disease morbidity and mortality, avert avoidable social cytokine storms, and minimize the socioeconomic toll. ABSTRACT: The adaptive immune system was sculpted to protect individuals, societies, and species since its inception, developing effective strategies to cope with emerging pathogens. Here, we show that similar successful or failed dynamics govern personal and societal responses to a pathogen as SARS-CoV2. Understanding the self-similarity between the health-protective measures taken to protect the individual or the society, help identify critical factors underlying the effectiveness of societal response to a pathogenic challenge. These include (1) the quick employment of adaptive-like, pathogen-specific strategies to cope with the threat including the development of “memory-like responses”; (2) enabling productive coaction and interaction within the society by employing effective decision-making processes; and (3) the quick inhibition of positive feedback loops generated by hazardous or false information. Learning from adaptive anti-pathogen immune responses, policymakers and scientists could reduce the direct damages associated with COVID-19 and avert an avoidable “social cytokine storm” with its ensuing socioeconomic damage.","Lev-Ari, Shahar; Rolnik, Benjamin; Volovitz, Ilan",Biology (Basel),22,24

Conventional approaches to analyse microbiome data typically entail dimensionality reduction and assume linearity of the observed relationships, however, the microbiome is a highly complex ecosystem marked by non-linear relationships. In this study, we use topological data analysis (TDA) to explore differences and similarities between the gut microbiome across several countries. Methods: We used curated adult microbiome data at the genus level from the GMrepo database. The dataset contains OTU and demographical data of over 4,400 samples from 19 studies, spanning 12 countries. We analysed the data with tmap, an integrative framework for TDA specifically designed for stratification and enrichment analysis of population-based gut microbiome datasets. Results: We find associations between specific microbial genera and groups of countries. Specifically, both the USA and UK were significantly co-enriched with the proinflammatory genera Lachnoclostridium and Ruminiclostridium, while France and New Zealand were co-enriched with other, butyrate-producing, taxa of the order Clostridiales. Conclusion: The TDA approach demonstrates the overlap and distinctions of microbiome composition between and within countries. This yields unique insights into complex associations in the dataset, a finding not possible with conventional approaches. It highlights the potential utility of TDA as a complementary tool in microbiome research, particularly for large population-scale datasets, and suggests further analysis on the effects of diet and other regionally varying factors.","Lymberopoulos, Eva; Gentili, Giorgia Isabella; Alomari, Muhannad; Sharma, Nikhil",Front Artif Intell,22,1

This has resulted in a lack of reliable information about the patterns of psychological distress within the population, which is a barrier to the development of effective and appropriate mental health services. The aim of the study was to develop a locally-appropriate measure of psychological distress for Sierra Leone. METHODS: The new measure consists of two instruments: the Sierra Leone Psychological Distress Scale (SLPDS) and a gendered measure of ability to carry out daily tasks—a Function scale—as an indication of the severity of distress. A three-phase mixed methods exploratory sequential study was conducted. Phase 1 was item generation and testing, leading to the development of a set of potential items for both instruments. Phase 2 was a small pilot study (N = 202) leading to the selection of the final set of items for both measures. Phase 3 was a validation phase where the SLPDS and the Function scale were administered with a larger sample of 904 respondents. Item analysis was used to assess the internal consistency of the scales, and Exploratory Factor Analysis to explore the properties of the SLPDS. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis using the principal axis factoring with an oblique rotation identified a three-factor structure for the 18-item SLPDS. Internal consistency for the SLPDS (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89) and three subscales was good (Cronbach’s alpha > 0.73). The internal reliability of the male and female versions of the Function scale was also found to be acceptable (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.90 for the female scale and 0.79 for the male scale). CONCLUSIONS: Together the SLPD and Function scales provide a locally-validated tool which will enable government bodies and local and international non-governmental organisations in Sierra Leone to assess mental health and psychosocial needs. This will support both effective service provision and the evaluation of initiatives designed to improve mental health and psychosocial wellbeing.

The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the sequence similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with other SARS-like bat viruses. The primary source and intermediate host are not yet confirmed, although transmission from human to human is universally confirmed. The new SARS-CoV-2 virus reaches cells via ACE-2 and subsequently down-regulates ACE-2, leaving angiotensin II unbalanced in affected organs primarily in the lungs, heart, brain, and kidneys. As reported recently, numerous secondary complications i.e., neurological, nephrological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, immune, and hepatic complications, are associated with COVID-19 infection along with prominent respiratory disease including pneumonia. Extensive research work on recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 is in the pipeline to clarify pathogenic mechanisms, epidemiological features, and identify new drug targets that will lead to the development of successful strategies for prevention and treatment. There are currently no appropriate scientifically approved vaccines/drugs for COVID-19. Nonetheless, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, azithromycin were tested against COVID-19 in clinical trials, and finally, FDA approved emergency use of remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Additionally, administration of convalescent plasma obtained from recovered COVID-19 patients to infected COVID-19 patients reduces the viral burden via immunomodulation. This review analysis therefore concentrates primarily on recent discoveries related to COVID-19 pathogenesis along with a full description of the structure, genome, and secondary complication associated with SARS-CoV-2.

We invited Lena, a university student who believed she had constant internal monologue, to participate in a DES analog of a pre-registered study: We would announce, on the Internet, that we would conduct a fully transparent DES investigation and roll out videos of the DES interviews (and annotated transcripts) as they occurred in (almost) real-time, something like “reality TV about inner experience,” so that spectators could examine for themselves our characterizations of Lena and how we arrived at them. We describe here the procedure and its findings: Lena did not have frequent internal monologue (contrary to her expectations); she did have frequent visual imagery (to her surprise); and we speculated about the frequent presence of two simultaneous “centers of gravity” of her experience. The entire procedure is available for inspection.","Krumm, Alek E.; Hurlburt, Russell T.",Phenomenol Cogn Sci,22,28

Therefore, this study aimed to explore barriers to implementing an integrated One Health surveillance system in Palestine. METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted from April 2020 until August 2020. Data were collected using semi-structured interview guides. Seven key stakeholders were interviewed during data collection. A thematic analysis was performed. RESULTS: Four overarching themes emerged explaining barriers to integrated implementation of the One Health surveillance system. They are lack of policy coherence, limited financial resources, poor governance and leadership, and lack of One Health training programmes. CONCLUSION: Improved understanding of the transmission and effective control (including One Health approach) of zoonotic disease and better governance and leadership are critical in the diseases that threaten public health, such as the COVID-19.","Abuzerr, Samer; Zinszer, Kate; Assan, Abraham",SAGE Open Med,22,24

We describe a rare form of interstitial and organizing pneumonia resembling COVID-19, emphasizing some key aspects to focus on to get the right diagnosis and treat the patient properly. CASE PRESENTATION: A 76-year-old man presented with short breath and dry cough in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak. He showed bilateral crackles and interstitial-alveolar opacities on X-ray, corresponding on computed tomography (CT) to extensive consolidations with air bronchograms, surrounded by ground glass opacities (GGO). Although his throat-and-nasopharyngeal swab tested negative, the picture was overall compatible with COVID-19. On the other hand, he showed subacute, rather than hyperacute, clinical onset; few and stable parenchymal consolidations, rather than patchy and rapidly evolving GGO; pleural and pericardial thickening, pleural effusion, and lymph node enlargement, usually absent in COVID-19; and peripheral eosinophilia, rather than lymphopenia, suggestive of hypersensitivity. In the past year, he had been taking amiodarone for a history of ventricular ectopic beats. CT scans, in fact, highlighted hyperattenuation areas suggestive of amiodarone pulmonary accumulation and toxicity. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) investigation confirmed the absence of coronavirus genome in the lower respiratory tract; conversely, high numbers of foamy macrophages, eosinophils, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes with low CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio were detected, confirming the hypothesis of amiodarone-induced cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Timely discontinuation of amiodarone and initiation of steroid therapy led to resolution of respiratory symptoms, systemic inflammation, and radiographic opacities. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive analysis of medical and pharmacological history, clinical onset, radiologic details, and peripheral and BALF cellularity, is required for a correct differential diagnosis and management of ILDs in the COVID-19 era.","Zizzo, Gaetano; Caruso, Stefano; Ricchiuti, Elisabetta; Turato, Roberto; Stefani, Ilario; Mazzone, Antonino",Eur J Med Res,22,1

With the United States leading the path in terms of case incidence, it is important to investigate how weather variables influence the spread of the disease in the country. This paper assembles a detailed and comprehensive dataset comprising COVID-19 cases and climatological variables for all counties in the continental U.S. and uses a developed econometric approach to estimate the causal effect of certain weather factors on the growth rate of infection. The results indicate a non-linear and significant negative relationship between the individual weather measures and the growth rate of COVID-19 in the U.S. Specifically, the paper finds that a 1 °C rise in daily temperature will reduce daily covid growth rate in the U.S. by approximately 6 percent in the following week, while a marginal increase in relative humidity reduces the same outcome by 1 percent over a similar period. In comparison, a 1 m/s increase in daily wind speed will bring about an 8 percent drop in daily growth rate of COVID-19 in the country. These results differ by location and are robust to several sensitivity checks, so large deviations are unexpected.","Emediegwu, Lotanna E.",J Environ Manage,22,2

Despite its benefits in suppressing the spread of the virus, publicizing contact trace data raises concerns about individuals' privacy. In view of this tug-of-war between one's privacy and public safety, this work aims to deepen the understanding of privacy risks of contact trace data disclosure practices in South Korea. Method: In this study, publicly available contact trace data of 970 confirmed patients were collected from seven metropolitan cities in South Korea (20th Jan–20th Apr 2020). Then, an ordinal scale of relative privacy risk levels was introduced for evaluation, and the assessment was performed on the personal information included in the contact trace data, such as demographics, significant places, sensitive information, social relationships, and routine behaviors. In addition, variance of privacy risk levels was examined across regions and over time to check for differences in policy implementation. Results: It was found that most of the contact trace data showed the gender and age of the patients. In addition, it disclosed significant places (home/work) ranging across different levels of privacy risks in over 70% of the cases. Inference on sensitive information (hobby, religion) was made possible, and 48.7% of the cases exposed the patient's social relationships. In terms of regional differences, a considerable discrepancy was found in the privacy risk for each category. Despite the recent release of government guidelines on data disclosure, its effects were still limited to a few factors (e.g., workplaces, routine behaviors). Discussion: Privacy risk assessment showed evidence of superfluous information disclosure in the current practice. This study discusses the role of “identifiability” in contact tracing to provide new directions for minimizing disclosure of privacy infringing information. Analysis of real-world data can offer potential stakeholders, such as researchers, service developers, and government officials with practical protocols/guidelines in publicizing information of patients and design implications for future systems (e.g., automatic privacy sensitivity checking) to strike a balance between one's privacy and the public benefits with data disclosure.","Jung, Gyuwon; Lee, Hyunsoo; Kim, Auk; Lee, Uichin",Front Public Health,22,27

Not much literature is available regarding the effect of COVID-19 on LFTs in patients without preexisting liver disease. The study aimed to find the effect of COVID-19 in these patients. Methods: This was a single-center, observational study with 142 patients who were admitted with COVID-19 during three months. Seven patients were excluded due to the presence of chronic liver disease. Results: A total of 135 patients were included in the study aged between 18 and 95 years (mean 57.7 ± 15.6); among them, 93 were males (68.9%). Hypertension was present in 74 patients (54.8%), and diabetes was present in 48 patients (35.6%). Fever was the chief complaint in 112 patients (83%), followed by dyspnea in 93 patients (68.9%) and cough in 79 patients (58.5%). Elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was seen in 35 patients (26%), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) in 43 patients (32%), alanine transaminase (ALT) in 18 patients (24%), alkaline phosphatase in 19 patients (14%), bilirubin in six patients (4%), and low albumin in 27 patients (20%). Severe COVID-19, when compared with mild to moderate disease, was associated with elevated AST > two-time upper limit normal (2ULN) (p = 0.002), GGT > 2ULN (0.026), and lower albumin (p = 0.020), higher systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (0.045), raised procalcitonin (p = 0.045), higher ferritin (p = 0.005), lower pO2 (p = 0.044), and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA) (p = 0.002) pointing to the inflammatory response as cause of liver injury. Factors predicting mortality with COVID-19 were assessed, which showed that direct bilirubin (p = 0.001), low albumin (p = 0.013), tachypnea (0.002), and leukocytosis (<0.001) were independently associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality.

METHODS: Twenty patients diagnosed with InfB from a hospital outbreak over a four-week-period were included. Nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) positive for InfB by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction were sent for lineage typing and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Medical records were reviewed retrospectively for data regarding patient characteristics, localization, exposure and outcome, and assembled into a timeline. In order to find possible connections to the hospital outbreak, all patients with a positive NPS for influenza from the region over an extended time period were also reviewed. FINDINGS: All 20 cases of InfB were of subtype B/Yamagata, and 17 of 20 patients could be linked to each other by either shared room or shared ward. WGS was successful or partially successful for 15 of the 17 viral isolates, and corroborated the epidemiological link supporting a close relationship. In the main affected ward, 19 of 75 inpatients were infected with InfB during the outbreak period, resulting in an attack rate of 25%. One probable case of influenza-related death was identified. CONCLUSION: InfB may spread within an acute care hospital, and advanced molecular methods may facilitate assessment of the source and extent of the outbreak. A multi-faceted approach, including rapid diagnosis, early recognition of outbreak situations, simple rules for patient management and the use of regular infection control measures, may prevent nosocomial transmission of influenza virus.","Sansone, M.; Wiman, Å.; Karlberg, M.L.; Brytting, M.; Bohlin, L.; Andersson, L-M.; Westin, J.; Nordén, R.",J Hosp Infect,22,16

Astrocytes, the major glial cell population of the central nervous system, were semipermissive for GDVII virus replication. Programmed cell death, demonstrated by apoptosis-specific caspase-3 protease activity, was maximal 8 h after GDVII infection at an m.o.i. of 1. Purified TMEV capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 did not induce apoptosis but antibodies to VP1 and VP2 inhibited it. Antibody inhibition of caspase-3 activity as well as flow cytometry experiments implicated TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and TNF-α-receptor (TNF-R) in apoptosis signaling. Converselly, TNF-α and the TRAIL-receptor were not upregulated. Furthermore, the number of functional TNF-α receptors, but not their affinity, was increased in apoptotic GDVII virus-infected astrocytes, as confirmed in binding experiments with (125)I-labeled recombinant murine TNF-α. In vivo studies showed that most of the cells loaded with the virus when injected in the brains of SJL mice were neurons but very few showed TUNEL costaining.

Scientists have proposed that many important infections emerged in the period following the advent of agriculture, as a result of newly dense populations and novel proximity to domestic animals that served as reservoirs for novel pathogens. Here, we review genomic evidence regarding pathogen origins, analyzing these data using the epidemiological transition framework. Genetic information has forced us to reconsider how and when many important pathogens emerged; it appears that a number of infections thought to result from contact with domesticated animals arose much earlier than agriculture was adopted. We also consider the broader effect of agriculture upon the microbiome, exploring potential consequences for human health.

RESULTS: Those who experienced either only verbal violence or both physical and verbal violence had lower Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy scores (p<0.05). Posttraumatic stress symptom severity was higher among people who experienced verbal violence than physical violence. HCWs’ exposure to verbal violence was associated with severe posttraumatic symptoms and a low level of empathy with patients (p<0.05). More than half of the victims of verbal violence responded that they did not take any action, receive organizational protection, or peer support, while most physically-abused HCWs received institutional intervention or help from others. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the critical importance of reducing verbal violence, which may represent a larger psychological burden compared to physical violence, by actively implementing effective strategies and policies at the institutional level.","Nam, Soo-hyun; Lee, Dong-Wook; Seo, Hwa-yeon; Hong, Yun-Chul; Yun, Je-Yeon; Cho, Sung-jun; Lee, Nami",Psychiatry Investig,22,1

We confirmed the repressive-mediated activity of the Scrt2 3′UTR through electroporation of luciferase constructs into chick embryos. Further, both CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of miR-125b/-200b responsive elements from chicken Scrt2 3′UTR and expression of miRNAs sponges increased Scrt2 expression field, suggesting a role for these miRNAs as post-transcriptional regulators of Scrt2. The biological effect of miR-125b titration was much more pronounced than that of miR-200b. Therefore, we propose that, after transcription, miR-125b fine-tunes the Scrt2 expression domain.","Goes, Carolina Purcell; Vieceli, Felipe Monteleone; De La Cruz, Shirley Mirna; Simões-Costa, Marcos; Yan, Chao Yun Irene",Front Cell Dev Biol,22,16

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the potential of a large Italian multi-database distributed network for use in the postmarketing surveillance of biological drugs, including biosimilars, in patients with IMID. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using 13 Italian regional claims databases during 2010–2019. A tailor-made R-based tool developed for distributed analysis of claims data using a study-specific common data model was customized for this study. We measured the yearly prevalence of biological drug users and the frequency of switches between originator and biosimilars for infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab separately and stratified them by calendar year and region. We then calculated the cumulative number of users and person-years (PYs) of exposure to individual biological drugs approved for IMIDs. For a number of safety outcomes (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-COV-2] infection), we conducted a sample power calculation to estimate the PYs of exposure required to investigate their association with individual biological drugs approved for IMIDs, considering different strengths of association. RESULTS: From a total underlying population of almost 50 million inhabitants from 13 Italian regions, we identified 143,602 (0.3%) biological drug users, with a cumulative exposure of 507,745 PYs during the entire follow-up. The mean age ± standard deviation of biological drug users was 49.3 ± 16.3, with a female-to-male ratio of 1.2. The age-adjusted yearly prevalence of biological drug users increased threefold from 0.7 per 1000 in 2010 to 2.1 per 1000 in 2019. Overall, we identified 40,996 users of biosimilars of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors (i.e., etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab) in the years 2015–2019. Of these, 46% (N = 18,845) switched at any time between originator and biosimilars or vice versa. To investigate a moderate association (incidence rate ratio 2) between biological drugs approved for IMIDs and safety events of interest, such as optic neuritis (lowest background incidence rate 10.4/100,000 PYs) or severe infection (highest background incidence rate 4312/100,000 PYs), a total of 43,311 PYs and 104 PYs of exposure to individual biological drugs, respectively, would be required. As such, using this network, of 15 individual biological drugs approved for IMIDs, the association with those adverse events could be investigated for four (27%) and 14 (93%), respectively. CONCLUSION: The VALORE project multi-database network has access to data on more than 140,000 biological drug users (and > 0.5 million PYs) from 13 Italian regions during the years 2010–2019, which will be further expanded with the inclusion of data from other regions and more recent calendar years. Overall, the cumulated amount of person-time of exposure to biological drugs approved for IMIDs provides enough statistical power to investigate weak/moderate associations of almost all individual compounds and the most relevant safety outcomes. Moreover, this network may offer the opportunity to investigate the interchangeability of originator and biosimilars of several TNFα inhibitors in different therapeutic areas in real-world settings.

This disease has become a reason for disturbance and concern. India, as a densely populated country, took initiative after the pandemic was declared. The objective of this study was to determine the mortality and recovery rates at 30 days from the first unlock phase after five phases of lockdown. The the number of infected people has continually increased, and currently, this pandemic continues to present challenges to public health. SUBJECT AND METHODS: Statistical analysis was used to calculate the mortality rate, ratio between active and death cases, active cases and recovered cases, recovered and death cases in India during the first 30 days of the unlock phase. RESULTS: The relationship between the new cases, deaths and recovered cases, shows that the new and recovered cases increased progressively. From the scatter plot of daily deaths and new cases, the R(2) value is 0.0047. That means the death ratio is low against the new cases. Also, if we look at another scatter plot, the ratio between new cases and recovery rate shows the R(2) value is 0.8015. That means the recovery rate was very high during the study period in India. The R(2) value of daily recovery and death is 0.0072. India faced a huge number of new coronavirus cases and increased death rate every day during the first unlock phase.

The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have unprecedented and unforeseeable consequences, from those on a worldwide/global level to those at the local level - at the level of local communities and families, and individuals (and not just humans, but all other living beings), of which the future will testify in various ways. The consequences will be political, economic, social, but probably to the greatest degree, the consequences of a health nature - systemic and individual. The death toll is high, despite the therapy being applied. We do not currently have a specific and effective therapy against COVID-19. In addition, we do not have a single clinical study that would support prophylactic therapy that could affect COVID-19. All of the therapeutic options now available to us are based on the experience we have gained in treating SARS and MERS. When the vaccine is discovered, at that moment we will be able to say that we have an appropriate and effective method in fighting against COVID-19. Some historians of medicine believe that voluntary vaccination against COVID-19 would be, not only less politically risky but also more effective in protecting the population from coronavirus. It remains to be seen what the new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, announced by WHO experts these days, and which is expected in the fall of 2020, will bring us.","Masic, Izet; Gerc, Vjekoslav",Med Arch,22,32

Assess uptake in testing amongst exposed healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 positive patients. DESIGN Free, voluntary SARS-CoV-2 testing was made available to asymptomatic hospital staff caring for COVID-19 positive patients over a 2-week period. SETTING A 283-bed teaching hospital in an urban setting within Michigan. PARTICIPANTS The program was offered to asymptomatic patient facing hospital staff in areas deemed to be of the highest risk based on likelihood of exposure to COVID-19 cases. METHODS Volunteer participants were tested utilizing the Cepheid GeneXpert RT-PCR platform via nasopharyngeal swabs and results were made available within four hours of testing. RESULTS Of 499 eligible participants, 121 personnel volunteered to undergo testing. All 121 tests were negative for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS Rigorous infection control practices, including universal patient testing, symptom screening of hospital workers, and cohorting of COVID-19 patients, are an effective method of preventing SARS-CoV-2 acquisition in healthcare workers routinely caring for COVID-19 positive patients. Successful implementation of these strategies may represent an effective alternative to routine and repeated testing of asymptomatic healthcare workers.","Jameson, Andrew P.; Biersack, Matthew P.; Sebastian, Tara M.; Jacques, Liberty R.",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,22,29

These restrictions had positive impacts for air quality due to a dramatic reduction of economic activity and atmospheric emissions. In this work, a machine learning approach was designed and implemented to analyze local air quality improvements during the COVID-19 lockdown in Graz, Austria. The machine learning approach was used as a robust alternative to simple, historical measurement comparisons for various individual pollutants. Concentrations of NO(2) (nitrogen dioxide), PM(10) (particulate matter), O(3) (ozone) and O(x) (total oxidant) were selected from five measurement sites in Graz and were set as target variables for random forest regression models to predict their expected values during the city's lockdown period. The true vs. expected difference is presented here as an indicator of true pollution during the lockdown. The machine learning models showed a high level of generalization for predicting the concentrations. Therefore, the approach was suitable for analyzing reductions in pollution concentrations. The analysis indicated that the city’s average concentration reductions for the lockdown period were: -36.9 to -41.6%, and -6.6 to -14.2% for NO(2) and PM(10,) respectively. However, an increase of 11.6 to 33.8% for O(3) was estimated. The reduction in pollutant concentration, especially NO(2) can be explained by significant drops in traffic-flows during the lockdown period (-51.6 to -43.9%). The results presented give a real-world example of what pollutant concentration reductions can be achieved by reducing traffic-flows and other economic activities.","Lovrić, Mario; Pavlović, Kristina; Vuković, Matej; Grange, Stuart K.; Haberl, Michael; Kern, Roman",Environ Pollut,22,1

In the cytoplasm of the infected cell, recognition of the presence of viral dsRNA as a signature of “non-self” nucleic acid is carried out by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), a set of dedicated helicases whose activation leads to the production of type I interferon α/β (IFN-α/β). To overcome the innate antiviral response, RNA viruses encode suppressors of IFN-α/β induction, which block RLRs recognition of dsRNA by means of different mechanisms that can be categorized into: (i) dsRNA binding and/or shielding (“hide”), (ii) dsRNA termini processing (“mask”) and (iii) direct interaction with components of the RLRs pathway (“hit”). In light of recent functional, biochemical and structural findings, we review the inhibition mechanisms of RLRs recognition of dsRNA displayed by a number of highly pathogenic RNA viruses with different disease phenotypes such as haemorrhagic fever (Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever, Lujo, Machupo, Junin, Guanarito, Crimean-Congo, Rift Valley fever, dengue), severe respiratory disease (influenza, SARS, Hendra, Hantaan, Sin Nombre, Andes) and encephalitis (Nipah, West Nile).","Zinzula, Luca; Tramontano, Enzo",Antiviral Res,22,16

One of the key non-technical obstacles to widespread adoption of CTA has been concerns about privacy. We present a causal probabilistic model (a Bayesian network) that provides the basis for a practical CTA solution that does not compromise privacy. Users of the model can provide as much or little personal information as they wish about relevant risk factors, symptoms, and recent social interactions. The model then provides them feedback about the likelihood of the presence of asymptotic, mild or severe COVID19 (past, present and projected). When the model is embedded in a smartphone app, it can be used to detect new outbreaks in a monitored population and identify outbreak locations as early as possible. For this purpose, the only data needed to be centrally collected is the probability the user has COVID19 and the GPS location.","Fenton, N.; McLachlan, S.; Lucas, P.; Dube, K.; Hitman, G.; Osman, M.; Kyrimi, E.; Neil, M.",,22,1

The World Health Organization published a guideline as a way of supporting mental health and psychosocial well-being of different groups during this pandemic. The impact of the pandemic has pushed governments to put measures in place to curb not only the physical health of individuals but their mental health and psychosocial well-being as well. The aim of our paper was to review mental health guidelines of some Sub Saharan African (SSA) countries: (i) to assess their appropriateness for the immediate mental health needs at this time, (ii) to form as a basis for ongoing reflection as the current pandemic evolves. Guidelines were retrieved openly from internet search and some were requested from mental health practitioners in various SSA countries. The authors designed a semi structured questionnaire, as a self-interview guide to gain insight on the experience of COVID-19 from experts in the mental health sector in the various countries. While we used a document analysis approach to analyze the data, we made use of the Mental Health Preparedness and Action Framework to discuss our findings. We received health or mental health guidelines from 10 SSA countries. Cameroon, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda all had mental health guidelines or mental health component in their health guidelines. Our experts highlight that the mental health needs of the people are of concern during this pandemic but have not been given priority. They go further to suggest that the mental health needs are slightly different during this time and requiring a different approach especially considering the measures taken to curb the spread of disease. We conclude that despite the provision of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support guidelines, gaps still exist making them inadequate to meet the mental health needs of their communities.","Molebatsi, Keneilwe; Musindo, Otsetswe; Ntlantsana, Vuyokazi; Wambua, Grace Nduku",Front Psychiatry,22,20

Here, we used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a system to identify novel functional interactions between viral proteins and eukaryotic cells. Our work demonstrates that when the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) ORF4a accessory gene is expressed in yeast it causes a slow-growth phenotype. ORF4a has been characterized as an interferon antagonist in mammalian cells, and yet yeast lack an interferon system, suggesting further interactions between ORF4a and eukaryotic cells. Using the slow-growth phenotype as a reporter of ORF4a function, we utilized the yeast knockout library collection to perform a suppressor screen where we identified the YDL042C/SIR2 yeast gene as a suppressor of ORF4a function. The mammalian homologue of SIR2 is SIRT1, an NAD-dependent histone deacetylase. We found that when SIRT1 was inhibited by either chemical or genetic manipulation, there was reduced MERS-CoV replication, suggesting that SIRT1 is a proviral factor for MERS-CoV. Moreover, ORF4a inhibited SIRT1-mediated modulation of NF-κB signaling, demonstrating a functional link between ORF4a and SIRT1 in mammalian cells. Overall, the data presented here demonstrate the utility of yeast studies for identifying genetic interactions between viral proteins and eukaryotic cells. We also demonstrate for the first time that SIRT1 is a proviral factor for MERS-CoV replication and that ORF4a has a role in modulating its activity in cells. IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) initially emerged in 2012 and has since been responsible for over 2,300 infections, with a case fatality ratio of approximately 35%. We have used the highly characterized model system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate novel functional interactions between viral proteins and eukaryotic cells that may provide new avenues for antiviral intervention. We identify a functional link between the MERS-CoV ORF4a proteins and the YDL042C/SIR2 yeast gene. The mammalian homologue of SIR2 is SIRT1, an NAD-dependent histone deacetylase. We demonstrate for the first time that SIRT1 is a proviral factor for MERS-CoV replication and that ORF4a has a role in modulating its activity in mammalian cells.","Weston, Stuart; Matthews, Krystal L.; Lent, Rachel; Vlk, Alexandra; Haupt, Rob; Kingsbury, Tami; Frieman, Matthew B.",Journal of Virology,22,28

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reported rates of return to play (RTP) in conjunction with the expert-derived guidelines previously recommended to enable safe RTP post COVID-19 infection. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Two independent reviewers searched the literature based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, utilizing the MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus databases. Only studies that reported rates of RTP and/or recommended guidelines for safe RTP were included. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Overall, 17 studies (3 level III and 14 level V) were included. A total of 3 studies reported rates of RTP in a total of 1255 athletes and 623 officials; 72 (30 symptomatic) were infected with COVID-19, 100% of whom were able to RTP post COVID-19 infection. Of the 14 studies recommending guidelines for safe RTP, 3 and 9 studies recommended 7 and 14 days of rest in isolation respectively for asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 infection, prior to safe RTP. In contrast, 7 studies recommended 3 to 6 months of rest (following 14 d isolation) in cases of COVID-19-induced myocarditis as a safe timeframe for safe RTP. Of the 11 studies reporting on whether blanket testing prior to RTP was recommended, only 7 studies recommended a negative test result as mandatory prior to RTP for athletes previously infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Although excellent rates of RTP have been reported for elite athletes post COVID-19 infection, discrepancies in recommended rest periods, requirement for mandatory negative test results, and the magnitude of screening investigations required continue to exist in the literature, with a need for further standardized international guidelines required in future.

In severe cases, the disease can progress to respiratory distress, hypoxia, and multi-organ failure, all of which are associated with high mortality. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess potent and broad-ranging immunomodulatory activities. MSCs have demonstrated their impressive ability to inhibit lung damage, reduce inflammation, attenuate the immune response, and aid with alveolar fluid clearance. Studies that investigated the use of MSCs and exosome cells derived from MSCs in treating COVD-19 patients have encouraging results. The conclusion of the results of four clinical studies, as presented in this review article, is reduced patient mortality in more than half of the subjects who were administered MSCs or exosomes derived from MSCs, intravenously, positioning these cells as a possible therapeutic solution for COVID-19.

However, its environmental consequences are poorly understood. Thus, to assess whether COVID-19 therapy based on the use of azithromycin (AZT) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) during the pandemic affects wild aquatic life, we exposed (for 72 hours) neotropical tadpoles of the species Physalaemus cuvieri to the water containing these drugs to 12.5 μg/L. We observed that the increase in superoxide dismutase and catalase in tadpoles exposed to AZT (alone or in combination with HCQ) was predominant to keep the production of NO, ROS, TBARS and H2O2 equitable between the experimental groups. In addition, the uptake of AZT and the strong interaction of AZT with acetylcholinesterase (AChE), predicted by the molecular docking analysis, were associated with the anticholinesterase effect observed in the groups exposed to the antibiotic. However, the unexpected increase in butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in these same groups suggests its constitutive role in maintaining cholinergic homeostasis. Therefore, taken together, our data provide a pioneering evidence that the exposure of P. cuvieri tadpoles to AZT (alone or in combination with HCQ) in a predictably increased environmental concentration (12.5 μg/L) elicits a compensatory adaptive response that can have, in the short period of exposure, guaranteed the survival of the animals. However, the high energy cost for maintaining physiological homeostasis, can compromise the growth and development of animals and, therefore, in the medium-long term, have a general negative effect on the health of animals. Thus, it is possible that COVID-19 therapy, based on the use of AZT, affects wild aquatic life, which requires greater attention to the impacts that this drug may represent.","da Luz, Thiarlen Marinho; da Costa Araújo, Amanda Pereira; Estrela, Fernanda Neves; Braz, Helyson Lucas Bezerra; Jorge, Roberta Jeane Bezerra; Charlie-Silva, Ives; Malafaia, Guilherme",Sci Total Environ,22,28

This modification has not been described for any other viral protein; however, many viral transmembrane glycoproteins contain one or more of the recognition motifs (W-x-x-W). Elimination of the C-mannose on sGP did not significantly alter protein biosynthesis, processing or structure. Furthermore, the protective effect of sGP on endothelial barrier function, currently the only known activity of sGP, was unaltered. It is possible that C-mannosylation may be a common post-translational modification of viral transmembrane glycoproteins where it could play a role in particle maturation and/or entry by stabilizing the structure of these proteins. In this regard, C-mannosylation of sGP may be an anomaly resulting from the unique manner in which this protein is generated as the product of unedited transcripts from the glycoprotein gene of Ebola.","Falzarano, Darryl; Krokhin, Oleg; Van Domselaar, Gary; Wolf, Kristin; Seebach, Jochen; Schnittler, Hans-Joachim; Feldmann, Heinz",Virology,22,21

The Scoring Algorithm of Molecular Subphenotypes (SAMS) was applied to distinguish high versus low-risk profiles in all cohorts. SAMS cutoffs derived from the COVID-19 Discovery cohort were used to predict intensive care unit (ICU) status, need for mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality in the COVID-19 Validation cohort. A COVID-19 Single-cell RNA-sequencing cohort was used to identify the cellular sources of the 50-gene risk profiles. The same COVID-19 SAMS cutoffs were used to predict mortality in the IPF cohorts. FINDINGS: 50-gene risk profiles discriminated severe from mild COVID-19 in the Discovery cohort (P = 0·015) and predicted ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality (AUC: 0·77, 0·75, and 0·74, respectively, P < 0·001) in the COVID-19 Validation cohort. In COVID-19, 50-gene expressing cells with a high-risk profile included monocytes, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, while low-risk profile-expressing cells included CD4(+), CD8(+) T lymphocytes, IgG producing plasmablasts, B cells, NK, and gamma/delta T cells.

The effect of reconfiguring the supply chain is first examined in a non-security breach scenario and then in a breached scenario. We find that reconfiguration has no benefit to a supply chain using a parameter based replenishment policy (option I), in both breach and non-breach situations, but leads to significant advantage when batch ordering model (option II) or a combined batch-and-parameter based ordering policy (option III) is used. We also established that batch ordering system favours the risk pooling strategy whereas a combined batch-and-parameter ordering system favours the simplification counterpart especially when the simplification is at the wholesaler tier. This study has significant implications for supply chain design as well as information security priorities. This is one of the first papers to look at how ISB impacts supply chain configuration and the role of ordering decision context.","Durowoju, Olatunde A.; Chan, Hing Kai; Wang, Xiaojun; Akenroye, Temidayo",Int J Prod Econ,22,1

A total of 1359 handball players participated (age: 23 ± 6 years). Participants from Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa answered an online version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) considering “before” and “during” confinement. COVID-19 home confinement has had a negative effect on PA (vigorous, moderate, walking, and overall). The largest decrease was in the sum parameter “all PA” (MET (metabolic equivalent of task)-min/week, η(p)(2) = 0.903; min/week, η(p)(2) = 0.861). Daily sitting time increased from 2.7 to 5.0 h per weekday (p < 0.001, η(p)(2) = 0.669). For gender, continent, country, level of handball league, and playing position, no significant differences (group and interaction effects) were observed. The largest change in PA behavior was in walking (minutes per day: η(p)(2) = 0.755), with males displaying the greatest decrease (from 62 ± 11 to 30 ± 14 min per weekday; d = 2.67). In terms of magnitude, difference between genders was greatest for sitting time (difference in d = 1.20). In conclusion, while COVID-19 measures were essential to preserve public health, PA was compromised and sedentary behavior increased because of these public health measures regardless of gender, playing position, and competition level.","Hermassi, Souhail; Bouhafs, El Ghali; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Ichimura, Shiro; Alsharji, Khaled E.; Hayes, Lawrence D.; Schwesig, René",Int J Environ Res Public Health,22,19

Here we characterize transmission risk between 1,178 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and their 15,648 close contacts based on detailed contact tracing data from Hunan, China. We find that 80% of secondary transmissions can be traced back to 14% of SARS-CoV-2 infections, indicating substantial transmission heterogeneities. Regression analysis suggests a marked gradient of transmission risk scales positively with the duration of exposure and the closeness of social interactions, after adjusted for demographic and clinical factors. Population-level physical distancing measures confine transmission to families and households; while case isolation and contact quarantine reduce transmission in all settings. Adjusted for interventions, the reconstructed infectiousness profile of a typical SARS-CoV-2 infection peaks just before symptom presentation, with ~50% of transmission occurring in the pre-symptomatic phase. Modelling results indicate that achieving SARS-CoV-2 control would require the synergistic efforts of case isolation, contact quarantine, and population-level physical distancing measures, owing to the particular transmission kinetics of this virus.","Sun, K.; Wang, W.; Gao, L.; Wang, Y.; Luo, K.; Ren, L.; Zhan, Z.; Chen, X.; Zhao, S.; Huang, Y.; Sun, Q.; Liu, Z.; Litvinova, M.; Vespignani, A.; Ajelli, M.; Viboud, C.; Yu, H.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,22,20

As no effective novel drugs are available currently, drug repurposing is an alternative intervention strategy. Here we present an in silico drug repurposing study that implements successful concepts of computer-aided drug design (CADD) technology for repurposing known drugs to interfere with viral cellular entry via the spike glycoprotein (SARS-CoV-2-S), which mediates host cell entry via the hACE2 receptor. Methods: A total of 4015 known and approved small molecules were screened for interaction with SARS-CoV-2-S through docking studies and 15 lead molecules were shortlisted. Additionally, streptomycin, ciprofloxacin, and glycyrrhizic acid (GA) were selected based on their reported anti-viral activity, safety, availability and affordability. The 18 molecules were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Results: The MD simulation results indicate that GA of plant origin may be repurposed for SARS-CoV-2 intervention, pending further studies. Conclusions: Repurposing is a beneficial strategy for treating COVID-19 with existing drugs. It is aimed at using docking studies to screen molecules for clinical application and investigating their efficacy in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2-S. SARS-CoV-2-S is a key pathogenic protein that mediates pathogen-host interaction. Hence, the molecules screened for inhibitory properties against SARS-CoV-2-S can be clinically used to treat COVID-19 since the safety profile is already known.","BR, Bharath; Damle, Hrishikesh; Ganju, Shiban; Damle, Latha",F1000Res,22,10

Reconstituting the native tissue or cellular microenvironment will be vital for successful evaluation of pathogenicity of viral infection and screening of potential vaccines. Therefore, establishing a reliable in vitro model to study the vaccine efficiency or delivery of viral disease is important. Here, this review summarizes two major ways that tissue engineering and 3DP strategies could contribute to vaccine research: (1) 3D human tissue models to study the response to virus can be served as a testbed for new potential therapeutics. Using 3D tissue platform attempts to explore alternative options to pre-clinical animal research for evaluating vaccine candidates. (2) 3DP technologies can be applied to improve the vaccination strategies which could replace existing vaccine delivery. Controlled antigen release using carriers that are generated with biodegradable biomaterials can further enhance the efficient development of immunity as well as combination of multiple-dose vaccines into a single injection.

We conducted a qualitative study to explore barriers to ART maintenance and solutions to ART interruption when stringent COVID‐19 control measures were implemented in China, from the perspective of PLHIV and relevant key stakeholders. METHODS: Between 11 February and 15 February 2020, we interviewed PLHIV, community‐based organization (CBO) workers, staff from centres for disease control and prevention (CDC) at various levels whose work is relevant to HIV care (CDC staff), HIV doctors and nurses and drug vendors from various regions in China. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted using a messaging and social media app. Challenges and responses relevant to ART continuity during the COVID‐19 pandemic were discussed. Themes were identified by transcript coding and mindmaps. RESULTS: Sixty‐four stakeholders were recruited, including 16 PLHIV, 17 CBO workers, 15 CDC staff, 14 HIV doctors and nurses and two drug vendors. Many CDC staff, HIV doctors and nurses responsible for ART delivery and HIV care were shifted to COVID‐19 response efforts. Barriers to ART maintenance were (a) travel restrictions, (b) inadequate communication and bureaucratic obstacles, (c) shortage in personnel, (d) privacy concerns, and (e) insufficient ART reserve. CBO helped PLHIV maintain access to ART through five solutions identified from thematic analysis: (a) coordination to refill ART from local CDC clinics or hospitals, (b) delivery of ART by mail, (c) privacy protection measures, (d) mental health counselling, and (e) providing connections to alternative sources of ART. Drug vendors contributed to ART maintenance by selling out‐of‐pocket ART. CONCLUSIONS: Social and institutional disruption from COVID‐19 contributed to increased risk of ART interruption among PLHIV in China. Collaboration among key stakeholders was needed to maintain access to ART, with CBO playing an important role. Other countries facing ART interruption during current or future public health emergencies may learn from the solutions employed in China.","Sun, Yinghui; Zhan, Yuewei; Li, Hui; Yuan, Tanwei; Gao, Yanxiao; Liang, Bowen; Feng, Anping; Li, Peiyang; Zheng, Weiran; Fitzpatrick, Thomas; Wu, Dan; Zhai, Xinyi; Zou, Huachun",J Int AIDS Soc,22,22

Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly variable with common hyperactivity of immune responses known as a “cytokine storm”. In fact, this massive release of inflammatory cytokines into in the pulmonary alveolar structure is a main cause of mortality during COVID-19 infection. Current management of COVID-19 is supportive and there is no common clinical protocol applied to suppress this pathological state. Lactoferrin (LF), an iron binding protein, is a first line defense protein that is present in neutrophils and excretory fluids of all mammals, and is well recognized for its role in maturation and regulation of immune system function. Also, due to its ability to sequester free iron, LF is known to protect against insult-induced oxidative stress and subsequent “cytokine storm” that results in dramatic necrosis within the affected tissue. Review of the literature strongly suggests utility of LF to silence the “cytokine storm”, giving credence to both prophylactic and therapeutic approaches towards combating COVID-19 infection.","Zimecki, Michał; Actor, Jeffrey K.; Kruzel, Marian L.",Int Immunopharmacol,22,1

While previous investigations have reported that individuals’ sexual preferences are influenced by a pathogen threat, the empirical support for face preference is mixed (i.e., the association of pathogenic threat and individuals’ preferences for masculine and/or feminine faces is equivocal). The COVID-19 pandemic provides the opportunity to investigate the association of pathogenic threat and men’s and women’s preferences for sexual dimorphism of faces in the opposite sex in a real-world pathogenic situation. METHODS: Data were collected during COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020) from men and women in the United States, and women in Iran, on preferences for masculinity in men’s faces using women participants, and femininity in women’s faces using men. RESULTS: Results showed that concern about an actual pathogenic threat (i.e., contracting COVID-19) predicts men’s preference for female facial femininity, but not women’s preference for male facial masculinity (for both U.S. and Iranian women). CONCLUSION: By using an actual pathogenic threat, our results support previous findings that men’s preferences for female faces are shifted to less feminine faces under pathogenic threat. Moreover, our results provide support for the distinction between the behavioral immune system and pathogen disgust, at least for men’s preference for feminine female faces.

The novel coronavirus affects the respiratory system, producing symptoms such as fever, cough, dyspnea, and pneumonia. The association between COVID-19 and coagulation has been previously reported. Due to several inflammatory changes that occur in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections such as alterations in the levels of clotting factors, platelet activation leads to thrombus formation in coronary and cerebral vessels, leading to myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents, respectively. Unfortunately, the progression of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is rapid in patients with and without comorbidities. Hence, the proper monitoring of thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19 is essential to avoid further complications.

Operational leaders used data insights and predictions from Data Coronavirus Analytics Research Team to redeploy critical care resources across the hospital system, and real-time data were used daily to make adjustments to staffing and supply decisions. Geographical data were used to triage patients to other hospitals in our system when COVID-19 detected pavilions were at capacity. Additionally, one of the consequences of COVID-19 was the inability for patients to receive elective care leading to extended periods of pain and uncertainty about a disease or treatment.

This epidemiological 'curve' refers to the cases versus time graph, which shows the rise of a disease to its peak before descending. The aim in a pandemic is to flatten this curve by reducing the peak and spreading out the timeline. However, the models used to predict this curve are often not clearly outlined, no model parameters are given, and models are not tested against real data. This lack of detail makes it difficult to recreate the curve. What is much needed is a simple tool for approximating the curve to allow ideas to be tested and comparisons made. Methods This work presents a Simple Curve Approximation Tool (SCAT) which can be used by anyone. This tool allows the user to approximate and draw the curve and allows testing of assumptions, trajectories and the wildly varying figures reported in the media. The mathematics behind SCAT is clearly outlined here but understanding of this is not required. SCAT is provided online as a downloadable MS Excel workbook with some sample cases shown. Throughout this work, the parameters used are specified so that all results can be easily reproduced. Findings Although not intended as a prediction tool, SCAT has achieved less than 0.5 % error in short-term forward prediction. It also shows a very significant improvement on the pandemic exponential approximations found throughout media reporting. As a comparison tool, it highlights obvious differences between COVID-19 and other diseases, such as influenza, and between countries at different stages of the pandemic (China, Italy and the UK are used here for demonstration purposes).

Several studies have identified pregnant women as a vulnerable group during the COVID-19 pandemic. The perinatal period has been identified as a stage of great risk for the mental health of pregnant women, due to a large increase in mental pathologies during this period. In this context, the objective of the present study was to assess the associations between socioeconomic and demographic factors, health concerns and health information management, and anxiety level during the COVID-19 pandemic in pregnant Spanish women. Method. The sample of this cross-sectional study was comprised of 353 pregnant women, aged 18 or older and residing in Spain. Data collection was carried out from 1 June to 30 September 2020. Participants were recruited from Quirónsalud University Hospital of Madrid. Multilevel regression models were built to value the associations between demographic factors, health concerns and health information management, and anxiety level during the COVID-19 pandemic among pregnant women. Results. Reduced working hours and income due to the COVID-19 pandemic were related to increased anxiety levels, as was the level of concern about COVID-19 symptoms, potential complications, contagion and consequences for the baby. Worries caused by restrictive measures adopted against COVID-19 and resulting isolation, delivery, postpartum and breastfeeding were also associated with increased anxiety levels. Being a separated or divorced woman and being informed to a greater extent by a midwife were related to lower anxiety levels. An increase in the degree of information obtained about COVID-19 symptoms, complications, contagion and consequences for the baby, restrictive measures and isolation adopted against COVID-19, delivery, postpartum and breastfeeding, were also related to decreased anxiety levels. Conclusions. The most vulnerable future mothers in terms of anxiety levels are those with reduced working hours and income due to the COVID-19 pandemic, those with a higher level of concern and who had access to a lesser degree of information about COVID-19 (symptoms and complications, contagion and consequences on the baby, restrictive measures and isolation, delivery, postpartum and breastfeeding), as well as pregnant women who have obtained information about COVID-19 during pregnancy from TV.","Esteban-Gonzalo, Sara; Caballero-Galilea, María; González-Pascual, Juan Luis; Álvaro-Navidad, Miguel; Esteban-Gonzalo, Laura",Int J Environ Res Public Health,22,14

We analyze the distribution of CpG dinucleotides, a pathogen-associated molecular pattern, in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We find that the CpG content, which we characterize by a force parameter that accounts for statistical constraints acting on the genome at the nucleotidic and amino-acid levels, is, on average, low compared to other pathogenic betacoronaviruses. However, the CpG force widely fluctuates along the genome, with a particularly low value, comparable to the circulating seasonal HKU1, in the spike coding region and a greater value, comparable to SARS and MERS, in the highly expressed nucleocapside coding region (N ORF), whose transcripts are relatively abundant in the cytoplasm of infected cells and present in the 3’UTRs of all subgenomic RNA. This dual nature of CpG content could confer to SARS-CoV-2 the ability to avoid triggering pattern recognition receptors upon entry, while eliciting a stronger response during replication. We then investigate the evolution of synonymous mutations since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, finding a signature of CpG loss in regions with a greater CpG force. Sequence motifs preceding the CpG-loss-associated loci in the N ORF match recently identified binding patterns of the Zinc finger Anti-viral Protein. Using a model of the viral gene evolution under human host pressure, we find that synonymous mutations seem driven in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and particularly in the N ORF, by the viral codon bias, the transition-transversion bias and the pressure to lower CpG content.","Di Gioacchino, Andrea; Šulc, Petr; Komarova, Anastassia V.; Greenbaum, Benjamin D.; Monasson, Rémi; Cocco, Simona",bioRxiv,22,27

Yet the impact of depression on social cognition and functioning is not well understood. Assessment of social cognition is crucial not only for a better understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD), but also for screening, intervention, and remediation. Here by applying a novel experimental tool, a Face-n-Food task comprising a set of images bordering on the Giuseppe Arcimboldo style, we assessed the face tuning in patients with MDD and person-by-person matched controls. The key benefit of these images is that single components do not trigger face processing. Contrary to common beliefs, the outcome indicates that individuals with depression express intact face responsiveness. Yet, while in depression face sensitivity is tied with perceptual organization, in typical development, it is knotted with social cognition capabilities. Face tuning in depression, therefore, may rely upon altered behavioral strategies and underwriting brain mechanisms. To exclude a possible camouflaging effect of female social skills, we examined gender impact. Neither in depression nor in typical individuals had females excelled in face tuning. The outcome sheds light on the origins of the face sensitivity and alterations in social functioning in depression and mental well-being at large. Aberrant social functioning in depression is likely to be the result of deeply-rooted maladaptive strategies rather than of poor sensitivity to social signals. This has implications for mental well-being under the current pandemic conditions.","Kubon, Julian; Sokolov, Alexander N; Popp, Rebecca; Fallgatter, Andreas J; Pavlova, Marina A",Cereb Cortex,22,26

Given the ubiquity of the surgical procedure and the need for favorable outcomes, as it is an elective operation on otherwise healthy individuals, it is imperative to ensure appropriate preoperative risk stratification and anticipate intraoperative challenges. The aim of the present study was to compare peri-and postoperative outcomes of living kidney donors (LD), who had undergone laparoscopic nephrectomy (LDN), with a control group of those who had undergone open nephrectomy (ODN). Health-related quality of life (QoL) was also assessed using the validated SF-36 questionnaire. Data from 252 LD from a single transplant center from March 2015 to December 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. In total, 117 donors in the LDN and 135 in the ODN groups were assessed. Demographics, type of transplantation, BMI, duration of surgery, length of hospital stay, peri- and postoperative complications, renal function at discharge and QoL were recorded and compared between the two groups using Stata 13.0 software. There was no difference in baseline characteristics, nor in the prevalence of peri-and postoperative complications, with a total complication rate of 16% (mostly minor, Clavien–Dindo grade II) in both groups, while a different pattern of surgical complications was noticed between them. Duration of surgery was significantly longer in the ODN group (median 240 min vs. 160 min in LDN, p < 0.01), warm ischemia time was longer in the LDN group (median 6 min vs.2 min in ODN, p < 0.01) and length of hospital stay shorter in the LDN group (median 3 days vs. 7 days in ODN). Conversion rate from laparoscopic to open surgery was 2.5%. There was a drop in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at discharge of 36 mL/min in the LDN and 32 mL/min in the ODN groups, respectively (p = 0.03). No death, readmission or reoperation were recorded. There was a significant difference in favor of LDN group for each one of the eight items of the questionnaire (SF1–SF8). As for the two summary scores, while the total physical component summary (PCS) score was comparable between the two groups (57.87 in the LDN group and 57.07 in the ODN group), the mental component summary (MCS) score was significantly higher (62.14 vs. 45.22, p < 0.001) in the LDN group. This study provides evidence that minimally invasive surgery can be performed safely, with very good short-term outcomes, providing several benefits for the living kidney donor, thereby contributing to expanding the living donor pool, which is essential, especially in countries with deceased-donor organ shortage.","Vernadakis, Spyridon; Marinaki, Smaragdi; Darema, Maria; Soukouli, Ioanna; Michelakis, Ioannis El.; Beletsioti, Chrysoula; Zavvos, Georgios; Bokos, Ioannis; Boletis, Ioannis N.",J Clin Med,22,21

We compared the presentation characteristics and outcomes of adults with and without HIV who were hospitalized with COVID-19 at 207 centers across the United Kingdom and whose data were prospectively captured by the ISARIC WHO CCP study. METHODS: We used Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression to describe the association between HIV status and day-28 mortality, after separate adjustment for sex, ethnicity, age, hospital acquisition of COVID-19 (definite hospital acquisition excluded), presentation date, ten individual comorbidities, and disease severity at presentation (as defined by hypoxia or oxygen therapy). RESULTS: Among 47,592 patients, 122 (0.26%) had confirmed HIV infection and 112/122 (91.8%) had a record of antiretroviral therapy. At presentation, HIV-positive people were younger (median 56 versus 74 years; p<0.001) and had fewer comorbidities, more systemic symptoms and higher lymphocyte counts and C-reactive protein levels. The cumulative day-28 mortality was similar in the HIV-positive vs. HIV-negative groups (26.7% vs. 32.1%; p=0.16), but in those under 60 years of age HIV-positive status was associated with increased mortality (21.3% vs. 9.6%; p<0.001 [log-rank test]). Mortality was higher among people with HIV after adjusting for age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-2.14; p=0.05), and the association persisted after adjusting for the other variables (aHR 1.69; 95% CI 1.15-2.48; p=0.008) and when restricting the analysis to people aged <60 years (aHR 2.87; 95% CI 1.70-4.84; p<0.001).

METHODS: A 22-item survey addressing four themes during the early pandemic (time on service, structured education, clinical training, future plans) was emailed to Society of Breast Imaging members and members-in-training in July 2020. Responses were compared using McNemar’s and Mann-Whitney U tests; a general linear model was used for multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Of 136 responses (136/2824, 4.8%), 96 U.S. responses from radiologists with trainees, residents, and fellows were included. Clinical exposure declined during the early pandemic, with almost no medical students on service (66/67, 99%) and fewer clinical days for residents (78/89, 88%) and fellows (48/68, 71%). Conferences shifted to remote live format (57/78, 73%), with some canceled (15/78, 19%). Compared to pre-pandemic, resident diagnostic (75/78, 96% versus 26/78, 33%) (P<0.001) and procedural (73/78, 94% versus 21/78, 27%) (P<0.001) participation fell, as did fellow diagnostic (60/61, 98% versus 47/61, 77%) (P=0.001) and procedural (60/61, 98% versus 43/61, 70%) (P<0.001) participation.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A designated hospital for patients with covid-19 in Zhejiang province, China. PARTICIPANTS: 96 consecutively admitted patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection: 22 with mild disease and 74 with severe disease. Data were collected from 19 January 2020 to 20 March 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load measured in respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples. Cycle threshold values, a measure of nucleic acid concentration, were plotted onto the standard curve constructed on the basis of the standard product. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained through data collection forms from electronic medical records, and the relation between clinical data and disease severity was analysed. RESULTS: 3497 respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples were collected from patients after admission and evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral load. Infection was confirmed in all patients by testing sputum and saliva samples. RNA was detected in the stool of 55 (59%) patients and in the serum of 39 (41%) patients. The urine sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The median duration of virus in stool (22 days, interquartile range 17-31 days) was significantly longer than in respiratory (18 days, 13-29 days; P=0.02) and serum samples (16 days, 11-21 days; P<0.001). The median duration of virus in the respiratory samples of patients with severe disease (21 days, 14-30 days) was significantly longer than in patients with mild disease (14 days, 10-21 days; P=0.04). In the mild group, the viral loads peaked in respiratory samples in the second week from disease onset, whereas viral load continued to be high during the third week in the severe group. Virus duration was longer in patients older than 60 years and in male patients. CONCLUSION: The duration of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly longer in stool samples than in respiratory and serum samples, highlighting the need to strengthen the management of stool samples in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and the virus persists longer with higher load and peaks later in the respiratory tissue of patients with severe disease.","Zheng, Shufa; Fan, Jian; Yu, Fei; Feng, Baihuan; Lou, Bin; Zou, Qianda; Xie, Guoliang; Lin, Sha; Wang, Ruonan; Yang, Xianzhi; Chen, Weizhen; Wang, Qi; Zhang, Dan; Liu, Yanchao; Gong, Renjie; Ma, Zhaohui; Lu, Siming; Xiao, Yanyan; Gu, Yaxi; Zhang, Jinming; Yao, Hangping; Xu, Kaijin; Lu, Xiaoyang; Wei, Guoqing; Zhou, Jianying; Fang, Qiang; Cai, Hongliu; Qiu, Yunqing; Sheng, Jifang; Chen, Yu; Liang, Tingbo",BMJ,22,21

Of the 71 symptomatic episodes, only 45% were associated with increased respiratory and/or nutritional support. Rhinovirus/enteroviruses were most common (69%) and involved nine of 12 transmission events.

Methods PubMed/Medline and Cochrane databases were searched between 1980 and October 2019 for studies reporting outcomes on optical diagnosis training of colorectal polyps. The primary outcome was optical diagnosis accuracy compared to histological analysis pre-training and post-training intervention. Subgroup analyses of experienced/trainee endoscopists, training methods, and small/diminutive polyps were included. Results Overall, 16 studies met inclusion criteria, analyzing the impact of training on 179 endoscopists. Pre-training accuracy was 70.3 % (6416/9131 correct diagnoses) whereas post-training accuracy was 81.6 % (7416/9213 correct diagnoses) (risk ratio [RR] 1.17; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.09–1.24, P < 0.001). In experienced endoscopists, accuracy improved from 69.8 % (3771/5403 correct diagnoses) to 82.4 % (4521/5485 correct diagnoses) (RR 1.20; 95 % CI: 1.11–1.29, P < 0.001).

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the degree to which expanding fecal immunochemical test–based colorectal cancer screening participation during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with clinical outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A previously developed simulation model was adopted to estimate how much COVID-19 may have contributed to colorectal cancer outcomes. The model included the US population estimated to have completed colorectal cancer screening pre–COVID-19 according the American Cancer Society. The model was designed to estimate colorectal cancer outcomes between 2020 and 2023. This analysis was completed between July and December 2020. EXPOSURES: Adults screened for colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer cases detected by stage. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Estimates of colorectal cancer outcomes across 4 scenarios: (1) 9 months of 50% colorectal cancer screenings followed by 21 months of 75% colorectal cancer screenings; (2) 18 months of 50% screening followed by 12 months of 75% screening; (3) scenario 1 with increased use of fecal immunochemical tests; and (4) scenario 2 with increased use of fecal immunochemical tests. RESULTS: In our simulation model, COVID-19–related reductions in care utilization resulted in an estimated 1 176 942 to 2 014 164 fewer colorectal cancer screenings, 8346 to 12 894 fewer colorectal cancer diagnoses, and 6113 to 9301 fewer early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses between 2020 and 2023. With an abbreviated period of reduced colorectal cancer screenings, increasing fecal immunochemical test use was associated with an estimated additional 588 844 colorectal cancer screenings and 2836 colorectal cancer diagnoses, of which 1953 (68.9%) were early stage. In the event of a prolonged period of reduced colorectal cancer screenings, increasing fecal immunochemical test use was associated with an estimated additional 655 825 colorectal cancer screenings and 2715 colorectal cancer diagnoses, of which 1944 (71.6%) were early stage. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest that the increased use of fecal immunochemical tests during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased colorectal cancer screening participation and more colorectal cancer diagnoses at earlier stages. If our estimates are borne out in real-world clinical practice, increasing fecal immunochemical test–based colorectal cancer screening participation during the COVID-19 pandemic could mitigate the consequences of reduced screening rates during the pandemic for colorectal cancer outcomes.","Issaka, Rachel B.; Taylor, Preston; Baxi, Anand; Inadomi, John M.; Ramsey, Scott D.; Roth, Joshua",JAMA Netw Open,22,20

The use of remote cardiac telemetry as an alternative to 12‑lead electrocardiography (ECG) for continuous QTc monitoring may facilitate this strategy, but its application has not yet been validated or implemented. METHODS: In the validation component of this two-part prospective cohort study, a total of 65 hospitalized patients with simultaneous ECG and telemetry were identified. QTc obtained via remote telemetry as measured by 3 independent, blinded operators were compared with ECG as assessed by 2 board-certified electrophysiologists as the gold-standard. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to measure the strength of linear correlation between the two methods. In a separate cohort comprised of 68 COVID-19 patients treated with combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, telemetry-based QTc values were compared at serial time points after medication administration using Friedman rank-sum test of repeated measures. RESULTS: Telemetry-based QTc measurements highly correlated with QTc values derived from ECG, with correlation coefficients of 0.74, 0.79, 0.85 (individual operators), and 0.84 (mean of all operators). Among the COVID-19 cohort, treatment led to a median QTc increase of 15 milliseconds between baseline and following the 9th dose (p = 0.002), with 8 (12%) patients exhibiting an increase in QTc ≥ 60 milliseconds and 4 (6%) developing QTc ≥ 500 milliseconds. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac telemetry is a validated clinical tool for QTc monitoring that may serve an expanding role during the COVID-19 pandemic strengthened by its remote and continuous monitoring capability and ubiquitous presence throughout hospitals.","Kassis, Nicholas; Tanaka-Esposito, Christine; Chung, Roy; Kalra, Ankur; Shao, Mingyuan; Kumar, Ashish; Alzubi, Jafar; Chung, Mina K.; Khot, Umesh N.",J Electrocardiol,22,1

METHODS: The clinical performance of Euroimmun ELISA SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Ab ELISA, and DiaPro COVID-19 IgG confirmation were evaluated in the context of both a retrospective and a prospective analysis of COVID-19 patients. The retrospective analysis included plasma samples from 63 COVID-19 patients and 89 control (pre-pandemic) patients. The prospective study included 203 patients who tested either negative (n = 181) or positive (n = 22) by RT-PCR before serology sampling. RESULTS: The specificity was 92.1 %, 98.9 %, 100 % and 98.9 % and the sensitivity 14 days after onset of symptoms was 95.6 %, 95.6 %, 97.8 % and 95.6 % for Euroimmun IgG, Abbott IgG, Wantai Ab, and DiaPro IgG confirmation SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays, respectively. The low specificity of Euroimmun IgG (for ratio <5) was not confirmed in routine care setting (98.5 % negative agreement). Serology was complementary to RT-PCR in routine care and lead to identification of false positive (Ct>38, <2 targets detected) and false negative RT-PCR results (>1 month post onset of symptoms). CONCLUSIONS: Serology was complementary to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 at least 14 days after onset of symptoms. First line serology testing can be performed with Wantai Ab or Abbott IgG assays, while DiaPro IgG confirmation assay can be used as an efficient confirmation assay.","Marlet, Julien; Petillon, Camille; Ragot, Emma; Abou El Fattah, Yazid; Guillon, Antoine; Marchand Adam, Sylvain; Lemaignen, Adrien; Bernard, Louis; Desoubeaux, Guillaume; Blasco, Hélène; Barin, Francis; Stefic, Karl; Gaudy-Graffin, Catherine",J Clin Virol,22,16

Large retrospective studies indicate that an elevated level of inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory factors are associated with both increased disease severity and mortality. Here, using multidimensional epigenetic, transcriptional, in vitro and in vivo analyses, we report that Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibition suppresses lethal inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic treatment with two doses of Topotecan (TPT), a FDA-approved TOP1 inhibitor, suppresses infection-induced inflammation in hamsters. TPT treatment as late as four days post-infection reduces morbidity and rescues mortality in a transgenic mouse model. These results support the potential of TOP1 inhibition as an effective host-directed therapy against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. TPT and its derivatives are inexpensive clinical-grade inhibitors available in most countries. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of repurposing TOP1 inhibitors for severe COVID-19 in humans.","Yuin Ho, Jessica Sook; Wing-Yee Mok, Bobo; Campisi, Laura; Jordan, Tristan; Yildiz, Soner; Parameswaran, Sreeja; Wayman, Joseph A.; Gaudreault, Natasha N.; Meekins, David A.; Indran, Sabarish V.; Morozov, Igor; Trujillo, Jessie D.; Fstkchyan, Yesai S.; Rathnasinghe, Raveen; Zhu, Zeyu; Zheng, Simin; Zhao, Nan; White, Kris; Ray-Jones, Helen; Malysheva, Valeriya; Thiecke, Michiel J.; Lau, Siu-Ying; Liu, Honglian; Zhang, Anna Junxia; Chak-Yiu Lee, Andrew; Liu, Wen-Chun; Jangra, Sonia; Escalera, Alba; Aydillo, Teresa; Melo, Betsaida Salom; Guccione, Ernesto; Sebra, Robert; Shum, Elaine; Bakker, Jan; Kaufman, David A.; Moreira, Andre L.; Carossino, Mariano; Balasuriya, Udeni B.R.; Byun, Minji; Albrecht, Randy A.; Schotsaert, Michael; Garcia-Sastre, Adolfo; Chanda, Sumit K.; Miraldi, Emily R.; Jeyasekharan, Anand D.; TenOever, Benjamin R.; Spivakov, Mikhail; Weirauch, Matthew T.; Heinz, Sven; Chen, Honglin; Benner, Christopher; Richt, Juergen A.; Marazzi, Ivan",Cell,22,1

We carried out laparoscopic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic with intention to test our local adaptation of a laparoscopic smoke evacuator. Twenty-five laparoscopic cases for digestive surgery were performed with uneventful results. In summary, a low cost local adaptation of laparoscopic smoke and safe surgical behavior should be the standard of care when delivering laparoscopic surgery service in the pandemic era and forward.","Nugroho, Adianto; Saunar, Rofi; Lalisang, Toar J M; Wiradisuria, Errawan",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,22,1

The COVID-19 virus outbreak that occurred in Wuhan in China in December 2019 continues to increase in the middle of 2020. Within the scope of this epidemic, different contents of data are published and products for improving the treatment process. One of the major symptoms of COVID-19 epidemic disease, which was revealed by the World Health Organization, is intense cough and breathing difficulties. Chest X-ray (CXR) and computing tomography (CT) images of patients infected with COVID-19 are also a type of data that allows data scientists to work with healthcare professionals during this struggle. Fast evaluation of these images by experts is important in the days when the epidemic has suffered. This chapter focuses on artificial intelligence (AI) for a successful and rapid diagnostic recommendation as part of these deadly epidemic prevention efforts that have emerged. As a study case, a dataset of 373 CXR images, 139 of which were COVID-19 infected, collected from open sources, was used for diagnosis with deep learning approaches of COVID-19. The use of EfficientNet, an up-to-date and robust deep learning model for education, offers the possibility to become infected with an accuracy of 94.7%. Nevertheless, some limitations must be considered when producing AI solutions by making use of medical data. Using these results, a perspective is provided on the limitations of deep learning models in the diagnosis of COVID-19 from radiology images for data quality, amount of data, data privacy, explainability, and robust solutions.","Kızrak, Merve Ayyuce; Müftüoğlu, Zümrüt; Yıldırım, Tülay",Data Science for COVID-19,22,20

METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the rate of 30-day COVID-19 transmission and mortality of all surgical patients in the three hospitals in our trust in the East of England during the first lockdown in March 2020. All patients who underwent a swab were swabbed on or 24 hours prior to admission. RESULTS: There were 4,254 patients and an overall 30-day mortality of 0.99%. The excess surgical mortality in our region was 0.29%. There were 39 patients who were COVID-19 positive within 30 days of admission, 12 of whom died. All 12 were emergency admissions with a length of stay longer than 24 hours. There were three deaths among those who underwent day case surgery, one of whom was COVID-19 negative, and the other two were not swabbed but not suspected to have COVID-19. There were two COVID-19 positive elective cases and none in day case elective or emergency surgery. There were no COVID-19 positive deaths in elective or day case surgery. CONCLUSIONS: There was a low rate of COVID-19 transmission and mortality in elective and day case operations. Our data have allowed us to guide patients in the consent process and provided the evidence base to restart elective and day case operating with precautions and regular review. A number of regions will be similarly affected and should perform a review of their data for the winter period and beyond.","Parikh, S; Cooper, L; Matthews, W; Khan, M; Syed, S; Vasudevan, S P; Brosnan, C; Barr, L; Loeffler, M",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,22,20

This review aimed to scope the literature to identify what is known about the frequency and duration of e-bike use, their impact on travel behaviour, the purposes for which e-bikes are used and factors associated with e-bike use. In addition, the review aimed to identify gaps in the literature and highlight future research priorities. METHODS: A scoping review of published and unpublished literature in any language. Relevant articles were identified through searching six databases, two grey literature platforms and reference lists. Searches were conducted until August 2019. Data were extracted using a standardised extraction form and descriptive and narrative results are provided. RESULTS: Seventy-six studies met the inclusion criteria. The volume of research has increased since 2017 and primarily examines personal e-bike use, as opposed to e-bike share/rental schemes or organizational e-bike initiatives. The use of e-bikes increased the frequency and duration of cycling compared to conventional cycling and may help overcome barriers associated with conventional cycling. The uptake in e-cycling largely substitutes for conventional cycling or private car journeys, though the degree of substitution depends on the primary transport mode prior to e-bike acquisition. E-bikes are primarily used for utilitarian reasons, though older adults also engage in recreational e-cycling. Research priorities include quantitatively examining e-bike use, their impact on overall transport behaviour and identifying determinants of e-cycling to inform intervention and policy. CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that the personal use of e-bikes is associated with a reduction in motorized vehicle use, which has potential positive impacts on the environment and health. The impacts of e-bike share schemes and workplace initiatives are less well understood. Evidence describing the purposes for which e-bikes are used, and the factors associated with usage, are useful to inform e-cycling promotion policy.","Bourne, Jessica E.; Cooper, Ashley R.; Kelly, Paul; Kinnear, Fiona J.; England, Clare; Leary, Sam; Page, Angie",J Transp Health,22,16

Most human infectious diseases (60-75%) are derived from pathogens that originally circulated in non-human animal species. This demonstrates that spillover has a fundamental role in the emergence of new human infectious diseases. Understanding the factors that facilitate the transmission of pathogens from wild animals to humans is essential to establish strategies focused on the reduction of the frequency of spillover events. In this context, this article describes the basic aspects of zoonotic spillover and the main factors involved in spillover events, considering the role of the inter-species interactions, phylogenetic distance between host species, environmental drivers, and specific characteristics of the pathogens, animals, and humans. As an example, the factors involved in the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic are discussed, indicating what can be learned from this public health emergency, and what can be applied to the Brazilian scenario. Finally, this article discusses actions to prevent or reduce the frequency of zoonotic spillover events.","Ellwanger, Joel Henrique; Chies, José Artur Bogo",Genetics and molecular biology,22,26

How does media, as important variables in activating norm perception, affect pro-environmental behavior? Through an online survey of 550 randomly selected Chinese citizens, this study examines the roles of traditional media and social media in influencing the relationship between norm perception and pro-environmental behavior. Based on multi-level regression analysis of data, this study found that (1) compared with traditional media, social media play a more significant role in moderating the relationship between norm perception and pro-environmental behavior; (2) the promotion of the perception of injunctive norms by traditional media has a negative relationship with pro-environmental behaviors; (3) the activation of subjective norm perception by social media will promote pro-environmental behaviors. According to this research, in the current media environment, we should carefully release pro-environmental information on social media and encourage relevant discussions, and appropriately reduce environment-relevant injunctive normative information on traditional media. The study also discusses the role of media in regulating norm perception and pro-environmental behavior in different cultural contexts.","Han, Ruixia; Cheng, Yali",Int J Environ Res Public Health,22,1

Design Retrospective. Setting Two acute care inpatient rehabilitation hospitals (AR1 and AR2) and 1 long-term acute care hospital (LTAC). Participants Records of inpatients seen by the vision service Interventions Records from a one-year telemedicine pilot performed at AR1 and then expanded to AR2 and LTAC during COVID-19 were reviewed. In the virtual visits, an occupational therapist (OT) measured the patients’ vision with the iPad apps and forwarded results to the off-site Optometrist (OD) for review prior to a video visit. The OD provided diagnosis and education, press-on prisms, strategies and modifications, and follow-up recommendations. Providers completed the telehealth usability questionnaire (10-point scale). Main Outcome Measure(s) Vision exams per month at AR1 before and with telemedicine. Results With telemedicine at AR1, mean visits per month significantly increased from 10.7 ± 5 to 14.9 ± 5 (p=0.002). Prism was trialed in 40% of cases of which 83% were successful, similar to previously reported in-person success rates. COVID-19 caused only a marginal decrease in visits per month (p = 0.08) at AR1, whereas the site without an established program (AR2) had a 3-4 week gap in care while the program was initiated. Cases at the LTAC tended to be more complex and difficult to manage virtually. The telehealth usability questionnaire median category scores were 7 for Ease of Use, 8 for Interface Quality, 6 for Reliability, and 9 for Satisfaction and Future Use. Conclusion(s) The virtual vision clinic process improved inpatient access to eye and visual neuro-rehabilitation assessment before and during the COVID-19 quarantine and was well accepted by providers and patients.","Keilty, Matthew; Houston, Kevin E.; Collins, Caroline; Trehan, Ritika; Chen, Ya-Ting; Merabet, Lotfi; Watts, Amy; Pundlik, Shrinivas; Luo, Gang",Arch Rehabil Res Clin Transl,22,20

We compared data relative to allogeneic transplants carried out from 2018 at our center, before (n=167) or during the pandemic (n=45). We examined patient's characteristics, donor and graft types, cell doses and main transplant outcomes. Moreover, we appraised the rise of costs attributable to COVID-19-related additional procedures, as well as the risk for adverse events that these procedures conveyed to grafts or recipients. Overall, the number of transplants did not decrease during pandemic, whereas patients at high relapse risk were prioritized. Transplants were mainly from matched unrelated donors, with a significant decrease of haploidentical related donors. Moreover, the use of bone marrow as a graft for haplo-transplant was almost abandoned. Cryopreservation was introduced for all related and unrelated apheresis products, with a median storage time of 20 days. Notably, transplant outcomes (engraftment, acute graft versus host disease and non-relapse mortality) with cryopreserved products were comparable to those with fresh products. Considering that the emergency situation may persist for months, to cryopreserve allogeneic grafts can offer a lifesaving opportunity to patients whose allogeneic transplant cannot be postponed after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Valentini, Caterina Giovanna; Chiusolo, Patrizia; Bianchi, Maria; Metafuni, Elisabetta; Orlando, Nicoletta; Giammarco, Sabrina; Bacigalupo, Andrea; Sica, Simona; Teofili, Luciana",Cytotherapy,22,15
