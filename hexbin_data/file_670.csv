HTLV-1 has currently infected up to 10 million globally with highly endemic areas in Japan, Africa, the Caribbean and South America. We have previously shown that Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) enhance HTLV-1 transmission by promoting cell–cell contact. RESULTS: Here, we separated EVs into subpopulations using differential ultracentrifugation (DUC) at speeds of 2 k (2000×g), 10 k (10,000×g), and 100 k (100,000×g) from infected cell supernatants. Proteomic analysis revealed that EVs contain the highest viral/host protein abundance in the 2 k subpopulation (2 k > 10 k > 100 k). The 2 k and 10 k populations contained viral proteins (i.e., p19 and Tax), and autophagy proteins (i.e., LC3 and p62) suggesting presence of autophagosomes as well as core histones. Interestingly, the use of 2 k EVs in an angiogenesis assay (mesenchymal stem cells + endothelial cells) caused deterioration of vascular-like-tubules. Cells commonly associated with the neurovascular unit (i.e., astrocytes, neurons, and macrophages) in the blood–brain barrier (BBB) showed that HTLV-1 EVs may induce expression of cytokines involved in migration (i.e., IL-8; 100 k > 2 k > 10 k) from astrocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (i.e., IL-8; 2 k > 10 k). Finally, we found that EVs were able to promote cell–cell contact and viral transmission in monocytic cell-derived dendritic cell. The EVs from both 2 k and 10 k increased HTLV-1 spread in a humanized mouse model, as evidenced by an increase in proviral DNA and RNA in the Blood, Lymph Node, and Spleen. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these data suggest that various EV subpopulations induce cytokine expression, tissue damage, and viral spread.","Pinto, Daniel O.; Al Sharif, Sarah; Mensah, Gifty; Cowen, Maria; Khatkar, Pooja; Erickson, James; Branscome, Heather; Lattanze, Thomas; DeMarino, Catherine; Alem, Farhang; Magni, Ruben; Zhou, Weidong; Alais, Sandrine; Dutartre, Hélène; El-Hage, Nazira; Mahieux, Renaud; Liotta, Lance A.; Kashanchi, Fatah",Retrovirology,670,30

Legislation intended to improve access to personal data across national borders has proven to be a double-edged sword, where complexity and implications from misinterpretations have paradoxically resulted in data becoming more siloed. As a result, the potential for development of health specific AI and clinical decision support tools built on real-world data have yet to be fully realized. In this perspective, we propose federated networks as a solution to enable access to diverse data sets and tackle known and emerging health problems. The perspective draws on experience from the World Economic Forum Breaking Barriers to Health Data project, the Personal Health Train and Vantage6 infrastructures, and industry insights. We first define the concept of federated networks in a healthcare context, present the value they can bring to multiple stakeholders, and discuss their establishment, operation and implementation. Challenges of federated networks in healthcare are highlighted, as well as the resulting need for and value of an independent orchestrator for their safe, sustainable and scalable implementation.","Hallock, Harry; Marshall, Serena Elizabeth; 't Hoen, Peter A.

Here, we isolated a strain of PDCoV from intestinal content of a piglet with severe watery diarrhea on a farm located in Henan Province, named PDCoV strain HNZK-02. Subsequently, the complete genomes of cell-cultured PDCoV HNZK-02 passage 5 and 15 were sequenced and analyzed. There was a continuous 3-nucleotide deletion and 7 amino acid changes in S genes when compared with the other reported PDCoVs. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based transcriptome analysis was used to quantitatively identify differentially expressed genes after PDCoV infection in ST cells. In total, 523 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including 62 upregulated genes and 457 downregulated genes. The 62 upregulated genes were associated with TNF signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling, chemokine signaling pathway and NF-κB signaling pathway. The significant expressing changed genes, including three antiviral genes (Mx1, OASL, OAS1) and three inflammatory chemokine related genes (CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL10) were further validated using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. It showed the consistent expression patterns of the candidate genes with those from RNA-seq. Our results demonstrated that PDCoV infection activates NF-κB signaling pathway and leads to the expression of inflammatory factors, which may be related to TLRs but TLR2 is not a critical factor.In general, these results can help us to confirm the molecular regulation mechanism and also provide us a comprehensive resource of PDCoV infection.","Jin, Xiao-Hui; Zhang, Yun-Fei; Yuan, Yi-Xin; Han, Li; Zhang, Gai-Ping; Hu, Hui",Molecular immunology,670,24

Methods Kawasaki City, Japan, has six comprehensive stroke centers (CSCs) and six primary stroke centers (PSCs). In CSCs, endovascular therapy can be carried out 24 h a day, 7 days a week, but not in PSCs. There is no ""drip and ship"" protocol for further endovascular therapy from PSCs to CSCs. We determined the predictive value of MPSS scoring by the EMTs for the performance of endovascular therapy after transportation. Results There were 2031 patients (mean age, 71.1 ± 13.3 years) registered from April 2012 to March 2015. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the MPSS score and type of stroke center were independent predictors for performance of endovascular therapy. In particular, the odds ratio (OR) for endovascular therapy was significant for MPSS score 3 (OR, 2.914; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.152-7.372; P = 0.024), MPSS score 4 (OR, 5.474; 95%CI, 2.300-13.029; P = 0.000), and MPSS score 5 (OR, 11.459; 95%CI, 4.334-30.296; P = 0.000) when MPSS score 1 was set as a reference. The diagnostic accuracy of the MPSS score evaluated by EMTs was 0.689 (95%CI, 0.627-0.751). Conclusions Prehospital triage using MPSS scores evaluated by EMTs can predict the likelihood of performance of endovascular therapy after transportation, and may become a tool offering a flexible solution for designing a new transportation protocol.","Suzuki, Yu; Hasegawa, Yasuhiro; Tsumura, Kohtaro; Ueda, Toshihiro; Suzuki, Kazunari; Sugiyama, Makoto; Nozaki, Hiroyuki; Kawaguchi, Shojiro; Nakane, Makoto; Nagashima, Goro; Kitamura, Takayuki; Yokomine, Kengo; Sasanuma, Jinichi",Acute medicine & surgery,670,1

The use of this technique can reduce postoperative pain and length of stay and gives the surgeon the same operative perspective as open surgery. METHODS We retrospectively analysed the data of 73 patients who underwent uniportal VATS lobectomies from November 2014 to December 2015 in our institution. We divided the patients in two groups (group 1: first 30 patients vs. group 2: established phase, 43 patients) to compare and evaluate the data regarding the learning curve. To explore evolution of learning curve, data were plotted to calculate Spearman's Rank-Order Correlation. R (version 3.2.3) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS The median age was 69.9 (group 1) and 68.8 (group 2) years. Mean operative time was 84.9±33.0 (group 1) and 84.8±31.5 (group 2) minutes. The conversion rate was 13.3% in group 1 vs. 9.3% in group 2, showing a significant learning reduction (rho=0.590). Overall morbidity rate was 15.1%. The most common complication consisted in prolonged air leak. Interpolation line of complications showed a significant decrease due to learning curve (rho=0.676). The median length of stay was 4 days in group 1 vs. 3 days in group 2. The 30-day mortality was 3.3% in group 1 and 0% in group 2. CONCLUSIONS The comparison between the groups showed that the median length of stay, operative time, conversion rate and 30-day mortality statistically significantly improved in the established phase. Also, complications like prolonged air leak were decreasing in the established phase. In conclusion, the uniportal VATS lobectomy technique can be performed safely from experienced surgeons without major complications and with an acceptable mortality rate.","Bedetti, Benedetta; Bertolaccini, Luca; Solli, Piergiorgio; Scarci, Marco",Journal of thoracic disease,670,17

METHODS This was a prospective observational trial with waiver of consent conducted in the intensive care unit of Level I trauma center in 94 mechanically ventilated trauma patients sedated with propofol alone or in combination with midazolam. BIS, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), electromyography, and heart rate variability, as a test of autonomic function, were measured for 45 minutes during daily SATs. Data were evaluated with analysis of variance, linear regression, and nonparametric tests. RESULTS The BIS wave form coincided almost exactly with propofol on/off. Steady-state BIS correlated with RASS (p < 0.0001) and with propofol dose (p < 0.0001), but the strengths of association were relatively low (all r(2) < 0.5). BIS wave form was not altered by age, heart rate, or heart rate variability and was similar with propofol alone or propofol plus midazolam, but the presence of brain injury or the use of paralytics shifted the curve downward (both p < 0.001). The overall test characteristics for BIS versus RASS without neuromuscular blockade were sensitivity: 90% versus 77% (p = 0.034); specificity: 90% versus 75% (p = 0.021); positive predictive value: 90% versus 76% (p = 0.021), and negative predictive value: 90% versus 76% (p = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS In the first trial in trauma patients and largest trial in any surgical population, the (1) BIS was reliable and has advantages over RASS of being continuous and objective, at least during a propofol SAT; (2) BIS interpretation remains somewhat subjective in patients receiving paralytic agents or with traumatic brain injury.","Ogilvie, Michael P; Pereira, Bruno M T; Ryan, Mark L; Gomez-Rodriguez, Juan Carlos; Pierre, Edgar J; Livingstone, Alan S; Proctor, Kenneth G",The Journal of trauma,670,16

This gives access to the middle ear for sampling, flushing and instilling topical therapy. It should be considered whenever the TM is intact and there is clinical evidence of otitis media, abnormal TMs and/or abnormal diagnostic imaging. Samples should be collected for cytological investigation and culture, and then the external ear should be cleaned and dried (if required). Myringotomies should be performed under general anaesthesia and, wherever possible, using a video otoscope; the enhanced view and instrument ports facilitate the technique and reduce the risk of complications. The myringotomy incision should be made in the caudoventral quadrant of the TM using an appropriately sized urinary catheter to collect samples and flush the middle ear cavity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Cases with successful recanalization of the primary occlusion site (POS) with either of the techniques were analyzed (n = 36 ADAPT, n = 61 stent retriever). The primary endpoint was the evaluation of intraprocedural thrombus fragmentation before applying additional maneuvers to enhance reperfusion success. Grading was performed using the modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) perfusion scale grade with the implementation of an additional TICI 2c grade. Secondary endpoints were procedural complications and clinical data. RESULTS After opening of the POS, 83.3% successful reperfusions were reached using the ADAPT technique and 88.5% using stent retrievers (p = 0.47). Subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH) appeared only when using stent retrievers (16.4 vs. 0%, p = 0.010). The number of maneuvers was significantly higher (median 2 vs. 1, p = 0.006), and procedural time was longer in the stent retriever group (median 30 vs. 13 min, p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference between both techniques with regard to the occurrence of embolizations to new territories (2.8 vs. 8.2%, p = 0.28). CONCLUSION When retrieving of the primary thrombus is possible, ADAPT results in comparable reperfusion grades as do stent retrievers. This suggests that comparable distraction forces act on the thrombus and that both techniques possess a comparable risk of periprocedural thrombus fragmentation. SAH exclusively occurred after using stent retrievers, which may further promote ADAPT as safe and fast initial front-line approach.","Maegerlein, Christian; Prothmann, Sascha; Lucia, Kristin Elizabeth; Zimmer, Claus; Friedrich, Benjamin; Kaesmacher, Johannes",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,670,31

Preventing hypoxemia by optimizing lung aeration during sleep remains a challenge. OBJECTIVES To explore safety, feasibility, and tolerability of noninvasive, bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation (BiPAP) as preventative, supportive care for hospitalized, medically stable children with SCD on a general pediatric inpatient unit. METHODS Retrospective chart review of patients ≤22 years of age with SCD admitted to the general pediatric inpatient unit from February 1, 2017 to March 1, 2020 for whom BiPAP was recommended as supportive care. Hospitalizations were excluded if patients were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), required BiPAP for respiratory failure, or used BiPAP at home for obstructive sleep apnea. RESULTS Twenty-three patients had 53 hospitalizations in which BiPAP was recommended. Fifty-two (98%) hospitalizations included acute SCD pain. Indications for BiPAP included prior ACS (94%), chest or back pain (79%), and/or oxygen desaturation (66%). On 17 occasions, patients already had mild to moderate ACS but were stable when BiPAP was recommended. BiPAP was used successfully during 75% of hospitalizations for a median of two nights. There were no adverse effects associated with BiPAP. PICU transfer for respiratory support occurred during three hospitalizations. In 26 hospitalizations of children at risk for ACS who tolerated BiPAP, 23 (88%) did not develop ACS. CONCLUSIONS BiPAP is safe, feasible, and well tolerated as supportive care for hospitalized children with SCD. Next steps include an intervention trial to further assess the efficacy of BiPAP on ACS prevention.","Guenther, Cara S; Pae, Victoria J; Neri, Caitlin M; Barry, Karan; Duggan, Molly A; Cohen, Robyn T",Pediatric blood & cancer,670,8

We examined whether the incidence of cardiovascular disease in Look AHEAD varied by changes in weight or fitness. METHODS Look AHEAD was a randomised clinical trial done at 16 clinical sites in the USA, recruiting patients from Aug 22, 2001, to April 30, 2004. In the trial, 5145 overweight or obese adults aged 45-76 years with type 2 diabetes were assigned (1:1) to an intensive lifestyle intervention or diabetes support and education. In this observational, post-hoc analysis, we examined the association of magnitude of weight loss and fitness change over the first year with incidence of cardiovascular disease. The primary outcome of the trial and of this analysis was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or admission to hospital for angina. The secondary outcome included the same indices plus coronary artery bypass grafting, carotid endartectomy, percutaneous coronary intervention, hospitalisation for congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, or total mortality. We adjusted analyses for baseline differences in weight or fitness, demographic characteristics, and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The Look AHEAD trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00017953. FINDINGS For the analyses related to weight change, we excluded 311 ineligible participants, leaving a population of 4834; for the analyses related to fitness change, we excluded 739 participants, leaving a population of 4406. In analyses of the full cohort (ie, combining both study groups), over a median 10·2 years of follow-up (IQR 9·5-10·7), individuals who lost at least 10% of their bodyweight in the first year of the study had a 21% lower risk of the primary outcome (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0·79, 95% CI 0·64-0·98; p=0·034) and a 24% reduced risk of the secondary outcome (adjusted HR 0·76, 95% CI 0·63-0·91; p=0·003) compared with individuals with stable weight or weight gain. Achieving an increase of at least 2 metabolic equivalents in fitness change was associated with a significant reduction in the secondary outcome (adjusted HR 0·77, 95% CI 0·61-0·96; p=0·023) but not the primary outcome (adjusted HR 0·78, 0·60-1·03; p=0·079). In analyses treating the control group as the reference group, participants in the intensive lifestyle intervention group who lost at least 10% of their bodyweight had a 20% lower risk of the primary outcome (adjusted HR 0·80, 95% CI 0·65-0·99; p=0·039), and a 21% lower risk of the secondary outcome (adjusted HR 0·79, 95% CI 0·66-0·95; p=0·011); however, change in fitness was not significantly associated with a change in the primary outcome. INTERPRETATION The results of this post-hoc analysis of Look AHEAD suggest an association between the magnitude of weight loss and incidence of cardiovascular disease in people with type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest a need to continue to refine approaches to identify individuals who are most likely to benefit from lifestyle interventions and to develop strategies to improve the magnitude of sustained weight loss with lifestyle interventions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS An open, one-stage, comparative study involving 64 patients with hypertension and 47 without hypertension at the age of 40 to 59 years. All patients underwent physical examination, assessment of cardiovascular risk (CVR), 24-hour blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), echocardiography (ECHOCG), color duplex scanning of brachiocephalic arteries. RESULTS Patients with hypertension and comparison groups were comparable in age, sex, smoking, history of myocardial infarction. 1st degree of hypertension was present in 26.6%, 2nd in 40.6%, 3rd in 12.5% of patients. Obesity was detected in 24.3% of patients and all patients with obesity had AH. The SCORE score in individuals with hypertension was 4.94.5; in the comparison group, 2.32.6 (p0.001). Non-stenosing atherosclerosis was present in 54.8% and 88%, p=0.020, and atherosclerotic plaque in the vascular lumen was present in 45.3% and 12% of patients with and without hypertension, respectively (p0.001). 68.8% were constantly treated, and the target BP was reached in 31.3% of patients with hypertension. Male gender (OR 1.68; 95% CI 1.6828.49; p=0.007), obesity (OR 4.78; 95% CI 1.1420.29; p=0.033), concomitant pathology (OR 3.09; 95% CI 1.029.37; p=0.046) were negative, and dyslipidemia (OR 0.10; 95% CI 0.010.84; p=0.033) was positive, affecting the achievement of the target level of blood pressure. CONCLUSION The target level of blood pressure was achieved in 31.3% of outpatients with hypertension, mainly in women. Among patients who did not reach the target level of blood pressure, men, individuals with high SSR and obesity predominated. Concomitant pathology and obesity are negative, and dyslipidemia was positively associated with the achievement of the target level of blood pressure, which must be taken into account when developing measures for prevention and treatment.","Larina, V N; Fedorova, E V; Mikhailusova, M P; Golovko, M G",Terapevticheskii arkhiv,670,33

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research articles for the current study were searched over PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE and Web of Science online databases. The keywords used were: ((""SARS-CoV-2"" OR ""COVID-19"") AND (""mutation"" OR ""variant"") AND (""death"" OR ""hospitalization"" OR ""infection"" OR ""transmission"") AND (""antibody"" OR ""neutralize"" OR ""vaccine"")). A total of 333 research articles were retrieved through online-database search. These articles were further scrutinized for their relevancy. Additionally, searches were performed to find the latest relevant information over Google search engine and relevant news browsers. Finally, around 35 germane articles were considered for scripting the current report. RESULTS: The mutations have changed amino acids at key positions in spike protein viz. S477N, E484K, Q677H, E484Q, L452R, K417T, K417N and N501Y. These mutations are relevant for different characteristics and are present in newly evolved strains of SARS-CoV-2 like E484K in B.1.526, B.1.525, P.2, B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351. Mutations have increased the immune escape potential leading to 3.5-6.5-folds decrease in neutralization of antibodies (Pfizer and Moderna vaccines). The variant, B.1.617 circulating in India and many other countries (double variant) having E484Q and L452R mutations, has raised the infection rate and decreased the neutralization capacity of the vaccine-induced antibodies. Deadly K417N+E484K+N501Y triplet mutations found in B.1.351 and P.1 have increased the transmission ability of these strains by 50% leading to greater COVID-19 hospitalization, ICU admissions and deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The new SARS-CoV-2 variants have compromised the neutralization potential of the currently used vaccines, but still, they have considerable efficacy to reduce infection and mortality.

Or Fight?,21.726805,1.61821,2019,"INTRODUCTION Fever is associated with a poor outcome in severely brain-injured patients, and its control is one of the therapies used in this condition. But, fever suppression may promote infection, and severely brain-injured patients are frequently exposed to infectious diseases, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Therefore, we designed a study to explore the role of a fever control protocol in VAP development during neuro-intensive care. METHODS An observational study was performed on severely brain-injured patients hospitalized in a university ICU. The primary goal was to assess whether fever control was a risk factor for VAP in a prospective cohort in which a fever control protocol was applied and in a historical control group. Moreover, the density of VAP incidence was compared between the two groups. The statistical analysis was based on a competing risk model multivariate analysis. RESULTS The study included 189 brain-injured patients (intervention group, n = 98, and historical control group, n = 91). The use of a fever control protocol was an independent risk factor for VAP (hazard ratio 2.73, 95% confidence interval (1.38, 5.38; P = 0.005)). There was a significant increase in the incidence of VAP in patients treated with a fever control protocol (26.1 versus 12.5 VAP cases per 1000 days of mechanical ventilation). In cases in which a fever control protocol was applied for > 3 days, we observed a higher rate of VAP in comparison with the rate among patients treated for ≤ 3 days. CONCLUSIONS Fever control in brain-injured patients was a major risk factor for VAP occurrence, particularly when applied for > 3 days.","Launey, Yoann; Nesseler, Nicolas; Le Cousin, Audren; Feuillet, Fanny; Garlantezec, Ronan; Mallédant, Yannick; Seguin, Philippe",Critical care,670,8

While both approaches have strengths and limitations, we believe that the narrative of RCTs vs RWD is a false narrative. Clearly, both approaches are needed to capture the totality of evidence and answer critical clinical questions in as comprehensive and timely manner as possible. They represent complementary approaches which often appear synergistic with one another. RCTs are generally slow and costly to develop and conduct and limited by the eligible and accrued population included while RWD is subject to confounding by both unknown factors as well as known factors not available in the data at hand. At the same time, not all RWD are created equal with the gold standard for RWD represented by prospective cohort studies designed a priori to capture specific data to answer important pressing questions. A great strength of RWD is the ability to capture information on large numbers of individuals at speed and scale. It is essential to acknowledge, however, that while larger numbers may enhance the precision of the effect estimates provided, in and of themselves, larger numbers do not increase the accuracy of estimates if patient selection and other biases have crept in. While we have become increasingly sophisticated in efforts to adjust for such potential bias, the risk of residual confounding remains including confounding my indication with patients with greater illness more likely to receive certain treatments based on clinical judgment rather than by randomization. Nevertheless, in crises situations, like a pandemic, it is important to gather as much information on risk factors and complications including mortality as rapidly as possible to inform clinical and public health decision making and provide a solid framework for clinical trials that follow. We need both carefully designed, conducted and interpreted RCTs and RWD to definitively answer critical questions rapidly in times of crises like COVID-19 and in a real-world setting.","Lyman, Gary H; Kuderer, Nicole M",Cancer investigation,670,31

Traditionally, protein interactions have been elucidated by experimental methods or, with lower impact, by simulation with protein docking algorithms. This article describes features and applications of the BiGGER docking algorithm, which stands at the interface of these two approaches. BiGGER is a user-friendly docking algorithm that was specifically designed to incorporate experimental data at different stages of the simulation, to either guide the search for correct structures or help evaluate the results, in order to combine the reliability of hard data with the convenience of simulations. Herein, the applications of BiGGER are described by illustrative applications divided in three Case Studies: (Case Study A) in which no specific contact data is available; (Case Study B) when different experimental data (e.g., site-directed mutagenesis, properties of the complex, NMR chemical shift perturbation mapping, electron tunneling) on one of the partners is available; and (Case Study C) when experimental data are available for both interacting surfaces, which are used during the search and/or evaluation stage of the docking. This algorithm has been extensively used, evidencing its usefulness in a wide range of different biological research fields.","Almeida, Rui M; Dell'Acqua, Simone; Krippahl, Ludwig; Moura, José J G; Pauleta, Sofia R",Molecules,670,16

Objective methods enable to measure sphere-cylindrical refraction of the eye. If we want to prescribe new glasses or contact lenses we usually use subjective methods. The aim of this study was to measure sensitivity and specificity of some subjective and objective methods for examination of the eye astigmatism. We supposed that automatic objective refraction will be the most exact method so we choose this method as the reference method. For comparison we chose subjective methods Jackson crossed cylinders (JCC), fogging method (FM) and objective method Spot Vision Screener (SVS, WelschAllyn). MATERIALS AND METHODS We had in total 30 subjects with average age 23 years (SD 1 year) in our study. We made each measurement per eye separately and it was independent measurement so we could use measurement from each eye (n = 60). Each eye was firstly measured by subjective method FM, followed by JCC method and finally was use objective method Spot Vision Screener (SVS, WelschAllyn). Measurement with objective instrument TRK-1P (TOPCON) was use as reference measurement. The significance level was set at p = 0.05. RESULTS In variable FM we measured sensitivity 76.2 % and specificity 66.7 %. Criterion for positive finding was -0.25 D. Result was statistically significant on level p < 0.001. In variable JCC we measured sensitivity 95.2 % and specificity 66.7 %. Criterion for positive finding was -0.25 D. Result was statistically significant on level p < 0.001. In variable SVS we measured sensitivity 47.6 % and specificity 94.4 %. Criterion for positive finding was -0.75 D. Result was statistically significant on level p < 0.001. Direct comparison of all methods showed statistically important difference between techniques JCC and FM (p = 0.0095). In other method we did not find statistically important difference (FM vs. SVS, p = 0.526 and JCC vs. SVS, p = 0.105). CONCLUSION All subjective and objective techniques were statistically significant in detection of eye astigmatism. Comparison of ROC curves showed statistically significant difference between FM and JCC technique. The JCC method showed the highest sensitivity, whereas SVS highest specificity.","Veselý, P; Petrová, S; Beneš, P",Ceska a slovenska oftalmologie : casopis Ceske oftalmologicke spolecnosti a Slovenske oftalmologicke spolecnosti,670,32

This allows us to find the expected size of the giant connected component (GCC) of two sequential bond percolation processes in which the bond occupancy probability of the second process is modulated (increased or decreased) by a node being inside or outside of the GCC created by the first process. In the context of epidemic spreading this amounts to both an antagonistic partial immunity and a synergistic partial coinfection interaction between the two sequential diseases. We examine configuration model networks with tunable clustering. We find that the emergent evolutionary behavior of the second strain is highly dependent on the details of the coupling between the strains. Contact clustering generally reduces the outbreak size of the second strain relative to unclustered topologies; however, positive assortativity induced by clustered contacts inverts this conclusion for highly transmissible disease dynamics.","Mann, Peter; Smith, V Anne; Mitchell, John B O; Dobson, Simon",Physical review.

The highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission presents diversity of human host and increased disease risk with advancing age, highlighting the importance of in depth understanding of its biological properties. Structural analyses have elucidated hot spots in viral binding domains, mutations and specific proteins in the host such as the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to be implicated in cell entry and viral infectivity. Furthermore, epigenetic changes that regulate chromatin structure have shown a major impact in genome stabilization and maintenance of cellular homeostasis and they have been implicated in the pathophysiology of the virus infection. Epigenetic research has revealed that global DNA methylation along with ACE2 gene methylation and post-translational histone modifications may drive differences in host tissue-, biological age- and sex-biased patterns of viral infection. Moreover, modulation of the host cells epigenetic landscape following infection represents a molecular tool used by viruses to antagonize cellular signaling as well as sensing components that regulate induction of the host innate immune and antiviral defense programs in order to enhance viral replication and infection efficiency. In this review, we provide an update of the main research findings at the interface of epigenetics and coronavirus infection. In particular, we highlight the epigenetic factors that interfere with viral replication and infection and may contribute to COVID-19 susceptibility, offering new ways of thinking in respect to host viral response.","Chlamydas, Sarantis; Papavassiliou, Athanasios G; Piperi, Christina",Epigenetics,670,4

Although dozens of different anti-emetics are available for clinical practice, there is currently no comparative ranking of efficacy and safety of these drugs to inform clinical practice. We performed a systematic review with network meta-analyses to compare, and rank in terms of efficacy and safety, single anti-emetic drugs and their combinations, including 5-hydroxytryptamine3 , dopamine-2 and neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists; corticosteroids; antihistamines; and anticholinergics used to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting in adults after general anaesthesia. We systematically searched for placebo-controlled and head-to-head randomised controlled trials up to November 2017 (updated in April 2020). We assessed how trustworthy the evidence was using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and Confidence In Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) approaches for vomiting within 24 h postoperatively, serious adverse events, any adverse event and drug class-specific side-effects. We included 585 trials (97,516 participants, 83% women) testing 44 single drugs and 51 drug combinations. The studies' overall risk of bias was assessed as low in only 27% of the studies. In 282 trials, 29 out of 36 drug combinations and 10 out of 28 single drugs lowered the risk of vomiting at least 20% compared with placebo. In the ranking of treatments, combinations of drugs were generally more effective than single drugs. Single neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists were as effective as other drug combinations. Out of the 10 effective single drugs, certainty of evidence was high for aprepitant, with risk ratio (95%CI) 0.26 (0.18-0.38); ramosetron, 0.44 (0.32-0.59); granisetron, 0.45 (0.38-0.54); dexamethasone, 0.51 (0.44-0.57); and ondansetron, 0.55 (0.51-0.60). It was moderate for fosaprepitant, 0.06 (0.02-0.21) and droperidol, 0.61 (0.54-0.69). Granisetron and amisulpride are likely to have little or no increase in any adverse event compared with placebo, while dimenhydrinate and scopolamine may increase the number of patients with any adverse event compared with placebo. So far, there is no convincing evidence that other single drugs effect the incidence of serious, or any, adverse events when compared with placebo. Among drug class specific side-effects, evidence for single drugs is mostly not convincing. There is convincing evidence regarding the prophylactic effect of at least seven single drugs for postoperative vomiting such that future studies investigating these drugs will probably not change the estimated beneficial effect. However, there is still considerable lack of evidence regarding safety aspects that does warrant investigation.","Weibel, S; Schaefer, M S; Raj, D; Rücker, G; Pace, N L; Schlesinger, T; Meybohm, P; Kienbaum, P; Eberhart, L H J; Kranke, P",Anaesthesia,670,24

Some suggest gastric ischaemic preconditioning may reduce ischaemic complications. We discuss our series of 155 consecutive minimally invasive oesophagectomies (MIOs), including a number of cases of gastric tube ischaemia, of which 4 (2.6%) developed conduit necrosis. METHODS Data were collected prospectively of MIOs carried out by a single surgeon between 2005 and 2011. Cases of gastric tube necrosis were identified. RESULTS Overall, 155 patients were identified. The inpatient mortality rate was 2.6%. Gastric tube necrosis occurred in four patients (2.6%). An ultrasonic dissector injury to the gastroepiploic arcade had occurred in two cases. In another case, the gastric tube was strangulated in the hiatus. In the remaining case, no clear mechanical cause was identified. All 4 cases occurred within the first 73 cases. The gastric tube necrosis rate of the first 50 cases versus cases 51-155 was 4% and 2% respectively (p=0.5948). The anastomotic leak rate in these two cohorts was 18% and 7% respectively (p=0.0457). There was a significant reduction in overall gastric tube complications from 22% to 10% following the learning curve of the initial 50 cases (p=0.0447). CONCLUSIONS In our series, gastric tube necrosis appears to be a learning curve issue. Prophylactic measures such as ischaemic preconditioning become less relevant as the operating surgeon's experience increases. Instead, meticulous attention to preserving the gastroepiploic arcade, avoidance of tension in the tube and careful positioning of the gastric conduit through an adequately sized hiatus are key factors.","Ramage, L; Deguara, J; Davies, A; Hamouda, A; Tsigritis, K; Forshaw, M; Botha, A J",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,670,1

This study examines the factors that led to the receipt of user fee exemption cards, and the effect of card possession on the utilisation of healthcare services. Methods: A panel data set of 1652 randomly selected ultra-poor individuals was used. Logistic regression was applied on the end line data to identify factors associated with the receipt of user fee exemption cards. Random-effects modelling was applied to the panel data to determine the effect of the card possession on healthcare service utilisation among those who reported an illness six months before the surveys. Results: Out of the ultra-poor surveyed in 2017, 75.51% received exemption cards. Basic literacy (p = 0.03), living within 5 km from a healthcare centre (p = 0.02) and being resident in Diébougou or Gourcy (p = 0.00) were positively associated with card possession. Card possession did not increase health service utilisation (β = -0.07; 95% CI = -0.45; 0.32; p = 0.73). Conclusion: A better intervention design and implementation is required.

However, the RNA-binding mechanism is poorly understood. We have shown previously that the N protein contains two structural domains--the N-terminal domain (NTD; residues 45 to 181) and the C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD; residues 248 to 365)--flanked by long stretches of disordered regions accounting for almost half of the entire sequence. Small-angle X-ray scattering data show that the protein is in an extended conformation and that the two structural domains of the SARS-CoV N protein are far apart. Both the NTD and the CTD have been shown to bind RNA. Here we show that all disordered regions are also capable of binding to RNA. Constructs containing multiple RNA-binding regions showed Hill coefficients greater than 1, suggesting that the N protein binds to RNA cooperatively. The effect can be explained by the ""coupled-allostery"" model, devised to explain the allosteric effect in a multidomain regulatory system. Although the N proteins of different coronaviruses share very low sequence homology, the physicochemical features described above may be conserved across different groups of Coronaviridae. The current results underscore the important roles of multisite nucleic acid binding and intrinsic disorder in N protein function and RNP packaging.","Chang, Chung-Ke; Hsu, Yen-Lan; Chang, Yuan-Hsiang; Chao, Fa-An; Wu, Ming-Chya; Huang, Yu-Shan; Hu, Chin-Kun; Huang, Tai-Huang",Journal of virology,670,1

CblC was previously shown to be due to mutations in the MMACHC gene, which encodes a protein thought to function in intracellular cobalamin trafficking and biosynthesis of adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) and methylcobalamin (MeCbl). These coenzymes are required for the production of succinyl-CoA and methionine, respectively. However, it is currently unclear whether additional roles for MMACHC exist outside of cobalamin metabolism. Furthermore, due to a lack of sufficient animal models, the exact pathophysiology of cblC remains unknown. Here, we report the generation and characterization of two new mouse models to study the role of MMACHC in vivo. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing was used to develop an Mmachc floxed allele (Mmachcflox/flox), which we validated as a conditional null. For a gain-of-function approach, we generated a transgenic mouse line that over-expresses functional Mmachc (Mmachc-OE+/tg) capable of rescuing Mmachc homozygous mutant lethality. Surprisingly, our data also suggest that these mice may exhibit a partially penetrant maternal-effect rescue, which might have implications for in utero therapeutic interventions to treat cblC. Both the Mmachcflox/flox and Mmachc-OE+/tg mouse models will be valuable resources for understanding the biological roles of MMACHC in a variety of tissue contexts and allow for deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of cblC.","Chern, Tiffany; Achilleos, Annita; Tong, Xuefei; Hsu, Chih-Wei; Wong, Leeyean; Poché, Ross A",Developmental biology,670,0

METHODS An observational, retrospective, and pharmacovigilance study based on the FAERS database collected between January 2014 and December 2019 was conducted. ICI-related AEs were defined as adverse reactions in patients using anti-PD-1 (nivolumab and pembrolizumab), anti-PD-L1 (atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab), and anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab and tremelimumab). Neurologic AEs previously reported to be associated with ICI were evaluated in the disproportionality analysis using the reporting odds ratio (ROR). RESULTS Among 50,406 ICI-related reports, 3619 (7.2%) neurological case was found: 1985 with anti-PD-1, 372 with anti-PD-L1, 366 with anti-CTLA-4, and 896 with the combination of ICIs. In comparison to non-ICI drug use, ICI use demonstrated higher risk for neurologic complication, including hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, myasthenia gravis, encephalitis/myelitis, meningitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, vasculitis, and neuropathy. The risk of neurologic AEs associated with ICI combination therapy was as high as or even higher than ICI monotherapy, most significantly in hypophysitis/hypopituitarism. The proportion of serious neurological events and death related to combination therapy has been decreasing in recent years. Older age, male and female sex, and metastasis were not significant risk factors for the incidence of neurologic ICI-related AEs. Patients at older age, with melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer, or on dual ICI therapy may be at higher risk of fatal neurologic AEs. CONCLUSION ICI use is associated with a higher risk of neurological complications, with dual ICI therapy posing a higher risk, while older age, sex, or metastasis were not. Patients at older age, with certain cancer types, or on dual ICI therapy may be at higher risk of fatal neurologic AEs.","Mikami, Takahisa; Liaw, Bobby; Asada, Mizuho; Niimura, Takahiro; Zamami, Yoshito; Green-LaRoche, Deborah; Pai, Lori; Levy, Michael; Jeyapalan, Suriya",Journal of neuro-oncology,670,7

This system produces an equal amount of each viral protein, though their required amounts are different. In this study, we found that the extra membrane-anchored non-structural (NS) proteins of Japanese encephalitis virus and dengue virus are rapidly and selectively degraded by the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Our gene targeting study revealed that ERAD involving Derlin2 and SEL1L, but not Derlin1, is required for the viral genome replication. Derlin2 predominantly localized in the convoluted membrane (CM) of viral replication organelle, and viral NS proteins degraded in the CM. Hence, these results suggest that viral protein homeostasis is regulated by Derlin2-mediated ERAD in the CM, and this process is critical for the propagation of these viruses.ImportanceThe results of this study reveal that the cellular ERAD system controls the amount of each viral protein in virus-infected cells; this ""viral protein homeostasis"" is critical for viral propagation. Furthermore, we clarified that the ""convoluted membrane (CM),"" which was previously considered a structure with unknown function, serves as a kind of waste dump where viral protein degradation occurs. We also found that the Derlin2/Sel1L/HRD1-specific pathway is involved in this process, whereas the Derlin1-mediated pathway is not. This novel ERAD-mediated fine-tuning system for the stoichiometries of polyprotein-derived viral proteins may represent a common feature among polyprotein-encoding viruses.","Tabata, Keisuke; Arakawa, Masashi; Ishida, Kotaro; Kobayashi, Makiko; Nara, Atsuki; Sugimoto, Takehiro; Okada, Tetsuya; Mori, Kazutoshi; Morita, Eiji",Journal of virology,670,1

Recent reports call into question in utero or peripartum viral transmission to the offspring. Few data are available on IgG and/or IgM in newborn. Insufficient evidence is available regarding passive immunity in neonates born from SARS-CoV-2 infected women. CASE We report a case of a neonate showing the presence of blood specific IgG and the absence of IgM and negative nasopharyngeal swab. He was born from an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected mother with positive IgG and IgM. CONCLUSION The transplacental passage of specific IgG antibodies from the affected mother to the unaffected fetus highlights neonatal passive immunity. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS The COVID-19 TCM treatment plan and syndrome related literature published before February 24, 2020 was searched and a database was established. TCM common syndrome characteristics of COVID-19 were analyzed by the method of latent structure and system clustering combined with frequency and constituent ratio, which were conducted by Lantern 5.0 and SPSS 20.0. RESULTS Forty-two literatures about treatment plans, and 212 syndromes records were enrolled. Latent structure model was established based on 53 symptoms with frequency over 10, and 14 latent variables and 7 syndromes were concluded by comprehensive clustering, including syndrome of pathogenic heat invading lung, internal block and outward desertion, syndrome of dampness heat accumulating lung, syndrome of Qi and Yin deficiency, syndrome of epidemic virus closing lung, syndrome of cold dampness closing lung and syndrome of Qi deficiency of lung and spleen. Factor analysis was conducted for 53 symptoms, which were reported more than 10 times, and 14 common factors were obtained. Symptoms with load coefficient over 0.3 were clustered and 6 syndromes were obtained, including syndrome of epidemic virus closing lung, syndrome of pathogenic heat invading lung, syndrome of Qi and Yin deficiency, internal block and outward desertion, syndrome of cold dampness closing lung, and syndrome of dampness heat accumulating lung. The literatures included 25 syndromes, and the syndromes with constituent ratio over 5% were internal block and outward desertion (14.62%), syndrome of epidemic virus closing lung (13.68%), syndrome of dampness heat accumulating lung (12.74%), syndrome of Qi deficiency of lung (10.85%), spleen and syndrome of cold dampness closing lung (8.50%), syndrome of Qi and Yin deficiency (8.50%), syndrome of pathogenic heat invading lung (8.02%) and syndrome of dampness repressing defensive Qi of lung (5.66%). Eighty-seven symptoms whose cumulative frequency was 2 838 were referred, including greasy fur (5.25%), fever (4.83%), red tongue (4.37%), rapid pulse (3.74%) and fatigue (3.46%). According to the results above, the common syndromes and their symptoms of COVID-19 were: (1) syndrome of pathogenic heat invading lung: fever, cough, throat-drying, headache, all of the body distressed and constipation, etc.; (2) syndrome of cold dampness closing lung: aversion to cold, all of the body distressed, nausea and vomiting, abdominal distention and loose stool, etc.; (3) syndrome of dampness heat accumulating lung: cough, sticky phlegm, anorexia, thirst without desire to drink and constipation, etc.; (4) syndrome of epidemic virus closing lung: fever, cough, yellow phlegm, wheezing, suffocation and purple lips, etc.; (5) internal block and outward desertion: coma, feel fidgety, suffocation, sweating and feel cold and purple lips, etc.; (6) syndrome of Qi and Yin deficiency: dry cough, sweating, fatigue, thirsty, feverish feeling in palms and soles and loose stool, etc.; (7) syndrome of Qi deficiency of lung and spleen: cough, wheezing, sweating, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and loose stool, et al. CONCLUSIONS The common syndromes of COVID-19 were syndrome of pathogenic heat invading lung, syndrome of cold dampness closing lung, syndrome of dampness heat accumulating lung, syndrome of epidemic virus closing lung, internal block and outward desertion, syndrome of Qi and Yin deficiency and syndrome of Qi deficiency of lung and spleen.

We compared the clinical characteristics, inflammatory response, and outcomes between patients with and without microbiologically confirmed ICU-acquired pneumonia. DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING ICUs of a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS We prospectively collected 270 consecutive patients with ICU-acquired pneumonia. Patients were clustered according to positive or negative microbiologic results. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We compared the characteristics and outcomes between both groups. Negative microbiology was found in 82 patients (30%). Both groups had similar baseline severity scores. Patients with negative microbiology presented more frequently chronic renal failure (15 [18%] vs 11 [6%]; p=0.003), chronic heart disorders (35 [43%] vs 55 [29%]; p=0.044), less frequently previous intubation (44 [54%] vs 135 [72%]; p=0.006), more severe hypoxemia (PaO2/FIO2: 165±73 mm Hg vs 199±79 mm Hg; p=0.001), and shorter ICU stay before the onset of pneumonia (5±5 days vs 7±9 days; p=0.001) compared with patients with positive microbiology. The systemic inflammatory response was similar between both groups. Negative microbiology resulted in less changes of empiric treatment (33 [40%] vs 112 [60%]; p=0.005) and shorter total duration of antimicrobials (13±6 days vs 17±12 days; p=0.006) than positive microbiology. Following adjustment for potential confounders, patients with positive microbiology had higher hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio 2.96, 95% confidence interval 1.24-7.04, p=0.014) and lower 90-day survival (adjusted hazard ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.27-0.94, p=0.031), with a nonsignificant lower 28-day survival. CONCLUSIONS Although the possible influence of previous intubation in mortality of both groups is not completely discarded, negative microbiologic findings in clinically suspected ICU-acquired pneumonia are associated with less frequent previous intubation, shorter duration of antimicrobial treatment, and better survival. Future studies should corroborate the presence of pneumonia in patients with suspected ICU-acquired pneumonia and negative microbiology.","Giunta, Valeria; Ferrer, Miquel; Esperatti, Mariano; Ranzani, Otavio T; Saucedo, Lina Maria; Li Bassi, Gianluigi; Blasi, Francesco; Torres, Antoni",Critical care medicine,670,1

159924,159924,159924,Infectious Diseases and Tropical Cyclones in Southeast China.,22.123005,1.979965,2017,"BACKGROUND Focus group discussions typically involve face-to-face facilitation. There is growing interest in utilising digital technologies to facilitate aspects of focus group research. To date, no study in the pharmacy profession has comprehensively described and evaluated a fully virtual process to focus group research, from recruitment to reimbursement. OBJECTIVE(S) This study aims to describe an entirely online approach to: recruiting for and facilitating virtual focus group discussions, and reimbursement of participants within the pharmacy profession. Specifically, our objectives were to identify 1) the dropout rate, 2) the geographic diversity of focus group participants, and 3) the occurrence of technological issues. METHOD Traditional face-to-face focus group recruitment and facilitation methods were adapted, pre-tested, and conducted using online platforms for advertising, participant expressions of interest, participant consent, focus group facilitation, and participant reimbursement. Populations of interest included community pharmacists, specialty practice pharmacists, hospital pharmacists, and pharmacy assistants and technicians across Australia. RESULTS Of the 153 potential participants who either completed an expression of interest to participate (135/153) or agreed to participate after direct contact (18/153), 59 confirmed that they would attend the focus group discussion (39%); 49 of the 59 (dropout rate: 17%) participated in one of eight focus groups. Collectively, there was representation from all States and Territories in Australia, as well as representation in each of the populations of interest. Three of 49 participants (6%) experienced minor technological issues during the process; no participant encountered major technological issues that precluded successful participation. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that an entirely online approach to focus group methodology is possible, has the potential to recruit demographically and geographically-diverse participants with low dropout rates, and can be successfully conducted with minimal technological issues. Despite the recent COVID-19 pandemic making physical focus group facilitation untenable, this fully-online approach enables research to be completed uninterrupted.","Halliday, Matthew; Mill, Deanna; Johnson, Jacinta; Lee, Kenneth",Research in social & administrative pharmacy : RSAP,670,25

Secondarily, to evaluate hospital policies regarding maternal COVID-19 screening and related to those infants born to mothers under investigation or confirmed to have COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: Serial cross-sectional surveys of MEDNAX-affiliated NICUs from March 26 to April 3, April 8 to April 19, May 4 to May 22, and July 13 to August 2, 2020. The surveys included questions regarding COVID-19 patient burden and policies regarding infant separation, feeding practices, and universal maternal screening. RESULTS: Among 386 MEDNAX-affiliated NICUs, responses were received from 153 (42%), 160 (44%), 165 (45%), 148 (38%) across four rounds representing an active patient census of 3,465, 3,486, 3,452, and 3,442 NICU admitted patients on the day of survey completion. Confirmed COVID-19 disease in NICU admitted infants was rare, with the prevalence rising from 0.03 (1 patient) to 0.44% (15 patients) across the four survey rounds, while the prevalence of patients under investigation increased from 0.8 to 2.6%. Hospitals isolating infants from COVID-19-positive mothers fell from 46 to 20% between the second and fourth surveys, while centers permitting direct maternal breastfeeding increased 17 to 47% over the same period. Centers reporting universal severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening for all expectant mothers increased from 52 to 69%. CONCLUSION: Among a large cohort of NICU infants, the prevalence of infants under investigation or with confirmed neonatal COVID-19 disease was low. Policies regarding universal maternal screening for SARS-CoV-2, infant isolation from positive mothers, and direct maternal breastfeeding for infants born to positive mothers are rapidly evolving. As universal maternal screening for SARS-CoV-2 becomes more common, the impact of these policies requires further investigation.

Little is understood about its effects during pregnancy. AIMS: To describe the current understanding of COVID-19 illness in pregnant women, to describe obstetric outcomes and to identify gaps in the existing knowledge. METHODS: Medline Ovid, EMBASE, World Health Organization COVID-19 research database and Cochrane COVID-19 in pregnancy spreadsheet were accessed on 18/4, 18/5 and 23/5 2020. Articles were screened via Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The following were excluded: reviews, opinion pieces, guidelines, articles pertaining solely to other viruses, single case reports. RESULTS: Sixty articles were included in this review. Some pregnant participants may have been included in multiple publications, as admission dates overlap for reports from the same hospital. However, a total of 1287 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant cases are reported. Where universal testing was undertaken, asymptomatic infection occurred in 43.5-92% of cases. In the cohort studies, severe and critical COVID-19 illness rates approximated those of the non-pregnant population. Eight maternal deaths, six neonatal deaths, seven stillbirths and five miscarriages were reported. Nineteen neonates were SARS-CoV-2 positive, confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swabs. [Correction added on 2 September 2020, after first online publication: the number of neonates indicated in the preceding sentence has been corrected from 'Thirteen' to 'Nineteen'.] CONCLUSIONS: Where universal screening was conducted, SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy was often asymptomatic. Severe and critical disease rates approximate those in the general population. Vertical transmission is possible; however, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 positive neonates were infected in utero, intrapartum or postpartum.

In the present multi-center study, we aimed to assess the differences underlying this association, and ascertain whether ethnicity also mediates other aspects of COVID-19 like cardiovascular complications. METHODS: Data were collected from a mixed-ethnicity UK cohort of 613 patients admitted and diagnosed COVID-19 positive, across six hospitals in London during the second half of March 2020: 292 were White Caucasian ethnicity, 203 were Asian and 118 were of Afro-Caribbean ethnicity. RESULTS: Caucasian patients were older (P<0.001) and less likely to have hypertension (P=0.038), while Afro-Caribbean patients had higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (P<0.001). Asian patients were more likely to present with venous thromboembolic disease (adj.OR=4.10, 95% CI 1.49-11.27, P=0.006). On the other hand, Afro-Caribbean had more heart failure (adj.OR=3.64, 95% CI 1.50-8.84, P=0.004) and myocardial injury (adj.OR=2.64, 95% CI 1.10-6.35, P=0.030). Importantly, our adjusted multi-variate Cox regression analysis revealed significantly higher all-cause mortality both for Asian (adj.HR=1.89, 95% CI 1.23-2.91, P=0.004) and Afro-Caribbean ethnicity (adj.HR=2.09, 95% CI 1.30-3.37, P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that COVID-19 may have different presentations and follow different clinical trajectories depending on the ethnicity of the affected subject. Awareness of complications more likely to arise in specific ethnicities will allow a more timely diagnosis and preventive measures for patients at risk. Due to increased mortality, individuals of Afro-Caribbean and Asian ethnicity should be considered as high-risk groups. This may have an impact on health-resource allocation and planning, definition of vulnerable groups, disease management, and the protection of healthcare workers at the frontline.","Papageorgiou, Nikolaos; Providencia, Rui; Saberwal, Bunny; Sohrabi, Catrin; Tyrlis, Angelos; Atieh, Abed Elfattah; Lim, Wei-Yao; Creta, Antonio; Khanji, Mohammed; Rusinova, Reni; Chooneea, Bashistraj; Khiani, Raj; Wijesuriya, Nadeev; Chow, Anna; Butt, Haroun; Browne, Stefan; Joshi, Nikhil; Kay, Jamie; Ahsan, Syed",Am J Cardiovasc Dis,670,30

Given this, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to concern about how stress due to the pandemic will affect children's development and mental health. Although early life stress has been linked to altered functioning of a number of neural and biological systems, there is a wide range of variability in children's outcomes. The mechanisms that influence these individual differences are still not well understood. In the past, studies of stress in childhood focused on the type of events that children encountered in their lives. We conducted a review of the literature to formulate a new perspective on the effects of early life stress on development. This new, topological model, may increase understanding of the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's development. This model is oriented on children's perceptions of their environment and their social relationships, rather than specific events. These factors influence central and peripheral nervous system development, changing how children interpret, adapt, and respond to potentially stressful events, with implications for children's mental and physical health outcomes.","Smith, Karen E; Pollak, Seth D",Cognitive affect. behav. neurosci.

This study aimed to identify the magnitude, characteristics and underlying motivations of ED visitors with delayed healthcare seeking behaviour during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: Between March 9 and July 92,020, adults visiting the ED of an academic hospital in the East of the Netherlands received an online questionnaire to collect self-reported data on delay in seeking emergency care and subsequent motivations for this delay. Telephone interviews were held with a subsample of respondents to better understand the motivations for delay as described in the questionnaire. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were thematically analysed. RESULTS: One thousand three hundred thirty-eight questionnaires were returned (34.0% response). One in five respondents reported a delay in seeking emergency care. Almost half of these respondents (n = 126; 45.4%) reported that the pandemic influenced the delay. Respondents reporting delay were mainly older adults (mean 61.6; ±13.1 years), referred to the ED by the general practitioner (GP; 35.1%) or a medical specialist (34.7%), visiting the ED with cardiac problems (39.7%). The estimated median time of delay in receiving ED care was 3 days (inter quartile range 8 days). Respectively 46 (16.5%) and 26 (9.4%) respondents reported that their complaints would be either less severe or preventable if they had sought for emergency care earlier. Delayed care seeking behaviour was frequently motivated by: fear of contamination, not wanting to burden professionals, perceiving own complaints less urgent relative to COVID-19 patients, limited access to services, and by stay home instructions from referring professionals. CONCLUSIONS: A relatively large proportion of ED visitors reported delay in seeking emergency care during the first wave. Delay was often driven by misperceptions of the accessibility of services and the legitimacy for seeking emergency care. Public messaging and close collaboration between the ED and referring professionals could help reduce delayed care for acute needs during future COVID-19 infection waves.","Nab, Maaike; van Vehmendahl, Robyn; Somers, Inne; Schoon, Yvonne; Hesselink, Gijs",BMC Emerg Med,670,16

A database search of literature published between December 1, 2019, and November 20, 2020, was performed per PRISMA guidelines. Twelve studies comprising 517 hospitalized LTx recipients with COVID-19 were analyzed. Common presenting symptoms were fever (71%), cough (62%), dyspnea (48%), and diarrhea (28%). Approximately 77% (95% CI, 61%-93%) of LTx recipients had a history of liver cirrhosis. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (55%), diabetes (45%), and cardiac disease (21%). In-hospital mortality was 20% (95% CI, 13%-28%) and rose to 41% (95% CI, 19%-63%) (P < 0.00) with ICU admission. Additional subgroup analysis demonstrated a higher mortality risk in the elderly (>60-65 years) (OR 4.26; 95% CI, 2.14-8.49). There was no correlation in respect to sex or time since transplant. In summary, LTx recipients with COVID-19 had a high prevalence of dyspnea and gastrointestinal symptoms. In-hospital mortality was comparable to non-transplant populations with similar comorbidities but appeared to be less than what is reported elsewhere for cirrhotic patients (26%-40%). Importantly, the observed high case fatality in the elderly could be due to age-associated comorbidities.","Jayant, Kumar; Reccia, Isabella; Virdis, Francesco; Pyda, Jordan S; Bachul, Piotr J; di Sabato, Diego; Barth, Rolf N; Fung, John; Baker, Talia; Witkowski, Piotr",Clin Transplant,670,16

The number of physician visits in the past 3 months and hospitalization in the preceding 12 months were used as outcome measures. Drawing on the Andersen model of health care use as a conceptual framework, predisposing characteristics, enabling resources and need factors as well as psychosocial variables were included as correlates. RESULTS: Negative binomial regressions showed that increased physician visits were associated with being female (IRR: 4.02 [95% CI: 1.60-10.11]), absence of chronic alcohol consume (IRR: 0.26 [95% CI: 0.12-0.57]) and lower health-related quality of life (IRR: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.96-0.98]).

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was done in HCWs belonging to various occupational roles and socio-cultural backgrounds across India through online platforms and telephonic interviews from July 30, 2020 to August 30, 2020. A scientifically designed and pre-validated questionnaire with good validity (CVR = 0.87, S-CVI/Av = 0.978) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.85) was used. RESULTS: The responses of 956 participants were analysed.

As this is a new emerging chaotic situation, already existing drugs have been suggested to ameliorate the infection of SARS-CoV-2. The consumption of caffeine has been suggested primarily because it improves exercise performance, reduces fatigue, and increases wakefulness and awareness. Caffeine has been proven to be an effective anti-inflammatory and immunomodulator. In airway smooth muscle, it has bronchodilator effects mainly due to its activity as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and adenosine receptor antagonist. In addition, a recent published document has suggested the potential antiviral activity of this drug using in silico molecular dynamics and molecular docking; in this regard, caffeine might block the viral entrance into host cells by inhibiting the formation of a receptor-binding domain and the angiotensin-converting enzyme complex and, additionally, might reduce viral replication by the inhibition of the activity of 3-chymotrypsin-like proteases.

Acute stroke patients continue to present to the emergency department and they may not have the usual symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Stroke team response and management must be done within the shortest possible time to minimize worsening of the functional outcome without compromising safety of the medical team. METHODS: Infection control recommendations, emergency department protocols and stroke response pathways utilized prior to the COVID 19 pandemic within our institution were evaluated by our stroke team in collaboration with the multidisciplinary healthcare services. Challenges during the COVID-19 scenario were identified, from which a revised acute stroke care algorithm was formulated to adapt to this pandemic. RESULTS: We formulated an algorithm that incorporates practices from internationally devised protocols while tailoring certain aspects to suit the available resources in our system locally. We highlighted the significance of the following: team role designation, coordination among different subspecialties and departments, proper use of personal protective equipment and resources, and telemedicine use during this pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This pandemic has shaped the stroke team's approach in the management of acute stroke patients. Our algorithm ensures proper resource management while optimizing acute stroke care during the COVID-19 pandemic in our local setting. This algorithm may be utilized and adapted for local practice and other third world countries who face similar constraints.","Co, Christian Oliver C; Yu, Jeryl Ritzi T; Macrohon-Valdez, Ma Cristina; Laxamana, Lina C; De Guzman, Vincent Paul E; Berroya-Moreno, Remy Margarette M; Mariano, Manuel M; Rivera, Peter Paul Dela Paz; Racpan-Cauntay, Joana Lyn M; Ilano, Karen Czarina S; Trias, Evita C; Domingo, Alyssa Mae C; Marcelo, Alvin Valeriano De Borja; Pineda-Franks, Maria Carissa C",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,670,32

There is no effective treatment against this disease. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) catalyzes the replication of RNA from RNA and the main protease (Mpro) has a role in the processing of polyproteins that are translated from the RNA of SARS-CoV-2, and thus these two enzymes are strong candidates for targeting by anti-viral drugs. Small molecules such as lopinavir and favipiravir significantly inhibit the activity of Mpro and RdRp in vitro. Studies have shown that structurally modified lopinavir, favipiravir, and other similar compounds can inhibit COVID-19 main protease (Mpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In this study, lopinavir and its structurally similar compounds were chosen to bind the main protease, and favipiravir was chosen to target RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Molecular docking and the quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) study revealed that the selected candidates have favorable binding affinity but less druggable properties. To improve the druggability, four structural analogues of lopinavir and one structural analogue of favipiravir was designed by structural modification. Molecular interaction analyses have displayed that lopinavir and favipiravir analogues interact with the active site residues of Mpro and RdRp, respectively. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) properties, medicinal chemistry profile, and physicochemical features were shown that all structurally modified analogues are less toxic and contain high druggable properties than the selected candidates. Subsequently, 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation of the top four docked complexes demonstrated that CID44271905, a lopinavir analogue, forms the most stable complex with the Mpro. Further MMPBSA analyses using the MD trajectories also confirmed the higher binding affinity of CID44271905 towards Mpro. In summary, this study demonstrates a new way to identify leads for novel anti-viral drugs against COVID-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The present study developed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) to complement the clinical efforts in preventing the spread and treating of COVID-19 cases. Methods: The sample comprised 717 Iranian participants. The items of the FCV-19S were constructed based on extensive review of existing scales on fears, expert evaluations, and participant interviews. Several psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain its reliability and validity properties. Results: After panel review and corrected item-total correlation testing, seven items with acceptable corrected item-total correlation (0.47 to 0.56) were retained and further confirmed by significant and strong factor loadings (0.66 to 0.74). Also, other properties evaluated using both classical test theory and Rasch model were satisfactory on the seven-item scale. More specifically, reliability values such as internal consistency (&#945; = .82) and test-retest reliability (ICC = .72) were acceptable. Concurrent validity was supported by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (with depression, r = 0.425 and anxiety, r = 0.511) and the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (with perceived infectability, r = 0.483 and germ aversion, r = 0.459). Conclusion: The Fear of COVID-19 Scale, a seven-item scale, has robust psychometric properties. It is reliable and valid in assessing fear of COVID-19 among the general population and will also be useful in allaying COVID-19 fears among individuals.","Ahorsu, Daniel Kwasi; Lin, Chung-Ying; Imani, Vida; Saffari, Mohsen; Griffiths, Mark D; Pakpour, Amir H",Int J Ment Health Addict,670,16

METHODS: Observational multicenter cohort study of 3,108 COVID-19 patients admitted to two hospitals in Madrid between March 1st and May 15th, 2020. Ten patients suffered an ACS while being hospitalized for COVID 19 and were followed for three months. The ACS incidence in hospitalized patients during the same period of 2019 was also studied. RESULTS: The incidence of ACS in COVID-19 patients was 3.31 , significantly higher than in the 2019 period, 1.01  (p = 0.013). COVID-19 patients that suffered and ACS frequently had a severe infection, presented with STEMI (80%), and had multivessel disease (67%). Mortality rate (30%) and hospital readmissions at three months (20%) were very high. CONCLUSIONS: Severe COVID-19 patients develop ACS more frequently than expected.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using Korea's nationwide healthcare database, which contained all individuals who received a diagnostic test for COVID-19 (n=232,390) as of May 15, 2020. We classified our cohort by health insurance type into beneficiaries of the National Health Insurance (NHI) or Medicaid programs. Our study outcomes were infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19-related outcomes, a composite of all-cause death, intensive care unit admission, and mechanical ventilation use. We estimated age-, sex-, and Charlson comorbidity index score-adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of the 218,070 NHI and 14,320 Medicaid beneficiaries who received COVID-19 tests, 7,777 and 738 tested positive, respectively. The Medicaid beneficiaries were older (mean age, 57.5 vs. 47.8 years), more likely to be males (47.2 vs. 40.2%), and had a higher comorbidity burden (mean CCI, 2.0 vs. 1.7) than NHI beneficiaries. Compared to NHI beneficiaries, Medicaid beneficiaries had a 22% increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.38), but had no significantly elevated risk of COVID-19-related outcomes (aOR 1.10, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.57); the individual events of the composite outcome yielded similar findings. CONCLUSIONS: As socioeconomic factors, with health insurance as a proxy, could serve as determinants during the current pandemic, pre-emptive support is needed for high-risk groups to slow its spread.","Jeong, Han Eol; Lee, Jongseong; Shin, Hyun Joon; Shin, Ju-Young",Epidemiol Health,670,33

Together with depression and sleep difficulties, anxiety symptoms seem to be the most diffused clinical outcome. The current contribution aimed to examine attentional bias for virus-related stimuli in people varying in their degree of health anxiety (HA). Consistent with previous literature, it was hypothesized that higher HA would predict attentional bias, tested using a visual dot-probe task, to virus-related stimuli. Participants were 132 Italian individuals that participated in the study during the lockdown phase in Italy. Results indicated that the HA level predicts attentional bias toward virus-related objects. This relationship is double mediated by the belief of contagion and by the consequences of contagion as assessed through a recent questionnaire developed to measure the fear for COVID-19. These findings are discussed in the context of cognitive-behavioral conceptualizations of anxiety suggesting a risk for a loop effect.

In the current COVID-19 context among older adults in the community, the fear of COVID-19, anxiety symptoms, compassion, resilience, and the practice of protective behaviors are possibly related to each other in several ways. How these factors relate to each other would have important implications in managing the spread of the disease and its mental health consequences. To this end, we modeled their interrelationships using a structural equation model. Older adults (N = 421), aged 60 and above completed various questionnaires-COVID-19 Fear Inventory, Short form of the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory, COVID-19 Risky and Protective Behaviours, Resilience Appraisals Scale, and Compassion Scale during a COVID-19 lockdown. The relationships between these variables were assessed within a structural equation model. The findings showed that older adults who are more compassionate engage in protective behaviors more frequently. Additionally, frequent practice of protective behaviors and greater resilience predicted lower anxiety among older adults. Greater fear predicted higher anxiety levels but did not significantly influence an individual's engagement in protective behaviors. Mental health services are crucial in fostering resilience and supporting older adults psychologically. Social services are also necessary in maintaining and enhancing social support for older adults. Importantly, these findings suggest that public health communications could promote compassion and avoid using a fear-based approach to increase engagement in protective behaviors.","Lim, Xin Ying; Yap, Ai Che; Mahendran, Rathi; Yu, Junhong",Transl Behav Med,670,1

Seeing that military forces have been encountering similar challenges, we found it eminent to share the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) Northern Command's (NC) preliminary experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively summarized the actions that were taken by our team, focusing on 18 battalions at the Israeli NC. These actions included promoting a series of organizational changes in terms of social distancing and medical regulations as well as working to strengthen medical leadership through designated video meetings with medical commanders across our organization. Meetings included relevant clinical education, updates, and leadership building. These actions and others were aimed to increase our influence on the decision-making processes. While we conducted real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests for soldiers who were suspected to have COVID-19 (those presenting with compatible signs and symptoms after having been exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 patient), we were not able to screen healthy populations, nor did we have serum antibody serologic tests available during the study period. We reviewed the COVID-19 outbreak national data, obtained from Ministry of Health publishings and the IDF databases. Data were included from February 26th, 2020 (day 0, first COVID-19 patient in Israel) to April 19th, 2020 (day 53, about 1 month after most of the COVID-19 regulation were issued in the NC). RESULTS: The mean age of the battalion soldiers was 21.29 ± 4.06 (range 18-50), 81.34% male. Most restrictions were issued on day 18. On day 53, 98.85% of the personnel in the battalions were kept active and asymptomatic in their units.

They can be ""enhanced"" by physical activity (including exercise), which increases their integrity, efficiency and dynamic adaptation to stressors, in short ""mitochondrial fitness"". Mitochondrial fitness is closely associated with cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity. Given the importance of mitochondria in immune functions, it is thus not surprising that cardiorespiratory fitness is also an integral determinant of the antiviral host defense and vulnerability to infection. Here, we first briefly review the role of physical activity in viral infections. We then summarize mitochondrial functions that are relevant for the antiviral immune response with a particular focus on the current Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic and on innate immune function. Finally, the modulation of mitochondrial and cardiorespiratory fitness by physical activity, aging and the chronic diseases that represent the most common comorbidities of COVID-19 is discussed. We conclude that a high mitochondrial - and related cardiorespiratory - fitness should be considered as protective factors for viral infections, including COVID-19. This assumption is corroborated by reduced mitochondrial fitness in many established risk factors of COVID-19, like age, various chronic diseases or obesity. We argue for regular analysis of the cardiorespiratory fitness of COVID-19 patients and the promotion of physical activity - with all its associated health benefits - as preventive measures against viral infection.","Burtscher, Johannes; Burtscher, Martin; Millet, Grégoire P",Redox Biol,670,22

However, specific diagnostic or therapeutic algorithms for CAC have not been established. In the current study, we analyzed coagulation abnormalities with point-of-care testing (POCT) and their relation to hemostatic complications in patients suffering from COVID-19 induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Our hypothesis was that specific diagnostic patterns can be identified in patients with COVID-19 induced ARDS at risk of thromboembolic complications utilizing POCT. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective observational study. Longitudinal data from 247 rotational thromboelastometries (Rotem R) and 165 impedance aggregometries (Multiplate R) were analysed in 18 patients consecutively admitted to the ICU with a COVID-19 induced ARDS between March 12th to June 30th, 2020. RESULTS: Median age was 61 years (IQR: 51-69). Median PaO2/FiO2 on admission was 122 mmHg (IQR: 87-189), indicating moderate to severe ARDS. Any form of hemostatic complication occurred in 78 % of the patients with deep vein/arm thrombosis in 39 %, pulmonary embolism in 22 %, and major bleeding in 17 %. In Rotem R elevated A10 and maximum clot firmness (MCF) indicated higher clot strength. The delta between EXTEM A10 minus FIBTEM A10 (DELTAA10) &gt; 30 mm, depicting the sole platelet-part of clot firmness, was associated with a higher risk of thromboembolic events (OD: 3.7;95 %CI 1.3-10.3;p = 0.02). Multiplate R aggregometry showed hypoactive platelet function. There was no correlation between single Rotem R and Multiplate R parameters at intensive care unit (ICU) admission and thromboembolic or bleeding complications. CONCLUSIONS: Rotem R and Multiplate R results indicate hypercoagulability and hypoactive platelet dysfunction in COVID-19 induced ARDS but were all in all poorly related to hemostatic complications..","Herrmann, J.; Notz, Q.; Schlesinger, T.; Stumpner, J.; Kredel, M.; Sitter, M.; Schmid, B.; Kranke, P.; Schulze, H.; Meybohm, P.; Lotz, C.",Thrombosis Journal [Electronic Resource],670,24

For example, malicious viruses and rumors are spreading rapidly through online social network platforms over the Internet and diseases with high transmission power are rapidly spreading through human contact. Apart from these, some infections may occur individually regardless of the effect of the network such as computer failure. In the context of these infections coexisting, it is one of crucial problem to distinguish whether the infection with externally similar symptoms is caused by a cascade or by itself because if the infection is the cascade that is spreading through the network, it is necessary to stop this spread as soon as possible. In this paper, we study this classification problem to determine whether it is infected from a cascade or randomly when the infection snapshot is partially given. We propose two approaches for the problem (i) Neighbor-based approach as the use of local infection status information and (ii) Source-based approach as the global infection status information. The first one is that we just count the number of connected infection paths from L-hop distance to an infected node by using some criteria whereas, the second one is that we use the information of the location of cascade sources to infer the infection cause of each infected node by computing the infection probability from the sources. We perform various simulations to obtain the classification performance of the two proposed algorithms. As a result, the method of estimating a global cascade source shows better performance than that of the former one, which uses only the infection information of local neighboring nodes if the sampling rate of cascade infections is sufficient.

New, previously unstudied viruses and some specific mutant or recombinant variants of known viruses constantly appear. An example is a variant of coronaviruses (CoV) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), named SARS-CoV-2. Some antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir as well as antiretroviral drugs including darunavir, lopinavir, and ritonavir are suggested to be effective in treating disorders caused by SARS-CoV-2. There are data on the utilization of antiretroviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Since there are many studies aimed at the identification of the molecular mechanisms of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and the development of novel therapeutic approaches against HIV-1, we used HIV-1 for our case study to identify possible molecular pathways shared by SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1. We applied a text and data mining workflow and identified a list of 46 targets, which can be essential for the development of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1.

Studies based on in-hospital exposure have suggested a beneficial effect of these drugs, unlike those based on chronic exposure. We aimed to analyse RAAS blocker prescription before and during hospital stay in patients with COVID-19, and the corresponding outcomes, to explain these discrepant results. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study conducted in 347 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (Bichat Hospital, Paris, France, 23 January-29 April 2020), RAAS blocker exposure, as well as timing and reason for treatment modifications, were collected. The association between exposure and mortality within 30 days of hospital admission was analysed using logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities. RESULTS: Median age was 61 [interquartile range, 51-72] years, 209 (60%) were male, 169 (49%) had a history of treated hypertension, and 117 (34%) received a RAAS blocker prior to hospitalization. RAAS blockers were discontinued within the first 7 days of hospital admission in 33% of previously treated patients (mostly driven by severity of the disease), with a corresponding mortality rate of 33%. Mortality was 8% when treatment was maintained or introduced, and 12% in patients never exposed.

The three patients from Wuhan were infected by COVID-19 in January or February 2020, while the Wurzburg patients were diagnosed in March or April 2020. Due to COVID-19 infection, anti-MM treatment was discontinued in all the patients. Notably, two patients (Nos. 3-4) in Wurzburg showed no COVID-19 symptoms, and the other three patients (Nos. 1, 2, and 5) exhibited only mild symptoms such as fever, cough, and nausea, which did not require an intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Interestingly, approximately 3 weeks after diagnosis, as the patient No. 6 was discharged and the swab was also negative for COVID-19, both COVID-19 IgM and IgG were tested negative in this patient. In four patients from Wurzburg, we also performed COVID-19 antibody test after recovery, and three of them (Nos. 1, 2, and 5) showed positive IgG, while one patient (No. 3) did not develop IgG or IgM against COVID-19. This finding suggested inadequate humoral immune response in MM patients, probably due to secondary immune deficiency caused by the treatments or the disease itself. This observation suggested that it might be a nosocomial infection in this patient. After recovery, two patients from Wurzburg received MM therapy, i.e., lenalidomide maintenance in one patient and DARA-VRCD (daratumumab, bortezomib, lenalidomide, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone) in another patient with NDMM.","Zhou, Xiang Bai Tao Meckel K.; Song, Jun Jin Yu Kortum K.

In spite of the high sequence identity of SARS-CoV-2 with its closely related SARS-CoV emerged in 2002, the atomic-level determinants underlining the molecular recognition of SARS-CoV-2 to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and, thus, the rapid virus spread into human body, remain unresolved.

Chloroquine (CQ) and its analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were found to be efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 when investigated in preliminary in vitro experiments. Reports of success in early clinical studies were widely publicised by news outlets, politicians and on social media. These results led several countries to approve the use of these drugs for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Despite having reasonable safety profiles in the treatment of malaria and certain autoimmune conditions, both drugs are known to have potential cardiotoxic side effects. There is a high incidence of myocardial injury and arrhythmia reported with COVID-19 infection, and as such this population may be more susceptible to this side-effect profile. Studies to date have now demonstrated that in patients with COVID-19, these drugs are associated with significant QTc prolongation, as well as reports of ventricular arrhythmias. Furthermore, subsequent studies have failed to demonstrate clinical benefit from either drug. Indeed, clinical trials have also been stopped early due to safety concerns over HCQ.

While social scientists know a fair amount about compliance with these recommendations, we know less about why some people may have been more likely to comply than others. Building on insights from Human Values Theory, we argue that people who are more self-transcendent (i.e. more likely to put others' needs before their own) are more likely to engage in a variety of prosocial health behaviors (PSHB). In a demographically representative survey (N = 1,015) conducted at the pandemic's outset, we find that self-transcendent people were significantly more likely to engage in PSHB;irrespective of partisanship and local COVID-19 transmission rates. Recognizing the limitations of self-reported data, we validate these findings by merging international and interstate phone-tracking data into opinion surveys. We find that, on average, people in both countries and states that place a higher emphasis on self-transcendence values were more likely to engage in social distancing. Our work suggests that while prosocial health recommendations are politically contentious, variation in compliance transcends conventional partisan disagreements.

This review summarizes the history, past achievements, and future directions of the GeoSentinel Network. KEY FINDINGS: Funded by the US CDC in 1996, GeoSentinel has grown from a group of eight US-based travel and tropical medicine centers to a global network, which currently consists of 68 sites in 28 countries. GeoSentinel has provided important contributions that have enhanced the ability to use destination-specific differences to guide diagnosis and treatment of returning travelers, migrants, and refugees. During the last two decades, GeoSentinel has identified a number of sentinel infectious disease events including previously unrecognized outbreaks and occurrence of diseases in locations thought not to harbor certain infectious agents. GeoSentinel has also provided useful insight into illnesses affecting different traveling populations such as migrants, business travelers, and students, while characterizing in greater detail the epidemiology of infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, leishmaniasis, and Zika virus disease. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance of travel- and migration-related infectious diseases has been the main focus of GeoSentinel for the last 25 years. However, GeoSentinel is now evolving into a network that will conduct both research and surveillance. The large number of participating sites and excellent geographic coverage for identification of both common and illnesses in individuals who have traversed international borders uniquely position GeoSentinel to make important contributions of travel-related infectious diseases in the years to come.","Hamer, Davidson H; Rizwan, Aisha; Freedman, David O; Kozarsky, Phyllis; Libman, Michael",J. travel med,670,16

This study aims to examine how fact-checking habit influences COVID-19 knowledge in the COVID-19 infodemic. STUDY DESIGN: This study uses a cross-sectional survey. METHODS: During the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China, we conducted an online survey and collected data from 3000 representative Chinese Internet users. The study measured COVID-19 knowledge as a dependent variable, fact-checking habit as an independent variable, and general science knowledge and negative emotion as moderators. Internet use and several demographic factors were used as control variables. Ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between fact-checking habit and COVID-19 knowledge as a function of science knowledge and negative emotion. RESULTS: Fact-checking habit was negatively associated with COVID-19 knowledge, and the relationship was moderated by general science knowledge and negative emotion. For those with less science knowledge or higher levels of negative emotion, COVID-19 knowledge was lower with the increase of experience in fact-checking. CONCLUSIONS: During a pandemic, individuals may not be able to obtain high-quality information, even if they regularly fact-check information, and especially when they lack knowledge about science or are influenced by negative emotion. To promote health knowledge during a public health crisis, basic science literacy must be promoted, and the psychological impact of the crisis on the population must also be considered.","Yu, W; Shen, F",Public Health,670,21

Peru is especially susceptible to a range of environmental exposures, including high levels of pollutants, contamination associated with extractive industries, and flooding exacerbated by the ongoing climate emergency. International policies and movements are increasingly calling for a gendered approach to planetary health. However, little research has been done explicitly examining environmental threats to women's health in Peru. We aimed to understand the current Peruvian research, advocacy, and policy landscape at the environment-gender health nexus. Methods: We did in-depth semi-structured interviews in Spanish via online Zoom video conferencing (audio only) with key informants from the Peruvian Government, academia, and non-governmental organisations to explore their perception of environmental health threats and priorities, population vulnerability factors, awareness of projects and collaborations on these topics, and the role of gender in their work. We used thematic analysis to compare priorities, gender sensitivity, and barriers and facilitators to delivering successful women's environmental health projects in the country. Findings: Since July 14, 2020, we have interviewed 16 people, with four further interviews planned to take place before the end of May, 2021. Several interviewees mentioned the detrimental role of weak institutions, multilevel corruption, and the absence of interdisciplinarity and intersectorality across programmes and research. Barriers to successful collaboration across organisations and sectors were clearly identified, including funding scandals related to extractive economies, high staff turnovers impairing long-term programme implementation, and machismo culture in both organisations and communities. By contrast, some interviewees highlighted that successful collaborations were instead built on direct relationships, reputation, trust, and transparency. Women's empowerment was also described as important for successful programme delivery, especially in female-led associations. Some interviewees emphasised the so-called invisibilisation of vulnerable groups, such as girls, teenagers, pregnant women, victims of gender-based violence, and LGBTQI people. Existing health inequalities varied by setting and cultural context and were deeply and silently exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Interpretation: These qualitative findings highlight the multiple and inter-related contextual issues faced by environmentally threatened communities in Peru, and how macrostructural barriers contribute to a paucity of sustainable, gender-oriented, environmental health projects.

There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether patients on systemic immunomodulators are at increased risk of developing COVID-19 disease or more likely to have severe disease. As such, clinicians need to assess the benefit-to-risk ratio on a case-by-case basis. In patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 disease, all immunomodulators used for skin diseases should be immediately withheld, with the possible exception of systemic corticosteroid therapy, which needs to be weaned. In patients who develop symptoms or signs of an upper respiratory tract infection, but COVID-19 is not yet confirmed, consider dose reduction or temporarily cessation for 1-2 weeks. In otherwise well patients, immunomodulators and biologics should be continued.

Vaccinating children against COVID-19 would contribute to the control of the pandemic and the recovery of the global economy. For children under the age of 18 years, parents are usually the decision makers regarding their children's vaccination. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate parental acceptability of free COVID-19 vaccination for children under the age of 18 years in China. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional, closed online survey among 2053 factory workers in Shenzhen, China, implemented from September 1 to 7, 2020. Participants of the online survey were full-time employees aged 18 years or over who had resumed work in factories in Shenzhen. Factory workers in Shenzhen are required to receive physical examinations once a year. Eligible workers attending six designated physical examination sites were invited to complete an online survey. This study was based on a subsample of those who had at least one child under the age of 18 years (N=1052). After being briefed that COVID-19 vaccines developed by China are likely to be available by the end of 2020, participants were asked about their likelihood of having their children under the age of 18 years take up free COVID-19 vaccination provided by the government, if it existed. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to examine the associations of perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and exposure to information related to COVID-19 through social media with parental acceptability, after controlling for significant background characteristics. RESULTS: The prevalence of parents' acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children was 72.6% (764/1052). After adjusting for significant background characteristics, positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.70, 95% CI 1.50-1.91), the perception that a family member would support them in having their children take up COVID-19 vaccination (ie, perceived subjective norm) (AOR 4.18, 95% CI 3.21-5.43), and perceived behavioral control to have the children take up COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.49-2.26) were associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. Regarding social media influence, higher exposure to positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination was associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.17-1.56). Higher exposure to negative information related to COVID-19 vaccination was negatively associated with the dependent variable (AOR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Parents' acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children under 18 years of age was high in China. The TPB is a useful framework to guide the development of future campaigns promoting COVID-19 vaccination targeting parents. Transparency in communicating about the vaccine development process and vaccine safety testing is important. Public health authorities should also address misinformation in a timely manner.","Zhang, Ke Chun; Fang, Yuan; Cao, He; Chen, Hongbiao; Hu, Tian; Chen, Ya Qi; Zhou, Xiaofeng; Wang, Zixin",JMIR Pediatr Parent,670,29

Helminths display potent immunomodulatory activity by activating T helper type 2 (Th2) anti-inflammatory and Th3 regulatory immune responses. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can exacerbate Th1/Th17 pro-inflammatory cytokine production in humans, leading to a cytokine storm. Air pollutants (particulate matter, oxygen radicals, hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds) and water pollutants (metals and organic chemicals) can also intensify Th1/Th17 immune response and could exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 related respiratory distress and failure. The present review focused on the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, helminths and fine particulate matter 2.5 µm or less in diameter (PM2.5) air pollution exposure in helminth endemic regions, the possible immunomodulatory activity of helminths against SARS-CoV-2 hyper-inflammatory immune response, and whether air and water pollutants can further exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 related cytokine storm and in the process hinder helminths immunomodulatory functionality. Helminth Th2/Th3 immune response is associated with reductions in lung inflammation and damage, and decreased expression levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors (SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptors to infect cells and associated with extensive lung damage). However, air pollutants are associated with overexpression of ACE2 receptors in the epithelial cell surface of the respiratory tract and exhaustion of Th2 immune response. Helminth-induced immunosuppression activity reduces vaccination efficacy, and diminishes vital Th1 cytokine production immune responses that are crucial for combating early stage infections. This could be reversed by continuous air pollution exposure which is known to intensify Th1 pro-inflammatory cytokine production to a point where the immunosuppressive activities of helminths could be hindered. Again, suppressed activities of helminths can also be disadvantageous against SARS-CoV-2 inflammatory response. This ""yin and yang"" approach seems complex and requires more understanding. Further studies are warranted in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals residing in helminths and air pollution endemic regions to offer more insights, and to impact mass periodic deworming programmes and environmental health policies.","Naidoo, Pragalathan; Ghazi, Terisha; Chuturgoon, Anil A; Naidoo, Rajen N; Ramsuran, Veron; Mpaka-Mbatha, Miranda N; Bhengu, Khethiwe N; Nembe, Nomzamo; Duma, Zamathombeni; Pillay, Roxanne; Singh, Ravesh; Mkhize-Kwitshana, Zilungile L",Environ Int,670,20

Summary Background Data: Acute appendicitis is the most commonly performed emergency surgery in the United States and is unlikely to improve without medical or surgical intervention. Dramatic reductions in ED visits prompted concern that individuals with serious conditions, such as acute appendicitis, were deferring treatment for fear of contracting COVID-19. Methods: Patients from 146 hospitals with diagnosed appendicitis and arrival between March 2016 and May 2020 were selected. Electronic medical records data were retrospectively reviewed to retrieve patient data. Daily admissions were averaged from March 2016 through May 2019 and compared with March 2020. April-specific admissions were compared across the 5-year pre-COVID-19 period to April 2020 to identify differences in volume, demographics, disease severity, and outcomes. Results: Appendicitis patient admissions in 2020 decreased throughout March into April, with April experiencing the fewest admissions. April 2020 experienced a substantial decrease in patients who presented with appendicitis, dropping 25.4%, from an average of 2030 patients (2016-2019) to 1516 in 2020. An even greater decrease of 33.8% was observed in pediatric patients (age &lt;18). Overall, 77% of the 146 hospitals experienced a reduction in appendicitis admissions. There were no differences between years in percent of patients treated nonoperatively (P = 0.493) incidence of shock (P = 0.95), mortality (P = 0.24), or need for postoperative procedures (P = 0.81). Conclusions: Acute appendicitis presentations decreased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, while overall management and patient outcomes did not differ from previous years. Further research is needed focusing on putative explanations for decreased hospital presentations unrelated to COVID-19 infection and possible implications for surgical management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

The recent novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged during December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has repeatedly raised questions about its characteristic variability. Despite belonging to the same family, SARS-CoV-2 has proven to be quite difficult to control and contain in terms of transmissibility, leading to around 19.8 million reported cases and more than 730,000 deaths of individuals worldwide. Here, we discuss how SARS-CoV-2 differs from its two other related human coronaviruses in terms of genome composition, site of infection, and transmissibility, among several other notable aspects-all indicating to the possibility that it is these variations in addition to other unknowns that are contributing to this virus' differing deadly pattern.","Araf, Yusha; Faruqui, Nairita Ahsan; Anwar, Saeed; Hosen, Mohammad Jakir",Int. microbiol,670,1

Moreover, it is not exclusive to older people. Delirium is not inevitable; rather, it is preventable. Delirium prevention programs are even more crucial in the era of COVID-19 and cannot be allowed to wither despite the challenges of integrating delirium prevention with COVID-19 care.

Elevated levels of blood IL-6 had been identified as a one of the risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 disease. Anti-IL6 inhibitors are among the therapeutic armamentarium for preventing the fatal consequences of acute respiratory and multi organ failure in around 20% of the COVID-19 infected patients. At present, their use is prioritized to patients with severe interstitial pneumonia (Brescia-COVID Scale-COVID 2-3) with hyperinflammation as determined by the presence of elevated IL6 and/or d-dimer, or progressive d-dimer increase, in patients who otherwise are subsidiary to ICU admission. However, many uncertainties remain on the actual role of anti-IL6 inhibitors in this setting, and whether current use and timing is the right one. There is the hypothesis that the use of anti-IL6 inhibitors at an earlier state during the hyperinflammatory syndrome would be beneficial and may avoid progressing to ARDS. On the other hand, the standard of care has changed and nowadays the use of corticosteroids has become part of the SOC in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. Our limited experience suggests that better treatment outcomes can be achieved when combining IL6-inhibitors (e.g. sarilumab) with corticosteroids. The aim of the present study is to evaluate if an earlier therapeutic intervention with sarilumab plus SOC (including corticosteroids) may be more effective than current standard of care alone, in preventing progression to respiratory failure in COVID-19 infected patients with interstitial pneumonia. This study will also provide supportive evidence to that provided by currently ongoing studies on the efficacy and safety of sarilumab in this clinical context. TRIAL DESIGN: A phase two multi-center randomised controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel arms (1:1 ratio). PARTICIPANTS: They will be hospitalized patients, of at least 18 years of age, with severe COVID-19 who have positive RT-PCR test and have radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates by imaging or rales/crackles on exam and SpO2 &#8804; 94% on room air that requires supplemental oxygen. Patients must present elevation of inflammatory parameters (IL-6 > 40 pg/mL or d-dimer >1.0 mcg/ml) or, alternatively, progressive worsening in at least two of these inflammatory parameters in the prior 24-48h: CRP, LDH, serum ferritin, lymphopenia, or d-dimer. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: high oxygen requirements (including face mask with reservoir, non-invasive mechanical ventilation or high flow nasal cannula, or mechanical ventilation), admission to ICU, pregnancy or lactation, allergy or hypersensitivity to sarilumab or corticoesteroids, immunosuppressive antibody therapy within the past 5 months, AST/ALT values > 10 x ULN, neutropenia (< 0.5 x 109/L), severe thrombocytopenia (< 50 x 109/L), sepsis caused by an alternative pathogen, diverticulitis with risk of perforation or ongoing infectious dermatitis. The study will be conducted in several hospitals in Spain. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients randomised to the experimental arm will receive sarilumab + methylprednisolone plus SOC for COVID-19. Patients included in the control arm will receive methylprednisolone plus SOC for COVID-19. Corticosteroids will be given to all patients at a 1mg/kg/d of methylprednisolone for at least 3 days. Clinical follow-up visits will be performed at 3, 5, and 15 days after treatment randomization. Patients in the control group (SOC group without sarilumab) progressing to Brescia- COVID 2-3 plus inflammatory markers, will be given the option to be rescued with sarilumab at the same doses and, in that case, be included in an open-label phase and be followed up for additional weeks (with visits at 3, 7 and 15 days after sarilumab rescue administration). Patients randomly assigned to sarilumab therapy at baseline progressing to Brescia-COVID 2-3 will be rescued according to local clinical practice protocols. A final follow-up visit will be conducted for all patients at day 29 from randomization, regardless of initial treatment assignment. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary end point is the proportion of patients progressing to either severe respiratory failure (Brescia-COVID &#8805;2), ICU admission, or death. RANDOMIZATION: Randomization codes were produced by means of the PROC PLAN of the SAS system, with a 1:1 assignment ratio, stratifying by centre and using blocks multiple of 2 elements. The randomization schedule will be managed through the eCRF in a concealed manner. BLINDING (MASKING): All study drugs will be administered as open label. No blinding methods will be used in this trial. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SIMPLE SIZE): The target sample size will be 200 COVID-19 patients, who will be allocated randomly to control arm (100) and treatment arm (100).

SARS­CoV­2 is a novel CoV originating from ß­CoVs. Major distinctions in the gene sequences between SARS­CoV and SARS­CoV­2 include the spike gene, open reading frame (ORF) 3b and ORF 8. SARS­CoV­2 infection is initiated when the virus interacts with angiotensin­converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on host cells. Through this mechanism, the virus infects the alveolar, esophageal epithelial, ileum, colon and other cells on which ACE2 is highly expressed, causing damage to target organs. To date, host innate immunity may be the only identified direct factor associated with viral replication. However, increased ACE2 expression may upregulate the viral load indirectly by increasing the baseline level of infectious virus particles. The peak viral load of SARS­CoV­2 is estimated to occur ~10 days following fever onset, causing patients in the acute stage to be the primary infection source. However, patients in the recovery stage or with occult infections can also be contagious. The host immune response in patients with COVID­19 remains to be elucidated. By studying other SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, it is hypothesized that patients with COVID­19 may lack sufficient antiviral T­cell responses, which consequently present with innate immune response disorders. This may to a certain degree explain why this type of CoV triggers severe inflammatory responses and immune damage and its associated complications.","Shang, Jin; Du, Lingyao; Han, Ning; Lv, Duoduo; Wang, Jiayi; Yang, Hailing; Bai, Lang; Tang, Hong",Mol Med Rep,670,18

Then the positive clones were sequenced and reconstituted into whole human IgG for epitope binning assays. After that, all 19 IgG were classified into 6 different epitope groups or Bins. Although all these antibodies were shown to have ability to bind RBD, the antibodies in Bin2 have more superiority to inhibit the interaction between spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2). Most importantly, the antibodies from Bin2 can also strongly bind with mutant RBDs (W463R, R408I, N354D, V367F and N354D/D364Y) derived from SARS-CoV-2 strain with increased infectivity, suggesting the great potential of these antibodies in preventing infection of SARS-CoV-2 and its mutations. Furthermore, these neutralizing antibodies strongly restrict the binding of RBD to hACE2 overexpressed 293T cells. Consistently, these antibodies effectively neutralized pseudovirus entry into hACE2 overexpressed 293T cells. In Vero-E6 cells, these antibodies can even block the entry of live SARS-CoV-2 into cells at only 12.5 nM. These results suggest that these neutralizing human antibodies from the patient-derived antibody libraries have the potential to become therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants in this global pandemic.","Lou, Yan; Zhao, Wenxiang; Wei, Haitao; Chu, Min; Chao, Ruihua; Yao, Hangping; Su, Junwei; Li, Yanan; Li, Xiulan; Cao, Yu; Feng, Yanyan; Wang, Ping; Xia, Yongyang; Shang, Yushuan; Li, Fengping; Ge, Pingju; Zhang, Xinglin; Gao, Wenjing; Du, Bing; Liang, Tingbo; Qiu, Yunqing; Liu, Minyao",bioRxiv,670,30

The presence of patent foramen ovale and high pressure of the right heart caused the clots to enter the heart's left side. He received fibrinolytics, and his condition improved with no need for surgery. Hence, patients with impending paradoxical embolism may take advantage of medical treatment, such as fibrinolytics.

However, a massive waste in research was noticed during pandemic, preventing the scientists to produce totally novel and original results, and the citizenship to have the complete support they needed from science. The present work investigated the relationship between planned funding, research grants, scientific publications and epidemiology in the 27 EU countries, retrieving a significant correlation between scientific publications and COVID-19 cases and deaths, as well as with economic data. Interestingly, planned coronavirus-devoted funds were correlated with lower GDP per capita and higher mortality, leading to the hypothesis for a lack of translation into real funds allowed to the respective country, or for a significant research waste, not transformed into a tangible product or effect. Such results could suggest the need for a different approach in the future concerning the redistribution of research funds in case of COVID-19 relapse or future pandemic events.","Tonacci, Alessandro; Genovese, Sara; Pioggia, Giovanni; Gangemi, Sebastiano",Clin Mol Allergy,670,1

To better define the epidemiology of EV-D68, 6,800 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 2010–2014 were subject to EV-D68 detection by RT-PCR and sequencing of 5′UTR and partial VP1. EV-D68 was detected in 30 (0.44%) NPAs from 22 children and 8 adults/elderlies. Sixteen patients (including five elderly) (53%) had pneumonia and 13 (43%) patients were complicated by small airway disease exacerbation. Phylogenetic analysis of VP1, 2C and 3D regions showed four distinct lineages of EV-D68, clade A1, A2, B1 and B3, with adults/elderlies exclusively infected by clade A2. The potentially new clade, B3, has emerged in 2014, while strains closely related to recently emerged B1 strains in the United States were also detected as early as 2011 in Hong Kong. The four lineages possessed distinct aa sequence patterns in BC and DE loops. Amino acid residues 97 and 140, within BC and DE-surface loops of VP1 respectively, were under potential positive selection. EV-D68 infections in Hong Kong usually peak in spring/summer, though with a delayed autumn/winter peak in 2011. This report suggests that EV-D68 may cause severe respiratory illness in adults/elderlies with underlying co-morbidities.","Lau, Susanna K. P.; Yip, Cyril C.

Overall, we find that scientists perceive immunity certificates as favorable for public health (50.2%) and the state of the economy (54.4%) while one-fifth (19.1%) and one-sixth (15.4%) disagree. Scientists stipulate some concerns about fairness (36.5%) and inequality (22.4%) arising from implementation of immunity certification. We find some smaller differences among scientific fields, particularly between health scientists and social scientists, with the latter being slightly more positive about the effect of immunity certification. Scholars in the United States, including health scientists, are more likely to view the immunity certificates favorably and mention fewer concerns about this policy’s effect on fairness and inequality. Female scholars are significantly less in favor of immunity certificates, while scientists with more conservative political views hold more favorable opinions. Our results reveal that given the uncertainties during an early phase of a pandemic, scientists see scope for immunity certification to lessen the general societal impacts of the crisis.","Aranzales, Iván; Chan, Ho Fai; Eichenberger, Reiner; Hegselmann, Rainer; Stadelmann, David; Torgler, Benno",Sci Rep,670,20

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Observational epidemiological study of travellers in managed quarantine in Australia and New Zealand, to 15 June 2021. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of quarantine system failures, and failure with respect to numbers of travellers and SARS-CoV-2-positive travellers. RESULTS: We identified 22 quarantine system failures in Australia and ten in New Zealand to 15 June 2021. One failure initiated a COVID-19 outbreak that caused more than 800 deaths (the Victorian ""second wave""); nine lockdowns were linked with quarantine system failures. The failure risk was estimated to be 5.0 failures per 100 000 travellers passing through quarantine and 6.1 (95% CI, 4.0-8.3) failures per 1000 SARS-CoV-2-positive travellers. The risk per 1000 SARS-CoV-2-positive travellers was higher in New Zealand than Australia (relative risk, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.0-4.2). CONCLUSIONS: Quarantine system failures can be costly in terms of lives and economic impact, including lockdowns. Our findings indicate that infection control in quarantine systems in Australia and New Zealand should be improved, including vaccination of quarantine workers and incoming travellers, or that alternatives to hotel-based quarantine should be developed.","Grout, Leah; Katar, Ameera; Ait Ouakrim, Driss; Summers, Jennifer A; Kvalsvig, Amanda; Baker, Michael G; Blakely, Tony; Wilson, Nick",Med. j.

While numerous seroprevalence reports have been published by blood operators during the COVID‐19 pandemic, details on the assay used has not been well documented. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the diversity of assays being used by blood operators and assess how this may affect seroprevalence estimates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We surveyed 49 blood component providers from 39 countries. Questionnaire included information on the number and identity of assays used, the detected immunoglobulin(s) and target antigen, and performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity). RESULTS: Thirty‐eight of the 49 contacted blood suppliers provided at least partial responses. The results indicate that 19 commercial and five in‐house serology assays have been used by surveyed blood operators. The Abbott SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG assay was the most commonly used kit and utilized by 15 blood suppliers. Two assays did not detect IgG, but detected either IgM/IgA or IgM. 68·2% of assays targeted the spike protein and 50% the nucleocapsid protein, while 18·2% targeted both viral proteins. The sensitivity and specificity of IgG‐specific assays ranged from 71·9% to 100% and from 96·2% to 100%, respectively. As of 18 October 2020, the seroprevalence was below 5% in 10 of 14 countries reporting. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the diversity of assays being used. Analyses comparing blood donor seroprevalence across countries should consider assay characteristics with optimization of signal/cut‐off ratios and consistent methodology to adjust for waning antibody.","Lewin, Antoine; Drews, Steven J.; Lieshout‐Krikke, Ryanne; Erikstrup, Christian; Saeed, Sahar; Fady, Helen; Uzicanin, Samra; Custer, Brian; O’Brien, Sheila F",Vox Sang,670,24

There is currently no evidence to support the use of antiseizure medications as primary prevention against poststroke epilepsy. Perampanel has a unique antiglutamatergic mechanism of action and may have antiepileptogenic properties. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of perampanel as an antiepileptogenic treatment in patients at high risk of poststroke epilepsy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Up to 328 patients with cortical ischaemic stroke or lobar haemorrhage will be enrolled, and receive their first treatment within 7 days of stroke onset. Patients will be randomised (1:1) to receive perampanel (titrated to 6 mg daily over 4 weeks) or matching placebo, stratified by stroke subtype (ischaemic or haemorrhagic). Treatment will be continued for 12 weeks after titration. 7T MRI will be performed at baseline for quantification of cerebral glutamate by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and glutamate chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging. Blood will be collected for measurement of plasma glutamate levels. Participants will be followed up for 52 weeks after randomisation. The primary study outcome will be the proportion of participants in each group free of late (more than 7 days after stroke onset) poststroke seizures by the end of the 12-month study period, analysed by Fisher’s exact test. Secondary outcomes will include time to first seizure, time to treatment withdrawal and 3-month modified Rankin Scale score. Quality of life, cognitive function, mood and adverse events will be assessed by standardised questionnaires. Exploratory outcomes will include correlation between cerebral and plasma glutamate concentration and stroke and seizure outcomes.

Within months, additional cases were described, mostly in frontline troops, and the new disease was called trench fever. More than 1 million troops were infected with trench fever during World War 1, with each affected soldier unfit for duty for more than 60 days. Diagnosis was challenging, because there were no pathognomonic signs and symptoms and the causative organism could not be cultured. For 3 years, the transmission and cause of trench fever were hotly debated. In 1918, two commissions identified that the disease was louse-borne. The bacterium Rickettsia quintana was consistently found in the gut and faeces of lice that had fed on patients with trench fever and its causative role was accepted in the 1920s. The organism was cultured in the 1960s and reclassified as Bartonella quintana; it was also found to cause endocarditis, peliosis hepatis, and bacillary angiomatosis. Subsequently, B quintana infection has been identified in new populations in the Andes, in homeless people in urban areas, and in individuals with HIV. The story of trench fever shows how war can lead to the recrudescence of an infectious disease and how medicine approached an emerging infection a century ago.","Anstead, Gregory M",Lancet Infect Dis,670,14

EM is a difficult, quite expensive and long method, which requires technicians with a high qualification. Therefore, EM is currently rarely available at the hospital in a laboratory of pathology and is essentially established in research centers. However, EM is still an essential tool for the surgical pathologist. This method allows in some circumstances to confirm or, more rarely, to make the diagnosis of a couple of tissular and cellular lesions observed in human pathology. EM is also an interesting method to better understand the etiopathogenesis of emerging human diseases, in particular of emerging infectious diseases.

In this process, the collision of fundamental rights emerges as a crucial challenge for decision-making. Policy Options and Implications: This policy review analyzes selected articles by the PubMed searcher about extreme measures taken in several countries during precedent pandemics and the current pandemic, and selects hard decisions relating to the exceptional measures taken by judicial departments in Brazil, connecting them to the “collision of fundamental rights and law principles.” The collision of rights and principles imposed on decision makers a duty to provide balanced rights, and to adopt the enforcement of some rights prioritization. Ethical concerns were also verified in this field involving rights limitations. During a pandemic, the importance of extreme measures to protect health rights and healthcare systems is instrumental for focused, fast, and correct decision making to avoid loss of life and the collapse of healthcare systems. The main goals of this research are to discuss the implications and guidelines for public health decision making, the indispensable ethical and legal aspects for safeguarding health systems and the lives of people, and the respect of the Justice principle and of fundamental health and dignity rights. We conclude that COVID-19 justifies the prioritization of collective and individual health access rights. Acceptable standards of fundamental rights restrictions are established at the constitutional and international levels and must be enforced by rules and governmental action, to ensure fast and accurate decision making during a pandemic. Freedom rights exercises must be linked to solidarity for the realization of social welfare, for the health rights of all individuals and for health systems to function well during a pandemic. Actionable Recommendations: All individuals are free and equal, therefore social exclusion is prohibited. Institutions must consider social inequalities when discussing public health measures and be guided by ethical standards, by law principles, and rules recognized by constitutional and international law for the benefit of all during a health pandemic. Conclusions: Collective and individual health rights prevail over the collision of rights when facing pandemic occurrences, case by case, in health systems protection, based on the literature, on precedent pandemics and on legitimate Public Health efforts.","dos Santos, José Luiz Gondim; Stein Messetti, Paulo André; Adami, Fernando; Bezerra, Italla Maria Pinheiro; Maia, Paula Christianne G.

Studies have reported that women are initiating or returning to running after childbirth with up to 35% reporting pain. There are no studies exploring running-related pain or risk factors for this pain after childbirth in runners. Postpartum runners have a variety of biomechanical, musculoskeletal, and physiologic impairments from which to recover from when returning to high impact sports like running, which could influence initiating or returning to running. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify risk factors associated with running-related pain in postpartum runners with and without pain. This study also aimed to understand the compounding effects of multiple associative risk factors by developing a clinical decision tool to identify postpartum runners at higher risk for pain. METHODS: Postpartum runners with at least one child ≤36 months who ran once a week and postpartum runners unable to run because of pain, but identified as runners, were surveyed. Running variables (mileage, time to first postpartum run), postpartum variables (delivery type, breastfeeding, incontinence, sleep, fatigue, depression), and demographic information were collected. Risk factors for running-related pain were analyzed in bivariate regression models. Variables meeting criteria (P<0.15) were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model to create a clinical decision tool. The tool identified compounding factors that increased the probability of having running-related pain after childbirth. RESULTS: Analyses included 538 postpartum runners; 176 (32.7%) reporting running-related pain. Eleven variables were included in the multivariate model with six retained in the clinical decision tool: runner type-novice (OR 3.51; 95% CI 1.65, 7.48), postpartum accumulated fatigue score of >19 (OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.44, 4.28), previous running injury (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.31, 2.91), vaginal delivery (OR 1.63; 95% CI 1.06, 2.50), incontinence (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.31, 2.84) and <6.8 hours of sleep on average per night (OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.28, 2.78). Having ≥ 4 risk factors increased the probability of having running-related pain to 61.2%. CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide a deeper understanding of the risk factors for running-related pain in postpartum runners. With this information, clinicians can monitor and educate postpartum runners initiating or returning to running. Education could include details of risk factors, combinations of factors for pain and strategies to mitigate risks. Coaches can adapt running workload accounting for fatigue and sleep fluctuations to optimize recovery and performance. Future longitudinal studies that follow asymptomatic postpartum women returning to running after childbirth over time should be performed to validate these findings.","Christopher, Shefali Mathur; Cook, Chad E.; Snodgrass, Suzanne J.",PLoS One,670,30

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses an RdRP for the replication of its genome and the transcription of its genes. Here, the silver ions (Ag(+)) in the hexathia-18-crown-6 (HT18C6) were used for the first time as a redox probe. Then, the HT18C6(Ag) incorporated carbon paste electrode (CPE) was further modified with chitosan and PAMAM dendrimer-coated silicon quantum dots (SiQDs@PAMAM) for immobilization of probe sequences (aminated oligonucleotides). The current intensity of differential pulse voltammetry using the redox probe was found to decrease with increasing the concentration of target sequence. Based on such signal-off trend, the proposed genosensor exhibited a good linear response to SARS-CoV-2 RdRP in the concentration range 1.0 pM–8.0 nM with a regression equation I (μA) = − 6.555 log [RdRP sequence] (pM) + 32.676 (R(2) = 0.995) and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.3 pM. The standard addition method with different spike concentrations of RdRP sequence in human sputum samples showed a good recovery for real sample analysis (> 95%). Therefore, the developed voltammetric genosensor can be used to determine SARS-CoV-2 RdRP sequence in sputum samples.

One hundred twenty diverse bread wheat genotypes were used in a pot experiment to explore the relationship among their fifteen physio-biochemical traits (PBT) by using multivariate analysis, heatmapping and stress tolerance index (STI) for grain yield as a marker trait to identify high yielding genotype with maximum stress tolerance capability. Increased proline and sugar accumulation were observed from control to moisture deficient environments by 159% and 122%, respectively. Moreover, leaf membrane stability index (LMSI), leaf relative water content (LRWC), relative dry weight (RDW), chlorophyll content, leaf surface area (LSA), Leaf succulence (LS), canopy temperature depression (CTD), relative excised leaf water loss (RELWL) and leaf osmotic potential (LOP) showed significantly decreasing trend in drought stress treatment as compared to well-watered plants by -21%, -21%, -34%, -22%, -38%, -37%, -46%, -18% and -35% respectively. Additionally, principal component analysis and genotype by trait biplot analysis showed that initial 7 principal components (PC1 to PC7) represented 77.27% and 79.02% of total cumulative variation under control and drought stress respectively. Genotypic-Phenotypic correlation revealed that most of the attributes were higher in case of genotypic correlation component (rg) as compared to the phenotypic correlation component (rp) indicating more genetic association between traits.

The tuberculosis (TB) research community has openly admitted to a vacuum of knowledge about neonatal and infant immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, especially in the functional and phenotypic attributes of memory T cell responses elicited by the only available vaccine for TB, the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine. Although BCG vaccination has variable efficacy in preventing pulmonary TB during adolescence and adulthood, 80% of endemic TB countries still administer BCG at birth because it has a good safety profile and protects children from severe forms of TB. As such, new vaccines must work in conjunction with BCG at birth and, thus, it is essential to understand how BCG shapes the immune system during the first months of life. However, many aspects of the neonatal and infant immune response elicited by vaccination with BCG remain unknown, as only a handful of studies have followed BCG responses in infants. Furthermore, most animal models currently used to study TB vaccine candidates rely on adult-aged animals. This presents unique challenges when transitioning to human trials in neonates or infants. In this Review, we focus on vaccine development in the field of TB and compare the relative utility of animal models used thus far to study neonatal and infant immunity. We encourage the development of neonatal animal models for TB, especially the use of pigs.","Ramos, Laylaa; Lunney, Joan K.; Gonzalez-Juarrero, Mercedes",Dis Model Mech,670,1

To mitigate transmission of COVID-19 at polling locations, jurisdictions have adopted changes to protocols and procedures, informed by CDC's interim guidance, developed in collaboration with the Election Assistance Commission (2). The driving principle for this guidance is that voting practices with lower infection risk will be those which reduce the number of voters who congregate indoors in polling locations by offering a variety of methods for voting and longer voting periods. The guidance for in-person voting includes considerations for election officials, poll workers, and voters to maintain healthy environments and operations. To assess knowledge and adoption of mitigation strategies, CDC collaborated with the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services and the Delaware State Election Commission on a survey of poll workers who served during the statewide primary election on September 15, 2020. Among 522 eligible poll workers, 93% correctly answered all three survey questions about COVID-19 transmission. Respondents noted that most voters and poll workers wore masks. However, masks were not always worn correctly (i.e., covering both the nose and mouth). Responses suggest that mitigation measures recommended for both poll workers and voters were widely adopted and feasible, but also highlighted gaps in infection prevention control efforts. Strengthening of measures intended to minimize the risk of poll workers acquiring COVID-19 from ill voters, such as additional training and necessary personal protective equipment (PPE), as well as support for alternative voting options for ill voters, are needed. Adherence to mitigation measures is important not only to protect voters but also to protect poll workers, many of whom are older adults, and thus at higher risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness. Enhanced attention to reducing congregation in polling locations, correct mask use, and providing safe voting options for ill voters are critical considerations to minimize risk to voters and poll workers. Evidence from the Delaware election supports the feasibility and acceptability of implementing current CDC guidance for election officials, poll workers, and voters for mitigating COVID-19 transmission at polling locations (2).","Leidman, Eva; Hall, Noemi B.; Kirby, Amy E.; Garcia-Williams, Amanda G.; Aponte, Jose; Yoder, Jonathan S.; Hong, Rick; Albence, Anthony; Coronado, Fátima; Massetti, Greta M.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,670,0

AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the structure and severity of psychological distress and stigmatization in different categories of health-care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included two phases of online survey in 1800 Russian-speaking health-care workers (March 30 – April 5 and May 4 – May 10, 2020). The Psychological Stress Scale (PSM-25) and modified Perceived Devaluation-Discrimination scale (Cronbach's α = 0.74) were used. Dispersion analysis was performed with P = 0.05, Cohen's d, and Cramer's V calculated (effect size [ES]). RESULTS: The psychological stress levels decreased in the second phase (ES = 0.13), while the stigma levels (ES = 0.33) increased. Physicians experienced more stress compared with nurses and paramedical personnel (ES = 0.34; 0.64), but were less likely to stigmatize SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals (ES = 0.43; 0.41). The increasing probability of contact with infected individuals was associated with higher levels of psychological stress (probable contact ES = 0.48; definite contact ES=0.97). The highest rates of contacts with COVID-19 patients were reported by physicians (χ(2) = 123.0; P = 0.00, Cramer's V = 0.2), the youngest (ES = 0.5), and less experienced medical workers (ES = 0.33). CONCLUSION: Direct contact with coronavirus infection is associated with a significant increase in stress among medical personnel. The pandemic compromises the psychological well-being of the youngest and highly qualified specialists. However, the stigmatizing reactions are not directly associated with the risks of infection and are most prevalent among nurses and paramedical personnel.","Sorokin, Mikhail Yu.; Kasyanov, Evgeny D.; Rukavishnikov, Grigory V.; Makarevich, Olga V.; Neznanov, Nikolay G.; Morozov, Petr V.; Lutova, Natalia B.; Mazo, Galina E.",Indian J Psychiatry,670,1

To meet current requirements for COVID-19 diagnosis, it is highly important to develop an automated diagnosis model to identify the disease accurately and at a faster rate. According to COVID-19 radiographical changes in computed tomography images, this research designed a machine learning–based diagnosis model using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with a rough neural network (RNN), called a DWT-RNN model. Moreover, principal component analysis was conducted to reduce the subset of features before classification. The DWT-RNN model was validated using a COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset. The experimental outcome was validated for several aspects and the obtained results show that the DWT-RNN model offers maximum classification performance and saves time in controlling diseases.","Pustokhina, Irina Valeryevna; Pustokhin, Denis Alexandrovich; Shankar, K.",Data Science for COVID-19,670,1

However, limited data are available about COVID-19 during pregnancy. This study aimed to assess the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19, and the adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. DESIGN: This retrospective analytical cohort study was conducted on all pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 at Nekouei-Hedayati-Forghani Hospital in Qom, Iran from 1 February 2019 to 15 September 2020. For the same period, 165 pregnant women who did not have COVID-19 were selected at random and included in this study. All epidemiological and clinical features were collected from the medical records of the participants. A logistic regression model was used to determine associations between COVID-19 in pregnancy and maternal and fetal outcomes. FINDINGS: The most common symptoms reported by pregnant women with COVID-19 were shortness of breath (60.9%), dry cough (59%) and fever (42.9%). After adjustment for potential confounding factors, COVID-19 in pregnancy was associated with a significantly higher risk of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) [odds ratio (OR) 6.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23–31], caesarean section (OR 0.45, 95 CI 0.25–1.03), preterm birth (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.4–6.54), fetal distress (OR 5.7, 95% CI 2.13–15.59) and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.21–7.70).

In Malaysia, the National Strategic Plan for Non-Communicable Diseases (2015–2025) provides the overall framework for its response to the non-communicable diseases (NCD) epidemic. Preventing childhood obesity is one of the key strategies for early intervention to prevent NCDs. The objective of this research is to examine the current status of policy interventions in addressing childhood obesity in Malaysia. (2) Methods: A panel of 22 stakeholders and experts from Malaysia, representing the government, industry, academia and non-governmental organizations, were sampled using a modified Delphi technique. Data were collected using a modified NCD scorecard under four domains (governance, risk factors, surveillance and research and health systems response). A heat map was used to measure the success of the four realms of the NCD scorecard. For each domain of the NCD scorecard, the final score was grouped in quintiles. (3) Results: A total of 22 participants responded, comprising of eight (36.4%) males and 14 (63.4%) females. All the domains measured in implementing policies related to childhood obesity were of low progress. Nine governance indicators were reported as 22.5% (low progress), four in the risk factors domain, and two in the surveillance. This shows that timely and accurate monitoring, participatory review and evaluation, and effective remedies are necessary for a country’s surveillance system. (4) Conclusion: Although Malaysia has published several key strategic documents relating to childhood obesity and implemented numerous policy interventions, we have identified several gaps that must be addressed to leverage the whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach in addressing childhood obesity in the country.","Mok, Wilfred Kok Hoe; Hairi, Noran Naqiah; Chan, Caryn Mei Hsien; Mustapha, Feisul Idzwan; Saminathan, Thamil Arasu; Low, Wah Yun",Int J Environ Res Public Health,670,12

However, the molecular mechanisms of the host-virus interaction remain poorly understood. Here, we profiled the expression of mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in THP-1 cells using the emerging RNA-seq to investigate the transcriptional changes during HCMV latent infection. At 4 days post HCMV infection, a total of 169,008,624 sequence reads and 180,616 transcripts were obtained, respectively. Of these transcripts, 1,354 noncoding genes and 12,952 protein-coding genes were observed in Refseq database. Differential gene expression analysis identified 2,153 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HCMV-infected and mock-infected THP-1 cells, including 1,098 up-regulated genes and 1,055 down-regulated genes. These regulated genes were involved in pathways of apoptosis, inflammatory response and cell cycle progression, all of which may be implicated in viral pathogenesis. In addition, 646 lncRNAs (208 known lncRNAs and 438 novel lncRNAs) were upregulated and 424 (140 known and 284 novel) were downregulated in infected THP-1 cells. These findings have provided a dynamic scenario of DE candidate genes and lncRNAs at the virus-host interface and clearly warrant further experimental investigation associated with HCMV infection.","Zhang, Qi; Lai, Mei-Mei; Lou, Yun-Yan; Guo, Bin-Han; Wang, Hui-Yan; Zheng, Xiao-Qun",Gene,670,22

At the same time, affirmative action policies are controversial and legally fraught. The Supreme Court has ruled that affirmative action should help a minoritized group achieve a critical mass of representation. While the idea of critical mass is frequently invoked in law and in policy, the term remains ill-defined and hence difficult to operationalize. Motivated by these challenges, we build a mathematical model to forecast undergraduate student body racial/ethnic demographics on public university campuses. Our model takes the form of a Markov chain that tracks students through application, admission, matriculation, retention, and graduation. Using publicly available data, we calibrate our model for two different campuses within the University of California system, test it for accuracy, and make a 10-year prediction. We also propose a coarse definition of critical mass and use our model to assess progress towards it at the University of California-Berkeley. If no policy changes are made over the next decade, we predict that the Latinx population on campus will move towards critical mass but not achieve it, and that the Black student population will decrease, moving further below critical mass. Because affirmative action is banned in California and in nine other states, it is worthwhile to consider alternative policies for diversifying a campus, including targeted recruitment and retention efforts. Our modeling framework provides a setting in which to test the efficacy of affirmative action and of these alternative policies.","Maes, Daniel P.; Tucher, Julia; Topaz, Chad M.",PLoS One,670,1

METHODS: This three-year case study (2017–2020) used a convergent parallel, mixed-methods design. The approach was guided by community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles, the Comprehensive Participatory Planning and Evaluation process, and Nine Habits of Successful Comprehensive Cancer Control Coalitions. Meeting artifacts were tracked and evaluated. CAB members completed quantitative surveys at three time points and semi-structured interviews at two time points. Quantitative data were analyzed using analysis of variance tests. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed via an inductive-deductive process. RESULTS: Through 13 meetings, Prevention and Early Detection Action Teams created causal models and prioritized four cancer control needs: human papillomavirus vaccination, tobacco control, colorectal cancer screening, and lung cancer screening. These sub-groups also began advancing into planning and intervention proposal development phases. As rated by 49 involved CAB members, all habits significantly improved from Time 1 to Time 2 (i.e., communication, priority work plans, roles/accountability, shared decision making, value-added collaboration, empowered leadership, diversified funding, trust, satisfaction; all p < .05), and most remained significantly higher at Time 3. CAB members also identified specific challenges (e.g., fully utilizing member expertise), strengths (e.g., diverse membership), and recommendations across habits.

METHODS: To account for health consequences, we estimated mortality for HCWs and present a cost-effectiveness and return on investment (ROI) analysis using a decision-analytic model with Bayesian multivariate sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. Data sources included inputs from the World Health Organization Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool and the Imperial College of London epidemiologic model. RESULTS: An investment of $9.6 billion USD would adequately protect HCWs in all LMICs. This intervention would save 2,299,543 lives across LMICs, costing $59 USD per HCW case averted and $4,309 USD per HCW life saved. The societal ROI would be $755.3 billion USD, the equivalent of a 7,932% return. Regional and national estimates are also presented. DISCUSSION: In scenarios where PPE remains scarce, 70–100% of HCWs will get infected, irrespective of nationwide social distancing policies. Maintaining HCW infection rates below 10% and mortality below 1% requires inclusion of a PPE scale-up strategy as part of the pandemic response. In conclusion, wide-scale procurement and distribution of PPE for LMICs is an essential strategy to prevent widespread HCW morbidity and mortality. It is cost-effective and yields a large downstream return on investment.","Risko, Nicholas; Werner, Kalin; Offorjebe, O.

Data Synthesis Pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection are at high risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome and adverse outcomes. Pregnant women with severe COVID-19 present increased rates of preterm delivery (<37 gestational weeks), cesarean delivery and neonatal admissions to the intensive care unit. Comorbidity such as diabetes (pregestational or gestational) or obesity further increased maternal and fetal complications. It is known that diabetic or obese patients with COVID-19 present an unfavorable course and a worse prognosis, with a direct association between worse outcome and suboptimal glycol-metabolic control or body mass index (BMI) levels. Critical COVID-19 infection prevention is important for both mother and fetus. Vaccination during pregnancy is a common practice. Vaccines against COVID-19 are distributed across the world with some population considered to have a priority. Since pregnant women are excluded from clinical trials very little information are available on safety and efficacy of COVD-19 vaccines during pregnancy. However, it is well known the concept of passive immunization of the newborn obtained with transplacental passage of protective antibodies into the fetal/neonatal circulation after maternal infection or vaccination. Moreover, it has been reported that COVID-19 vaccine-induced IgG pass to the neonates through breastmilk. Therefore, maternal vaccination can protect mother, fetus and baby. Conclusions After an individual risk/benefit evaluation pregnant and lactating women should be counselled to receive COVID-19 vaccines.","Sculli, Maria Angela; Formoso, Gloria; Sciacca, Laura",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,670,1

METHODS: This is a subset of the cohort “Influence of nutritional therapy on clinical prognosis in patients with COVID-19: a multicenter retrospective cohort study”. Clinical and nutrition assistance information (type of assistance, evaluation of anthropometric status, and time of introduction of nutritional therapy) and presence of diabetes, hypertension and previous respiratory disease were collected from electronic medical records. To evaluate the association between the variables of interest and mortality, the hazard ratio was estimated. RESULTS: We evaluated 153 critically ill patients ≥18 years old, affected by COVID-19, with a rate of mortality of 77.8%.

This special issue highlights how meiofauna can help freshwater ecologists to describe and predict species distribution patterns, to assess production of biomass and trait functions relationships, as well as to examine the trophic links between microscopic and macroscopic worlds and to better understand species’ resilience to environmental extremes. Overall, meiofaunal organisms are bridging scales, and as such they deserve better integration to develop more comprehensive concepts and theories in ecology.","Majdi, Nabil; Schmid-Araya, Jenny M.; Traunspurger, Walter",Hydrobiologia,670,29

The illegal wildlife trade (IWT) creates opportunity for emerging infectious disease (EID) events to occur. EIDs are a major threat to wildlife, ecosystems, and public health. This study addresses the lack of comprehensive review of pathogens identified in IWT and highlights the expansion of literature on this subject over the past 30 years. We reviewed 82 scientific papers and conference proceedings from 1990 to 2020. Trends in EIDs identified in IWT have significantly increased over the past decade. Cases covered 240 pathogens across all taxa. Approximately 60% of the pathogens identified were zoonotic (transmissible between animals and humans) and threaten public health. Based on our findings, we recommend further research is needed to monitor and prevent the IWT. ABSTRACT: Emerging infectious disease (EID) events can be traced to anthropogenic factors, including the movement of wildlife through legal and illegal trade. This paper focuses on the link between illegal wildlife trade (IWT) and infectious disease pathogens. A literature review through Web of Science and relevant conference proceedings from 1990 to 2020 resulted in documenting 82 papers and 240 identified pathogen cases. Over 60% of the findings referred to pathogens with known zoonotic potential and five cases directly referenced zoonotic spillover events. The diversity of pathogens by taxa included 44 different pathogens in birds, 47 in mammals, 16 in reptiles, two in amphibians, two in fish, and one in invertebrates. This is the highest diversity of pathogen types in reported literature related to IWT. However, it is likely not a fully representative sample due to needed augmentation of surveillance and monitoring of IWT and more frequent pathogen testing on recovered shipments. The emergence of infectious disease through human globalization has resulted in several pandemics in the last decade including SARS, MERS, avian influenza H1N1,and Ebola. We detailed the growing body of literature on this topic since 2008 and highlight the need to detect, document, and prevent spillovers from high-risk human activities, such as IWT.","Rush, Elizabeth R.; Dale, Erin; Aguirre, A.

We used six kits available in Japan in 13 NAAT-positive specimens with crossing point values >36 and 7 NAAT-negative specimens from patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19); their results were compared. Specimens positive in ≥2 assays were considered true positive and examined for concordance with specimen results. The SARS-CoV-2 Detection Kit -Multi- (Toyobo M) (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) using extracted RNA had the highest concordance (κ 1.00). This was followed by the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 (Cobas) (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) (κ 0.79). There was a weak correlation between number of negative results for each kit and days between onset and testing (Spearman rank correlation: ρ= 0.44; p<0.05). We believe that the variations in results among kits for specimens with low viral loads should not be problematic when these kits are used for screening infectious patients because these variations are more likely to be observed in specimens tested many days after onset (i.e., those that have lost their infectivity). However, for suspected late-stage COVID-19 with a low viral load, it may be better to use a test such as Toyobo M or Cobas.","Motohashi, Ayano; Yamamoto, Kei; Mezaki, Kazuhisa; Moriya, Ataru; Kurokawa, Masami; Oki, Hitoshi; Ando, Honami; Isaka, Erina; Usami, Ayaka; Ide, Satoshi; Nakamura, Keiji; Nakamoto, Takahito; Nomoto, Hidetoshi; Ohmagari, Norio",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,670,16

Therefore, strict medication adherence is essential to avoid poor health outcomes especially during health crises like the current COVID-19 pandemic. The aims of our study were to identify the predictors of medication non-adherence in elderly and to expose the role of the emergency department (ED) to improve the therapeutic adherence during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: it was a two steps study. Primary, an observational, prospective survey over one month, including 100 elderly patients consulting to the emergency department. Medication adherence was assessed by Morisky's 4-questions scale; predictors of non-adherence have been identified. Secondary, a report of elderly medication management by the emergency physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic confinement. RESULTS: first step: 100 patients, mean age of 73±8 years. The average number of drugs was 4±2. Medication non-adherence was reported in 39%, predictors of therapeutic non-adherence were: polypharmacy (OR=2.41; CI95% [1.60;3.61]), rural origin (OR=6.72; CI95% [1.47;30.63]) and metabolic diseases history (OR=5.24; CI95% [1.48;18.53]). In the second step, 816 elder lies were enrolled, mean age: 73±7 years. The therapeutic attitude in the emergency department was to prescribe the same treatment (60%) to adjust the doses of the drugs prescribed (14%) to stop one or more drugs (13%) or to indicate new treatments (13%). Thirty-five percent of patients were admitted for short-term hospitalization. CONCLUSION: medication non-adherence is common in elderly, due to several factors. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergency services in Tunisia played an important role in the follow-up and therapeutic continuity of these elderly patients.","Nouira, Nourelhouda; Bahria, Wided; Hamdi, Dhekra; Lahouegue, Amira; Demni, Wiem; Cheikh, Maamoun Ben",Pan Afr Med J,670,16

Indeed, the presence of physical frailty has recently led to higher mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, no longitudinal studies have investigated the role of neuropsychogeriatric factors associated with lockdown fatigue in healthy cognitive aging. Eighty-one healthy older adults were evaluated for their neuropsychological characteristics, including physical frailty, before the pandemic (T0). Subsequently, 50 of them agreed to be interviewed and neuropsychologically re-assessed during the lockdown (T1) and immediately after it (T2). Moreover, during another home confinement, they performed a psychological screening (T3) to evaluate possible mood changes and fatigue. According to Fried's frailty criteria, at T0, 63% of the sample was robust, 34.5% pre-frail, and only 2.5% frail. Significantly, these subjects presented a decrease in handgrip strength and walking speed (29.6 and 6.1%, respectively). Results from Principal Component Analyses and multiple regression models highlighted the contribution of “cognitive” and “psychological” factors (i.e., attentive-executive performance and mood deflections) in explaining handgrip strength and gait speed. At T3, lockdown fatigue was explained by higher scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and lower scores on the Trail Making Test part A. Results from a moderated-mediation model showed that the effect of psychomotor speed on lockdown fatigue was mediated by depression, with a moderating effect of gait speed. Our findings highlight the complex interrelationship between cognitive, psychological, and physical factors in the emergence of pandemic fatigue in a carefully selected older population.","Amanzio, Martina; Canessa, Nicola; Bartoli, Massimo; Cipriani, Giuseppina Elena; Palermo, Sara; Cappa, Stefano F.",Front Psychol,670,30

The risk factors associated with COVID-19 in patients with hypertension are unknown. METHODS: All the available and confirmed patients with COVID-19 from February 3 to March 10, 2020, were enrolled from Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China. The demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, laboratory data, radiological assessments, and treatments on admission were extracted and compared. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to explore risk factors associated with COVID-19 in patients with hypertension and the severity of the cohort. RESULTS: A total of 430 available patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study, including 151 eligible patients with COVID-19 and hypertension. After PSM analysis, 141 patients without hypertension and 141 cases with hypertension were well matched. Compared with cases without hypertension, patients with hypertension were more severe (28.4% vs. 12.1%, p=0.001). In multivariate analysis, we found that neutrophil count (OR: 1.471; p=0.001), coronary heart disease (OR: 5.281; p=0.011), and the level of K(+) (OR: 0.273; p < 0.001) were associated with patients with hypertension.

CONCLUSION: On admission, coronary heart disease, neutrophil count, and the level of K(+) were associated with COVID-19 patients with hypertension. The percentage of the pulmonary infection volume was significantly larger in COVID-19 patients with hypertension and was a risk factor for COVID-19 severity of the cohort.","Wang, Xinxin; Zhang, Haihua; Du, Huan; Ma, Ruina; Nan, Yandong; Zhang, Tao",Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol,670,26

However, little is known regarding the potential role of the talin–vinculin complex during spotted fever group rickettsial and Ebola virus infections, two dreadful infectious diseases in humans. Many functional properties of proteins are determined by their participation in protein–protein complexes, in a temporal and/or spatial manner. To resolve the limitation of application in using mouse primary antibodies on archival, multiple formalin-fixed mouse tissue samples, which were collected from experiments requiring high biocontainment, we developed a practical strategic proximity ligation assay (PLA) capable of employing one primary antibody raised in mouse to probe talin–vinculin spatial proximal complex in mouse tissue. We observed an increase of talin–vinculin spatial proximities in the livers of spotted fever Rickettsia australis or Ebola virus-infected mice when compared with mock mice. Furthermore, using EPAC1-knockout mice, we found that deletion of EPAC1 could suppress the formation of spatial proximal complex of talin–vinculin in rickettsial infections. In addition, we observed increased colocalization between spatial proximity of talin–vinculin and filamentous actin-specific phalloidin staining in single survival mouse from an ordinarily lethal dose of rickettsial or Ebola virus infection. These findings may help to delineate a fresh insight into the mechanisms underlying liver specific pathogenesis during infection with spotted fever rickettsia or Ebola virus in the mouse model.","Liu, Yakun; Xiao, Jie; Zhang, Ben; Shelite, Thomas R.; Su, Zhengchen; Chang, Qing; Judy, Barbara; Li, Xiang; Drelich, Aleksandra; Bei, Jiani; Zhou, Yixuan; Zheng, Junying; Jin, Yang; Rossi, Shannan L.; Tang, Shao-Jun; Wakamiya, Maki; Saito, Tais; Ksiazek, Thomas; Kaphalia, Bhupendra; Gong, Bin",Lab Invest,670,1

No studies have yet summarized the potential severity and mortality risks caused by COVID-19 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and we update information in smokers. METHODS: We systematically searched electronic databases from inception to March 24, 2020. Data were extracted by two independent authors in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We synthesized a narrative from eligible studies and conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to calculate pooled prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: In total, 123 abstracts were screened and 61 full-text manuscripts were reviewed. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, which included a total of 2473 confirmed COVID-19 patients. All studies were included in the meta-analysis. The crude case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 7.4%. The pooled prevalence rates of COPD patients and smokers in COVID-19 cases were 2% (95% CI, 1%–3%) and 9% (95% CI, 4%–14%) respectively. COPD patients were at a higher risk of more severe disease (risk of severity = 63%, (22/35) compared to patients without COPD 33.4% (409/1224) [calculated RR, 1.88 (95% CI, 1.4–2.4)]. This was associated with higher mortality (60%). Our results showed that 22% (31/139) of current smokers and 46% (13/28) of ex-smokers had severe complications. The calculated RR showed that current smokers were 1.45 times more likely [95% CI: 1.03–2.04] to have severe complications compared to former and never smokers. Current smokers also had a higher mortality rate of 38.5%. CONCLUSION: Although COPD prevalence in COVID-19 cases was low in current reports, COVID-19 infection was associated with substantial severity and mortality rates in COPD. Compared to former and never smokers, current smokers were at greater risk of severe complications and higher mortality rate. Effective preventive measures are required to reduce COVID-19 risk in COPD patients and current smokers.","Alqahtani, Jaber S.; Oyelade, Tope; Aldhahir, Abdulelah M.; Alghamdi, Saeed M.; Almehmadi, Mater; Alqahtani, Abdullah S.; Quaderi, Shumonta; Mandal, Swapna; Hurst, John R.",PLoS One,670,17

This study aimed to verify an association between mortality and the energy and protein provided to critically ill patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 and receiving enteral nutrition support. METHODS: Patients with confirmed COVID-19, with >7 days of stay in the ICU, on enteral nutrition were followed from the moment of hospitalization until discharge from the ICU or death. Data about age, gender, Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS3), intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, days on mechanical ventilation (MV), clinical endpoint outcome (discharge or death), and daily energy and protein provision were collected from electronic medical records. Cox regression analyses and Kaplan-Meyer curves were used in statistical analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (66.2 ± 13.1 years; 53.8% women) were enrolled in the present study. The mean length of hospitalizations and SAPS3 score were 17.8 ± 9.8 days and 78.7 ± 14.7, respectively; all patients needed mechanical ventilation (mean of days was 16.42 ± 9.1). For most patients (73.1%) the endpoint was death. Twenty-five percent of patients had protein supply >0.8 g/IBW/day. Survival during COVID-19 hospitalization at ICU was significantly different among patients according to protein supply (p = 0.005). Hazard Ratios (HR) for protein supply showed that a protein intake >0.8 g/IBW/day was associated with significantly lower mortality (HR 0.322, p = 0.049). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that a protein supply at least > 0.8 g/IBW/day could be related to reduced mortality in ICU patients with COVID-19.","Silvah, Jose Henrique; de Lima, Cristiane Maria Martires; Nicoletti, Carolina Ferreira; Barbosa, Ana Carolina; Junqueira, Gizela Pedroso; da Cunha, Selma Freire de Carvalho; Marchini, Julio Sergio",Clin Nutr ESPEN,670,16

The aim of this minireview is to present epidemiological data related to metabolic comorbidities in association with the SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This is a narrative mini-review with Pubmed search until April 23, 2020 using the keywords COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, treatment of coronavirus and following terms: diabetes mellitus, obesity, arterial hypertension, ACE-inhibitors, cytokine storm, immune response and vitamin D. RESULTS: Studies indicate that obese individuals are more likely to develop infections, and that adipose tissue serves as a pathogen reservoir. In diabetic individuals higher rate of inflammatory processes is seen due to constant glucose recognition by C type lectin receptors. Hypertensive individuals, usually grouped with other conditions, are treated with drugs to reduce blood pressure mostly through ACEi and ARB, that leads to increased ACE2 expression, used by SARS-CoV-2 for human's cell entry. Until now, the studies have shown that individuals with those conditions and affected by COVID-19 present an uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an unbalanced immune response, leading to the cytokine storm phenomenon. Vitamin D is highlighted as a potential therapeutic target, because in addition to acting on the immune system, it plays an important role in the control of cardiometabolic diseases. CONCLUSION: Currently, since there is no proven and effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2, the efforts should focus on controlling inflammatory response and reduce the risks of associated complications.","de Lucena, Thays Maria Costa; da Silva Santos, Ariane Fernandes; de Lima Fabrício, Brenda Regina; de Albuquerque Borborema, Maria Eduarda; de Azevêdo Silva, Jaqueline",Diabetes Metab Syndr,670,27

Elite athletes may seek care for sports-related injuries and pre-existing oral diseases. Previous studies indicate an association between oral health problems and negative performance impacts in elite athletes. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of the most common oral pathologies in high-performance athletes during the emergency dental care performed at the Lima 2019 Pan American Games (JPL-19). METHODOLOGY: All reports of athletes (≥18 years old, of both sexes, from 41 countries) who received emergency dental care at Pan American Villas during the JPL-19 were included. Injuries and types of oral diseases were classified according to the Injury and Disease Surveillance System proposed by the International Olympic Committee. RESULTS: Of the 6680 participating athletes, 76 (1.14%) presented as dental emergencies, 90.8% (69/76) of the athletes seen presented pre-existing oral pathological conditions, the most frequent were periodontal diseases (34%, 26/76) and dental caries (29%, 22/76). Among the sports with the most cases, there were 22 (29%) in athletics, 6 (8%) in soccer, and 6 (8%) in taekwondo. The most frequent dental emergencies came from Peru, Puerto Rico, Bahamas, Grenada, and Venezuela. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-existing oral diseases were more frequent than sports-related accidents. The most prevalent diseases were periodontal disease and dental caries disease. It is necessary to implement new care strategies for athletes, based on prevention, before and during sports competitions.","Opazo-García, Catalina; Moya-Salazar, Jeel; Chicoma-Flores, Karina; Contreras-Pulache, Hans",BDJ Open,670,1

WEIGHING OF RISKS IS NECESSARY IN POLICY DEVELOPMENT: Such policies are risky as was shown in the early response to the HIV pandemic where efforts to prevent mother to child transmission by replacing breastfeeding with infant formula feeding ultimately resulted in more infant deaths. In the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of maternal SARS-CoV-2 transmission needs to be weighed against the protection skin-to-skin contact, maternal proximity, and breastfeeding affords infants. CONCLUSION: Policy makers and practitioners need to learn from the mistakes of the HIV pandemic and not undermine breastfeeding in the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: Recruitment used school communication, community organisations and snowball sampling in South West England. Audio recorded online or phone individual/group semi-structured interviews were conducted in July–Septtember 2020 and lasted 30–60 min. Interviews focused on views towards social distancing, hand hygiene and testing. Framework analysis was performed on interview notes/transcripts. RESULTS: Participants were 15 staff, 20 parents and 17 students (11–16 years) from 14 diverse schools. Concerns about COVID-19 risk at school, especially to vulnerable individuals, were outweighed by perceived risks of missed learning. Some staff felt guilt around being a potential ‘spreader’ by teaching multiple classes. Findings highlighted a wide variety of school COVID-19 mitigation measures being deployed due to ambiguous government guidance. Participants generally saw mitigation measures as an acceptable and pragmatic solution to the perceived impossibility of social distancing in crowded schools, although anticipated challenges changing habitual behaviour. Participants supported school COVID-19 testing but identified the need to consider data security and stigma around COVID-19 diagnosis. Staff were concerned about unintended consequences of risk-reduction strategies on student behaviour, learning and pastoral care, particularly for those with Special Educational Needs or mental health issues who may find the measures especially challenging, and resultant widening inequalities. CONCLUSION: Families and staff supported COVID-19 mitigation measures in schools and would welcome the roll out school COVID-19 testing. Clear messaging and engendering collective responsibility are important for compliance and success of COVID-19 mitigation measures. However, schools and policy-makers should consider unintended consequences of measures, providing extra support for vulnerable students and those with additional needs, and consider ways to avoid widening educational and health inequalities. Findings demonstrate the acceptability of school COVID-19 infection control measures is likely to be influenced by the balance of risks and benefits to students.","Lorenc, Ava; Kesten, Joanna May; Kidger, Judi; Langford, Rebecca; Horwood, Jeremy",BMJ Paediatr Open,670,19

Entry of coronaviruses into host cells is mediated by the spike (S) protein. In our previous ESR studies, the local membrane ordering effect of the fusion peptide (FP) of various viral glycoproteins including the S of SARS-1 and MERS has been consistently observed. We previously determined that the sequence immediately downstream from the S2’ cleavage site is the bona fide SARS-1 FP. In this study, we used sequence alignment to identify the SARS-2 FP, and studied its membrane ordering effect. Although there are only three residue difference, SARS-2 FP induces even greater membrane ordering than SARS-1 FP, possibly due to its greater hydrophobicity. This may be a reason that SARS-2 is better able to infect host cells. In addition, the membrane binding enthalpy for SARS-2 is greater. Both the membrane ordering of SARS-2 and SARS-1 FPs are dependent on Ca2+, but that of SARS-2 shows a greater response to the presence of Ca2+. Both FPs bind two Ca2+ ions as does SARS-1 FP, but the two Ca2+ binding sites of SARS-2 exhibit greater cooperativity. This Ca2+ dependence by the SARS-2 FP is very ion-specific. These results show that Ca2+ is an important regulator that interacts with the SARS-2 FP and thus plays a significant role in SARS-2 viral entry. This could lead to therapeutic solutions that either target the FP-calcium interaction or block the Ca2+ channel.","Lai, Alex L.; Freed, Jack H.",bioRxiv,670,20

OBJECTIVES: A real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed and used to detect and quantify hMPV in respiratory specimens. STUDY DESIGN: The quantitative RT-PCR assay amplified an approximately 70 base pair fragment from the hMPV fusion protein gene. The assay was validated and used to test respiratory specimens obtained from children seen at a hospital in Seattle, Washington, from December 2002 through May 2003. RESULTS: The assay detected 1000 hMPV copies/mL of specimen, did not detect 19 other respiratory viruses, and was able to detect and accurately quantify isolates from the four known hMPV genetic lineages in a proficiency panel of 20 previously tested samples. hMPV was detected in 52 (7.2%) of 719 pediatric respiratory specimens. The mean log 10 copies/mL of hMPV in the 52 positive specimens was 7.67 (range = 4.59–10.60). Children aged 7–12 months had a significantly higher hMPV prevalence (12.4%) than did children younger than 7 months (4.7%) (P < 0.005). Children in this age group also had significantly higher levels of hMPV in their respiratory specimens (mean log 8.43 copies/mL) than did the younger children (mean log 6.93 copies/mL) (P = 0.0025). CONCLUSIONS: The rapid real-time RT-PCR assay described here is a sensitive test for clarifying the epidemiology of and diseases associated with hMPV.","Kuypers, Jane; Wright, Nancy; Corey, Lawrence; Morrow, Rhoda",J Clin Virol,670,27

Since the 2000s, however, the academic global health community has been moving toward a focus on health equity and reexamining the dynamics of global health education (GHE) partnerships. Whereas GHE partnerships have largely focused on providing opportunities for learners from HIC institutions, LMIC institutions are now seeking more equitable experiences for their trainees. Additionally, lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic underscore already important lessons about the value of bidirectional educational exchange, as regions gain new insights from one another regarding strategies to impact health outcomes. Interruptions in experiential GHE programs due to COVID-19-related travel restrictions provide an opportunity to reflect on existing GHE systems, to consider the opportunities and dynamics of these partnerships, and to redesign these systems for the equitable benefit of the various partners. In this commentary, the authors offer recommendations for beginning this process of change, with an emphasis on restructuring GHE relationships and addressing supremacist attitudes at both the systemic and individual levels.","Rabin, Tracy L.; Mayanja-Kizza, Harriet; Barry, Michele",Acad Med,670,16

METHODS: A web‐based questionnaire was sent to obstetricians and gynecologists in Japan via email and social media to collect voluntary responses. This survey was conducted from September 1 to 30, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 852 valid responses were included in the analysis; 76% (644) of the physicians felt that the COVID‐19 pandemic caused them physical and mental stress equal to or greater than the most severe disaster they had ever experienced. Physicians who reported high mental and physical stress were more likely to be in areas with high numbers of infected patients (odds ratio (OR) 1.571, p = 0.012). Physicians experienced great stress to the point of wearing heavy personal protective equipment during routine vaginal deliveries by mothers with no COVID‐19 symptoms. This trend was markedly pronounced for physicians working in regions with fewer cases of COVID‐19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Obstetricians and gynecologists who reported high mental and physical stress were more likely to be in areas with high numbers of infected patients. One potential reason for this may be that they were required to wear more personal protective equipment than necessary. Infection control methods that ensure the safety of obstetricians and gynecologists while not causing unnecessary physical or psychological stress are needed.","Umazume, Takeshi; Miyagi, Etsuko; Haruyama, Yasuo; Obata, Soichiro; Kobashi, Gen; Kurasawa, Kentaro; Suzuki, Yukio; Ikeda, Tomoaki; Kimura, Tadashi; Yamada, Hideto",J Obstet Gynaecol Res,670,28

Meanwhile,infectious diseases continue to threaten humanity. The analysis of Big Data, or vast digital data, presents an opportunity to improve disease surveillance and epidemic intelligence. Epidemic intelligence contains two components: indicator based and event-based. A relatively new surveillance type has emerged called event-based Internet biosurveillance systems. These systems use information on events impacting health from Internet sources, such as social media or news aggregates. These systems circumvent the limitations of traditional reporting systems by being inexpensive, transparent, and flexible. Yet, innovations and the functionality of these systems can change rapidly. AIM: To update the current state of knowledge on event-based Internet biosurveillance systems by identifying all systems, including current functionality, with hopes to aid decision makers with whether to incorporate new methods into comprehensive programmes of surveillance. METHODS: A systematic review was performed through PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, while also including grey literature and other publication types. RESULTS: 50 event-based Internet systems were identified, including an extraction of 15 attributes for each system, described in 99 articles. Each system uses different innovative technology and data sources to gather data, process, and disseminate data to detect infectious disease outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: The review emphasises the importance of using both formal and informal sources for timely and accurate infectious disease outbreak surveillance, cataloguing all event-based Internet biosurveillance systems. By doing so, future researchers will be able to use this review as a library for referencing systems, with hopes of learning, building, and expanding Internet-based surveillance systems. Event-based Internet biosurveillance should act as an extension of traditional systems, to be utilised as an additional, supplemental data source to have a more comprehensive estimate of disease burden.","O'Shea, Jesse",Int J Med Inform,670,3

However, this correlation among various age groups, such as young, middle-aged, and older people, as well as during the COVID-19 pandemic, has not been examined. This study examined the correlation between regular exercise and self-rated health and sleep quality among adults in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected using an online survey conducted between February 26 and 27, 2021. A total of 1410 adults in Japan (age range, 20–86 years) completed the online survey. Regular exercise was divided into: (1) more than 30 min of moderate exercise a day, (2) more than 2 days per week, and (3) continuous for 1 year or longer. Self-rated health and sleep quality were assessed using the Likert scale. After adjusting for multiple confounders, regular exercise was correlated with decreased poor self-rated health and poor sleep quality in middle-aged adults; however, no significant correlation was observed among young and older adults. The promotion of regular exercise among middle-aged people during the COVID-19 pandemic may contribute to better self-rated health and sleep quality status.","Makizako, Hyuma; Kiyama, Ryoji; Nishimoto, Daisaku; Nishio, Ikuko; Masumitsu, Tomomi; Ikeda, Yuriko; Hisamatsu, Misako; Shimizu, Sachiko; Mizuno, Masami; Wakamatsu, Mikiyo; Inoue, Naomi; Tabira, Takayuki; Ohshige, Tadasu; Yamashita, Ayako; Nagano, Satoshi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,670,1

This rapid systematic review examined the factors associated with psychological distress among HCW during an outbreak. Method: We systematically reviewed literature on the factors associated with psychological distress (demographic characteristics, occupational, social, psychological, and infection-related factors) in HCW during an outbreak (COVID-19, SARS, MERS, H1N1, H7N9, and Ebola). Four electronic databases were searched (2000 to 15 November 2020) for relevant peer-reviewed research according to a pre-registered protocol. A narrative synthesis was conducted to identify fixed, modifiable, and infection-related factors linked to distress and psychiatric morbidity. Results: From the 4,621 records identified, 138 with data from 143,246 HCW in 139 studies were included. All but two studies were cross-sectional. The majority of the studies were conducted during COVID-19 (k = 107, N = 34,334) and SARS (k = 21, N = 18,096). Consistent evidence indicated that being female, a nurse, experiencing stigma, maladaptive coping, having contact or risk of contact with infected patients, and experiencing quarantine, were risk factors for psychological distress among HCW. Personal and organizational social support, perceiving control, positive work attitudes, sufficient information about the outbreak and proper protection, training, and resources, were associated with less psychological distress. Conclusions: This review highlights the key factors to the identify HCW who are most at risk for psychological distress during an outbreak and modifying factors to reduce distress and improve resilience. Recommendations are that HCW at risk for increased distress receive early interventions and ongoing monitoring because there is evidence that HCW distress can persist for up to 3 years after an outbreak. Further research needs to track the associations of risk and resilience factors with distress over time and the extent to which certain factors are inter-related and contribute to sustained or transient distress.","Sirois, Fuschia M.; Owens, Janine",Front Psychiatry,670,30

The coronavirus (COVID‐19) pandemic of 2020 has influenced both Kalaallit Nunaat’s relations with the outside world and relations between people and places within the territory. The Kalaallit Nunaat government’s response to the pandemic, including both internal and external travel bans and restrictions on movement, has focused on eradicating the disease from the territory. This strategy, however, is challenged both by the SNIJ’s economic reliance on Denmark and by the Danish government’s own strategy of mitigating the disease.
