60348,60348,60348,Masses and malformations of the third ventricle: normal anatomic relationships and differential diagnoses.,9.73179,12.808873,2011,"OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to assess the extent and rate of vaginal tissue injury associated with the utilization of various monopolar electrosurgical power settings when laparoscopically transecting vaginal tissue. METHODS This is an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved prospective, paired, single-blinded study. Externalized porcine vagina was transected using monopolar energy at 30, 50, and 80 W in the cut mode with laparoscopic Endo Shears. The slides were prepared and stained with both hematoxylin-eosin and Masson trichrome and were examined by board-certified veterinary pathologists blinded to the study. RESULTS There were 18 swine; each animal was tested on all 3 power settings (n = 54). Tissue injury was measured to a mean (SD) of 767 (519) μm at 30 W, 690 (600) μm at 50 W, and 556 (470) μm at 80 W. When comparing the monopolar settings, the results were as follows: 30 versus 50 W (P = 0.33), 30 versus 80 W (P = 0.067), and 50 versus 80 W (P = 0.17). The mean (SD) time for complete transection was measured at each power setting (n = 18), with 35.8 (5.4) seconds for 30 W, 13.5 (5.5) seconds for 50 W, and 8.4 (5.1) seconds for 80 W (P < 0.001). There was a statistically significant difference in the mean (SD) rates of injury, with 20.8 (8.8) μm/s at 30 W, 39.8 (11.8) μm/s at 50 W, and 50.1 (19.2) μm/s at 80 W (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Using various power settings of monopolar energy may not make a significant difference in swine vaginal tissue damage at the time of colpotomy. However, there was a significant difference in the times and rates at which tissue was transected when using higher powers. We recommend using the 50- or 80-W setting, as this will likely decrease surgical times without altering vaginal tissue damage.","Iwanoff, Christopher J; Barbier, Heather M; Massengill, Jason C; Lombardini, Eric D; Christensen, Christine L; Buller, Jerome L; Gruber, Daniel D",Female pelvic medicine & reconstructive surgery,843,1

Its infection in humans can be fatal especially in patients with preexisting conditions due to smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Among the 25 proteins encoded by MERS-CoV, 5 accessory proteins seem to be involved in viral evasion of the host immune responses. Here we report that ORF4a, ORF4b, and ORF8b proteins, alone or in combination, effectively antagonize nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation. Interestingly, the inhibition of NF-κB by MERS-CoV accessory proteins was mostly at the level of a pattern recognition receptor: melanoma differentiationassociated gene 5 (MDA5). ORF4a and ORF4b additively inhibit MDA5-mediated activation of NF-κB while that of retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) is largely not perturbed. Of note, ORF8b was found to be a novel antagonist of MDA5-mediated NF-κB activation. In addition, ORF8b also strongly inhibits Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-mediated induction of NF-κB signaling. Taken together, MERS-CoV accessory proteins are involved in viral escape of NF-κB-mediated antiviral immune responses.","Lee, Jeong Yoon; Bae, Sojung; Myoung, Jinjong",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,843,24

While the cognitive and psychomotor domains were regularly taught in most medical schools, the affective domain was mostly left to informal teaching through role modelling. With the switch to online teaching, the dynamics of role modelling has changed, and the students do not observe their clinical teachers communicating with patients and colleagues. Therefore, the affective domain now needs to be taught more explicitly than ever to inculcate empathy, integrity, motivation, confidence, communication, time management, teamwork, advocacy, and respect. The five levels of affective domain namely; receiving, responding, valuing, organising and characterisation, can be taught to some extent. This paper describes the different strategies which can be utilised for online education for each level of the affective domain, and help students learn valuing emotions of others, that is an essential attribute required by a competent physician.

METHODS Subjects were ≥ 18 years old and underwent elective open, laparoscopic or RAS VIH repair without myofascial release. Perioperative clinical outcomes through 30 days were analyzed as were prescription pain medication use and subject-reported responses to the HerQLes Abdominal QOL questionnaire. Observed differences in baseline characteristics were controlled using a weighted propensity score analysis to obviate potential selection bias (inverse probability of treatment weighting, IPTW). A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Three hundred and seventy-one subjects (RAS, n = 159; open, n = 130; laparoscopic, n = 82) were enrolled in the study across 17 medical institutions within the United States. Operative times were significantly different between the RAS and laparoscopic groups (126.2 vs 57.2, respectively; p < 0.001). Mean length of stay was comparable for RAS vs laparoscopic (1.4 ± 1.0 vs 1.4 ± 1.1, respectively; p = 0.623) and differed for the RAS vs open groups (1.4 ± 1.0 vs 2.0 ± 1.9, respectively; p < 0.001). Conversion rates differed between RAS and laparoscopic groups (0.6% vs 4.9%; p = 0.004). The number of subjects reporting the need to take prescription pain medication through the 2-4 weeks visit differed between RAS vs open (65.2% vs 79.8%; p < 0.001) and RAS vs laparoscopic (65.2% vs 78.75%; p < 0.001). For those taking prescription pain medication, the mean number of pills taken was comparable for RAS vs open (23.3 vs 20.4; p = 0.079) and RAS vs laparoscopic (23.3 vs 23.3; p = 0.786). Times to return to normal activities and to work, complication rates and HerQLes QOL scores were comparable for the RAS vs open and RAS vs laparoscopic groups. The reoperation rate within 30 days post-procedure was comparable for RAS vs laparoscopic (0.6% vs 0%; p = 0.296) and differed for RAS vs open (0.6% vs 3.1%; p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS Short-term outcomes indicate that open, laparoscopic, and robotic-assisted approaches are effective surgical approaches to VIH repair; however, each repair technique may demonstrate advantages in terms of clinical outcomes. Observed differences in the RAS vs laparoscopic comparison are longer operative time and lower conversion rate in the RAS group. Observed differences in the RAS vs open comparison are shorter LOS and lower reoperation rate through 30 days in the RAS group. The operative time in the RAS vs open comparison is similar. The number of subjects requiring the use of prescription pain medication favored the RAS group in both comparisons; however, among subjects reporting a need for pain medication, there was no difference in the number of prescription pain medication pills taken. While the study adds to the body of evidence evaluating the open, laparoscopic, and RAS approaches, future controlled studies are needed to better understand pain and QOL outcomes related to incisional hernia repair.

We report a new technique where polyester mesh was back loaded through a 5-mm port site, coming into contact with the skin. This avoids the need for any 10-12-mm ports. METHODS A prospective database of laparoscopic ventral hernia repairs was examined. A single surgeon performed 344 laparoscopic ventral hernia repairs using this technique over 60 months. Follow-up was conducted by both clinical and independent phone review. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE Laparoscopic access was achieved via a 5-mm optical port, adding two, or occasionally three, 5-mm extra ports. Hernia contents were reduced and the extra-peritoneal fat excised; 5-mm tooth graspers were placed through the lateral port and then in a retrograde fashion through the uppermost port. The port was removed, and the mesh pulled back into the abdominal cavity and positioned with a minimum of 3-cm overlap. The mesh was fixed using absorbable tacks and sutures. RESULTS Most patients had primary umbilical hernias. There was one case of mesh infection due to enteric organisms. This occurred in a patient undergoing repair of a stoma site hernia, resulting from a Hartmann's procedure for perforated diverticulitis. There was no other evidence of acute or chronic mesh infection despite cutaneous contact with the mesh. In this series, there was an overall hernia recurrence rate of 2.4%. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair using only 5-mm ports is a safe, effective technique with no extra risk of infection.","Bell-Allen, Nicholas; O'Rourke, Harriet; Hong, Lisa; O'Rourke, Nicholas",ANZ journal of surgery,843,19

The pan-European curriculum for training in obstetrics and gynecology PACT (Project for Achieving Consensus in Training) incorporates medical simulation and recommends its urgent implementation in the national residency programs of individual countries. The current Covid-19 pandemic presents challenges to the medical community. During the first wave of the pandemic, Italy was the most severely affected EU country, whereas during the second wave Slovenia was among those most affected. The severe limitations of the lockdown and post-lockdown led to significant changes in all healthcare organizations and, consequently, also training activities in obstetrics and gynecology. Limitations on training during the Covid-19 pandemic may have severely impacted the opportunity to learn basic clinical and surgical skills. A potential strategy for overcoming these limitations was offered by simulation activities, which allowed trainees to receive basic training in our discipline and prevented an additional ""lockdown"" of their learning and development of skills. This type of simulation training will be of paramount importance, considering the paradigm shift caused by the Covid-19 pandemic in lifestyle and healthcare activities.Abbreviations: ACOG: American college of obstetricians and gynecologists; EBCOG: European board and college of obstetrics and gynaecology; ICU: intensive care unit; OR: operating room; PACT: project for achieving consensus in training; PUI: patient under investigation.","Lukanović, David; Laganà, Antonio Simone",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,843,33

This caused prolonged stay on board or at home for seafarers, who should be recognized as 'key' workers regarding their essential role in maintaining the flow of vital goods. OBJECTIVE Using a general inductive approach, this qualitative study aims to describe how the COVID-19 pandemic reflects on seafarers' well-being. The study focused on obtaining personal experiences from seafarers on board, and seafarers at home, relating to the current world pandemic. METHODS A convenience sample consisting of 752 seafarers from the international seafarers' population participated in an online study in spring 2020. The questionnaire used included questions relating to basic sociodemographic and work characteristics, and one open question which addressed seafarers' personal experiences. The data obtained was analysed by thematic analysis. RESULTS The emerged themes included mental, physical, social and economic well-being. Most of the answers of seafarers located on board related to threatened mental, physical and social well-being, while seafarers at home reported mostly on threats to their economic well-being. CONCLUSION Seafarers' well-being is seriously threatened by preventive measures relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results are discussed in relation to earlier findings in the area of occupational stress in seafaring. Overall, the data obtained portrays existing underlying occupational structures in the seafaring sector, which are rendered more visible due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In short, seafarers describe their reality as far away from the concept of 'key' or 'essential' workers.","Slišković, Ana",Work,843,28

It is currently one of the most recommended treatments for small- and medium-sized stones (<20 mm) in most guidelines internationally. The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak could lead to a further increase in ESWL use as it avoids a general anesthetic and its potential complications in patients with COVID-19 infection. Most publications exhibit ESWL stone-free rates (SFRs) of 70%-80%; however, this is often not the case in many centers, with multiple factors affecting the efficacy of the intervention. Various stone and patient factors have been shown to influence the ESWL success. Stone position, density and size, skin-to-stone distance, and body-mass index contribute to SFRs. Modifications in the lithotripter design and revisions in the technique have also improved the SFRs over the years, with slower shock rates, power-ramping protocols, combined real-time ultrasound, and fluoroscopy imaging technology, all enhancing the efficacy. The adjuvant use of pharmacological agents, such as alpha-blockers, potassium citrate, and the emerging microbubble technology, has also been investigated and shown promising results. Arguably, the most significant determinant of the success of ESWL in a particular unit is how the lithotripsy service is set up and monitored. Careful patient selection, dedicated personnel, and post-treatment imaging review are essential for the optimization of ESWL. Through an analysis of the published studies, this review aimed to explore the measures that contribute to an effectual lithotripsy service in depth.","Petrides, Neophytos; Ismail, Safiyah; Anjum, Faqar; Sriprasad, Seshadri",Turkish journal of urology,843,1

In this study, we applied theories from Bourdieu to address the question, ""How was a partial and partisan scientific account of SARS-CoV-2 transmission constructed and maintained, leading to widespread imposition of infection control policies which de-emphasised airborne transmission?"". METHODS From one international case study (the World Health Organisation) and four national ones (UK, Canada, USA and Japan), we selected a purposive sample of publicly available texts including scientific evidence summaries, guidelines, policy documents, public announcements, and social media postings. To analyse these, we applied Bourdieusian concepts of field, doxa, scientific capital, illusio, and game-playing. We explored in particular the links between scientific capital, vested interests, and policy influence. RESULTS Three fields-political, state (policy and regulatory), and scientific-were particularly relevant to our analysis. Political and policy actors at international, national, and regional level aligned-predominantly though not invariably-with medical scientific orthodoxy which promoted the droplet theory of transmission and considered aerosol transmission unproven or of doubtful relevance. This dominant scientific sub-field centred around the clinical discipline of infectious disease control, in which leading actors were hospital clinicians aligned with the evidence-based medicine movement. Aerosol scientists-typically, chemists, and engineers-representing the heterodoxy were systematically excluded from key decision-making networks and committees. Dominant discourses defined these scientists' ideas and methodologies as weak, their empirical findings as untrustworthy or insignificant, and their contributions to debate as unhelpful. CONCLUSION The hegemonic grip of medical infection control discourse remains strong. Exit from the pandemic depends on science and policy finding a way to renegotiate what Bourdieu called the 'rules of the scientific game'-what counts as evidence, quality, and rigour.","Greenhalgh, Trisha; Ozbilgin, Mustafa; Contandriopoulos, Damien",Wellcome open research,843,32

METHODS A retrospective cohort study was performed to examine the basic data, clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Wuhan Fourth Hospital from January 1st to February 1st in 2020. According to the diagnostic criteria of Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), patients with AKI were included in AKI group and those without AKI were included in non-AKI group. The differences of each index between the two groups were compared. The prognostic value of AKI for COVID-19 was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Cox regression. RESULTS A total of 394 COVID-19 patients were included, with a total mortality of 5.6%; 37 (9.4%) of them developed AKI. The mortality of patients with COVID-19 associated AKI was 18.9%. There were significant differences in age, gender, smoking history, hypertension history, malignancy history, cardiovascular disease history and cerebrovascular disease history between the two groups. In addition to the difference of serum creatinine (SCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count (NEU), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reaction protein (CRP) in AKI group were significantly higher than those in non-AKI group [WBC (×109/L): 5.75 (4.13, 7.83) vs. 4.52 (3.35, 5.90), NEU (×109/L): 4.55 (2.81, 6.11) vs. 3.06 (2.03, 4.50), AST (U/L): 40.0 (24.5, 69.5) vs. 30.0 (23.0, 42.5), LDH (μmol×s-1×L-1): 5.21 (3.68, 7.57) vs. 4.24 (3.05, 5.53), D-dimer (μg/L): 456 (266, 2 172) vs. 290 (152, 610), PCT (μg/L): 0.33 (0.03, 1.52) vs. 0.01 (0.01, 0.11), CRP (mg/L): 53.80 (26.00, 100.90) vs. 23.60 (9.25, 51.10), all P < 0.05], while lymphocyte count (LYM) and platelet count (PLT) were decreased [LYM (×109/L): 0.68 (0.47, 1.05) vs. 0.91 (0.63, 1.25), PLT (×109/L): 142.0 (118.0, 190.0) vs. 171.0 (130.0, 2 190.0), both P < 0.05]. The mortality of AKI group was significantly higher than that of non-AKI group [18.9% (7/37) vs. 4.2% (15/357), P < 0.01]. Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that the 30-day cumulative survival of AKI group was lower than that of non-AKI group (log-rank: P = 0.003). Cox analysis also showed that AKI increased the odds of patients with COVID-19 mortality by 3.2-fold [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.208, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.076-9.566, P = 0.037].

The aim is to analyze performance of different Italian Centers in North, Center and South, with a special eye for Lombardy (the Italian epicenter). PATIENTS AND METHODS During April 2020, a survey containing 14 multiple-choice questions focused on general staffing and surgical activity related to BC during the months of March 2019 and March 2020 was sent to 32 Italian Centers. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (v26) software. A Medline search was performed, in order to attempt a comparative analysis with published papers. RESULTS 28 Centers answered, for a response rate of 87.5%. Most of the urology staff in the Lombardy region were employed in COVID wards (p = 0.003), with a statistically significant reduction in the number of radical cystectomies (RC) performed during that time (p = 0.036). The total amount of RC across Italy remained the same between 2019 and 2020, however there was an increase in the number of surgeries performed in the Southern region. This was most likely due to travel restrictions limiting travel the North. The number of Trans-Urethral Resection of Bladder Tumors (TURBT) (p = 0.046) was higher in Academic Centers (AC) in 2020 (p = 0.037).

No study has been designed to focus exclusively on its application in the treatment of rectovaginal fistulas. The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of the clip for rectovaginal fistula repair. METHODS From September 2014 to November 2017, consecutive patients underwent a rectovaginal fistula repair using the over-the-scope clip proctology system and were enrolled in a non-randomized prospective monocentric study. The primary outcome was fistula healing at 8 months. Secondary outcomes included assessment of morbidity and timing of rectovaginal fistula recurrence. RESULTS There were 16 patients with a median age of 40.1 years. The most common causes of rectovaginal fistula were adverse events following proctectomy or pelvic radiotherapy (6 patients), obstetric trauma (5 patients) and inflammatory bowel disease (3 patients). Most participants had undergone at least two previous surgical interventions before the clipping procedure. 11 patients had a temporary diverting stoma at time of the clipping procedure. Successful primary healing of the fistula was observed in 7 (43.7%) patients. Short-term complications were rare and included pain, which occurred in 4 patients, and spontaneous clip detachment, which occurred in 2 patients. Most recurrences appeared shortly after the procedure, with a median delay of 45 days (range 16-217). CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and reproducibility of the Over-The-Scope Clip Proctology system in rectovaginal fistula repair for the patients selected. Further trials should be designed, incorporating comparisons to well-established techniques, a longer follow-up period, and a larger cohort.","Tong, Yiwei; Trilling, Bertrand; Sage, Pierre-Yves; Girard, Edouard; Faucheron, Jean-Luc",Techniques in coloproctology,843,1

Although disgust can defend effectively against pathogens encountered through ingestion or incidental contact, it offers limited protection against ectoparasites, which actively pursue a host and attach to its surface. Humans might, therefore, possess a distinct ectoparasite defence system-including cutaneous sensory mechanisms and grooming behaviours-functionally suited to guard the body's surface. In two US studies and one in China, participants (N = 1079) viewed a range of ectoparasite- and pathogen-relevant video stimuli and reported their feelings, physiological sensations, and behavioural motivations. Participants reported more surface-guarding responses towards ectoparasite stimuli than towards pathogen stimuli, and more ingestion/contamination-reduction responses towards pathogen stimuli than towards ectoparasite stimuli. Like other species, humans appear to possess evolved psychobehavioural ectoparasite defence mechanisms that are distinct from pathogen defence mechanisms.","Kupfer, Tom R; Fessler, Daniel M T; Wu, Bozhi; Hwang, Tiffany; Sparks, Adam Maxwell; Alas, Sonia; Samore, Theodore; Lal, Vedika; Sakhamuru, Tanvi P; Holbrook, Colin",Proceedings.

Also, functional imaging with DOTANOC-PET/CT may promise of greater accuracy in the detection or exclusion of recurrent/residual JNA. METHODS In this prospective study, five JNA patients who underwent a DOTANOC-PET-CT scan both preoperatively and postoperatively during June 2018-March 2020 were included. Postcontrast enhancement of a definite lesion was considered residual/recurrent tumor in contrast-enhanced MRI (CEMRI). In DOTANOC-PET/CT, any abnormal uptake apart from physiological sites was considered as residual lesions. Radiological results were categorized as negative, suspicious or definite residual/recurrent tumors. Any discrepancy was resolved by endoscopic biopsies. RESULTS Preoperatively all five cases of JNA showed avid DOTANOC expression in the tumor. The mean (SD) value of DOTANOC standardised uptake value in the tumor was 4.3 (1.4) (range = 2.1-6.2). In postoperative CEMRI evaluation, three of five patients had residual tumors and two had normal scans. On DOTANOC-PET/CT, two of five patients had residual tumors and three had normal scans. In one patient with residual tumor, the discrepancy with regard to tumor extent was noted in two scans, and further biopsy confirmed the findings of DOTANOC-PET/CT as accurate. CONCLUSION 68Ga-DOTANOC-PET/CT uptake is universal in JNA and appears to be more specific in the identification of residual/recurrent JNA. In residual tumors, DOTANOC-PET/CT may have an advantage over CEMRI in the diagnosis, decision making and planning stereotactic radiation. However, these findings are to be validated in studies with larger patients.","Thakar, Alok; Sakthivel, Pirabu; Arunraj, Sreedharan T; Bhalla, Ashu S; Prashanth, Arun; Kumar, Rakesh; Sharma, Suresh C",Nuclear medicine communications,843,29

Using this model, we compared recanalization success associated with different modern endovascular thrombectomy approaches. MATERIALS AND METHODS Model experiments were performed in 4 thrombectomy test groups: 1) primary or direct Stentriever thrombectomy with a conventional guide catheter (control group), 2) primary Stentriever thrombectomy with a balloon-guide catheter, 3) combined Stentriever-continuous aspiration approach, and 4) direct aspiration alone. Successful recanalization was defined as a TICI score of 2b or 3. RESULTS Seventy-one thrombectomy experiments were conducted. Similar rates of TICI 2b-3 scores were achieved with balloon-guide and conventional guide catheters (P = .34). The combined Stentriever plus aspiration approach and the primary aspiration thrombectomy resulted in significantly higher rates of TICI 2b or 3 than the conventional guide-catheter approach in the control group (P = .008 and P = .0001, respectively). The primary Stentriever thrombectomy with the conventional guide catheter showed the highest rate of embolization to new territories (53%). CONCLUSIONS Data from our in vitro model experiments show that the Stentriever thrombectomy under continuous aspiration and primary aspiration thrombectomy approaches led to the highest degree of recanalization.","Mokin, M; Setlur Nagesh, S V; Ionita, C N; Levy, E I; Siddiqui, A H",AJNR.

187750,187750,187750,Letter to the Editor: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in dromedary camels: are dromedary camels a reservoir for MERS-CoV?,10.256451,12.72831,2014,"Propagation and plaque assay of human coronavirus prototypes were studied in two human cell lines: a diploid fetal tonsil (FT) and a heteroploid rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cell lines. Plaques, observed within 2 to 3 days on FT cell monolayers with both 229E and OC43 viruses, appeared as colorless areas after staining with neutral red or crystal violet, whereas neutral red staining was required for visualization of plaques on RD cells. The plating efficiencies were approximately equal between the two cell lines, but virus assay by plaque formation was 15- to 30-fold more efficient than tube dilution assay with 50% endpoints. The discrepancy between 50% endpoint and plaque-forming unit values was striking and appeared to result from the fact that killing of cells (particularly RD cells) by coronaviruses was not accompanied by visible changes in the cells but killing was detected by the failure of infected cells to stain with a vital dye. The latent phase in one-step growth curves was 5 to 6 h for both viruses in either cell line, but the maximum yield of intracellular virus was reached in 18 to 20 h for FT cells and 24 to 28 h for RD cells. Virus release also differed between the two cell lines: in FT cells, the maximum yield of extracellular virus was reached 2 to 3 h later than that of intracellular virus, whereas in RD cells, the difference was 5 h for 229E virus and 10 h for OC43 virus. Although both cell lines appear equally useful for plaque assay, RD cells would be preferred for mass virus propagation because yields (5 X 10(8) plaque-forming units per ml) were 10-fold higher than in FT cells, a finding true for both virus prototypes.","Schmidt, O W; Cooney, M K; Kenny, G E",Journal of clinical microbiology,843,0

Australia has the fifth highest number of cases and the third highest rate of infection among the top five affected nations. People who are hospitalised with or die from this novel virus are more likely to have predisposing risk factors. There is a predilection for younger age groups and sparing of older age groups. This may be a property of influenza A viruses in general rather than being specific to swine influenza A. If unchecked, the sheer number of cases may lead to much higher numbers of deaths and hospitalised patients than would normally be attributed to a standard influenza season. Paradoxically, the low case-fatality rate of the virus raises the question of how best to approach management of this outbreak. It is uncertain how an expected vaccine against the novel virus will be used.","Senanayake, Sanjaya N",The Medical journal of Australia,843,1
