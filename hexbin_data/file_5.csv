5,5,5,Sequence requirements for RNA strand transfer during nidovirus discontinuous subgenomic RNA synthesis,9.590637,6.625474,2001-12-17,"Nidovirus subgenomic mRNAs contain a leader sequence derived from the 5′ end of the genome fused to different sequences (‘bodies’) derived from the 3′ end. Their generation involves a unique mechanism of discontinuous subgenomic RNA synthesis that resembles copy-choice RNA recombination. During this process, the nascent RNA strand is transferred from one site in the template to another, during either plus or minus strand synthesis, to yield subgenomic RNA molecules. Central to this process are transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs), which are present at both template sites and ensure the fidelity of strand transfer. Here we present results of a comprehensive co-variation mutagenesis study of equine arteritis virus TRSs, demonstrating that discontinuous RNA synthesis depends not only on base pairing between sense leader TRS and antisense body TRS, but also on the primary sequence of the body TRS. While the leader TRS merely plays a targeting role for strand transfer, the body TRS fulfils multiple functions. The sequences of mRNA leader–body junctions of TRS mutants strongly suggested that the discontinuous step occurs during minus strand synthesis.","Pasternak, Alexander O.; van den Born, Erwin; Spaan, Willy J.M.; Snijder, Eric J.",The EMBO Journal,5,1
30,30,30,Factors affecting translation at the programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting site of Cocksfoot mottle virus RNA in vivo,9.241587,6.303308,2005-04-20,"The ratio between proteins P27 and replicase of Cocksfoot mottle virus (CfMV) is regulated via a −1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (−1 PRF). A minimal frameshift signal with a slippery U UUA AAC heptamer and a downstream stem–loop structure was inserted into a dual reporter vector and directed −1 PRF with an efficiency of 14.4 ± 1.9% in yeast and 2.4 ± 0.7% in bacteria. P27-encoding CfMV sequence flanking the minimal frameshift signal caused ∼2-fold increase in the −1 PRF efficiencies both in yeast and in bacteria. In addition to the expected fusion proteins, termination products ending putatively at the frameshift site were found in yeast cells. We propose that the amount of premature translation termination from control mRNAs played a role in determining the calculated −1PRF efficiency. Co-expression of CfMV P27 with the dual reporter vector containing the minimal frameshift signal reduced the production of the downstream reporter, whereas replicase co-expression had no pronounced effect. This finding allows us to propose that CfMV protein P27 may influence translation at the frameshift site but the mechanism needs to be elucidated.","Mäkeläinen, Katri; Mäkinen, Kristiina",Nucleic Acids Res,5,28
134,134,134,The presence of the TAR RNA structure alters the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift efficiency of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by modifying the rate of translation initiation,9.722435,6.5880394,2007-11-05,"HIV-1 uses a programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift to synthesize the precursor of its enzymes, Gag-Pol. The frameshift efficiency that is critical for the virus replication, is controlled by an interaction between the ribosome and a specific structure on the viral mRNA, the frameshift stimulatory signal. The rate of cap-dependent translation initiation is known to be altered by the TAR RNA structure, present at the 5′ and 3′ end of all HIV-1 mRNAs. Depending upon its concentration, TAR activates or inhibits the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). We investigated here whether changes in translation initiation caused by TAR affect HIV-1 frameshift efficiency. CD4+ T cells and 293T cells were transfected with a dual-luciferase construct where the firefly luciferase expression depends upon the HIV-1 frameshift. Translation initiation was altered by adding TAR in cis or trans of the reporter mRNA. We show that HIV-1 frameshift efficiency correlates negatively with changes in the rate of translation initiation caused by TAR and mediated by PKR. A model is presented where changes in the rate of initiation affect the probability of frameshifting by altering the distance between elongating ribosomes on the mRNA, which influences the frequency of encounter between these ribosomes and the frameshift stimulatory signal.","Gendron, Karine; Charbonneau, Johanie; Dulude, Dominic; Heveker, Nikolaus; Ferbeyre, Gerardo; Brakier-Gingras, Léa",Nucleic Acids Res,5,11
244,244,244,VirHostNet: a knowledge base for the management and the analysis of proteome-wide virus–host interaction networks,9.474043,6.205883,2008-11-04,"Infectious diseases caused by viral agents kill millions of people every year. The improvement of prevention and treatment of viral infections and their associated diseases remains one of the main public health challenges. Towards this goal, deciphering virus–host molecular interactions opens new perspectives to understand the biology of infection and for the design of new antiviral strategies. Indeed, modelling of an infection network between viral and cellular proteins will provide a conceptual and analytic framework to efficiently formulate new biological hypothesis at the proteome scale and to rationalize drug discovery. Therefore, we present the first release of VirHostNet (Virus–Host Network), a public knowledge base specialized in the management and analysis of integrated virus–virus, virus–host and host–host interaction networks coupled to their functional annotations. VirHostNet integrates an extensive and original literature-curated dataset of virus–virus and virus–host interactions (2671 non-redundant interactions) representing more than 180 distinct viral species and one of the largest human interactome (10 672 proteins and 68 252 non-redundant interactions) reconstructed from publicly available data. The VirHostNet Web interface provides appropriate tools that allow efficient query and visualization of this infected cellular network.

These sequences are highly conserved among different serotype viruses based on sequence analysis. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-expressing plasmids (p3D-NT19, p3D-NT56, pVP4-NT19, pVP4-NT65 and p2B-NT25) were constructed to express siRNA targeting 3D, VP4 and 2B, respectively. The antiviral potential of these siRNA for various FMDV isolates was investigated in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells and suckling mice. The results show that these siRNA inhibited virus yield 10- to 300-fold for different FMDV isolates of serotype O and serotype Asia I at 48 h post infection in BHK-21 cells compared to control cells. In suckling mice, p3D-NT56 and p2B-NT25 delayed the death of mice. Twenty percent to 40% of the animals that received a single siRNA dose survived 5 days post infection with serotype O or serotype Asia I. We used an attenuated Salmonella choleraesuis (C500) vaccine strain, to carry the plasmid that expresses siRNA directed against the polymerase gene 3D (p3D-NT56) of FMDV. We used guinea pigs to evaluate the inhibitory effects of recombinant S. cho (p3D-NT56/S. cho) on FMDV infection. The results show that 80% of guinea pigs inoculated with 10(9) CFU of p3D-NT56/S. cho and challenged 36 h later with 50 ID(50) of homologous FMDV were protected. We also measured the antiviral activity of p3D-NT56/S. cho in swine. The results indicate that 100% of the animals treated with 5 × 10(9) CFU of p3D-NT56/S. cho were protected in 9 days.","Cong, Wei; Jin, Hong; Jiang, Chengda; Yan, Weiyao; Liu, Mingqiu; Chen, Jiulian; Zuo, Xiaoping; Zheng, Zhaoxin",Vet Res,5,28
755,755,755,Replication-Competent Recombinant Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) Viruses Expressing Indicator Proteins and Antiviral Cytokines,9.446256,6.5952444,2012-01-18,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) can subvert early innate immunity, which leads to ineffective antimicrobial responses. Overcoming immune subversion is critical for developing vaccines and other measures to control this devastating swine virus. The overall goal of this work was to enhance innate and adaptive immunity following vaccination through the expression of interferon (IFN) genes by the PRRSV genome. We have constructed a series of recombinant PRRS viruses using an infectious PRRSV cDNA clone (pCMV-P129). Coding regions of exogenous genes, which included Renilla luciferase (Rluc), green and red fluorescent proteins (GFP and DsRed, respectively) and several interferons (IFNs), were constructed and expressed through a unique subgenomic mRNA placed between ORF1b and ORF2 of the PRRSV infectious clone. The constructs, which expressed Rluc, GFP, DsRed, efficiently produced progeny viruses and mimicked the parental virus in both MARC-145 cells and porcine macrophages. In contrast, replication of IFN-expressing viruses was attenuated, similar to the level of replication observed after the addition of exogenous IFN. Furthermore, the IFN expressing viruses inhibited the replication of a second PRRS virus co-transfected or co-infected. Inhibition by the different IFN subtypes corresponded to their anti-PRRSV activity, i.e., IFNω5 ° IFNα1 > IFN-β > IFNδ3. In summary, the indicator-expressing viruses provided an efficient means for real-time monitoring of viral replication thus allowing high‑throughput elucidation of the role of host factors in PRRSV infection. This was shown when they were used to clearly demonstrate the involvement of tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) in the early stage of PRRSV infection. In addition, replication‑competent IFN-expressing viruses may be good candidates for development of modified live virus (MLV) vaccines, which are capable of reversing subverted innate immune responses and may induce more effective adaptive immunity against PRRSV infection.","Sang, Yongming; Shi, Jishu; Sang, Wenjing; Rowland, Raymond R.

784,784,784,Replication enhancer elements within the open reading frame of tick-borne encephalitis virus and their evolution within the Flavivirus genus,9.508585,6.4503727,2011-05-27,"We provide experimental evidence of a replication enhancer element (REE) within the capsid gene of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV, genus Flavivirus). Thermodynamic and phylogenetic analyses predicted that the REE folds as a long stable stem–loop (designated SL6), conserved among all tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV). Homologous sequences and potential base pairing were found in the corresponding regions of mosquito-borne flaviviruses, but not in more genetically distant flaviviruses. To investigate the role of SL6, nucleotide substitutions were introduced which changed a conserved hexanucleotide motif, the conformation of the terminal loop and the base-paired dsRNA stacking. Substitutions were made within a TBEV reverse genetic system and recovered mutants were compared for plaque morphology, single-step replication kinetics and cytopathic effect. The greatest phenotypic changes were observed in mutants with a destabilized stem. Point mutations in the conserved hexanucleotide motif of the terminal loop caused moderate virus attenuation. However, all mutants eventually reached the titre of wild-type virus late post-infection. Thus, although not essential for growth in tissue culture, the SL6 REE acts to up-regulate virus replication. We hypothesize that this modulatory role may be important for TBEV survival in nature, where the virus circulates by non-viraemic transmission between infected and non-infected ticks, during co-feeding on local rodents.","Tuplin, A.; Evans, D.

998,998,998,Diversity of Salmonella spp. serovars isolated from the intestines of water buffalo calves with gastroenteritis,9.422944,6.289465,2012-10-25,"BACKGROUND: Salmonellosis in water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) calves is a widespread disease characterized by severe gastrointestinal lesions, profuse diarrhea and severe dehydration, occasionally exhibiting a systemic course. Several Salmonella serovars seem to be able to infect water buffalo, but Salmonella isolates collected from this animal species have been poorly characterized. In the present study, the prevalence of Salmonella spp. in water buffalo calves affected by lethal gastroenteritis was assessed, and a polyphasic characterization of isolated strains of S. Typhimurium was performed. RESULTS: The microbiological analysis of the intestinal contents obtained from 248 water buffalo calves affected by lethal gastroenteritis exhibited a significant prevalence of Salmonella spp. (25%), characterized by different serovars, most frequently Typhimurium (21%), Muenster (11%), and Give (11%). The 13 S. Typhimurium isolates were all associated with enterocolitis characterized by severe damage of the intestine, and only sporadically isolated with another possible causative agent responsible for gastroenteritis, such as Cryptosporidium spp., Rotavirus or Clostridium perfringens. Other Salmonella isolates were mostly isolated from minor intestinal lesions, and often (78% of cases) isolated with other microorganisms, mainly toxinogenic Escherichia coli (35%), Cryptosporidium spp. (20%) and Rotavirus (10%). The S. Typhimurium strains were characterized by phage typing and further genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of 24 virulence genes. The isolates exhibited nine different phage types and 10 different genetic profiles. Three monophasic S. Typhimurium (B:4,12:i:-) isolates were also found and characterized, displaying three different phage types and three different virulotypes. The molecular characterization was extended to the 7 S. Muenster and 7 S. Give isolates collected, indicating the existence of different virulotypes also within these serovars. Three representative strains of S. Typhimurium were tested in vivo in a mouse model of mixed infection. The most pathogenic strain was characterized by a high number of virulence factors and the presence of the locus agfA, coding for a thin aggregative fimbria. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence that Salmonella is frequently associated with gastroenteritis in water buffalo calves, particularly S. Typhimurium. Moreover, the variety in the number and distribution of different virulence markers among the collected S. Typhimurium strains suggests that within this serovar there are different pathotypes potentially responsible for different clinical syndromes.","Borriello, Giorgia; Lucibelli, Maria G; Pesciaroli, Michele; Carullo, Maria R; Graziani, Caterina; Ammendola, Serena; Battistoni, Andrea; Ercolini, Danilo; Pasquali, Paolo; Galiero, Giorgio",BMC Vet Res,5,1

Here, we present the complete L-P1 sequences for eight serotype A and nine serotype O viruses recovered from FMDV outbreaks in East and West Africa over the last 33 years. Phylogenetic analysis of the P1 and capsid-coding regions revealed that the African isolates grouped according to serotype, and certain clusters were indicative of transboundary as well as intra-regional spread of the virus. However, similar analysis of the L region revealed random groupings of isolates from serotypes O and A. Comparisons between the phylogenetic trees derived from the structural coding regions and the L region pointed to a possibility of genetic recombination. The intertypic nucleotide and amino acid variation of all the isolates in this study supported results from previous studies where the externally located 1D was the most variable whilst the internally located 1A was the most conserved, which likely reflects the selective pressures on these proteins. Amino acids identified previously as important for FMDV structure and functioning were found to be highly conserved. The information gained from this study will contribute to the construction of structurally designed FMDV vaccines in Africa.

TGEV transmission can be prevented if local immunity is established with increased lymphocytes. The current parenteral mode of vaccination stimulates systemic immunity well, but it does not induce sufficient mucosal immunity. Retinoic acid (RA) plays an important role in the induction of cells that imprint gut-homing molecules. We examined whether RA assist parenteral vaccination of pigs could improve mucosal immunity. We demonstrated that elevated numbers of gut-homing CD8(+) T cells (which express α4β7 and CCR9 molecules) were presented in porcine inguinal lymph nodes and were recruited to the small intestine by RA. Intestinal mucosal immunity (IgA titre) and systemic immunity (serum IgG titre) were enhanced by RA. Therefore, we hypothesized that RA could induce DCs to form an immature mucosal phenotype and could recruit them to the small intestinal submucosa. Porcine T-cells expressed β7 integrin and CCR9 receptors and migrated to CCL25 by a mechanism that was dependent of activation by RA-pretreated DCs, rather than direct activation by RA. Together, our results provide powerful evidence that RA can assist whole inactivated TGEV (WI-TGEV) via subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization to generate intestinal immunity, and offer new vaccination strategies against TGEV.","Chen, Xiaojuan; Tu, Chongzhi; Qin, Tao; Zhu, Liqi; Yin, Yinyan; Yang, Qian",Sci Rep,5,28

Eighteen cattle (8 vaccinated with a recombinant FMDV A vaccine, 10 non-vaccinated) were challenged with FMDV A(24) Cruzeiro, and the gene expression profiles of nasopharyngeal tissues collected between 21 and 35 days after challenge were compared between 11 persistently infected carriers and 7 non-carriers. Carriers and non-carriers were further compared to 2 naïve animals that had been neither vaccinated nor challenged. At a controlled false-discovery rate of 10% and a minimum difference in expression of 50%, 648 genes were differentially expressed between FMDV carriers and non-carriers, and most (467) had higher expression in carriers. Among these, genes associated with cellular proliferation and the immune response–such as chemokines, cytokines and genes regulating T and B cells–were significantly overrepresented. Differential gene expression was significantly correlated between non-vaccinated and vaccinated animals (biological correlation +0.97), indicating a similar transcriptome profile across these groups. Genes related to prostaglandin E(2) production and the induction of regulatory T cells were overexpressed in carriers. In contrast, tissues from non-carrier animals expressed higher levels of complement regulators and pro-apoptotic genes that could promote virus clearance. Based on these findings, we propose a working hypothesis for FMDV persistence in nasopharyngeal tissues of cattle, in which the virus may be maintained by an impairment of apoptosis and the local suppression of cell-mediated antiviral immunity by inducible regulatory T cells.","Eschbaumer, Michael; Stenfeldt, Carolina; Smoliga, George R.; Pacheco, Juan M.; Rodriguez, Luis L.; Li, Robert W.; Zhu, James; Arzt, Jonathan",PLoS One,5,28

After 21 or 40 days of diabetes onset, mouse serums and tissues were analyzed for ACE and ACE2 enzyme activities and protein expression. ACE and ACE2 enzyme activities were detected in different tissues. Their expressions vary depending on the studied tissue. Thus, whereas ACE activity was highly expressed in lungs, ACE2 activity was highly expressed in pancreas among the studied tissues. Interestingly, we also observed that diabetes up-regulates ACE mainly in serum, lung, heart, and liver, and ACE2 mainly in serum, liver, and pancreas. In conclusion, we found a marked serum and pulmonary alteration in ACE activity of diabetic mice, suggesting a common regulation. The increase of ACE2 activity within the circulation in diabetic mice may be ascribed to a compensatory mechanism of RAS.","Roca-Ho, Heleia; Riera, Marta; Palau, Vanesa; Pascual, Julio; Soler, Maria Jose",Int J Mol Sci,5,1

We have used ribosome profiling to characterize viral translation in infected cells and map new translation initiation sites. We show here that EBV transcripts are translated with highly variable efficiency, owing to variable transcription and translation rates, variable ribosome recruitment to the leader region and coverage by monosomes versus polysomes. Some transcripts were hardly translated, others mainly carried monosomes, showed ribosome accumulation in leader regions and most likely represent non-coding RNAs. A similar process was visible for a subset of lytic genes including the key transactivators BZLF1 and BRLF1 in cells infected with weakly replicating EBV strains. This suggests that ribosome trapping, particularly in the leader region, represents a new checkpoint for the repression of lytic replication. We could identify 25 upstream open reading frames (uORFs) located upstream of coding transcripts that displayed 5′ leader ribosome trapping, six of which were located in the leader region shared by many latent transcripts. These uORFs repressed viral translation and are likely to play an important role in the regulation of EBV translation.","Bencun, Maja; Klinke, Olaf; Hotz-Wagenblatt, Agnes; Klaus, Severina; Tsai, Ming-Han; Poirey, Remy; Delecluse, Henri-Jacques",Nucleic Acids Res,5,28

Here, we expressed and purified RID from human LysRS (hRID) in Escherichia coli and performed a detailed mutagenesis of the appended domain. hRID was co-purified with nucleic acids during Ni-affinity purification, and cumulative mutations on critical amino acid residues abolished RNA binding. Furthermore, we identified a structural ensemble between disordered and helical structures in non-RNA-binding mutants and an equilibrium shift for wild-type into the helical conformation upon RNA binding. Since mutations that disrupted RNA binding led to an increase in non-functional soluble aggregates, a stabilized RNA-mediated structural transition of the N-terminal appended domain may have implications on the functional organization of human LysRS and multi-tRNA synthetase complexes in vivo.","Kwon, Soon Bin; Yu, Ji Eun; Park, Chan; Lee, Jiseop; Seong, Baik L.",Int J Mol Sci,5,11

We are interested in translation, which is one of the key steps of gene expression and viruses that have developed several strategies to hijack the ribosomal complex. The type 1 human immunodeficiency virus is a good paradigm to understand the great diversity of translational control. Indeed, scanning, leaky scanning, internal ribosome entry sites, and adenosine methylation are used by ribosomes to translate spliced and unspliced HIV-1 mRNAs, and some require specific cellular factors, such as the DDX3 helicase, that mediate mRNA export and translation. In addition, some viral and cellular proteins, including the HIV-1 Tat protein, also regulate protein synthesis through targeting the protein kinase PKR, which once activated, is able to phosphorylate the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2α, which results in the inhibition of cellular mRNAs translation. Finally, the infection alters the integrity of several cellular proteins, including initiation factors, that directly or indirectly regulates translation events.

How translation initiation factors regulate rotavirus infection remains poorly understood. In this study, the knockdown of the components of the eIF4F complex using shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 were performed, respectively. We have demonstrated that loss-of-function of the three components of eIF4F, including eIF4A, eIF4E and eIF4G, remarkably promotes the levels of rotavirus genomic RNA and viral protein VP4. Consistently, knockdown of the negative regulator of eIF4F and programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) inhibits the expression of viral mRNA and the VP4 protein. Mechanically, we confirmed that the silence of the eIF4F complex suppressed the protein level of IRF1 and IRF7 that exert potent antiviral effects against rotavirus infection. Thus, these results demonstrate that the eIF4F complex is an essential host factor restricting rotavirus replication, revealing new targets for the development of new antiviral strategies against rotavirus infection.","Chen, Sunrui; Feng, Cui; Fang, Yan; Zhou, Xinying; Xu, Lei; Wang, Wenshi; Kong, Xiangdong; P.

Curative therapy incorporates surgery and is burdensome with high rates of infection morbidity and mortality. The role of yeast as causative organisms of post-esophagectomy infections is poorly defined. Consequently, the benefits of specific antifungal prophylactic therapy in improving patient outcome are unclear. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating the incidence of yeast infections at the University Medical Center Groningen among 565 post-esophagectomy patients between 1991 and 2017. The results show that 7.3% of the patients developed a yeast infection after esophageal resection with significantly increased incidence among patients suffering from diabetes mellitus. For patients with yeast infections, higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, more frequent intensive care unit readmissions, prolonged hospital stays and higher mortality rates were observed. One-year survival was significantly lower for patients with a yeast infection, as well as diabetes mellitus and yeast-positive pleural effusion. We conclude that the incidence of yeast infections following esophagectomy is considerable, and that patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk. Furthermore, yeast infections are associated with higher complication rates and mortality. These observations encourage further prospective investigations on the possible benefits of antifungal prophylactic therapy for esophagectomy patients.","Heuker, Marjolein; Koser, Usma; Ott, Alewijn; Karrenbeld, Arend; van Dijl, Jan Maarten; van Dam, Gooitzen M.; de Smet, Anne Marie G.

About 25 per cent of the glycoprotein gC population demonstrated affinity for the lectin, compatible with presence of N-acetylgalactosamine as terminal sugar of the oligosaccharide. The HPA-binding populations of gC appeared as two electrophoretic bands with lower molecular weights than the non-binding gC. The gC subfraction without affinity for the HPA was subjected to treatments aiming to desialylize the carbohydrate moiety. Only 5 per cent of the initially non-reactive fraction of gC became reactive to HPA after the treatments, suggesting that masking of penultimate N-acetylgalactosamine by sialic acid was not a main reason for lack of HPA affinity. Results of treatment with alkaline Na BH(4) demonstrated presence of oligosaccharide-peptide linkages sensitive to β-elimination suggesting O-glycosidic type of linkage. The subfraction of gC demonstrating affinity for HPA as well as gC devoid of HPA binding capacity both revealed affinity for Con A. Therefore N-glycosidically as well as O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides seemed to be present on the one and same glycoprotein. On the basis of the results presented we assume that the glycosylation of HSV glycoprotein gC may lead to, at least, two populations of the glycoprotein gC, one with terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residues of oligosaccharides 0-glycosidically linked to the polypeptide and the other without affinity for HPA. However, both populations of gC contain similar proportions of oligosaccharides of the high mannose or complex types with N-glycosidic carbohydrate-peptide linkages as indicated by their affinity for Con A.","Olofsson, S.; Norrild, Bodil; Andersen, Åse B.; Pereira, Leonore; Jeansson, S.; Lycke, E.",Arch Virol,5,28

Competitive binding assays with these MAbs revealed the presence of at least seven distinct antigenic determinants (epitopes) on the G protein. In some cases, overlappings among epitopes to various degrees were observed as partial inhibition or binding enhancement. The MAbs to all the epitopes but one (epitopes 1–6) reacted with the denatured G protein in a Western immunoblot analysis. Four of the epitopes (epitopes 2, 4, 5, and 7) were involved in neutralization and two (epitopes 1 and 2) in hemagglutination inhibition. None of the MAbs inhibited the adsorption of radiolabeled VSV to BHK-21 cells; the MAbs to epitope 2 slightly enhanced the virus adsorption. All neutralization epitopes except epitope 2 (epitopes 4, 5, and 7) were associated with inhibition of VSV-mediated cell fusion. These results show a direct spatial relationship between the epitopes recognized by the MAbs and functional sites on G protein and further insights into the structure and function of G protein.","Nagata, S.; Okamoto, Y.; Inoue, T.; Ueno, Y.; Kurata, T.; Chiba, J.",Arch Virol,5,28

We identified two isolates of this strain in a diarrhea outbreak at a child care center in Houston, Texas; and two isolates in diarrhea stool samples from two children in Mexico City. All four isolates were detected in stool samples by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). One of the Mexican isolates was typed by EIA and all four isolates were HAstV-5 by typing RT-PCR. The four isolates were >97% nucleotide-identical in two different genomic regions: ORF1a (246nt), and the 3′ end of the genome (471nt). One isolate from each geographic location was further sequenced in the transition region from ORF1b to ORF2 (1255nt) and this region of the two isolates showed ≥ 99% nt identity. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences of eight HAstV antigenic types and the novel strain in the transition region demonstrated the new strain being closely related to HAstV-3 in ORF1b, but closest to HAstV-5 in ORF2. These results and high sequence identity among all HAstV antigenic types in the transition region and RNA structural predictions supported a potential recombination site at the ORF1b/ORF2 junction. This is the first evidence that recombination occurs among human astroviruses.","Walter, J. E.; Briggs, J.; Guerrero, M. L.; Matson, D. O.; Pickering, L.

With no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral treatments available to prevent dengue infection, dengue is considered a major public health problem in subtropical and tropical regions. The virus, like other enveloped viruses, uses the host’s cellular enzymes to synthesize its structural (C, E, and prM/M) and nonstructural proteins (NS1–5) and, subsequently, to glycosylate these proteins to produce complete and functional glycoproteins. The structural glycoproteins, specifically the E protein, are known to interact with the host’s carbohydrate receptors through the viral proteins’ N-glycosylation sites and thus mediate the viral invasion of cells. This review focuses on the involvement of dengue glycoproteins in the course of infection and the virus’ exploitation of the host’s glycans, especially the interactions between host receptors and carbohydrate moieties. We also discuss the recent developments in antiviral therapies that target these processes and interactions, focusing specifically on the use of carbohydrate-binding agents derived from plants, commonly known as lectins, to inhibit the progression of infection.","Idris, Fakhriedzwan; Muharram, Siti Hanna; Diah, Suwarni",Arch Virol,5,28

Three independent primary colonies gave rise to 3 finite cell lines, SST-1, -2, and -3, which were continuously cultured for 8 to 16 passages at 1:3 passage ratios over a period of 3 to 4 mo. The cells were passaged by pretreatment with Y27632 and dissociation with Accutase. The SST cells grew as tightly knit monolayers on top of the feeder cells at a slow rate (approximately 96 h doubling time) at a medium pH of approximately 6.9. Lipid vacuoles were visible by light microscopy in the cells particularly at the periphery of growth. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the cells to be a polarized epithelium with apical microvilli and to have lateral tight-junction-like unions and associated desmosomes.

7635,7635,7635,Lack of protection in vivo with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to transmissible gastroenteritis virus,9.222808,6.6002207,2002-11-13,"The antiviral activities of ribavirin (1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide; virazole), either alone or in combination with recombinant human leukocyte (alpha) interferon (rHuIFN-α), were evaluated against feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) in feline kidney-cell cultures. The 50% inhibitory dose (ID(50)) of ribavirin for uninfected, rapidly dividing cells was ∼17 μg ml(−1) whereas the ID(50) for FIPV was 2.5 μg ml(−1). The therapeutic index (TI) of ribavirin (i.e. the ratio of the minimum cell-toxic dose to minimum virus-inhibitory dose) was 6.8. Although a dose-dependent inhibition of viral infectivity occurred at non-toxic doses, maximum antiviral effects (⩾4 log(10) reduction in FIPV) occurred at cytotoxic doses. When low or moderate doses of ribavirin were combined with either 10 or 100 U of rHuIFN-α ml(−1), the resulting antiviral effects were significantly greater than the sum of the observed effects from either ribavirin or rHuIFN-α alone. Significant synergistic interactions with rHuIFN-α occurred at ribavirin doses of 1, 5, 12.5 and 25 μg ml(−1). Synergistic combinations of rHuIFN-α and ribavirin produced up to an 80-fold or a 200-fold relative increase in FIPV antiviral activities compared with that produced by equivalent doses, respectively, or ribavirin or rHuIFN-α alone. In cell growth studies, the addition of either 10 or 100 U of rHuIFN-α ml(−1) to test doses of ribavirin did not increase the anticellular effect observed with ribavirin alone; seemingly, the potentiation of ribavirin antiviral activity by rHuIFN-α was independent of any additive cytotoxic effects. Potentially, synergistic combinations of the two antiviral agents in vivo may decrease the therapeutic dose of ribavirin required for inhibition of FIPV and thus reduce drug toxicity.","Weiss, Richard C.; Oostrom-Ram, Theresia",Vet Microbiol,5,28

However, common metrics of malaria transmission such as parasite prevalence are under powered in elimination contexts. China has achieved major reductions in malaria incidence and is on track to eliminate, having reporting zero locally-acquired malaria cases in 2017 and 2018. Understanding the spatio-temporal pattern underlying this decline, especially the relationship between locally-acquired and imported cases, can inform efforts to maintain elimination and prevent re-emergence. This is particularly pertinent in Yunnan province, where the potential for local transmission is highest. Using a geo-located individual-level dataset of cases recorded in Yunnan province between 2011 and 2016, we introduce a novel Bayesian framework to model a latent diffusion process and estimate the joint likelihood of transmission between cases and the number of cases with unobserved sources of infection. This is used to estimate the case reproduction number, Rc. We use these estimates within spatio-temporal geostatistical models to map how transmission varied over time and space, estimate the timeline to elimination and the risk of resurgence. We estimate the mean Rc between 2011 and 2016 to be 0.171 (95% CI = 0.165, 0.178) for P. vivax cases and 0.089 (95% CI = 0.076, 0.103) for P. falciparum cases. From 2014 onwards, no cases were estimated to have a Rc value above one. An unobserved source of infection was estimated to be moderately likely (p>0.5) for 19/ 611 cases and high (p>0.8) for 2 cases, suggesting very high levels of case ascertainment. Our estimates suggest that, maintaining current intervention efforts, Yunnan is unlikely to experience sustained local transmission up to 2020. However, even with a mean of 0.005 projected up to 2020, locally-acquired cases are possible due to high levels of importation.","Routledge, Isobel; Lai, Shengjie; Battle, Katherine E.; Ghani, Azra C.; Gomez-Rodriguez, Manuel; Gustafson, Kyle B.; Mishra, Swapnil; Unwin, Juliette; Proctor, Joshua L.; Tatem, Andrew J.; Li, Zhongjie; Bhatt, Samir",PLoS Comput Biol,5,28

However, in the more slowly growing females of substrain A depression in body weight was observed after a single treatment with saline, whereas the body weight of oxytocin-treated females showed less marked depression and rapidly returned to the pretreatment weight. After a 3-day treatment period an even greater difference in daily weight gain was seen between oxytocin-treated and saline-treated female rats of substrain A. In contrast, no difference in daily weight gain or food intake was observed between oxytocin- and saline-treated male rats of substrain A, nor in females or males of the more rapidly growing substrain B. Intraperitoneal injections of 5 μg of oxytocin did not influence food intake or daily weight gain in female rats of substrain A. These data suggest that oxytocin may act centrally to influence food intake and daily weight gain in slowly growing female Sprague-Dawley rats.","Björkstrand, Eva; Uvnäs-Moberg, Kerstin",Physiol Behav,5,28

Here we report that self-administered intranasal interferon can be effective, and show how prophylaxis against rhinovirus infection is affected by both the quantity of interferon, and the interval between a dose and virus challenge. Finally, the medication regimen suggested for use in field trials (3.85 MU 3 times/day) was tested in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in volunteers. Although virus challenge was at a time when those being treated with interferon would be most susceptible, a substantial protective effect was still demonstrated.","Phillpotts, R.J.; Scott, G.M.; Higgins, P.G.; Wallace, J.; Tyrrell, D.A.J.; Gauci, C.L.",Antiviral Res,5,28

The immunomodulating activity was measured by increases in phagocytic activity and in nitric oxide production by peritoneal macrophages from mice treated with both free and LIP-IFN-γ (4000 U/mouse, intraperitoneal injection). Resident peritoneal macrophages harvested from mice treated with free unencapsulated IFN-γ or muramyl dipeptide showed significant increases in macrophage yield, and enhanced ability to phagocytize zymosan particles. In mice treated with liposome-encapsulated IFN-γ (LIP-IFN-γ), both macrophage yield and phagocytic activity further increased by 2-fold over unencapsulated IFN-γ. In addition, the activation of peritoneal macrophages with LIP-IFN-γ showed enhanced production of NO when the cells were cultured ex vivo. Using a murine respiratory influenza infection model, intranasally administered LIP-IFN-γ conferred protection to 70% in mice challenged intranasally with 10 LD(50) doses of influenza A/PR/8 virus compared with a 20% survival rate using free IFN-γ. Together these results suggest that liposome-encapsulation increases the immunomodulating and antiviral activities of IFN-γ. Liposome-encapsulation of IFN-γ may provide additional therapeutic advantages by reducing IFN-γ toxicity while prolonging its body retention.","Saravolac, E.G.; Kournikakis, B.; Gorton, L.; Wong, J.P.",Antiviral Res,5,28

However, prophylaxis was routinely used in early studies, and molecular diagnostic tools were not employed. The objective of this study was to review the incidence of PJP during and post‐FCR in the era of highly sensitive molecular diagnostics and (18)F‐fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)–computerised tomography (CT). METHODS: All patients treated with standard FCR at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (March 2009 to June 2012) were identified from a medications management database. Laboratory‐confirmed PJP cases during this time were identified from an electronic database. RESULTS: Overall, 66 patients were treated with a median of 5.5 FCR cycles. Eight PJP cases were identified, 6 of whom had received chemotherapy prior to FCR. In 5 cases, (18)F‐FDG PET demonstrated bilateral ground‐glass infiltrates. Median CD4(+) lymphocyte counts at time of PJP diagnosis and 9–12 months following FCR were 123 and 400 cells/μL, respectively. In patients receiving no prophylaxis, 9.1% developed PJP during FCR. The rate following FCR was 18.4%, with median onset at 6 months (2.4–24 months). CONCLUSION: Given the high rate of late‐onset PJP, consideration should be given for extended PJP prophylaxis for up to 12 months post‐FCR, particularly in pretreated patients. Further evaluation of the role of CD4(+) monitoring is warranted to quantify risk of disease development and to guide duration of prophylaxis.","Haeusler, Gabrielle M.; Slavin, Monica A.; Seymour, John F.; Lingaratnam, Senthil; Teh, Benjamin W.; Tam, Constantine S.; Thursky, Karin A.; Worth, Leon J.",Eur J Haematol,5,28

For the study new approaches to study vaccinia virus (VV), binding and entry based on confocal microscopy are developed. These techniques do not require virus purification or labeling and generate data that reveal the absolute numbers of virus particles that have bound to or have entered into individual cells. The chapter describes these techniques and then illustrates with some of the results obtained. These methods should be applicable to any virus larger than 50 nm. The chapter discusses the way these techniques have generated data that cannot be obtained with classical binding or entry assays. Vaccina virus is the prototype of the poxvirus family. These are DNA viruses that replicate in the cell cytoplasm and have genomes between 150 and 300 kbp. These techniques are presented with a study of the binding and entry of VV. The methods have been particularly useful for studying VV because this virus produces two different forms of infectious virion that are antigenically and biologically distinct and are produced in widely differing amounts. Moreover, the extracellular enveloped virus (EEV) form of VV cannot be purified from contaminating IMV without disrupting the integrity of the outer envelope.","Vanderplasschen, Alain; Smith, Geoffrey L.",Methods Enzymol,5,28

A systematic review and quantification of adherence and persistence with oral DMDs would help clarify the extent of nonadherence and nonpersistence in patients with MS to help prescribers make informed treatment plans and optimize patient care. The objectives were to: 1) conduct a systematic literature review to assess the availability and variability of oral DMD adherence and/or persistence rates across ‘real-world’ data sources; and 2) conduct meta-analyses of the rates of adherence and persistence for once- and twice-daily oral DMDs in patients with MS using real-world data. METHODS: A systematic review of studies published between January 2010 and April 2018 in the PubMed database was performed. Only studies assessing once- and twice-daily oral DMDs were available for inclusion in the analysis. Study quality was evaluated using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, a tool for assessing quality of observational studies. The random effects model evaluated pooled summary estimates of nonadherence. RESULTS: From 510 abstracts, 31 studies comprising 16,398 patients with MS treated with daily oral DMDs were included. Overall 1-year mean medication possession ratio (MPR; n = 4 studies) was 83.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 74.5–92.1%) and proportion of days covered (PDC; n = 4 studies) was 76.5% (95% CI 72.0–81.1%). Pooled 1-year MPR ≥80% adherence (n = 6) was 78.5% (95% CI 63.5–88.5%) and PDC ≥80% (n = 5 studies) was 71.8% (95% CI 59.1–81.9%). Pooled 1-year discontinuation (n = 20) was 25.4% (95% CI 21.6–29.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one in five patients with MS do not adhere to, and one in four discontinue, daily oral DMDs before 1 year. Opportunities to improve adherence and ultimately patient outcomes, such as patient education, medication support/reminders, simplified dosing regimens, and reducing administration or monitoring requirements, remain. Implementation of efforts to improve adherence are essential to improving care of patients with MS.","Nicholas, Jacqueline A.; Edwards, Natalie C.; Edwards, Roger A.; Dellarole, Anna; Grosso, Megan; Phillips, Amy L.",BMC Neurol,5,1

We performed the assessment of oxidative-antioxidant malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and total redox antioxidant potential (TRAP) indicators in seminal plasma, seminogram, clinical condition, and lifestyle of people with reproductive problems. The combined assessment of GSH and TRAP as potential biomarkers of male infertility in semen plasma was characterized by the highest total sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, we provide evidence that male reproductive potential is significantly correlated with basic sperm parameters, sperm cell membrane integrity, their morphology, lifestyle, eating habits, occupation, and mental health. Our results provide evidence on the importance of oxidative stress and defense against free radicals in diagnosing and monitoring men with infertility that are consistent with previously conducted research.

The gene was cloned in the pBAD vector and overexpressed at high levels in Escherichia coli. The purified enzyme was shown to be a soluble dimeric flavoprotein consisting of subunits of 50 kDa and contains non-covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide as a cofactor. From all substrates, the highest catalytic efficiency was found with putrescine (K (M) = 8.2 μM, k (cat) = 26 s(−1)). PuO(Rh) accepts longer polyamines, while short diamines and monoamines strongly inhibit activity. PuO(Rh) is a reasonably thermostable enzyme with t (1/2) at 50°C of 2 h. Based on the crystal structure of human monoamine oxidase B, we constructed a model structure of PuO(Rh), which hinted to a crucial role of Glu324 for substrate binding. Mutation of this residue resulted in a drastic drop (five orders of magnitude) in catalytic efficiency.

Micro, nano, microtopography, and oxide layer of dental implants influence tissue response. The lasers were used for achieving an implant surface with homogeneous micro texturing and uncontaminated surface. The present study aimed to characterize the implant surfaces treated by Nd: DPSS Q-sw Laser treatment compared to machined implants. A total of 10 machined implants and 10 lasered surface implants were evaluated in this study. The implant surfaces were evaluated by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), and metallography to characterize and measure the thickness of the oxide layer on the implant titanium surface. The machined surfaces showed a non-homogeneous oxide layer ranging between 20 and 30 nm. The lasered implant surfaces showed a homogeneous oxide layer ranging between 400 nm and 460 nm in the area of the laser holes, while outside the layer, thickness ranged between 200 nm and 400 nm without microcracks or evidence of damage. Another exciting result after this laser treatment is a topographically controlled, repeatable, homogeneous, and clean surface. This technique can obtain the implant surface without leaving residues of foreign substances on it. The study results indicate that the use of Nd: DPSS Q-sw laser produces a predictable and reproducible treatment able to improve the titanium oxide layer on the dental implant surface.","Scarano, Antonio; Postiglione, Francesca; Khater, Ahmad G.

OBJECTIVES: To characterize ventilatory (V(E)) responses to exercise following warm-up walking in individuals with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) during constant work rate (CWR) exercise. Secondarily, to investigate V(E) and tidal volume (V(T)) variability, and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) before and after overground locomotor training (OLT). SETTING: Research laboratory. METHODS: A 6-min CWR walking bout at preferred pace was used as a warm-up followed by 6 min of rest and a second 6-min CWR bout at above preferred walking pace. The second CWR bout was analyzed. Breath-by-breath ventilatory data were examined using a curvilinear least squares fitting procedure with a mono-exponential model. V(E) and V(T) variability was calculated as the difference between the observed and predicted values and RPE was taken every 2 min. RESULTS: Participants (n = 3, C4–C5) achieved a hyperpneic response to exercise in V(E) and V(T). OLT resulted in faster ventilatory kinetics and reductions of 24 and 29% for V(E) and V(T) variability, respectively. A 30% reduction in RPE was concurrent with the reductions in ventilatory variability. CONCLUSIONS: OLT may improve ventilatory control during CWR in patients with cervical motor-iSCI. These data suggest that in some participants with iSCI, ventilation may influence RPE during walking. Future research should investigate mechanisms of ventilatory variability and its implications in walking performance in patients with iSCI.","Panza, Gino S.; Herrick, Jeffrey E.; Chin, Lisa M.; Gollie, Jared M.; Collins, John P.; O’Connell, Dennis G.; Guccione, Andrew A.",Spinal Cord Series and Cases,5,28

Helminthic infections are associated with severe morbidity particularly in young children who often harbor the highest burden of disease. While each helminth species completes a distinct life cycle within the host, several helminths incite significant lung disease. This impact on the lungs occurs either directly from larval migration and host immune activation or indirectly from a systemic inflammatory immune response. The impact of helminths on the pulmonary immune response involves a sophisticated orchestration and activation of the host innate and adaptive immune cells. The consequences of activating pulmonary host immune responses are variable with several helminthic infections leading to severe, pulmonary compromise while others providing immune tolerance and protection against the development of pulmonary diseases. Further delineation of the convoluted interface between helminth infection and the pulmonary host immune responses is critical to the development of novel therapeutics that are critically needed to prevent the significant global morbidity caused by these parasites.","Weatherhead, Jill E.; Gazzinelli-Guimaraes, Pedro; Knight, John M.; Fujiwara, Ricardo; Hotez, Peter J.; Bottazzi, Maria Elena; Corry, David B.",Front Immunol,5,1

Pathogens like Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus, can quickly spread among producers. Biosecurity is designed to prevent infection transmission. When considering biosecurity investments, management must balance the cost of protection versus the consequences of contracting an infection. Thus, an examination of the decision making processes associated with investment in biosecurity is important for enhancing system wide biosecurity. Data gathered from experimental gaming simulations can provide insights into behavioral strategies and inform the development of decision support systems. We created an online digital experiment to simulate outbreak scenarios among swine production supply chains, where participants were tasked with making biosecurity investment decisions. In Experiment One, we quantified the risk associated with each participant’s decisions and delineated three dominant categories of risk attitudes: risk averse, risk tolerant, and opportunistic. Each risk class exhibited unique approaches in reaction to risk and disease information. We also tested how information uncertainty affects risk aversion, by varying the amount of visibility of the infection as well as the amount of biosecurity implemented across the system. We found evidence that more visibility in the number of infected sites increases risk averse behaviors, while more visibility in the amount of neighboring biosecurity increased risk taking behaviors. In Experiment Two, we were surprised to find no evidence for differences in behavior of livestock specialists compared to Amazon Mechanical Turk participants. Our findings provide support for using experimental gaming simulations to study how risk communication affects behavior, which can provide insights towards more effective messaging strategies.","Clark, Eric M.; Merrill, Scott C.; Trinity, Luke; Bucini, Gabriela; Cheney, Nicholas; Langle-Chimal, Ollin; Shrum, Trisha; Koliba, Christopher; Zia, Asim; Smith, Julia M.",PLoS One,5,1

The mechanisms by which these causes act on bumble bee colonies are, however, likely to be complex and to involve many levels of organization spanning from the community down to the least understood individual level. Here, we assessed how the morphology, weight and foraging behavior of individual workers are affected by their surrounding landscape. We hypothesized that colonies established in landscapes showing high cover of intensive crops and low cover of flowering crops, as well as low amounts of local floral resources, would produce smaller workers, which would perform fewer foraging trips and collect pollen loads less constant in species composition. We tested these predictions with 80 colonies of commercially reared Bombus impatiens Cresson placed in 20 landscapes spanning a gradient of agricultural intensification in southern Québec, Canada. We estimated weekly rate at which workers entered and exited colonies and captured eight workers per colony over a period of 14 weeks during the spring and summer of 2016. Captured workers had their wing, thorax, head, tibia, and dry weight measured, as well as their pollen load extracted and identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. We did not detect any effect of landscape habitat composition on worker morphology or body weight, but found that foraging activity decreased with intensive crops. Moreover, higher diversity of local floral resources led to lower pollen constancy in intensively cultivated landscapes. Finally, we found a negative correlation between the size of workers and the diversity of their pollen load. Our results provide additional evidence that conservation actions regarding pollinators in arable landscapes should be made at the landscape rather than at the farm level.","Gervais, Amélie; Courtois, Ève; Fournier, Valérie; Bélisle, Marc",PLoS One,5,1

First, what is the value or disvalue of a short life? Is it in the interests of a child to save her life if she will nevertheless die in infancy or very early childhood? Second, how does profound cognitive impairment affect the balance of positives and negatives in a child’s future life? Third, if the life of a child with life-limiting illness is prolonged, how much suffering will she experience and can any of it be alleviated? Is there a risk that negative experiences for such a child (suffering) will remain despite the provision of palliative care? We argue that both the subjective and objective components of well-being for children could be greatly reduced if they are anticipated to have a short life that is affected by profound cognitive impairment. This does not mean that their overall well-being will be negative, but rather that there may be a higher risk of negative overall well-being if they are expected to experience pain, discomfort, or distress. Furthermore, we point to some of the practical limitations of therapies aimed at relieving suffering, such that there is a risk that suffering will go partially or completely unrelieved. Taken together, these considerations imply that some life-prolonging treatments are not in the best interests of infants with severe life-limiting illness.","Wilkinson, Dominic; Zayegh, Amir",Theor Med Bioeth,5,28

Targeting myocardial fibrosis (MF) has become a major therapeutic goal in order to prevent the occurrence of DDC. We aimed to review and summarize the current evidence about the role of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) in the development and perpetuation of MF in DCC. We conducted a comprehensive search of peer-reviewed English literature on PubMed about this subject. We found increasing preclinical evidence from studies in animal models during the last 20 years pointing out a central role of RAAS in the development of MF in DDC. Local tissue RAAS acts directly mainly through its main fibrotic component angiotensin II (ANG2) and its transducer receptor (AT1R) and downstream TGF-b pathway. Additionally, it modulates the actions of most of the remaining pro-fibrotic factors involved in DDC. Despite limited clinical evidence, RAAS blockade constitutes the most studied, available and promising therapeutic strategy against MF and DDC. Conclusion: Based on the evidence reviewed, it would be recommendable to start RAAS blockade therapy through angiotensin converter enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or AT1R blockers (ARBs) alone or in combination with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRa) at the youngest age after the diagnosis of dystrophinopathies, in order to delay the occurrence or slow the progression of MF, even before the detection of any cardiovascular alteration.","Rodriguez-Gonzalez, Moises; Lubian-Gutierrez, Manuel; Cascales-Poyatos, Helena Maria; Perez-Reviriego, Alvaro Antonio; Castellano-Martinez, Ana",Int J Mol Sci,5,1

However, it is time consuming and labor intensive for the clinician to manually search the recorded long video image frame by frame to identify the instantaneous swallowing abnormality in VFSS images. Therefore, this study aims to present a deep leaning-based approach using transfer learning with a convolutional neural network (CNN) that automatically annotates pharyngeal phase frames in untrimmed VFSS videos such that frames need not be searched manually. Methods: To determine whether the image frame in the VFSS video is in the pharyngeal phase, a single-frame baseline architecture based the deep CNN framework is used and a transfer learning technique with fine-tuning is applied. Results: Compared with all experimental CNN models, that fine-tuned with two blocks of the VGG-16 (VGG16-FT5) model achieved the highest performance in terms of recognizing the frame of pharyngeal phase, that is, the accuracy of 93.20 (±1.25)%, sensitivity of 84.57 (±5.19)%, specificity of 94.36 (±1.21)%, AUC of 0.8947 (±0.0269) and Kappa of 0.7093 (±0.0488). Conclusions: Using appropriate and fine-tuning techniques and explainable deep learning techniques such as grad CAM, this study shows that the proposed single-frame-baseline-architecture-based deep CNN framework can yield high performances in the full automation of VFSS video analysis.","Lee, Ki-Sun; Lee, Eunyoung; Choi, Bareun; Pyun, Sung-Bom",Diagnostics (Basel),5,28

Its expression is upregulated by stimulation from microbes or inflammation. Genetic polymorphisms in the HBD-1 gene have been implicated in the development of various smoking-related diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. Thus, we sought to analyze possible associations between HBD-1 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in HBD-1 gene and CS in ethnic Saudi Arabian subjects. Variants rs1047031 (C/T), rs1799946 (C/T), rs2738047 (C/T), and rs11362 (C/T) were investigated by genotyping 575 blood specimens from males and females, smokers/non-smokers: 288/287. The CT and CT+TT genotypes of rs1799946 presented an ~5-fold increased correlation with CS among the female smokers, compared with the female controls (OR = 5.473, P = 0.02003; and OR = 5.211, P = 0.02028, respectively), an observation similar to rs11362 SNP in female smokers, but with protective effects in TT genotype, compared with the CC reference allele (OR = 0.143, P = 0.04368). In shisha smokers, the heterozygous CT and the CT/TT genotype of rs2738047 polymorphism showed the same results with ~3-fold increased correlation with CS (OR = 2.788; P = 0.03448), compared with the cigarette smokers category. No significant association was shown in genotypic distributions and allelic frequencies of rs1047031. Further investigations, including large study samples, are required to investigate the effects of shisha on human beta-defensin expression and protein levels.","Almutairi, Mikhlid; Almutairi, Bader; Almutairi, Mohammad; Parine, Narasimha Reddy; Alrefaei, Abdulwahed; Alanazi, Mohammad; Semlali, Abdelhabib",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,5,28

The pathogenesis of RA involves multiple pathways, resulting in some patients showing resistance to the existing drugs. Salubrinal is a small molecule compound that has recently been shown to exert multiple beneficial effects on bone tissue. However, the effect of Salubrinal in RA has not been clearly confirmed. Hence, we induced collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1J mice and found that Salubrinal treatment decreased the clinical score of CIA mice, inhibiting joint damage and bone destruction. Furthermore, Salubrinal treatment downregulated osteoclast number in knee joint of CIA in mice, and suppressed bone marrow-derived osteoclast formation and function, downregulated osteoclast-related gene expression. Moreover, Salubrinal treatment inhibited RANKL-induced NF-κB signaling pathway, and promoted P65 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, further restrained RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. This study explains the mechanism by which Salubrinal ameliorates arthritis of CIA in mice, indicating that Salubrinal may be a potential drug for RA, and expands the potential uses of Salubrinal in the treatment of bone destruction-related diseases.","Wang, Ziyu; Li, Zijian; Wang, Guojue; Sun, Ying; Yuan, Yuanyang; Nie, Hong",Int J Mol Sci,5,1

Intensely stressful events and their memories change rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in animal models. REM sleep varies with individual differences of stress resilience or vulnerability. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a primary mediator of the effects of stress and fear memories on sleep. However, the molecular mechanisms in BLA regulating the effects of fear conditioning, shock training (ST) and context re-exposure (CTX) on REM sleep are not well known. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs and posttranscriptional gene regulators of diverse biological processes. The aim of this study is to investigate ST- and CTX-altered miRNAs in the BLA of resilience and vulnerable animals and on REM sleep regulation. MiRNAs expression profiles in BLA were generated following ST and CTX using the Taqman Low Density rodent microRNA array. The altered BLA miRNAs expression and REM sleep reduction observed in ST and CTX vulnerable animals. AntagomiR-221 microinjection into BLA for one of the upregulated miRNAs, miR-221 in BLA, attenuated the REM sleep reduction. This study suggests that miRNAs in the BLA may play a significant role in mediating the effects of stress and fear memories on REM sleep.","Balakathiresan, Nagaraja S.; Bhomia, Manish; Zhai, Min; Sweeten, Brook L.

Obesity is currently presented as a pro-inflammatory state with an expansion in the outflow of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), alongside the expanded emission of leptin. The present review aimed to evaluate the relationship between obesity and inflammation and their impacts on the development of cardiovascular disease. A literature search was conducted by employing three academic databases, namely PubMed (Medline), Scopus (EMBASE), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). The search presented 786 items, and by inclusion and exclusion filterers, 59 works were considered for final review. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) method was adopted to conduct quality assessment; 19 papers were further selected based on the quality score. Obesity-related inflammation leads to a low-grade inflammatory state in organisms by upregulating pro-inflammatory markers and downregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines, thereby contributing to cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. Because of inflammatory and infectious symptoms, adipocytes appear to instigate articulation and discharge a few intense stage reactants and carriers of inflammation. Obesity and inflammatory markers are strongly associated, and are important factors in the development of CVD. Hence, weight management can help prevent cardiovascular risks and poor outcomes by inhibiting inflammatory mechanisms.","Battineni, Gopi; Sagaro, Getu Gamo; Chintalapudi, Nalini; Amenta, Francesco; Tomassoni, Daniele; Tayebati, Seyed Khosrow",Int J Mol Sci,5,1

The synthesized homologous series constitutes four members that differ from each other in the terminal length of flexible chain (n) attached to phenyl ester moiety, which varies between n = 6, 8, 10, and 12 carbons. A lateral CH(3)O group is attached to the central benzene ring in the meta position with respect to the ester moiety. Molecular structures of all newly prepared homologues were elucidated via FT-IR, (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy. Mesomorphic and thermal properties were examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the mesophases identified by polarized optical microscopy (POM). DSC and POM examinations revealed that all members of the present series (An) exhibit a purely enantiotropic nematic (N) phase. Comparative evaluations and binary phase diagrams were established between the present homologues and their corresponding shorter one (Bn). The examination revealed that, the length of the flexible alkoxy chain incorporated into the phenylimino moiety is highly effective on the temperature range and stability of the mesophase observed. With respect to the binary mixtures An/Bn, the exhibited N phase showed to cover the whole composition range with eutectic behavior.","Altowyan, Abeer S.; Ahmed, Hoda A.; Gomha, Sobhi M.; Mostafa, Ayman M.",Polymers (Basel),5,1

Metabolic disorders including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may stimulate amyloid β (Aβ) aggregate formation. AD, obesity, and T2DM share similar features such as chronic inflammation, increased oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and impaired energy metabolism. Adiposity is associated with the pro-inflammatory phenotype. Adiposity-related inflammatory factors lead to the formation of inflammasome complexes, which are responsible for the activation, maturation, and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18). Activation of the inflammasome complex, particularly NLRP3, has a crucial role in obesity-induced inflammation, insulin resistance, and T2DM. The abnormal activation of the NLRP3 signaling pathway influences neuroinflammatory processes. NLRP3/IL-1β signaling could underlie the association between adiposity and cognitive impairment in humans. The review includes a broadened approach to the role of obesity-related diseases (obesity, low-grade chronic inflammation, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and enhanced NLRP3 activity) in AD. Moreover, we also discuss the mechanisms by which the NLRP3 activation potentially links inflammation, peripheral and central insulin resistance, and metabolic changes with AD.","Litwiniuk, Anna; Bik, Wojciech; Kalisz, Małgorzata; Baranowska-Bik, Agnieszka",Int J Mol Sci,5,1

While the evolution of allometry has attracted much attention for centuries, our understanding of the developmental genetic mechanisms underlying its emergence remains fragmented. Here we conduct comparative transcriptomics of the legs followed by an RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify genes that play a role in the hyperallometric growth of the third legs in the males of the water strider Microvelia longipes. We demonstrate that a broadly expressed growth factor, Bone Morphogenetic Protein 11 (BMP11, also known as Growth Differentiation Factor 11), regulates leg allometries through increasing the allometric slope and mean body size in males. In contrast, BMP11 RNAi reduced mean body size but did not affect slope either in the females of M. longipes or in the males and females of other closely related Microvelia species. Furthermore, our data show that a tissue-specific factor, Ultrabithorax (Ubx), increases intercept without affecting mean body size. This indicates a genetic correlation between mean body size and variation in allometric slope, but not intercept. Strikingly, males treated with BMP11 RNAi exhibited a severe reduction in fighting frequency compared to both controls and Ubx RNAi-treated males. Therefore, male body size, the exaggerated weapon, and the intense fighting behavior associated with it are genetically correlated in M. longipes. Our results support a possible role of pleiotropy in the evolution of allometric slope.","Toubiana, William; Armisén, David; Viala, Séverine; Decaras, Amélie; Khila, Abderrahman",PLoS Biol,5,1

It is therefore considered a potential target for cancer treatment. However, a chemical compound that directly regulates PGRMC1 has not been identified. Here, we showed that the natural active compound in licorice, glycyrrhizin (GL), directly binds to heme-dimerized PGRMC1 to inhibit PGRMC1-mediated EGF receptor (EGFR) activation in cancer cells. Chemical screening using GL derivatives revealed that the glucoside derivative glucoglycyrrhizin (GlucoGL) binds more potently to PGRMC1 and contributes to the suppression of PGRMC1-mediated cancer chemoresistance. This study provides the first evidence of chemical compounds that directly bind to PGRMC1 to inhibit its function, and the findings provide new insights for cancer treatments that target PGRMC1. ABSTRACT: Progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) is highly expressed in various cancer cells and contributes to tumor progression. We have previously shown that PGRMC1 forms a unique heme-stacking functional dimer to enhance EGF receptor (EGFR) activity required for cancer proliferation and chemoresistance, and the dimer dissociates by carbon monoxide to attenuate its biological actions. Here, we determined that glycyrrhizin (GL), which is conventionally used to ameliorate inflammation, specifically binds to heme-dimerized PGRMC1. Binding analyses using isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that some GL derivatives, including its glucoside-derivative (GlucoGL), bind to PGRMC1 potently, whereas its aglycone, glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), does not bind. GL and GlucoGL inhibit the interaction between PGRMC1 and EGFR, thereby suppressing EGFR-mediated signaling required for cancer progression. GL and GlucoGL significantly enhanced EGFR inhibitor erlotinib- or cisplatin (CDDP)-induced cell death in human colon cancer HCT116 cells. In addition, GL derivatives suppressed the intracellular uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by inhibiting the interaction between PGRMC1 and the LDL receptor (LDLR). Effects on other pathways cannot be excluded. Treatment with GlucoGL and CDDP significantly suppressed tumor growth following xenograft transplantation in mice. Collectively, this study indicates that GL derivatives are novel inhibitors of PGRMC1 that suppress cancer progression, and our findings provide new insights for cancer treatment.","Kabe, Yasuaki; Koike, Ikko; Yamamoto, Tatsuya; Hirai, Miwa; Kanai, Ayaka; Furuhata, Ryogo; Tsugawa, Hitoshi; Harada, Erisa; Sugase, Kenji; Hanadate, Kazue; Yoshikawa, Nobuji; Hayashi, Hiroaki; Noda, Masanori; Uchiyama, Susumu; Yamazaki, Hiroki; Tanaka, Hirotoshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Handa, Hiroshi; Suematsu, Makoto",Cancers (Basel),5,8

However, when considered through the looking glass of intrinsic disorder (ID), these apparent oddities seem quite expected. Keratinocyte proteins with highly repetitive motifs are of low complexity but high adaptation, providing polymers (e.g., profilaggrin) for proteolysis into bioactive derivatives, or monomers (e.g., loricrin) repeatedly cross-linked to self and other proteins to shield underlying tissue. Keratohyalin granules developing from liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) show that unique biomolecular condensates (BMC) and proteinaceous membraneless organelles (PMLO) occur in these highly customized cells. We conducted bioinformatic and in silico assessments of representative keratinocyte differentiation-dependent proteins. This was conducted in the context of them having demonstrated potential ID with the prospect of that characteristic driving formation of distinctive keratinocyte structures. Intriguingly, while ID is characteristic of many of these proteins, it does not appear to guarantee LLPS, nor is it required for incorporation into certain keratinocyte protein condensates. Further examination of keratinocyte-specific proteins will provide variations in the theme of PMLO, possibly recognizing new BMC for advancements in understanding intrinsically disordered proteins as reflected by keratinocyte biology.","Shamilov, Rambon; Robinson, Victoria L.; Aneskievich, Brian J.",Int J Mol Sci,5,8

In china, the incidence of brucellosis is increasing each year, seriously threatening the health of humans as well as animal populations. Despite a quite number of diagnostic methods currently being used for brucellosis, innovative technologies are still needed for its rapid and accurate diagnosis, especially in area where traditional diagnostic is unavailable. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, a total of 22 B cell linear epitopes were predicted from five Brucella outer membrane proteins (OMPs) using an immunoinformatic approach. These epitopes were then chemically synthesized, and with the method of indirect ELISA (iELISA), each of them displayed a certain degree of capability in identifying human brucellosis positive sera. Subsequently, a fusion protein consisting of the 22 predicted epitopes was prokaryotically expressed and used as diagnostic antigen in a newly established brucellosis testing method, nano-ZnO modified paper-based ELISA (nano-p-ELISA). According to the verifying test using a collection of sera collected from brucellosis and non-brucellosis patients, the sensitivity and specificity of multiepitope based nano-p-ELISA were 92.38% and 98.35% respectively. The positive predictive value was 98.26% and the negative predictive value was 91.67%. The multiepitope based fusion protein also displayed significantly higher specificity than Brucella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen. CONCLUSIONS: B cell epitopes are important candidates for serologically testing brucellosis. Multiepitope fusion protein based nano-p-ELISA displayed significantly sensitivity and specificity compared to Brucella LPS antigen. The strategy applied in this study will be helpful to develop rapid and accurate diagnostic method for brucellosis in human as well as animal populations.","Yin, Dehui; Bai, Qiongqiong; Wu, Xiling; Li, Han; Shao, Jihong; Sun, Mingjun; Jiang, Hai; Zhang, Jingpeng",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,5,11

This risk is significantly increased by different factors including unintended or unplanned pregnancy (aOR: 1.33, 1.14–1.56 CI95%), being separated or single (aOR: 1.34, 1.12–1.60 CI95%), experiencing depression and anxiety before childbirth (aOR: 1.50, 1.02–2.27 CI95%), abortion experience (aOR: 2.60, 1.03–7.14 CI95%) and domestic violence (aOR: 1.76, 1.12–2.83 CI95%). Conclusion: The results of this study reveal a high prevalence of depressive disorder symptoms within the study population. These findings highlight the need to develop maternal care programs to support both mothers and their infants.","Nicolet, Laure; Moayedoddin, Amir; Miafo, Joel Djatché; Nzebou, Daniel; Stoll, Beat; Jeannot, Emilien",J Clin Med,5,1

The rate of loss of biodiversity is accelerating because increasing pressure from an expanding human population is shrinking natural habitat and over-exploiting wild animal populations. Although processes such as habitat loss and over-harvesting are usually identified as the major drivers of extinction, recent evidence suggests that disease can also be a significant threat to endangered species (Lyles and Dobson 1993; Daszak and Cunningham 1999; Daszak et al. 2000b; de Castro and Bolker 2004; Choisy and Rohani 2006; Lips et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2006). Disease has already been documented as a cause of extinction of a land snail (Partula turgida) (Cunningham and Dazsak 1998), and several amphibian species (Schloegel et al. 2006; Skerrat et al. 2007). Diseases are also known to cause significant population declines, as illustrated by the impact of canine distemper virus in black-footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes) (Williams et al. 1988) and lions (Panthera leo) (Roelke-Parker et al. 1996), rabies virus in African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) (Woodroffe and Ginsberg 1999), Ebola virus in apes (Leroy et al. 2004), squirrelpox virus in red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) (Rushton et al. 2006) and transmissible facial tumour disease in Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) (Pearse and Swift 2006).","Breed, Andrew C.; Plowright, Raina K.; Hayman, David T.

Yersinia enterocolitica, resistant to human serum, expresses several factors that may contribute to this resistance, the outer membrane proteins YadA and Ail, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To study relative roles of these factors for the survival of Y. enterocolitica serotype, O:3 (Ye O:3) in nonimmune human serum, we constructed 23 mutant strains of Ye O:3 expressing different combinations of YadA, Ail, LPS O‐antigen and LPS outer core. Survival of bacteria was analysed in normal serum (with functional classical and alternative complement activation pathways) and EGTA‐Mg‐treated serum (only alternative pathway functional). Kinetic killing tests revealed that the most potent single serum resistance factor needed for long‐term survival was YadA. Ail was important for short‐term survival and thus delayed the bacterial killing. On the contrary, the LPS O‐antigen and outer core when in combination with YadA or Ail, or both, had a minor and often negative effect on serum resistance.","Biedzka‐Sarek, M.; Venho, R.; Skurnik, M.",Scand J Immunol,5,28

Contrary to this, another RAS component, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) catalyzes synthesis of Ang II from angiotensin I (Ang I) that functions as active compound in blood pressure regulation. This indicates importance of ACE/ACE2 level in regulating blood pressure by targeting Ang II. An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) highlighted the additional role of ACE2 as a receptor for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Activation of spike (S)-protein by either type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) or cathepsin-mediated cleavage initiates receptor binding and viral entry. In addition to TTSPs, ACE2 can also be trimmed by ADAM 17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17) that competes for the same receptor. Cleavage by TTSPs activates ACE2 receptor for binding, whereas ADAM17 releases extracellular fragment called soluble ACE2 (sACE2). Structural studies of both ACE2 and S-protein have found critical sites involved in binding mechanism. In addition to studies on structural motifs, few single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) studies have been done to find an association between genetic variants and SARS susceptibility. Though no association was found in those reports, but seeing the non-reproducibility of SNP studies among different ethnic groups, screening of ACE2 SNPs in individual population can be undertaken. SHORT CONCLUSION: Thus, screening for novel SNPs focussing on recently identified critical regions of ACE2 can be targeted to monitor susceptibility towards coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Chaudhary, Mayank",Egypt J Med Hum Genet,5,8

Superinfections may contribute to the overall high mortality in those suffering from severe COVID19. We aimed to study the rate of coinfections and secondary bacterial/fungal infections among SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in a community hospital. METHODS: This is a single-centre IRB approved, retrospective observational study. Adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase–Polymerase Chain Reaction assay of nasopharyngeal swabs admitted from March 1st to April 20th 2020 were included. Relevant clinical and laboratory data were manually collected from electronic medical records. RESULTS: A total of 129 patients were included in the study. 91 patients had a respiratory pathogen panel PCR on admission. This panel includes testing for influenza, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Only one patient was positive for coinfection with the parainfluenza virus. None of them was found to be positive for bacterial coinfection at admission. Thirteen patients (10.1%) had secondary bacterial or fungal infections that developed during their respective hospital stays, 12 of them were critically ill. The mean duration from admission to the onset of secondary infection was 13 days. Positive Blood Cultures [Image: see text] Positive Lower Respiratory Tract Cultures [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Our data revealed that the rate of viral coinfection was 1.1 % and bacterial coinfection was 0% at admission. Study timing can play a role as upper respiratory virus infection rate is low in the population during March and April. Secondary infections were found to be common in patients admitted to the ICU. Potential explanations for this include compromised immunity in severely ill patients, extended ICU stay, central venous catheters and endotracheal intubation. It is evident that with severe COVID-19 illness, an extended hospital course often ensues, leading to increased risk of secondary infections and contributing to the overall high mortality of these patients.

The study explores the role of MSSK with extended vulnerability of women during the lockdown period at large. This study adopts an exploratory qualitative method. A total of 36 married women who had filed a complaint with MSSK before and during the lockdown were included. Interviews with the women were held through telephonic conversations on vulnerability, coping mechanism and extent and forms of social support. Thematic content analysis was done in a stepwise manner. Results show that degeneration of social support model is time -bound and the accuracy of applying this model wane under extended condition of vulnerability caused due to COVID-19. MSSK can expand support by creating and integrating virtual community networks to detect and deter violence during the lockdown. The study suggests that the government can ensure and empower bystanders with skills of modern communication.

The project is placed within a broader context of relevant research in architectural robotics, in situ robotic fabrication, and adaptive and reconfigurable architecture. It establishes a methodology for spatial configuration through the implementation of a custom collaborative robotic interior reconfiguration system. Within this system, human users and task-specific robots perform complementary tasks toward a dynamic spatial goal that is defined by a set of evaluative criteria intended to predict successful interior space configurations (Bailey et al. in Humanizing digital reality: design modeling symposium Paris 2017, Springer Singapore, Singapore, pp 337–348, 2018). Venturing beyond robotics as merely a means of construction automation, the presented research deploys an approach that critically engages future models of interaction between humans and robotic architecture, mediated by in situ, architecturally embedded machines. In contrast to a conventional collaborative robotic manufacturing process, where a human worker is executing fabrication and manufacturing tasks according to a pre-designed blueprint, the proposed approach engages the human user as the designer, the worker, and the consumer of the architectural outcome. This gives the occupant the agency to rapidly reconfigure their environment in response to changing programmatic needs as well as the ability to respond ad hoc to outside forces, such as social distancing requirements for the post-quarantine re-occupation of buildings. Furthermore, task-specificity of the presented robotic system allows us to speculate on future roles of designers in the development of architectural fabrication technology beyond the appropriation of existing hardware and to look towards systems that are architecture specific.","Yablonina, Maria; Ringley, Brian; Brugnaro, Giulio; Menges, Achim",Constr Robot,5,5

However, research suggests that these kinds of relationships are often fraught with ingroup versus outgroup divisions, which disrupt coordination and hamper operational performance. Against this backdrop, this chapter takes an identity perspective to shed light on the causes of these divisions and potential solutions that may facilitate better relations and cooperation across workplace boundaries. The chapter incorporates recent academic literature in the safety and security domain as well as relevant empirical research to provide evidence-based recommendations. In particular, I discuss how organisations may support positive cooperative actions through communication and rhetoric, through the adoption of human resource management practices related to selection and training, and through boundary-spanning processes and leadership roles.","Horton, Kate E.",International Security Management,5,16

This context provided conditions for a large-scale testing strategy, allowing a referral system considering other symptoms besides the ones that were part of the case definition (fever, cough, and dyspnea). This study aims to identify other symptoms associated with COVID-19 since it may clarify the pre-test probability of the occurrence of the disease. METHODS: This case-control study uses primary care registers between March 29 and May 10, 2020 in Ovar municipality. Pre-test clinical and exposure-risk characteristics, reported by physicians, were collected through a form, and linked with their laboratory result. RESULTS: The study population included a total of 919 patients, of whom 226 (24.6%) were COVID-19 cases and 693 were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Only 27.1% of the patients reporting contact with a confirmed or suspected case tested positive. In the multivariate analysis, statistical significance was obtained for headaches (OR 0.558), odynophagia (OR 0.273), anosmia (OR 2.360), and other symptoms (OR 2.157). The interaction of anosmia and odynophagia appeared as possibly relevant with a borderline statistically significant OR of 3.375. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has a wide range of symptoms. Of the myriad described, the present study highlights anosmia itself and calls for additional studies on the interaction between anosmia and odynophagia. Headaches and odynophagia by themselves are not associated with an increased risk for the disease. These findings may help clinicians in deciding when to test, especially when other diseases with similar symptoms are more prevalent, namely in winter.","Sá, Regina; Pinho-Bandeira, Tiago; Queiroz, Guilherme; Matos, Joana; Ferreira, João Duarte; Rodrigues, Pedro Pereira",,5,1

Concerns for COVID-19 disease increased the risk of immunomodulatory or biologic treatment discontinuation. Furthermore, lockdown threatened the continuity of chronic care delivery. To guarantee the continuity of care our IBD unit rapidly adapted and developed new ways of remote communication. This included telephonic clinics and telephonic pre-admission screening before every appointment at the dayclinic. In this process the IBD nurse played a pivotal role. The aim was to assess patients’ concerns during the first COVID-19 wave and their acceptance of telemedicine. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed using an anonymous electronic questionnaire (REDCap®) to assess IBD patients’ satisfaction regarding care delivery at the IBD unit of the Ghent University Hospital during the first COVID-19 wave. RESULTS: A total of 274 patients participated. Mean age was 47.5 years (SD ± 15.4). According to patients’ answers, 57.2% had Crohn’s disease, 34.5% ulcerative colitis and 8.3% reported ‘other’. During the first wave, 43.6% of patients contacted their IBD nurse; usually questions regarding medication (20.6%), appointments (18.4%) or SARS-CoV2 infection risk (6%). For the majority of patients (96.5%) these contacts were sufficient. In person follow-up consultation was scheduled for 178 patients. From those, 31 considered cancelling their consultation due to the pandemic and 18 effectively cancelled (Fig 1). [Image: see text] Half of the population (51.6%) received intravenous therapy at the day clinic. Telephonic pre-admission screening the day before was done for all patients and well received in most of them (98.5%). During the first wave, endoscopy was planned in 31.5% of the responding patients. A minority (11.1%) postponed or cancelled endoscopic appointments. From those, 55.6% reported that the main reason was fear of the coronavirus. Ninety-four (39.2%) of responders had a telephonic consultation during the first wave. Different aspects regarding satisfaction and acceptance of telemedicine were also assessed (Fig 2–3). [Image: see text] [Image: see text] For further follow-up, 60.2% preferred balanced combination of telephonic and face-to-face consultations. CONCLUSION: Remote ways of care delivery were generally well received during the first wave of the pandemic. Only a minority of patients cancelled appointments without discussion with the medical team. The most frequent patient concerns were about medications and appointments. The challenges in continuity of care during the pandemic created a window for new ways of care delivery in the future.","Dewitte, G; Geldof, J; Truyens, M; Lobaton, T",J Crohns Colitis,5,22

The aim of the study was to investigate whether 18F-FDG PET/CT was superior to CT as an initial imaging modality in patients with NSSC. In a randomized prospective trial, the imaging modalities were compared with regard to diagnostic performance. Methods: Two hundred patients were randomized 1:1 to whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT or CT of the thorax and abdomen as the imaging modality. A tentative diagnosis was established after first-line imaging. The final referral diagnosis was adjudicated by the physician, when sufficient data were available. Results: One hundred ninety-seven patients were available for analysis because 3 patients withdrew consent before scanning. Thirty-nine (20%) patients were diagnosed with cancer, 10 (5%) with an infection, 15 (8%) with an autoimmune disease, and 76 (39%) with other diseases. In the remaining 57 patients (28%), no specific disease was found. 18F-FDG PET/CT had a higher specificity (96% vs. 85%; P = 0.028) and a higher accuracy (94% vs. 82%; P = 0.017) than CT. However, there were no statistically significant differences in sensitivity (83% vs. 70%) or negative predictive values (96% vs. 92%). No difference in days to final referral diagnosis according to randomization group could be shown (7.2 vs. 7.6 d). However, for the subgroups in which the imaging modality showed a suggestion of malignancy, there was a significant delay to final diagnosis in the CT group compared with the 18F-FDG PET/CT group (11.6 vs. 5.7 d; P = 0.02). Conclusion: Compared with CT, we found a higher diagnostic specificity and accuracy of 18F-FDG PET/CT for detecting cancer in patients with NSSC. 18F-FDG PET/CT should therefore be considered as first-line imaging in this group of patients.","Lebech, Anne-Mette; Gaardsting, Anne; Loft, Annika; Graff, Jesper; Markova, Elena; Bertelsen, Anne Kiil; Madsen, Jan Lysgård; Andersen, Kim Francis; Benzon, Eric von; Helms, Morten; Mathiesen, Lars R; David, Kim P; Kronborg, Gitte; Kjaer, Andreas","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",5,16

We performed a prospective study of diagnostic accuracy to find new blood velocity cut-offs in duplex ultrasound for in-stent restenosis. Patients and methods Stented patients within the international carotid stenting study were eligible. Patients had a carotid computed tomography angiography in addition to routine duplex ultrasound performed at a yearly follow-up. Duplex-ultrasound bloodflow velocity parameters were compared to the degree of stenosis on computed tomography angiography. The results were analysed using receiver-operating-characteristic curves. Results We included 103 patients in this study. On computed tomography angiography, 30 (29.1%) patients had a 30%-49% in-stent restenosis, 21 (20.4%) patients had 50%-69% in-stent restenosis and 5 (4.9%) patients a ≥70% in-stent restenosis. The cut-off value ≥50% stenosis was a peak systolic velocity of 125 cm/s (sensitivity: 63% (95% CI: 41-79), specificity: 83% (95% CI: 72-90)). Discussion This study provides a level 2b evidence for new cut-off values for in-stent restenosis. Unfortunately, we could not say anything about severe stenosis because of the low number of severe stenosis after one year. Conclusions The 125 cm/s cut-off value on duplex ultrasound is lower than found in previous studies and equal to unstented arteries. Duplex-ultrasound measurements made in stented carotid arteries should not be corrected for the presence of a stent when determining the degree of stenosis.","Bosch, Floris Tm; Hendrikse, Jeroen; Davagnanam, Indran; Bonati, Leo H; van der Lugt, Aad; van der Worp, H B; de Borst, Gert J; Mali, Willem; Brown, Martin M; Nederkoorn, Paul J",European stroke journal,5,33

RESEARCH QUESTION The objective of the study is to delineate the clinical profile, predictors of disease progression, and 30-day mortality from ARDS using the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Analysis of a historical cohort of 7,816 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection between January 1, 2020, and August 1, 2020. Main outcomes were progression to ARDS and 30-day mortality from ARDS, respectively. RESULTS The cohort was comprised predominantly of men (94.5%) with a median age of 69 years (interquartile range [IQR] 60-74 years). 2,184 (28%) were admitted to the intensive care unit and 643 (29.4%) were diagnosed with ARDS. The median Charlson Index was 3 (IQR 1-5). Independent predictors of progression to ARDS were body mass index (BMI) ≥40 kg/m2, diabetes, lymphocyte counts <700 × 109/L, LDH >450 U/L, ferritin >862 ng/ml, C-reactive protein >11 mg/dL, and D-dimer >1.5 ug/ml. In contrast, the use of an anticoagulant lowered the risk of developing ARDS (OR 0.66 [95% CI 0.49-0.89]. Crude 30-day mortality rate from ARDS was 41% (95% CI 38%-45%). Risk of death from ARDS was significantly higher in those who developed acute renal failure and septic shock. Use of an anticoagulant was associated with 2-fold reduction in mortality. Survival benefit was observed in patients who received corticosteroids and/or remdesivir but there was no advantage of combination therapy over either agent alone. CONCLUSIONS Among those hospitalized for COVID-19, nearly 1 in 10 progressed to ARDS. Septic shock, and acute renal failure are the leading causes of death in these patients. Treatment with either remdesivir and corticosteroids reduced the risk of mortality from ARDS. All hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should be placed at a minimum on prophylactic doses of anticoagulation.","El-Solh, Ali A; Meduri, Umberto G; Lawson, Yolanda; Carter, Michael; Mergenhagen, Kari A",Journal of intensive care medicine,5,13

As many as 30% of hospital staff say that they plan not to report for work during a large-scale disaster. We sought to understand the personal disaster preparedness for hospital staff. METHODS Surveys were distributed to the staff of a large academic tertiary-care hospital by either a paper-based version distributed through the departmental safety coordinators or a Web-based version distributed through employee e-mail services, depending on employee familiarity with and access to computer services. Surveys assessed the demographic variables and characteristics of personal readiness for disaster. RESULTS Of the individuals who accessed the survey, 1334 (95.9%) enrolled in it. Women made up 75% of the respondents, with a mean age of 43 years. Respondents had worked at the hospital an average of 9 years, with the majority (90%) being full-time employees. Most households (93%) reported ≤4 members, 6% supported a person with special medical needs, and 17% were headed by a single parent. A small number (24%) of respondents reported an established meeting place for reuniting households during a disaster. Many reported stockpiling a 3-day supply of food (86%) and a 3-day supply of water (51%). Eighteen percent of respondents were not aware of workplace evacuation plans. Most respondents were willing to report to work for natural disasters (eg, tornado, snowstorm; all categories >65%), but fewer respondents were willing to report during events such as an influenza epidemic (54%), a biological outbreak (41%), a chemical exposure, (40%), or a radiation exposure (39%). Multivariate analysis revealed being female, having a child in the household younger than 6 years old, and having a child in school lowered the likelihood of being willing to report to work in two or more event types, whereas pet ownership, being a clinical healthcare worker, and being familiar with the work emergency plan increased the likelihood. CONCLUSIONS Despite being employed at the same facility for a prolonged period, employees reported being willing to report for work at a low rate in a variety of disasters. Subjects reported suboptimal personal preparedness for disaster, which may further limit the number of staff who will report for work. Hospitals should promote personal disaster preparedness for staff and explore staffing models with an understanding of reduced staff availability during disasters.","Brice, Jane H; Gregg, David; Sawyer, Dalton; Cyr, Julianne M",Southern medical journal,5,1

METHODS A comprehensive PubMed search was performed for all relevant urological literature regarding LESS and adrenal surgery. In addition, experience gained at the authors' own institutions was considered. Clinical descriptive and comparative reports on LESS adrenal surgery procedures were analysed. RESULTS LESS adrenal surgery has been effectively performed for a number of indications. A wide variety of approaches (transperitoneal versus retroperitoneal, multichannel trocar versus multiple ports, trans- or extraumbilical) have been described. LESS adrenalectomy seems to be safe, taking more time than the standard laparoscopic counterpart but appears to offer the patient less postoperative discomfort. Technical difficulties of the procedure include the requirement of more time for adjustment of articulating instruments, longer 'one-handed' manipulation time, and a high peroperative tissue re-grasping rate. CONCLUSIONS The feasibility and safety of LESS adrenalectomy has been demonstrated. Only long-term follow-up outcomes will prove its benefits over conventional laparoscopy and define the role and the oncological safety of LESS adrenal surgery.","Rane, Abhay; Cindolo, Luca; Schips, Luigi; De Sio, Marco; Autorino, Riccardo",World journal of urology,5,1

These carbohydrate-binding agents (CBA) strongly inhibited various influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and B viruses in vitro, with EC50 values ranging from 0.016 to 83 nM, generating selectivity indexes up to 125,000. Somewhat less activity was observed against the A/PR/8/34 and an A(H1N1)pdm09 strain. In time-of-addition experiments, these CBA lost their inhibitory activity when added 30 min p.i. Interference with virus entry processes was also evident from strong inhibition of virus-induced hemolysis at low pH. However, a direct effect on acid-induced refolding of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) was excluded by the tryptic digestion assay. Instead, HHA treatment of HA-expressing cells led to a significant reduction of plasma membrane mobility. Crosslinking of membrane glycoproteins, through interaction with HA, could also explain the inhibitory effect on the release of newly formed virions when HHA was added at 6 h p.i. These CBA presumably interact with one or more N-glycans on the globular head of HA, since their absence led to reduced activity against mutant influenza B viruses and HHA-resistant A(H1N1) viruses. The latter condition only emerged after 33 cell culture passages in the continuous presence of HHA, and the A(H3N2) virus even retained full sensitivity after 50 passages. Thus, these CBA qualify as potent inhibitors of influenza A and B viruses in vitro with a pleiotropic mechanism of action and a high barrier for viral resistance.","Vanderlinden, Evelien; Van Winkel, Nathalie; Naesens, Lieve; Van Damme, Els J M; Persoons, Leentje; Schols, Dominique",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,5,1

The allograft duodenum was anastomosed to the recipient jejunum or duodenum. Duodenal drainage was performed by a stapled or hand-sewn technique. Patient demographics, operative times, major post-operative complications, and graft survival data were analyzed. Of 57 pancreas transplants, DJ was performed in 36 patients, stapled DD in 14 patients, and hand-sewn DD in seven patients. Two DD grafts (9.5%) thrombosed compared with no DJ grafts (p = NS). Enteric leak and small-bowel obstruction occurred in 3 of 36 DJ patients and in two DD patients (p = NS). Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred more frequently in stapled DD compared with DJ (4 vs. 0, p < 0.015). In conclusion, DD is technically feasible with no increase in operative time or enteric complications. GI bleeding rates appear to be higher following DD (stapled) technique.

Coronavirus (COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) as a viral pneumonia causative agent, infects thousands of people in China and worldwide. There is currently no specific medicine or vaccine available and it is considered a threat to develop effective novel drug or anti-coronavirus vaccine treatment. However, natural compounds to treat coronaviruses are the most alternative and complementary therapies due to their diverse range of biological and therapeutic properties. METHODS We performed an open-ended, English restricted search of Scopus database, Web of Science, and Pubmed for all available literature from Jan-March, 2020, using terms related to phytochemical compounds, medicinal plants and coronavirus. RESULTS The view on anti-coronavirus (anti-CoV) activity in the plant derived phytochemicals and medicinal plants give the strong base to develop a novel treatment of corona virus activity.

New Zealand moved swiftly to the highest alert level 4, described as lockdown, as the epidemic curve quickly accelerated. Auckland City Hospital saw a temporary change in acute surgical admissions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the national lockdown on emergency general surgery. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed of all patients admitted to Auckland City Hospital via the Acute Surgical Unit during lockdown from 26 March to 27 April 2020. A comparison group was collected from the 33 days prior to lockdown, 22 February to 25 March 2020. RESULTS The number of admissions decreased by 26% (p-value 0.000). A 56.8% decrease in patients presenting with trauma was found (p-value 0.002). After exclusion of trauma patients, no statistical difference in discharge diagnosis was found. There was a 43.6% reduction in operations performed (p-value 0.037). There was a difference found in the management of appendicitis and cholecystitis (p-value 0.003).

Pulmonary inflammation plays a crucial role in its pathogenesis, and glucocorticoid is one potential therapy to prevent BPD. OBJECTIVES To compare the effect of intratracheal administration of surfactant/budesonide with that of surfactant alone on the incidence of death or BPD. METHODS A clinical trial was conducted in three tertiary neonatal centers in the United States and Taiwan, in which 265 very-low-birth-weight infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome who required mechanical ventilation and inspired oxygen (fraction of inspired oxygen, ≥50%) within 4 hours of birth were randomly assigned to one of two groups (131 intervention and 134 control). The intervention infants received surfactant (100 mg/kg) and budesonide (0.25 mg/kg), and the control infants received surfactant only (100 mg/kg), until each infant required inspired O2 at less than 30% or was extubated. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The intervention group had a significantly lower incidence of BPD or death (55 of 131 [42.0%] vs. 89 of 134 [66%]; risk ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.77; P < 0.001; number needed to treat, 4.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.8-7.8).

However, alterations in metabolism during sepsis are multifaceted and are incompletely understood. Acute anorexia during infection is an evolutionarily conserved response, suggesting a potential protective role of anorexia in the host response to infection. In animal models of bacterial inflammation, fasting metabolic programs associated with acute anorexia such as those regulated by fibroblast growth factor 21 and ketogenesis are associated with improved survival. Other fasting metabolic pathways such as fatty acid oxidation and autophagy are also implicated in preventing acute kidney injury (AKI).

In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of Eadyn to predict the arterial blood pressure response to a fluid challenge (FC) in preload-dependent, spontaneously breathing patients. METHODS Patients admitted postoperatively and monitored with the Nexfin monitor (BMEYE, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) were enrolled in the study. Patients were included in the analysis if they were spontaneously breathing and had an increase in cardiac output ≥10% during an FC. Patients were classified according to the increase in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) after FC into MAP-responders (MAP increase ≥10%) and MAP-nonresponders (MAP increase <10%). Eadyn was continuously calculated from the PPV and SVV values obtained from the monitor. RESULTS Thirty-four FCs from 26 patients were studied. Seventeen FCs (50%) induced a positive MAP response. Preinfusion Eadyn was significantly higher in MAP-responders (1.39 ± 0.41 vs 0.85 ± 0.23; P = 0.0001). Preinfusion Eadyn predicted a positive MAP response to FC with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.92 ± 0.04 of standard error (95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.99; P < 0.0001). A preinfusion Eadyn value ≥1.06 (gray zone: 0.9-1.15) discriminated MAP-responders with a sensitivity and specificity of 88.2% (approximate 95% confidence interval, 64%-99%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Noninvasive Eadyn, defined as the PPV to SVV ratio, predicted the arterial blood pressure increase to fluid administration in spontaneously breathing, preload-dependent patients.","Cecconi, Maurizio; Monge García, M Ignacio; Gracia Romero, Manuel; Mellinghoff, Johannes; Caliandro, Francesca; Grounds, Robert Michael; Rhodes, Andrew",Anesthesia and analgesia,5,16

Improving ELISAs is crucial for detecting biomolecules relates to health disorders and facilitating diagnosis at the early diseases stages. Several methods have been developed to improve the ELISA sensitivity through immobilization of antibodies on the microtiter plates. We have developed a highly sensitive ELISA strategy based on the preparation of acetylated chitosan surfaces in order to improve the antibodies orientation. RESULTS Chitin surfaces were obtained by mixing small quantities of chitosan and acetic anhydride in each well of a microtiter plate. Anti-c-myc 9E10 low affinity antibody fused to ChBD was cloned and expressed in CHO cells obtaining the anti-c-myc-ChBD antibody. We found that anti c-myc-ChBD binds specifically to the chitin surfaces in comparison with anti-c-myc 9E10, which did not. Chitin surface was used to develop a sandwich ELISA to detect the chimeric human protein c-myc-GST-IL8 cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The ELISA assays developed on chitin surfaces were 6-fold more sensitive than those performed on standard surface with significant differences (p<0,0001). CONCLUSIONS As shown here, acetylated chitosan surfaces improve the antibody orientation on the substrate and constitute a suitable method to replace the standard surfaces given the stability over time and the low cost of its preparation.","García-Maceira, Tania; García-Maceira, Fé I; González-Reyes, José A; Paz-Rojas, Elier",BMC biotechnology,5,1

The etiology of resistant hypertension is almost always multifactorial, but the results of numerous studies indicate that renal sympathetic activation is a particularly common cause of resistance to antihypertensive treatment. Consistent with the belief in a pivotal role of renal sympathetic stimulation, there has been a growing interest in renal denervation (RDN) treatment strategies. The long-awaited results of SYMPLICITY HTN-3 study disclosed that the reduction in blood pressure by the SYMPLICITY device did not differ from that in the sham-procedure arm of the study. In the present article, we identify several factors that explain why the study failed to demonstrate any benefit from the intervention. The reasons are multifactorial and include inadequate screening at entry and frequent medication changes during the study. Additional problems include the lack of experience of many operators with the SYMPLICITY device and procedure variability, as attested to by a diminished number of ablation ""quadrants."" Also a factor was the inability of the first generation Medtronic device to allow four ablations to be performed simultaneously. We recommend that future RDN studies adhere to more rigorous screening procedures, and utilize newer multi-site denervation systems that facilitate four ablations simultaneously. Drug optimization should be achieved by monitoring adherence throughout the study. Nevertheless, we are optimistic about a future role of RDN. To optimize chances of success, increased efforts are necessary to identify the appropriate patients for RDN and investigators must use second and third generation denervation devices and techniques.","Epstein, Murray; de Marchena, Eduardo",Journal of the American Society of Hypertension : JASH,5,1

The impact of financial relationships with industry sponsorship and COI reporting on surgical outcomes of abdominal wall reconstruction with acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) has not been previously explored. METHODS A systematic review of the literature for studies that evaluated surgical outcomes in abdominal wall reconstruction using ADM was conducted. The level of evidence of these studies was evaluated; and data concerning the type of industry, government, or national society sponsorship, primary outcome, complications, and statistical results were collected. The overall favorability of the study with respect to ADM use was systematically assessed. Comparisons between type of sponsorship and significant results were analyzed using the Pearson χ2 test. RESULTS A total of 204 studies were identified, of which 124 fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Sixty-four (52%) studies had a disclosure statement present. Conflict of interest was reported in 39 (61%) of these studies. Taken collectively, studies that report no COI are more likely to be unfunded (P<0.001). Studies with a reported COI are more likely to report a favorable outcome with respect to infection (P<0.01), wound complications (P<0.01), and overall morbidity (P<0.07) and mortality (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Industry sponsorship and COI are common in abdominal wall reconstruction studies with ADM. Studies authored by groups disclosing an industry conflict that report clinical outcomes are significantly associated with reporting lower postoperative complications, and consequently describing positive research findings.","DeGeorge, Brent R; Holland, Michael C; Drake, David B",Annals of plastic surgery,5,1

METHODS A lentivirus vector was used to generate transgenic chickens expressing small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the M protein of IBV. Offspring of generation 0 (G0) were screened to identify G1 transgenic chickens (Tg). Monocytes from G1 Tg were stimulated with IBV in vitro. RESULTS Monocytes producing siRNA efficiently inhibit IBV replication. Expression of inflammatory cytokines, Mx protein and nitric oxide levels were lower in early IBV infection in Tg. In vivo experiments show that siRNA expression inhibits IBV replication, significantly decreases mortality and increases weight gain. Inflammatory responses and oxidative damage were significantly decreased, yielding minimal tissue injury. The inflammatory responses indicate that the cellular immune response is most effective during the initial stage, while the humoral immune response is more significant in later stages of infection. CONCLUSIONS Small interfering RNA expression inhibits avian IBV replication and inflammatory response.","Yu, Kun; Deng, Shoulong; Wang, Hai; Zhang, Yi; Chen, Xuehui; Wang, Kejun; Hu, Rui; Lian, Zhengxing; Li, Ning",Antiviral therapy,5,1

Vitamin E has shown beneficial effects as a possible ""scavenger"" of oxidative stress products, which play a major role in pathogenesis of the disease. AIMS The purpose of the present meta-analysis is to investigate the effects of vitamin E supplementation in biochemical and histological parameters in adult patients with NAFLD. METHODS Literature search was performed in major electronic databases (MEDLINE, CENTRAL and EMBASE) up to June 2020 for randomized clinical trials, which examined vitamin E versus placebo treatment in adults with NAFLD. Changes in liver enzymes were considered as primary outcomes, while changes in histology, biochemical and metabolic parameters as secondary. Quality of evidence was assessed through risk of bias according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS Eight studies were included in qualitative analysis and seven in quantitative analysis. Vitamin E reduced the values of liver enzymes compared to placebo (-7.37 IU/L, 95% CI: -10.11 to -4.64 for ALT and -5.71 IU/L, 95% CI: -9.49 to -1.93 for AST) Additionally, vitamin E improved statistically significantly liver pathology in every individual histologic parameter as well LDL, FBG and serum leptin values. CONCLUSIONS Vitamin E can improve biochemical and histological characteristics of NAFLD patients, especially of NASH patients. The results indicate that vitamin E could be a promising choice and be considered as a treatment option in patients with NAFLD.","Vadarlis, Andreas; Antza, Christina; Bakaloudi, Dimitra Rafailia; Doundoulakis, Ioannis; Kalopitas, Georgios; Samara, Myrto; Dardavessis, Theodoros; Maris, Theofanis; Chourdakis, Michael",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,5,17

METHODS In the last week of March 2020 (at the beginning of phase 2 of the Ministry of Health's national campaign in Mexico), a study was conducted on healthcare workers of a pediatric COVID hospital in Mexico City. Using a virtual interview, we evaluated comorbidities, mobility, areas and functions where they carry out the activities, protection measures, contact history, and vaccination. According to their activities, healthcare workers were classified into the following areas: medical, nursing, other health-care personnel (researchers, nutritionists, rehabilitation, imaging, and laboratory), administrative, and other services. We compared the variables between the groups of healthcare workers with the X2 test. RESULTS We included 812 participants.

To meet learner needs and improve the likelihood of successful implementation and utilization, we assessed radiology trainee attitudes and experiences of podcasts. MATERIALS AND METHODS We developed an educational podcast, From the Viewbox, focused on evergreen themes and practical approaches to radiology. Content categories included Diagnostic Approach, Specific Imaging Diagnoses, Noninterpretive Skills, and Special Topics. We released and promoted episodes on multiple digital platforms. Radiology trainees were surveyed and data were analyzed to assess listener preferences and usage trends. RESULTS Only 19% of our trainees had previously listened to a radiology podcast, yet 81% expressed interest in listening routinely. After initial release, 86% of trainees listened to the podcast and 62% listened routinely. Episodes gained the most plays immediately following release but retained and continued to attract more listeners. The most popular episode discussing COVID-19 diagnosis and imaging, emphasized the importance of selecting high yield content to match listener needs. Most trainees felt the podcast had ""very high"" or ""high"" value in educational value, accessibility, and time efficiency. CONCLUSIONS From the Viewbox offers efficient and accessible audio-only learning modules that can be used independently or effectively paired with traditional resources to decrease barriers in radiology education and enhance learner productivity. Podcasting is an underutilized asynchronous remote learning tool that can help overcome current challenges of social distancing, and more importantly address the diverse preferences and needs of our learners.","Shiang, Tina; Cerniglia, Christopher; Lin, Hannah; Lo, Hao S",Clinical imaging,5,29

Among all the infected countries around the globe as of now (June 15, 2020), the total reported confirmed positive cases are 7,805,148 with the death of 431,192. At present, no specialized treatments evolved to cure COVID-19. Treatment is symptomatic. Though huge effects are being made to produce potential therapies to scuffle this COVID-19, no drug has been discovered so far. OBJECTIVE Natural products playing a significant role in disease control since ancient days. These products are serving as templates for designing new anti-microbial agents with a different mechanism of action and also open a door for investigation of effective anti-viral drugs to combat COVID-19. By focusing on this, the authors have narrated the basic structure, infection, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 virus in humans and also reported various natural products or plantbased extracts/bioactive compounds tested against coronaviruses like SARS and MERS as these viruses are structurally similar to SARS-CoV2 and can be used in designing novel drug against this virus. CONCLUSIONS The natural products are shown activity against SARS, MERS, and other viruses reviewed in this review article might be having anti-viral activities against the SARS-CoV2 virus and can be used directly for further preclinical studies.

We sought to determine the impact of pulmonary function tests upon complications after thoracoscopic lobectomy. METHODS A model for morbidity, including published preoperative risk factors and surgical approach, was developed by multivariable logistic regression. All patients who underwent lobectomy for primary lung cancer between December 1999 and October 2007 with preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) or diffusion capacity to carbon monoxide (Dlco) 60% or less predicted were reviewed. Preoperative, histopathologic, perioperative, and outcome variables were assessed using standard descriptive statistics. Pulmonary complications were defined as atelectasis requiring bronchoscopy, pneumonia, reintubation, and tracheostomy. RESULTS During the study period, 340 patients (median age 67) with Dlco or FEV1 60% or less (mean % predicted FEV1, 55+/-1; mean % predicted Dlco, 61+/-1) underwent lobectomy (173 thoracoscopy, 167 thoracotomy). Operative mortality was 5% (17 patients) and overall morbidity was 48% (164 patients). At least one pulmonary complication occurred in 57 patients (17%). Significant predictors of pulmonary complications by multivariable analysis for all patients included Dlco (odds ratio 1.03, p=0.003), FEV1 (odds ratio 1.04, p=0.003), and thoracotomy as surgical approach (odds ratio 3.46, p=0.0007). When patients were analyzed according to operative approach, Dlco and FEV1 remained significant predictors of pulmonary morbidity for patients undergoing thoracotomy but not thoracoscopy. CONCLUSIONS In patients with impaired pulmonary function, preoperative pulmonary function tests are predictors of pulmonary complications when lobectomy for lung cancer is performed through thoracotomy but not through thoracoscopy.","Berry, Mark F; Villamizar-Ortiz, Nestor R; Tong, Betty C; Burfeind, William R; Harpole, David H; D'Amico, Thomas A; Onaitis, Mark W",The Annals of thoracic surgery,5,33

Early recognition of brain ischaemia may improve the final outcome of the trauma victim. The primary aim of this study was to examine the correlation between peripheral oxygen pulse oximetry and brain oxygen saturation measured by a near infrared oximetry device. A second aim was to evaluate the influence of different factors such as fluid and blood administration on brain tissue oxygenation. METHODS This was a prospective pilot study. Mechanically ventilated trauma patients admitted to the trauma unit had cerebral-somatic oxygen saturation monitoring. Oximeter readings (rSO2) were prospectively collected and compared with concurrent values for peripheral pulse oximetry (SO2). Data were recorded every 15 min and during interventions such as administration of a fluid bolus and blood administration. All interventions were based on accepted clinical parameters. RESULTS Thirty-three patients were enrolled. A total of 210 simultaneous measurements of rSO2 and pulse oximetry values were performed. There was correlation between these two parameters in only one third of patients. Twenty-seven events of possible brain ischemia, defined as rSO2 values less than 50 or a decrease of more than 20% from the baseline, were observed. In 68 (77.2%) of these measurements there was no decrease of peripheral SO2. Significant increases in rSO2 were observed only during administration of fluid boluses. CONCLUSIONS A cerebral oxygenation monitoring device may recognize the possible events of brain ischaemia which are not reflected by pulse oximetry.

There is an urgent need for new treatment approaches for this difficult cancer. METHODS We previously established an original cell line, HSC-60, from a scirrhous gastric cancer patient and isolated a peritoneal-metastatic cell line, 60As6, in nude mice following orthotopic inoculations. In the present study, we focused on the expression of long noncoding ribonucleic acid (RNA) (lncRNA) in the cell lines and investigated the mechanism on peritoneal dissemination. RESULTS We demonstrated that an lncRNA, HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR), is expressed significantly more highly in 60As6 than HSC-60 cells. Then, using both HOTAIR knockdown and overexpression experiments, we showed that high-level expression of HOTAIR promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in 60As6 cells. By luciferase assay, we found that HOTAIR directly targets and binds to miR-217, and that miR-217 directly binds to Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1). The knockdown of HOTAIR in 60As6 cells significantly reduced the invasion activity and peritoneal dissemination - and significantly prolonged the survival - in the orthotopic tumor mouse model. CONCLUSION An EMT-associated pathway (the HOTAIR-miR-217-ZEB1 axis) appears to inhibit peritoneal dissemination and could lead to a novel therapeutic strategy against scirrhous gastric cancer in humans.","Takei, Yoshifumi; Hara, Toshifumi; Suzuki, Akiko; Mihara, Keichiro; Yanagihara, Kazuyoshi","Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",5,22

DESIGN Prospective cohort survey study, 30 April - 18 May 2020. SETTING, PARTICIPANTS Staff (scientists and non-scientists) and students at five medical research institutes in Sydney, New South Wales. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Self-assessed overall and task-specific productivity, and mental health. RESULTS The proportions of non-scientists and scientists who wore pyjamas during the day were similar (3% v 11%; P = 0.31). Wearing pyjamas was not associated with differences in self-evaluated productivity, but was significantly associated with more frequent reporting of poorer mental health than non-pyjama wearers while working from home (59% v 26%; P < 0.001). Having children in the home were significantly associated with changes in productivity. Larger proportions of people with toddlers reported reduced overall productivity (63% v 32%; P = 0.008), and reduced productivity in writing manuscripts (50% v 17%; P = 0.023) and data analysis (63% v 23%; P = 0.002). People with primary school children more frequently reported reduced productivity in writing manuscripts (42% v 16%; P = 0.026) and generating new ideas (43% v 19%; P = 0.030). On a positive note, the presence of children in the home was not associated with changes in mental health during the pandemic. In contrast to established researchers, early career researchers frequently reported reduced productivity while working at home. CONCLUSIONS Our findings are probably applicable to scientists in other countries.

However, its clinical importance and management in critically ill patients are not well described. The aim of this scoping review is to assess the epidemiology and management strategies of NOAF during critical illness. METHOD The review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library for studies assessing the incidence, outcome and management strategies of NOAF in adult critically ill patients. The quality of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS A total of 99 studies were included, of which 79 were observational and 20 were interventional. The incidence of NOAF varied from 1.7% to 43.9% with considerable inter-population variation (very low quality of evidence). Commonly identified risk factors for NOAF included higher age, cardiovascular comorbidities and sepsis. The occurrence of NOAF was associated with adverse outcomes, including stroke, prolonged length of stay and mortality (very low quality of evidence). We found limited data on the optimal management strategy with no evidence for firm benefit or harm for any intervention (very low/low quality of evidence). CONCLUSIONS The definition and incidence of NOAF in critically ill patients varied considerably and many risk factors were identified. NOAF seemed to be associated with adverse outcomes, but data were very limited and current management strategies are not evidence-based.","Wetterslev, Mik; Haase, Nicolai; Hassager, Christian; Belley-Cote, Emilie P; McIntyre, William F; An, Youzhong; Shen, Jiawei; Cavalcanti, Alexandre Biasi; Zampieri, Fernando G; Guimaraes, Helio Penna; Granholm, Anders; Perner, Anders; Møller, Morten Hylander",Intensive care medicine,5,12

While the precise benefit of screening exclusively by colonoscopy is not yet known, unarguably, the exam is central to the success of any screening programme. The test affords the opportunity to detect and resect neoplasia across the entire large bowel and is the definitive examination when other screening tests are positive. However, colonoscopy is invasive and often requires sedation as well as extensive bowel preparation, all of which puts the patient at risk. Furthermore, the test can technically be demanding and, unarguably, there is variation in how it is performed. This variation in performance has now been definitively linked to important outcome measures. For example, interval cancers are more common in low adenoma detectors as compared with high adenoma detectors. This review outlines the most current thinking regarding the effectiveness of colonoscopy as a screening tool. It also outlines key concepts to optimise its performance through robust quality assurance programmes and high-quality training.","Robertson, Douglas J; Kaminski, Michal F; Bretthauer, Michael",Gut,5,1

Additionally, we aimed to synthesise the evidence and state of knowledge on this subject. METHODS A database search was performed in nine relevant electronic databases. Inclusion criteria were quantitative peer-reviewed publications empirically investigating the relationship between work/workplace factors and work retention in employees following ABI. The methodological quality was determined by Effective Public Health Practice Project scoring, and evidence was synthesised narratively. RESULTS Thirteen studies were included. We found moderate evidence for a negative relationship between manual work and work retention. We also found limited evidence for a U-shaped relationship between workload and complete work retention at 6 months and no relationship at 12 months; a positive relationship between managers, compared with non-managers, and faster work retention; a positive relationship between large enterprise size defined as ≥250 employees, and no relationship between large enterprise size, defined as ≥1000 employees, and work retention. CONCLUSION Relative to individual factors, there is little evidence on specific workplace factors' relationship to work retention among employees with ABI. For most workplace factors, there were too few high-quality studies to designate evidence as more than limited or insufficient. Future studies should replicate rigorous studies of well-defined modifiable workplace factors related to work retention.

From 16 FIP and 14 non-FIP cats, we evaluated retrospectively the sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) of serum protein electrophoresis, α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) on peripheral blood, screening reverse-transcription nested PCR (RT-nPCR) on the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), and spike (S) gene sequencing on peripheral blood, body cavity effusions, and tissue, as well as body cavity cytology and delta total nucleated cell count (ΔTNC). Any of these tests on blood, and especially the molecular tests, may support or confirm a clinical diagnosis of FIP. A negative result does not exclude the disease except for AGP. Cytology, 3'-UTR PCR, and ΔTNC may confirm a clinical diagnosis on effusions; cytology or 3'-UTR PCR may exclude FIP. Conversely, S gene sequencing is not recommended based on the LRs. On tissues, S gene sequencing is preferable when histology is highly consistent with FIP, and 3'-UTR PCR when FIP is unlikely. Combining one test with high LR+ with one with low LR- (e.g., molecular tests and AGP on blood, ΔTNC and cytology in effusions) may improve the diagnostic power of the most used laboratory tests.","Stranieri, Angelica; Giordano, Alessia; Paltrinieri, Saverio; Giudice, Chiara; Cannito, Valentina; Lauzi, Stefania","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",5,20

This study evaluated whether the Simbionix GI Mentor II virtual reality simulator metrics differentiate gastrointestinal endoscopists with varying clinical experience (known-groups construct validity). METHODS For this study, 20 subjects (medical and surgical) were classified into two groups based on self-reported clinical experience with colonoscopy: a novice group (<5 scope experiences, n = 12) and an experienced group (>50 scope experiences, n = 8). Three virtual colonoscopy simulation modules of increasing difficulty were used (modules I-1, II-2, and I-7). The data reported by the simulator after each module were compared using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Data are expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR). A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS With module 1, only the time taken to reach the cecum was different between the groups: experienced group (1.6 min; IQR, 1.2-1.9 min) versus novice group (3.2 min; IQR, 2.4-4 min) (p < 0.01). With module 2, the two groups differed only in the time needed to reach the cecum (experienced group: 2.3 min; IQR, 1.6-2.3 min vs novice group: 3.3 min; IQR, 2.3-4.2 min; p = 0.03) and overall efficiency (experienced group: 94%; IQR, 94-96% vs novice group: 88%, IQR, 69-92%) (p < 0.01). In contrast, with the module 3 (the most difficult), performance differed between the groups for most of the parameters. The experienced group reached the cecum faster (5.7 min; IQR, 3.6-6.6 min vs. 14 min; IQR, 9-16 min; p < 0.01) and had fewer occasions of lost view (0.5; IQR, 0-1 vs. 2; IQR, 2-3; p < 0.01), fewer episodes of excessive pressure (2; IQR, 1-2 vs. 4.5; IQR, 2.5-6; p < 0.01), and greater overall efficiency (87%; IQR, 82-89% vs. 29%; IQR, 23-55%; p < 0.01). There were no differences in the percentage of time the patient was in pain or in the total time the colon was looped. The experienced group saw slightly less of the mucosa (91%; IQR, 89-92% vs 94%; IQR, 93-95%; p = 0.01). CONCLUSION The GI Mentor II metrics differentiated novice colonoscopists from those with more clinical experience, but primarily when used to evaluate the more complex scenarios. In setting performance benchmarks, the case scenario must be taken into account.","Fayez, Raad; Feldman, Liane S; Kaneva, Pepa; Fried, Gerald M",Surgical endoscopy,5,16

METHODS Eligible patients were aged ≥18 years, had confirmed first (or recurrent) stroke, and were admitted to a stroke unit within 24 hours of stroke onset. Patients were randomized to receive very early and frequent mobilization, commencing within 24 hours, or usual care. We used regression analyses and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) to investigate the effect of timing and dose of mobilization on efficacy and safety outcomes, irrespective of assigned treatment group. RESULTS A total of 2,104 patients were enrolled, of whom 2,083 (99.0%) were followed up at 3 months. We found a consistent pattern of improved odds of favorable outcome in efficacy and safety outcomes with increased daily frequency of out-of-bed sessions (odds ratio [OR] 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09 to 1.18, p < 0.001), keeping time to first mobilization and mobilization amount constant. Increased amount (minutes per day) of mobilization reduced the odds of a good outcome (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.97, p < 0.001). Session frequency was the most important variable in the CART analysis, after prognostic variables age and baseline stroke severity. CONCLUSION These data suggest that shorter, more frequent mobilization early after acute stroke is associated with greater odds of favorable outcome at 3 months when controlling for age and stroke severity. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class III evidence that shorter, more frequent early mobilization improves the chance of regaining independence after stroke.","Bernhardt, Julie; Churilov, Leonid; Ellery, Fiona; Collier, Janice; Chamberlain, Jan; Langhorne, Peter; Lindley, Richard I; Moodie, Marj; Dewey, Helen; Thrift, Amanda G; Donnan, Geoff",Neurology,5,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS The target tissues with four different sizes (dxy = 20, 25, 30 and 35 mm) were modelled using a two-compartment radiofrequency ablation model. Different voltages were applied to seek the maximum target tissue necrosis volume for each target tissue size. The first roll-off occurrence or the standard ablation time (12 min) was taken as the sign for the termination of the RFA procedure. RESULTS Four different maximum voltages without the roll-off occurrence were found for the four different sizes of target tissues (dxy = 20, 25, 30 and 35 mm), and they were 36.6, 35.4, 33.9 and 32.5 V, respectively. The target tissues with diameters of 20, 25 mm can be cleanly ablated at their own maximum voltages applied (MVA) but the same finding was not found for the 35-mm target tissue. For the target tissue with diameter of 30 mm, the 50 °C isothermal contour (IT50) result showed that the target tissue can be cleanly ablated, but the same result did not show in the Arrhenius damage model result. Furthermore, two optimal RFA protocols with a minimal thermal damage to the healthy tissues were found for the target tissues with diameters of 20 and 25 mm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The study suggests that target tissues of different sizes should be treated with different RFA protocols. The maximum target tissue volume was achieved with the MVA without the roll-off occurrence for each target tissue size when a constant RF power supply was used.","Zhang, Bing; Moser, Michael A J; Zhang, Edwin M; Luo, Yigang; Zhang, Hongbo; Zhang, Wenjun","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",5,1

METHODS 11 CL attending surveys and 8 attendings' tele-encounter logs from March-June 2020 were completed and reviewed to assess for patient and provider characteristics associated with barriers to using telepsychiatry. RESULTS The vast majority of 223 tele-psychiatric encounters were acceptable to providers in terms of technology (82%) and their ability to form a connection with the patient (78%). In multivariable logistic regression models, an unresolvable difficulty utilizing the platform was less common for female patients (OR = 0.239, p = 0.002) and more common for patients who prefer a non-English language (OR = 9.059, p < 0.001); achieving a personal connection that felt right was also less likely for patients who prefer a non-English language (OR = 0.189, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Telepsychiatry has previously been limited to outpatient use and, generally, for providers and patients who specifically preferred it. However, abrupt transition to use of telepsychiatry to limit contagion risk was mostly satisfactory in our center; identifying for which patient encounters it is most and least appropriate will help guide future use.","Cheung, Stephanie G; Capote, Justin; Fan, Weijia; Mishkin, Adrienne D",Journal of the Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry,5,33

Evidence of a reduction in dengue case incidence following field releases of wMel-infected Ae. aegypti has been reported previously from a cluster randomised controlled trial in Indonesia, and quasi-experimental studies in Indonesia and northern Australia. Methods: Following a period of intensive community engagement, deployments of adult wMel-infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were conducted in Niteroi, Brazil during 2017 - 2019. Deployments were phased across four release zones, with a total area of 83 km2 and a residential population of approximately 373,000. A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of wMel deployments in reducing dengue and chikungunya incidence. An untreated control zone was pre-defined, which was comparable to the intervention area in historical dengue trends. The wMel intervention effect was estimated by controlled interrupted time series analysis of monthly dengue and chikungunya case notifications to the public health surveillance system before, during and after releases, from release zones and the control zone. Results: Three years after commencement of releases, wMel introgression into local Ae. aegypti populations was heterogeneous throughout Niteroi, reaching a high prevalence (>80%) in the earliest release zone, and more moderate levels (prevalence 40 -70%) elsewhere. Despite this spatial heterogeneity in entomological outcomes, the wMel intervention was associated with a 69% reduction in dengue incidence (95% confidence interval 54%, 80%) and a 60% reduction in chikungunya incidence (95%CI 21%, 80%), in the aggregate release area compared with the pre-defined control area. This significant intervention effect on dengue was replicated across all four release zones, and in three of four zones for chikungunya. Conclusions: We demonstrate that wMel Wolbachia can be successfully introgressed into Ae. aegypti populations in a large and complex urban setting, and that a significant public health benefit from reduced incidence of dengue and chikungunya accrues even where the prevalence of wMel in local mosquito populations is moderate and spatially heterogeneous. These findings are consistent with the results of randomised and non-randomised field trials in Indonesia and northern Australia, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the Wolbachia biocontrol method as a multivalent intervention against both dengue and chikungunya.","Pinto, S.

The program launched in 2014 in Vancouver, BC’s largest urban centre, and expanded to six smaller urban and suburban BC communities in 2016. We sought to measure GetCheckedOnline awareness among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM), and to identify characteristics that may contribute to program awareness.MethodsSex Now was a cross-sectional online health survey of Canadian gbMSM aged ≥15 years recruited from 10/2019–02/2020. BC residents were asked if they knew about GetCheckedOnline and additional questions related to implementation outcomes. We built a multivariable logistic regression model including all variables significant in univariate analysis to quantify associations with awareness, and report adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (AOR [95%CI]).ResultsAmong participants living in regions where GetCheckedOnline is available (n=1132, median age: 36 years), 38.1% were aware of GetCheckedOnline. Greater GetCheckedOnline awareness was associated with living outside of Vancouver (AOR=2.15 [1.50–3.10]), identifying as queer (AOR=1.58 [1.13–2.21]), having post-graduate education (AOR=1.84 [1.17–2.91]), being out to healthcare providers (AOR=1.97 [1.22–3.24]), using ≥3 geolocation-based sex-seeking apps (AOR=2.15 [1.40–3.33]), and past-year involvement in LGBTQ2S+-specific activities (AOR=1.56 [1.10–2.23]). Awareness decreased with increasing years of age (AOR=0.98 [0.97–1.00]). Compared with participants who usually tested for STIs at a sexual health clinic, awareness was lower among participants who usually tested for STIs through their family doctor (AOR=0.50 [0.33–0.73]) or at walk-in medical clinics (AOR=0.54 [0.30–0.96]), and among those who had never tested for STIs previously (AOR=0.17 [0.06–0.39]).ConclusionAlmost 40% of gbMSM in our sample were aware of GetCheckedOnline. Increasing promotion to gbMSM who are not out to their healthcare provider, who have never tested previously for STIs, or who are less connected to LGBTQ2S+ communities may improve program reach.","Ablona, A.; Montiel, A.; Klassen, B.; Card, K.; Iyamu, I.; Chang, H.; Haag, D.; Korol, E.; Bannar-Martin, S.; Brennan, D.; Grace, D.; Worthington, C.; Lachowsky, N.; Gilbert, M.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,5,12

Severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), mainly caused by influenza, are a leading cause of hospitalisation and mortality. Increasing evidence indicates that non-influenza respiratory viruses (NIRVs) also contribute to the burden of SARI. In Belgium, SARI surveillance by a network of sentinel hospitals is ongoing since 2011. AIM: Here, we report the results of using in-house multiplex PCRs for the detection of a flexible panel of viruses in respiratory ILI and SARI samples and the estimated incidence rates of SARI associated to each virus. METHODS: ILI was defined as an infection with onset of fever and cough or dyspnoea. SARI was defined as an infection requiring hospitalization with onset of fever and cough or dyspnoea within the previous 10 days. Samples were collected during four winter seasons and tested by multiplex RT-qPCRs for influenza virus and NIRVs. Using catchment population estimates, incidence rates of SARI associated to each virus were calculated. RESULTS: One third of the SARI cases were positive for NIRVs, reaching 49.4% among children under fifteen. In children under five, incidence rates of NIRV-associated SARI were double that of influenza (103.4 versus 57.6 per 100000 person-months), with NIRV co-infections, respiratory syncytial viruses, human metapneumoviruses and picornaviruses contributing the most (33.1, 13.6, 15.8 and 18.2 per 100000 person-months, respectively). CONCLUSION: Early testing for NIRVs could be beneficial to clinical management of SARI patients, especially in children under five, for whom the burden of NIRV-associated disease exceeds that of influenza.","Subissi, L.; Bossuyt, N.; Reynders, M.; Gerard, M.; Dauby, N.; Lacor, P.; Daelemans, S.; Lissoir, B.; Holemans, X.; Magerman, K.; Jouck, D.; Bourgeois, M.; Delaere, B.; Quoilin, S.; Van Gucht, S.; Thomas, I.; Barbezange, C.",,5,1

In the context of the growing epidemic of the new coronavirus infection COVID-19, the Russian health system, for the first time in recent history, faced the need for large-scale mobilization and conversion of many existing hospitals into infectious diseases hospitals. At the same time, the composition of hospitalized patients has not been studied, and the availability of data on it is crucial for the organization and planning of medical care. Purpose of study. To study the composition of hospitalized patients with a new coronavirus infection COVID-19 from the point of view of their age, gender, the severity of the condition, the presence of pneumonia and concomitant diseases to optimize the planning and objectification of the assessment of the need for medical care in a hospital setting. Material and methods. The data was studied, and the analysis of hospitalizations of 1037 patients in the country’s largest repurposed infectious hospital for the treatment of patients with the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 was carried out. Results. For the first time analyzed the main regularities of the formation of hospitalized patients, which characterize features of the disease and have a high prognostic value both from the point of view of organization of specialized medical care in stationary conditions and assess the need for diagnostic and diagnostic and treatment activities and their resource provision. It is established that adult patients of almost all age groups receive medical care in a hospital setting, but as the age increases, the need for hospitalization tends to increase. Conclusions. The severity of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is determined by their age and the presence of concomitant pathology, which is of important prognostic value from the point of view of optimal planning of this type of medical care. © 2021 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina.

Broad sampling has revealed the importance of bats in the diversification and spread of viruses and eukaryotes to other animal hosts. Vector-borne bacteria of the genus Bartonella are prevalent and diverse in mammals globally and recent surveys have revealed numerous Bartonella lineages in bats. We assembled a sequence database of Bartonella strains, consisting of nine genetic loci from 209 previously characterized lineages and 121 new cultured strains from bats, and used these data to perform the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Bartonella to date. This analysis included estimation of divergence dates using a molecular clock and ancestral reconstruction of host associations and geography. We estimate that Bartonella began infecting mammals 62 million years ago near the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Additionally, the radiation of particular Bartonella clades correlate strongly to the timing of diversification and biogeography of mammalian hosts. Bats were inferred to be the ancestral hosts of all mammal-associated Bartonella and appear to be responsible for the early geographic expansion of the genus. We conclude that bats have had a deep influence on the evolutionary radiation of Bartonella bacteria and their spread to other mammalian orders. These results support a ‘bat seeding’ hypothesis that could explain similar evolutionary patterns in other mammalian parasite taxa. Application of such phylogenetic tools as we have used to other taxa may reveal the general importance of bats in the ancient diversification of mammalian parasites. Significance statement Discovering the evolutionary history of infectious agents in animals is important for understanding the process of host adaptation and the origins of human diseases. To clarify the evolution of the Bartonella genus, which contains important human pathogens, we performed phylogenetic analysis on a broad diversity of Bartonella strains, including novel strains from bats. Our results indicate that Bartonella clades diversified along with their mammal hosts over millions of years. Bats appear to be especially important in the early radiation and geographic dispersal of Bartonella lineages. These patterns are consistent with research indicating a chiropteran origin of important human viruses and eukaryotic parasites, suggesting that bats may play a unique role as historical sources of infections to other hosts.","McKee, Clifton D.; Bai, Ying; Webb, Colleen T.; Kosoy, Michael Y.",bioRxiv,5,1

Because of COVID-19, the government scaled down its operations, limiting access to public services, including among migrants. Design/methodology/approach Because of COVID-19-related restrictions, a systematic review was conducted of the relevant academic literature as well as the information portals of relevant government departments, municipalities and research reports on migration and refugees in South Africa. A total of 320 peer-reviewed research articles were identified. These were filtered and 68 relevant articles were selected. Findings The study found that asylum seekers have limited access to public services via information communication technology-enabled mechanisms. Whilst the city government has embraced e-governance, it is still in its nascent stages. Research limitations/implications This study was limited to a desktop one because of COVID-19 restrictions and it focused exclusively on asylum seekers. Therefore, its findings can only be generalised to this category of people. Practical implications Future studies on this subject should gather data from all categories of migrants to gain in-depth perspectives. Social implications All spheres of governance in South Africa should recognise asylum seekers as a constituency that deserves access to public services. E-governance can facilitate easier access to these services, and policies need to be aligned with this reality. Originality/value This study examined the efficacy of e-governance in enabling access to government services by asylum seekers during COVID-19.

The existing POI recommendation systems require raw check-in history of users, which might cause location privacy violations. Although there have been several matrix factorization (MF) based privacy-preserving recommendation systems, they can only focus on user-POI relationships without considering the human movements in check-in history. To tackle this problem, we design a successive POI recommendation framework with local differential privacy, named SPIREL. SPIREL uses two types of information derived from the check-in history as input for the factorization: a transition pattern between two POIs and the visit counts of POIs. We propose a novel objective function for learning the user-POI and POI-POI relationships simultaneously. We further integrate local differential privacy mechanisms in our proposed framework to prevent potential location privacy breaches. Experiments using four public datasets demonstrate that SPIREL achieves better POI recommendation quality while accomplishing stronger privacy protection.","Kim, Jong Seon; Kim, Jong Wook; Chung, Yon Dohn",,5,16

This study examined current clinical trial reporting and transparent research practices in sports medicine and orthopedics. Methods: The sample included clinical trials published in the top 25% of sports medicine and orthopedics journals over eight months. Two independent reviewers assessed pre-registration, open data and criteria related to scientific rigor, the study sample, and data analysis. Results: The sample included 163 clinical trials from 27 journals. While the majority of trials mentioned rigor criteria, essential details were often missing. Sixty percent (confidence interval [CI] 53-68%) of trials reported sample size calculations, but only 32% (CI 25-39%) justified the expected effect size. Few trials indicated the blinding status of all main stakeholders (4%; CI 1-7%). Only 18% (CI 12-24%) included information on randomization type, method, and concealed allocation. Most trials reported participants' sex/gender (95%; CI 92-98%) and information on inclusion and exclusion criteria (78%; CI 72-84%). Only 20% (CI 14-26%) of trials were pre-registered. No trials deposited data in open repositories. Conclusions: These results will aid the sports medicine and orthopedics community in developing tailored interventions to improve reporting.

Modifications such as mask braces, earloop straps, knotting and tucking, and double masking have been proposed to improve mask fit however the data on source control are limited. METHODS The effectiveness of mask fit modifications was determined by conducting fit tests on human subjects and simulator manikins and by performing simulated coughs and exhalations using a source control measurement system. RESULTS Medical masks without modification blocked [≥]56% of cough aerosols and [≥]42% of exhaled aerosols. Modifying fit by crossing the earloops or placing a bracket under the mask did not increase performance, while using earloop toggles, an earloop strap, and knotting and tucking the mask increased performance. The most effective modifications for improving source control performance were double masking and using a mask brace. Placing a cloth mask over a medical mask blocked [≥]85% of cough aerosols and [≥]91% of exhaled aerosols.

This work investigates the extension of those results to the prediction of relative performance of athletes running on flat, hilly, or very mountainous outdoor courses. Publicly available race results in the Los Angeles area provided a set of 109,000 times, with 2200 runners participating in more than one race, so that their times could be compared under different conditions. I compare with the results of a traditional model in which the only parameters considered are total distance and elevation gain. Both the treadmill-based model and the gain-based model have some shortcomings, leading to the creation of a hybrid model that combines the best features of each. Author summary Running a race on a road allows absolute measures of performance. Trail running, however, has traditionally been thought of as a sport in which the only valid comparison is between different runners competing on the same course on the same day. Even the exact measurement of distance is considered to be unimportant, since courses and conditions vary so much. An extreme example is the relatively new genre of “vertical” races, in which runners race up a mountain. In a typical example, the competitors cover a horizontal distance of 5 km, while clibing about 1000 m. The winner in one such race had a time almost triple that expected for a state-champion high school runner in a 5k road race. Clearly no comparison can be made here without taking into account the amount of climbing. In noncompetitive contexts, many runners venture onto mountain trails, lightly dressed and with little equipment, so that it becomes important to be able to anticipate whether they will have the endurance needed to be able to safely complete a planned route. Again, this is impossible without some model of the effect of hill climbing.","Crowell, B.",bioRxiv,5,19

Methods: cross-sectional study conducted with Brazilians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collection was performed via an online electronic form containing self-reported sociodemographic and mental health variables using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) using the snow-ball sampling technique. For the whole study, a significance level of 0.05 was considered, except for the application of the stepwise method, which considered a level of 0.2. Results: 1,775 people responded the survey, mostly women (78.07%), white (58.13%), single (45.78%), currently working (63.74%). 32.03% received psychotherapy or some type of emotional support before the pandemic, 19.03% had some psychiatric diagnosis and 8.49% started some support after the beginning of the pandemic. The mean scores investigated by the DASS-21 scale were 5.53869 for depression, 4.467334 for anxiety and 8.221202 for stress. Conclusions: during the COVID-19 pandemic, sociodemographic and mental health characteristics were mapped and in Brazilians and the symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress were identified mainly in women, single people, who did not currently work and already had some previous mental health symptom.","Barbosa, Leopoldo Nelson Fernandes; Melo, Monica Cristina Batista de; Cunha, Maria do Carmo Vieira da; Albuquerque, Eliane Nóbrega; Costa, Juliana Monteiro; Silva, Eduardo Falcão Felisberto da",Rev.

When plants were inoculated with TCV, sat-RNA D and in vitro sat-RNA C transcripts containing non-viable mutations in the 5' domain, recombinant sat-RNAs were recovered. These recombinants were composed of sat-RNA D at the 5' end and sat-RNA C sequences at the 3' end. Analysis of 20 independent recombination junctions revealed that unequal crossing-over had occurred in planta in a region of sequence similarity between the two sat-RNAs which resulted in the duplication of 3-16 nucleotides. Thirty percent of the sat-RNA recombinants also had one to three additional nucleotides inserted at the crossover junctions which did not correspond to either sat-RNA C or sat-RNA D sequence. The right side of the recombination junctions always began with one of three consecutive nucleotides of sat-RNA C. Based on the similarity between this sequence of sat-RNA C, the right side junction of DI RNA G and the 5' end of TCV, as well as the sequence similarity between right side junctions of DI1 RNA and sat-RNA C and the 5' end of the sat-RNAs, a replicase-driven copy choice mechanism is proposed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Cascone, P J; Carpenter, C D; Li, X H; Simon, A E",EMBO J,5,28

It has resulted in a pandemic with increasing spread of the virus in the U.S. The county health departments around U.S. are spearheading the response to contain the spread of this virus. METHODS: This project was a survey of county health departments in the state of Kansas with data collection period from April 15 to April 24, 2020. This study evaluated the staffing, resources, and funding of these health departments and how it was affecting the efforts to contain COVID-19. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the responses. RESULTS: A total of 75% of the county health departments in Kansas responded to the survey. In 89% of locations, the staffing had not increased. Most health departments had an average of five people and the four largest ones had 30 to 98 staff working on COVID-19. Most locations used the Kansas Department of Health and Environment criteria for testing and used a combination of state or private laboratories. The results of the tests were available three days or longer in 62% and after five days in 14% of sites. All locations were active in contact tracing, but most had one to three people for this purpose and in 90% the contact tracing interview was via phone calls. There was no change in funding in 21% and decreased funding in 8.5% of health departments. Most locations had an average of five nasopharyngeal swabs on the day of the survey. The most common needs expressed were help to increase testing capability, more public education, more personal protective equipment, increased personnel, and assistance with contract tracing. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need in Kansas to increase support to county health departments for testing capability, personal protective equipment, increased number of staff, increased help with contact tracing, and especially increase support for public education.","Raghuveer, Talkad S.; Zackula, Rosey E.; Wittler, Robert R.",Kans J Med,5,8

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 25 Candida spp. isolated from hospitalized patients with COVID-19, who were suspected to have pulmonary candidiasis, and 26 archived Candida spp. specimens were enrolled in this study. For the identification of Candida spp., PCR was performed to detect and amplify the ITS1 and ITS4 genes. Then the products were subjected to the Msp I restriction enzyme to precisely identify the species. The amplification of the WHP1 gene was conducted to identify Candida albicans species. The antifungal activities of routine drugs and the synthesize AuNPs against Candida spp. were assessed based on the protocols presented by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M60. RESULTS: In the present study, C. albicans (24; 96%) and C. parapsilosis (1; 4%) were identified as the etiologic agents of the pulmonary candidiasis associated with the COVID-19 infection. Voriconazol and amphotericin B had superior activity against all the isolates in this study. Treatment with fluconazole and itraconazole did not significantly change the formation of colony-forming units (CFU). However, treatment with the AuNPs significantly decreased (within the range of 92–99.1%; P<0.05) the number of CFUs. CONCLUSION: The azole prophylaxis has likely been associated with the development of resistant isolates; the results of the present study suggested the promising role of novel antifungal agents such as AuNPs in overcoming drug resistant fungi.","Shirvani, Fariba; Fattahi, Azam",Tanaffos,5,1

Therefore, in this study, we conducted a comprehensive literature search with the aim of systematically investigating the impacts of HTP on OOP and CHE after the implementation of the plan. Method: Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Iranian bibliographic thesauri and repositories such as MagIran, Elmnet, and Scientific Information Database were searched. Studies published between May 2014 and December 2020 that reported the impact of HTP on the financial indicators under investigation in this study (OOP and CHEs) that were conducted in Iran. Estimated pooled change both for OOP and CHEs was calculated as effect size utilizing meta-analytical techniques. Also, heterogeneity among studies was assessed with the I(2) statistics. Results: Seventeen studies were included, nine of which evaluated the OOP index, six studies assessed the CHEs index, and two studies examined both the OOP and CHEs indexes. The OOP was found to decrease after the implementation of the HTP (with an estimated decrease of 13.02% (95% CI: 9.09-16.94). Also, CHEs experienced a decrease of 5.80% (95% CI: 3.85-7.74). Conclusion: The findings show that the implementation of HTP has reduced health costs. In this regard and in order to keep reducing the costs that many people are unable to pay, the government and other organizations involved in the health system should provide sustainable financial resources in order to continue running HTP. However, there remain gaps and weaknesses that can be solved through discussion with all the actors involved.","Darvishi, Banafshe; Behzadifar, Masoud; Ghanbari, Mahboubeh Khaton; Ehsanzadeh, Seyed Jafar; Bakhtiari, Ahad; Behzadifar, Meysam; Azari, Samad; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi",Yale J Biol Med,5,30

METHODS Based on the registration data of pediatric outpatient visits in the information system (HIS)of Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, from January 1 2018 to December 31 2020, aged 0 to 16 years, we analyzed the changes of outpatient visits before and after the epidemic, focusing on respiratory infection including influenza. The relationship between the outpatient visits and age and quarterly distribution were also studied. RESULTS (1) Respiratory infection accounted for the majority of outpatient visits in 2018 and 2019 (60.6% and 60.5%, respectively). Non-respiratory infection accounted for the main proportion of outpatient visits in 2020, while respiratory infection accounted for only 47.4%. Annual respiratory infection visits, respiratory infectious diseases visits especially influenza visits all decreased significantly in 2020 compared with that in 2018 and 2019 (P < 0.05). (2)Respiratory infection visits were highest in the infant group, lowest in the school age group (P < 0.05) and highest in the fourth quarter each year. It decreased significantly in the second quarter of 2020 with statistical significance when compared with the other quarters of 2020(P < 0.05). (3)Influenza accounted for the highest proportion of respiratory infectious diseases visits in each year. It was highest in first quarter, which was significantly different from the other quarters of the year (P < 0.05). There were different distributions of influenza visits throughout 2018 and 2019, while it was only distributed in the first quarter and 99% in January in 2020. CONCLUSION The respiratory infection and influenza visits have decreased significantly in our pediatric outpatient department after the COVID-19 epidemic, which is considered closely related to the lifestyle and personal protection after the epidemic. It is recommended that health education on respiratory infection and influenza prevention should be strengthened, especially in winter and spring, to promote the development of good respiratory and hand hygiene habits.","Meng, H; Ji, L N; Huang, J; Chao, S; Zhou, J W; Li, X J; Yin, X M; Fan, L R",Beijing da xue xue bao.

The patients were randomized into two groups, A and B, and received Levofloxacin and Prednisone. Moreover, using a nebulizer ampoule for nasal douche, Group A received high molecular weight Sodium Hyaluronate (3%) plus saline solution (NaCl 0.9%) twice a day for 30 days; Group B received saline solution twice a day for 30 days. RESULTS At T0 only the VAS score showed differences regarding nasal discharge and post-nasal drip. At T1, in Group A MCTt and the number of bacteria were significantly lower than in Group B. The VAS score showed improvement in Group A. At T2 in Group A, MCTt and number of neutrophils were significantly lower than in Group B. The VAS score showed statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding nasal discharge. CONCLUSIONS In ARS patients sodium hyaluronate plus saline solution significantly improved symptoms, MCT time and reduced neutrophil count on nasal cytology.","Ciofalo, A; Zambetti, G; Altissimi, G; Fusconi, M; Soldo, P; Gelardi, M; Iannella, G; Pasquariello, B; Magliulo, G",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,5,16

However, it was not until 1998 that the ancestral mother of p53 was documented. The eldest evolutionary conserved homolog of the p53 family is known today as p63. Originally, it was thought p63 was another tumor suppressor that could function in a similar capacity to p53. However, elegant demonstrations of the divergent roles that p63 plays as a key transcriptional regulator of the proliferation and differentiation cascade in stratified epithelia are documented. These data link deltaNp63alpha to adult tissue stem cell regulation and possibly ""cancer stem cells"". p63 lacks mutation in cancer development, which is in stark contrast to the classically high mutation status of p53 in a large compendium of cancer types. Perhaps suggesting a selective preference for p53 mutation. Why is p63 rarely mutated despite being part of the same gene family? Interestingly, p63 is often over-expressed and amplified in cancer, thus revealing a paradox. Is p63 required to provide cancer cell populations with a selective advantage as much as a loss of p53 function by mutation? Has p53 been masking a ""phantom"" with promising features as a target for drug development? Can we exploit the biochemical know how gained from the mass of p53 research to further elucidate deltaNp63alpha gene function? In this review, we will summarise the emerging advances that are elucidating deltaNp63alpha as a promising drug target.","Finlan, Lee E; Hupp, Ted R",Cell cycle,5,1

The fieldwork was conducted in the fall of 2005 between hurricane Katrina and the South Asia earthquake. These tragedies, shown on 24/7 television news channels, provided an eyewitness account of disaster management, or lack of it, in our global village world. It is not enough to just have best practices in place. There has to be a governance structure that can be held accountable. This review of best practices lists actions in support of an emergency preparedness culture at the management, executive, and corporate/governance levels of the organization. The methodology adopted a future quality management approach of the emergency management process to identify the corresponding performance indictors that correlated with practices or sets of practices. Identifying best practice performance indictors needed to conduct a future quality management audit is described as reverse quality management. Best practices cannot be assessed as stand-alone criteria; they are influenced by organizational culture. The defining of best practices was influenced by doubt about defining a practice it is hoped will never be performed, medical staff involvement, leadership, and an appreciation of the resources required and how they need to be managed. Best practice benchmarks are seen as being related more to ""measures"" of performance defined locally and agreed on by 2 or more parties rather than to achieving industrial standards. Relating practices to performance indicators and then to benchmarks resulted in the development of a Health Emergency Management Best Practices Matrix that lists specific practice in the different phases of emergency management.","Lynch, Tim; Cox, Paul",Quality management in health care,5,19

When macrophages are stimulated with an endotoxin, they produce a factor or factors, termed cachectin, that inhibits the activity of fat-producing (lipogenic) enzymes in cultured adipocytes. This effect may reflect one of the physiological bases for cachexia. In the present study, clones of complementary DNA from genes whose expression is increased during the differentiation of adipocytes were used to study the molecular basis of cachectin's actions. In the presence of cachectin, the expression of the corresponding genes was reversibly and specifically inhibited. Furthermore, when mature adipocytes were exposed to cachectin, the messenger RNA's of those genes diminished and rapidly approached the levels present before differentiation.","Torti, F M; Dieckmann, B; Beutler, B; Cerami, A; Ringold, G M",Science,5,20

We have reported recently that the nucleocapsid (N) protein from strains of murine hepatitis virus (MHV-3, MHV-A59), which cause massive hepatocellular necrosis but not from strains (MHV-JHM, MHV-2) which do not produce serious liver disease, induces transcription of fgl2. The purpose of the present study was to characterize both viral and host factor(s) necessary for viral induced transcription of fgl2. Mutation of residues Gly-12, Pro-38, Asn-40, Gln-41, and Asn-42 within domain 1 of the N protein of MHV-A59 to their corresponding residues found in MHV-2 abrogated fgl2 transcription, whereas mutation of other N protein domains, including a protein expressed from an internal reading frame (I protein), did not affect fgl2 gene transcription. We then examined the -372 to -306 sequence within the 1.3-kb fgl2 promoter region upstream from the transcription start site that was previously identified as necessary for N protein-induced gene transcription. We demonstrated that the -331/-325 HNF4 cis-element and its cognate transcription factor, HNF4alpha, are necessary for virus-induced fgl2 gene transcription. In uninfected macrophages and macrophages infected with MHV-2, an unidentified protein occupies the HNF4 cis-element. Following stimulation with MHV-A59, it was shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay that HNF4alpha binds the HNF4 cis-element in the fgl2 promoter. We further report the unprecedented presence of HNF4alpha in peritoneal macrophages. Collectively, the results of this study define both viral and host factors necessary for induction of fgl2 prothrombinase gene transcription in MHV infection and may provide an explanation for the hepatotrophic nature of MHV-induced fulminant hepatic failure.","Ning, Qin; Lakatoo, Sophia; Liu, Mingfeng; Yang, Weiming; Wang, Zhimo; Phillips, M James; Levy, Gary A",The Journal of biological chemistry,5,15

Known risk factors for road traffic crashes and related injuries and deaths include speed, alcohol, nonuse of restraints, and nonuse of helmets. More recently, driver distraction has become an emerging concern. To assess the prevalence of mobile device use while driving in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States, CDC analyzed data from the 2011 EuroPNStyles and HealthStyles surveys. Prevalence estimates for self-reported talking on a cell phone while driving and reading or sending text or e-mail messages while driving were calculated. This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that, among drivers ages 18-64 years, the prevalence of talking on a cell phone while driving at least once in the past 30 days ranged from 21% in the UK to 69% in the United States, and the prevalence of drivers who had read or sent text or e-mail messages while driving at least once in the past 30 days ranged from 15% in Spain to 31% in Portugal and the United States. Lessons learned from successful road safety efforts aimed at reducing other risky driving behaviors, such as seat belt nonuse and alcohol-impaired driving, could be helpful to the United States and other countries in addressing this issue.

METHODS Thirty SARS patients were treated at our hospital for over 3 weeks since March to May 2003. The course and dosage of glucocorticoid, counts of CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+) and CD(3)(+), electrolytes, blood routine, and sera albumin before and after the treatment were analysed. RESULTS Before treatment by methylprednisolone, the counts of CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+) and CD(3)(+) of 27 SARS patients were (401 +/- 203), (340 +/- 187), (756 +/- 383) cells/ microl. Twenty-nine of the 30 SARS patients were treated by methylprednisolone. The dosage for 24 patients was 80 - 160 mg/d with the largest being 1,000 mg/d before admission to the hospital. The count of WBC was increased after treatment (P < 0.01). No obvious effect was observed on the potassium, sodium and chlorine of blood (P > 0.05). Glucocorticoid increased the level of blood glucose (P = 0.01), decreased the level of sera albumin (P < 0.01), and its large dosage decreased the counts of CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+) and CD(3)(+). Three severe patients had secondary infection after administration of a large dose of glucocorticoid. CONCLUSIONS In the early stage of the disease, the counts of CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+) and CD(3)(+) of SARS patients may reduce markedly indicating the immunity is suppressed. A large dose of glucocorticoid may aggravate the suppression and make the body in an active metabolic state (the increase of blood glucose and the decrease of sera albumin). Thus the disease is aggravated and patients are likely to suffer from severe secondary infection. Indications for use of glucocorticoid must strictly controlled and its large dosage is improper.","Li, Xing-wang; Jiang, Rong-meng; Guo, Jia-zhen",Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,5,1

In contrast to FPLV, CPV has evolved rapidly since its emergence. The original antigenic type of CPV disappeared more than two decades ago and several new antigenic as well as genetic CPV variants have appeared and spread in the field. Both high mutation rate and positive selection of mutations in the capsid gene appear to be the driving force for such rapid evolution. In addition, genetic recombination has been assessed as a factor in parvovirus evolution. Recently, we provided the first evidence of inter-antigenic type recombination of CPV in nature. Here, an inter-FPV subspecies recombinant was revealed by analyzing the genetic data deposited in databases with several recombination detection programs, and by phylogeny. FPLV strain XJ-1, submitted by Su et al., Harbin, China in 2007 (GenBank accession no. EF988660), was most likely generated by recombination between CPV and FPLV. Its genome was generally composed of the NS1 gene of CPV origin and the VP1 gene of FPLV origin. This is the first demonstration of recombination between different FPV subspecies in nature. Consequently, recombination should be considered as an element in the generation and evolution of parvoviruses of the FPV subspecies.","Ohshima, Takahisa; Mochizuki, Masami",The Journal of veterinary medical science,5,23

As pH in the medium was reduced from 7.5 to 4.5, the association of virus to the cells was nearly doubled. The same effect of pH was observed when fusion between ISAV and liposomes was analyzed. In addition, the binding of ISAV to intact SHK-1 cells and to cell membrane proteins blotted onto filters was neuraminidase sensitive. However, the increased binding induced by low pH was not neuraminidase sensitive, probably reflecting activation of a fusion peptide at low pH. By using confocal fluorescence microscopy, the increased fusion of fluorescently labelled ISAV with the plasma membrane due to low pH could be demonstrated. When vacuolar pH in the cells was raised during inoculation with chloroquine or ammonium chloride, both electron and confocal microscopy showed accumulation of ISAV in endosomes and lysosomes. Production of infectious virus could be increased by lowering the extracellular pH during infection. Furthermore, chloroquine present during virus inoculation also caused a reduction in the synthesis of viral proteins in ISAV-infected cells as well as in the production of infective virus. These results indicate that ISAV binds to sialic acid residues on the cell surface and that the fusion between virus and cell membrane takes place in the acid environment of endosomes. This provides further evidence for a high degree of similarity between ISAV and influenza virus and extends the basis for the classification of this virus as a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family.","Eliassen, T M; Frøystad, M K; Dannevig, B H; Jankowska, M; Brech, A; Falk, K; Romøren, K; Gjøen, T",Journal of virology,5,1

Here, we describe evidence that stem-loop IV, a bulged stem-loop mapping at nt 186 through 215, (i) is phylogenetically conserved among group 2 coronaviruses and may have a homolog in groups 1 and 3, (ii) exists as a higher-order structure on the basis of enzyme probing, (iii) is required as a higher-order element for replication of a BCoV defective interfering (DI) RNA in the positive but not the negative strand, and (iv) as a higher-order structure in wild-type (wt) and mutant molecules that replicate, specifically binds six cellular proteins in the molecular mass range of 25 to 58 kDa as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift and UV cross-linking assays; binding to viral proteins was not detected. Interestingly, the predicted stem-loop IV homolog in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus appears to be group 1-like in that it is in part duplicated with a group 1-like conserved loop sequence and is not group 2-like, as would be expected by the SARS coronavirus group 2-like 3' UTR structure. These results together indicate that stem-loop IV in the BCoV 5' UTR is a cis-acting element for DI RNA replication and that it might function through interactions with cellular proteins. It is postulated that stem-loop IV functions similarly in the virus genome.","Raman, Sharmila; Brian, David A",Journal of virology,5,24

In recent years, healthcare systems have experienced shortages of RPDs during outbreaks of infectious diseases, in part due to a lack of information about their availability. New tools to track RPD inventories may improve accessibility during an emergency. Investigators at Vanderbilt University have identified four major themes that influence RPD use for infection prevention: hospital preparedness, responsiveness to airborne pathogens, potential exposure outcomes, and infection control practices related to respirator effectiveness. Based on these findings, an RPD surveillance tool (RST) was developed to collect and share near real-time data about RPD supplies in healthcare facilities. The objective of this study was to conduct a feasibility assessment of this RST. Methods The new online surveillance tool was implemented at four large, urban, acute care U.S. hospitals in January 2014; data was collected about RPD inventory, tracking systems, hospital characteristics, and utility of gathered information. Results The RST was implemented successfully and without difficulty at hospitals that had 78 to 90 percent occupancy rates. Participating hospitals reported that the RST (1) provided value for benchmarking their RPD supply, (2) promoted understanding about RPD accessibility among hospital systems engaged in infection control, and (3) served as a means to assess RPD program quality. Conclusion Implementation of this newly developed RST is feasible and appears to have utility in U.S. hospitals for tracking and understanding RPD use for routine healthcare delivery and public health emergencies.","Wizner, Kerri; Radonovich, Lewis; Bell, Allie; Oke, Charles; Yarbrough, Mary",Journal of the International Society for Respiratory Protection,5,1
188418,188418,188418,Isolation and characterization of new infectious bronchitis virus variants in Hungary.,9.334349,6.417114,1990,"Background: Despite the known importance of breastfeeding for women's and children's health, global exclusive prevalence among infants under 6 months old is estimated at only 41%. In 2018, Indonesia had a lower exclusive breastfeeding rate of 37% at 6 months postpartum; ranging from 20% to 56%, showing unequal breastfeeding support throughout the country. The World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding (Ten Steps) in 1989, later embedded in UNICEF's Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) program in 1991. The BFHI aims to encourage maternity facilities worldwide to ensure adequate education and support for breastfeeding mothers by adhering to the Ten Steps and complying with the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes. An Indonesian survey in 2011 found that less than one in 10 government hospitals implemented the Ten Steps. It has been common for Indonesian health services to collaborate with infant formula companies. While no Indonesian hospitals are currently BFHI-accredited, the WHO/UNICEF Ten Steps (updated in 2018) have been adopted in Indonesia's national regulation of maternity facilities since 2012. Internationally, implementation of the Ten Steps individually and as a package has been associated with benefits to breastfeeding rates and maternal and infant health. However, to date, few studies have examined the impact of implementing the Ten Steps in economic terms. This study aims to measure the economic benefit of Ten Steps implementation in an Indonesian hospital. Methods: The study was conducted in January 2020 in Airlangga University Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia, which has implemented the Ten Steps since it was established in 2012. To understand and generate evidence on the social value of the Ten Steps, we conducted a ""Social Return on Investment (SROI)"" study of implementing the Ten Steps in this maternity facility. To estimate the costs relating to the Ten Steps we interviewed the financial and nursing managers, a senior pediatrician, and senior midwife due to their detailed understanding of the implementation of the Ten Steps in the hospital. The interview was guided by a questionnaire which we developed based on the 2018 WHO/UNICEF Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. The analysis was supported with peer-reviewed literature on the benefits of Ten Steps breastfeeding outcomes. Results: The total per annum value of investment (cost) required to implement Ten Steps in Airlangga University Hospital was US$ 972,303. The estimate yearly benefit was US$ 22,642,661. The social return on the investment in implementing Ten Steps in this facility was calculated to be US$ 49 (sensitivity analysis: US$ 18-65). Thus, for every US$ 1 invested in Ten Steps implementation by Airlangga Hospital could be expected to generate approximately US$ 49 of benefit. Conclusions: Investment in the Ten Steps implementation in this Surabaya maternity facility produced a social value 49 times greater than the cost of investment. This provides novel evidence of breastfeeding as a public health tool, demonstrating the value of the investment, in terms of social impact for mothers, babies, families, communities, and countries. Breastfeeding has the potential to help address inequity throughout the lifetime by providing the equal best start to all infants regardless of their background. Indonesia's initial moves towards implementing the WHO/UNICEF Ten Steps can be strengthened by integrating all elements into the national regulation and health care system.","Pramono, Andini Y; Desborough, Jane L; Smith, Julie P; Bourke, Siobhan",The Yale journal of biology and medicine,5,25

In children, however, the size of an uncuffed ETT that can pass through the lumen of an LMA is sometimes too small for the trachea, resulting in gas leakage around the ETT. Using a cuffed ETT may reduce the gas leak but withdrawal of the LMA is then prevented by the pilot balloon. In this study, the largest sizes of cuffed and uncuffed Mallinckrodt™ ETTs that could pass with ease through various sizes of paediatric Classic™ and ProSeal™ LMAs were documented. For cuffed ETTs, withdrawal of the LMA was made possible by simply cutting off the pilot balloon. The ETT cuff-inflating mechanism was then repaired by passing a 20 or 22 gauge cannula into the cut end of the inflating tubing. The proximal end of the cannula was then connected to a one-way valve or a three-way stopcock. This technique of cutting off the pilot balloon of the cuffed ETT made it possible to use paediatric cuffed ETTs in exchange for the LMAs tested. The task was easy to perform. Subsequent repair of the cuff-inflation tubing was effective and could withstand high pressures. These findings indicate that it is possible to pass cuffed ETTs through paediatric LMA lumens, which can provide ventilation without gas leaks, unlike uncuffed ETTs.","Ho, A M H",Anaesthesia and intensive care,5,30

In this article, respirators are placeholders for similar life-saving modalities in short supply, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines and intensive care unit beds. In the article, I propose a system of triage for circumstances of scarcity of respirators. The system separates the hopeless from the curable, granting every treatable person a real chance of cure. The scarcity situation eliminates excesses of medicine, and then allocates respirators by a single scale, combining an evidence-based scoring system with risk-proportionate lottery. The triage proposed embodies continuity and consistency with the healthcare practices in ordinary times. Yet, I suggest two regulatory modifications: one in relation to expediting review of novel and makeshift solutions and the second in relation to mandatory retrospective research on all relevant medical data and standard (as opposed to experimental) interventions that are influenced by the triage.","Barilan, Yechiel Michael",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,5,16

Buckland and F. Wild, Nature [London] 338:547, 1989). To determine the role of the conserved leucines in the oligomeric structure and biological activity of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) fusion protein, the heptadic leucines at amino acids 481, 488, and 495 were changed individually and in combination to an alanine residue. While single amino acid changes had little effect on fusion, substitution of two or three leucine residues abolished the fusogenic activity of the protein, although cell surface expression of the mutants was higher than that of the wild-type protein. Substitution of all three leucine residues with alanine did not alter the size of the fusion protein oligomer as determined by sedimentation in sucrose gradients. Furthermore, deletion of the C-terminal 91 amino acids, including the leucine zipper motif and transmembrane domain, resulted in secretion of an oligomeric polypeptide. These results indicate that the conserved leucines are not necessary for oligomer formation but are required for the fusogenic ability of the protein. When the polar face of the potential alpha helix was altered by nonconservative changes of serine to alanine (position 473), glutamic acid to lysine or alanine (position 482), asparagine to lysine (position 485), or aspartic acid to alanine (position 489), the fusogenic ability of the protein was not significantly disrupted. In addition, a double mutant (E482A,D489A) which removed negative charges along one side of the helix had negligible effects on fusion activity.","Reitter, J N; Sergel, T; Morrison, T G",Journal of virology,5,1

Super spread events (SSEs) potentiate early outbreak of the disease and its constant spread in later stages. Viral recombination events within species and across hosts lead to natural selection based on advanced infectivity and resistance. In this review, the importance of containment of SSEs was investigated with emphasis on stopping COVID-19 spread and its socio-economic consequences. A comprehensive search was conducted among literature available in multiple electronic sources to find articles that addressed the ""potential role of SSEs on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) pandemic"" and were published before 20th of August 2020. Overall, ninety-eight articles were found eligible and reviewed.

The resulting cloned viral DNA fragments were mapped to viral genes by hybridization with Northern blots of intracellular RNA from mouse hepatitis virus strain A59-infected cells.

Sequencing of parts of this cloned DNA show that these three intergenic regions contain a common 11-nucleotide sequence. This sequence shares homology with the 3' end of the viral mRNA leader sequence. Thus, this common intergenic sequence may contain a binding site for a leader RNA that hybridizes to negative-strand viral RNA at the beginning of each gene to prime mRNA synthesis.

Objective Postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak is a known complication of intraoperative durotomy. Intraoperative placement of subfascial epidural drains following primary dural repair has been proposed as a potential management strategy to prevent formation of CSF cutaneous fistula and symptomatic pseudomeningocele. Here we describe our experience with subfascial drain after intentional durotomy. Methods Medical records of patients who underwent placement of subfascial epidural drains during spinal procedures with intentional intraoperative durotomies over a 4-year period at two institutions were retrospectively reviewed. Primary outcomes of interest were postoperative CSF cutaneous fistula or symptomatic pseudomeningocele formation. Results Twenty-five patients were included. Mean length of follow-up was 9.5 months. Twelve patients (48%) underwent simultaneous arthrodesis. The average duration of the drain was 5.3 days with average daily output of 126.5 mL. Subgroup analyses revealed that average drain duration for the arthrodesis group was 6.33 days, which is significantly greater than that of the nonfused group, which was 3.7 days (p = 0.016). Similarly, the average daily drain output for the arthrodesis subgroup at 153.1 mL was significantly higher than that of the nonfused subgroup (86.8 mL, p = 0.04). No patient developed postoperative CSF cutaneous fistula or symptomatic pseudomeningocele or had negative sequelae associated with overdrainage of CSF. One patient had a delayed wound infection. Conclusions The intraoperative placement of subfascial epidural drains was not associated with postoperative development of CSF cutaneous fistula, symptomatic pseudomeningocele, overdrainage, or subdural hematoma in the cases reviewed. Subfascial closed wound drain placement is a safe and efficacious management method after intentional spinal durotomies. It is particularly helpful in those who undergo simultaneous arthrodesis, as those patients have statistically higher daily drain output and longer drain durations.","Niu, Tianyi; Lu, Derek S; Yew, Andrew; Lau, Darryl; Hoffman, Haydn; McArthur, David; Chou, Dean; Lu, Daniel C",Global spine journal,5,16

Median age at HCT was 36.5 years, and median length of follow-up was 7.6 years. Overall survival was 68.8% +/- 1.8% at 10 years, and the cohort was at a 13-fold increased risk for late death (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 13.0) when compared with the general population. Mortality rates approached those of the general population after 10 years among patients at standard risk for relapse at HCT (SMR = 1.1) and in patients undergoing transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia (AML; SMR = 0.9). Relapse of primary disease (56%) and subsequent malignancies (25%) were leading causes of late death. Relapse-related mortality was increased among patients with Hodgkin disease (HD; relative risk [RR] = 3.6), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; RR = 2.1), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; RR = 6.5). Total body irradiation (RR = 0.6) provided a protective effect. Nonrelapse-related mortality was increased after carmustine (RR = 2.3) and with use of peripheral blood stem cells (RR = 2.4). Survivors were more likely to report difficulty in holding jobs (RR = 9.4) and in obtaining health (RR = 7.7) or life insurance (RR = 8.4) when compared with siblings. Although mortality rates approach that of the general population after 10 years in certain subgroups, long-term survivors of autologous HCT continue to face challenges affecting their health and well-being.","Bhatia, Smita; Robison, Leslie L; Francisco, Liton; Carter, Andrea; Liu, Yan; Grant, Marcia; Baker, K Scott; Fung, Henry; Gurney, James G; McGlave, Philip B; Nademanee, Auayporn; Ramsay, Norma K C; Stein, Anthony; Weisdorf, Daniel J; Forman, Stephen J",Blood,5,1

The serum and peritoneal fluid concentrations of AGP may be useful in the diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a lethal disease of cats. Currently AGP can be measured by radioimmunodiffusion (RID) assays, which are time consuming and difficult. OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study were to develop a rapid immunoturbidimetric assay for measurement of AGP in feline serum and peritoneal fluid and to compare the results with those obtained by RID. METHODS AGP was purified by perchloric acid precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography from a pool of peritoneal fluid obtained from cats with FIP, as determined by a panel of laboratory tests, including serum AGP concentration, albumin: globulin ratio, and total protein concentration, anti-coronavirus antibody titers, and effusion analysis. The purified AGP in a complete Freund's adjuvant and Tween 20 mixture was injected into a sheep and blood was collected at monthly intervals. Anti-AGP antiserum, as confirmed by ELISA and Western blot techniques, and a pool of peritoneal fluid from cats with FIP were used to prepare standards. Clinical samples of feline peritoneal fluid (n=55) and serum (n=59) were assayed for AGP and results from the immunoturbidimetric and RID methods were compared. RESULTS Significant correlation (P < .001) was obtained between methods for both peritoneal fluid (R2=.9259) and serum (R2=.9448) samples. Coefficients of variation for the immunoturbidimetric method were <5%. CONCLUSIONS This rapid immunoturbidimetric assay for measurement of feline AGP in serum and peritoneal fluid may be of value in the diagnosis of FIP and possibly other inflammatory diseases in cats.","Bence, Laura M; Addie, Diane D; Eckersall, P David",Veterinary clinical pathology,5,33

While the coronaviruses in these species have all been in coronavirus Group 3, as for the better known coronaviruses of the domestic fowl (infectious bronchitis virus [IBV], in Gallus gallus), turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), there is experimental evidence to suggest that birds are not limited to infection with Group 3 coronaviruses. In China coronaviruses have been isolated from peafowl (Pavo), guinea fowl (Numida meleagris; also isolated in Brazil), partridge (Alectoris) and also from a non-gallinaceous bird, the teal (Anas), all of which were being reared in the vicinity of domestic fowl. These viruses were closely related in genome organization and in gene sequences to IBV. Indeed, gene sequencing and experimental infection of chickens indicated that the peafowl isolate was the H120 IB vaccine strain, while the teal isolate was possibly a field strain of a nephropathogenic IBV. Thus the host range of IBV does extend beyond the chicken. Most recently, Group 3 coronaviruses have been detected in greylag goose (Anser anser), mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and pigeon (Columbia livia). It is clear from the partial genome sequencing of these viruses that they are not IBV, as they have two additional small genes near the 3' end of the genome. Twenty years ago a coronavirus was isolated after inoculation of mice with tissue from the coastal shearwater (Puffinus puffinus). While it is not certain whether the virus was actually from the shearwater or from the mice, recent experiments have shown that bovine coronavirus (a Group 2 coronavirus) can infect and also cause enteric disease in turkeys. Experiments with some Group 1 coronaviruses (all from mammals, to date) have shown that they are not limited to replicating or causing disease in a single host. SARS-coronavirus has a wide host range. Clearly there is the potential for the emergence of new coronavirus diseases in domestic birds, from both avian and mammalian sources. Modest sequence conservation within gene 1 has enabled the design of oligonucleotide primers for use in diagnostic reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions, which will be useful for the detection of new coronaviruses.","Cavanagh, Dave",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,5,28

Examination of a range of doses of IFN (1 to 1000 IU) showed that 10 IU administered daily for 1 week prior to virus infection was optimal for inhibition of MCMV replication. Furthermore, low-dose orally administered IFN (10 IU/day) was effective in mice challenged with lethal and sublethal virus inocula. The antiviral efficacy of low-dose orally administered IFN was not restricted by either the route of virus inoculation or the mouse genotype. Analysis by immunohistochemistry of IFN-alpha receptor-bearing cells of the gastrointestinal tract revealed predominant staining of perivascular smooth muscle and the lamina propria of the anterior tongue, small intestine and rectum. These tissues, dense in IFN-alpha receptor-bearing cells, are likely to be the sites of interaction of the orally administered IFNs with the mucosal immune system.

METHODS Flow cytometry was applied to study the dynamic alteration of the number and frequencies in circulating DC cell subsets in 30 SARS patients including critical SARS (n = 11) and general SARS (n = 19). The reasons and clinic significances of the peripheral blood DC subsets changes in SARS patients were also analyzed in our study. RESULTS The patients in critical status had a 9-week course of disease, longer than the 6-week course observed in subjects in general status. The frequency of peripheral DC cell subsets significantly dropped beginning from the onset of symptom in SARS patients and was maintained at significant low levels during the following 4 - 5 weeks, 1.7 +/- 1.8, 5.3 +/- 5.0/ micro l for DC1, 0.57 +/- 1.02, 0.98 +/- 1.11/ micro l for DC2 for cases in critical and general statuses, respectively, compared with healthy subjects; more importantly, the pDC2 even disappeared in the patients who died from SARS diseases. The possible reasons responsible for the alteration of DC subsets in peripheral blood is likely to be the direct attack of SARS-CoVin circulation and be partially involved the application of large dose of steroid. The frequency in DC cell subsets returned to normal level in convalescent stage. CONCLUSION Our results showed SARS patients had a significant decrease of circulating DC cell subset frequency, which maybe lead to the host immunodeficiency response to SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV).","Zhang, Zheng; Wang, Fu-sheng; Zhao, Min; Liu, Jing-chao; Xu, Dong-ping; Jin, Lei; Chen, Ju-mei; Wang, Min; Chu, Fu-liang",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,5,26

OBJECTIVES To describe the effect of the national COVID-19 lockdown in South Africa (SA) on the workload and case mix of patients presenting to a district-level emergency centre. METHODS The electronic patient tracking and registration database at Mitchells Plain Hospital, a district-level hospital in Cape Town, was retrospectively analysed. The 5-week lockdown period (27 March - 30 April 2020) was compared with a similar period immediately before the lockdown (21 February - 26 March). A comparison was also made with corresponding time periods during 2018 and 2019. Patient demographics, characteristics, diagnoses and disposition, as well as process times, were compared. RESULTS A total of 26 164 emergency centre visits were analysed (8 297 in 2020, 9 726 in 2019, 8 141 in 2018). There was a reduction of 15% in overall emergency centre visits from 2019 to 2020 (non-trauma 14%, trauma 20%). A 35% decrease was seen between the 2020 lockdown period and the 5-week period before lockdown (non-trauma 33%, trauma 43%), and the reduced number of visits stayed similar throughout the lockdown period. The median age increased by 5 years during the 2020 lockdown period, along with an 8% decrease in patients aged <12 years. High-acuity patients increased by 6% and the emergency centre mortality rate increased by 1%. All process times were shorter during the lockdown period (time to triage -24%, time to consultation -56%, time to disposition decision -29%, time in the emergency centre -20%). CONCLUSIONS The SA national COVID-19 lockdown resulted in a substantial decrease in the number of patients presenting to the emergency centre.

In the present study, our aim is to investigate the current evidence regarding central nervous system (CNS) complications in patients with confirmed COVID-19. Methods An extensive search was conducted in electronic databases including Medline (using PubMed), Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science, in addition to the manual search in Google and Google scholar search engines, for articles published from 2019 until April 21st, 2020. Inclusion criteria was articles that were reviewed and reported the incidence of neurological outcomes in patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease. Results The initial search yielded 638 records, from which 7 articles were included. Overall, the incidence of CNS complications was calculated to be 6.27% (95% CI: 3.32 to 9.98). The incidence of the most common CNS complications, encephalopathy and acute cerebrovascular disease, were 9.14% (95%CI: 2.20 to 19.81) and 2.59% (95% CI: 1.31 to 4.25), respectively. Conclusion CNS complications do exist in COVID-19 patients, encephalopathy being the most concerning one. The heterogeneity in the existing literature causes an uncertainty in reporting the definite prevalence rate for each complication. Thus, further studies are needed for scientists to reach a more accurate estimate of the prevalence of these complications in COVID-19 patients. However, healthcare providers should consider the possibility of CNS involvements in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","MadaniNeishaboori, Arian; Moshrefiaraghi, Donya; Mohamed Ali, Kosar; Toloui, Amirmohammad; Yousefifard, Mahmoud; Hosseini, Mostafa",Archives of academic emergency medicine,5,16

This study aims to investigate outcomes of such patients. The nationwide inpatient sample database was used to identify patients underwent kidney autotransplantation during 2002 to 2012. Multivariate analyses using logistic regression were performed to investigate morbidity predictors. A total of 817 patients underwent kidney autotransplantation from 2002 to 2012. The most common indication of surgery was renal artery pathology (22.7%) followed by ureter pathology (17%). Overall, 97.7 per cent of operations were performed in urban teaching hospitals. The number of procedures from 2008 to 2012 were significantly higher compared with the number of them from 2002 to 2007 (473 vs 345, P < 0.01). The overall mortality and morbidity of patients were 1.3 and 46.2 per cent, respectively. The most common postoperative complications were transplanted kidney failure (10.7%) followed by hemorrhagic complications (9.7%). Obesity [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 9.62, P < 0.01], fluid and electrolyte disorders (AOR: 3.67, P < 0.01), and preoperative chronic kidney disease (AOR: 1.80, P = 0.03) were predictors of morbidity in patients. In conclusion, Kidney autotransplantation is associated with low mortality but a high morbidity rate. The most common indications of kidney autotransplantation are renal artery and ureter pathologies, respectively. A kidney transplant failure rate of 10.7 per cent was observed in patients with kidney autotransplantation. The most common postoperative complication was hemorrhagic in nature.","Moghadamyeghaneh, Zhobin; Hanna, Mark H; Fazlalizadeh, Reza; Obi, Yoshitsugu; Foster, Clarence E; Stamos, Michael J; Ichii, Hirohito",The American surgeon,5,16

The highly conserved region at the carboxy terminus of ORF1a is processed by the nsp5 proteinase (Mpro) into mature products, including nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, and nsp10, proteins with predicted or identified activities involved in RNA synthesis. Although continuous translation and proteolytic processing of ORF1ab by Mpro is required for replication, it is unknown whether specific cleavage events within the polyprotein are dispensable. We determined the requirement for the nsp7 to nsp10 proteins and their processing during murine hepatitis virus (MHV) replication. Through use of an MHV reverse genetics system, in-frame deletions of the coding sequences for nsp7 to nsp10, or ablation of their flanking Mpro cleavage sites, were made and the effects upon replication were determined. Viable viruses were characterized by analysis of Mpro processing, RNA transcription, and growth fitness. Deletion of any of the regions encoding nsp7 to nsp10 was lethal. Disruption of the cleavage sites was lethal with the exception of that of the nsp9-nsp10 site, which resulted in a mutant virus with attenuated replication. Passage of the attenuated nsp9-nsp10 cleavage mutant increased fitness to near-wild-type kinetics without reversion to a virus capable of processing nsp9-nsp10. We also confirmed the presence of a second cleavage site between nsp7 and nsp8. In order to determine whether a distinct function could be attributed to preprocessed forms of the polyprotein, including nsp7 to nsp10, the genes encoding nsp7 and nsp8 were rearranged. The mutant virus was not viable, suggesting that the uncleaved protein may be essential for replication or proteolytic processing.","Deming, Damon J; Graham, Rachel L; Denison, Mark R; Baric, Ralph S",Journal of virology,5,33

Factors such as multifragmentation, bone loss and reabsorption of the edges of the fragments are some limiting to the restitution of the clavicular length. How much might a shortening of the collarbone affect the function of the upper limb? MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective and non-probabilistic cross-sectional study was conducted in surgically treated clavicular fracture patients. Shortening was measured in millimeters on postoperative X-Ray, dash scale was subsequently applied to determine the degree of function. RESULTS 12 patients, average age 37 ± 17.7 years. 2 women and 10 men. 5 on the right side and 7 left side. Statistical analysis was performed with Pearson correlation coefficient. Average shortening 13.32 ± 9.9 mm. Average scale of DASH 6.0 ± 3. DISCUSSION Moderate correlation with limitation in function in shortenings 1 cm, as well as clinical significance on the DASH scale from 6 points, 4 less than what the literature marks. With this, it can be determined that patients managed with or without surgery, with a shortening 1 cm will have a considerable limitation in the function of the shoulder and upper limb.","Pantaleón-Fierros, E",Acta ortopedica mexicana,5,9

After the release of the immature virus, a viral protease-mediated cleavage of the cytoplasmic tail (CT) results in the loss of 17 amino acids from the carboxy terminus and renders the envelope protein fusion competent. To investigate the role of individual amino acid residues in the CT in fusion, a series of mutations was introduced, and the effects of these mutations on glycoprotein biosynthesis and fusion were examined. Most of the alanine-scanning mutations in the CT had little effect on fusion activity. However, four amino acid substitutions (threonine 4, lysine 7, glutamine 9, and isoleucine 10) resulted in substantially increased fusogenicity, while six (leucine 2, phenylalanine 5, isoleucine 13, lysine 16, proline 17, and glycine 31) resulted in much-reduced fusion. Interestingly, the bulk of these mutations are located upstream of the CT cleavage site in a region that has the potential to form a coiled-coil in the Env trimer. Substitutions at glutamine 9 and isoleucine 10 with alanine had the most dramatic positive effect and resulted in the formation of large syncytia. Taken together, these data demonstrate that individual residues within the cytoplasmic domain of M-PMV Env can modulate, in both a positive and negative manner, biological functions that are associated with the extracellular domains of the glycoprotein complex.","Song, Chisu; Micoli, Keith; Hunter, Eric",Journal of virology,5,19

Many of these glycoproteins, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike (S) protein form trimeric units in the membrane of the native virion. There is substantial experimental and pre-clinical evidence showing that the S protein is a promising lead for vaccines and therapeutics. Previously we generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to whole inactivated SARS-CoV which neutralize the virus in vitro. Here, we define their specificity and affinity, map several of their epitopes and lastly characterise chimeric versions of them. Our data show that the neutralizing mAbs bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS S protein. Three of the chimeric mAbs retain their binding specificity while one conformational mAb, F26G19, lost its ability to bind the S protein despite high level expression. The affinity for recombinant S is maintained in all of the functional chimeric versions of the parental mAbs. Both parental mAb F26G18 and the chimeric version neutralize the TO R2 strain of SARS-CoV with essentially identical titres (2.07 and 2.47 nM, respectively). Lastly, a comparison with other neutralizing mAbs to SARS-CoV clearly shows that the dominance of a 33 amino acid residue loop of the SARS-CoV RBD is independent of repertoire, species, quaternary structure, and importantly, the technology used to derive the mAbs. In cases like this, the dominance of a compact RBD antigenic domain and the central role of the S protein in pathogenesis may inherently create immunoselection pressure on viruses to evolve more complex evasion strategies or die out of a host species. The apparent simplicity of the mechanism of SARS-CoV neutralization is in stark contrast to the complexity shown by other enveloped viruses.","Berry, Jody D; Hay, Kevin; Rini, James M; Yu, Meng; Wang, Linfa; Plummer, Francis A; Corbett, Cindi R; Andonov, Anton",mAbs,5,9

Immature intracellular virus particles are then transported through the secretory pathway and converted to their mature form by cleavage of the prM protein by the cellular protease furin. Earlier studies showed that when the prM and E proteins of tick-borne encephalitis virus are expressed together in mammalian cells, they assemble into membrane-containing, icosahedrally symmetrical recombinant subviral particles (RSPs), which are smaller than whole virions but retain functional properties and undergo cleavage maturation, yielding a mature form in which the E proteins are arranged in a regular T = 1 icosahedral lattice. In this study, we generated immature subviral particles by mutation of the furin recognition site in prM. The mutation resulted in the secretion of two distinct size classes of particles that could be separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Electron microscopy showed that the smaller particles were approximately the same size as the previously described mature RSPs, whereas the larger particles were approximately the same size as the virus. Particles of the larger size class were also detected with a wild-type construct that allowed prM cleavage, although in this case the smaller size class was far more prevalent. Subtle differences in endoglycosidase sensitivity patterns suggested that, in contrast to the small particles, the E glycoproteins in the large subviral particles and whole virions might be in nonequivalent structural environments during intracellular transport, with a portion of them inaccessible to cellular glycan processing enzymes. These proteins thus appear to have the intrinsic ability to form alternative assembly products that could provide important clues about the role of lateral envelope protein interactions in flavivirus assembly.","Allison, Steven L; Tao, Yizhi J; O'Riordain, Gabriel; Mandl, Christian W; Harrison, Stephen C; Heinz, Franz X",Journal of virology,5,9

The purpose of this study was to describe and compare women's health-promoting behaviors, particularly physical activity (PA), across these transitions. A prospective, observational design was employed to assess 243 female healthcare workers from 3 sites with regard to health-promoting behaviors, and their demographic (e.g., age, parity) and psychosocial (i.e., work-family role spillover) correlates. Forty-two participants were recruited while pregnant and re-assessed during maternity leave and upon return to work, and compared to 201 non-pregnant participants. No significant changes in health-promoting behaviors were observed from pregnancy through the postpartum. Pregnant participants reported better nutrition than comparison participants (p=.001), and were more likely to check their pulse when exercising (p=.004). During pregnancy, health-promoting behaviors were related to parental status, with first-time mothers engaging in more positive behaviors. Correlates of PA during maternity leave and return to work included family income and exercise history. Positive family-to-work spillover was significantly greater among pregnant women than among comparison participants (p<.001), and positive work-to-family spillover was related to greater PA upon return to work (p<.01). This study reveals little variability in health-promoting behaviors from the prenatal to the postpartum period. Both demographic and psychosocial factors have effects on health-promoting behaviors, and we must look to these correlates to promote increased PA.","Grace, Sherry L; Williams, Alysha; Stewart, Donna E; Franche, Renée-Louise",Women & health,5,19

The effect of DTT concentrations on the polypeptide composition was also examined.

The rates of removal of the virus HA activity and gp 125 suggested that this polypeptide was an essential part of the virus haemagglutinin. The lack of evidence for any interpeptide disulphide bonds suggested that the loss of these glycoproteins was due to an alteration in their conformation brought about by the cleavage of intrapeptide disulphide bonds.

The goal was approached by engineering a construct containing the antisense sequence of the transgene and internal ribosome entry site of encephalomyocarditis virus flanked by 5'- and 3'-end sequences of HCV cDNA that contain cis-acting replication elements. Thus, expression of the transgene is only promoted when the minus-strand RNA has been synthesized by the functional replication machinery present in infected cells. Reporter assay and strand-specific reverse transcription-PCR showed selective transgene expression in Huh-7 cells harboring an autonomously replicating HCV subgenome but remaining silent in uninfected cells. Furthermore, using the cytosine deaminase suicide gene as a transgene coupled with recombinant adenovirus delivery, we demonstrated that cytosine deaminase was specifically expressed in replicon cells, resulting in marked chemosensitization of replicon cells to the cytotoxic effects of flucytosine. This new targeting strategy could be extended to other single-stranded RNA viruses encoding the unique RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that has no parallel in mammalian cells.","Zhang, Jing; Yamada, Osamu; Sakamoto, Takashi; Yoshida, Hiroshi; Araki, Hiromasa; Shimotohno, Kunitada",Journal of virology,5,16

An oxygen saturation range of 60%-70% is the threshold for administering oxygen in the first minutes after birth. The accuracy of newer generation oximeters to measure SpO₂ has not been compared against the 'gold standard', direct arterial blood oxygen saturation (SaO₂) when SaO₂ is low. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy and precision of Nellcor and Masimo oximeters to measure SpO₂ when SaO₂ <70%. METHOD Prospective observational study in ventilated anaesthetised newborn lambs with an indwelling carotid artery catheter. Ventilation was adjusted to achieve hypoxaemia. Nellcor (Oxi-Max 600 with Max-N sensor) and Masimo (Rad 4 with low noise optical probe (LNOP) sensor) sensors were applied to the right forelimb (preductal). An arterial blood sample was collected at 1-5 min intervals when the animal was hypoxic. The displayed SpO₂ was recorded. We used Bland-Altman analysis to determine precision and accuracy of each oximeter when SaO₂ <70%. RESULTS 17 lambs were studied, 165 measurements were obtained, 123 were SaO₂ <70%. The mean difference (±1.96 SD) Nellcor SpO₂-SaO₂ when SaO₂ <70% was 17% (-12% to 46%). The mean difference (±1.96 SD) Masimo SpO₂-SaO₂ when SaO2 <70% was 13% (-19% to 45%). CONCLUSIONS At SaO₂<70%, both monitors overestimated oxygen saturation (SpO₂) compared with the gold standard.

This allows the surgeon to confirm that the pedicle is securely double ligated and includes no ovarian remnant. For less experienced surgeons, SL rupture is often difficult and daunting because the ligament is buried within the abdominal viscera and must be identified blindly by palpation. Furthermore, in dogs, the ligament must be digitally disrupted, which may cause hemorrhage and serious injury to surrounding structures such as the ovarian pedicle. This article describes step-by-step techniques to disrupt the SL in dogs and cats.

This study examined changes in drinking as a result of campus closure due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), focusing on the influence of living situation. METHOD A sample of 312 college students (mean age = 21.2 years; 62% female; 67% White) responded to an online survey regarding their drinking behavior before and after university closures because of COVID-19. Those participants who lived with peers pre-closure and moved home to live with parents post-closure were compared with those who remained living with peers or remained living with parents in terms of changes in frequency and quantity of drinking. RESULTS A comparison of pre- to post-closure drinking indicated significant decreases in the typical number of drinks per week (from 11.5 to 9.9) and maximum drinks per day (from 4.9 to 3.3) and a slight increase in typical drinking days per week (from 3 to 3.2). Patterns of change significantly varied across groups. Those who moved from peers to parents showed significantly greater reductions in drinking days (from 3.1 to 2.7), number of drinks per week (from 13.9 to 8.5), and maximum drinks in one day (from 5.4 to 2.9) than those who remained living with peers or with parents. In contrast, the latter two groups significantly increased their frequency (from 3.0 to 3.7 days and 2.0 to 3.3 days, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Participants reduced their quantity of drinking during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We used the Wells-Riley mathematical model to estimate (1) the CO2 exposure concentrations in indoor environments where cases of inhalation airborne infection occurred based on reported epidemiological data and epidemic curves for influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), (2) the basic reproductive number, R0 (i.e., expected number of secondary cases on the introduction of a single infected individual in a completely susceptible population) and its variability in a shared indoor airspace, and (3) the risk for infection in various scenarios of exposure in a susceptible population for a range of R0. We also employ a standard susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) structure to relate Wells-Riley model derived R0 to a transmission parameter to implicate the relationships between indoor carbon dioxide concentration and contact rate. We estimate that a single case of SARS will infect 2.6 secondary cases on average in a population from nosocomial transmission, whereas less than 1 secondary infection was generated per case among school children. We also obtained an estimate of the basic reproductive number for influenza in a commercial airliner: the median value is 10.4. We suggest that improving the building air cleaning rate to lower the critical rebreathed fraction of indoor air can decrease transmission rate. Here, we show that virulence of the organism factors, infectious quantum generation rates (quanta/s by an infected person), and host factors determine the risk for inhalation of indoor airborne infection.","Liao, Chung-Min; Chang, Chao-Fang; Liang, Huang-Min",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,5,28

To better understand the role of Atg4B in rat tissue cells, we prepared antibodies against Atg4B, and PC12 cells in which the expression of Atg4B was knocked down by RNA interference. In the RNA interference-treated PC12 cells, for which the expression of Atg4B was 10% of wild-type PC12 cells, the expression of cytosolic LC3-I was similar to that in wild-type cells. Knockdown cell lysates, however, suppressed the cleavage of recombinant proLC3 to LC3-I. Moreover, the expression of Atg4B protein and mRNA was ubiquitous in rat tissues; however, the expression levels were not identical, but were dependent on the tissue, with the expression high in brain and testicular tissue, and low in muscular and heart tissue. In brain tissue, the expression of Atg4B protein and mRNA was higher in neurons, especially in the cerebellum and olfactory bulb, as evidenced by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. These lines of evidence suggest that Atg4B plays a major role in the processing of LC3 and is widely distributed in rat tissues. In particular, in brain tissues, autophagy may be deeply associated with the metabolism of neurons, especially in the cerebellum.","Yoshimura, Kentaro; Shibata, Masahiro; Koike, Masato; Gotoh, Kunihito; Fukaya, Masahiro; Watanabe, Masahiko; Uchiyama, Yasuo",Autophagy,5,26

DESIGN Analysis of national COVID-19 notifications and prospective observational study in families with children. METHOD Information about COVID-19 patients and their contacts was obtained from the registration systems used by the public health services. In an ongoing study, patients with COVID-19 were asked to participate if they have a family with children. On two occasions nose-throat swabs and blood were collected for PCR analysis and determination of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS The notifications suggest that transmission finds place mainly between adults and to a lesser extent between parents and children. For the family study, data were available from 54 households with a total of 227 participants. In families of a confirmed COVID-19 patient, children between 1 and 11 years were less often positive in PCR and serology than older children and adults. CONCLUSION The study gives no indications that children play an important role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Children can indeed become infected, but transmission mainly takes place between adult peers and from adult family members to children. Transmission among children or from children to adults, as is known in influenza, appears to be less common.

This largely reflects the polarized distribution of receptors on the basolateral surface. To identify new receptor-ligand interactions that might be used to redirect vectors to the apical surface, we investigated the process of infection of airway epithelial cells by human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), a common cause of respiratory tract infections. Using immunohistochemistry, we found the receptor for HCoV-229E (CD13 or aminopeptidase N) localized mainly to the apical surface of airway epithelia. When HCoV-229E was applied to the apical or basolateral surface of well-differentiated primary cultures of human airway epithelia, infection primarily occurred from the apical side. Similar results were noted when the virus was applied to cultured human tracheal explants. Newly synthesized virions were released mainly to the apical side. Thus, HCoV-229E preferentially infects human airway epithelia from the apical surface. The spike glycoprotein that mediates HCoV-229E binding and fusion to CD13 is a candidate for pseudotyping retroviral envelopes or modifying other viral vectors.","Wang, G; Deering, C; Macke, M; Shao, J; Burns, R; Blau, D M; Holmes, K V; Davidson, B L; Perlman, S; McCray, P B",Journal of virology,5,0

The fact that a tumour's vasculature is relatively more permeable than healthy host tissue should enable selective delivery of drugs to tumour tissue. Such delivery is relevant to carrier-mediated delivery of genetic medicine to tumours. This review discusses the potential of delivering therapeutic oligonucleotides (ONs) to tumours using cationic liposomes and cyclodextrins (CyDs), and the major hindrances posed by the tumour itself on such delivery. Cationic liposomes are generally 100-200 nm in diameter, whereas CyDs typically span 1.5 nm across. Cationic liposomes have been used for the introduction of nucleic acids into mammalian cells for more than a decade. CyD molecules are routinely used as agents that engender cholesterol efflux from lipid-laden cells, thus having an efficacious potential in the management of atherosclerosis. A recent trend is to employ these oligosaccharide molecules for delivering nucleic acids in cells both in-vitro and in-vivo. Comparisons are made with other ON delivery agents, such as porphyrin derivatives (< 1 nm), branched chain dendrimers (approximately 10 nm), polyethylenimine polymers (approximately 10 nm), nanoparticles (20-1,000 nm) and microspheres (> 1 microm), in the context of delivery to solid tumours.

Multiple randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews have reached discordant conclusions regarding the effectiveness of sodium chloride solution and steroids in managing spinal pain. True placebo-controlled trials with the injection of an inactive substance to unrelated structures have been nonexistent. Consequently, the discussions continue to escalate, seemingly without proper discourse. In this review, we sought to assess the true placebo nature of saline and the effectiveness of steroids. OBJECTIVES This assessment of sodium chloride solution is undertaken to assess if it is a true placebo when injected into the epidural space, is effective alone, and whether steroids are effective when injected with sodium chloride solution rather than local anesthetic in managing spinal pain. STUDY DESIGN A systematic review of randomized controlled trials utilizing sodium chloride solution alone, steroids alone, or sodium chloride solution with steroids in managing spinal pain secondary to disc herniation or spinal stenosis. METHODS The systematic review was performed utilizing Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Cochrane review criteria and Interventional Pain Management techniques--Quality Appraisal of Reliability and Risk of Bias Assessment (IPM-QRB) was used to assess the methodological quality assessment. Qualitative analysis was performed by utilizing best evidence synthesis principles, and quantitative analysis was performed utilizing meta-analysis with conventional methodology and single-arm meta-analysis. PubMed, Cochrane Library, US National Guideline Clearinghouse, Google Scholar, and prior systematic reviews and reference lists were utilized in the literature search from 1966 through December 2018. The evidence was summarized utilizing principles of best evidence synthesis on a scale of 1 to 5. Outcome measures for the present analysis, 20% improvement from the baseline pain scores or disability scores was considered clinically significant. Effectiveness was determined short-term if it was less than 6 months, whereas longer than 6 months was considered to be long-term. RESULTS Of the 8 trials meeting inclusion criteria, 2 trials utilized fluoroscopic imaging and one study utilized ultrasound. All other studies performed the procedure without fluoroscopy. With dual-arm meta-analysis, there was no significant difference between epidural sodium chloride solution and epidural steroids with sodium chloride solution. Utilizing single-arm analysis, both epidural saline and epidural steroids with saline were effective in reducing 20% of pain, however, only reducing disability scores by 10% to 12%. Based on the qualitative analysis, epidural saline and epidural steroids with saline showed effect beyond placebo and showed level I, or strong evidence, that neither epidural saline, nor epidural steroids with saline are placebo and that both are effective. LIMITATIONS Despite 8 randomized controlled trials, only 2 of them utilized fluoroscopy. Overall evidence is considered less than optimal and further studies elucidating these actions are strongly recommended. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis show that epidurally administered sodium chloride solution and sodium chloride solution with steroids may be effective in managing low back and lower extremity pain. Consequently, the findings of this review provide information that epidurally administered sodium chloride solution is not a true placebo.","Manchikanti, Laxmaiah; Knezevic, Nebojsa Nick; Sanapati, Jaya; Kaye, Alan D; Sanapati, Mahendra R; Hirsch, Joshua A",Pain physician,5,16

The significance of intestinal viruses as nosocomial pathogens,a comparison of the sensitivity of latex agglutination and electron microscopy in the diagnosis of rotaviruses and adenoviruses. PATIENTS AND METHOD 496 children, aged 3 weeks to 15 years, admitted in 2002 to the 1st Dpt of Infectious Diseases of the Bulovka Teaching Hospital with a diarrhoeal disorder, were examined to establish the aetiology of their complaint. All the children had the usual faecies culture and a culture of Campylobacter jejuni; direct electron microscopy was used for the demonstration of viruses. Additionally, latex agglutination was used in the investigation of rotaviruses and adenoviruses. In indicated cases the stools were also investigated for the presence of Clostridium difficile and of parasites. RESULTS Viruses were the most frequent cause of diarrhoeal diseases in children. Some type of virus was found in 413 children (83.26 % of the patients). Pure bacterial aetiology was seen in 35 children (7.05 %), pure viral aetiology in 381 children (66.73 %). A mixed infection, due to a combination of a bacterium and a virus, was found in 82 subjects (16.53 %), in 45 children (9.07 %) the aetiology of the disease could not be established. Rotaviruses, the most frequent infectious agent, were found in 300 children (6.48 %), caliciviruses in 68 (13.7 %), adenoviruses in 63 (12.7 %), coronaviruses in 39 (7.86 %), astroviruses only in 2 children (0.40 %). Children aged 1 to 5 years were the age group most affected by all the viral agents. The incidence of all the viruses, with the exception of coronaviruses, was highest in the cold seasons, the highest incidence of rotaviruses was in April. The most severe course of the disease was seen in rotaviral infections; 74.07 % of the children presenting with rotaviral gastroenteritis required rehydration, either i.v. or with a nasogastric tube. The longest hospital stay (5.29 days) was with adenoviruses. Nosocomial infections caused by rotaviruses were found in 5 cases-they substantially prolonged the mean time of hospital stay (13 days). Electron microscopy proved more sensitive than latex agglutination in the diagnosis of rotaviruses and adenoviruses. CONCLUSIONS The results of our trial confirmed the key role of viruses in the aetiology of diarrhoeal disorders in children in the Czech Republic. Given their frequently severe course, especially in the case of rotaviral infections, it is advisable to launch regular vaccinations against rotaviruses, once the new vaccine is on the market.

Recommendation from international organizations concerning the use of PPE are broadly consistent but equipment use is not. No previous studies examined the use of PPE in Tunisia. AIM Evaluate the availability of personal protective equipment(PPE) in addition to the reality and perception regarding personal safety in workplace. METHODS We carried out a cross-sectional survey from 15th April to 5th May 2020 across public and private institutions in Tunisia. A 33-item structured questionnaire was developed and administered to FHWs. RESULTS We received 723 responses. We found that there was a likely overuse of PPE in addition to a high rate of side effects caused by PPE. CONCLUSIONS Additional training in PPE use might be useful, and sessional work should be considered to decrease the side effects associated with PPE use.","Daghmouri, Mohamed Aziz; Akremi, Soumaya; Amouri, Nouha; Ouanes, Sami; Jaoua, Hazem; Ben Fadhel, Kamel",La Tunisie medicale,5,19

Such mice do develop apparently normal peptide-specific CD8+ T cell responses, as measured by MHC class I tetramer staining, but the majority of cells fail to become cytotoxic or express peptide-induced IFN-gamma production. In the present study, we demonstrate that functional defects of CD8+ T cells in LTalpha-/- mice can be largely rectified by the administration of plasmid DNA encoding CCR7 ligands before HSV infection. Treated mutant mice developed increased peptide-specific cytotoxic responses, enhanced numbers of CD8+ T cells capable of producing IFN-gamma, as well as improved resistance to HSV challenge. The corrective effect of chemokine treatment appeared to result from improved dendritic cell-mediated Ag presentation. Thus, a major consequence of the treatment was an increase in splenic dendritic cell number in CCR7 ligand-treated LTalpha-/- mice with such splenocyte populations showing improved APC activity in vitro. Our results document that functional defects of CD8+ T cells can be corrected, and indicate the value of plasmid vector encoding appropriate chemokines to achieve such immunotherapy.","Eo, S K; Kumaraguru, U; Rouse, B T",Journal of immunology,5,31

In an effort to reduce the amount of time required to perform a suture, new materials have been developed that through selfanchorage distribute tension more evenly across the suture and also eliminate the need of knot tying. The goal of this study was to assess the in vivo tissue response to a novel material (V-Loc tm; Covidien) in comparison to established materials (Vicryl, PDS II), in the case of bladder suturing, in a rat model. METHODS The study included 48 male Wistar rats. All underwent a median abdominal incision, with a 1cm cystotomy, followed by a running suture. The suture material used was either V-Loc absorbable self anchoring thread, Vicryl threaded absorbable suture or monofilament absorbable suture. The abdominal cavity and the bladder suture were macroscopically evaluated at the rats' scheduled death at 3 and 6 weeks. The bladder wall was microscopically assessed by a pathologist, with regard to tissue reaction and suture material degradation. RESULTS All rats survived the procedure, with the abdominal scar fully healed at week 2. There were no signs of infection or lithiasis during the observation. Macroscopically, at 3 weeks, the suture material was recognizable and visible in all cases, with special mention that the V-Loc thread was considerably more rigid, retaining its shape almost entirely, and provoked more adhesion of the surrounding tissue. At 6 weeks, the suture was indistinguishable in the bladder wall in the case of monofilament absorbable material, barely visible in the case of Vicryl, while the aspect of the V-Loc suture resembled the one at 3 weeks, with the material still clearly visible in the bladder wall, shape almost entirely maintained, and surrounding tissue adherence. Microscopically, at 3 weeks and 6 weeks, all bladder walls examined had regained their structure. At 3 weeks, the monofilament absorbable suture showed intense tissue reaction, with the material already in phagocytosis; at 6 weeks, no clear evidence of leftover material was observed. At 3 weeks, the Vicryl material showed moderate tissue reaction, with phagocytosis initiated between the strands of the material; at 6 weeks, the material was almost entirely absorbed, but with a clear leftover tissue reaction. In the case of the V-Loc suture, due to the hardness of the thread, the material itself could not be cut for analysis with the bladder wall, and the examination could only involve the bladder wall and marks of the thread. Thus, the tissue reaction was minimal, as was the presence of phagocytes at the suture site. The material showed little, if any, signs of absorption after 6 weeks. CONCLUSION The materials tested all proved equally effective in suturing the bladder wall in a rat model. However, the novel barbed thread proved a consistently low in-vivo absorption rate, while maintaining its rigidity over time. More research is needed to assess the possible clinical implications of these findings.","Petrut, Bogdan; Hogea, Maximiliam; Fetica, Bogdan; Kozan, Andrei; Feflea, Dragos; Sererman, Gabriel; Goezen, Ali Serdar; Rassweiler, Jens",Clujul medical,5,17

The available rapid detection methods either lack sensitivity or require complex laboratory manipulation. This study describes a rapid, sensitive detection method that can be easily applied to routine diagnosis. This method simultaneously detects influenza viruses A and B in specimens of patients with respiratory infections using a TaqMan-based real-time PCR assay. Primers and probes were selected from highly conserved regions of the matrix protein gene of influenza virus A and the hemagglutinin gene segment of influenza virus B. The applicability of this multiplex PCR was evaluated with 27 influenza virus A and 9 influenza virus B reference strains and isolates. In addition, the specificity of the assay was assessed using eight reference strains of other respiratory viruses (parainfluenza viruses 1 to 3, respiratory syncytial virus Long strain, rhinoviruses 1A and 14, and coronaviruses OC43 and 229E) and 30 combined nose and throat swabs from asymptomatic subjects. Electron microscopy-counted stocks of influenza viruses A and B were used to develop a quantitative PCR format. Thirteen copies of viral RNA were detected for influenza virus A, and 11 copies were detected for influenza virus B, equaling 0.02 and 0.006 50% tissue culture infective doses, respectively. The diagnostic efficacy of the multiplex TaqMan-based PCR was determined by testing 98 clinical samples. This real-time PCR technique was found to be more sensitive than the combination of conventional viral culturing and shell vial culturing.","van Elden, L J; Nijhuis, M; Schipper, P; Schuurman, R; van Loon, A M",Journal of clinical microbiology,5,9

The second outbreak started in July, was associated with North Africa, and involved travelers and an outbreak on passenger ships. This suggested the involvement of a new viral variant. METHODS: We sequenced the genomes from 916 SARS-CoV-2 strains from COVID-19 patients in our institute. The patients' demographic and clinical features were compared according to the infecting viral variant. RESULTS: From June 26th to August 14th, we identified a new viral variant (Marseille-1). Based on genome sequences (n = 89) or specific qPCR (n = 53), 142 patients infected with this variant were detected. It is characterized by a combination of 10 mutations located in the nsp2, nsp3, nsp12, S, ORF3a, ORF8 and N/ORF14 genes. We identified Senegal and Gambia, where the virus had been transferred from China and Europe in February-April as the sources of the Marseille-1 variant, which then most likely reached Marseille through Maghreb when French borders reopened. In France, this variant apparently remained almost limited to Marseille. In addition, it was significantly associated with a milder disease compared to clade 20A ancestor strains, in univariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can genetically diversify rapidly, its variants can diffuse internationally and cause successive outbreaks.","Colson, Philippe; Levasseur, Anthony; Gautret, Philippe; Fenollar, Florence; Thuan Hoang, Van; Delerce, Jeremy; Bitam, Idir; Saile, Rachid; Maaloum, Mossaab; Padane, Abdou; Bedotto, Marielle; Brechard, Ludivine; Bossi, Vincent; Ben Khedher, Mariem; Chaudet, Hervé; Million, Matthieu; Tissot-Dupont, Hervé; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Mboup, Souleymane; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Raoult, Didier",Travel Med Infect Dis,5,24

Furthermore, numerous sufferers have undergone off-label use or compassionate use treatments as well as antiretroviral, antiparasitic agents, anti-inflammatory compounds, and convales-cent plasma in either oral/parenteral route. This study aims to compile and analyze the efficient value of Remdesivir and Hydroxychloroquine and give an insight to their drug profile in the treatment and management of COVID-19 patients. METHOD: The literature search from PubMed, Crossref, Springer, Bentham Sciences, Google Scholar, DOAJ, ScienceDirect, and MEDLINE by using keywords like COVID-19, SAS-COV-2, Remdesivir, and hydroxychloroquine was done and ap-propriate peer-reviewed review articles, as well as research articles, were included and compiled in this review paper. The figures were prepared by using ChemOffice 2016 (ChemDraw Professional 2016) and Microsoft Office. RESULTS: The results of this study indicate that remdesivir in 5/10 studies from collected literature show a reduction in time of recovery and 5/10 shows no variance and having limitations. However, 6/12 shows an increase in the survival/reduction in time of recovery and 6/12 shows no effect or has limitations in the case of hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSION: There is a need to assess more pharmacokinetics and randomized controlled trials (RCT) for both remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine. Furthermore, studies should be conducted in different combinations along with hydroxychloro-quine and remdesivir to get efficient results.","Kaur, Amritpal; Chaudhary, Gaurav; Singh, Pargat; Arora, Sandeep; Kaur, Rajwinder",Current drug targets (Print),5,16

METHODS: A cohort study was conducted that included patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to the Tunisian national containment center. Follow-up consisted of a weekly RT-PCR test. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine independent predictors associated with negative RNA conversion. RESULTS: Among the 264 patients included, the median duration of viral clearance was 20 days (interquartile range (IQR) 17-32 days). The shortest duration was 9 days and the longest was 58 days. Factors associated with negative conversion of viral RNA were symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and shortness of breath (hazard ratio (HR) 0.600, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.401-0.897) and face mask use when exposed to COVID-19 cases (HR 2.006, 95% CI 1.247-3.228). The median time to RNA viral conversion was 18 days (IQR 16-21 days) when using masks versus 23 days (IQR 17-36 days) without wearing masks, and 24 days (IQR 18-36 days) for symptomatic patients versus 20 days (IQR 16-30 days) for asymptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study revealed that during SARS-CoV-2 infection, having symptoms delayed viral clearance, while wearing masks accelerated this conversion.

Specifically, we explored the joint effects of biological sex and gender diversity in self-identity on the role demands-work and family conflict relationships. To advance the inclusion of scientific knowledge, the present study was conducted in the cultural context of a Chinese society. We surveyed a sample of 317 Taiwanese employees. We used structured questionnaires to collect data on biological sex, gender identity (self-endorsement on masculinity and femininity traits), work and family demands, work-to-family conflict (WFC), and family-to-work conflict (FWC). We found two sets of significant three-way interactions (sex × femininity × role demands) in predicting work and family conflict. First, for men, identifying with high femininity traits strengthened the positive relationship between work demands and FWC; for women, identifying with low femininity traits strengthened the same relationship. Second, for men, identifying with high femininity traits strengthened the relationship between family demands and WFC; for women, identifying with low femininity traits strengthened the same relationship. Our findings highlight the importance of jointly examining the biological, psychological, and social aspects of gender on the work and family interface. Contextualizing in an Eastern cultural tradition, we put the spotlight on societal pressure on people of nontraditional gender identities.","Lu, Luo; Kao, Shu-Fang; Chang, Ting-Ting; Cooper, Cary L",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),5,13

In the Gift app, visitors create personal mini-tours for specific others. In Never let me go, one visitor controls the experience of another by sending them remote instructions as they follow them around the museum. By reflecting on the design of these experiences and their deployment in museums we show how interpersonalization can deliver engaging social visits in which visitors make their own interpretations. We contrast the approach to previous research in customization and algorithmic personalization. We reveal how these experiences relied on intimacy between pairs of visitors but also between visitors and the museum. We propose that interpersonalization requires museums to step back to make space for interpretation, but that this then raises the challenge of how to reintroduce the museum's own perspective. Finally, we articulate strategies and challenges for applying this approach.","Ryding, Karin; Spence, Jocelyn; Lovlie, Anders Sundnes; Benford, Steve",,5,21

We present data from the rapid implementation of virtual visits in a large, academic, movement disorder practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We describe the strategic shift to virtual visits and retrospectively examine elements that impacted the ability to switch to telemedicine visits using historical prepandemic in-person data as a comparator, including demographics, distance driven, and diagnosis distribution, with an additional focus on patients with deep brain stimulators. Results: A total of 686 telemedicine visits were performed over a five-week period (60% of those previously scheduled for in-office visits). The average age of participants was 65 years, 45% were female, and 73% were Caucasian. Men were more likely to make the transition (p = 0.02). Telemedicine patients lived farther from the clinic than those seen in person (66.47 km vs. 42.16 km, p < 0.001), age was not associated with making the switch, and patient satisfaction did not change. There was a significant shift in the distribution of movement disorder diagnoses seen by telemedicine compared to prepandemic in-person visits (p < 0.001). Patients with deep brain stimulators were more likely to use telemedicine (11.5% vs. 7%, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Telemedicine is feasible, viable and relevant in the care of movement disorder patients, although health care disparities appear evident for women and minorities. Patients with deep brain stimulators preferred telemedicine in our study. Further study is warranted to explore these findings.","Esper, Christine Doss; Scorr, Laura; Papazian, Sosi; Bartholomew, Daniel; Esper, Gregory Jacob; Factor, Stewart Alan",,5,1

The present work was conducted during the peak of restrictions in Germany (April/May 2020). In a convenient (N = 218) and representative sample (N = 715), we examined people's motivations to comply with these restrictions during the lockdown: Were they motivated by personal self-protection, or rather by solidarity with people in risk groups? Specifically, we investigated predictors of personal self-protection (compliance to protect the self against infection) and group-protection behaviours (compliance for reasons of solidarity in protecting people in risk groups). Results indicate that self- and group-protection result from different psychological processes: Whereas personal self-protection seems to be a form of coping with personal anxieties (epistemic and existential needs, personal threat), group protection is an intergroup phenomenon that is enabled by identification with a collective goal (common identity), the perception that society is capable of dealing with the virus (group efficacy), and concern for people in risk groups.

There are an ever-increasing number of reports of neurological symptoms in patients, from severe (encephalitis), to mild (hyposmia), suggesting the potential for neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2. This Perspective investigates the hypothesis that the reliance on self-reporting of hyposmia has resulted in an underestimation of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients. While the acute effect of the virus on the nervous system function is vastly overshadowed by the respiratory effects, we propose that it will be important to monitor convalescent individuals for potential long-term implications that may include neurodegenerative sequelae such as viral-associated parkinsonism. As it is possible to identify premorbid harbingers of Parkinson's disease, we propose long-term screening of SARS-CoV-2 cases post-recovery for these expressions of neurodegenerative disease. An accurate understanding of the incidence of neurological complications in COVID-19 requires long-term monitoring for sequelae after remission and a strategized health policy to ensure healthcare systems all over the world are prepared for a third wave of the virus in the form of parkinsonism.","Beauchamp, Leah C; Finkelstein, David I; Bush, Ashley I; Evans, Andrew H; Barnham, Kevin J",J Parkinsons Dis,5,17

Mutant HTT (mHTT) disrupts transcription, interferes with immune and mitochondrial function, and is aberrantly modified post-translationally. Evidence suggests that the mHTT RNA is toxic, and at the DNA level, somatic CAG repeat expansion in vulnerable cells influences the disease course. Genome-wide association studies have identified DNA repair pathways as modifiers of somatic instability and disease course in HD and other repeat expansion diseases. In animal models of HD, nucleocytoplasmic transport is disrupted and its restoration is neuroprotective. Novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers are among the earliest detectable changes in individuals with premanifest HD and have the sensitivity to detect therapeutic benefit. Therapeutically, the first human trial of an HTT-lowering antisense oligonucleotide successfully, and safely, reduced the CSF concentration of mHTT in individuals with HD. A larger trial, powered to detect clinical efficacy, is underway, along with trials of other HTT-lowering approaches. In this Review, we discuss new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of HD and future therapeutic strategies, including the modulation of DNA repair and targeting the DNA mutation itself.","Tabrizi, Sarah J; Flower, Michael D; Ross, Christopher A; Wild, Edward J","Nat. rev., Neurol.

Methods: An observational study utilizing available public data was conducted on the basis of data collected from December 31, 2019 until the end of April 2020 and then compared with data in January 2021. Several data were extracted, including information related to the date of the first reported case of SARS-CoV-2, total confirmed cases, total active cases and more. In addition, seven validated indicators were used to assess the countries' preparedness and precautionary actions. Results: A total of 175 countries were included in the study. The total COVID-19 infection rate increased exponentially and rapidly in North America and Europe from March to April. The application of precautions (indicators) varied between countries. School closures, quarantines and curfews were the most-applied indicators among all countries. As for the relationship between the indicators and their effects on the infection rate, Italy and Spain were the top countries in Europe and adopted all the indicators. Nevertheless, they faced high infection rates: 239,639 and 205,463 COVID-19 cases in Spain and Italy, respectively.

All nations are seriously challenged as the virus spreads rapidly across the globe with no regard for borders. The primary management of IBD involves treating uncontrolled inflammation with most patients requiring immune-based therapies. However, these therapies may weaken the immune system and potentially place IBD patients at increased risk of infections and infectious complications including those from COVID-19. AIM: To summarise the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, review unique concerns regarding IBD management and infection risk during the pandemic and assess COVID-19 management options and drug interactions in the IBD population. METHODS: A literature review on IBD, SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 was undertaken and relevant literature was summarised and critically examined. RESULTS: IBD patients do not appear to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and there is no evidence of an association between IBD therapies and increased risk of COVID-19. IBD medication adherence should be encouraged to prevent disease flare but where possible high-dose systemic corticosteroids should be avoided. Patients should exercise social distancing, optimise co-morbidities and be up to date with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. If a patient develops COVID-19, immune suppressing medications should be withheld until infection resolution and if trial medications for COVID-19 are being considered, potential drug interactions should be checked. CONCLUSIONS: IBD patient management presents a challenge in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The primary focus should remain on keeping bowel inflammation controlled and encouraging medication adherence.","Al-Ani, Aysha H; Prentice, Ralley E; Rentsch, Clarissa A; Johnson, Doug; Ardalan, Zaid; Heerasing, Neel; Garg, Mayur; Campbell, Sian; Sasadeusz, Joe; Macrae, Finlay A; Ng, Siew C; Rubin, David T; Christensen, Britt",Aliment Pharmacol Ther,5,22

However, current approaches usually focus on global information, hampering the analysis whenever the focus is to understand the differences among clusters. Thus, this paper introduces a methodology to visually explore DR results and interpret clusters' formation based on contrastive analysis. We also introduce a bipartite graph to visually interpret and explore the relationship between the statistical variables employed to understand how the data features influence cluster formation. Our approach is demonstrated through case studies, in which we explore two document collections related to news articles and tweets about COVID-19 symptoms.

Better risk stratification, with discharge of patients with a predicted mild disease trajectory, can ease this burden. Elevated blood-soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) has previously been shown to be associated with risk of intubation in confirmed COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether point-of-care measures of suPAR in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with symptoms of COVID-19 can identify patients that can be safely discharged. METHODS: Observational cohort study including all patients in the ED with symptoms of COVID-19 from March 19 to April 3, 2020. SuPAR was measured at first presentation. Review of electronic patient records 14 days after admission was used to assess disease trajectory. Primary endpoints were mild, moderate, severe, or very severe trajectory. The predictive value of suPAR, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), C-reactive protein (CRP), and duration of symptoms was calculated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC). RESULTS: Of 386 patients, 171 (44%) had a mild disease trajectory, 79 (20%) a moderate, 63 (16%) a severe, and 73 (19%) a very severe disease trajectory. Low suPAR was a strong marker of mild disease trajectory.

METHODS: We present retrospective analysis of masked rtCGM in 30 patients with severe COVID-19. rtCGM was used during the first 24 hours for comparison with arterial-line point of care (POC) values, where clinicians utilized rtCGM data to adjust insulin therapy in patients if rtCGM values were within 20% of point-of-care (POC) values during the masked period. An investigator-developed survey was administered to assess nursing staff (n = 66) perceptions regarding the use of rtCGM in the ICU. RESULTS: rtCGM data were used to adjust insulin therapy in 30 patients. Discordance between rtCGM and POC glucose values were observed in 11 patients but the differences were not considered clinically significant. Mean sensor glucose decreased from 235.7 ± 42.1 mg/dL (13.1 ± 2.1 mmol/L) to 202.7 ± 37.6 mg/dL (11.1 ± 2.1 mmol/L) with rtCGM management. Improvements in mean sensor glucose were observed in 77% of patients (n = 23) with concomitant reductions in daily POC measurements in 50% of patients (n = 15) with rtCGM management. The majority (63%) of nurses reported that rtCGM was helpful for improving care for patients with diabetes patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 49% indicated that rtCGM reduced their use of personal protective equipment (PPE). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a strong rationale to increase clinician awareness for the adoption and implementation of rtCGM systems in the ICU. Additional studies are needed to further understand the utility of rtCGM in critically ill patients and other clinical care settings.","Chow, Kenneth W; Kelly, Danielle J; Rieff, Mary C; Skala, Patricia A; Kravets, Igor; Charitou, Marina M; Morley, Eric J; Gupta, Rajarsi; Miller, Joshua D",J Diabetes Sci Technol,5,24

Using recently released enrollment data from the state of Wisconsin, this study goes further to show whether school district decisions to go virtual, as opposed to in-person, led families to make other educational choices including enrollment in virtual schools, or delaying enrollment in school. We find that school districts that chose virtual learning to start the 2020 school year saw the largest enrollment declines, while families gravitated toward private schools and school districts with existing virtual schools.

METHODS: This was a retrospective, non-comparative; inter ventional case series in which all patients with primary open-angle glaucoma who underwent phacoemulsification with Kahook Dual Blade goniotomy between June 2018 and April 2019 were enrolled. All the participants had a minimum follow-up period of 6 months. Preoperative and postoperative intraocular pressure values (at 1, 3, and 6 months), number of antiglaucoma medications, best-corrected visual acuity, surgical complications, and any subsequent related events or procedures were recorded. A logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between the different variables and surgical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients (57 eyes) were included (mean age, 70.5 ± 7 years). The mean intraocular pressure was reduced from 15.5 ± 4.2 mmHg to 12.2 ± 2.4 mmHg at the last follow-up visit (p<0.001). The mean number of antiglaucoma medications decreased significantly from 1.9 ± 1.0 to 0.6 ± 1.0 during the same period (p<0.001). On the basis of the predefined criterion (intraocular pressure reduction ≥20% and/or reduction ≥1 medication), the 6-month success rate was 86%. A higher preoperative intraocular pressure value (odds ratio [OR]= 2.01; p=0.016) and greater percentage of initial (30 days) intraocular pressure reduction (OR= 1.02; p=0.033) were sig nificantly associated with surgical success. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that phacoemulsification with Kahook Dual Blade goniotomy is an effective and safe alternative for cataract management in eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma that positively impacts intraocular pressure control and medication burden. Eyes with higher baseline intraocular pressure and a more pronounced initial response to the procedure appeared to present better outcomes at 6 months. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety profile of the procedure.","Ibrahim, Larissa Fouad; Pereira, Anna Flavia Ribeiro; Terenzi, Larissa Alves de Oliveira; Vianello, Marcos Pereira; Dorairaj, Syril Kumar; Prata, Tiago Santos; Kanadani, Fabio Nishimura",Arq. bras. oftalmol,5,26

The presence of the pre-existing cardiac disease is associated with an increased likelihood of severe clinical course and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Besides, current evidence indicates that a significant number of patients with COVID-19 also exhibit cardiovascular involvement even in the absence of known cardiac risk factors. Therefore, there is a need to understand the underlying mechanisms and genetic predispositions that explain cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19. Objectives: In silico analysis of publicly available datasets to decipher the molecular basis, potential pathways, and the role of the endothelium in the pathogenesis of cardiac and vascular injuries in COVID-19. Materials and Methods: Consistent significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared by endothelium and peripheral immune cells were identified in five microarray transcriptomic profiling datasets in patients with venous thromboembolism ""VTE,"" acute coronary syndrome, heart failure and/or cardiogenic shock (main cardiovascular injuries related to COVID-19) compared to healthy controls. The identified genes were further examined in the publicly available transcriptomic dataset for cell/tissue specificity in lung tissue, in different ethnicities and in SARS-CoV-2 infected vs. mock-infected lung tissues and cardiomyocytes. Results: We identified 36 DEGs in blood and endothelium known to play key roles in endothelium and vascular biology, regulation of cellular response to stress as well as endothelial cell migration. Some of these genes were upregulated significantly in SARS-CoV-2 infected lung tissues. On the other hand, some genes with cardioprotective functions were downregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cardiomyocytes. Conclusion: In conclusion, our findings from the analysis of publicly available transcriptomic datasets identified shared core genes pertinent to cardiac and vascular-related injuries and their probable role in genetic susceptibility to cardiovascular injury in patients with COVID-19.","Hachim, Mahmood Yaseen; Al Heialy, Saba; Senok, Abiola; Hamid, Qutayba; Alsheikh-Ali, Alawi",Front Cardiovasc Med,5,16

AIM: To describe the spatiotemporal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCWs in Wuhan, China. METHODS: In this study, an open-source dataset of HCW diagnoses was provided. A geographical detector technique was then used to investigate the impacts of hospital level, type, distance from the infection source, and other external indicators of HCW infections. FINDINGS: The number of daily HCW infections over time in Wuhan followed a log-normal distribution, with its mean observed on January 23rd, 2020, and a standard deviation of 10.8 days. The implementation of high-impact measures, such as the lockdown of the city, may have increased the probability of HCW infections in the short term, especially for those in the outer ring of Wuhan. The infection of HCWs in Wuhan exhibited clear spatial heterogeneity. The number of HCW infections was higher in the central city and lower in the outer city. CONCLUSION: HCW infections displayed significant spatial autocorrelation and dependence. Factor analysis revealed that hospital level and type had an even greater impact on HCW infections; third-class and general hospitals closer to infection sources were correlated with especially high risks of infection.","Wang, P; Ren, H; Zhu, X; Fu, X; Liu, H; Hu, T",J Hosp Infect,5,5

Casearia sylvestris is a plant used topically in different communities in Brazil, to treat wounds or promote cutaneous healing. To evaluate the topical anti-inflammatory activity for the crude hydroalcoholic extract of Casearia sylvestris (HCE-CS) in the models of single or multipe administration of chroton oil to induce ear edema in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experimental study using male Swiss mice (25-35g) kept under constant conditions in the Laboratory of Experimental Neuroscience (LaNEx)-UNISUL. Edema was induced in both models, respectively, by the single or multiple application of croton oil (CO, 2.5%, in 20µl) on the external surface of the ear. The different groups of animals (n= 8) received different treatments: vehicle, dexamethasone (DEXA) or different doses of HCE-CS. Edema was evaluated macroscopically for 6 h (early edema) or 8 days (late edema) after the first application of the CO and immediately after the animals were submitted to euthanasia for the collection of the samples (treated ears). For early edema, the tissue was biochemically evaluated for myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) and levels of nitrite/nitrate. In the late edema model, the ears were histologically evaluated for general morphometry, degranulated and non-degranulated mast cells, as well as acanthosis. RESULTS: Topic treatment with HCE-CS significantly reduced the early and late edema, as well as MPO activity and tissue levels of nitrite/nitrate. Finally, in the late edema model there was a lower density of degranulated mast cells in relation to the vehicle treated group and decreased thickness of the epidermis (acanthosis). CONCLUSION: These results suggest a possible benefit of topical treatment with HCE-CS in inflammatory conditions of the skin.","Heymanns, Ana Caroline; Albano, Micheline N; da Silveira, Márcia R; Muller, Simony D; Petrnilho, Fabrícia C; Gainski, Lucinéia D; Cargnin-Ferreira, Eduardo; Piovezan, Anna P",J Ethnopharmacol,5,16

In this study, we aimed to reveal the loss of sense of taste and smell in COVID-19 patients and to investigate whether these sensory losses are permanent in the healing process of the disease. METHOD: This prospective study included 94 COVID-19 patients. Smell and taste tests were applied to all patients. Ten days after the first test, a second test was applied to the patients with an impaired sense of smell to compare the results. RESULTS: Of the 94 patients, 55.3% were male, and the mean age was 53 ± 19.6 (21–90) years. There were 67 patients with smell and taste impairment, of whom 34 (50.7%) had smell impairment only, 3 (4.4%) had taste impairment only, and 30 (44.7%) had both smell and taste impairment. It was found that the smell scores of 55 patients with smell and taste impairment in the first evaluation were significantly higher at the second measurement; and their tasting period was significantly shortened compared to the first measurement (p˂0.001). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients may present to medical centers with a broad variety signs and symptoms. This study shows that impairment in the senses of smell and taste is common in this disease and strongly associated with COVID-19 infection. However, smell and taste impairment is mostly temporary and improves during the recovery period.","Salcan, İsmail; Karakeçili, Faruk; Salcan, Sara; Ünver, Edhem; Akyüz, Sümeyye; Seçkin, Ender; Cingi, Cemal",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,5,20

In this study we assessed SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (N = 272) and subjects vaccinated with the BNT162b2 m-RNA COVID-19 vaccine (N = 1256). For each participant, socio-demographic data, COVID-19 vaccination records, serological analyses, and SARS-CoV-2 infection status were collected. IgG antibodies against S1/S2 antigens of SARS-CoV-2 were detected. Almost all vaccinated subjects (99.8%) showed a seropositivity to anti-SARS-COV-2 IgG and more than 80% of vaccinated subjects had IgG concentrations > 200 AU/mL. In a Tobit multivariable regression analysis, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was statistically significantly associated with increased IgG concentrations (β coef = 266.4; p < 0.001). A statistically significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations was found with older age (β coef = −1.96 per year increase; p < 0.001), male sex (β coef = −22.3; p < 0.001), and days after immunization (β coef = −1.67 per day increase; p < 0.001). Our findings could support the vaccination campaigns confirming the high immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine under investigation with respect to the natural infection. Further studies will be required for evaluating the role of age and days after immunization in the persistence of vaccine antibodies and protection from the disease.","Amodio, Emanuele; Capra, Giuseppina; Casuccio, Alessandra; Grazia, Simona De; Genovese, Dario; Pizzo, Stefano; Calamusa, Giuseppe; Ferraro, Donatella; Giammanco, Giovanni Maurizio; Vitale, Francesco; Bonura, Floriana",Vaccines (Basel),5,1

One efficient tactic is to divert host immune responses toward an immunodominant decoy epitope and to induce non-neutralizing antibodies toward this epitope. Therefore, it is expected that the amount of decoy epitope in a subunit vaccine can affect the level of neutralizing antibody in an immunized animal. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by generating an antibody specific to the decoy epitope on the capsid protein of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). Using this antibody, we found that two commercial vaccines contained statistically different amounts of the decoy epitope. The vaccine with lower levels of decoy epitope induced a significantly higher level of neutralizing antibody after immunization. This antibody can be used as an analytical tool to monitor the quality of a vaccine from batch to batch.","Jin, Junyeong; Park, Changhoon; Cho, Sun-Hee; Chung, Junho",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,5,24

The ‘right’ to healthcare during armed conflict and its lack of enforcement despite a range of United Nations mandated requirements regarding health and healthcare provisions is likely to be a significant feature in future conflicts, as zoonotic induced pandemics become a more common global public health challenge. The issue of enforcement of health rights assurance and its implications for the public health management of global pandemics such as COVID-19 in and between countries and regions in conflict is the objective of this Review. Study Design Narrative Review. Methods Referenced to the framework of International humanitarian law (IHL) and International human rights law (IHRL) in order to explore and discuss the deficits in health rights assurances in conflict settings and illustrate how gaps in protection and lack of enforcement compounds the disease response. Both international humanitarian law, and international human rights law can be leveraged to ensure human and health rights are assured in conflict settings. There is a distinct lack of international criteria with regard to standards of health care coverage, infrastructure and service preservation to the civilian population during times of armed conflict. This has far reaching consequences when confounded by a pandemic or even localised disease outbreak. Results We illustrate how in a pandemic disease emergency, such as COVID-19, all life is threatened; and how leaving the citizen population exposed to this contagion is a human rights breach and an indirect method of warfare. The consequences of failure to effectively address such pandemic infections, (i.e. COVID-19), in a conflict setting are potentially catastrophic as prevention and containment responses are severely constrained by state insecurity, political instability, terrorism, repression, rights abuses and displacement of citizens. Neglect by State actors potentially constitutes a breach of the universal right to life. States cannot justify their failures to mitigate disease based on claims of lack of resources, even when available resources are minimal. Where discrimination of people with a disease, such as COVID-19, or minority groups at the point of access to health facilities occurs, this further breaches the principle of medical neutrality. Conclusions The example of the COVID-19 response may offer a viable route to leverage greater access and coverage of health care in conflict and humanitarian settings. A radicalised partnership approach during these times of emergency is warranted, based on an ethical “humanitarian intervention” approach to provide care to all affected by contagious disease in conflict settings..","Van Hout, Marie Claire; Wells, John",Public Health,5,1

The current research model on hepatitis E mainly uses experimental animal models (such as pigs, chickens, and rabbits) to explain the transmission of HEV. Few studies have developed a multi-host and multi-route transmission dynamic model (MHMRTDM) to explore the transmission feature of HEV. Hence, this study aimed to explore its transmission and evaluate the effectiveness of intervention using the dataset of Jiangsu Province. METHODS: We developed a dataset comprising all reported HEV cases in Jiangsu Province from 2005 to 2018. The MHMRTDM was developed according to the natural history of HEV cases among humans and pigs and the multi-transmission routes such as person-to-person, pig-to-person, and environment-to-person. We estimated the key parameter of the transmission using the principle of least root mean square to fit the curve of the MHMRTDM to the reported data. We developed models with single or combined countermeasures to assess the effectiveness of interventions, which include vaccination, shortening the infectious period, and cutting transmission routes. The indicator, total attack rate (TAR), was adopted to assess the effectiveness. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2018, 44 923 hepatitis E cases were reported in Jiangsu Province. The model fits the data well (R(2) = 0.655, P < 0.001). The incidence of the disease in Jiangsu Province and its cities peaks are around March; however, transmissibility of the disease peaks in December and January. The model showed that the most effective intervention was interrupting the pig-to-person route during the incidence trough of September, thereby reducing the TAR by 98.11%, followed by vaccination (reducing the TAR by 76.25% when the vaccination coefficient is 100%) and shortening the infectious period (reducing the TAR by 50.05% when the infectious period is shortened to 15 days). CONCLUSIONS: HEV could be controlled by interrupting the pig-to-person route, shortening the infectious period, and vaccination. Among these interventions, the most effective was interrupting the pig-to-person route.

Uncontrolled outbreaks can result in pandemics that have the potential to overburden our healthcare and economic systems. While vaccination is a conventional modality that can be employed to promote herd immunity, antiviral vaccines can only be applied prophylactically and do little to help patients who have already contracted viral infections. During the early stages of a disease outbreak when vaccines are unavailable, therapeutic antiviral drugs can be used as a stopgap solution. However, these treatments do not always work against emerging viral strains and can be accompanied by adverse effects that sometimes outweigh the benefits. Nanotechnology has the potential to overcome many of the challenges facing current antiviral therapies. For example, nanodelivery vehicles can be employed to drastically improve the pharmacokinetic profile of antiviral drugs while reducing their systemic toxicity. Other unique nanomaterials can be leveraged for their virucidal or virus-neutralizing properties. In this review, we discuss recent developments in antiviral nanotherapeutics and provide a perspective on the application of nanotechnology to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and future virus pandemics.","Zhou, Jiarong; Krishnan, Nishta; Jiang, Yao; Fang, Ronnie H.; Zhang, Liangfang",Nano Today,5,11

Some referred to a unique guide whereas others saw the issue of multiple recommendations by various societies and organization. In term of chronology, most guidelines were published in March with either downgraded (US and European CDC), relatively stable (WHO, Germany, and UK), or a mixing of high and low level equipment (France). The recommendation of respirators was universally recommended for aerosol generating procedures (AGP) across countries, although the type of respirators and what constituted an AGP was variable. Some guidance maintained the use of N95/99 for all contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases (i.e. Germany) whereas others, recommended a surgical mask (i.e. WHO, UK, France). The strategies to overcome shortage of respiratory protection equipment were based on minimizing the need and rationalizing the use, but also prolonging their use, reusing them after cleaning/sterilization, or using cloth masks. Conclusions Stable and consistent guidelines inside and across countries, clearly detailing the respiratory protection type, and the circumstances in which they need to be used may prevent the confusion among frontline staff, and avoid shortage.","Birgand, Gabriel; Mutters, Nico T.; Otter, Jonathan; Eichel, Vanessa M.; Lepelletier, Didier; Morgan, Daniel J.; Lucet, Jean Christophe",,5,20

We use a novel dataset that we collected to monitor the three countries during the crisis. As outcome variables, we used expectations (e.g., economic outlook, labour market situation, recovery), fear (e.g., scenario of new outburst, economic depression, restriction to individual rights and freedom), and behavioural change across the following dimensions: savings, cultural consumption, social capital, and risky behaviour. We provide descriptive evidence that is representative of the population of interest, and we estimate the impact of exposure to shock occurred during the crisis on the same outcome variables, using matching techniques. Our main findings are the following: we detected systematically negative expectations regarding the future and the recovery, majoritarian fears of an economic depression, a new outbreak, and a permanent restriction on freedom, a reduction in saving and in social capital. Exposure to shocks decreased expected job prospects, increased withdrawal from accumulated savings, and reduced contacts with the network relevant to job advancement, whereas it had inconclusive effects over fears.

The BOAST guidelines on outpatient orthopaedic fracture management took a pragmatic approach. At Great Western Hospital, Swindon, a closed loop audit was performed looking at a selection of these guidelines, to assess if our initial changes were sufficient and what could be improved. Method: An audit was designed around fracture immobilisation, type of initial fracture clinic assessment, default virtual follow up clinic and late imaging. Interventions were implemented and re-audited. Results: Initially 223 patients were identified over 4 weeks. Of these, 100% had removable casts and 99% did not have late imaging. 96% of patients were initially assessed virtually or had initial orthopaedic approval to be seen in face to face clinic. 97% had virtual follow up or had documented reasons why not. The 26 patients who were initially seen face to face were put through a simulated virtual fracture clinic. 22 appointments and 13 Xray attendances could have been avoided. We implemented a change of requiring all patients to be assessed at consultant level before having a face to face appointment. The re-audit showed over 99% achievement in all areas. Conclusion: Virtual fracture clinics, both triaging new patients and follow-up clinics have dramatically changed our outpatient management, helping the most appropriate patients to be seen face to face.

Infection by SARS-CoV-2 occurs via the binding of its S protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2-R). S binding to ACE2-R leads to a drop in ACE2, a homolog of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). In the central nervous system (CNS), ACE mediates neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and neurotoxicity responsible for several CNS disorders. ACE2 counteracts the damaging effects of ACE on CNS neurons. SARS-CoV-2 can directly access the CNS via the circulation or via cranial nerve I and the olfactory bulb. Inactivation of ACE2 following binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to ACE2-R in situ might blunt ACE2-moderating effects upon ACE CNS neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. Here, we propose a neurobiological mechanism directly involving SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2-R in the etiology of putative Neuro-CoViD-19.","Chiappelli, Francesco",Bioinformation,5,16

There are also at least two other sexually transmitted viruses, for which no vaccine is available, the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Traditional textbook explanatory paradigm of rapid mutation of retroviruses cannot adequately address the unavailability of vaccine for many sexually transmissible viruses, since HSV and HCV are DNA and non-retroviral RNA viruses, respectively, whereas effective vaccine for the horsefly-transmitted retroviral cousin of HIV, equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), was found in 1973. We reported earlier the highly disordered nature of proteins in outer shells of the HIV, HCV, and HSV. Such levels of disorder are completely absent among the classical viruses, such as smallpox, rabies, yellow fever, and polio viruses, for which efficient vaccines were discovered. This review analyzes the physiology and shell disorder of the various related and non-related viruses to argue that EIAV and the classical viruses need harder shells to survive during harsher conditions of non-sexual transmissions, thus making them vulnerable to antibody detection and neutralization. In contrast, the outer shell of the HIV-1 (with its preferential sexual transmission) is highly disordered, thereby allowing large scale motions of its surface glycoproteins and making it difficult for antibodies to bind to them. The theoretical underpinning of this concept is retrospectively traced to a classical 1920s experiment by the legendary scientist, Oswald Avery. This concept of viral shapeshifting has implications for improved treatment of cancer and infections via immune evasion.","Goh, Gerard Kian-Meng; Dunker, A.

Hence, there is an urgent need to develop novel anti-infective materials with broad-spectrum anti-pathogenic activity. In the present study, a fluorinated polycationic coating was synthesized on a hydrophilic and negatively charged polyester textile via one-step initiated chemical vapor deposition of poly(dimethyl amino methyl styrene-co-1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyl acrylate) (P(DMAMS-co-PFDA), PDP). The surface characterization results of SEM, FTIR, and EDX demonstrated the successful synthesis of PDP coating. Contact angle analysis revealed that PDP coating endowed the polyester textile with the hydrophobicity against the attachment of different aqueous foulants such as blood, coffee, and milk, as well as the oleophobicity against paraffin oil. Zeta potential analysis demonstrated that the PDP coating enabled a transformation of negative charge to positive charge on the surface of polyester textile. The PDP coating exhibited excellent contact-killing activity against both gram-negative Escherichia coli and gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, with the killing efficiency of approximate 99.9%. In addition, the antiviral capacity of PDP was determined by a green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression-based method using lentivirus-EGFP as a virus model. The PDP coating inactivated the negatively charged lentivirus-EGFP effectively. Moreover, the coating showed good biocompatibility toward mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells. All the above properties demonstrated that PDP would be a promising anti-pathogenic polymeric coating with wide applications in medicine, hygiene, hospital, etc., to control the bacterial and viral transmission and infection.","Song, Qing; Zhao, Ruixiang; Liu, Tong; Gao, Lingling; Su, Cuicui; Ye, Yumin; Yin Chan, Siew; Liu, Xinyue; Wang, Ke; Li, Peng; Huang, Wei",Chem Eng J,5,1

It is also in part an introductory review to relevant computational techniques for tackling viral threats, using COVID-19 as an example. Q-UEL tools for facilitating access to knowledge and bioinformatics tools were again used for efficiency, but the focus in this paper is even more on the virus. Subsequence KRSFIEDLLFNKV of the S2′ spike glycoprotein proteolytic cleavage site continues to appear important. Here it is shown to be recognizable in the common cold coronaviruses, avian coronaviruses and possibly as traces in the nidoviruses of reptiles and fish. Its function or functions thus seem important to the coronaviruses. It might represent SARS-CoV-2 Achilles’ Heel, less likely to acquire resistance by mutation, as has happened in some early SARS vaccine studies discussed in the previous paper. Preliminary conformational analysis of the receptor (ACE2) binding site of the spike protein is carried suggesting that while it is somewhat conserved, it appears to be more variable than KRSFIEDLLFNKV. However compounds like emodin that inhibit SARS entry, apparently by binding ACE2, might also have functions at several different human protein binding studies. The enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 is again argued to be a convenient model pharmacophore perhaps representing an ensemble of targets, and it is noted that it occurs both in lung and alimentary tract. Perhaps it benefits the virus to block an inflammatory response by inhibiting the dehydrogenase, but a fairly complex web involves several possible targets.","Robson, B.",Comput Biol Med,5,24

Human N-myc interactor (Nmi) protein, which has been shown to interact with signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins including STAT1, is important for the activation of IFN-γ induced STAT1-dependent transcription of many genes responsible for IFN-γ immune responses. However, no proteins encoded by herpesviruses have been reported to interact with Nmi and inhibit Nmi-mediated activation of IFN-γ immune responses to achieve immune evasion from IFN-γ responses. In this study, we show strong evidence that the UL23 protein of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a human herpesvirus, specifically interacts with Nmi. This interaction was identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen and co-immunoprecipitation in human cells. We observed that Nmi, when bound to UL23, was not associated with STAT1, suggesting that UL23 binding of Nmi disrupts the interaction of Nmi with STAT1. In cells overexpressing UL23, we observed (a) significantly reduced levels of Nmi and STAT1 in the nuclei, the sites where these proteins act to induce transcription of IFN-γ stimulated genes, and (b) decreased levels of the induction of the transcription of IFN-γ stimulated genes. UL23-deficient HCMV mutants induced higher transcription of IFN-γ stimulated genes and exhibited lower titers than parental and control revertant viruses expressing functional UL23 in IFN-γ treated cells. Thus, UL23 appears to interact directly with Nmi and inhibit nuclear translocation of Nmi and its associated protein STAT1, leading to a decrease of IFN-γ induced responses and an increase of viral resistance to IFN-γ. Our results further highlight the roles of UL23-Nmi interactions in facilitating viral immune escape from IFN-γ responses and enhancing viral resistance to IFN antiviral effects.","Feng, Linyuan; Sheng, Jingxue; Vu, Gia-Phong; Liu, Yujun; Foo, Chingman; Wu, Songbin; Trang, Phong; Paliza-Carre, Marco; Ran, Yanhong; Yang, Xiaoping; Sun, Xu; Deng, Zemin; Zhou, Tianhong; Lu, Sangwei; Li, Hongjian; Liu, Fenyong",PLoS Pathog,5,24

SGM individuals report elevated rates of emotional distress, symptoms related to mood and anxiety disorders, self-harm, and suicidal ideation and behavior. Social support is inversely related to psychiatric symptoms, regardless of SGM status. The COVID-19 pandemic—with its associated limited social interactions—represents an unprecedented period of acute distress with potential reductions in accessibility of social support, which might be of particular concern for SGM individuals' mental well-being. In the present study, we explored the extent to which potential changes in mental health outcomes (depressive symptoms, worry, perceived stress, positive and negative affect) throughout the duration of the pandemic were related to differences in perceptions of social support and engagement in virtual social activity, as a function of SGM status. Utilizing a large sample of US adults (N = 1,014; 18% reported SGM status), we assessed psychiatric symptoms, perceptions of social isolation, and amount of time spent socializing virtually at 3 time windows during the pandemic (between March 21 and May 21). Although SGM individuals reported greater levels of depression compared with non-SGM individuals at all 3 time points, there was no interaction between time and SGM status. Across all participants, mental health outcomes improved across time. Perceived social isolation was associated with poorer mental health outcomes. Further, time spent engaging in virtual socialization was associated with reduced depression, but only for those in self-reported quarantine. We discuss these results in terms of the nature of our sample and its impact on the generalizability of these findings to other SGM samples as well as directions for future research aimed at understanding potential health disparities in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rodriguez-Seijas, Craig; Fields, Eric C.; Bottary, Ryan; Kark, Sarah M.; Goldstein, Michael R.; Kensinger, Elizabeth A.; Payne, Jessica D.; Cunningham, Tony J.",Front Psychiatry,5,23

The incubation period did not statistically vary for biological sex or age, but some studies suggest a longer incubation period in the young and elderly. Cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei Province of China may have a shorter incubation period for COVID-19 but the shorter incubation period may be due to an increase in viral load. In studying coronavirus strains such as SARS and MERS, researchers have discovered an inverse relationship between incubation period length and virus severity.

Here we used this method to monitor the spatial and temporal progression of mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) infection in mice using luciferase‐expressing viruses. Upon intranasal inoculation, virus replication could initially be observed in the nasal cavity and the cervical lymph nodes, after which the infection spread to the brain and frequently to the eyes. The kinetics of virus spread to and clearance from the brain appeared to depend on the inoculation dose. After intraperitoneal inoculation, virus replication was predominantly observed in the liver and occasionally in the intestines, but interestingly also in the tail and paws. BLI thus elucidated new anatomic locations of virus replication. Furthermore, MHV dissemination was shown to be critically depended on the viral spike protein, but also on the mouse strain used. Widespread dissemination was observed in mice lacking a functional type I interferon response. The importance of the type I interferon system in limiting viral spread was also demonstrated by the administration of type I interferons to mice.

Results Out of all respondents (n=404), there was slight dominance of females (54.0%) over males (46.0%), and an almost equal distribution of Saudis (51.2%) and non-Saudis (48.8%); their mean age accounted for 36.9±8.7 years. PTSD was detected in 14.9%; the prevalence was significantly higher in those who had chronic diseases (23.7%), especially diabetics (30.8%) and obesity (41.2%), HCWs whose job necessitates exposure to positive cases (18.8%), and those who were isolated in hospitals while being ill. All the above values were statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusion and recommendations The prevalence of PTSD in the HCWs who survived COVID-19 came within the range of that in HCWs who were dealing with cases of COVID-19 without being affected. Efforts should be made to alleviate stress in HCWs during their work in pandemics.","Alshehri, Amjed S; Alghamdi, ‏Amal H",Cureus,5,0

Among them, FET-based sensors are very useful in that of their versatile operating characteristics using various materials. Herein, after addressing the basic principles of BioFET, we conduct an overall review of BioFET on two of the main structural elements: transducing materials and probes. Transducing materials were classified into graphene, carbon nanotube, silicon, MOF, etc., and probes were classified into antibodies, enzymes, aptamers, etc.. The important elements in designing BioFETs, such as electrical properties of each material, Debye length, and fabrication process are introduced along with their respective structures and materials. After the review of each of these structures and characteristics, examples are discussed along with sensitivity, selectivity, and limit of detection. In addition to the operating aspects of the senser, novel processes, treatments, and materials that can be considered for various purposes are also introduced. Based on the understanding, an overview of diverse examples is given by dividing the applications of BioFET into three main types: antigen sensing, biomarker sensing, and drug effect monitoring. Focusing on these general reviews, we conclude how the future direction of development will move forward and what the main challenge is.","Sung, Daeun; Koo, Jahyun",Biomed Eng Lett,5,30

In pseudovirus studies, LY-CoV1404 retains potent neutralizing activity against numerous variants including B.1.617.2, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.427/B.1.429, P.1, and B.1.526, binding to these variants in the presence of their underlying RBD mutations (which include K417N, L452R, E484K, and N501Y). LY-CoV1404 also neutralizes multiple isolates of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus in two different assays. The RBD positions comprising the LY-CoV1404 epitope are highly conserved, with the exception of N439 and N501; notably the binding and neutralizing activity of LY-CoV1404 is unaffected by the most common mutations at these positions (N439K and N501Y). New variant-resistant treatments such as LY-CoV1404 are desperately needed, given that some of the existing therapeutic antibodies are less effective or ineffective against certain variants and the impact of variants on vaccine efficacy is still poorly understood. The breadth of variant binding, potent neutralizing activity and the relatively conserved epitope suggest that LY-CoV1404 is one in a panel of well-characterized, clinically developable antibodies that could be deployed as potentially long-term solutions to address current and emerging variants. In Brief LY-CoV1404 is a potent SARS-CoV-2-binding antibody that neutralizes all known variants of concern and whose epitope is rarely mutated. Highlights LY-CoV1404 potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 authentic virus and all known variants of concern including the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant No loss of potency against currently circulating variants Binding epitope on RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is rarely mutated in GISAID database Breadth of neutralizing activity and potency supports clinical development","Westendorf, Kathryn; Žentelis, Stefanie; Foster, Denisa; Vaillancourt, Peter; Wiggin, Matthew; Lovett, Erica; van der Lee, Robin; Hendle, Jörg; Pustilnik, Anna; Sauder, J.

Juxtaposing competing theories about the urban antecedents of COVID-19, our key argument is that urban political attributes overshadow the effects of cities' spatial characteristics. This is true even when considering levels of compliance with movement restrictions and controlling for demographic and socio-economic conditions. Taking advantage of Israel as a living lab for studying COVID-19, we examine 271 localities during the first 3 months of the outbreak in Israel, a country where over 90% of the population is urban. Rather than density, we find social makeup and politics to have a critical effect. Cities with some types of political minority groups, but not others, exhibit higher infection rates. Compliance has a significant effect and density's influence on the spread of the disease is contingent on urban political attributes. We conclude with assessing how the relationship between the politics of cities and the spread of contagious diseases sheds new light on tensions between neo-Malthusian sentiments and concerns about urban sprawl and environmental degradation.","Barak, Nir; Sommer, Udi; Mualam, Nir",Sci Total Environ,5,22

The nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV may be critical for pathogenicity. This study sought to discover the host proteins that interact with SARS-CoV NP. RESULTS: Using surface plasmon resonance biomolecular interaction analysis (SPR/BIA) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, we found that only the proteasome subunit p42 from human fetal lung diploid fibroblast (2BS) cells bound to SARS-CoV NP. This interaction was confirmed by the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein pulldown technique. The co-localization signal of SARS-CoV NP and proteasome subunit p42 in 2BS cells was detected using indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. p42 is a subunit of the 26S proteasome; this large, multi-protein complex is a component of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is involved in a variety of basic cellular processes and inflammatory responses. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report that SARS-CoV NP interacts with the proteasome subunit p42 within host cells. These data enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV pathogenicity and the means by which SARS-CoV interacts with host cells.","Wang, Qin; Li, Chuan; Zhang, Quanfu; Wang, Tao; Li, Jiandong; Guan, Wuxiang; Yu, Jianshi; Liang, Mifang; Li, Dexin",Virol J,5,5

Herein, we report on the electronic excited states of a bound merocyanine dye to c-Myc G4 using extensive multiscale quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations. We find that the absorption spectra of c-Myc G4, both without and with the intercalated dye, are mainly composed of exciton states and mixed local/charge-transfer states. The presence of merocyanine hardly affects the energy range of the guanine absorption or the number of guanines excited. However, it triggers a substantial amount (16%) of detrimental pure charge-transfer states involving oxidized guanines. We identify the rigidity introduced by the probe in G4, reducing the overlap among guanines, as the one responsible for the changes in the exciton and charge-transfer states, ultimately leading to a redshift of the absorption maximum.","Avagliano, Davide; Tkaczyk, Sara; Sánchez-Murcia, Pedro A.; González, Leticia",J Phys Chem Lett,5,3

This study aims to explore the feasibility of the application of a 5G-powered robot-assisted teleultrasound diagnostic system in an intensive care unit. METHODS: In this study, the robot-assisted teleultrasound diagnostic system MGIUS-R3 was used. Using 5G network technology, the doctor manipulates the robotic arm to perform teleultrasound examination. The doctor can adjust parameters via the teleultrasound control panel, and real-time transmission of audio, video and ultrasound images can facilitate simultaneous communication between both parties. All patients underwent robot-assisted teleultrasound examination and bedside ultrasound examination of the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, kidney, as well as assessment for pleural effusion and abdominal effusion. We evaluated the feasibility of the application of the robot-assisted teleultrasound diagnosis system in the intensive care unit in terms of consultation duration, image quality, and safety. We also compared diagnostic consistency and differences. RESULTS: Apart from one patient who was excluded due to severe intestinal gas interference and poor image quality, a total of 32 patients were included in this study. Every patient completed all relevant examinations. Among them, 20 patients were male; 12 were female. The average age of the patients was 61 ± 20 years. The average duration of teleultrasound diagnosis was 17 ± 7 min. Of the 32 patients, 26 had positive results, 6 had negative results, and 5 had inconsistent diagnoses. The overall diagnostic results were basically the same, and there were no differences in diagnostic levels between the two. The overall average image quality score was 4.73 points, which represented a high-quality image. After robot-assisted teleultrasound examination, no significant changes were observed in the vital signs of patients as compared to before examination, and no examination-related complications were found. CONCLUSION: The 5G-powered robot-assisted teleultrasound diagnostic system was associated with the benefits of clear images, simple operation, relatively high levels of consistency in terms of diagnostic results, higher levels of safety, and has considerable application value in the intensive care unit.","Duan, Shaobo; Liu, Luwen; Chen, Yongqing; Yang, Long; Zhang, Ye; Wang, Shuaiyang; Hao, Liuwei; Zhang, Lianzhong",Crit Care,5,23

Advanced understanding of young adults' willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine and the potential factors influencing their vaccine intention will contribute to the development and implementation of effective strategies to promote COVID-19 vaccine uptake among this group. The current study investigated how risk exposures and risk perceptions of COVID-19 (e.g., perceived susceptibility, severity, and fear of COVID-19) as well as negative attitudes toward general vaccination were related to COVID vaccine acceptance among college students based on online survey data from 1062 college students in South Carolina . Hierarchical linear regression was used to examine the association of these factors with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance controlling for key demographics. Results suggested that perceived severity and fear of COVID-19 were positively associated with vaccine acceptance, while higher level of risk exposures (work/study place exposure) and negative attitude toward general vaccination were associated with low vaccine acceptance. Our findings suggested that we need tailored education messages for college students to emphasize the severity of COVID-19, particularly potential long-term negative consequences on health, address the concerns of side effects of general vaccines by dispelling the misconception, and target the most vulnerable subgroups who reported high level of risk exposures while showed low intention to take the vaccine. Efforts are warranted to increase college students' perceived susceptibility and severity and promote their self-efficacy in health management and encourage them to take protective behaviors including vaccine uptake.","Qiao, S.; Tam, C.

In this study, we present a small-sized and ultrasensitive accelerometer for continuous monitoring of lung and heart sounds to evaluate the lung and heart states of patients. Based on two-stage amplification, which consists of an asymmetric gapped cantilever and a charge amplifier, our accelerometer exhibited an extremely high ratio of sensitivity to noise compared with conventional structures. Our sensor achieves a high sensitivity of 9.2 V/g at frequencies less than 1000 Hz, making it suitable to use to monitor weak physiological signals, including heart and lung sounds. For the first time, lung injury, heart injury, and both lung and heart injuries in discharged pneumonia patients were revealed by our sensor device. Our sound sensor also successfully tracked the recovery course of the discharged pneumonia patients. Over time, the lung and heart states of the patients gradually improved after discharge. Our observations were in good agreement with clinical reports. Compared with conventional medical instruments, our sensor device provides rapid and highly sensitive detection of lung and heart sounds, which greatly helps in the evaluation of lung and heart states of pneumonia patients. This sensor provides a cost-effective alternative approach to the diagnosis and prognosis of pneumonia and has the potential for clinical and home-use health monitoring.","Chen, Hongbin; Yu, Shuai; Liu, Haiyang; Liu, Jie; Xiao, Yongguang; Wu, Dandan; Pan, Xiaoyu; Zhou, Cuihong; Lei, Yifeng; Liu, Sheng",Microsyst Nanoeng,5,16

In the UK, there is no consistent approach to how information about residents’ medical history, care needs and preferences are collected and shared. This limits opportunities to understand the care home population, have a systematic approach to assessment and documentation of care, identifiy care home residents at risk of deterioration and review care. Countries with standardised approaches to residents’ assessment, care planning and review (eg, minimum data sets (MDS)) use the data to understand the care home population, guide resource allocation, monitor services delivery and for research. The aim of this realist review is to develop a theory-driven understanding of how care home staff implement and use MDS to plan and deliver care of individual residents. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A realist review will be conducted in three research stages. Stage 1 will scope the literature and develop candidate programme theories of what ensures effective uptake and sustained implementation of an MDS. Stage2 will test and refine these theories through further iterative searches of the evidence from the literature to establish how effective uptake of an MDS can be achieved. Stage 3 will consult with relevant stakeholders to test or refine the programme theory (theories) of how an MDS works at the resident level of care for different stakeholders and in what circumstances. Data synthesis will use realist logic to align data from each eligible article with possible context–mechanism–outcome configurations or specific elements that answer the research questions. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The University of Hertfordshire Ethics Committee has approved this study (HSK/SF/UH/04169). Findings will be disseminated through briefings with stakeholders, conference presentations, a national consultation on the use of an MDS in UK long-term care settings, publications in peer-reviewed journals and in print and social media publications accessible to residents, relatives and care home staff.

DESIGN: A case–control gender study performed from 2016 to 2019. METHODS: A gender and age matched‐paired sample of 74 nurses was recruited and divided into men (n = 37) and women (n = 37). FFP3 filtering respirators and surgical masks fit factors were compared between male and female nurses by Mann–Whitney U tests. These measurements were tested to pass or fail according to the OSHA (≥100) and AIHA (≥50) criteria by Fisher exact tests for a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Global fit factor mean (standard deviation) was 2.86 (2.73) and 3.55 (6.34) for male and female nurses wearing surgical masks (p = .180), respectively, and nobody passed neither OSHA nor AIHA criteria (p = 1.00). Nevertheless, global fit factor were 30.82 (28.42) and 49.65 (43.04) for male and female nurses wearing FFP3 respirators, respectively, being significantly lower and worse in male nurses (p = .037). According to OSHA criteria, only 2.70% and 13.51% of male and females nurses, respectively, passed with non‐significant difference (p = .199), meanwhile 21.62% and 48.64% of male and female nurses, respectively, passed AIHA criteria showing significant differences (p = .027) wearing FFP3 respirators. CONCLUSIONS: All male and female nurses wearing surgical masks failed to pass OSHA and AIHA criteria. Global fit factor of the proposed FFP3 filtering respirators was decreased and worse in male than female nurses. IMPACT: Our recommendation is to avoid surgical masks use for protective purposes and use the proposed FFP3 filtering respirators among nurses. Each nurse should be fit tested for its own respirator with special caution in male nurses due to their lower fit factor achieved and most of them failed to pass OSHA and AIHA criteria, especially during COVID‐19 pandemic.","De‐Yñigo‐Mojado, Borja; Madera‐García, Javier; Becerro‐De‐Bengoa‐Vallejo, Ricardo; Losa‐Iglesias, Marta E.; Rodríguez‐Sanz, David; Calvo‐Lobo, Cesar; López‐López, Daniel; Casado‐Hernández, Israel; San‐Antolín, Marta",J Adv Nurs,5,24

The purpose of the review is to substantiate the importance of an interdisciplinary approach in the context of increased interest in the study of viral infections in bats. This review was written for researchers who have not previously dealt with this problem.Since the beginning of this century, the number of known virus species associated with bats has increased by an order of magnitude (>200). The families Rhabdoviridae, Coronaviridae, Paramyxoviridae are in the first ranks according to the number of findings, and the highest diversity of viruses has been established for the families Vespertilionidae, Pteropodidae, Molossidae. Interdisciplinary cooperation positively influences the efficiency, biological safety and practical significance of the ongoing research. The best results were achieved by multidisciplinary teams with good cross-training in several specialties. Many papers emphasize the need to balance health and conservation interests.The analysis of scientific publications indicates a change in research approaches in this area: from collecting individual facts within the framework of narrow specialties to a comprehensive assessment of new knowledge from ecological, evolutionary and socio-economic positions.

Antigen tests are disappointing with their lack of sensitivity. Among molecular tools allowing a diagnosis in less than an hour, only one, the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay, has exhibited a good sensitivity. However, we are also facing a global shortage of reagents and kits. Thus, it is imperative to evaluate other point-of-care molecular tests. METHODS: We evaluated the VitaPCR™ RT-PCR assay, whose sample analysis time is of approximately 20 min, in nasopharyngeal secretions from 534 patients presenting to our Institute, for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and compared it to our routine RT-PCR assay. We also compared the two assays with tenfold dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 strain. RESULTS: Compared to our routine RT-PCR and the previous diagnosis of COVID-19, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of VitaPCR™ can be evaluated to be 99.3 % (155/156), 94.7 % (358/378), 88.6 % (155/175) and 99.7 % (358/359), respectively. Tenfold dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 strain show that the VitaPCR™ was more sensitive that our routine RT-PCR assay. CONCLUSION: The VitaPCR™ SARS-CoV-2 is an accurate rapid test, suitable for clinical practice that can be performed as part of a point-of-care testing, for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19.","Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Zandotti, Christine; Ninove, Laetitia; Prudent, Elsa; Colson, Philippe; Gazin, Céline; Million, Matthieu; Tissot-Dupont, Hervé; Fenollar, Florence",J Clin Virol,5,1

Especially during the current pandemic, many clinicians around the world have employed LUS to assess the condition of the lung for patients suspected and/or affected by COVID-19. However, LUS is currently performed with standard ultrasound imaging, which is not designed to cope with the high air content present in lung tissues. Nowadays LUS lacks standardization and suffers from the absence of quantitative approaches. To elevate LUS to the level of other ultrasound imaging applications, several aspects deserve attention from the technical and clinical world.

The mutation R518W or R518Q on the NPC1 is one of type of disease‐related mutation that causes cholesterol transports to be cut in half, which results in the accumulation of cholesterol and lipids in the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment of the cell. Even though there has been significant progress with understanding the cholesterol transport by NPC1 in combination with NPC2, especially after the structural determination of the full length NPC1 in 2016, many details such as the interaction of the full length NPC1 with the NPC2, the molecular motions responsible for the cholesterol transport during and after this interaction, and the structure and the function relations of many mutations are still not well understood. In this paper, we report the extensive molecular dynamics simulations in order to gain insight into the structure and the dynamics of NPC1 lumenal domain for the cholesterol transport and the disease behind the mutation (R518W). It was found that the mutation induces a structural shift of the NTD (N‐terminal domain), toward the loop region in the MLD (middle lumenal domain), which is believed to play a central role in the interaction with NPC2 protein, so the interaction with the NPC2 protein might be less favorable compared to the wild NPC1. Also, the simulation indicates the possible re‐orientation of the NTD with both the wild and the R518W mutated NPC1 after receiving the cholesterol from the NPC2, that align to form an internal tunnel, which is a possible pose for further action in cholesterol trafficking. We believe the current study can provide a better understanding of the cholesterol transport by NPC1 especially the role of NTD of NPC1 in combination with NPC2 interactions.","Yoon, HyeJin; Jeong, Hyunah; Lee, Hyung Ho; Jang, Soonmin",J Neurochem,5,16

Although several FDA-approved drugs are currently under clinical trials for drug repositioning, there is an on-going global effort for new drug identification. In this paper, using multi-omics (interactome, proteome, transcriptome, and bibliome) data and subsequent integrated analysis, we present the biological events associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify several candidate drugs against this viral disease. We found that: (i) Interactome-based infection pathways differ from the other three omics-based profiles. (ii) Viral process, mRNA splicing, cytokine and interferon signaling, and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis are important pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infection. (iii) SARS-CoV-2 infection also shares pathways with Influenza A, Epstein-Barr virus, HTLV-I, Measles, and Hepatitis virus. (iv) Further, bacterial, parasitic, and protozoan infection pathways such as Tuberculosis, Malaria, and Leishmaniasis are also shared by this virus. (v) A total of 50 candidate drugs including the prophylaxis agents and pathway specific inhibitors are identified against COVID-19. (vi) Betamethasone, Estrogen, Simvastatin, Hydrocortisone, Tositumomab, Cyclosporin A etc. are among the important drugs. (vii) Ozone, Nitric oxide, and photosensitizer drugs are also identified as possible therapeutic candidates. (viii) Curcumin, Retinoic acids, Vitamin D, Arsenic, Copper, and Zinc may be the candidate prophylaxis agents.

To date, there are no proven effective therapies for this virus. Efforts made to develop antiviral strategies for the treatment of COVID‐19 are underway. Respiratory viral infections, such as influenza, predispose patients to co‐infections and these lead to increased disease severity and mortality. Numerous types of antibiotics such as azithromycin have been employed for the prevention and treatment of bacterial co‐infection and secondary bacterial infections in patients with a viral respiratory infection (e.g., SARS‐CoV‐2). Although antibiotics do not directly affect SARS‐CoV‐2, viral respiratory infections often result in bacterial pneumonia. It is possible that some patients die from bacterial co‐infection rather than virus itself. To date, a considerable number of bacterial strains have been resistant to various antibiotics such as azithromycin, and the overuse could render those or other antibiotics even less effective. Therefore, bacterial co‐infection and secondary bacterial infection are considered critical risk factors for the severity and mortality rates of COVID‐19. Also, the antibiotic‐resistant as a result of overusing must be considered.

Glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) are a group of antidiabetic drugs, the glucose reducing effect of which is founded on augmenting glucose-dependent insulin secretion with concomitant reduction of glucagon secretion and delayed gastric emptying. Apart from their glucose lowering effects, GLP1-RAs also exert a plethora of pleiotropic activities in the form of anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and anti-obesogenic properties, with beneficial cardiovascular and renal impact. All these make this class of drugs a preferred option for managing patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and potentially helpful in those with SARS-CoV2 infection. AREAS COVERED: In the present article we propose a hypothetical molecular mechanism by which GLP1-RAs may interact with SARS–CoV-2 activity. EXPERT OPINION: The beneficial properties of GLP1-RAs may be of specific importance during COVID-19 infection for the most fragile patients with chronic comorbid conditions such as T2D, and those at higher cardiovascular and renal disease risk. Yet, further studies are needed to confirm our hypothesis and preliminary findings available in the literature.","Banerjee, Yajnavalka; Pantea Stoian, Anca; Silva-Nunes, José; Sonmez, Alper; Rizvi, Ali A.; Janez, Andrej; Rizzo, Manfredi",Expert opinion on drug safety,5,20

To inform HCPs, public health issues PHEPR messages that provide guidelines and updates, and facilitate surveillance so HCPs will recognize and control communicable diseases, prevent excess deaths and mitigate suffering. Public health agencies need to know that the PHEPR messages sent to HCPs reach their target audience and are effective and informative. Public health agencies need to know that the PHEPR messages sent to HCPs reach their target audience and are effective and informative. We conducted a literature review to investigate the systems and tools used by public health to generate PHEPR communications to HCPs, and to identify specific characteristics of message delivery mechanisms and formats that may be associated with effective PHEPR communications. METHODS: A systematic review of peer- and non-peer-reviewed literature focused on the following questions: 1) What public health systems exist for communicating PHEPR messages from public health agencies to HCPs? 2) Have these systems been evaluated and, if yes, what criteria were used to evaluate these systems? 3) What have these evaluations discovered about characterizations of the most effective ways for public health agencies to communicate PHEPR messages to HCPs? RESULTS: We identified 25 systems or tools for communicating PHEPR messages from public health agencies to HCPs. Few articles assessed PHEPR communication systems or messaging methods or outcomes. Only one study compared the effectiveness of the delivery format, device or message itself. We also discovered that the potential is high for HCPs to experience ""message overload"" given redundancy of PHEPR messaging in multiple formats and/or through different delivery systems. CONCLUSIONS: We found that detailed descriptions of PHEPR messaging from public health to HCPs are scarce in the literature and, even when available are rarely evaluated in any systematic fashion. To meet present-day and future information needs for emergency preparedness, more attention needs to be given to evaluating the effectiveness of these systems in a scientifically rigorous manner.","Revere, Debra; Nelson, Kailey; Thiede, Hanne; Duchin, Jeffrey; Stergachis, Andy; Baseman, Janet",BMC Public Health,5,8

Au sein de notre site, notre structure a été la seule à accueillir une unité pour gérer des patients confirmés COVID-19 positifs. En l’absence de soins intensifs sur place, ces patients étaient triés au SAU et ne venaient que les patients sans indication de soins intensifs en raison du bénéfice/risque attendu (âge, comorbidités). Pour activer cette unité, une équipe mutualisée a été mise en place que ce soit au niveau du personnel médical PM (seniors, internes, externes) que personnel non médical (PNM) détachés des services de médecine interne, pédiatrie, médecine du sport, consultation, endocrinologie, hépatologie de notre CHU. Un support psychologique a été proposé aux soignants et aux familles par une équipe mobile de psychiatrie. L’activité quotidienne a été réorganisée après la création de plusieurs binômes junior-senior, en service de 8h à 19h, 7 j/7. La continuité des soins a été assurée chaque jour par 3 staffs pour permettre respectivement les transmissions de la nuit entre PM et PNM ; l’état des lieux après la visite du matin ; les projets pour le lendemain. Tous les patients ont été réévalués chaque jour et réorientés selon une échelle de gravité structurée par 5 codes-couleurs. Les externes ont eu pour mission de contacter les familles du fait de la limitation des visites, ainsi que les médecins traitants afin d’améliorer la gestion après le RAD.

Our aim is to uncover the rate of acute stroke in COVID-19 patients and identify those cases in which a possible causative relationship could exist. METHODS: We performed a single-center analysis of a prospective mandatory database. We studied all patients with confirmed COVID-19 and stroke diagnoses from March 2(nd) to April 30(th). Demographic, clinical, and imaging data were prospectively collected. Final diagnosis was determined after full diagnostic work-up unless impossible due to death. RESULTS: Of 2050 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 21 (1.02%) presented an acute ischemic stroke 21 and 4 (0.2%) suffered an intracranial hemorrhage. After the diagnostic work-up, in 60.0% ischemic and all hemorrhagic strokes patients an etiology non-related with COVID-19 was identified.

Multiple reports suggest that severe COVID-19 infection is associated with an increased thromboembolic risk. There are limited data associating a hypercoagulable ROTEM profile and outcomes in the literature. A hypercoagulable ROTEM profile could help identify patients at risk of worse outcome and help target a study population for enhanced anticoagulation therapy or other COVID-19 therapy. Objectives: To determine if early hypercoagulability on ROTEM is associated with a higher risk of thromboembolic complications or worse outcome, in a population of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients transferred to a tertiary ARDS/ECMO referral center. Methods: All COVID-19 patients receiving mechanical ventilation at our center between April 3 and June 15, 2020 were assessed with ROTEM. Testing performed included at least ExTEM and FibTEM. Patients were classified as hypercoagulable (HC) or not (nHC) using the following criteria from ROTEM: ExTEM clot formation time (E_CFT)< 40 sec, alpha (∝) angle >79° and, either ExTEM or FibTEM maximum clot firmness (E_MCF or F_MCF) >70mm or >24mm, respectively. Outcomes, assessed at discharge from our ICU, included thromboembolic events (TE: composite of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and ischemic stroke), acute kidney injury (AKI: AKIN stage >2 with or without dialysis), duration of mechanical ventilation, requirement for ECMO, and death. Difference between groups was determined using the chi-square or Fisher-exact test for categorical data and a t-test for continuous variables respectively, using p<0.05 as significant. Results: Of 59 patients included, 31 were hypercoagulable (HC) on admission. Mean (SD) age was 52 (14), and SOFA score on admission was high 15 (2). The severity of disease was similar in both groups especially for the cardiac and respiratory SOFA components (Table 1). The composite outcome of TE was not different between the groups (HC 9/31, nHC 6/28, p=0.7). The composite renal outcome was not different (HC 18/31 vs nHC 16/28). Mortality rate (29%, HC 9 vs nHC 8), and the duration of ventilation in survivors (HC 22 vs nHC 22 days) were similar in both groups. Requirement for ECMO support was similar (HC 8 vs nHC 12, p= 0.27). Patients were tested with daily viscoelastic tests and, neither fibrinolysis nor DIC were documented. All patients received TE prophylaxis and 34 received therapeutic intravenous heparin for ECMO (n=20) or TE treatment (n=14). Initial ROTEM were conducted on therapeutic heparin in 22 cases (12 HC, 10 nHC). Conclusion: Our data suggest that in a population of mechanically ventilated patients with severe COVID-19, an early hypercoagulable profile on ROTEM was not associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events, AKI, prolonged ventilation, ECMO or death during their ICU stay.

We investigated the therapeutic effect of HY1702, a new small molecule diterpene obtained from the processing and modification of Glaucocalyxin A and may exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. Specifically, we studied the anti-inflammatory effects of HY1702 on lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory responses in RAW264.7 and THP-1 cells in vitro and its protective efficacy on lipopolysaccharide-induced mild acute respiratory distress syndrome in mice. Our results showed that HY1702 significantly decreased lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory cytokine expression in RAW264.7 and THP-1 cells and attenuated the secretion of nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 by down-regulating the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase 2 in RAW264.7 cells. In mice with lipopolysaccharide-induced mild acute respiratory distress syndrome, HY1702 alleviated histological alterations in the lungs and reduced the alveolar cavity protein leakage and inflammatory cytokine expression in murine bronchial alveolar lavage fluid. HY1702 decreased the myeloperoxidase activity and lung wet to dry weight ratio. In our mechanism studies in lipopolysaccharide-exposed RAW264.7 cells, HY1702 suppressed the inflammation stimulated by lipopolysaccharide through inhibiting phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase subunit α/β (IKKα/β) and inhibitor of nuclear factor κB subunit α (IκBα), further affecting the nuclear transfer of phosphorylated p65. Meanwhile, phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was inhibited. These data suggest that HY1702 can reduce inflammation on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages and attenuate the symptoms of mild acute respiratory distress syndrome in a murine model by regulating the nuclear factor κB and MAP kinase signalling pathways.","Wang, Mengfei; Zhang, Tong; Li, Ling; Xie, Qing; Wang, Yanping; Li, Yunsen; Chen, Zijun",Eur J Pharmacol,5,1

SUMMARY ANSWER: Yes, using a combination of three different models we can predict the impact of delaying access to treatment by 6 and 12 months on the probability of conception leading to live birth in women of different age groups with different categories of infertility. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Increased age and duration of infertility can prejudice the chances of success following IVF, but couples with unexplained infertility have a chance of conceiving naturally without treatment whilst waiting for IVF. The worldwide suspension of IVF could lead to worse outcomes in couples awaiting treatment, but it is unclear to what extent this could affect individual couples based on age and cause of infertility. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A population based cohort study based on national data from all licensed clinics in the UK obtained from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority Register. Linked data from 9589 women who underwent their first IVF or ICSI treatment in 2017 and consented to the use of their data for research were used to predict livebirth numbers. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Three prediction models were used to estimate the chances of livebirth associated with immediate treatment versus a delay of 6 and 12 months in couples about to embark on IVF or ICSI. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We estimated that a 6-month delay would reduce livebirths by 0.4%, 2.4%, 5.7%, 9.5% and 11.8% in women aged <30, 30-35, 36-37, 38-39 and 40-42 years, respectively, while corresponding values associated with a delay of 12 months were 0.9%, 4.9%, 11.9%, 18.8% and 22.4%, respectively. In women with known causes of infertility, worst case (best case) predicted chances of livebirth after a delay of 6 months in women aged <30, 30-35, 36-37, 38-39 and 40-42 years varied between 31.6% (35.0%), 29.0% (31.6%), 23.1% (25.2%), 17.2% (19.4%) and 10.3% (12.3%) for tubal infertility and 34.3% (39.2%), 31.6% (35.3%) 25.2%(28.5%) 18.3% (21.3%), and 11.3% (14.1%) for male factor infertility. The corresponding values in those treated immediately were 31.7%, 29.8%, 24.5%, 19.0% and 11.7% for tubal factor and 34.4%, 32.4%, 26.7%, 20.2% and 12.8% in male factor infertility. In women with unexplained infertility the predicted chances of livebirth after a delay of 6 months followed by one complete IVF cycle were 41.0%, 36.6%, 29.4%, 22.4% and 15.1% in women aged <30, 30-35, 36-37, 38-39 and 40-42 years, respectively, compared to 34.9%, 32.5%, 26.9%, 20.7% and 13.2% in similar groups of women treated without any delay. The additional waiting period, which provided more time for spontaneous conception, was predicted to increase the relative number of babies born by 17.5%, 12.6%, 9.1%, 8.4% and 13.8%, in women aged <30, 30-35, 36-37, 38-39 and 40-42 years, respectively. A 12-month delay showed a similar pattern in all subgroups. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Major sources of uncertainty include the use of prediction models generated in different populations and the need for a number of assumptions. Although the models are validated and the bases for the assumptions are robust, it is impossible to eliminate the possibility of imprecision in our predictions. Therefore, our predicted live birth rates need to be validated in prospective studies to confirm their accuracy. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: A delay in starting IVF reduces success rates in all couples. For the first time, we have shown that while this results in fewer babies in older women and those with a known cause of infertility, it has a less detrimental effect on couples with unexplained infertility, some of whom conceive naturally whilst waiting for treatment. Post COVID 19, clinics planning a phased return to normal clinical services should prioritise older women and those with a known cause of infertility.

Many studies have established that MITA/STING is a central component in the innate immune response to cytosolic DNA and RNA derived from pathogens. MITA can act both as a direct sensor of cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) and as an adaptor for the recruitment of downstream signaling components. In both roles, MITA is part of signaling cascades that orchestrate innate immune defenses against various pathogens, including viruses, bacteria and parasites.

Continued pharmacovigilance is integral to mitigating the risk of rare adverse events that clinical trials are underpowered to detect, however, these anecdotal reports have led to the pause or withdrawal of some vaccines in many jurisdictions and exacerbated vaccine hesitancy at a critical moment in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated the frequencies of CVST seen among individuals who received FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech (n = 94,818 doses), Moderna (n = 36,350 doses) and Johnson & Johnson - J&J (n = 1,745 doses), and among individuals receiving one of 10 FDA-approved non-COVID-19 vaccines (n = 771,805 doses). Comparing the incidence rates of CVST in 30-day time windows before and after vaccination, we found no statistically significant differences for the COVID-19 vaccines or any other vaccines studied in this population. In total, we observed 3 cases of CVST within the 30 days following Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination (2 females, 1 male; Ages (years): [79, 80, 84]), including one individual with a prior history of thrombosis and another individual with recent trauma in the past 30 days. We did not observe any cases of CVST among the patients receiving Moderna or J&J vaccines in this study population. We further found the baseline CVST incidence in the study population between 2017 and 2021 to be 45 to 98 per million patient years. Overall, this real-world evidence-based study highlights that CVST is rare and is not significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, there is a need for a concerted international effort to monitor EHR data across diverse patient populations and to investigate the underlying biological mechanisms leading to these rare clotting events.","Pawlowski, C.; Rincon-Hekking, J.; Awasthi, S.; Pandey, V.; Lenehan, P.; Venkatakrishnan, A.; Bade, S.; OHoro, J.

In 2013, the STOCK Act, which was initially passed to mitigate insider trading by government officials, was quickly and unexpectedly amended to allow certain government employees to withhold their financial information. To identify and quantify the potential costs placed on investors by non-corporate insider traders, we use the unusual circumstances surrounding this amendment. For a sample of stocks most held by members of Congress, we find that, relative to control stocks, liquidity significantly worsens and volatility increases during the post-amendment period. Our results highlight the costs that are incurred by investors in the presence of non-corporate insider trading. These findings call for a stronger development of an ethical framework that justifies the restriction of all types of insider trading.","Blau, Benjamin M.; Griffith, Todd G.; Whitby, Ryan J.",J Bus Ethics,5,10

OBJECTIVES: Measure the period prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among a random sample of asymptomatic health system hospital-based health care workers (HCWs) 6½ -15½ weeks after 4/5/2020, the peak of the first surge of COVID-19 admissions. RESULTS: Of 524 eligible and consented participants from four metropolitan hospitals, nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from 439 (83.8%) and blood from 374 (71.4%). Using PCR nucleic acid-based amplification (NAAT) methods, the period prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.23% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01%-1.28%; 1/439) from 5/21/20-7/16/20. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies from June 17-July 24, 2020 was 2.41% (95% CI 1.27%-4.51%; 9/374). Those who were reactive were younger (median age 36 versus 44 years; p = 0.050), and those with self-reported Hispanic/Latino ethnicity had a higher seroprevalence rate (2/12 = 16.7% versus 7/352 = 2.0%; p = 0.051). There were no significant differences by sex, race, residence, hospital, unit or job type. The one employee who was found to be PCR test positive in this study was also reactive for IgG antibodies, tested 27 days later. CONCLUSIONS: The period prevalence of PCR positivity to SARS-CoV-2 and IgG seroprevalence was unexpectedly low in asymptomatic HCWs after a peak in COVID-19 admissions and the establishment of state and institutional infection control policies, suggesting that routine screening tests while community prevalence is relatively low would produce a minimal yield.","Johnson, Christine C.; Coleman, Chad M.; Sitarik, Alexandra R.; Leon, Joyce E.; Tibbetts, Robert J.; Cook, Bernard C.; Muma, Bruce K.; Weinmann, Allison J.; Samuel, Linoj P.",J Clin Virol,5,26

Lack of knowledge of the biological mechanisms of viruses, plus the absence of effective treatments against the disease (COVID-19) and/or vaccines have pulled factors that can compromise the proper functioning of the immune system to fight against infectious diseases into the spotlight. The optimal status of specific nutrients is considered crucial to keeping immune components within their normal activity, helping to avoid and overcome infections. Specifically, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) evaluated and deems six vitamins (D, A, C, Folate, B(6), B(12)) and four minerals (zinc, iron, copper and selenium) to be essential for the normal functioning of the immune system, due to the scientific evidence collected so far. In this report, an update on the evidence of the contribution of nutritional factors as immune-enhancing aspects, factors that could reduce their bioavailability, and the role of the optimal status of these nutrients within the COVID-19 pandemic context was carried out. First, a non-systematic review of the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of an optimal nutritional status of these nutrients on the proper functioning of the immune system as well as their potential role in COVID-19 prevention/treatment was carried out by searching for available scientific evidence in PubMed and LitCovid databases. Second, a compilation from published sources and an analysis of nutritional data from 10 European countries was performed, and the relationship between country nutritional status and epidemiological COVID-19 data (available in the Worldometers database) was evaluated following an ecological study design. Furthermore, the potential effect of genetics was considered through the selection of genetic variants previously identified in Genome-Wide Association studies (GWAs) as influencing the nutritional status of these 10 considered nutrients. Therefore, access to genetic information in accessible databases (1000genomes, by Ensembl) of individuals from European populations enabled an approximation that countries might present a greater risk of suboptimal status of the nutrients studied. Results from the review approach show the importance of maintaining a correct nutritional status of these 10 nutrients analyzed for the health of the immune system, highlighting the importance of Vitamin D and iron in the context of COVID-19. Besides, the ecological study demonstrates that intake levels of relevant micronutrients—especially Vitamins D, C, B(12), and iron—are inversely associated with higher COVID-19 incidence and/or mortality, particularly in populations genetically predisposed to show lower micronutrient status. In conclusion, nutrigenetic data provided by joint assessment of 10 essential nutrients for the functioning of the immune system and of the genetic factors that can limit their bioavailability can be a fundamental tool to help strengthen the immune system of individuals and prepare populations to fight against infectious diseases such as COVID-19.","Galmés, Sebastià; Serra, Francisca; Palou, Andreu",Nutrients,5,22

Despite preliminary studies revealed that patients with cancer are more susceptible to infection and have poorer prognosis than other infected patients without cancer, mortality from COVID-19 in cancer patients appears to be principally driven by age, gender, and comorbidities. So, we have some comments about the pathogenesis attributed to the COVID-19 disease and cancer relationship and determination of subgroups in this and oncoming studies. Variable effects of anticancer treatments on the patient's immune system are yet to be elucidated. On the other hand, the effect of SARS-CoV-2 virus on tumor microenvironment or immune responses in cancer is not yet fully proven. Very recently, Challenor and her colleague reported a case with classical Hodgkin lymphoma with stage IIIs disease, which went into remission without corticosteroid or immunochemotherapy. They assumed that the putative mechanisms of action include cross-reactivity of pathogen-specific T cells with tumor antigens and natural killer cell activation by inflammatory cytokines produced in response to infection.

Several HERV genes have been detected as transcripts and proteins in the central nervous system, frequently in the context of neuroinflammation. The HERV-W family has received substantial attention in large part because of associations with diverse syndromes including multiple sclerosis (MS) and several psychiatric disorders. A HERV-W-related retroelement, multiple sclerosis retrovirus (MSRV), has been reported in MS patients to be both a biomarker as well as an effector of aberrant immune responses. HERV-H and HERV-K have also been implicated in MS and other neurological diseases but await delineation of their contributions to disease. The HERV-W envelope-encoded glycosylated protein, syncytin-1, is encoded by chromosome 7q21 and exhibits increased glial expression within MS lesions. Overexpression of syncytin-1 in glia induces endoplasmic reticulum stress leading to neuroinflammation and the induction of free radicals, which damage proximate cells. Syncytin-1's receptor, ASCT1 is a neutral amino acid transporter expressed on glia and is suppressed in white matter of MS patients. Of interest, antioxidants ameliorate syncytin-1's neuropathogenic effects raising the possibility of using these agents as therapeutics for neuroinflammatory diseases. Given the multiple insertion sites of HERV genes as complete and incomplete open reading frames, together with their differing capacity to be expressed and the complexities of individual HERVs as both disease markers and bioactive effectors, HERV biology is a compelling area for understanding neuropathogenic mechanisms and developing new therapeutic strategies.","Antony, Joseph M.; DesLauriers, Andre M.; Bhat, Rakesh K.; Ellestad, Kristofer K.; Power, Christopher",Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease,5,16

While immune dysregulation can be attributed to several factors, the risk of associated thrombogenic disruption varies across individuals. This variation depends on several factors, such as comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. When considering ethnic variations, the vulnerability of Caucasians, African Americans and Hispanics needs to be addressed before arriving at strategies to handle thromboembolic complications, which have been identified in recent reports as the leading causes of mortality in COVID-19. Although evaluation of D-dimer and prothrombin during admission is considered to predict prognosis and mortality, there are no preventive or prophylactic strategies before hospital admission. Herein, we present our perspectives on the effect of regular supplementation with the biological response modifier beta glucan based on its relevance to immune modulation. This effect is of paramount importance in decreasing the development of severe COVID-19 and reducing mortality against the background of coagulopathy, especially in vulnerable populations.","Ikewaki, Nobunao; Rao, Kosagi-Sharaf; Archibold, Armando Durant; Iwasaki, Masaru; Senthilkumar, Rajappa; Preethy, Senthilkumar; Katoh, Shojiro; Abraham, Samuel J.

Viral aetiology is the most common. Among bacterial causes, the main agent is Streptococcus pyogenes or group A β-haemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), which causes 5%-30% of the episodes. In the diagnostic process, clinical assessment scales can help clinicians to better predict suspected bacterial aetiology by selecting patients who should undergo a rapid antigen detection test. If these techniques are not performed, an overdiagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis often occurs, resulting in unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics, most of which are broad spectrum. Consequently, management algorithms that include the use of predictive clinical rules and rapid tests have been set up. The aim of the treatment is speeding up symptom resolution, reducing the contagious time span and preventing local suppurative and non-suppurative complications. Penicillin and amoxicillin are the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of pharyngitis. The association of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not indicated as the initial treatment of acute infection. Neither are macrolides indicated as first-line therapy; they should be reserved for patients allergic to penicillin.

Patient desaturated to low 80s requiring intubation for airway protection and hypoxemic respiratory failure. Anterior nasal packing was performed. The COVID-19 test resulted negative. Extubation was unsuccessful on days four and nine. The patient subsequently underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient was transferred to sub-acute rehabilitation with a tracheostomy tube on minimal ventilator support. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended obtaining an NP swab in COVID-19 suspects to test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR).A study found that NP swabbing was associated with epistaxis in approximately 5-10% of the cases. Nursing home populations are at higher risk for COVID-19 and also reported to have increased use of oral anticoagulation for chronic atrial fibrillation with other co-morbidities (high CHADVASc score) which may increase bleeding risk with NP swabbing. Less invasive methods such as salivary and mid-turbinate sampling, nasal swab or saliva can be a better alternative sample for detecting SARS-CoV-2 as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and suggested by FDA. Positive PCR testing beyond nine days of illness is likely due to persistent dead virus particles and thus repeat testing is not suggested. Obtaining a history of bleeding diathesis, use of oral anticoagulants and consideration of NP anatomy is advised before swabbing. This case report raises the concern against inadvertent NP swabbing in cases with a low pretest probability of COVID-19 infection with higher bleeding risk.","Khanal, Resha; Oli, Sharad; Lawal, Halimat; Bhandari, Binita; Komanduri, Saketram",Cureus,5,16

The characteristics of this complication, with venous thromboses at unusual sites, most frequently cerebral vein sinus but also splanchnic, often multiple associated thromboses, thrombocytopenia, and sometimes disseminated intravascular coagulation, are unique and the time course and tumultuous evolution are suggestive of an acute immunological reaction, and indeed platelet-activating anti-PF4 antibodies have been detected in a large fraction of the affected patients. Several data suggest that adenoviruses may interact with platelets, the endothelium and the blood coagulation system. Here we review the interactions between adenoviral vectors and the haemostatic system of possible relevance for the vaccine associated thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome, we analyse systematically the clinical data on the reported thrombotic complications of adenovirus-based therapeutics and discuss all the current hypotheses on the mechanisms triggering this novel syndrome. Although considering current evidence the benefit of vaccination clearly outweighs the potential risks, it is of paramount importance to fully unravel the mechanisms leading to the vaccine associated thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome and to identify prognostic factors through further research.","Gresele, Paolo; Momi, Stefania; Marcucci, Rossella; Ramundo, Francesco; De Stefano, Valerio; Tripodi, Armando",Haematologica,5,5

However, the underlying risk factors for the development of cardiovascular related manifestations are unclear. MethodsUsing a register-based multi-center cross-sectional design, we analyzed 80 patients with myocardial injury and 401 controls, as well as 71 patients with arrhythmia and 409 controls, all admitted with COVID-19. Putative risk factors for myocardial injury and arrhythmia were evaluated with logistic regression with adjustment for potential confounders. ResultsCOVID-19 patients with myocardial injury had fatigue (66.2%) and dyspnea (63.7%), while those with arrhythmia had dyspnea (71.8%). Patients with myocardial injury and arrhythmia had a significant mortality of 92.5% and 94.4%, respectively. A history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart diseases was associated with an increased risk of myocardial injury (odds ratio [OR] = 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-3.71; OR = 7.43, 95% CI: 3.99-13.83) and arrhythmia (OR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.00-3.75; OR = 13.16, 95% CI: 6.75-25.68).

SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with the development of cytokine storm (including interleukin 6 (IL-6)), which can cause lung damage and lack of oxygen. Tocilizumab (TCZ) inhibits ligand binding to the IL-6 receptor and may be a potential treatment for the hyperinflammation symptoms of COVID-19. However, data regarding the efficacy of TCZ in COVID-19 are lacking. The rapid spread of the pandemic in France, especially in the Paris region, constrained us to the off-label use of TCZ in patients with severe clinical conditions. METHODS: A single-centre observational cohort study of 44 patients infected with COVID-19 was carried out between 6 April and 21 April 2020 in Groupe Hospitalier Intercommunal Le Raincy-Montfermeil (GHILRM). Twenty-two patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were treated with TCZ and were compared with 22 patients not treated with TCZ matched for age, gender and length of hospital stay for COVID-19. Respiratory rate and oxygen supplementation as well as laboratory parameters (such as C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) were collected at baseline and during 14 days of follow-up. Our primary objective was to assess the efficacy of TCZ on respiratory clinical conditions. FINDINGS: The average respiratory rate was lower in the TCZ group than in the control group (21.5 vs 25.5 breaths/min at day 14, 95% CI −7.5 to −0.4; p=0.03). Treated patients tended to be intubated less during the course of the disease (2/22 vs 6/22, 95% CI −0.4 to 0.1; p=0.12). In each group, 10 patients no longer required oxygen therapy. We found a significant decrease in CRP in treated patients on day 7 (p=0.04). TCZ caused cytolysis in more than half (14/22) of the patients but without clinical impact. INTERPRETATION: There was a significant difference in the respiratory rate on day 14 of follow-up, with a greater decrease observed in the treated group. Fewer patients required mechanical ventilation in the TCZ group, especially among patients with more extensive CT lung damage, than in the control group. The same number of patients were weaned off oxygen on day 14 in the two groups, while the patients in the TCZ group had more severe impairment at inclusion. We consider that TCZ showed significant control of the biological inflammatory syndrome, suggesting that it may limit the effect of the cytokine storm. Our study seems to indicate the efficacy of TCZ, particularly in patients with severe initial pulmonary impairment. Selecting the best candidates and the best timing for TCZ therapy needs to be determined in randomised clinical trials.","Albertini, Laetitia; Soletchnik, Mickael; Razurel, Anais; Cohen, Johana; Bidegain, Frédéric; Fauvelle, Francis; Safrano, Geoffroy; Piquet, Jacques; Maurer, Cyril; Goldgran-Toledano, Dany",Eur J Hosp Pharm,5,29

We evaluated the trajectories of clinical and laboratory parameters in hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We used data from adult HD patients treated at an integrated kidney disease company who received a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) test to investigate suspicion of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection between May 1 and September 1, 2020. Nonparametric smoothing splines were used to fit data for individual trajectories and estimate the mean change over time in patients testing positive or negative for SARS‐CoV‐2 and those who survived or died within 30 days of first suspicion or positive test date. For each clinical parameter of interest, the difference in average daily changes between COVID‐19 positive versus negative group and COVID‐19 survivor versus nonsurvivor group was estimated by fitting a linear mixed effects model based on measurements in the 14 days before (i.e., Day −14 to Day 0) Day 0. RESULTS: There were 12,836 HD patients with a suspicion of COVID‐19 who received RT‐PCR testing (8895 SARS‐CoV‐2 positive). We observed significantly different trends (p < 0.05) in pre‐HD systolic blood pressure (SBP), pre‐HD pulse rate, body temperature, ferritin, neutrophils, lymphocytes, albumin, and interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) between COVID‐19 positive and negative patients. For COVID‐19 positive group, we observed significantly different clinical trends (p < 0.05) in pre‐HD pulse rate, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and albumin between survivors and nonsurvivors. We also observed that, in the group of survivors, most clinical parameters returned to pre‐COVID‐19 levels within 60–90 days. CONCLUSION: We observed unique temporal trends in various clinical and laboratory parameters among HD patients who tested positive versus negative for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and those who survived the infection versus those who died. These trends can help to define the physiological disturbances that characterize the onset and course of COVID‐19 in HD patients.","Chaudhuri, Sheetal; Lasky, Rachel; Jiao, Yue; Larkin, John; Monaghan, Caitlin; Winter, Anke; Neri, Luca; Kotanko, Peter; Hymes, Jeffrey; Lee, Sangho; Wang, Yuedong; Kooman, Jeroen P.; Maddux, Franklin; Usvyat, Len",Hemodial Int,5,6

The purpose of this retrospective observational study was to investigate the outcomes of emergency resuscitation after implementation of ICMs. Data were collected for the period 1 January to 4 July in 2003 from a 1732-bed tertiary care hospital in central Taiwan. Non-trauma patients who required emergency resuscitation were classified into two groups: before (period 1), and after (period 2), the date on which strict ICMs were implemented. The analysis variables included demographic data of patients, place of resuscitation, number of participating resuscitators, response time and duration of resuscitation, fever, pneumonia status and results of resuscitation. The response time was unchanged but the number of patient resuscitations without an emergency intubation, rapid sequence intubation or a ‘do not resuscitate’ order increased from 88 (24.4%), 23 (6.4%) and 16 (4.4%) in period 1 to 103 (33.0%), 32 (10.3%) and 29 (9.3%) in period 2, respectively. The failure rate of resuscitation was significantly higher in period 2 (odds ratio: 1.59, 95% confidence interval: 1.17–2.16). The number of emergency resuscitations in patients with fever or pneumonia was not significantly different between these two periods. In conclusion, strict ICM implementation appeared to play a role in the increased failure rate in emergency resuscitation. Normal provision of healthcare to patients and adequate protection of healthcare workers during emergency resuscitation will be of paramount importance during the next outbreak of a highly contagious disease.","Chuang, H.-L.; Leung, W.-S.; Chung, Y.-T.; Chang, Y.-T.; Chen, W.-K.",J Hosp Infect,5,33

Our previous microarray analysis showed that H9N2 virus infection and inactivated viral particle inoculation increased the expression of interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In present study, we deeply investigated the expression patterns of IFITM1 and IFITM1-mediated antiviral response induced by H9N2 virus infection and inactivated viral particle inoculation in HUVECs. Epithelial cells that are considered target cells of the influenza virus were selected as a reference control. METHODS: First, we quantified the expression levels of IFITM1 in HUVECs induced by H9N2 virus infection or viral particle inoculation using quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Second, we observed whether hemagglutinin or neuraminidase affected IFITM1 expression in HUVECs. Finally, we investigated the effect of induced-IFITM1 on the antiviral state in HUVECs by siRNA and activation plasmid transfection. RESULTS: Both H9N2 virus infection and viral particle inoculation increased the expression of IFITM1 without elevating the levels of interferon-ɑ/β in HUVECs. HA or NA protein binding alone is not sufficient to increase the levels of IFITM1 and interferon-ɑ/β in HUVECs. IFITM1 induced by viral particle inoculation significantly decreased the virus titers in culture supernatants of HUVECs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that inactivated viral particle inoculation increased the expression of IFITM1 at mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, the induction of IFITM1 expression mediated the antiviral state in HUVECs.","Feng, Bo; Zhao, Lihong; Wang, Wei; Wang, Jianfang; Wang, Hongyan; Duan, Huiqin; Zhang, Jianjun; Qiao, Jian",Virol J,5,22

Recent research suggests that this seasonality in children is primarily related to viral respiratory tract infections. Regular hand washing is the most effective method to prevent the spread of viral respiratory infections; unfortunately, achieving hand washing recommendations in schools is difficult. Therefore, we designed a study to evaluate the effect of hand sanitizer use in elementary schools on exacerbations among children with asthma. Purpose To describe the process of redesigning the trial in response to changes in the safety profile of the hand sanitizer as well as changes in hand hygiene practice in the schools. Methods The original trial was a randomized, longitudinal, subject-blinded, placebo-controlled, community-based crossover trial. The primary aim was to evaluate the incremental effectiveness of hand sanitizer use in addition to usual hand hygiene practices to decrease asthma exacerbations in elementary-age children. Three events occurred that required major modifications to the original study protocol: (1) safety concerns arose regarding the hand sanitizer’s active ingredient; (2) no substitute placebo hand sanitizer was available; and (3) community preferences changed regarding hand hygiene practices in the schools. Results The revised protocol is a randomized, longitudinal, community-based crossover trial. The primary aim is to evaluate the incremental effectiveness of a two-step hand hygiene process (hand hygiene education plus institutionally provided alcohol-based hand sanitizer) versus usual care to decrease asthma exacerbations. Enrollment was completed in May 2009 with 527 students from 30 schools. The intervention began in August 2009 and will continue through May 2011. Study results should be available at the end of 2011. Limitations The changed design does not allow us to directly measure the effectiveness of hand sanitizer use as a supplement to traditional hand washing practices. Conclusions The need to balance a rigorous study design with one that is acceptable to the community requires investigators to be actively involved with community collaborators and able to adapt study protocols to fit changing community practices.","Gerald, Lynn B; Gerald, Joe K; McClure, Leslie A; Harrington, Kathy; Erwin, Sue; Bailey, William C",Clin Trials,5,22

However, due to the vulnerability of critically ill patients, invasive diagnostic methods should be performed with caution in the intensive care unit (ICU). It would be helpful if the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical impact of virus detection are elucidated. METHODS: We evaluated patients with severe pneumonia between January 1(st) 2008 and December 31(st) 2015. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed for 8 respiratory viruses when viral pathogen could not be excluded as the origin of severe pneumonia. The baseline characteristics, laboratory results, microbiological findings, and clinical outcomes of the patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 2,347 patients admitted to the medical ICU, 515 underwent RT-PCR for respiratory viruses, 69 of whom had positive results. The detection rate was higher during the winter, with a community onset, in patients with history of recent chemotherapy, and low platelet count. Additional bronchoscopic sampling along with upper respiratory specimen increased the yield of viral detection. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most common pathogen detected, while influenza A was the most common virus with bacterial coinfection. Respiratory virus detection led to changes in clinical management in one-third of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of viral pathogens in patients with severe pneumonia is not rare, and can be more common in certain group of patients. Invasive sampling for RT-PCR can be helpful, and such detection can lead to positive changes in clinical management.","Kim, Hyung-Jun; Choi, Sun Mi; Lee, Jinwoo; Park, Young Sik; Lee, Chang-Hoon; Yim, Jae-Joon; Yoo, Chul-Gyu; Kim, Young Whan; Han, Sung Koo; Lee, Sang-Min",PLoS One,5,1

Some of these factors can originate from the physical learning environment (PLE) in this regard. When learning from home, learners have to organize their PLE by themselves. This paper is concerned with identifying, measuring, and collecting factors from the PLE that may affect learning using mobile sensing. More specifically, this paper first investigates which factors from the PLE can affect distance learning. The results identify nine types of factors from the PLE associated with cognitive, physiological, and affective effects on learning. Subsequently, this paper examines which instruments can be used to measure the investigated factors. The results highlight several methods involving smart wearables (SWs) to measure these factors from PLEs successfully. Third, this paper explores how software infrastructure can be designed to measure, collect, and process the identified multimodal data from and about the PLE by utilizing mobile sensing. The design and implementation of the Edutex software infrastructure described in this paper will enable learning analytics stakeholders to use data from and about the learners’ physical contexts. Edutex achieves this by utilizing sensor data from smartphones and smartwatches, in addition to response data from experience samples and questionnaires from learners’ smartwatches. Finally, this paper evaluates to what extent the developed infrastructure can provide relevant information about the learning context in a field study with 10 participants. The evaluation demonstrates how the software infrastructure can contextualize multimodal sensor data, such as lighting, ambient noise, and location, with user responses in a reliable, efficient, and protected manner.","Ciordas-Hertel, George-Petru; Rödling, Sebastian; Schneider, Jan; Di Mitri, Daniele; Weidlich, Joshua; Drachsler, Hendrik",Sensors (Basel),5,20

Over 128 million people have been infected with it and 2.8 million deaths have already taken place, till 30th March 2021. The identification of materials positive cases is the first step towards its containment and treatment. However, testing of individuals is an extensive, expensive and time-consuming exercise. In addition, societal taboos are also associated with infected individuals resulting in very few people volunteering for testing, esp. in the developing and under-developed world. An alternative approach that circumvents individual testing is the wastewater-based epidemiology. A state-of-the-art review of this method is provided in context of its utility for COVID-19 detection. This technique relies on collecting and testing samples from sewers and/or wastewater treatment plants for the presence of pathogens and then using that data to determine and predict the spread of the infection, thereby allowing the provision of appropriate containment and treatment steps. The study covers key aspects of wastewater-based epidemiology application for COVID-19 detection including its need, detailed process of detection and assessment, data analysis, economics and challenges to its application. Findings from a number of case studies are presented to elucidate the utility of this technique. It is clearly seen that WBE-based approach is a much better strategy as compared to individual testing and can be adopted to prevent further spread of Covid-19. The work is expected to further emphasize the application of this method for COVID (and other pandemic) detection and implementing containment strategies. This is clearly a much more economical and non-intrusive approach as compared to the individual testing.","Saini, G.; Deepak, P. S.",Global Journal of Environmental Science and Management,5,3

It is expected that many patients will add other symptomatic/adjuvant treatments, such as herbal medicines. AIMS: To provide a benefits/risks assessment of selected herbal medicines traditionally indicated for “respiratory diseases” within the current frame of the COVID-19 pandemic as an adjuvant treatment. METHOD: The plant selection was primarily based on species listed by the WHO and EMA, but some other herbal remedies were considered due to their widespread use in respiratory conditions. Preclinical and clinical data on their efficacy and safety were collected from authoritative sources. The target population were adults with early and mild flu symptoms without underlying conditions. These were evaluated according to a modified PrOACT-URL method with paracetamol, ibuprofen, and codeine as reference drugs. The benefits/risks balance of the treatments was classified as positive, promising, negative, and unknown. RESULTS: A total of 39 herbal medicines were identified as very likely to appeal to the COVID-19 patient. According to our method, the benefits/risks assessment of the herbal medicines was found to be positive in 5 cases (Althaea officinalis, Commiphora molmol, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Hedera helix, and Sambucus nigra), promising in 12 cases (Allium sativum, Andrographis paniculata, Echinacea angustifolia, Echinacea purpurea, Eucalyptus globulus essential oil, Justicia pectoralis, Magnolia officinalis, Mikania glomerata, Pelargonium sidoides, Pimpinella anisum, Salix sp, Zingiber officinale), and unknown for the rest. On the same grounds, only ibuprofen resulted promising, but we could not find compelling evidence to endorse the use of paracetamol and/or codeine. CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that several herbal medicines have safety margins superior to those of reference drugs and enough levels of evidence to start a clinical discussion about their potential use as adjuvants in the treatment of early/mild common flu in otherwise healthy adults within the context of COVID-19. While these herbal medicines will not cure or prevent the flu, they may both improve general patient well-being and offer them an opportunity to personalize the therapeutic approaches.","Silveira, Dâmaris; Prieto-Garcia, Jose Maria; Boylan, Fabio; Estrada, Omar; Fonseca-Bazzo, Yris Maria; Jamal, Claudia Masrouah; Magalhães, Pérola Oliveira; Pereira, Edson Oliveira; Tomczyk, Michal; Heinrich, Michael",Front Pharmacol,5,18

Harm reduction techniques such as fentanyl testing strips, naloxone education and distribution, drug sampling behaviors, and supervised injection facilities are all seeing expanded use with increasing amounts of research being published regarding their effectiveness. Availability and use of interventions such as medication for opioid use disorder and peer recovery coaching programs are also on the rise to prevent opioid overdose.

While the most severe of these cases require renal replacement therapy (RRT), little is known about their clinical course. METHODS: We describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in the ICU with AKI requiring RRT at an academic medical center in New York City and followed patients for outcomes of death and renal recovery using time-to-event analyses. RESULTS: Our cohort of 115 patients represented 23% of all ICU admissions at our center, with a peak prevalence of 29%. Patients were followed for a median of 29 days (2542 total patient-RRT-days; median 54 days for survivors). Mechanical ventilation and vasopressor use were common (99% and 84%, respectively), and the median Sequential Organ Function Assessment (SOFA) score was 14. By the end of follow-up 51% died, 41% recovered kidney function (84% of survivors), and 8% still needed RRT (survival probability at 60 days: 0.46 [95% CI: 0.36–0.56])). In an adjusted Cox model, coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were associated with increased mortality (HRs: 3.99 [95% CI 1.46–10.90] and 3.10 [95% CI 1.25–7.66]) as were angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (HR 2.33 [95% CI 1.21–4.47]) and a SOFA score >15 (HR 3.46 [95% CI 1.65–7.25). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our analysis demonstrates the high prevalence of AKI requiring RRT among critically ill patients with COVID-19 and is associated with a high mortality, however, the rate of renal recovery is high among survivors and should inform shared-decision making.","Stevens, Jacob S.; King, Kristen L.; Robbins-Juarez, Shelief Y.; Khairallah, Pascale; Toma, Katherine; Alvarado Verduzco, Hector; Daniel, Emily; Douglas, Denzil; Moses, Andrew A.; Peleg, Yonatan; Starakiewicz, Piotr; Li, Miah T.; Kim, Daniel W.; Yu, Kathleen; Qian, Long; Shah, Vaqar H.; O'Donnell, Max R.; Cummings, Matthew J.; Zucker, Jason; Natarajan, Karthik; Perotte, Adler; Tsapepas, Demetra; Krzysztof, Kiryluk; Dube, Geoffrey; Siddall, Eric; Shirazian, Shayan; Nickolas, Thomas L.; Rao, Maya K.; Barasch, Jonathan M.; Valeri, Anthony M.; Radhakrishnan, Jai; Gharavi, Ali G.; Husain, S.

However, the distribution of ACE2 in the brain is still obscure. Here we investigated the ACE2 expression in the brain by analyzing data from publicly available brain transcriptome databases. According to our spatial distribution analysis, ACE2 was relatively highly expressed in some brain locations, such as the choroid plexus and paraventricular nuclei of the thalamus. According to cell-type distribution analysis, nuclear expression of ACE2 was found in many neurons (both excitatory and inhibitory neurons) and some non-neuron cells (mainly astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells) in human middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex. A few ACE2-expressing nuclei were found in a hippocampal dataset, and none were detected in the prefrontal cortex. Except for the additional high expression of Ace2 in the olfactory bulb areas for spatial distribution as well as in the pericytes and endothelial cells for cell-type distribution, the distribution of Ace2 in mouse brain was similar to that in the human brain. Thus, our results reveal an outline of ACE2/Ace2 distribution in the human and mouse brain, which indicates the brain infection of SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of inducing central nervous system symptoms in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Potential species differences should be considered when using mouse models to study the neurological effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Chen, Rongrong; Wang, Keer; Yu, Jie; Howard, Derek; French, Leon; Chen, Zhong; Wen, Chengping; Xu, Zhenghao",bioRxiv,5,16

This study aimed to identify (1) the extent to which COVID-19 messaging by state public health departments is understandable, actionable, and clear; (2) whether materials produced by public health departments are easily readable; (3) relationships between material type and understandability, actionability, clarity, and reading grade level; and (4) potential strategies to improve public health messaging around COVID-19. METHODS: Based on US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics from June 30, 2020, we identified the ten states with the most COVID-19 cases and selected forty-two materials (i.e., webpages, infographics, and videos) related to COVID-19 prevention according to predefined eligibility criteria. We applied three validated health literacy tools (i.e., Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool, CDC Clear Communication Index, and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level) to assess material understandability, actionability, clarity, and readability. We also analyzed correlations between scores on the three health literacy tools and material types. RESULTS: Overall, COVID-19 materials had high understandability and actionability but could be improved in terms of clarity and readability. Material type was significantly correlated with understandability, actionability, and clarity. Infographics and videos received higher scores on all tools. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we recommend public health entities apply a combination of these tools when developing health information materials to improve their understandability, actionability, and clarity. We also recommend using infographics and videos when possible, taking a human-centered approach to information design, and providing multiple modes and platforms for information delivery.","Mani, Nandita S.; Ottosen, Terri; Fratta, Megan; Yu, Fei",Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA,5,17

Monitoring weight is a component of ascites care and telemonitoring may improve outcomes and costs. Goals We aimed to evaluate the cost and outcomes of current care compared to a telemonitoring system for ascites. Study We developed a decision-analytic model that examined 100 simulated patients over a 6-month horizon. We compared usual care to a new telemonitoring program, which we estimate costs $50,000/6 months. RESULTS: The cost of standard of care for 100 patients with cirrhotic ascites over a 6-month period is $167,500 more expensive than telemonitoring. By varying parameter probabilities by ± 10% and outcome costs by ± 20%, we found that standard of care remains more expensive than care with a telemonitoring intervention by $9400 to $340,200 per 6-month period. Standard of care leads to 9 more admissions (range 4 to 12) than a telemonitoring intervention, while telemonitoring leads to 9 more outpatient visits (range 6 to 9) and 28 additional outpatient large volume paracenteses (LVPs) (range 17 to 28). With more and less expensive telemonitoring interventions, standard of care remained more expensive. With 50% adherence to the intervention, standard of care was $89,848 more expensive. CONCLUSIONS: In almost all probability and cost scenarios, a telemonitoring intervention is cost-saving for the management of cirrhotic ascites. Using hospital admissions as a surrogate for quality of care, patient outcomes are improved primarily though more proactive medical intervention and more LVPs.

METHODS: 50 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively compared to 50 patients with AH1N1 pneumonia diagnosed during the 2009 pandemic. Two radiologists reviewed chest CT scans independently and blindly, with discordance resolved by consensus. Dilated or tortuous vessels within hyperdense lesions were recorded. RESULTS: COVID-19 pneumonia presented with bilateral (96%), peripheral areas of GGO (22%), consolidation (4%) or combined GGO-consolidation (74%). The vascular enlargement sign in COVID-19 pneumonia was much more commonly present in COVID-19 (45/50, 90%) versus AH1N1 pneumonia (12/50, 24%) (p < 0.001). Vascular enlargement was more often present in lower lobes with a peripheral distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular enlargement in consolidative/GGO areas may represent a reasonably common early CT marker in COVID-19 patients and is of uncertain etiology. Although speculative, theoretical mechanisms could potentially reflect acute inflammatory changes, pulmonary endothelial activation, or acute stasis. Further studies are necessary to verify specificity and to study if prognostic for clinical outcomes.","Bianco, Andrea; Valente, Tullio; Perrotta, Fabio; Stellato, Elvira; Brunese, Luca; Wood, Brad J.; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo; Parrella, Roberto",Heliyon,5,20

We selected Yersiniabactin receptor of Escherichia coli UMN026 and Flagellin of Stenotrophomonas maltophila. B-cell linear epitopes were predicted using Bepipred prediction tool. Peptide binding with reference sets of 27 alleles of MHC class I and class II was also analyzed. The predicted peptides-MHC complexes were further validated using simulation dynamics. The in-silico construction of chimera was done by restriction mapping and codon optimization. Chimera was evaluated using the immunoinformatic approach as done for the selected proteins. From the 673 amino acids of FyuA protein, a region from 1 to 492 was selected for containing more linear epitopes and the processing scores obtained were significant for MHC class I and class II binding. Similarly, from Flagellin, a region between 60 and 328 amino acids was selected and the peptides present in the selected region showed lower percentile ranks for binding with MHC molecules. The simulation studies validated the predictions of peptide-MHC complexes. The selected gene fragments accommodating maximum part of these peptides were used to design a chimaeric construct of 2454 bp. From the immunoinformatic analysis, the chimera was found to be more immunogenic in terms of increased number of B-cell and T-cell epitopes along with increased coverage of global populations with allelic variability.","Kumar, Ashutosh; Harjai, Kusum; Chhibber, Sanjay",Hum Immunol,5,20

Methods: Lung ultrasound was performed to 63 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to a University Hospital. Lung involvement was evaluated using a 4-point scale with a 12-area pulmonary division (lung score -LS-). Ultrasound findings, along with clinical characteristics, were recorded. Results: All patients showed ultrasound involvement in at least 1 area (mean 8 {+/-} 3.5). Total LS was 15.3 {+/-} 8.1, without differences between left and right lung. Most affected regions were the lower one (95.2%) and the posterior one (73.8%). Total LS showed a strong correlation (r = -0.765) with PaO2/FiO2; by lung regions, those with a higher correlation were the LS of the anterior one (r = -0.823) and the LS of the upper one (r = -0.731). 22.2% of patients required non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS). Multivariate analysis shows that anterior region LS, adjusted for age and sex, is significant (odds ratio 2.159, 95% confidence interval 1.309 to 3.561) for the risk of requiring NIRS. Anterior region LS [≥] 4 and total LS [≥] 19 have similar characteristics to predict the need for NIRS. Conclusions: Ultrasound involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia is bilateral and heterogeneous. Most affected regions are the posterior and the lower ones. The anterior region has prognostic value, because its involvement strongly correlates with the risk of requiring NIRS, and an anterior region LS [≥] 4 has high sensitivity and specificity for predicting the need for NIRS.","Castelao, J.; Graziani, D.; Collaborative Working Group COVID Pulmonology Guadalajara,; Soriano, J.

CONCLUSIONS: Subject to regional demands, CAT can be considered as the relatively safer modality-predictable and effective apposite to fixed orthodontic appliances in these unprecedented times.","Kaur, Harneet; Kochhar, Anuraj Singh; Gupta, Harshita; Singh, Gurkeerat; Kubavat, Ajay",J Oral Biol Craniofac Res,5,32

We aimed to address the current uncertainties regarding incident thyroid dysfunction and autoimmunity among COVID-19 survivors. METHODS: We included consecutive adult COVID-19 patients without known thyroid disorders, who were admitted to Queen Mary Hospital from July 21 to September 21, 2020 and had serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine (fT3), and anti-thyroid antibodies measured both on admission and at 3 months. RESULTS: In total, 122 patients were included. Among 20 patients with abnormal thyroid function tests (TFTs) on admission (mostly low fT3), 15 recovered. Among 102 patients with initial normal TFTs, two had new-onset abnormalities that could represent different phases of thyroiditis. Among 104 patients whose anti-thyroid antibody titers were reassessed, we observed increases in anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) (P<0.001) and anti-thyroglobulin (P<0.001), but not anti-thyroid stimulating hormone receptor titers (P=0.486). Of 82 patients with negative anti-TPO findings at baseline, 16 had a significant interval increase in anti-TPO titer by >12 U, and four became anti-TPO-positive. Worse baseline clinical severity (P=0.018), elevated C-reactive protein during hospitalization (P=0.033), and higher baseline anti-TPO titer (P=0.005) were associated with a significant increase in anti-TPO titer. CONCLUSION: Most patients with thyroid dysfunction on admission recovered during convalescence. Abnormal TFTs suggestive of thyroiditis occurred during convalescence, but infrequently. Importantly, our novel observation of an increase in anti-thyroid antibody titers post-COVID-19 warrants further follow-up for incident thyroid dysfunction among COVID-19 survivors.","Lui, David Tak Wai; Lee, Chi Ho; Chow, Wing Sun; Lee, Alan Chun Hong; Tam, Anthony Raymond; Fong, Carol Ho Yi; Law, Chun Yiu; Leung, Eunice Ka Hong; To, Kelvin Kai Wang; Tan, Kathryn Choon Beng; Woo, Yu Cho; Lam, Ching Wan; Hung, Ivan Fan Ngai; Lam, Karen Siu Ling",Endocrinol Metab (Seoul),5,21

METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data were retrieved in a cohort of 146 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Potential risk factors for the development of severe COVID-19 were evaluated. RESULTS: On admission, lymphocytes, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, eosinophils, and albumin and pre-albumin were dramatically lower, whereas neutrophils, and interleukin (IL)-10, C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) were significantly higher in severe cases. By the second week after discharge, all variables improved to normal levels. Covariate logistic regression results showed that the CD8+ cell count and CRP level were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Lower peripheral immune cell subsets in patients with severe disease recovered to normal levels as early as the second week after discharge.

For researchers responding to femicide, family and intimate partner homicide, there are substantial challenges around accessing robust data that is complete and fully representative of the experiences and social identities of those affected. This raises questions of how certain social identities are privileged and how the lens of intersectionality may be constrained or enabled through research. Further, there is limited insight into the emotional labour and safety for researchers, and how they experience and mitigate vicarious trauma. We examine these issues through a shared critical reflection and conclude with key recommendations to address the challenges and issues identified. Four researchers examining and responding to femicide, family and intimate partner homicide in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom shared and evaluated their critical reflection. We drew on our experiences and offer insights into processes, impacts and unintended consequences of fatality reviews and research initiatives. There are substantial limitations in accessibility and completeness of data, which has unintended consequences for the construction of social identities of those affected, including how multiple forms of exclusion and structural oppression are represented. Our experiences as researchers are complex and have driven us to implement strategies to mitigate vicarious trauma. We assert that these issues can be addressed by reconceptualizing the goals of data collection and fostering collaborative discussions among those involved in data collection and violence prevention to strengthen research, prevention efforts and safety for all involved.","Cullen, Patricia; Dawson, Myrna; Price, Jenna; Rowlands, James",J Fam Violence,5,20

Benchmarking based on the increase in total cases or case fatality rates is one way of comparing the evolution of the pandemic across countries or territories and could inform policy decisions about strategies to control coronavirus transmission. However, comparing cases and fatality rates across regions is challenging due to heterogeneity in testing and health systems. We show two complementary ways of benchmarking across territories and in time. First, we used multivariate regressions to estimate the test-elasticity of Covid-19 case incidence. Cases grow less than proportionally with testing when assessing weekly changes or looking across states in the USA. They tend to be proportional or even more than proportional when comparing the month-to-month evolution of an average country in the pandemic. Our results were robust to various model specifications. Second, we decomposed the growth in cases into test growth and positive test ratio growth to intuitively visualize the components of case growth. We hope these results can help support evidence-based decisions by public officials and help the public discussion when comparing across territories and in time.","Asahi, Kenzo; Undurraga, Eduardo A.; Wagner, Rodrigo",Sci Rep,5,16

Neutrophils isolated from the blood of adults with ARDS have elevated expression of interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISGs) associated with decreased capacity of neutrophils to kill Staphylococcus aureus and worse clinical outcomes. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are elevated in adults with ARDS. Whether pediatric ARDS (PARDS) is similarly associated with altered neutrophil expression of ISGs and neutrophil extracellular trap release is not known. Tracheal aspirate fluid and cells were collected within 72 h from seventy-seven intubated children. Primary airway neutrophils were analyzed for differential ISG expression by PCR, STAT1 phosphorylation and markers of degranulation and activation by flow cytometry. Airway fluid was analyzed for the release of NETs by myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes using an ELISA. Higher STAT1 phosphorylation, markers of neutrophil degranulation, activation and NET release were found in children with versus without PARDS. Higher NETs were detected in the airways of children with ventilator-free days less than 20 days. Increased airway cell IFN signaling, neutrophil activation, and NET production is associated with PARDS. Higher levels of airway NETs are associated with fewer ventilator-free days.","Grunwell, Jocelyn R.; Stephenson, Susan T.; Mohammad, Ahmad F.; Jones, Kaitlin; Mason, Carrie; Opolka, Cydney; Fitzpatrick, Anne M.",Sci Rep,5,1

In this study, an integrated risk assessment is presented for SARS-CoV-2 close proximity exposure between a speaking infectious subject and a susceptible subject. It is based on a three-dimensional transient numerical model for the description of exhaled droplet spread once emitted by a speaking person, coupled with a recently proposed SARS-CoV-2 emission approach. Particle image velocimetry measurements were conducted to validate the numerical model. The contribution of the large droplets to the risk is barely noticeable only for distances well below 0.6 m, whereas it drops to zero for greater distances where it depends only on airborne droplets. In particular, for short exposures (10 s) a minimum safety distance of 0.75 m should be maintained to lower the risk below 0.1%; for exposures of 1 and 15 min this distance increases to about 1.1 and 1.5 m, respectively. Based on the interpersonal distances across countries reported as a function of interacting individuals, cultural differences, and environmental and sociopsychological factors, the approach presented here revealed that, in addition to intimate and personal distances, particular attention must be paid to exposures longer than 1 min within social distances (of about 1 m).","Cortellessa, G.; Stabile, L.; Arpino, F.; Faleiros, D.E.; van den Bos, W.; Morawska, L.; Buonanno, G.",Sci Total Environ,5,16

Hospital facilities are both complex and critical infrastructures, because they are characterized by high level of interconnections, dynamism, technological innovation, and because they offer health and social essential services. Decision-makers have to implement modernization strategies of hospital facilities in order to guarantee a high standard of care and a resilient response during disasters and emergencies. The critical role played by hospital facilities is acknowledge by the international action programs, including the 2030 Agenda of United Nations for Sustainable Development, and it has been emphasized by the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper illustrates the RADAR-Hospital Facilities methodology (RADAR-HF) developed for the situational assessment of the physical environment of hospital facilities. RADAR-HF provides the decision-makers with an overview of the main aspects for modernization (safety, functionality, sustainability, adaptability, comfort) and substantial information for planning interventions, considering hospital facilities as interconnected systems. The outcomes are represented by ad-hoc designed graphical indicators and overview-tools, that summarize the status-conditions of one or a set of existing hospital facilities, the upgrading needs, and the best occupancy of facilities. Decision-makers could use RADAR-HF to define integrated modernization strategies with resilience improvement, monitor the situation of the facilities, and understand the effectiveness of interventions. The paper ends showing the results obtained in a research project, in which RADAR-HF has been applied to assess the existing hospital facilities of the Friuli Venezia Giulia region (North-East of Italy).","Grimaz, Stefano; Ruzzene, Elisabetta; Zorzini, Fabio",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,5,16

However, the extent to which stress associates with food choice motives is not completely understood. This study assessed whether emotional eating mediates the associations between perceived stress levels and food choice motives (i.e., health, mood, convenience, natural content, price, sensory appeal, familiarities, weight control, and ethical concerns) during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. A total of 800 respondents were surveyed in the United States in June 2020. Their perceived stress, emotional eating, and food choice motives were assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale, Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and Food Choice Questionnaire, respectively. Moderate to high levels of perceived stress were experienced by the majority (73.6%) of respondents. Perceived stress was significantly correlated with emotional eating (r = 0.26) as well as five out of nine food choice motives: mood (r = 0.32), convenience (r = 0.28), natural content (r = −0.14), price (r = 0.27), and familiarity (r = 0.15). Emotional eating was significantly correlated with four out of nine food choice motives: mood (r = 0.27), convenience (r = 0.23), price (r = 0.16), and familiarity (r = 0.16). The mediation analyses showed that emotional eating mediates the associations between perceived stress and five food choices motives: mood, convenience, sensory appeal, price, and familiarity.

METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a retrospective observational study of all patients admitted with COVID-19 to Huo Shen Shan Hospital. The hospital was dedicated solely to the treatment of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Hypertension and the treatments were stratified according to the medical history or medications administrated prior to the infection. Among 2877 hospitalized patients, 29.5% (850/2877) had a history of hypertension. After adjustment for confounders, patients with hypertension had a two-fold increase in the relative risk of mortality as compared with patients without hypertension [4.0% vs. 1.1%, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17–3.82, P = 0.013]. Patients with a history of hypertension but without antihypertensive treatment (n = 140) were associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality compared with those with antihypertensive treatments (n = 730) (7.9% vs. 3.2%, adjusted HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.03–4.57, P = 0.041). The mortality rates were similar between the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor (4/183) and non-RAAS inhibitor (19/527) cohorts (2.2% vs. 3.6%, adjusted HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.28–2.58, P = 0.774). However, in a study-level meta-analysis of four studies, the result showed that patients with RAAS inhibitor use tend to have a lower risk of mortality (relative risk 0.65, 95% CI 0.45–0.94, P = 0.20). CONCLUSION: While hypertension and the discontinuation of antihypertensive treatment are suspected to be related to increased risk of mortality, in this retrospective observational analysis, we did not detect any harm of RAAS inhibitors in patients infected with COVID-19. However, the results should be considered as exploratory and interpreted cautiously.","Gao, Chao; Cai, Yue; Zhang, Kan; Zhou, Lei; Zhang, Yao; Zhang, Xijing; Li, Qi; Li, Weiqin; Yang, Shiming; Zhao, Xiaoyan; Zhao, Yuying; Wang, Hui; Liu, Yi; Yin, Zhiyong; Zhang, Ruining; Wang, Rutao; Yang, Ming; Hui, Chen; Wijns, William; McEvoy, J William; Soliman, Osama; Onuma, Yoshinobu; Serruys, Patrick W; Tao, Ling; Li, Fei",Eur Heart J,5,8

The Training Committee of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition sought to understand how COVID-19 has affected pediatric gastroenterology fellowship training. METHODS: A 21 question survey was distributed to all 77 pediatric gastroenterology fellowship program directors (PDs) in the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition program director database via email on April 7. Responses collected through April 19, 2020 were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Fifty-one of 77 (66%) PDs from the United States, Canada, and Mexico responded to the survey. Forty-six of 51 (90%) PDs reported that they were under a “stay-at-home” order for a median of 4 weeks at the time of the survey. Two of the 51 (4%) programs had fellows participating in outpatient telehealth before COVID-19 and 39 of 51 (76%) at the time of the survey. Fellows stopped participating in outpatient clinics in 22 of 51 (43%) programs and endoscopy in 26 of 51 (52%) programs. Changes to inpatient care included reduced fellow staffing, limiting who entered patient rooms, and rounding remotely. Fellows in 3 New York programs were deployed to adult medicine units. Didactics were moved to virtual conferences in 47 of 51 (94%) programs, and fellows used various online resources. Clinical research and, disproportionately, bench research were restricted.

Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of what is known of each protein’s functions, highlighting important differences between them. While there is extensive information about A1 and A2/B1, we found that even the basic functions of the A0 and A3 proteins have not been well-studied. We also noted that the regulation and tissue distribution of all four of the proteins and their different isoforms require further study. Finally, since these proteins together play such a central role in regulating the cell’s RNA, we call for careful comparative examination of these proteins to better define the precise boundaries of each protein’s role in cell function and disease. ABSTRACT: The hnRNP A/B family of proteins is canonically central to cellular RNA metabolism, but due to their highly conserved nature, the functional differences between hnRNP A1, A2/B1, A0, and A3 are often overlooked. In this review, we explore and identify the shared and disparate homeostatic and disease-related functions of the hnRNP A/B family proteins, highlighting areas where the proteins have not been clearly differentiated. Herein, we provide a comprehensive assembly of the literature on these proteins. We find that there are critical gaps in our grasp of A/B proteins’ alternative splice isoforms, structures, regulation, and tissue and cell-type-specific functions, and propose that future mechanistic research integrating multiple A/B proteins will significantly improve our understanding of how this essential protein family contributes to cell homeostasis and disease.","Thibault, Patricia A.; Ganesan, Aravindhan; Kalyaanamoorthy, Subha; Clarke, Joseph-Patrick W.

Proteases, the hydrolases, can be of several types based on the nucleophilic amino acid or the metal cofactor needed for their activity. Cathepsins are proteases with serine, cysteine, or aspartic acid residues as the nucleophiles, which are vital for digestion, coagulation, immune response, adipogenesis, hormone liberation, peptide synthesis, among a litany of other functions. But inflammatory state radically affects their normal roles. Released from the lysosomes, they degrade extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen and elastin, mediating parasite infection, autoimmune diseases, tumor metastasis, cardiovascular issues, and neural degeneration, among other health hazards. Over the years, the different types and isoforms of cathepsin, their optimal pH and functions have been studied, yet much information is still elusive. By taming and harnessing cathepsins, by inhibitors and judicious lifestyle, a gamut of malignancies can be resolved. This review discusses these aspects, which can be of clinical relevance.","Patel, Seema; Homaei, Ahmad; El-Seedi, Hesham R.; Akhtar, Nadeem",Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy,5,28

In the meantime, the US has recorded consecutive years of above-norm temperature since 1997 and precipitation surplus since 2008. The present study analyzed the legionellosis incidence in the US during the 20-year period of 1999 to 2018 and correlated with concurrent temperature, precipitation, solar ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, and vehicle mileage data. The age-adjusted legionellosis incidence rates rose exponentially from 0.40/100,000 in 1999 (with 1108 cases) to 2.69/100,000 in 2018 (with 9933 cases) at a calculated annual increase of 110%. In regression analyses, the rise correlated with an increase in vehicle miles driven and with temperature and precipitation levels that have been above the 1901–2000 mean since 1997 and 2008, respectively, suggesting more road exposure to traffic-generated aerosols and promotive effects of anomalous climate.

An interactive synergy between annual precipitation and vehicle miles was also found in multiple regressions. Meanwhile, the bactericidal UVB radiation has been decreasing, which also contributed to the rising incidence in an inverse correlation. The 2018 legionellosis incidence peak corresponded to cumulative effects of the climate anomalies, vast vehicle miles (3,240 billion miles, 15904 km per capita), record high precipitation (880.1 mm), near record low UVB radiation (7488 kJ/m(2)), and continued above-norm temperature (11.96°C). These effects were examined and demonstrated in California, Florida, New Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin, states that represent diverse incidence rates and climates. The incidence and above-norm temperature both rose most in cold Wisconsin. These results suggest that warming temperature and precipitation surplus have likely elevated the density of Legionella bacteria in the environment, and together with road exposure explain the rapidly rising incidence of legionellosis in the United States. These trends are expected to continue, warranting further research and efforts to prevent infection.","Han, Xiang Y.",PLoS One,5,26

Narratives describing recovery from health problems are a focus of research, including those presented in recorded (eg, invariant) form. No clinical trial has been conducted on a web-based intervention providing access to a collection of Recorded Recovery Narratives (RRNs). OBJECTIVE: This study presents knowledge produced through the development of the Narrative Experiences Online (NEON) Intervention, a web-based intervention incorporating the algorithmic recommendation of RRNs. METHODS: Knowledge was gathered through knowledge integration (KI) activities. KI1 synthesized previous studies to produce the NEON Impact Model describing how accessing RRNs produces health-related outcomes. KI2 developed curation principles for the NEON Collection of RRNs through consultation with the NEON Lived Experience Advisory Panel and the curation of a preliminary collection. KI3 identified harm minimization strategies for the NEON Intervention through consultation with the NEON International Advisory Board and Lived Experience Advisory Panel. The NEON Intervention was finalized through 2 research studies (RS). In RS1, mental health service users (N=40) rated the immediate impact of randomly presented narratives to validate narrative feedback questions used to inform the recommendation algorithm. In RS2, mental health service users (n=25) were interviewed about their immediate response to a prototype of the NEON Intervention and trial procedures and then were interviewed again after 1 month of use. The usability and acceptability of the prototype and trial procedures were evaluated and refinements were made. RESULTS: KI1 produced the NEON Impact Model, which identifies moderators (recipient and context), mechanisms of connection (reflection, comparison, learning, and empathy), processes (identification of change from narrative structure or content and internalization of observed change), and outcomes (helpful and unhelpful). KI2 identified 22 curation principles, including a mission to build a large, heterogeneous collection to maximize opportunities for connection. KI3 identified seven harm minimization strategies, including content warnings, proactive and reactive blocking of narratives, and providing resources for the self-management of emotional distress. RS1 found variation in the impact of narratives on different participants, indicating that participant-level feedback on individual narratives is needed to inform a recommender system. The order of presentation did not predict narrative feedback. RS2 identified amendments to web-based trial procedures and the NEON Intervention. Participants accessed some narratives multiple times, use reduced over the 4-week period, and narrative feedback was provided for 31.8% (105/330) of narrative accesses. CONCLUSIONS: RRNs can be integrated into web-based interventions. Evaluating the NEON Intervention in a clinical trial is feasible. The mixed methods design for developing the NEON Intervention can guide its extension to other clinical populations, the design of other web-based mental health interventions, and the development of narrative-based interventions in mental health.","Slade, Mike; Rennick-Egglestone, Stefan; Llewellyn-Beardsley, Joy; Yeo, Caroline; Roe, James; Bailey, Sylvia; Smith, Roger Andrew; Booth, Susie; Harrison, Julian; Bhogal, Adaresh; Penas Morán, Patricia; Hui, Ada; Quadri, Dania; Robinson, Clare; Smuk, Melanie; Farkas, Marianne; Davidson, Larry; van der Krieke, Lian; Slade, Emily; Bond, Carmel; Nicholson, Joe; Grundy, Andrew; Charles, Ashleigh; Hare-Duke, Laurie; Pollock, Kristian; Ng, Fiona",JMIR Form Res,5,16

In the first experiment sheep and cattle were inoculated with T. lestoquardi sporozoites. Surviving animals and naive sheep and cattle were, in the second experiment, inoculated with T. annulata. In the third experiment, naive sheep and sheep previously infected with T. annulata, were inoculated with T. lestoquardi. The following responses to inoculations were monitored: clinical and haematological signs of infection, appearance of parasitic stages of the parasites in lymph node biopsies and in peripheral blood and serological response to T. lestoquardi and T. annulata schizont antigens. While T. lestoquardi readily infected sheep and caused severe disease, it did not infect cattle. On the other hand, T. annulata infected both cattle and sheep. However, whereas cattle became severely affected, infected sheep showed mild clinical symptoms only and piroplasms did not develop. Despite their different behaviour in the host species examined, cross-immunity studies suggested that the parasite species are very closely related. Experiments in sheep indicated that T. lestoquardi infection protected against subsequent T. annulata infection. On the other hand, recovery from T. annulata infection did not prevent infection by sporozoites of T. lestoquardi, resulting in the establishment of schizonts and their subsequent development into piroplasms, although it protected against the major clinical effects of T. lestoquardi infection.","Leemans, Ingrid; Brown, Duncan; Hooshmand-Rad, Parviz; Kirvar, Erol; Uggla, Arvid",Vet Parasitol,5,16

Elevated biomarkers of coagulation (fibrinogen and D-dimer) and inflammation (c-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin) are associated with poor outcome in SARS-CoV-2. Whether the time-course of fibrinogen, D-dimer, CRP and ferritin is associated with the occurrence of pulmonary thromboembolism in SARS-CoV-2 patients is unknown. We hypothesise that patients on mechanical ventilation with SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical pulmonary thromboembolism have lower concentrations of fibrinogen and higher D-dimer, CRP, and ferritin concentrations over time compared to patients without a clinical pulmonary thromboembolism. METHODS: In a prospective study, fibrinogen, D-dimer, CRP and ferritin were measured daily. Clinical suspected pulmonary thromboembolism was either confirmed or excluded based on computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or by transthoracic ultrasound (TTU) (i.e., right-sided cardiac thrombus). In addition, patients who received therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator were included when clinical instability in suspected pulmonary thromboembolism did not allow CTPA. Serial data were analysed using a mixed-effects linear regression model, and models were adjusted for known risk factors (age, sex, APACHE-II score, body mass index), biomarkers of coagulation and inflammation, and anticoagulants. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were considered to suffer from pulmonary thromboembolism ((positive CTPA (n = 27), TTU positive (n = 1), therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (n = 3)), and eight patients with negative CTPA were included. After adjustment for known risk factors and anticoagulants, patients with, compared to those without, clinical pulmonary thromboembolism had lower average fibrinogen concentration of − 0.9 g/L (95% CI: − 1.6 – − 0.1) and lower average ferritin concentration of − 1045 μg/L (95% CI: − 1983 – − 106) over time. D-dimer and CRP average concentration did not significantly differ, 561 μg/L (− 6212–7334) and 27 mg/L (− 32–86) respectively. Ferritin lost statistical significance, both in sensitivity analysis and after adjustment for fibrinogen and D-dimer. CONCLUSION: Lower average concentrations of fibrinogen over time were associated with the presence of clinical pulmonary thromboembolism in patients at the Intensive Care, whereas D-dimer, CRP and ferritin were not. Lower concentrations over time may indicate the consumption of fibrinogen related to thrombus formation in the pulmonary vessels.

This study sought to investigate the relationship between findings on echocardiography, mortality and race in COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study including 164 adults (61±13years; 78% male; 36% BAME) hospitalized with COVID-19 undergoing echocardiography between March 16 and May 9, 2020 at 3 days (IQR 2 – 5) from admission. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. RESULTS: After a median follow up of 31 days (IQR 14 – 42 days), 58 (35%) patients had died. The right ventricle (RV) was dilated in 62 (38%) patients, and 58 (35%) patients had RV systolic dysfunction. Only 2 (1%) patients had left ventricular (LV) dilatation and 133 (81%) had normal or hyperdynamic LV systolic function. Reduced tricuspid annulus planar systolic excursion was associated with elevated D-dimer (ρ = −0.18, p = 0.025) and high-sensitivity cardiac Troponin (ρ = −0.30, p < 0.0001). Reduced RV systolic function (HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.05 – 3.09; p = 0.032) was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality after adjustment for demographic and clinical risk factors. Comparing white and BAME individuals, there were no differences in echocardiography findings, biomarkers or mortality.

By way of using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technique, bladder cell clustering and ACE2 expression in various cell types were measured respectively. ResultIn pubic database (healthy human and mice bladder), ACE2 expression in humans and mice is concentrated in bladder epithelial cells. The disappearance of umbrella cells, a component of bladder epithelial, was found in our OAB model.

The present study adapted the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) to the Spanish population, and 1094 Spanish adults (mean age 52.55 years, 241 males) completed the Spanish version in a cross-sectional online survey. To analyze the factorial structure and reliability of the CPDI, we performed an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) followed by a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the Spanish sample. The effects of gender and age on the degree of distress were analyzed using the factorial scores of the CPDI as the dependent variables. Results showed that, after rotation, the first factor (Stress symptoms) accounted for 35% of the total variance and the second factor (COVID-19 information) for 15%. Around 25% (n = 279) of the participants experienced mild to moderate distress symptoms, 16% (n = 179) severe distress, and about 58% (n = 636) showed no distress symptoms. Women experienced more distress than men ([Formula: see text]), and distress decreased with age ([Formula: see text]).

This number, however, generally differs substantially from the number of confirmed cases due to a large fraction of asymptomatic infections as well as geographically and temporally variable testing effort and strategies. Here I use age-stratified death count statistics, published age-dependent infection fatality risks and stochastic modeling to estimate the true prevalence and growth of COVID-19 infections among adults (age >=20 years) in 161 countries, from early 2020 until November 1, 2020.

Study design Cross sectional analyses of UKHLS COVID-19 wave data collected in April 2020. Methods UKHLS participants completed a COVID-19 questionnaire in April 2020. 635 children who were FSM eligible with complete data were included in the analytic sample. Accessing a FSM was defined as having receiving a FSM voucher or a cooked meal at school. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate (i) associations between characteristics and access to FSM and (ii) associations between access to FSM and household food insecurity measures. All analyses accounted for survey design and sample weights. Results 51% of eligible children accessed a FSM. Children in junior schools or above (aged 8+ years) (OR 11.81; 95% CI 5.54,25.19), who were low income (AOR 4.81; 95% CI 2.10,11.03) or still attending schools (AOR 5.87; 95% CI 1.70,20.25) were more likely to receive FSM. Children in Wales were less likely to access FSM than those in England (AOR 0.11; 95% CI 0.03,0.43). Receiving a FSM was associated with an increased odds of recently using a food bank, but not reporting feeling hungry. Conclusions In the month following the COVID-19 lockdown, 49% of eligible children did not receive any form of FSM. The present analyses highlight that the voucher scheme did not adequately serve children who could not attend school during the lockdown. Moreover, more needs to be done to support families relying on income-related benefits, who still report needed to access a foodbank.

The objective was to derive and validate a clinical prediction score for SARS-CoV-2 infection that uses simple criteria widely available at the point of care. METHODS: Data came from the registry data from the national REgistry of suspected COVID-19 in EmeRgency care (RECOVER network) comprising 116 hospitals from 25 states in the US. Clinical variables and 30-day outcomes were abstracted from medical records of 19,850 emergency department (ED) patients tested for SARS-CoV-2. The criterion standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 required a positive molecular test from a swabbed sample or positive antibody testing within 30 days. The prediction score was derived from a 50% random sample (n = 9,925) using unadjusted analysis of 107 candidate variables as a screening step, followed by stepwise forward logistic regression on 72 variables. RESULTS: Multivariable regression yielded a 13-variable score, which was simplified to a 13-point score: +1 point each for age>50 years, measured temperature>37.5°C, oxygen saturation<95%, Black race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, household contact with known or suspected COVID-19, patient reported history of dry cough, anosmia/dysgeusia, myalgias or fever; and -1 point each for White race, no direct contact with infected person, or smoking. In the validation sample (n = 9,975), the probability from logistic regression score produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.79–0.81), and this level of accuracy was retained across patients enrolled from the early spring to summer of 2020. In the simplified score, a score of zero produced a sensitivity of 95.6% (94.8–96.3%), specificity of 20.0% (19.0–21.0%), negative likelihood ratio of 0.22 (0.19–0.26). Increasing points on the simplified score predicted higher probability of infection (e.g., >75% probability with +5 or more points). CONCLUSION: Criteria that are available at the point of care can accurately predict the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These criteria could assist with decisions about isolation and testing at high throughput checkpoints.","Kline, Jeffrey A.; Camargo, Carlos A.; Courtney, D.

Even during a pandemic, research still requires a legal basis for the processing of sensitive data, additional justification for its processing, and a basis for any transfer of data outside Europe. The GDPR does provide legal grounds and derogations that can support research addressing a pandemic, if the data processing activities are proportionate to the aim pursued and accompanied by suitable safeguards. During a pandemic, a public interest basis may be more promising for research than a consent basis, given the high standards set out in the GDPR. However, the GDPR leaves many aspects of the public interest basis to be determined by individual Member States, which have not fully or uniformly made use of all options. The consequence is an inconsistent legal patchwork that displays insufficient clarity and impedes joint approaches. The COVID-19 experience provides lessons for national legislatures.

Adults over the age of 70 in the UK were advised to self-isolate for 3 months early during the pandemic and it is unclear which factors influenced their experiences during this time. Objective: The aim of this qualitative study was to explore factors that threatened and protected the wellbeing of older adults living in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We undertook semi-structured interviews with 20 adults aged over 70. Purposive sampling methods were used to increase diversity within the group. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Participants were aged 72-93, 9 women and 11 men, 80% were White British, 40% lived alone. We identified 2 superordinate themes, including (1) Threats to wellbeing: mortality concerns, grief and loss of normal life, restricted health service access, COVID-19 concerns, and restricted access to activities that protect wellbeing. (2) Factors protective of wellbeing: slower pace of life, maintaining routine, socialising, and use of past coping skills. Many participants drew on their resilience and life experience to self-manage fear and uncertainty associated with the pandemic, using their time during lockdown to reflect or organise end-of-life affairs. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that while older adults experienced challenges, many were resilient against COVID-19 restrictions despite early concerns of mental health consequences.

Using National Health Insurance Service data, this study created a cohort of 21,050 newly hired nurses across 304 hospitals in 2018, with a follow-up period of 18 months. Retention and turnover risk factors were analyzed at 6-month intervals. Differences in retention period according to hospitals’ organizational characteristics and nurses’ individual characteristics were analyzed using the chi-squared test. The likelihood of staying at work was analyzed using Kaplan–Meier survival curves with the log-rank test, and the hazard ratios of turnover at each retention period were analyzed using multilevel Cox proportional hazards analysis. The turnover rate of newly hired nurses within 1 year of employment was 26.4%, with 20.1% resigning within 6 months, and 6.3% resigning between 7 and 12 months. For all retention periods, turnover risk was associated with a higher bed-to-nurse ratio and older age. Higher standardized monthly income was associated with lower turnover between 13 and 18 months. Hospitals should develop nurse-retention strategies that consider risk factors for turnover. To reduce turnover, adequate nursing personnel should be maintained and fair compensation should be offered.","Kim, Yunmi; Kim, Hyun-Young",Int J Environ Res Public Health,5,1

We sought to quantify changes in Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA) utilization among different countries during the pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional time series analysis between 1 September 2018 and 31 August 2020, using the IQVIA MIDAS database, which contains DAA purchase data for 54 countries. We examined the percent change in DAA units dispensed (e.g., pills and capsules) from March to August 2019 to the same period of time in 2020 across the 54 countries. Interrupted time-series analysis was used to examine the impact of COVID-19 on monthly rates of DAA utilization across each of the major developed economies (G7 nations). Overall, 46 of 54 (85%) jurisdictions experienced a decline in DAA utilization during the pandemic, with an average of −43% (range: −1% in Finland to −93% in Brazil). All high HCV prevalence (HCV prevalence > 2%) countries in the database experienced a decline in utilization, average −49% (range: −17% in Kazakhstan to −90% in Egypt). Across the G7 nations, we also observed a decreased trend in DAA utilization during the early months of the pandemic, with significant declines (p < 0.01) for Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. The global response to COVID-19 led to a large decrease in DAA utilization globally.

To our knowledge there is no literature on telephonic follow up in pediatric patients with positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on rhino-pharyngeal swab after discharge. The aim of the study is to describe our experience in a telephonic follow up which can allow early and safe discharge from hospital while keeping the patients under close clinical monitoring. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-five children were admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection at Bambino Gesù Pediatric Hospital COVID Center from 16th March to 3rd July. We monitored through a telephonic follow-up, using a specific survey, the patients discharged still presenting a positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2. We checked if any symptoms occurred at home until recovery, defined as two consecutive negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on rhino-pharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: During the follow up 7 patients had mild and self-limited symptoms related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, while 2 patients were re-hospitalized. One patient had Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), the other patient had an increase in troponin and D-dimers. We also monitored the average time of viral shedding, resulting in a median duration of 28 days. CONCLUSION: Our experience describes the daily telephonic follow up as safe in pediatric patients discharged with positive PCR. As a matter of fact it could avoid long term hospitalization and allow to promptly re-hospitalize children with major complications such as MIS-C.","Clemente, Vitangelo; Tripiciano, Costanza; Moras, Patrizio; Deriu, Daniele; Di Giuseppe, Martina; Piscitelli, Anna Lucia; Cammerata, Michela; De Ioris, Maria Antonietta; Calò Carducci, Francesca Ippolita; Bernardi, Stefania; Campana, Andrea; D’Argenio, Patrizia; Rossi, Paolo",Ital J Pediatr,5,1

SARS-CoV emerged in 2002 to 2003 and led to a global outbreak of SARS. As with the outcome of human infection, intranasal infection of C57BL/6J mice with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV results in high-titer virus replication within the lung, induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and immune cell infiltration within the lung. Using this model, we investigated the role of the complement system during SARS-CoV infection. We observed activation of the complement cascade in the lung as early as day 1 following SARS-CoV infection. To test whether this activation contributed to protective or pathologic outcomes, we utilized mice deficient in C3 (C3(–/–)), the central component of the complement system. Relative to C57BL/6J control mice, SARS-CoV-infected C3(–/–) mice exhibited significantly less weight loss and less respiratory dysfunction despite equivalent viral loads in the lung. Significantly fewer neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes were present in the lungs of C3(–/–) mice than in C56BL/6J controls, and subsequent studies revealed reduced lung pathology and lower cytokine and chemokine levels in both the lungs and the sera of C3(–/–) mice than in controls. These studies identify the complement system as an important host mediator of SARS-CoV-induced disease and suggest that complement activation regulates a systemic proinflammatory response to SARS-CoV infection. Furthermore, these data suggest that SARS-CoV-mediated disease is largely immune driven and that inhibiting complement signaling after SARS-CoV infection might function as an effective immune therapeutic.","Gralinski, Lisa E.; Sheahan, Timothy P.; Morrison, Thomas E.; Menachery, Vineet D.; Jensen, Kara; Leist, Sarah R.; Whitmore, Alan; Heise, Mark T.; Baric, Ralph S.",mBio,5,10

The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on PwMS receiving DMTs that inhibit immune cell trafficking, such as natalizumab (NTZ) and fingolimod (FTY), remains to be determined, as do the possible effects of these drugs on both the infection and the related disease. AIMS: : To describe self-reported COVID-19 symptoms and disease severity in PwMS on NTZ or FTY who received serology confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: : From 27(th) April to 3(rd) May, 2020, telephone interviews were conducted with 140 PwMS under treatment with NTZ or FTY in order to collect structured data on multiple sclerosis (MS) and COVID-19. The patients, all followed at our center, were classified as symptomatic, paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic on the basis of their self-reported clinical characteristics. COVID-19 severity was rated on a 7-point ordinal scale. In addition, in the period 4(th) May to 3(rd) June 2020 SARS-CoV-2 serology testing, using the Roche SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Elecsys®), was performed in 104/140 (74.2%) of the interviewed PwMS (50 treated with NTZ and 54 with FTY). RESULTS: : 14/104 (13.4%) PwMS on NTZ or FTY had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: 8 met the criteria for asymptomatic, 3 for paucisymptomatic and 3 for symptomatic COVID-19 (COVID-19 severity score lower than 3). None of them required hospitalization or showed severe COVID-19 complications. CONCLUSIONS: : Despite the relatively high SARS CoV-2 seroprevalence found in this sample of PwMS, all the positive cases showed either no or only mild COVID-19 symptoms. These reassuring findings indicate a lack of COVID-19 complications in PwMS on DMTs and support the hypothesis that it is safe to maintain ongoing treatment with these drugs in the current setting.","Mallucci, Giulia; Zito, Antonio; Baldanti, Fausto; Gastaldi, Matteo; Fabbro, Beatrice Dal; Franciotta, Diego; Bergamaschi, Roberto",Mult Scler Relat Disord,5,16

We aimed to compare the mortality rates in COVID-19 patients who received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEIs/ARBs) and those who did not. In this retrospective cohort study, mortality was considered as the main outcome measure. All underlying diseases were assessed by the chronic use of medications related to each condition. We defined two main groups based on the ACEIs/ARBs administration. A logistic regression model was designed to define independent predictors of mortality as well as a Cox regression analysis. In total, 2553 patients were included in this study. The mortality frequency was higher in patients with a history of underlying diseases (22.4% vs 12.7%, P value < 0.001). The mortality rate in patients who received ACEIs/ARBs were higher than non-receivers (29.3% vs. 19.5%, P value = 0.013, OR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.1, 1.7) in the univariate analysis. However, the use of ACEIs/ARBs was a protective factor against mortality in the model when adjusted for underlying conditions, length of stay, age, gender, and ICU admission (P value < 0.001, OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.3, 0.7). The Kaplan–Meier curve showed an overall survival of approximately 85.7% after a 120-day follow-up. ACEIs/ARBs are protective factors against mortality in COVID-19 patients with HTN, and these agents can be considered potential therapeutic options in this disease.

Here we report simultaneous outbreaks of two distinct human respiratory viruses, human metapneumovirus (MPV; Pneumoviridae: Metapneumovirus) and human respirovirus 3 (HRV3; Paramyxoviridae; Respirovirus, formerly known as parainfluenza virus 3), in two chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) communities in the same forest in Uganda in December 2016 and January 2017. The viruses were absent before the outbreaks, but each was present in ill chimpanzees from one community during the outbreak period. Clinical signs and gross pathologic changes in affected chimpanzees closely mirrored symptoms and pathology commonly observed in humans for each virus. Epidemiologic modelling showed that MPV and HRV3 were similarly transmissible (R(0) of 1.27 and 1.48, respectively), but MPV caused 12.2% mortality mainly in infants and older chimpanzees, whereas HRV3 caused no direct mortality. These results are consistent with the higher virulence of MPV than HRV3 in humans, although both MPV and HRV3 cause a significant global disease burden. Both viruses clustered phylogenetically within groups of known human variants, with MPV closely related to a lethal 2009 variant from mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), suggesting two independent and simultaneous reverse zoonotic origins, either directly from humans or via intermediary hosts. These findings expand our knowledge of human origin viruses threatening wild chimpanzees and suggest that such viruses might be differentiated by their comparative epidemiological dynamics and pathogenicity in wild apes.

This population of older, frail Canadians continues to grow in size as do concurrent demands for community-based, outpatient and ambulatory models of care. Ideally, a multifaceted, proactive, planned and integrated care model includes ehealth. Although several factors are known to facilitate the implementation of ehealth in chronic disease management (CDM), for example, adequate support, usability, alignment of programme objectives, there is a growing body of inconclusive evidence on what is critical for implementation. We aim to achieve a fulsome understanding of factors critical to implementation by conducting a realist review—an approach suitable for understanding complex interventions. Our proposed review will identify factors critical to the implementation of ehealth in CDM (heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease and/or diabetes (type 1 or 2)) without limitations to care setting, language, publication year or geography. Findings will be presented in configurations of contexts, mechanisms and outcomes (CMOs). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A search strategy will be iteratively developed based on the concepts of ‘implementation’ and ‘adoption’ of ‘ehealth’ interventions used within ‘CDM’ to identify the peer-reviewed and grey literature published before 31 March 2021 from five databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL and PsychInfo) on ehealth interventions actively involving a healthcare provider for CDM among adults. Data extraction and synthesis will be guided by Realist and Meta-review Evidence Synthesis: Evolving Standards (RAMESES) guidelines informing core concepts of CMOs, and a study output will include a middle-range-theory describing the implementation of ehealth in CDM. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Findings will be published in an open-access peer-reviewed journal and presented at relevant conferences.

To help address the limited research on TS in the Marriage and family therapy (MFT) field, the present study seeks to describe the experiences of faculty telesupervisors who have provided TS as part of an online COAMFTE Accredited MFT master’s program since 2012 (telesupervision was provided before accreditation since 2005). Eighteen participants completed individual interviews or focus groups, which were analyzed using descriptive phenomenological procedures. Our results describe the essential structure of faculty supervisors’ experiences providing TS. Core themes include: general experiences with TS as a modality, online university-specific experiences with TS as a modality, a systemic lens is intentionally applied, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are intentionally addressed, and clinical competencies and ethics are intentionally addressed. A discussion of the essential experiences of faculty TS along with implications for clinical training and future research are reviewed.","Schmittel, Emily M.; Lettenberger-Klein, Cassandra; Oliver, Tracy; Butterfras, Rachel F.; Adamson, Darren W.",Contemp Fam Ther,5,1

Methods and results In this monocentric cohort retrospective study, we consecutively included all adult patients admitted to COVID 19 units between April 9 and May 29, 2020, and between February 1 and March 26, 2021. MetS was defined when at least three of the following components were met: android obesity, high HbA1c, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-cholesterol. COVID-19 deterioration was defined as the need for nasal oxygen flow ≥ 6 l/min within 28 days after admission. We included 155 patients (55.5% men, mean age 61.7 years old, mean body mass index 29.8 kg/m2). Fifty-six patients (36.1%) had COVID-19 deterioration. MetS was present in 126 patients (81.3%) and was associated with COVID-19 deterioration (no MetS vs MetS: 13.7% and 41.2%, respectively, p<0.01). Logistic regression taking into account MetS, age, gender, ethnicity, period of inclusion and Charlson Index showed that COVID-19 deterioration was 5.3 times more likely in MetS patients (95% confidence interval 1.3-20.2) than non-MetS patients. Conclusions Over 81.3% of patients hospitalized in COVID-19 units had MetS. This syndrome appears to be an independent risk factor of COVID-19 deterioration.","Ouedraogo, Elise; Allard, Lucie; Bihan, Hélène; Goupil de Bouille, Jeanne; Giroux-Leprieur, Bénédicte; Sutton, Angela; Baudry, Camille; Josse, Constant; Didier, Morgane; Deutsch, David; Rezgani, Imen; Bouchaud, Olivier; Cosson, Emmanuel",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,5,3

Here, we compare and discuss the diagnostic performance of a range of different molecular assays designed to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with suspected COVID-19. Using findings from a systematic review of 103 studies, we categorised COVID-19 molecular assays into 12 different test classes, covering point-of-care tests, various alternative RT-PCR protocols, and alternative methods such as isothermal amplification. We carried out meta-analyses to estimate the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of each test class. We also estimated the positive and negative predictive values of all diagnostic test classes across a range of prevalence rates. Using previously validated RT-PCR assays as a reference standard, 11 out of 12 classes showed a summary sensitivity estimate of at least 92% and a specificity estimate of at least 99%. Several diagnostic test classes were estimated to have positive predictive values of 100% throughout the investigated prevalence spectrum, whilst estimated negative predictive values were more variable and sensitive to disease prevalence. We also report the results of clinical utility models that can be used to determine the information gained from a positive and negative test result in each class, and whether each test is more suitable for confirmation or exclusion of disease. Our analysis suggests that several tests exist that are suitable alternatives to standard RT-PCR and we discuss scenarios in which these could be most beneficial, such as where time to test result is critical or, where resources are constrained. However, we also highlight methodological concerns with the design and conduct of many included studies, and also the existence of likely publication bias for some test classes. Our results should be interpreted with these shortcomings in mind. Furthermore, our conclusions on test performance are limited to their use in symptomatic populations: we did not identify sufficient suitable data to allow analysis of testing in asymptomatic populations.","Mironas, A.; Jarrom, D.; Campbell, E.; Washington, J.; Ettinger, S.; Wilbacher, I.; Endel, G.; Vrazic, H.; Myles, S.; Prettyjohns, M.",,5,3
