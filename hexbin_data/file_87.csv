140,140,140,Epigrass: a tool to study disease spread in complex networks,12.778934,4.456941,2008-02-26,"BACKGROUND: The construction of complex spatial simulation models such as those used in network epidemiology, is a daunting task due to the large amount of data involved in their parameterization. Such data, which frequently resides on large geo-referenced databases, has to be processed and assigned to the various components of the model. All this just to construct the model, then it still has to be simulated and analyzed under different epidemiological scenarios. This workflow can only be achieved efficiently by computational tools that can automate most, if not all, these time-consuming tasks. In this paper, we present a simulation software, Epigrass, aimed to help designing and simulating network-epidemic models with any kind of node behavior. RESULTS: A Network epidemiological model representing the spread of a directly transmitted disease through a bus-transportation network connecting mid-size cities in Brazil. Results show that the topological context of the starting point of the epidemic is of great importance from both control and preventive perspectives. CONCLUSION: Epigrass is shown to facilitate greatly the construction, simulation and analysis of complex network models. The output of model results in standard GIS file formats facilitate the post-processing and analysis of results by means of sophisticated GIS software.","Coelho, Flávio C; Cruz, Oswaldo G; Codeço, Cláudia T",Source Code Biol Med,87,17
1373,1373,1373,Long-Distance Travel Behaviours Accelerate and Aggravate the Large-Scale Spatial Spreading of Infectious Diseases,12.775362,4.2924633,2014-01-08,"The study analyses the role of long-distance travel behaviours on the large-scale spatial spreading of directly transmitted infectious diseases, focusing on two different travel types in terms of the travellers travelling to a specific group or not. For this purpose, we have formulated and analysed a metapopulation model in which the individuals in each subpopulation are organised into a scale-free contact network. The long-distance travellers between the subpopulations will temporarily change the network structure of the destination subpopulation through the “merging effects (MEs),” which indicates that the travellers will be regarded as either connected components or isolated nodes in the contact network. The results show that the presence of the MEs has constantly accelerated the transmission of the diseases and aggravated the outbreaks compared to the scenario in which the diversity of the long-distance travel types is arbitrarily discarded. Sensitivity analyses show that these results are relatively constant regarding a wide range variation of several model parameters. Our study has highlighted several important causes which could significantly affect the spatiotemporal disease dynamics neglected by the present studies.","Xu, Zhijing; Zu, Zhenghu; Zheng, Tao; Zhang, Wendou; Xu, Qing; Liu, Jinjie",Comput Math Methods Med,87,22

DESIGN: HIV-1 pol sequence data were analyzed to infer the local transmission network. METHODS: We analyzed HIV-1 pol sequence data to infer a partial local transmission network among 478 recently HIV-1 infected persons and 170 of their sexual and social contacts in San Diego, California. A transmission network score (TNS) was developed to estimate the risk of HIV transmission from a newly diagnosed individual to a new partner and target prevention interventions. RESULTS: HIV-1 pol sequences from 339 individuals (52.3%) were highly similar to sequences from at least one other participant (i.e., clustered). A high TNS (top 25%) was significantly correlated with baseline risk behaviors (number of unique sexual partners and insertive unprotected anal intercourse (p = 0.014 and p = 0.0455, respectively) and predicted risk of transmission (p<0.0001). Retrospective analysis of antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, and simulations of ART targeted to individuals with the highest TNS, showed significantly reduced network level HIV transmission (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sequence data from an HIV-1 screening program focused on recently infected persons and their social and sexual contacts enabled the characterization of a highly connected transmission network. The network-based risk score (TNS) was highly correlated with transmission risk behaviors and outcomes, and can be used identify and target effective prevention interventions, like ART, to those at a greater risk for HIV-1 transmission.","Little, Susan J.; Kosakovsky Pond, Sergei L.; Anderson, Christy M.; Young, Jason A.; Wertheim, Joel O.; Mehta, Sanjay R.; May, Susanne; Smith, Davey M.",PLoS One,87,1
3634,3634,3634,Structured Crowding and Its Effects on Enzyme Catalysis,12.609693,4.4269204,2013-04-10,"Macromolecular crowding decreases the diffusion rate, shifts the equilibrium of protein–protein and protein–substrate interactions, and changes protein conformational dynamics. Collectively, these effects contribute to enzyme catalysis. Here we describe how crowding may bias the conformational change and dynamics of enzyme populations and in this way affect catalysis. Crowding effects have been studied using artificial crowding agents and in vivo-like environments. These studies revealed a correlation between protein dynamics and function in the crowded environment. We suggest that crowded environments be classified into uniform crowding and structured crowding. Uniform crowding represents random crowding conditions created by synthetic particles with a narrow size distribution. Structured crowding refers to the highly coordinated cellular environment, where proteins and other macromolecules are clustered and organized. In structured crowded environments the perturbation of protein thermal stability may be lower; however, it may still be able to modulate functions effectively and dynamically. Dynamic, allosteric enzymes could be more sensitive to cellular perturbations if their free energy landscape is flatter around the native state; on the other hand, if their free energy landscape is rougher, with high kinetic barriers separating deep minima, they could be more robust. Above all, cells are structured; and this holds both for the cytosol and for the membrane environment. The crowded environment is organized, which limits the search, and the crowders are not necessarily inert. More likely, they too transmit allosteric effects, and as such play important functional roles. Overall, structured cellular crowding may lead to higher enzyme efficiency and specificity.","Ma, Buyong; Nussinov, Ruth",Dynamics in Enzyme Catalysis,87,1

We identify that commensals aid in host defense following infection with a neurotropic virus through enhancing microglia function. Germfree mice or animals that receive antibiotics are unable to control viral replication within the brain leading to increased paralysis. Microglia derived from germfree or antibiotic-treated animals cannot stimulate viral-specific immunity and microglia depletion leads to worsened demyelination. Oral administration of toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands to virally infected germfree mice limits neurologic damage. Homeostatic activation of microglia is dependent on intrinsic signaling through TLR4, as disruption of TLR4 within microglia, but not the entire CNS (excluding microglia), leads to increased viral-induced clinical disease. This work demonstrates that gut immune-stimulatory products can influence microglia function to prevent CNS damage following viral infection.","Brown, D Garrett; Soto, Raymond; Yandamuri, Soumya; Stone, Colleen; Dickey, Laura; Gomes-Neto, Joao Carlos; Pastuzyn, Elissa D; Bell, Rickesha; Petersen, Charisse; Buhrke, Kaitlin; Fujinami, Robert S; O'Connell, Ryan M; Stephens, W Zac; Shepherd, Jason D; Lane, Thomas E; Round, June L",,87,1
4818,4818,4818,Human Intolerance to Bacteria as Food,12.452513,4.2004085,1969,"TYPE C viruses of the RD-114 (ref. 1) group have been isolated, either spontaneously or after chemical induction, from cell cultures of the domestic cat (Felis catus)(2–4). Nucleic acid sequences related to the RD-114 genome are in the DNA of all domestic cats(5–8). Thus these viral genomes are transmitted vertically from parent to offspring as integral components of cat cellular DNA. Although the family Felidae consists of closely related animals, only four Felis species have been found to contain RD-114-related sequences. These include the domestic cat, the European wildcat (F. sylvestris), the sand cat (F. margarita), and the jungle cat (F. chaus); other members of the Felidae lack nucleic acid sequences related to RD-114 (ref. 9). The observation that RD-114 is partially related to the endogenous baboon type C viruses(10–12) and that sequences related to RD-114 are found in the cellular DNA of all Old World monkeys led to the postulate that this group of viruses originated from an endogenous primate type C virus(13) transmitted horizontally to the germ line of ancestors of certain Felis species during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene somewhere in the region of the Mediterranean basin(9).","BENVENISTE, RAOUL E.; TODARO, GEORGE J.",Nature,87,11

Our laboratory has taken advantage of 20 years of experience studying the murine immune response to respiratory viruses to address questions of altered immunity during pregnancy. With clinical studies and unique animal model systems, we are working to define the mechanisms responsible for altered immune responses to influenza infection during pregnancy and what roles hormones such as estrogen or progesterone play in these alterations.","Pazos, Michael; Sperling, Rhoda S.; Moran, Thomas M.; Kraus, Thomas A.",Immunol Res,87,1

It is their function in the inflammatory response however that is of most interest to us in the intensive care setting. Over the last three decades we have gained significant insights into leukocyte activation, recruitment and mediator secretion and the contribution of these agents to both the onset and resolution of sepsis and inflammation.¶The body relies on the inflammatory response for protection. Leukocytes occupy a pivotal position in this but to maintain these cells in a state of permanent activation would be unsustainable, with widespread microvascular plugging, uncontrolled free radical release and an excessive metabolic demand. Leukocytes thus circulate in a quiescent state and are rapidly activated by invading pathogens and other stimuli. A direct consequence of this protective strategy is that the inflammatory response may be inadequate, with the risk of overwhelming sepsis, or excessive, leading to rampant systemic inflammation and consequent multiple organ damage.¶It is now becoming apparent however that in addition to leukocytes other cells have important roles both in defence against invading pathogens and in driving malignant inflammation. This review will focus on two new facets of the innate immune system, the Toll family of proteins as the signal transduction element for endotoxin, and the antimicrobial peptides. These exemplify potential damaging and protective response elements but importantly neither are restricted to leukocytes. The capacity of cells and tissues other than the leukocytes to participate and even lead in the inflammatory responses will also be explored.","Bellingan, G",Intensive Care Med,87,1
5807,5807,5807,Plan to pool bird-flu data takes off,12.690745,4.0768895,2006-08-30,"THE photoreceptor G protein, transducin, is one of the class of heterotrimeric G proteins that mediates between membrane receptors and intracellular enzymes or ion channels. Light-activated rhodopsin catalyses the exchange of GDP for GTP on multiple transducin molecules. Activated transducin then stimulates cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase by releasing an inhibitory action of the phosphodiesterase γ-subunits. This leads to a decrease in cGMP levels in the rod, and closure of plasma membrane cationic channels gated by cGMP(1–4). In this and other systems, turn-off of the response requires the GTP bound to G protein to be hydrolysed by an intrinsic GTPase activity(5–7). Here we report that the interaction of transducin with cGMP phosphodiesterase, specifically with its γ-subunits, accelerates GTPase activity by several fold. Thus the γ-subunits of the phosphodiesterase serve a function analogous to the GTPase-activating proteins that regulate the class of small GTP-binding proteins. The acceleration can be partially suppressed by cGMP, most probably through the non-catalytic cGMP-binding sites of phosphodiesterase α and β-subunits. This cGMP regulation may function in light-adaptation of the photo-response as a negative feedback that decreases the lifetime of activated cGMP phosphodiesterase as light causes decreases in cytoplasmic cGMP.","Arshavsky, Vadim Yu.; Bownds, M.

Elution characteristics of the Histo-inhibitory factor (HIF),12.853946,4.3936224,1968,"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether atrial overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) by homogeneous transmural atrial gene transfer can reverse atrial remodeling and its mechanisms in a canine atrial-pacing model. Twenty-eight mongrel dogs were randomly divided into four groups: Sham-operated, AF-control, gene therapy with adenovirus-enhanced green fluorescent protein (Ad-EGFP) and gene therapy with Ad-ACE2 (Ad-ACE2) (n = 7 per subgroup). AF was induced in all dogs except the Sham-operated group by rapid atrial pacing at 450 beats/min for 2 weeks. Ad-EGFP and Ad-ACE2 group then received epicardial gene painting. Three weeks after gene transfer, all animals except the Sham group underwent rapid atrial pacing for another 3 weeks and then invasive electrophysiological, histological and molecular studies. The Ad-ACE2 group showed an increased ACE2 and Angiotensin-(1–7) expression, and decreased Angiotensin II expression in comparison with Ad-EGFP and AF-control group. ACE2 overexpression attenuated rapid atrial pacing-induced increase in activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) levels, and decrease in MAPK phosphatase 1(MKP-1) level, resulting in attenuation of atrial fibrosis collagen protein markers and transforming growth factor-β1. Additionally, ACE2 overexpression also modulated the tachypacing-induced up-regulation of connexin 40, down-regulation of connexin 43 and Kv4.2, and significantly decreased the inducibility and duration of AF. ACE2 overexpression could shift the renin–angiotensin system balance towards the protective axis, attenuate cardiac fibrosis remodeling associated with up-regulation of MKP-1 and reduction of MAPKs activities, modulate tachypacing-induced ion channels and connexin remodeling, and subsequently reduce the inducibility and duration of AF.

Drotrecogin alfa (activated), activated protein C (APC), has been shown in a recent trial to decrease mortality from 44 to 31% in patients with SSS and a high risk of death. We present 3 patients who developed SSS after bariatric surgery and were treated with APC as part of comprehensive therapy for sepsis. Methods: At our institution, patients must have SSS plus an APACHE II score ≥ 25 in order to receive APC. JL is a 43-year-old man who developed SSS (APACHE II score 26) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. ML is a 33-year-old man who developed SSS (APACHE II=28) because of a distal obstruction 2.5 years after gastric bypass surgery. TQ was a 35-year-old man who developed SSS (APACHE II=35) in the setting of laparoscopic banding. Results: After receiving 90% of the 96-hour infusion, JL developed ecchymoses and a decrease in his platelet count; thus, the drug was stopped. ML received a full 96-hour infusion. Both patients made a full recovery from their SSS and were successfully discharged from the hospital. TQ developed septic shock and expired despite all efforts. Conclusion: Weight alone should not be considered a contraindication to the use of APC. Close coordination between the intensivist and surgeon is recommended for bariatric surgery patients with SSS, so that a rapid determination can be made as to the patient's risk of death and eligibility to receive APC.","Savel, Richard H; Pulipati, Ravi C; Mangone-Cholewczynski, Connie; Lazzaro, Richard S; Macura, Jerzy M; Lehman, Herbert E",Obes Surg,87,1

Monoclonal antibodies find application in two main areas: (1) in the field of rapid diagnosis of virus disease in man, animals, and plants and (2) in the extension of virus taxonomy. Monoclonal antibodies may be used to analyze the role of a protein. This ability to distinguish related proteins can be used to provide a genetic marker in recombination experiments.

The differential diagnosis of these infiltrates depends on their timing after transplantation. The aim of this study was to characterize lung transplant recipients (LTR) presenting with new pulmonary infiltrates. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all LTR and heart–lung transplant recipients attending outpatient follow‐up at our institution between September 1, 2006 and October 14, 2011 was performed. All patients presenting with new pulmonary infiltrates on chest x‐ray who underwent bronchoscopy were included. RESULTS: A total of 913 patients accounted for 13,156 attendances, with 3,912 bronchoscopies being performed. Seventy‐eight patients (9%) exhibited new pulmonary infiltrates and proceeded to bronchoscopy. Infiltrates occurred at a median 15 (interquartile range [IQR] 5–39) months after transplantation. Forty‐eight patients (62%) were male, and median patient age was 47 (IQR 29–57) years. Subsequent investigation revealed pneumonia to be the underlying cause in 63 patients (81%). In the remaining patients, chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) was responsible in 6 (8%), acute rejection in 5 (6%), and toxic pneumonitis in 4 (5%) patients. Overall 1‐year survival in LTR presenting with new infiltrates was 97%, compared with 96% for all LTR attending our Outpatient Department.

In this paper, we show that a multiplex structure can greatly affect the spread of an epidemic driven by traffic dynamics. One of the interesting findings is that the multiplex structure could suppress the outbreak of an epidemic, which is different from the typical finding of spread dynamics in multiplex networks. In particular, one layer with dense connections can attract more traffic flow and eventually suppress the epidemic outbreak in other layers. Therefore, the epidemic threshold will be larger than the minimal threshold of the layers. With a mean-field approximation, we provide explicit expressions for the epidemic threshold and for the onset of suppressing epidemic spreading in multiplex networks. We also provide the probability of obtaining a multiplex configuration that suppresses the epidemic spreading when the multiplex is composed of: (i) two Erdős-Rényi layers and (ii) two scale-free layers. Therefore, compared to the situation of an isolated network in which a disease may be able to propagate, a larger epidemic threshold can be found in multiplex structures.","Chen, Jie; Hu, Mao-Bin; Li, Ming",,87,1

The use of random geometric graphs (RGGs) is one of such network models that allows for the consideration of spatial properties on disease propagation. In certain real-world scenarios—like in the analysis of a disease propagating through plants—the shape of the plots and fields where the host of the disease is located may play a fundamental role in the propagation dynamics. Here we consider a generalization of the RGG to account for the variation of the shape of the plots or fields where the hosts of a disease are allocated. We consider a disease propagation taking place on the nodes of a random rectangular graph and we consider a lower bound for the epidemic threshold of a susceptible-infected-susceptible model or a susceptible-infected-recovered model on these networks. Using extensive numerical simulations and based on our analytical results we conclude that (ceteris paribus) the elongation of the plot or field in which the nodes are distributed makes the network more resilient to the propagation of a disease due to the fact that the epidemic threshold increases with the elongation of the rectangle. These results agree with accumulated empirical evidence and simulation results about the propagation of diseases on plants in plots or fields of the same area and different shapes.,"Estrada, Ernesto; Meloni, Sandro; Sheerin, Matthew; Moreno, Yamir",Phys Rev E,87,1

Among them, the evolution of an epidemic is directly related to the individuals' experiences. Indeed, any real epidemic process is clearly sustained by a non-Markovian dynamics: memory effects play an essential role in the spreading of diseases. Including memory effects in the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model seems very appropriate for such an investigation. Thus, the memory prone SIR model dynamics is investigated using fractional derivatives. The decay of long-range memory, taken as a power-law function, is directly controlled by the order of the fractional derivatives in the corresponding nonlinear fractional differential evolution equations. Here we assume “fully mixed” approximation and show that the epidemic threshold is shifted to higher values than those for the memoryless system, depending on this memory “length” decay exponent. We also consider the SIR model on structured networks and study the effect of topology on threshold points in a non-Markovian dynamics. Furthermore, the lack of access to the precise information about the initial conditions or the past events plays a very relevant role in the correct estimation or prediction of the epidemic evolution. Such a “constraint” is analyzed and discussed.","Saeedian, M.; Khalighi, M.; Azimi-Tafreshi, N.; Jafari, G. R.; Ausloos, M.",Phys Rev E,87,1

While the edges determine the connections among the nodes, their specific role in spreading should be considered explicitly. An edge connecting nodes [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] may differ in its importance for spreading from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] and from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text]. The key issue is whether node [Formula: see text] , after infected by [Formula: see text] through the edge, would reach out to other nodes that [Formula: see text] itself could not reach directly. It becomes necessary to invoke two unequal weights [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] characterizing the importance of an edge according to the neighborhoods of nodes [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. The total asymmetric directional weights originating from a node leads to a novel measure [Formula: see text] , which quantifies the impact of the node in spreading processes. An [Formula: see text]-shell decomposition scheme further assigns an [Formula: see text]-shell index or weighted coreness to the nodes. The effectiveness and accuracy of rankings based on [Formula: see text] and the weighted coreness are demonstrated by applying them to nine real-world networks. Results show that they generally outperform rankings based on the nodes' degree and [Formula: see text]-shell index while maintaining a low computational complexity.

Vaccination, whenever available, is the best way to prevent the spreading, because it eventually immunizes individuals. However, vaccines are not perfect, and total immunization is not guaranteed. Imperfect immunization has driven the emergence of antivaccine movements that totally alter the predictions about the epidemic incidence. Here, we propose a mathematically solvable mean-field vaccination model to mimic the spontaneous adoption of vaccines against influenzalike diseases and the expected epidemic incidence. The results are in agreement with extensive Monte Carlo simulations of the epidemics and vaccination coevolutionary processes. Interestingly, the results reveal a nonmonotonic behavior on the vaccination coverage that increases with the imperfection of the vaccine and after decreases. This apparent counterintuitive behavior is analyzed and understood from stability principles of the proposed mathematical model.","Steinegger, Benjamin; Cardillo, Alessio; Rios, Paolo De Los; Gómez-Gardeñes, Jesús; Arenas, Alex",,87,1

Generalizing the theory of large fluctuations to random networks with a given degree distribution, we are able to predict the most probable, or optimal, paths to extinction in various configurations, including truncated power laws. We find that paths for heterogeneous networks follow a limiting form in which infection first decreases in low-degree nodes, which triggers a rapid extinction in high-degree nodes, and finishes with a residual low-degree extinction. The usefulness of our approach is further demonstrated through optimal control strategies that leverage the dependence of finite-size fluctuations on network topology. Interestingly, we find that the optimal control is a mix of treating both high- and low-degree nodes based on theoretical predictions, in contrast to methods that ignore dynamical fluctuations.","Hindes, Jason; Schwartz, Ira B.",Phys Rev Lett,87,1

We perform explicit calculations for two canonical and distinct classes of rare events: network extinction and switching. When the distance to threshold is held constant, and hence stochastic effects are fairly compared among networks, we show that there is a universal, exponential increase in the rate of rare events proportional to the variance of a network’s degree distribution over its mean squared.","Hindes, Jason; Assaf, Michael",,87,1

Despite increasing interest in treatment strategies limiting oxygen exposure in ICU patients, no trials have compared conservative vs. usual oxygen in patients with sepsis. METHODS: We undertook a post hoc analysis of the 251 patients with sepsis enrolled in a trial that compared conservative oxygen therapy with usual oxygen therapy in 1000 mechanically ventilated ICU patients. The primary end point for the current analysis was 90-day mortality. Key secondary outcomes were cause-specific mortality, ICU and hospital length of stay, ventilator-free days, vasopressor-free days, and the proportion of patients receiving renal replacement therapy in the ICU. RESULTS: Patients with sepsis allocated to conservative oxygen therapy spent less time in the ICU with an SpO(2) ≥ 97% (23.5 h [interquartile range (IQR) 8–70] vs. 47 h [IQR 11–93], absolute difference, 23 h; 95% CI 8–38), and more time receiving an FiO(2) of 0.21 than patients allocated to usual oxygen therapy (20.5 h [IQR 1–79] vs. 0 h [IQR 0–10], absolute difference, 20 h; 95% CI 14–26). At 90-days, 47 of 130 patients (36.2%) assigned to conservative oxygen and 35 of 120 patients (29.2%) assigned to usual oxygen had died (absolute difference, 7 percentage points; 95% CI − 4.6 to 18.6% points; P = 0.24; interaction P = 0.35 for sepsis vs. non-sepsis). There were no statistically significant differences between groups for secondary outcomes but point estimates of treatment effects consistently favored usual oxygen therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Point estimates for the treatment effect of conservative oxygen therapy on 90-day mortality raise the possibility of clinically important harm with this intervention in patients with sepsis; however, our post hoc analysis was not powered to detect the effects suggested and our data do not exclude clinically important benefit or harm from conservative oxygen therapy in this patient group.

With the raising obesity risk, key aspects to consider are accurate body mass index classification, as well as metabolic and cardiovascular, and hepatic consequences. DATA SOURCES: The authors performed a systematic literature search in PubMed and EMBASE, using selected key words (obesity, childhood, cardiovascular, liver health). In particular, they focused their search on papers evaluating the impact of obesity on cardiovascular and liver health. RESULTS: We evaluated the current literature dealing with the impact of excessive body fat accumulation in childhood and across adulthood, as a predisposing factor to cardiovascular and hepatic alterations. We also evaluated the impact of physical and dietary behaviors starting from childhood on cardio-metabolic consequences. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemic of obesity and obesity-related comorbidities worldwide raises concerns about the impact of early abnormalities during childhood and adolescence. Two key abnormalities in this context include cardiovascular diseases, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Appropriate metabolic screenings and associated comorbidities should start as early as possible in obese children and adolescents. Nevertheless, improving dietary intake and increasing physical activity performance are to date the best therapeutic tools in children to weaken the onset of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes risk during adulthood.","Faienza, Maria Felicia; Chiarito, Mariangela; Molina-Molina, Emilio; Shanmugam, Harshitha; Lammert, Frank; Krawczyk, Marcin; D’Amato, Gabriele; Portincasa, Piero",World J Pediatr,87,17

Safety is provided not by attenuation or inactivation of vaccine viruses, but by the introduction into the viral genomes of genetic mechanisms that allow for stringent, deliberate spatial and temporal control of virus replication. The resulting replication-competent controlled viruses (RCCVs) can be activated to undergo one or, if desired, several rounds of efficient replication at the inoculation site, but are nonreplicating in the absence of activation. Extrapolating from observations that attenuated replicating viruses are better immunogens than replication-defective or inactivated viruses, it was hypothesized that RCCVs that replicate with wild-type-like efficiency when activated will be even better immunogens. The vigorous replication of the RCCVs should also render heterologous antigens expressed from them highly immunogenic. RCCVs for administration to skin sites or mucosal membranes were constructed using a virulent wild-type HSV-1 strain as the backbone. The recombinants are activated by a localized heat treatment to the inoculation site in the presence of a small-molecule regulator (SMR). Derivatives expressing influenza virus antigens were also prepared. Immunization/challenge experiments in mouse models revealed that the activated RCCVs induced far better protective immune responses against themselves as well as against the heterologous antigens they express than unactivated RCCVs or a replication-defective HSV-1 strain. Neutralizing antibody and proliferation responses mirrored these findings. We believe that the data obtained so far warrant further research to explore the possibility of developing effective RCCV-based vaccines directed to herpetic diseases and/or diseases caused by other pathogens.","Voellmy, Richard; Bloom, David C; Vilaboa, Nuria",Vaccines (Basel),87,1

We examined trends in rotavirus group A (RVA) genotype distribution pre- (January 2010–June 2014) and post- (July 2014–December 2018) RVA vaccine introduction. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from children aged < 13 years from four surveillance sites across Kenya: Kilifi County Hospital, Tabitha Clinic Nairobi, Lwak Mission Hospital, and Siaya County Referral Hospital (children aged < 5 years only). Samples were screened for RVA using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and VP7 and VP4 genes sequenced to infer genotypes. RESULTS: We genotyped 614 samples in pre-vaccine and 261 in post-vaccine introduction periods. During the pre-vaccine introduction period, the most frequent RVA genotypes were G1P [8] (45.8%), G8P [4] (15.8%), G9P [8] (13.2%), G2P [4] (7.0%) and G3P [6] (3.1%). In the post-vaccine introduction period, the most frequent genotypes were G1P [8] (52.1%), G2P [4] (20.7%) and G3P [8] (16.1%). Predominant genotypes varied by year and site in both pre and post-vaccine periods. Temporal genotype patterns showed an increase in prevalence of vaccine heterotypic genotypes, such as the commonly DS-1-like G2P [4] (7.0 to 20.7%, P < .001) and G3P [8] (1.3 to 16.1%, P < .001) genotypes in the post-vaccine introduction period. Additionally, we observed a decline in prevalence of genotypes G8P [4] (15.8 to 0.4%, P < .001) and G9P [8] (13.2 to 5.4%, P < .001) in the post-vaccine introduction period. Phylogenetic analysis of genotype G1P [8], revealed circulation of strains of lineages G1-I, G1-II and P [8]-1, P [8]-III and P [8]-IV. Considerable genetic diversity was observed between the pre and post-vaccine strains, evidenced by distinct clusters. CONCLUSION: Genotype prevalence varied from before to after vaccine introduction. Such observations emphasize the need for long-term surveillance to monitor vaccine impact. These changes may represent natural secular variation or possible immuno-epidemiological changes arising from the introduction of the vaccine. Full genome sequencing could provide insights into post-vaccine evolutionary pressures and antigenic diversity.","Mwanga, Mike J.; Owor, Betty E.; Ochieng, John B.; Ngama, Mwanajuma H.; Ogwel, Billy; Onyango, Clayton; Juma, Jane; Njeru, Regina; Gicheru, Elijah; Otieno, Grieven P.; Khagayi, Sammy; Agoti, Charles N.; Bigogo, Godfrey M.; Omore, Richard; Addo, O.

To develop the relation between technical mediation and ethics, firstly the theme of technical mediation is elaborated in line with Foucault’s notion of ethical problematization. Every view of what technology does to us at the same time expresses an ethical concern about technology. The contemporary conception of technical mediation tends towards the acknowledgement of ongoing hybridization, not ultimately good or bad but ambivalent, which means for us the challenge of taking care of ourselves as hybrid beings. Secondly, the work of Foucault provides elements for imagining this care for our hybrid selves, notably his notions of freedom as a practice and of the care of the self. A conclusions about technical mediation and ethics is that whereas the approaches of the delegation of morality to technology by Latour and mediated morality by Verbeek see technical mediation of behavior and moral outlook as an answer in ethics, this should rather be considered the problem that ethics is about.","Dorrestijn, Steven",Found Sci,87,1

Quality of life of these individuals is not on par with global standards. The decline in quality of life can be attributed to lack of a specialised rehabilitation centres, lack of expertise in local hospitals and lack of access to dedicated SCI wards/centres in India. The present case report depicts many such challenges in India. CASE PRESENTATION: As part of an online focus group, A 21-year-old male was identified who sustained SCI in motor vehicle. His care was inappropriate at the accident site. He was not taught basic skills such as bed mobility, transfers, and wheel-chair mobility and was not educated about long-term complications before discharged to home. Lack of training made him functionally dependent on others for his basic needs. There were few job opportunities for him in his state. He strongly emphasises the need to create an awareness regarding SCI among the general public in India. DISCUSSION: This case report depicts many challenges faced by a person with paraplegia in India. These include mishandling at the accident site, lack of adequate care post injury and lack of follow-up post discharge. In addition, lack of knowledge of SCI among the general public and lack of education regarding SCI for the patient and his care givers post injury are reported.","Gupta, Nalina",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,87,13

This issue could be addressed with the help of telehealth technology, which may be used in LMICs without economic concerns. CASE PRESENTATIONS: A 44-year-old male with C3 AIS C SCI and a 35-year-old female with T12 AIS A SCI were discharged after successful rehabilitation from a tertiary care spinal center. The patients demonstrated gradual loss in their independence, which was evident by monitoring their home activities biweekly for 4 weeks via a combination of telephone calls, live video chat, and WhatsApp. Subsequently after 4 weeks of consistent guidance, pre–post scores after teletherapy were analyzed for the self-care and mobility subcomponents of the self-reported SCIM III. DISCUSSION: After consistent supervised guidance via telehealth, self-care scores improved in the C3 AIS C case from 3 to 15 and in the T12 AIS A case from 4 to 15, while mobility scores respectively improved from 14 to 27 and 4 to 16. Identification of individual competencies, performance, and capacity in activities of daily living and participation, self-assessment, caregiver training, and home integration contributed toward successful community integration.

While the etiologies of PPH are incompletely understood, it is thought to occur when glucose absorption causes increased splanchnic blood flow or “pooling” in people who lack sufficient compensatory responses to support their systemic blood pressure. Postprandial hypotension is well described in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases, yet only rarely in people living with spinal cord injury (SCI). Acarbose is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that treats PPH by slowing gastric transit time and reducing glucose uptake in the small intestine, hence decreasing superior mesenteric artery blood flow. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old woman with long-standing cervical SCI presented with 5 years of worsening postprandial lightheadedness, visual “flashes”, and neck pain. She had had multiple episodes of near and frank syncope and her prior medical team had initiated midodrine three times daily. We began treatment with acarbose, starting at 50 mg with each meal and rapidly titrating to 100 mg at mealtime. She noticed an immediate improvement in her symptoms and an attenuation of postmeal drops in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is one of the first described cases of PPH among people living with SCI. Given the autonomic dysfunction that frequently accompanies higher-level of injuries, it is possible that many more people with SCI have this condition, whether or not it is symptomatic. Acarbose is one of the several established treatments for PPH, and proved effective and tolerable for our patient.","Farrehi, Clara; Pazzi, Carlotta; Stillman, Michael",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,87,13

Average post-operative refractive cylinder in TIOL group was 1.35 DC (SD 0.84 DC) and in LRI group 1.91 DC (SD 1.07 DC) (P = 0.01; 95% CI: −1, −0.12). Mean difference vector magnitude was 1.92 DC (SD 1.08 DC) in LRI group and 1.37 DC (SD 0.84 DC) in TIOL group (P = 0.02; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: TIOLs with a fixed 2.00 DC correction during cataract surgery may improve UDVA, reduce post-operative cylinder and result in a more reliable astigmatic correction compared with monofocal IOLs with LRIs.","Stanojcic, Nick; Roberts, Harry; Wagh, Vijay; Zuberbuhler, Bruno; O’Brart, David",Eye (Lond),87,1

This study presents a practical/systematic framework that enables the provision of information on the research goals, the status of science and technology, and action plans of aging-related program development processes. We used data on aging-related national-funded projects from the United States of America, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Korea. We collected data on 6318 national-funded projects, subsequently designating research fields to each project. By analyzing the content of the projects, their representative research fields, and the associated keywords, we assessed the general goals of six different research fields. To recognize the current scientific capabilities of these research fields, we divided the projects by clusters. We provided information on research organizations, specific goals (i.e., project title), project periods, and the funding related to the projects. These may be used by stakeholders in various governments/institutions/industries during future discussions regarding the establishment of an international R&D collaboration strategy. The approach we proposed may facilitate the linkage between knowledge and action during strategy development by maximizing scientific legitimacy, developing consensual knowledge, and minimizing diverging opinions among stakeholders.","Lee, Doyeon; Kim, Seungwook; Kim, Keunhwan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,87,1

Therefore, investigation of fucosylation in the interaction of gastric epithelial cells with H. pylori is critical. In this study we used lectin microarrays to detect the expression of fucosylated glycans in gastric epithelial cells (GES-1) infected with H. pylori strains isolated from patients with different diseases including chronic gastritis, duodenal ulcers, and gastric cancer (each containing two strains) at 4 h. In addition, we investigated the time-course expression of fucosyltransferase (FUT) 1–6 genes in GES-1 cells stimulated with H. pylori strains at 0.5–8 h. At 4 h post-infection, Lotus, AAA, BC2LCN, PA-IIL, CNL and ACG lectins had increased signals in H. pylori-infected GES-1 cells compared to uninfected cells. Higher expression of FUT1 and FUT2 was detected in all H. pylori-infected GES-1 cells within 2 h, regardless of the H. pylori strain. In particular, the expression of FUT2 was higher in H. pylori-infected GES-1 cells with a higher fold change in levels of BC2LCN lectin specific to α1-2 linked fucose (Fuc) at 4 h. The results suggest that the high levels of α1, 2-linked Fuc synthesized by FUT1/2, might play a role in the preliminary stage of H. pylori infection. This provides us with pivotal information to understand the adhesion of H. pylori to human gastric epithelial cells.","Fan, Ruyue; Han, Xiurui; Gong, Yanan; He, Lihua; Xue, Zhijing; Yang, Yaming; Sun, Lu; Fan, Dongjie; You, Yuanhai; Meng, Fanliang; Yan, Xiaomei; Zhang, Maojun; Zhang, Jianzhong",Pathogens,87,1

In the United Kingdom, studies using secondary data sources have documented temporal variations in levels of arts engagement in the population, its determinants and its mental wellbeing implications. However, arts engagement is often characterized by prioritizing “high-brow” art forms. In this article, we introduce the HEartS Survey, a tool that aims to increase the balance between inclusivity and brevity of existing arts engagement measures and to focus specifically on the connection between arts engagement and social wellbeing. We explore trends in participatory and receptive engagement with literary, visual, performing, crafts and decorative arts among 5,338 adults in the UK in 2018–2019 using summative engagement scores and cluster analysis. Regression models, adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, health, and social covariates, examine correlations between arts engagement and psychological and social wellbeing measures. Over 97% of respondents reported engagement in one or more arts activities at least once during 2018–2019, with reading and listening to music being the most popular activities. Arts engagement grouped into three distinct clusters: 19.8% constituted “low engagers” whose main source of engagement was occasional reading; 44.4% constituted “receptive consumers” who read and listened to music frequently and engaged with popular receptive arts activities such as cinema, live music, theater, exhibitions, and museums; and 35.8% constituted “omnivores” who frequently engaged in almost all arts activities. In agreement with existing studies, more arts engagement was associated with higher levels of wellbeing, social connectedness, and lower odds of intense social loneliness. In contrast, we found a positive association between more arts engagement, depression, and intense emotional loneliness for the most highly engaged omnivores. We conclude that arts engagement in the population forms specific profiles with distinct characteristics and consider implications for mental and social wellbeing.","Tymoszuk, Urszula; Spiro, Neta; Perkins, Rosie; Mason-Bertrand, Adele; Gee, Kate; Williamon, Aaron",PLoS One,87,1

Targeting the genes encoding such proteins paves the way for controlling these parasites. Centrin is an essential gene, which its protein product seems to be vital for the proliferation of Leishmania parasites. Herein, this study was contrived to analyze the expression level of the centrin gene in different growth phases and forms of Leishmania infantum (L. infantum) parasites isolated from various endemic areas of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) in Iran. RESULTS: All three collected isolates were identified as L. infantum using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR revealed a statistically significant up-regulation (3.13-fold) in the logarithmic phase promastigotes compared to stationary ones (p < 0.01), whereas centrin was expressed equally in intracellular amastigotes at different time points during cell culture. Also, our finding revealed a slight up-regulation of the centrin gene (1.22-fold) in the intracellular amastigotes compared to logarithmic phase promastigotes, which was found statistically non-significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Centrin gene in Iranian isolates of L. infantum is more expressed in exponential than stationary phases and seems to be considered as a promising target in the development of a genetically modified live attenuated vaccine for CanL control.","Abbaszadeh Afshar, Mohammad Javad; Elikaee, Samira; Saberi, Reza; Mohtasebi, Sina; Mohebali, Mehdi",BMC Vet Res,87,1

Phylogenetic analyses reveal ongoing evolution of the predominant circulating genotype 2.VII, and the relevance of potential antigenic drift is under discussion. To investigate variation within neutralization-sensitive epitopes within the protein responsible for receptor binding, i.e. the Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase (HN) spike protein, we were interested in establishing genotype-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). METHODS: An HN-enriched fraction of a gradient-purified NDV genotype 2.VII was prepared and successfully employed to induce antibodies in BalbC mice that recognize conformationally intact sites reactive by haemagglutination inhibition (HI). For subsequent screening of mouse hybridoma cultures, an NDV-ELISA was established that utilizes Concanavalin A (ConA-ELISA) coupled glycoproteins proven to present conformation-dependent epitopes. RESULTS: Six out of nine selected MAbs were able to block receptor binding as demonstrated by HI activity. One MAb recognized an epitope only present in the homologue virus, while four other MAbs showed weak reactivity to selected other genotypes. On the other hand, one broadly cross-reacting MAb reacted with all genotypes tested and resembled the reactivity profile of genotype-specific polyclonal antibody preparations that point to minor antigenic differences between tested NDV genotpyes. CONCLUSIONS: These results point to the concurrent presence of variable and conserved epitopes within the HN molecule of NDV. The described protocol should help to generate MAbs against a variety of NDV strains and to enable in depth analysis of the antigenic profiles of different genotypes.

Here, as a result of experimental manipulations, we present, for the first time ever, evidence supporting the use of a new channel of intraspecific communication by a mammal species, i.e., brown bear Ursus arctos adult males relying on visual marks during mating.

Its use, however, is limited by its rare but severe ophthalmological complications. Here, we aimed to analyse factors associated with HCQ retinopathy including HCQ blood levels. METHODS: This case–control study compared SLE patients with and without HCQ retinopathy, defined by abnormal results for at least two of the following ophthalmological tests: automated visual fields, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) and fundus autofluorescence. We compared clinical and laboratory findings to assess risk factors for HCQ retinopathy. RESULTS: The study included 23 patients with confirmed retinopathy (cases) and 547 controls. In the univariate analysis, age (P < 0.001), height (P = 0.045), creatinine clearance (P < 0.001), haemoglobin concentration (P = 0.01), duration of HCQ intake, (P < 0.001), higher cumulative HCQ dose (P < 0.001) and geographical origin (West Indies and sub-Saharan Africa) (P = 0.007) were associated with the risk of retinopathy, while HCQ blood levels were not. In the multivariate analysis, only cumulative dose (P = 0.016), duration of intake (P = 0.039), creatinine clearance (P = 0.002) and geographical origin (P < 0.0001, odds ratio 8.7) remained significantly associated with retinopathy. CONCLUSION: SLE patients on HCQ should be closely monitored for retinopathy, especially those from the West Indies or sub-Saharan Africa, or with renal insufficiency, longer HCQ intake or a high cumulative dose. Although reducing the daily dose of HCQ in patients with persistently high HCQ blood levels seems logical, these concentrations were not associated with retinopathy in this study with controls adherent to treatment.","Lenfant, Tiphaine; Salah, Sawsen; Leroux, Gaëlle; Bousquet, Elodie; Le Guern, Véronique; Chasset, François; Francès, Camille; Morel, Nathalie; Chezel, Julie; Papo, Thomas; Cacoub, Patrice; Mouthon, Luc; Guettrot-Imbert, Gaëlle; Cohen, Pascal; Régent, Alexis; Mauget-Faÿsse, Martine; Piette, Jean-Charles; Jallouli, Moez; Costedoat-Chalumeau, Nathalie",Rheumatology (Oxford),87,22

An estimated 3 billion native animals, and whole ecosystems, were impacted by the bushfires, with many endangered species pushed closer to extinction. Zoos Victoria was part of a state-led bushfire response to assist wildlife, alongside government, non-government organisations, and key partners. Here, we detail the role of Zoos Victoria in wildlife triage and welfare, threatened species evacuation and recovery, media and communications, and fundraising during and after the fires. We provide case studies on the triage, care, release, and monitoring of injured koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus); the evacuation and return of endangered eastern bristlebirds (Dasyornis brachypterus) and brush-tailed rock wallabies (Petrogale penicillata); and the development of nutritionally suitable supplementary food and emergency feeding of critically endangered mountain pygmy-possums (Burramys parvus). We share our strategies for future resilience and readiness for similar catastrophic events, as well as the development of triage protocols, emergency response kits, emergency enclosures, captive breeding programs, and nature-based healing for communities directly affected by the fires. We hope that by outlining these contributions from a zoo-based conservation organisation, other zoos and wildlife organisations, both nationally and internationally, may be assisted or encouraged to commit resources and build expertise to assist wildlife in catastrophic events. ABSTRACT: Modern zoos are increasingly taking a leading role in emergency management and wildlife recovery. In the face of climate change and the predicted increase in frequency and magnitude of catastrophic events, zoos provide specialised expertise to assist wildlife welfare and endangered species recovery. In the 2019–2020 Australian bushfire season, now called Australia’s Black Summer, a state government-directed response was developed, assembling specialised individuals and organisations from government, non-government organisations, research institutions, and others. Here, we detail the role of Zoos Victoria staff in wildlife triage and welfare, threatened species evacuation and recovery, media and communications, and fundraising during and after the fires. We share strategies for future resilience, readiness, and the ability to mobilise quickly in catastrophic events. The development of triage protocols, emergency response kits, emergency enclosures, and expanded and new captive breeding programs is underway, as are programs for care of staff mental health and nature-based community healing for people directly affected by the fires. We hope this account of our response to one of the greatest recent threats to Australia’s biodiversity, and steps to prepare for the future will assist other zoos and wildlife organisations around the world in preparations to help wildlife before, during, and after catastrophic events.","Parrott, Marissa L.; Wicker, Leanne V.; Lamont, Amanda; Banks, Chris; Lang, Michelle; Lynch, Michael; McMeekin, Bonnie; Miller, Kimberly A.; Ryan, Fiona; Selwood, Katherine E.; Sherwen, Sally L.; Whiteford, Craig",Animals (Basel),87,1

One potential complication of gallbladder disease is that gallstones can pass into the common bile duct (CBD) where they may remain dormant, pass spontaneously into the bowel or cause problems such as obstructive jaundice or pancreatitis. Patients requiring LC are assessed preoperatively for their risk of CBD stones using liver function tests and imaging. If the risk is high, guidelines recommend further investigation and treatment. Further investigation of patients at low or moderate risk of CBD stones is not standardised, and the practice of imaging the CBD using magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in these patients varies across the UK. The consequences of these decisions may lead to overtreatment or undertreatment of patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are conducting a UK multicentre, pragmatic, open, randomised controlled trial with internal pilot phase to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of preoperative imaging with MRCP versus expectant management (ie, no preoperative imaging) in adult patients with symptomatic gallbladder disease undergoing urgent or elective LC who are at low or moderate risk of CBD stones. We aim to recruit 13 680 patients over 48 months. The primary outcome is any hospital admission within 18 months of randomisation for a complication of gallstones. This includes complications of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for the treatment of gallstones and complications of LC. This will be determined using routine data sources, for example, National Health Service Digital Hospital Episode Statistics for participants in England. Secondary outcomes include cost-effectiveness and patient-reported quality of life, with participants followed up for a median of 18 months.

Treatment with anti-inflammatory corticosteroids has been widely debated but is not generally recommended in veterinary medicine. The objective of the present study was to present current evidence on the effect of corticosteroid treatment for acute/acute-on-chronic pancreatitis across species. These findings were then used to evaluate if and how corticosteroid treatment could influence disease outcome in canine acute/acute-on-chronic pancreatitis. A scoping review was performed by searching the Agricola, CAB Abstracts, MEDLINE and Embase databases to identify relevant articles published before June 24, 2021. The inclusion criteria were English language, original research published in a peer-reviewed journal, and investigation of corticosteroid treatment effects on acute/acute-on-chronic pancreatitis by the outcome parameters clinical score, circulating CRP level, hospitalisation duration, mortality and pancreas histopathology. Research on any species was considered. Studies were rated based on the level of evidence, and methodological quality was evaluated based on similarity between groups at baseline, risk of bias and study group size. The reporting method was based on the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews. One thousand nine hundred fifty-four studies were identified, and 31 met the inclusion criteria. Five were canine studies, with 4 investigating experimentally induced pancreatitis; 5 were human clinical studies; and 21 were rodent studies of experimentally induced pancreatitis. The level of evidence ranged between randomised controlled trials and case series, the estimated risk of bias ranged from low to high, and the sample sizes ranged from very small to moderate. Evidence indicates that adding corticosteroid to symptomatic treatment of acute/acute-on-chronic canine pancreatitis could have a positive influence on disease outcome. However, the analysed evidence was based on several species, including both naturally occurring and experimentally induced pancreatitis; thus, the authors suggest that large randomised controlled studies should be performed in dogs with spontaneously occurring acute/acute-on-chronic pancreatitis to further elucidate a potential benefit of corticosteroid treatment.

Recent studies have shown the efficacy of rTM through its anti-inflammatory effects for treatment of adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the safety and efficacy of rTM in children with severe ARDS complicated by DIC have not been reported. In this preliminary study, we reported the feasibility of using rTM for the treatment of pneumonia-induced severe ARDS complicated by DIC in children. METHODS: Six children (age: median 10 months old) with pneumonia-induced severe ARDS complicated by DIC were enrolled in this preliminary study. rTM (380 U/kg) was administered for a maximum of 6 days, in addition to conventional therapies after diagnosis of severe ARDS complicated by DIC. After administration of rTM, we measured changes in the plasma TM concentration and evaluated the clinical course, status of DIC and ARDS, and other laboratory findings, including levels of cytokines, chemokines, and biomarkers. RESULTS: In all six children, the plasma concentration of TM increased and DIC scores decreased after administration of rTM. Four of the six children recovered from the severe ARDS complicated by DIC after treatment, and were discharged from the hospital with no complications. In survived children, levels of soluble receptors for advanced glycation end products, interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 decreased after administration of rTM compared to those before rTM.

We conducted a retrospective observational study to determine how long TCZ controls RA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of RA patients treated with TCZ. The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of clinical parameters to disease control time (DCT) in RA patients. RESULTS: Overall, 144 patients were enrolled in the study. The median age of patients was 66 years (range: 34–85 years). In univariate analysis, DCT was significantly increased in patients who had never received previous biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs treatment (P = 0.0064). We also analyzed the contribution of the base line value of C-reactive protein (CRP) to DCT. We divided the patients with RA into two groups according to a cutoff value of 1.000 mg/dl. The median control times were 77.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 44.8–not reached to median) and 34.5 months (95% CI: 17.0–79.3) for patients with high and low CRP value, respectively. In univariate analysis, DCT was significantly increased in patients with a high CRP value (P = 0.0283). Multivariate analysis clearly revealed that a high baseline CRP value was an independent favorable predictive factor for longer DCT (hazard ratio, 0.608, 95% CI: 0.378–0.981, P = 0.0416). CONCLUSION: These data clearly demonstrate that the baseline value of CRP was closely associated with long time DCT in patients of RA treated with TCZ.","Ishii, Nobuyasu; Shimizu, Toshiki; Ishiura, Yoshihisa; Amuro, Hideki; Nishizawa, Tohru; Tamaki, Takeshi; Nomura, Shosaku",J Inflamm Res,87,1

Here, we asked whether combination adjuvants based on delta inulin (Advax) formulated with Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists could improve vaccine protection mediated by a fungal recombinant protein, Bl-Eng2 (i.e., Blastomyces endoglucanase 2), which itself harbors an immunodominant antigen and dectin-2 agonist/adjuvant. We found that Bl-Eng2 formulated with Advax3 containing TLR9 agonist or Advax8 containing TLR4 agonist provided the best protection against pulmonary infection with Blastomyces dermatitidis, being more effective than complete Freund’s adjuvant or Adjuplex. Advax3 was most efficient in inducing gamma interferon (IFN-γ)- and interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing antigen-specific T cells that migrated to the lung upon Blastomyces dermatitidis infection. Mechanistic studies revealed Bl-Eng2/Advax3 protection was tempered by neutralization of IL-17 and particularly IFN-γ. Likewise, greater numbers of lung-resident T cells producing IFN-γ, IL-17, or both IFN-γ and IL-17 correlated with fewer fungi recovered from lung. Protection was maintained after depletion of CD4(+) T cells, partially reduced by depletion of CD8(+) T cells, and completely eliminated after depletion of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. We conclude that Bl-Eng2 formulated with Advax3 is promising for eliciting vaccine-induced antifungal immunity, through a previously uncharacterized mechanism involving CD8(+) and also CD4(+) T cells producing IFN-γ and/or IL-17. Although no licensed vaccine exists as yet against any fungal disease, these findings indicate the importance of adjuvant selection for the development of effective fungal vaccines.","Wüthrich, Marcel; Dobson, Hannah E.; Ledesma Taira, Cleison; Okaa, Uju Joy; dos Santos Dias, Lucas; Isidoro-Ayza, Marcos; Petrovsky, Nikolai; Klein, Bruce S.",,87,1

In this paper, we report a new method to recover the phylogeny of haplotypes from short-read sequences obtained using pooled amplicons from a mixture of individuals, without barcoding. The method, AFPhyloMix, accepts an alignment of the mixture of reads against a reference sequence, obtains the single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNP) patterns along the alignment, and constructs the phylogenetic tree according to the SNP patterns. AFPhyloMix adopts a Bayesian inference model to estimate the phylogeny of the haplotypes and their relative abundances, given that the number of haplotypes is known. In our simulations, AFPhyloMix achieved at least 80% accuracy at recovering the phylogenies and relative abundances of the constituent haplotypes, for mixtures with up to 15 haplotypes. AFPhyloMix also worked well on a real data set of kangaroo mitochondrial DNA sequences.","Wong, Thomas K.

In Honour of Martial Van Der Linden",12.761865,4.2379756,2021-09-15,"Since the 19(th )century, appropriate lymphadenectomy has been considered a cornerstone of oncologic surgery and one of the most important prognostic factors. This approach can be applied to any surgery for gastrointestinal cancer. During surgery for colon and rectal cancer, an adequate portion of the mesentery is removed together with the segment of bowel affected by the disease. The adequate number of lymph nodes to be removed is standardized and reported by several guidelines. It is mandatory to determine the appropriate extent of lymphadenectomy and to balance its oncological benefits with the increased morbidity associated with its execution in cancer patients. Our review focuses on the concept of “complete mesenteric excision (CME) with central vascular ligation (CVL),” a radical lymphadenectomy for colorectal cancer that has gained increasing interest in recent years. The aim of this study was to evaluate the evolution of this approach over the years, its potential oncologic benefits and potential risks, and the improvements offered by laparoscopic techniques. Theoretical advantages of CME are improved local-relapse rates due to complete removal of the intact mesocolic fascia and improved distance recurrence rates due to ligation of vessels at their origin (CVL) which guarantees removal of a larger number of lymph nodes. The development and worldwide diffusion of laparoscopic techniques minimized postoperative trauma in oncologic surgery, providing the same oncologic results as open surgery. This has been widely applied to colorectal cancer surgery; however, CME entails a technical complexity that can limit its wide minimally-invasive application. This review analyzes results of these procedures in terms of oncological outcomes, technical feasibility and complexity, especially within the context of minimally invasive surgery.","Franceschilli, Marzia; Di Carlo, Sara; Vinci, Danilo; Sensi, Bruno; Siragusa, Leandro; Bellato, Vittoria; Caronna, Roberto; Rossi, Piero; Cavallaro, Giuseppe; Guida, Andrea; Sibio, Simone",World J Clin Cases,87,1

To address the problem, RNA interference (RNAi) has recently been widely used as a potential antiviral approach. Transgenesis, in combination with RNAi to specifically inhibit AIV gene expression, has been proposed to make chickens resistant to avian influenza. For the transgenic breeding, screening the efficient siRNAs in vitro as the candidate genes is one of the most important tasks. Here, we combined an online search tool and a series of bioinformatics programs with a set of rules for designing the siRNAs targeting different mRNA regions of AIV H5N1 subtype. By this method we chose five rational siRNAs, constructed five U6 promoter-driven shRNA expression plasmids contained the siRNA genes, and used these to produce stably transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Data from virus titration, IFA, PUI-stained flow cytometry, real-time quantitative RT-PCR and DAS-ELISA analyses showed that all five stably transfected cell lines were effectively resistant to viral replication when exposed to 100 CCID50 of AIV, and we finally chose the most effective plasmids (pSi-604i and pSi-1597i) as the candidates for making the transgenic chickens. These findings provide baseline information for breeding transgenic chickens resistant to AIV in combination with RNAi.","Zhang, P.; Wang, J. G.; Wan, J. Y.; Liu, W. Q.",Mol Biol,87,1

However, these plants are not suitable for administration without cooking. To overcome this obstacle, a fusion gene encoding the synthetic enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit genetically fused with a synthetic neutralizing epitope of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (sLTB-sCOE) was introduced into lettuce cells (Lactuca sativa) by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation methods. The integration and expression of the sLTB-sCOE fusion gene was confirmed in transgenic lettuce by genomic DNA PCR amplification and Northern blot analysis, respectively. Synthesis and assembly of the LTB-COE fusion protein into oligomeric structures with pentamer size were observed in transgenic plant extracts by Western blot analysis with anti-LTB or anti-COE antibodies. The binding of plantproduced LTB-COE to intestinal epithelial cell membrane glycolipid receptors was confirmed by G(M1)-ganglioside enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (G(M1)-ELISA). Based on the ELISA results, LTB-COE fusion protein made up about 0.026∼0.048% of the total soluble protein in the transgenic lettuce leaf tissues. The synthesis and assembly of LTB-COE monomers into biologically active oligomers in transgenic lettuce leaf tissues demonstrates the feasibility of using uncooked edible plant-based vaccines for mucosal immunization.","Huy, Nguyen-Xuan; Kim, Young-Sook; Jun, Sang-Chel; Jin, Zhewu; Park, Seung-Moon; Yang, Moon-Sik; Kim, Tae-Geum",Biotechnol Bioprocess Eng,87,1

In many instances, it is of practical importance to evaluate time-dependent variations in the transmission potential of infectious diseases. Explanation of the time course of an epidemic can be partly achieved by estimating the effective reproduction number, R(t), defined as the actual average number of secondary cases per primary case at calendar time t (for t >0). R(t) shows time-dependent variation due to the decline in susceptible individuals (intrinsic factors) and the implementation of control measures (extrinsic factors). If R(t)<1, it suggests that the epidemic is in decline and may be regarded as being under control at time t (vice versa, if R(t)>1).

Der Engländer R. Hooke (1635–1703) führte Untersuchungen von Pflanzengewebe mithilfe eines relativ einfachen Gerätes durch. Das Korkgewebe erschien ihm als eine Aneinanderreihung von Kästen, die er als „Zellen“ bezeichnete (Abb. 1.1). Der Holländer A. van Leeuwenhoeck (1632–1723) entwickelte etwas später das erste Mikroskop. Es handelte sich um eine einfache Anordnung von schmalen Lupen, die zusammen mit dem Objekt vor dem Auge platziert wurden. Leeuwenhoeck konnte auf diese Weise eine Vergrößerung auf das 200-Fache erreichen. Er führte zahlreiche Beobachtungen und Beschreibungen einzelliger Organismen wie Protozoen und Bakterien durch. Erst viel später kam mit den Zoologen und Botanikern T. Schwann (1810–1882) und M. Schleiden (1804–1881) die Theorie von der Zelle auf. Sie bestätigten, dass alle Lebewesen, auch die hoch Entwickelten, aus Zellen und deren Zellprodukten aufgebaut sind. R. Virchow (1821–1902) ergänzte diese Theorie 1855 durch eine zweite Behauptung: Omnis cellula e cellula – „Jede Zelle entsteht aus einer anderen Zelle“.","Boujard, Daniel; Anselme, Bruno; Cullin, Christophe; Raguénès-Nicol, Céline",Zell- und Molekularbiologie im &#x000dc;berblick,87,17

Cell lysis occurred 24 h post-infection and was shown by a decreased neutral red uptake. UV inactivation of the influenza virus, or the addition of anti-influenza antibodies suppressed the virus-induced macrophage lysis. Inversely, pretreatment of swine alveolar macrophages by a phagocytosis inhibitor, namely cytochalasin B, increased the cell susceptibility to virus-induced lysis. The present in vitro studies support the hypothesis that defects in pulmonary antibacterial mechanisms associated with influenza infections are partly due to a direct toxic effect of the virus on alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, the studies show that virus-induced macrophage lysis is influenced by specific humoral immune responses and by modifications in microfilament cell functions.","Charley, B.",Ann Inst Pasteur Virol,87,1

Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein continues to be transported to the surface of monensin-treated cells, is cleaved into HA(1) and HA(2) and is incorporated into budding influenza virus particles. On the other hand, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein appears to accumulate in the membranes of the dilated Golgi apparatus of monensin-treated cells.

We have examined acclimation by comparing changes in the leaf content of RuBP carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) with changes in the transcripts of Rubisco subunit genes and with leaf carbohydrate metabolism. When grown at 1000 mm(3) dm(–3) CO(2), 12 of 16 crop species at peak vegetative growth had a 15–44% decrease in leaf Rubisco protein, but with no specific association with changes in transcript levels measured at midday. Species with only modest reductions in Rubisco content (10–20%) often had a large reduction in Rubisco small subunit gene mRNAs (> 30%), with no reduction in large subunit gene mRNAs. However, species with a very large reduction in Rubisco content generally had only small reductions in transcript mRNAs. Photosynthetic acclimation also was not specifically associated with a change in the level of any particular carbohydrate measured at midday. However, a threshold relationship was found between the reduction in Rubisco content at high CO(2) and absolute levels of soluble acid invertase activity measured in plants grown at ambient or high CO(2). This relationship was valid for 15 of the 16 species examined. There also occurred a similar, albeit less robust, threshold relationship between the leaf hexose/sucrose ratio at high CO(2) and a reduced photosynthetic capacity ≥ 20%. These data indicate that carbohydrate repression of photosynthetic gene expression at elevated CO(2) may involve leaf sucrose cycling through acid invertase and hexokinase.","Moore, B.

Data on the inactivation of enveloped viruses by S/D treatment collected from seven Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association member companies demonstrate the robustness, reliability, and efficacy of this virus inactivation method. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The results from 308 studies reflecting production conditions as well as technical variables significantly beyond the product release specification were evaluated for virus inactivation, comprising different combinations of solvent and detergent (tri(n‐butyl) phosphate [TNBP]/Tween 80, TNBP/Triton X‐100, TNBP/Na‐cholate) and different products (Factor [F]VIII, F IX, and intravenous and intramuscular immunoglobulins). RESULTS: Neither product class, process temperature, protein concentration, nor pH value has a significant impact on virus inactivation. A variable that did appear to be critical was the concentration of solvent and detergent. CONCLUSION: The data presented here demonstrate the robustness of virus inactivation by S/D treatment for a broad spectrum of enveloped test viruses and process variables. Our data substantiate the fact that no transmission of viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or of other enveloped viruses was reported for licensed plasma derivatives since the introduction of S/D treatment.","Dichtelmüller, Herbert O.; Biesert, Lothar; Fabbrizzi, Fabrizio; Gajardo, Rodrigo; Gröner, Albrecht; von Hoegen, Ilka; Jorquera, Juan I.; Kempf, Christoph; Kreil, Thomas R.; Pifat, Dominique; Osheroff, Wendy; Poelsler, Gerhard",Transfusion,87,1

However, previous works do not consider controlling information flow, which makes them hard to obtain useful latent information and limits model performance. Specifically, as human beings, predictions are usually made in multiple steps with every step filtering out irrelevant information and targeting at helpful information. In this paper, we first integrate iterative mechanism into knowledge graph embedding and propose a multi-step gated model which utilizes relations as queries to extract useful information from coarse to fine in multiple steps. First gate mechanism is adopted to control information flow by the interaction between entity and relation with multiple steps. Then we repeat the gate cell for several times to refine the information incrementally. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on most benchmark datasets compared to strong baselines. Further analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and its scalability on large knowledge graphs.","Tan, Chunyang; Yang, Kaijia; Dai, Xinyu; Huang, Shujian; Chen, Jiajun",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,87,1

The static (static polymer–polymer correlation length (mesh size), associates of cross-links and PVP microchains) and dynamic (polymer chain relaxation rate, hydrodynamic polymer–polymer correlation length) structural elements were determined. The incorporation of titania nanoparticles into PVP hydrogel slightly increases the size of structural inhomogeneities (an increase in the static and dynamic polymer–polymer correlation length, the formation of associates of cross-links and PVP chains). Titania nanoparticles have an impact on the microstructure of the composite hydrogel and form associates with sizes from 0.5 to 2 µm attached to PVP hydrogel pore walls. The PVP and TN/PVP hydrogels show a high degree of water swelling. Moreover, the presence of titania nanoparticles in TN/PVP increases the number of water adsorption cycles compared to PVP hydrogel.

While following links may result in the discovery of complementary data sources and enriched query results, it is widely recognized that traversing the LOD Cloud indiscriminately results in low quality answers. Over the years, approaches have been published that help to determine whether links are trustworthy or not, based on certain criteria. While such approaches are often useful for specific datasets and/or in specific applications, they are not yet widely used in practice or at the scale of the entire LOD Cloud. This paper introduces a new resource called MetaLink. MetaLink is a dataset that contains metadata for a very large set of owl:sameAs links that are crawled from the LOD Cloud. MetaLink encodes a previously published error metric for each of these links. MetaLink is published in combination with LOD-a-lot, a dataset that is based on a large crawl of a subset of the LOD Cloud. By combining MetaLink and LOD-a-lot, applications are able to make informed decisions about whether or not to follow specific links on the LOD Cloud. This paper describes our approach for creating the MetaLink dataset.

Recent developments show a precedential growth in the need-perspective of the AI industry, thereby influencing governance and corporate operations and their legal side in cross-cultural avenues. The determinant outlining of artificial intelligence as a legal personality rests on its probabilistic nature, which yet can be limited to the jurisprudential scope of AI-based on the ethos of the utilitarian approach involving the anthropocentric innovations for artificial intelligence. The dynamic nature of AI, however, in the proposition, is capable of a full-fledged and anthropomorphic legal representation and interpretation, which is hard to find in D9 and certain developing countries, which poses special risks to the generic legal infrastructure of a democratic polity to understand the dynamic and self-transformative nature of artificial intelligence in the age of globalization. The paper is thus based on the proposition that the ethos involving the legal infrastructure and persona of artificial intelligence is traceable and easier in deterministic mechanisms by regarding and extending stable & constitutive approaches to dissect the legal challenges connected with the redemptions implicated with the lack of a full-fledged regard and scope of the legal personality of AI. The approaches in due proposition are (a) anthropomorphisation; (b) naturalization; (c) techno-socialization; and (d) enculturation. Further, the paper analyses on the challenges to determine the problematic implications awaited by the influence of populism, protectionism, data-centred digital colonialism and technology distancing and proposes suggestions based on the four approaches to counter the minimal effects of the implications. The conclusions of the paper rest on the argument that in the case of a post-liberal order, the ethos of AI can be protected and diversified by adapting with the appreciation of the ethos of globalization, giving adequate, constitutive and reasonable space to the identity-led implications of national identity & diluting the monopolistic influence of the utilitarian approach to artificial intelligence.",Abhivardhan,Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,87,1

MPI_Allreduce() bandwidth measured on an HDR InfiniBand based system achieves about 95% of network bandwidth. For medium and large data reduction this also improves the reduction bandwidth by a factor of 2–5 relative to host-based (e.g., software-based) reduction algorithms.

Parallel RA implementations can thus play a significant role in extracting parallelism inherent in a wide variety of analytic problems. In general, bottom-up logical inference can be implemented as fixed-point iteration over RA kernels; relations dynamically accumulate new tuples of information according to a set of rules until no new tuples can be discovered from previously inferred tuples and relevant rules (RA kernels). While this strategy has been quite successful in single-node contexts, it poses unique challenges when distributed over many-node, networked clusters—especially regarding how the work-load is balanced across available compute resources. In this paper, we identify two fundamental kinds of load imbalance and present a strategy to address each. We investigate both spatial load imbalance—imbalance across each relation (across compute nodes)—and temporal load imbalance–imbalance in tuples produced across fixed-point iterations. For spatial balancing, we implement refinement and consolidation procedures. For temporal balancing, we implement a technique that permits the residual workload from a busy iteration to roll over to a new iteration. In sum, these techniques permit fully dynamic load-balancing of relational algebra that is robust to changes across time.","Kumar, Sidharth; Gilray, Thomas",High Performance Computing,87,1

Numerous features and configuration options in the hardware and the software environment that are relevant for performance are not even known to most application users or developers. Microbenchmarks, i.e., simple codes that fathom a particular aspect of the hardware, can help to shed light on such issues, but only if they are well understood and if the results can be reconciled with known facts or performance models. The insight gained from microbenchmarks may then be applied to real applications for performance analysis or optimization. In this paper we investigate two modern Intel x86 server CPU architectures in depth: Broadwell EP and Cascade Lake SP. We highlight relevant hardware configuration settings that can have a decisive impact on code performance and show how to properly measure on-chip and off-chip data transfer bandwidths. The new victim L3 cache of Cascade Lake and its advanced replacement policy receive due attention. Finally we use DGEMM, sparse matrix-vector multiplication, and the HPCG benchmark to make a connection to relevant application scenarios.","Alappat, Christie L.; Hofmann, Johannes; Hager, Georg; Fehske, Holger; Bishop, Alan R.; Wellein, Gerhard",High Performance Computing,87,1

As host graphs, we take the Chimera graph and the Pegasus graph, which are the topology graphs of D-Wave’s 2000 qubit (first introduced in 2017) and 5000 qubit (expected 2020) quantum annealer devices, respectively. We evaluate our algorithms on a large set of random graph QUBO inputs (Erdős-Rényi [Formula: see text], Barabási-Albert and d-regular graphs) on both host topologies against other embedding algorithms. For the Pegasus topology, we find that CLMM outperforms all other algorithms at edge densities larger than 0.08, while SPMM wins at edge densities smaller than 0.08 for Erdős-Rényi graphs, with very similar transition densities for the other graph classes. Surprisingly, the standard D-Wave MinorMiner embedding algorithm – while also getting slightly outperformed by SPMM for sparse and very dense graphs on Chimera – does not manage to extend its overall good performance on Chimera to Pegasus as it fails to embed even medium-density graphs on 175–180 nodes which are known to have clique embeddings on Pegasus.","Zbinden, Stefanie; Bärtschi, Andreas; Djidjev, Hristo; Eidenbenz, Stephan",High Performance Computing,87,1

Currently, there are no vaccines approved to prevent campylobacteriosis, and rehydration is the main form of therapy. Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) is the main antibody class found in mucous secretions, including human milk, and serves as the first line of defense for the gastrointestinal epithelium against enteric pathogens. In this study, we describe the prophylactic activity of orally delivered recombinant SIgA generated from two human monoclonal antibodies (CAA1 and CCG4) isolated for their reactivity against the flagellar-capping protein FliD, which is essential for bacteria motility and highly conserved across Campylobacter species associated with severe enteritis. In an immunocompetent weaned mouse model, a single oral administration of FliD-reactive SIgA CAA1 or CCG4 at 2 h before infection significantly enhances Campylobacter clearance at early stages post-infection, reducing the levels of inflammation markers associated with epithelial damage and polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells infiltration in the cecum lamina propria. Our data indicate that the prophylactic activity of CAA1 and CCG4 is not only dependent on the specificity to FliD but also on the use of the SIgA format, as the immunoglobulin G (IgG) versions of the same antibodies did not confer a comparable protective effect. Our work emphasizes the potential of FliD as a target for the development of vaccines and supports the concept that orally administered FliD-reactive SIgA can be developed to prevent or mitigate the severity of Campylobacter infections as well as the development of post-infection syndromes.","Perruzza, Lisa; Jaconi, Stefano; Lombardo, Gloria; Pinna, Debora; Strati, Francesco; Morone, Diego; Seehusen, Frauke; Hu, Yue; Bajoria, Sakshi; Xiong, Jian; Kumru, Ozan Selahattin; Joshi, Sangeeta Bagai; Volkin, David Bernard; Piantanida, Renato; Benigni, Fabio; Grassi, Fabio; Corti, Davide; Pizzuto, Matteo Samuele",Front Immunol,87,33

The GMsFEM allows solving multiscale problems at a reduced computational cost by constructing a reduced-order representation of the solution on a coarse grid. In [14], it was shown that the GMsFEM provides a flexible tool to solve multiscale problems by constructing appropriate snapshot, offline and online spaces. In this paper, we solve a time dependent problem, where online enrichment is used. The main contribution is comparing different online enrichment methods.

We show that ASNP has a complexity dichotomy if and only if the infinite-domain dichotomy conjecture holds for constraint satisfaction problems for first-order reducts of binary finitely bounded homogeneous structures. For such CSPs, powerful universal-algebraic hardness conditions are known that are conjectured to describe the border between NP-hard and polynomial-time tractable CSPs. The connection to CSPs also implies that every ASNP sentence can be evaluated in polynomial time on classes of finite structures of bounded treewidth. We show that the syntax of ASNP is decidable.

For non-Boolean alphabets and for any network size, there are intrinsically non-sequential transformations (i.e. that can not be obtained as composition of sequential updates of some network). Moreover there is no universal automaton network that can produce all non-bijective functions via compositions of asynchronous updates. On the other hand, we show that there are universal automata networks for sequential updates if one is allowed to use a larger alphabet and then use either projection onto or restriction to the original alphabet. We also characterize the set of functions that are generated by non-bijective sequential updates.

Recently, Veanes et al. showed the usefulness of monadic decomposability in the context of SMT (i.e. the input formula is quantifier-free), and found various interesting applications including string analysis. However, checking monadic decomposability is undecidable in general. Decidability for certain theories is known (e.g. Presburger Arithmetic, Tarski’s Real-Closed Field), but there are very few results regarding their computational complexity. In this paper, we study monadic decomposability of integer linear arithmetic in the setting of SMT. We show that this decision problem is coNP-complete and, when monadically decomposable, a formula admits a decomposition of exponential size in the worst case. We provide a new application of our results to string constraint solving with length constraints. We then extend our results to variadic decomposability, where predicates could admit multiple free variables (in contrast to monadic decomposability).

Here, we present the synthesis and efficacy study of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)-based Ag/ZnO/TiO(2) trimetallic bifunctional nanofibers with antibacterial and photocatalytic activity. The nanofibers have been proven to be effective for the degradation of methylene blue (MB 93.4%), rhodamine B (Rh 34.6%), auramine-O (Au 65.0%) and fuchsin basic (FB 69.8%) dyes individually within 90 min in daylight. The study is further extended in abating a mixture of these dyes from contaminated water using composite nanofibers. Also, in the case of a mixture of these dyes (3 ppm each), nanofibers show dye degradation efficiency (DDE) of 90.9% (MB), 62.4% (Au) and 90.3% (FB and Rh) in 60 min. The role of Ag nanoparticles with a synergic photocatalytic effect on ZnO and TiO(2) is also demonstrated. Also, PMMA/ZnO/TiO(2) composite fiber membrane in synergy with silver particles shows better antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria E. coli, making PMMA/Ag/ZnO/TiO(2) fibers a promising candidate in water purification.

The results suggest that the total number of calls for mental health issues was at the lowest level when compared with the same time period for the previous 3 years. Furthermore, as both the daily reported COVID-19 cases and related deaths increased over time, there was a significant decline in both suicide threats and suicides in progress. Significant hot spots were found for the total calls as well as for threats of suicide. These hot spots did not coincide with the spatial distribution of reported cases of COVID-19 by ZIP code. While higher and lower areas of reported cases were found, these differences by ZIP code were not found to be significant. When compared with the previous 3 years of data, the hot spot area was much smaller in 2020, implying that the mental health-related calls for service were more evenly spread throughout the city.","Lersch, Kim M",,87,1

The kernel of Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivative has many features such as non-singularity, non-locality and an exponential form. Therefore, it is preferred for modeling disease spreading systems. In this work, we suggest to formulate COVID-19 epidemic transmission via [Formula: see text] paradigm using the Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivation method. In the suggested fractional order COVID-19 [Formula: see text] paradigm, the impact of changing quarantining and contact rates are examined. The stability of the proposed fractional order COVID-19 [Formula: see text] paradigm is studied and a parametric rule for the fundamental reproduction number formula is given. The existence and uniqueness of stable solution of the proposed fractional order COVID-19 [Formula: see text] paradigm are proved. Since the genetic algorithm is a common powerful optimization method, we propose an optimum control strategy based on the genetic algorithm. By this strategy, the peak values of the infected population classes are to be minimized.

While the evolution of HIV prevention options has become increasingly biomedical, inequities in access and uptake of these modalities persist. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies suggest that while YBMSM display interest and acceptability of varied HIV prevention options, uptake lags due to the lingering effects of intersectional oppression from racism and sexual prejudice, HIV stigma, institutional and provider bias, and unresolved health policy barriers. Promising avenues to address these barriers have yet to be fully explored. SUMMARY: We have the tools to effectively prevent HIV transmission and acquisition among YBMSM, but we have not yet effectively implemented these tools for this priority population. To end the epidemic, we must tailor and adapt HIV prevention strategies to meet the unique intersecting needs, identities, and social contexts of YBMSM.","Fields, Errol L.; Hussen, Sophia A.; Malebranche, David J.",Curr HIV/AIDS Rep,87,1

Although syndromic surveillance has gained wide acceptance as a response to disease outbreaks and bioterrorism attacks, many research challenges remain. First, there are circumstances in which syndromic surveillance may not be effective or necessary. The potential benefit of syndromic surveillance as to the timeliness of detection could not be realized if there were hundreds or thousands of people infected simultaneously. In extreme cases, modern biological weapons could easily lead to mass infection via airborne or waterborne agents. In another scenario, syndromic surveillance could be rendered ineffective if the cases involved only a few people (e.g., the anthrax outbreak in 2001) and thus would not trigger any alarms and could go undetected (2005b). In this situation, one single positive diagnosis of a spore of anthrax could be sufficient to confirm the event.","Chen, Hsinchun; Zeng, Daniel; Yan, Ping",Infectious Disease Informatics,87,1

Burris will present on how although initial control efforts took the form of travel restrictions, quarantine and isolation, sustained human-to-human community transmission of COVID-19 in the United States pushed authorities to move from these traditional tools to the challenge of promoting social distancing behavior and managing a surge in demand for health care. These challenges posed new and urgent questions of practical regulation and distributive justice as underlying social disparities created differing levels of vulnerability. This presentation reviews the first six months of the response in the US from a legal and social justice standpoint, focusing on issues of equity. Fafard will analyze the communications role of senior public health officials during the COVID-19 outbreak in five countries; their public messaging across a range of media platforms, including how they deal with misinformation; and the extent to which members of the public receive, understand, and trust this messaging. Kavanagh will discuss how relative democratic and autocratic political institutions have influenced early responses to the novel coronavirus outbreak. Using evidence from process tracing in China, Iran, the United States, South Korea, and Italy, this presentation evaluates the hypothesis advanced or implied by many global public health officials that authoritarian governments have an advantage in disease response Peralta will discuss how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic highlighted the heterogeneity in the measured used for containment and mitigation by governments. Where authoritarian states, that theoretically have more policy options for containment and mitigation, have an advantage in an epidemic event remains unclear. This presentation will compare measures taken by governments and health authorities in five selected authoritarian states and five democracies and evaluate the capacity of epidemic containment. Willison will highlight how political elites in the United States define public health threats; how partisanship and party competition define public health responses, including expenditure and coordination; and how party and media elites draw on established tensions in American politics to frame outbreaks in ways advantageous to the parties. KEY MESSAGES: We will focus on similarities and differences in responses to COVID-19 around the world, highlight effective measures, and reflect on lessons learned in the first few months of this novel coronavirus.

In light of the recent outbreak (Italy is in 2nd position), it is important to evaluate people risk perception and to support the Health Authority with effective communicative actions to avoid the spread of “infodemia”/alarmism. The aim of this study is a) to study levels of perceived threat, risk perception, severity and comparative vulnerability b) to compare risk perception with other communicable/not communicable diseases; c) provide information to increase awareness/ knowledge of the disease. METHODS: We performed an Italian multicentre study from 11 February 2020 and it is still in progress. The subjects in study (general population, HCWs and university students) were enrolled through the administration of a standardized questionnaire based on Health Belief Model through CAPI and CAWI methods. The summary and inferential statistical analyses will be carried out using the R software. RESULTS: We enrolled 2495 people from 11 February until 4 March 2020. All the respondents had heard of COVID19. Only 2% didn't know any symptoms and 3% answered to all the questions correctly (mean knowledge score of 13). 48% thought that he/she could acquired COVID 19 in the next 12 months and 70% stated that their concern of the disease was high(score5). Perceived capability to avoid it was rated as good/very good by 62%. The correct mask use (WHO) was reported by 64% of the sample and 47% stated all preventive actions (2% no one). Only 22% of the sample stated all actions to be taken in case of suspected acquisition of COVID19. CONCLUSIONS: Italy is facing an epidemic that could have the potential to affect the entire national health system. It's so important to implement public health activities and surveillance systems in order to limit the spread of the disease and bad/disinformation. KEY MESSAGES: This study is the first to report on public perception of Sars-Cov-2 in all the Italy. The results indicated that the Italian population is aware of the outbreak and it is concerned about their risk. On the other hand, only half of the sample is aware about all preventive actions and not everybody knows all procedures to be taken in case of COVID 19 suspect.","Genovese, C; Signorelli, C; Pavia, M; Icardi, G; Mistretta, A; Casuccio, A; Villari, P; Pellissero, G; Siliquini, R; Squeri, R",Eur J Public Health,87,0

Is it of support also in difficult times? Does pressure amplify its positive aspects or rather the dysfunctional ones? This case report addresses a nursing division within a university hospital, particularly its leadership culture that was recently “stress tested” by the COVID-19 pandemic. To the relief of those involved, the situation revealed a solid foundation and the positive force of a division-wide culture of shared leadership. Our contribution to this special issue of the journal Gruppe. Interaktion. Organisation. (GIO) reflects upon a leadership development process of five years, which supported the emergence of an adaptive and community-oriented leadership practice capable of constructively coping with complexity, permanent change and various tensions. Core elements of this process were regular large group workshops that provided spaces for resonance, reflection and experimentation and fostered the building of trust and connectedness. We first recapitulate significant steps and contents of this process and then examine impact factors and determinants of success by drawing on interviews with participating leaders. This is followed by an engagement with theoretical perspectives on questions of meaning in relation to leadership and a consideration and discussion of the case example against this background. In that we focus on such approaches that look at meaning phenomena as transsubjective and collective and our article advocates against considering meaning detached from the communities in which it emerges. We conclude with a résumé and outlook in view of a reorganization in the context of this case study.","Kleinhuber, Andrea; Hermann, Anja",Gr Interakt Org,87,1

The objective of this study was to detect the validity of serial measurements of arterial lactate level in differentiating hospital mortality and neurological outcome after VA-ECMO support for adult patients with cardiogenic shock. All consecutive patients ≥ 18 years admitted with cardiogenic shock and supported with VA-ECMO between 2015 and 2019 in our tertiary care hospital were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: The study included 106 patients with a mean age of 40.2 ± 14.4 years, a mean BMI of 26.5 ± 7 and mostly males (69.8%). The in-hospital mortality occurred in 56.6% and acute cerebral strokes occurred in 25.5% of the enrolled patients. The non-survivors and the patients with acute cerebral strokes had significantly higher arterial lactate levels at pre-ECMO initiation, post-ECMO peak and after 24 h of ECMO support compared to the survivors and those without strokes, respectively. The peak arterial lactate ≥ 14.65 mmol/L measured after ECMO support had 81.7% sensitivity and 89.1% specificity for predicting hospital mortality [AUROC 0.889, p < 0.001], while the arterial lactate level ≥ 3.25 mmol/L after 24 h of ECMO support had 88.3% sensitivity and 97.8% specificity for predicting hospital mortality [AUROC 0.93, p < 0.001]. The peak lactate ≥ 15.15 mmol/L measured after ECMO support had 70.8% sensitivity and 69% specificity for predicting cerebral strokes [AUROC 0.717, p < 0.001], while the lactate level ≥ 3.25 mmol/L after 24 h of ECMO support had 79.2% sensitivity and 72.4% specificity for predicting cerebral strokes [AUROC 0.779, p < 0.001]. Progressive hyperlactatemia (OR = 1.427, 95% CI 1.048–1.944, p = 0.024) and increasing SOFA score after 48 h (OR = 1.819, 95% CI 1.374–2.409, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality after VA-ECMO support. Post hoc analysis detected a significantly high frequency of hypoalbuminemia in the non-survivors and in the patients who developed acute cerebral strokes during VA-ECMO support. CONCLUSION: Progressive hyperlactatemia after VA-ECMO initiation for adult patients with cardiogenic shock is a sensitive and specific predictor of hospital mortality and acute cerebrovascular strokes. According to our results, we could recommend early VA-ECMO initiation to achieve adequate circulatory support and better outcome.","Laimoud, Mohamed; Alanazi, Mosleh",Egypt Heart J,87,16

Acute viral bronchiolitis (AVB) remains one of the leading causes of admission to PICU. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of AVB. We aimed to evaluate the incidence of PARDS in AVB and identify the risk of RSV as a trigger pathogen for PARDS. This study is a retrospective single-center observational cohort study including children < 2 years of age admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit at St Mary’s Hospital, London, and presented with AVB in 3 years (2016–2018). Clinical and demographic data was collected; PALICC criteria were applied to define PARDS. Data was expressed as median (IQR range); non-parametric tests were used. In this study, 144 infants with acute viral bronchiolitis were admitted to PICU in the study period. Thirty-nine infants fulfilled criteria of PARDS with RSV as the most common virus identified. Bacterial infection was identified as a risk factor for development of PARDS in infants with AVB. Conclusion: AVB is an important cause of PARDS in infants. RSV is associated with a higher risk of PARDS in AVB. Bacterial co-infection is a significant risk factor for development of PARDS in AVB.

A key principle of the Global Fund is country ownership in accessing funding through “engagement of in-country stakeholders, including key and vulnerable populations, communities, and civil society.” Research documenting whether diverse stakeholders are actually engaged and on how stakeholder engagement affects processes and outcomes of grant applications is limited. OBJECTIVE: To examine representation during the 2017 Global Fund application process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Uganda and the benefits and drawbacks of partnership to the process. METHODS: We developed a mixed-methods social network survey to measure network structure and assess perceptions of how working together in partnership with other individuals/organizations affected perceived effectiveness, efficiency, and country ownership of the application process. Surveys were administered from December 2017–May 2018, initially to a set of central actors, followed by any individuals named during the surveys (up to 10) as collaborators. Network analyses were conducted using R. FINDINGS: Collaborators spanning many organizations and expertise areas contributed to the 2017 applications (DRC: 152 nodes, 237 ties; Uganda: 118 nodes, 241 ties). Participation from NGOs and civil society representatives was relatively strong, with most of their ties being to different organization types, Uganda (63%), and DRC (67%), highlighting their collaborative efforts across the network. Overall, the perceived benefits of partnership were high, including very strong ratings for effectiveness in both countries. Perceived drawbacks of partnership were minimal; however, less than half of respondents thought partnership helped reduce transaction costs or financial costs, suggesting an inclusive and participatory process may come with short-term efficiency tradeoffs. CONCLUSIONS: Social network analysis can be useful for identifying who is included and excluded from the process, which can support efforts to ensure stronger, more meaningful engagement in future Global Fund application processes.","Shelley, Katharine D.; Kamya, Carol; Mpanya, Godefroid; Mulongo, Salva; Nagasha, Shakilah N.; Beylerian, Emily; Duber, Herbert C.; Hernandez, Bernardo; Osterman, Allison; Phillips, David E.; Shearer, Jessica C.",,87,1

Applying the Energy Mix Concentration Index method (a modified version of the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index), this study examined energy diversification and transition trends in Africa’s top ten economies over an 18-year period, from 2000 to 2017. Data were obtained in July 2020 from the African Union Energy Commission’s data portal. Overall, energy diversification was found to be occurring at a very slow pace. Kenya and Morocco emerged as the two most energy diversified countries (with indices of 0.34 and 0.37, respectively), while Algeria (0.98) and Ethiopia (0.87) were the least diversified countries as at 2017. The energy transition trend is consistent with the multiple fuel use/energy stacking model rather than the energy ladder hypothesis. “Balance” (the share of each energy source in the energy mix) was found to significantly influence energy diversification. Contrary to past assertions, this study finds that higher “variety” (the number of energy sources in the energy mix) does not signify greater diversity. A weak negative linear relationship was found between gross domestic product growth and Energy Mix Concentration Indices for most countries, suggesting that as gross domestic product grows, the energy mix becomes more diversified. However, this relationship was statistically insignificant. Policy makers need to increase investments in renewable energies, and diversify their economies (especially in oil-dependent countries) to facilitate energy diversification and sustainable energy transitions.

In patients with COVID 19 infection, the presence of frailty may place older adults at higher risk for poor clinical outcomes including hospitalizations and mortality. The aim of this case-series study was to describe the characteristics of patients with frailty and COVID-19 who were hospitalized at a VA Medical Center. A VA Frailty Index (VA-FI) was generated at baseline as a proportion of variables from electronic health records. The VA-FI categorized Veterans into non-frail (FI<.21) and frail (FI≥.21). We calculated the VA-FI for Veterans admitted at the time of COVID-19 admission date. We compared the characteristics of frail and non-frail Veterans. A total of 137 veterans were admitted, 96.3% (n=132) were male, mean age 66.81 (SD=13.87) years, and 65.7% (n=90) were frail. When comparing Veterans who were frail versus non-frail, there were no differences in age, race, ethnicity, BMI, rates of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, ICU admissions, use of vasopressors or length of stay. There were significant differences in rates of intubation (frail n=10, vs. non-frail n=0), p = 0.018 and non-invasive respiratory support (frail n=9 vs non-frail n=0), p=.025. There were 13 and 7 readmissions in the frail and non-frail groups respectively. Eleven Veterans died during hospitalization, all of whom were frail. Frailty is associated with poor clinical outcomes in hospitalized Veterans with COVID 19 infection. Recognition of frailty may help to optimize the management of COVID 19 related complications.","Fernandez, Marlena; Hart, Valerie; Diaz, Alma; Burton, Lorena; Cevallos, Victor; Ruiz, Jorge",Innov Aging,87,1

Despite the approval of the first malaria vaccine Mosquirix™ and very promising data using cryopreserved P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ), further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of humoral immunity for the development of next-generation vaccines and alternative malaria therapies including antibody therapy. A high prevalence of antibodies against AMA1 in immune individuals has made this antigen one of the major blood-stage vaccine candidates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using antibody phage display, an AMA1-specific growth inhibitory human monoclonal antibody from a malaria-immune Fab library using a set of three AMA1 diversity covering variants (DiCo 1–3), which represents a wide range of AMA1 antigen sequences, was selected. The functionality of the selected clone was tested in vitro using a growth inhibition assay with P. falciparum strain 3D7. To potentially improve affinity and functional activity of the isolated antibody, a phage display mediated light chain shuffling was employed. The parental light chain was replaced with a light chain repertoire derived from the same population of human V genes, these selected antibodies were tested in binding tests and in functionality assays. RESULTS: The selected parental antibody achieved a 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of 1.25 mg/mL. The subsequent light chain shuffling led to the generation of four derivatives of the parental clone with higher expression levels, similar or increased affinity and improved EC(50) against 3D7 of 0.29 mg/mL. Pairwise epitope mapping gave evidence for binding to AMA1 domain II without competing with RON2. CONCLUSION: We have thus shown that a compact immune human phage display library is sufficient for the isolation of potent inhibitory monoclonal antibodies and that minor sequence mutations dramatically increase expression levels in Nicotiana benthamiana. Interestingly, the antibody blocks parasite inhibition independently of binding to RON2, thus having a yet undescribed mode of action.","Seidel-Greven, Melanie; Addai-Mensah, Otchere; Spiegel, Holger; Chiegoua Dipah, Gwladys Nina; Schmitz, Stefan; Breuer, Gudrun; Frempong, Margaret; Reimann, Andreas; Klockenbring, Torsten; Fischer, Rainer; Barth, Stefan; Fendel, Rolf",Malar J,87,1

For the same, literature has witnessed that medical imaging plays a vital role, and tools using supervised methods have promising results. However, the limited size of medical images for diagnosis of CoVID19 may impact the generalization of such supervised methods. To alleviate this, a new clustering method is presented. In this method, a novel variant of a gravitational search algorithm is employed for obtaining optimal clusters. To validate the performance of the proposed variant, a comparative analysis among recent metaheuristic algorithms is conducted. The experimental study includes two sets of benchmark functions, namely standard functions and CEC2013 functions, belonging to different categories such as unimodal, multimodal, and unconstrained optimization functions. The performance comparison is evaluated and statistically validated in terms of mean fitness value, Friedman test, and box-plot. Further, the presented clustering method tested against three different types of publicly available CoVID19 medical images, namely X-ray, CT scan, and Ultrasound images. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is comparatively outperforming in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score.","Mittal, Himanshu; Pandey, Avinash Chandra; Pal, Raju; Tripathi, Ashish",Appl Intell,87,20

While C. hominis only infects humans, C. parvum is a zoonotic parasite that can be transmitted from infected animals to humans. There are no treatment or control measures to fully treat cryptosporidiosis or prevent the infection in humans and animals. Our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of Cryptosporidium-host interactions and the underlying factors that govern infectivity and disease pathogenesis is very limited. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent development of genetics and new animal models of infection, along with progress in cell culture platforms to complete the parasite lifecycle in vitro, is greatly advancing the Cryptosporidium field. SUMMARY: In this review, we will discuss our current knowledge of host-parasite interactions and how genetic manipulation of Cryptosporidium and promising infection models are opening the doors towards an improved understanding of parasite biology and disease pathogenesis.","Pinto, Derek J.; Vinayak, Sumiti",Curr Clin Microbiol Rep,87,24

Affecting everyone, its impact is not equal. Exacerbating deep social fissures and long-standing systemic inequalities, the pandemic reveals the fragilities and inequities in global higher education. Accelerating underlying trends and triggering seismic shifts in the sector, collective efforts over a period of weeks delivered massive change in a sector not known for being fleet-of-foot. As we envisage the ‘next normal’ for higher education, problems with the ‘old normal’ may be fixed and some recent innovations carried forward. Representing a period of punctuated equilibrium, COVID-19 could lead to transformation of the sector towards greater equity and impact across teaching/learning, research/innovation, community service/engagement and the staff/students’ experience. As we ask, “When will HE open again?”, and “When we do, what will it be like?” we may also find ourselves considering “Will some institutions open at all?” Seeking to navigate these volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous times—so-called VUCA conditions—we propose that the SDGs are positioned as a lens to re-imagine higher education in mounting an antifragility response.

Moreover, there exists a critical level for average degree above which [Formula: see text] increases quicker in the scale-free network than in the random network. To design the effective control strategies for the subpopulations with different activities, we examine the optimal control problem of the heterogeneous model. Numerical studies suggest us no matter what the network is, we should implement control measures as soon as possible once the outbreak takes off, and particularly, the subpopulation with high connectivity should require high intensity of interventions. However, with delayed initiation of controls, relatively strong control measures should be given to groups with medium degrees.

These CEs leverage the semantics of the family in the form of bounds on its best- and worst-case behaviour provided by a deductive oracle using an MDP abstraction. The method further monitors the performance of the synthesis and adaptively switches between inductive and deductive reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that the novel CE construction provides a significantly faster and more effective pruning strategy leading to an accelerated synthesis process on a wide range of benchmarks. For challenging problems, such as the synthesis of decentralized partially-observable controllers, we reduce the run-time from a day to minutes.","Andriushchenko, Roman; Češka, Milan; Junges, Sebastian; Katoen, Joost-Pieter",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,87,10

The recent emergence of feminist foreign policy (FFP) shows it may be possible to institutionalize feminist principles in international relations in ways that challenge the use of ‘national sovereignty’ as an excuse for discrimination against women. But for FFP to deliver a significant course correction in international affairs, its practitioners must accept that ending diplomatic silence on abuses of women has costs.

We also suggest that participation in these trade agreements stimulates greater adoption of CSR standards from state-owned firms than privately owned firms because those agreements increase the accountability of state firms to supranational institutions, whereas private firms are already accountable to their respective state and domestic institutions. Moreover, we argue that the positive effect of trade agreements on the adoption of CSR standards is higher in countries with higher levels of regulatory quality.

Moreover, the indirect effects of leader reward omission on employes’ deviant behavior are mediated by moral disengagement. Our study also reveals that Machiavellianism can aggravate the positive effect of leader reward omission on moral disengagement, and subsequently exacerbate the indirect effect on employes’ deviant behavior.

Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are pathological conditions due to alterations in the musculoskeletal system. TMDs mainly cause temporomandibular joint and masticatory muscle dysfunctions following trauma, along with various pathologies and inflammatory processes. TMD affects approximately 15% of the population and causes malocclusion problems and common symptoms such as myofascial pain and migraine. The aim of this work was to provide a transcriptomic profile of masticatory muscles obtained from TMD migraine patients compared to control. Materials and Methods: We used Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology to evaluate transcriptomes in masseter and temporalis muscle samples. Results: The transcriptomic analysis showed a prevalent downregulation of the genes involved in the myogenesis process. Conclusions: In conclusion, our findings suggest that the muscle regeneration process in TMD migraine patients may be slowed, therefore therapeutic interventions are needed to restore temporomandibular joint function and promote healing processes.","Sindona, Cinzia; Runci Anastasi, Michele; Chiricosta, Luigi; Gugliandolo, Agnese; Silvestro, Serena; Bramanti, Placido; Cascone, Piero; Mazzon, Emanuela",Medicina (Kaunas),87,16

The study aims to define the factors that affect students’ acceptance of a web-based learning management system and test the moderating effect of their academic involvement in the success of a WLMS. 477 valid questionnaires were collected from university/college students to empirically test the research model using the structural equation modelling approach. The results concludes that indirect and direct effects account for 49% of the variation in the intention to use, which is explained by technical system quality, information quality, educational quality, service quality of the technical support team and user satisfaction. High academic involvement moderates the impact of different service qualities of the WLMS on user satisfaction, intention to use the system, and success of the WLMS.

The safety of laparoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic was therefore debated. We aimed to systematically review the literature regarding the safe use of laparoscopy during COVID-19. METHOD: We performed a systematic search using PubMed and ScienceDirect databases from inception to 1st May 2020. The following search terms were used: ‘’laparoscopic surgery and COVID-19’’; ‘’minimally invasive surgery and COVID-19’’. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO register. RESULTS: Altogether, 174 relevant citations were identiﬁed and reviewed for this study, of which 22 articles were included. The analysis of the findings was presented in tabular form. We scrutinized the common recommendations for performing laparoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic in forms of pre-, intra- and postoperative phases. CONCLUSIONS: There is no scientific evidence to date for the transmission of COVID-19 by means of laparoscopic surgery. If safe, conservative management is the primary alternative during the pandemic. If indicated, laparoscopic surgery can be used with precautions because of supplementary benefits compared to open surgery. We concluded that recommended precautions should be respected while performing laparoscopy during the pandemic.","Boghdady, M El; Ewalds-Kvist, B",Br J Surg,87,5

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) accounts for 68% of the infection and contributed 74% of the 1.5 million deaths in 2013 despite having only 12% of the total world population residing in the region. This systematic review has attempted to determine the association between heavy metal toxicity and the occurrence of non-communicable diseases in the HIV/AIDS population. Materials and Methods: Three databases were systematically searched: PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for studies written in English and published between 1 April 2000 and 12 April 2020. Studies were excluded if the main outcomes were not measured or did not meet the inclusion criteria. Results: All the six included studies are cross-sectional in design, and therefore were evaluated using the STROBE checklist. The data extraction was done using an extraction table; the ratio of female to male participants included in the study was 1.09:1. Qualitative analysis was used due to the heterogeneity in the heavy metal biomarkers and the outcome measured by the included studies. Two studies compared the concentration of heavy metals in HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants while one compared the levels between HAART-naïve and HAART-treated participants, and three determined the association between heavy metal toxicity and non-communicable diseases (liver fibrosis, anaemia, and reproductive parameters, respectively) in HIV-positive patients. Conclusions: Blood lead, cadmium, and mercury levels were higher in HIV-seropositive than -seronegative subjects, whereas serum zinc level was lower in HIV-seropositive than -seronegative subjects, but the causal association between heavy metals and non-communicable diseases in HIV subjects is largely unknown. Interdisciplinary research between nutrition, toxicology, and human health is envisaged for primary and secondary prevention and treatment.","Folorunso, Opeyemi M.; Frazzoli, Chiara; Chijioke-Nwauche, Ifeyinwa; Bocca, Beatrice; Orisakwe, Orish E.",Medicina (Kaunas),87,24

We examined reasons for treatment choice and outcomes in ATN and ATE mod-sev UC patients. METHODS: A point-in-time survey of US gastroenterologists and their respective consulting UC patients was conducted from Jan 2020–Feb 2021 (ongoing) using the Adelphi Disease Specific Programme™ for Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Physicians completed patient record forms for UC patients with a history of mod-sev disease covering treatment history and clinical status. Patients were classified as ATN and ATE based on treatment. Response to treatment status was identified by factor and cluster analyses using flare, remission and change in symptoms. Descriptive and comparative statistics were calculated for reasons for initiating/switching therapy and patient-reported outcomes (satisfaction, pain/fatigue, and quality of life via the EuroQol-5 dimension questionnaire [EQ-5D]). RESULTS: Based on the interim sample, 66 physicians and 394 mod-sev UC patients were analysed. Of patients who were ATN (n=82) and ATE (n=312), 29% and 32% were classified as non-responders respectively. Comparing ATN vs ATE patients, mean age was directionally lower (38.4 vs 40.7 years), proportion of males was directionally higher (65% vs 55%), and mean time since diagnosis was similar (3.9 vs 3.8 years). In general, non-responders experienced gastrointestinal-related (90% vs 41%), anorectal (38% vs 6%), and fatigue-related symptoms (66% vs 23%) more frequently than responders. ATN patients eligible to receive AT (n=26) reported dislike of injections/infusions (46%) or unwillingness to go to infusion centres (31%) as reasons for not receiving AT. Most common reasons for switching therapy in ATN patients were disease progression (40%) and lack of tolerability (27%), and in ATE patients were loss of response over time (43%) and disease progression (35%). In the ATE group, patient and physician satisfaction rates were higher in responders vs non-responders (>93% vs <79%), pain and fatigue scores were lower (0.8 vs 2.3 and 1.1 vs 2.3, p<0.0001), and EQ-5D scores higher (0.93 vs 0.81, p=0.005). In the ATN group, comparisons were not conducted due to small sample sizes. CONCLUSION: In this point-in-time survey study with data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic period, about a third of mod-sev UC patients did not respond to current therapy. These results suggest an opportunity for new therapies that increase response rates, provide long-term disease control, provide alternatives to parenteral routes of administration, and enhance patient satisfaction.","Afzali, A; Kakehi, S; Lapensee, K; Lukanova, R; Hennessy, F; Knight, H; Singh, K",J Crohns Colitis,87,1

A dataset of 398 valid COVID‐19 announcements from 50 UK food retailers posted on the social media platform Twitter, and 21,960 consumer comments associated with these announcements, are analysed using content analysis and social media analytics, respectively. In Study 1, we test the effects of corporate crisis response strategy (defensive vs. offensive) and response framing (emotional vs. rational) on consumer E‐WoM (measured as ‘consumer sentiment’). The results reveal that using a defensive corporate response strategy with emotionally framed announcements leads to more positive consumer E‐WoM. In Study 2, we advance the findings of Study 1 using a vignette‐based experimental design to examine how social media announcements made by food retailing brands influence consumers’ trust recovery. We find that consumer trust recovers significantly when corporate COVID‐19 responses are framed in an emotional manner. By drawing upon signalling theory, this study makes an important contribution to public health crisis communication and service failure literature by demystifying consumers’ reactions towards corporate crisis responses amid a pandemic.","Wang, Yichuan; Zhang, Minhao; Li, Shuyang; McLeay, Fraser; Gupta, Suraksha",,87,13

Spermatogenesis starts in the early fetus and completes after puberty, passing through different stages. Male infertility can result from primary or congenital, acquired, or idiopathic causes. The absence of sperm in semen, or azoospermia, results from non-obstructive causes (pretesticular and testicular), and post-testicular obstructive causes. Several medications such as antihypertensive drugs, antidepressants, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy could lead to impaired spermatogenesis and lead to a non-obstructive azoospermia. Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are the basis for spermatogenesis and fertility in men. SSCs are characterized by their capacity to maintain the self-renewal process and differentiation into spermatozoa throughout the male reproductive life and transmit genetic information to the next generation. SSCs originate from gonocytes in the postnatal testis, which originate from long-lived primordial germ cells during embryonic development. The treatment of infertility in males has a poor prognosis. However, SSCs are viewed as a promising alternative for the regeneration of the impaired or damaged spermatogenesis. SSC transplantation is a promising technique for male infertility treatment and restoration of spermatogenesis in the case of degenerative diseases such as cancer, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The process involves isolation of SSCs and cryopreservation from a testicular biopsy before starting cancer treatment, followed by intra-testicular stem cell transplantation. In general, treatment for male infertility, even with SSC transplantation, still has several obstacles. The efficiency of cryopreservation, exclusion of malignant cells contamination in cancer patients, and socio-cultural attitudes remain major challenges to the wider application of SSCs as alternatives. Furthermore, there are limitations in experience and knowledge regarding cryopreservation of SSCs. However, the level of infrastructure or availability of regulatory approval to process and preserve testicular tissue makes them tangible and accurate therapy options for male infertility caused by non-obstructive azoospermia, though in their infancy, at least to date.","Abdelaal, Nesma E.; Tanga, Bereket Molla; Abdelgawad, Mai; Allam, Sahar; Fathi, Mostafa; Saadeldin, Islam M.; Bang, Seonggyu; Cho, Jongki",Cells,87,1

We offer insight into this process by analysing the first two years of Jair Bolsonaro’s (2019-ongoing) environmental policies—namely, how Brazil’s environmental protection arrangements are being dismantled. We find that the Bolsonaro administration centralises environmental governance in Brazil through complementary authoritarian and populist means. First in restricting participatory decision-making spaces such as the National Environmental Council (Conama) and the National Council of the Legal Amazon (CNAL), and, second, by attacking indigenous and traditional peoples, NGOs, scientists, and other environmental defenders. To illustrate the authoritarian dimension of Bolsonaro’s environmental governance, we carry out a political-institutional analysis of contemporary Brazilian environmental politics and then exemplify the ways and extent to which attacks against environmental defenders is a constituent part of Bolsonaro’s environmental populism. We hold that such attacks are not merely rhetorical but a political tactic to legitimise Bolsonaro’s authoritarian environmental governance in the promotion of ‘total extractivism’ while maintaining a populist appeal.","Menezes, Roberto Goulart; Barbosa Jr., Ricardo",Z Vgl Polit Wiss,87,1

To fill the research gap, this article reports the findings of a case study exploring university teachers’ perceptions of and practices with technology as well as the challenges of technology implementation. To provide a microscopic understanding of these issues from teachers’ perspective, an online survey was first distributed to all 60 English teachers at a focal university, with 35 valid surveys returned. Subsequently, nine survey respondents participated in in-depth follow-up interviews. The findings suggest that teachers used technology predominantly for teacher-centred purposes rather than for active student engagement although they had positive perceptions of technology integration. They also held critical viewpoints on the use of technology in English teaching. In addition, teachers perceived more external barriers to technology integration (e.g. insufficient technical and pedagogical training, “the Great Firewall”) than internal challenges (e.g. students’ lack of interest in technology). The study contributes to the understanding of university teachers’ technology uptake and carries important implications for the promotion of teaching innovation and effectiveness in higher education contexts.

Given the central role of symbioses in ecosystem processes, functions, and services throughout the Earth biosphere, the impacts of human-driven change on symbioses are critical to understand. Symbioses are not merely collections of organisms, but co-evolved partners that arise from the synergistic combination and action of different genetic programs. They function with varying degrees of permanence and selection as emergent units with substantial potential for combinatorial and evolutionary innovation in both structure and function. Following an articulation of operational definitions of symbiosis and related concepts and characteristics of the Anthropocene, we outline a basic typology of anthropogenic change (AC) and a conceptual framework for how AC might mechanistically impact symbioses with select case examples to highlight our perspective. We discuss surprising connections between symbiosis and the Anthropocene, suggesting ways in which new symbioses could arise due to AC, how symbioses could be agents of ecosystem change, and how symbioses, broadly defined, of humans and “farmed” organisms may have launched the Anthropocene. We conclude with reflections on the robustness of symbioses to AC and our perspective on the importance of symbioses as ecosystem keystones and the need to tackle anthropogenic challenges as wise and humble stewards embedded within the system.","Hom, Erik F.

This article aims to explore the clinical value of GDF15 in sepsis and to preliminarily explore its prospective regulatory effect on macrophage inflammation and its functions. We recruited 320 subjects (132 cases in sepsis group, 93 cases in nonsepsis group, and 95 cases in control group), then detected the serum GDF15 levels and laboratory indicators, and further investigated the correlation between GDF15 and laboratory indicators, and also analyzed the clinical value of GDF15 in sepsis diagnosis, severity assessment, and prognosis. In vitro, we used LPS to stimulate THP-1 and RAW264.7 cells to establish the inflammatory model, and detected the expression of GDF15 in the culture medium and cells under the inflammatory state. After that, we added GDF15 recombinant protein (rGDF15) pretreatment to explore its prospective regulatory effect on macrophage inflammation and its functions. The results showed that the serum GDF15 levels were significantly increased in the sepsis group, which was correlated with laboratory indexes of organ damage, coagulation indexes, inflammatory factors, and SOFA score. GDF15 also has a high AUC in the diagnosis of sepsis, which can be further improved by combining with other indicators. The dynamic monitoring of GDF15 levels can play an important role in the judgment and prognosis of sepsis. In the inflammatory state, the expression of intracellular and extracellular GDF15 increased. GDF15 can reduce the levels of cytokines, inhibit M1 polarization induced by LPS, and promote M2 polarization. Moreover, GDF15 also enhances the phagocytosis and bactericidal function of macrophages. Finally, we observed a decreased level of the phosphorylation of JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 with the pretreatment of rGDF15. In summary, our study found that GDF15 has good clinical application value in sepsis and plays a protective role in the development of sepsis by regulating the functions of macrophages and inhibiting the activation of JAK1/STAT3 pathway and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65.","Li, Huan; Tang, Dongling; Chen, Juanjuan; Hu, Yuanhui; Cai, Xin; Zhang, Pingan",Front Immunol,87,1

This study investigated the opportunities and barriers to participating in research for the current cohort of UK Palliative Medicine Specialist Trainees (PMSTs), to better understand the opportunities to improve evidence-based practice within the specialty. METHODS Two surveys, one for PMSTs and a second for training programme directors (TPDs), were developed. Surveys were piloted and then reviewed by the UK Palliative trainee Research Collaborative and the Palliative Medicine Specialty Advisory Committee (SAC) before distribution. All current PMSTs and TPDs representing all of the UK training regions (n=13) were invited to complete the appropriate survey. RESULTS Overall, 85% (11/13) and 45% (102/225) of TPDs and PMSTs responded, respectively. Almost all (92%) PMSTs reported that they were either 'very interested' or 'quite interested' in taking part in clinical research. PMSTs generally felt that educationaland clinical supervisors were supportive of them taking part in research; however, few (35%) believed they had access to personnel with adequate research experience to provide practical support. Opportunity for appropriate research supervision varied considerably by training region. Where research was being conducted, it was often conducted in trainees' personal time due to the wide regional variation in dedicated research time. CONCLUSION Despite significant interest in clinical research and support by TPDs and clinical supervisors, access to experienced researchers and equitable protected research time by region needs urgent attention to enhance progress in evidence-based palliative medicine.","Wakefield, Donna; Dewhurst, Felicity; Koffman, Jonathan; Chamberlain, Charlotte",BMJ supportive & palliative care,87,1

Epidemics described in Unani ancient literature include nazla-e-wabai and humma-e-wabai, and most of the symptoms of COVID-19 resemble nazla-e-wabai. Hence, in light of Unani literature, the treatment of COVID-19 can be managed with the composites prescribed in Unani medicine for nazla-e-wabai. In this study, a structure-based drug design approach was carried out to check the effectiveness of the pharmacologically active constituents of the Unani composites prescribed to treat nazla-e-wabai against SARS-CoV-2. We performed molecular docking of the active constituents of these composites against the main protease (Mpro), a potential drug target in SARS-CoV-2. Using detailed molecular docking analysis, Habb-ul-aas and Tabasheer were identified as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The active constituents of both these composites bind to the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, forming interactions with key residues of the binding pocket. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation suggested the binding of active constituents of Habb-ul-aas with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with a strong affinity as compared to the constituents of Tabasheer. Thus, this study sheds light on the use of these Unani composites in COVID-19 therapeutics.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Although the clinical features of COVID-19 become much clearer than before, there are still further problems with the pathophysiological process and treatments of severe patients. One primary problem is with the paradoxical immune states in severe patients with COVID-19. Studies indicate that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can attack the immune system, manifested as a state of immunosuppression with a decrease in lymphocytes, whereas a state of hyperinflammation, presenting as elevated cytokine levels, is also detected in COVID-19. Therefore, discussing the specific status of immunity in COVID-19 will contribute to the understanding of its pathophysiology and the search for appropriate treatments. Here, we review all the available literature concerning the different immune states in COVID-19 and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. In addition, the association between immune states and the development and severity of disease as well as the impact on the selection of immunotherapy strategies are discussed in our review.","Liu, Ye; Li, Yiming; Xu, Dongxue; Zhang, Jing; Peng, Zhiyong",Shock,87,24

The study objective was to assess the on-site applicability and safety of the newly developed JGG endoscope® for the diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in primary care. DESIGN Five Swiss primary care centers and one university affiliated ENT unit participated in this single arm pilot-study. PARTICIPANTS Adults with acute suspected bacterial rhinosinusitis. The newly developed JGG endoscope® , which is attached to a pocket otoscope, was used to inspect the nasal cavity and middle meatus and to gain material for bacterial culture from paranasal sinuses draining ostium, after local anesthesia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES applicability and safety. RESULTS The visualization of the middle meatus was successful in 16 of 21 patients (13 in both sides and three in one side), and unclear or unsuccessful in five patients. Sample collection from the middle meatus was successfully in 10 patients (six on both and four on one side) and unclear or unsuccessful in the remaining patients. Only one culture confirmed bacterial rhinosinusitis and 11 PCR confirmed viral infections were identified from collected samples. After a two-weeks follow-up, no serious adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS The on-site use of the JGG endoscope® in daily primary care routine is feasible and safe and was well accepted by the trial physicians and patients (assessed with structured questionnaires). The JGG endoscope® may support general practitioners to differentiate between bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis.","Glinz, Dominik; Hansen, Jens Georg; Trutmann, Caroline; Schaller, Bernhard; Vogt, Jürg; Diermayr, Claus; Marti, Andreas; Leitmeyer, Katharina; Doerig, Patrick; Zeller, Andreas; Welge-Luessen Lemcke, Antje; Bucher, Heiner",Clinical otolaryngology : official journal of ENT-UK ; official journal of Netherlands Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology & Cervico-Facial Surgery,87,17

RECENT FINDINGS Norovirus (NoV) is the most common viral foodborne pathogen globally (125 million cases and 35 000 deaths). The role of the asymptomatic food handlers in contributing to NoV outbreaks is becoming increasingly clear, with up to one-quarter of outbreaks attributable to them. Handwashing with soap and water remains the best method for removing NoV from fingers. Risk assessment for transmission of emerging viruses through the food chain should include consideration of all means by which food could post a hazard, that is not just consumption. New technologies have demonstrated the widespread nature of viral contamination in the food chain, but this does not necessarily correlate with the risk of disease. Finally, understanding people's knowledge and behaviour is just as important as understanding virus characteristics and epidemiology when assessing risks of foodborne transmission. SUMMARY The predominant viruses transmitted through food tend to be those for which humans are the natural hosts, so that effective control measures need to prevent exposure of foods to human faeces.","Iturriza-Gomara, Miren; O'Brien, Sarah J",Current opinion in infectious diseases,87,11

Although skin grafts and flaps are the standard procedure for reconstruction, sometimes wounds can become chronic. Rigenera Protocol is a new technique based on autologous skin micrografts that reactivates and supports wound healing. A 40-year-old male with Fournier's gangrene, due to a rectal microperforation following diarrhoea, was treated with surgical debridement, negative pressure wound therapy and subsequently coverage with skin grafts. He developed non-healing wounds treated by Rigenera protocol after two months of advanced wound dressings. This technique is based on skin micrografts obtained by mechanical dermal disgregation to provide mesenchymal stem cells and extracellular matrix to the wound. The suspension injected into the wound triggers reactivation of healing without significant residual scarring on both donor site and treated area. Non-healing wounds were reduced by 15% at day 7 and by 50% after 30 days. Wounds completely healed after seventy days. The regenerated tissue appeared closer to skin graft than to scar tissue. This report shows how the use of skin micrografts through Rigenera protocol can be a useful method to reactivate wound healing resulting from Fournier's gangrene, with no discomfort for patient in a practical, safe and easy way.","Bocchiotti, M A; Bogetti, P; Parisi, A; Rivarossa, F; Frenello, A; Baglioni, E A",Journal of wound care,87,28

Here we describe the development of regional norms for the TMT for native Spanish speakers residing in the Southwest Mexico-Border Region of the USA. METHOD Participants were 252 healthy native Spanish speakers, 58% women, from ages 19 to 60, and ranging in education from 0 to 20 years, recruited in San Diego, CA and Tucson, AZ. All completed the TMT in Spanish along with a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery as part of their participation in the Neuropsychological Norms for the US-Mexico Border Region in Spanish (NP-NUMBRS) project. Univariable and interactive effects of demographics on test performance were examined. T-scores were calculated using fractional polynomial equations to account for linear and any non-linear effects of age, education, and sex. RESULTS Older age and lower education were associated with worse scores on both TMT A and B. No sex differences were found. The newly derived T-scores showed no association with demographic variables and displayed the expected 16% rates of impairment using a -1 SD cut point based on a normal distribution. By comparison, published norms for English-speaking non-Hispanic Whites applied to the current data yielded significantly higher impairment for both TMT A and B with more comparable rates using non-Hispanic African Americans norms. CONCLUSIONS Population-specific, demographically adjusted regional norms improve the utility and diagnostic accuracy of the TMT for use with native Spanish speakers in the US-Mexico Border region.","Suarez, Paola A; Díaz-Santos, Mirella; Marquine, Maria J; Kamalyan, Lily; Mindt, Monica Rivera; Umlauf, Anya; Heaton, Robert K; Grant, Igor; Cherner, Mariana",The Clinical neuropsychologist,87,17

In this study, we conducted statistical analysis on the natural shock of COVID-19 to investigate whether the large hospitals will draw health demand from the small hospitals when a supply capacity surplus is present, a phenomenon otherwise known as the ""siphon effect"". Methods We collected the monthly hospital income and service data, including outpatient income, inpatient income, number of visits, and discharges, from all public hospitals, from January 2018 to July 2020 in Shanghai. A difference-in-differences (DIDs) method was applied to analyze the existence of the large hospitals' siphon effect by identifying the differences in the healthcare service market share change between large and small hospital groups at the height of pandemic (February and March, 2020) and the postpandemic period (April and May, 2020). Case mix index (CMI) was used to verify whether the reduction in healthcare amount and market share of small hospitals was due to unnecessary care. Results In total, 156 public hospitals, including 46 large hospitals and 110 small hospitals, with an average number of beds of 1,079.21 and 345.25, respectively, were involved in this study. At the height of the pandemic, the healthcare service volume and revenue in public hospitals in Shanghai experienced a sharp decline, especially for large hospitals and inpatient services. Compared to small hospitals at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, large hospitals' market share decreased significantly in outpatient and inpatient services for overall and nonlocal patients (P<0.05). During the postpandemic period, large hospitals' market share increased significantly in outpatient and inpatient services for overall and local patients (P<0.05). This increase was more substantial in inpatient services. Conclusions Under conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic of higher care-seeking costs in the large hospitals, some of the healthcare services typically provided by large hospitals were then supplied by small hospitals. Furthermore, the siphon effect of large hospitals could be clearly observed when a supply capacity surplus was present and external constraint on patients' care-seeking behavior was absent.","Chen, Yuqian; Wang, Linan; Cui, Xin; Xu, Jiajie; Xu, Yingqi; Yang, Zhonghao; Jin, Chunlin",Annals of translational medicine,87,20

One hundred and twenty-seven unresectable large HCC patients receiving drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) treatment with CalliSpheres or HepaSpheres microspheres were analyzed. Treatment response, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score, adverse events, main liver function indexes, time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Objective response rate (82.7% vs. 63.8%, p=.030) and disease control rate (100.0% vs. 91.5%, p=.030) were increased in CalliSpheres group compared to HepaSpheres group at 1 month after treatment, while no difference was found between the two groups regarding treatment response at 3 or 6 months post treatment (all p>.05). The KPS score at 1, 3, and 6 months was similar between the two groups (all p>.05). As for the liver function, the ALT, AST, ALB, and TBIL levels at 7 and 30 days were of no difference between the two groups (all p>.05). In addition, the adverse events including nausea/vomiting, pain, fever, myelosuppression, biloma, and abscess were of no difference between the two groups, either (all p>.05). In terms of survival profile, there was no difference regarding TTP (6.3 months (95%CI: 5.9-6.6 months) vs. 6.0 months (95%CI: 5.6-6.4 months), p=.082) or OS (23.0 months (95%CI: 20.1-25.9 months) vs. 22.0 months (95%CI: 20.2-23.8 months), p=.571) between the two groups. In conclusion, CalliSpheres seems to be superior in short-term efficacy and equal in long-term efficacy as well as safety compared to HepaSpheres for DEB-TACE treatment in unresectable large HCC patients.","Zhao, Guangsheng; Liu, Song; Chen, Songbai; Ren, Zhizhong; Li, Chuang; Bian, Jie; Wu, Jianlin; Zhou, Jun; Zhang, Yuewei",Drug delivery,87,11

Carbon dioxide removal is possible with substantially less extracorporeal blood flow than needed for oxygenation. Techniques for extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal include (1) pumpless arterio-venous circuits, (2) low-flow venovenous circuits based on the technology of continuous renal replacement therapy, and (3) venovenous circuits based on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation technology. INDICATIONS Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal has been shown to enable more protective ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, even beyond the so-called ""protective"" level. Although experimental data suggest a benefit on ventilator induced lung injury, no hard clinical evidence with respect to improved outcome exists. In addition, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal is a tool to avoid intubation and mechanical ventilation in patients with acute exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease failing non-invasive ventilation. This concept has been shown to be effective in 56-90% of patients. Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal has also been used in ventilated patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure to correct acidosis, unload respiratory muscle burden, and facilitate weaning. In patients suffering from terminal fibrosis awaiting lung transplantation, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal is able to correct acidosis and enable spontaneous breathing during bridging. Keeping these patients awake, ambulatory, and breathing spontaneously is associated with favorable outcome. COMPLICATIONS Complications of extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal are mostly associated with vascular access and deranged hemostasis leading to bleeding. Although the spectrum of complications may differ, no technology offers advantages with respect to rate and severity of complications. So called ""high-extraction systems"" working with higher blood flows and larger membranes may be more effective with respect to clinical goals.","Staudinger, Thomas",Perfusion,87,1

Laboratories keep on investigating the performance of these assays. In this study, we compared three fully automated SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. Methods A total of 186 samples from 84 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients and 120 control samples taken before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were analyzed using commercial serologic assays from Roche, Siemens and DiaSorin. Time after the positive COVID-19 PCR result and onset of symptoms was retrieved from the medical record. An extended golden standard, using the result of all three assays was defined, judging if antibodies are present or absent in a sample. Diagnostic and screening sensitivity/specificity and positive/negative predictive value were calculated. Results Diagnostic sensitivity (ability to detect a COVID-19 positive patient) ≥14 days after positive PCR testing was 96.7% (95% CI 88.5-99.6%) for DiaSorin, 93.3% (95% CI 83.8-98.2%) for Roche and 100% (95% CI 94.0-100%) for Siemens. Lower diagnostic sensitivities were observed <14 days after onset of symptoms for all three assay. Diagnostic specificity (ability to detect a COVID-19 negative patient) was 95.0% (95% CI 89.4-98.1%) for DiaSorin, 99.2% (95% CI 95.4-99.9%) for Roche and 100% (95% CI 97.0-100%) for Siemens. The sensitivity/specificity for detecting antibodies (ability of detecting absence (specificity) or presence (sensitivity) of COVID-19 antibodies) was 92.4% (95% CI 86.4-96.3%)/94.9% (95% CI 90.5-97.6%) for DiaSorin, 97.7% (95% CI 93.5-99.5%)/97.1% (95% CI 93.5-99.1%) for Roche and 98.5% (95% CI 94.6-99.8)/97.1 (95% CI 93.5-99.1%) for Siemens.

Meaningful differences between the available needles have been difficult to identify. Recently, a new EUS needle (Shark Core®, Covidien, Dublin, Leinster, Ireland), has been introduced in an attempt to improve diagnostic accuracy, tissue yield, and to potentially obtain a core tissue sample. We performed a pilot study prospectively to evaluate this new needle when compared to a standard EUS-FNA needle. MATERIALS AND METHODS Analysis of the first 15 patients undergoing EUS-FNA with the Shark Core needle was performed and it was compared to EUS-FNA in 15 patients who underwent EUS-FNA with a standard needle. RESULTS The Shark Core needle required fewer needle passes to obtain diagnostic adequacy than the standard needle [(χ(2)(1) = 11.3, P < 0.001]. The Shark Core needle required 1.5 passes to reach adequacy, whereas the standard needle required three passes. For cases with cell blocks, the Shark Core needle produced diagnostic material in 85% of cases [95% confidence interval (CI): 54-98], whereas the standard needle produced diagnostic material in 38% of the cases (95% CI: 9-76). The Shark Core needle produced actual tissue cores 82% of the time (95% CI: 48-98) and the standard needle produced no tissue cores (95% CI: 0-71) (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION This pilot study found that the Shark Core needle had a high rate of producing adequate cytologic material for the diagnosis of pancreatic and peri-pancreatic lesions sampled by EUS with fewer passes required to obtain a definitive diagnosis and with a high rate of tissue cores being obtained when compared to a standard FNA needle.","Adler, Douglas G; Witt, Benjamin; Chadwick, Barbara; Wells, Jason; Taylor, Linda Jo; Dimaio, Christopher; Schmidt, Robert",Endoscopic ultrasound,87,1

These data support the concept that there are gender specific microvascular responses to a fluid-shift countermeasure such as LBNP Thus, gender differences should be considered while developing future countermeasure strategies to headward fluid shifts in microgravity.","Siamwala, Jamila H; Macias, Brandon R; Lee, Paul C; Hargens, Alan R",Physiological reports,87,27

Yet, that occurred at the very onset of the COVID-19 era, a time that has shattered any preconceived notions of what I might experience during a clinical visit. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many physicians to approach patient care in completely different ways. While many have been providing care in hospitals, many more of us have had to stop seeing patients in person, shift to telemedicine, and consider other ways to improve the health of our patients. The rapid changes we have had to make in the last year have demonstrated the resiliency of our profession.

This study evaluated a new transpancreatic U-suture technique (Blumgart anastomosis, BA), which aims to avoid shear forces during knot-tying. METHODS Using a before-after study design, BA was compared with a modified Cattell-Warren anastomosis (CWA). Two patient cohorts (CWA, 90; BA, 92), which were similar with respect to primary diagnosis, age, sex and American Society of Anesthesiologists score, were compared retrospectively. Dependent variables were surgical and overall morbidity and mortality after partial pancreaticoduodenectomy. RESULTS Duration of operation (354 versus 328 min for CWA versus BA; P = 0.002), pancreatic leakage rate (13 versus 4 per cent; P = 0.032), postoperative haemorrhage (11 versus 3 per cent; P = 0.040), total surgical complications (31 versus 15 per cent; P = 0.011), general complications (36 versus 17 per cent; P = 0.005) and length of intensive care unit stay (median 5.4 versus 2.8 days; P = 0.015) were significantly reduced after BA. These effects were not related merely to an improvement over time. CONCLUSION BA appears to be a fast, simple and safe technique for pancreaticojejunostomy. It might reduce leakage rates and surgical complications after partial pancreaticoduodenectomy.","Kleespies, A; Rentsch, M; Seeliger, H; Albertsmeier, M; Jauch, K-W; Bruns, C J",The British journal of surgery,87,19

Trump which establishes a new legal mechanism for Guantanamo detainees being held in indefinite detention to receive independent psychiatric evaluations from mixed medical commissions in order to determine eligibility for repatriation on humanitarian grounds. The article first reviews how the U.S. government created a legal framework for Global War on Terror detainees that differs from established conventions under international humanitarian law to protect prisoners of war. It discusses the circumstances of a Guantanamo detainee named Mohammed al-Qahtani who was tortured in U.S. custody, according to Guantanamo's top official. The U.S. government has declined to refer legal charges against him but also refused to release him since he has been considered a threat to U.S. national security. The article analyzes how al-Qahtani's attorneys challenged the legality of his detention and referred to an independent psychiatric evaluation played to establish the legal basis for ""irreparable harm."" al-Qahtani's independent psychiatric evaluation asserted that he displayed symptoms consistent with those exhibited by survivors of torture. Legally, the ruling establishes a precedent for Guantanamo detainees who are being held in indefinite detention to compel the U.S. government to clarify their legal status or arrange an examination by a mixed medical commission. Twenty-two other detainees out of the forty still at Guantanamo fall in this legal category, so the precedent has far-reaching consequences. Finally, the prospect of mixed medical commissions composed of international experts who are collaborating to render a medical opinion raises questions about how independent psychiatric evaluations would be conducted in practice.","Aggarwal, Neil Krishan",International journal of law and psychiatry,87,1

Recommendations are useful as little guidance is available for repeat testing in patients being followed expectantly for changes in disease. METHODS A review of laboratory data of tests for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was performed selecting patients who had changing results. Time between changes in test results was determined to provide guidance for repeat testing. RESULTS The Interquartile Range (IQR) of data for patients who had a negative to positive change in laboratory testing (progression) was 6-16 days (median=9 days). The IQR of data for patients who had a positive to negative change in test results (remission) was 9-21 days (median=14 days). CONCLUSION Because sampling of the nares or nasopharynx can be variable, repeat testing should be performed swiftly when symptomatic patients are negative. The data in this short study vary widely, so authors recommend repeat testing during a period of time associated with the IQR or median (see results above).","Williams, Nathan; Idriss, Reed; Dodge, Jessica; Barasch, Samuel",Journal of clinical pathology,87,33

With an ageing and increasingly obese population, OA will become more prevalent. Obesity and metabolic syndrome are risk factors for OA and have been implicated in its pathogenesis. The gut microbiome may shed light on this possible common pathogenesis. Recent animal and human studies have gained important insights into the relationship between OA, obesity, and the gut microbiome. Animal studies have demonstrated links between obesity and increased severity of OA and altered gut microbial DNA profile. Use of prebiotics and probiotics in animal trials provides proof-of-concept that interventional options to the gut microbiome can modulate the progression of OA favorably. Current evidence in human studies is limited. Shifts in gut microbial profile and reduced gut microbial diversity have been associated with people with OA, as well as blood and synovial fluid lipopolysaccharide endotoxemia. Linkages between microbiome dysbiosis and host responses may help in the understanding of OA pathogenesis and the discovery of therapeutic targets.

This geographic reshuffling may result in novel co-occurrences among species, which could lead to unseen biotic interactions, including the exchange of parasites between previously isolated hosts. Identifying potential new host-parasite interactions would improve forecasting of disease emergence and inform proactive disease surveillance. However, accurate predictions of future cross-species disease transmission have been hampered by the lack of a generalized approach and data availability. Here, we propose a framework to predict novel host-parasite interactions based on a combination of niche modelling of future host distributions and parasite sharing models. Using the North American ungulates as a proof of concept, we show this approach has high cross-validation accuracy in over 85% of modelled parasites and find that more than 34% of the host-parasite associations forecasted by our models have already been recorded in the literature. We discuss potential sources of uncertainty and bias that may affect our results and similar forecasting approaches, and propose pathways to generate increasingly accurate predictions. Our results indicate that forecasting parasite sharing in response to shifts in host geographic distributions allow for the identification of regions and taxa most susceptible to emergent pathogens under climate change.

Beyond the loss of parasite species richness, host extinction can impact apparent parasite host specificity, as measured by host richness or the phylogenetic distances among hosts. Such impacts on the distribution of parasites across the host phylogeny can have knock-on effects that may reshape the adaptation of both hosts and parasites, ultimately shifting the evolutionary landscape underlying the potential for emergence and the evolution of virulence across hosts. Here, we examine how the reshaping of host phylogenies through extinction may impact the host specificity of parasites, and offer examples from historical extinctions, present-day endangerment, and future projections of biodiversity loss. We suggest that an improved understanding of the impact of host extinction on contemporary host-parasite interactions may shed light on core aspects of disease ecology, including comparative studies of host specificity, virulence evolution in multi-host parasite systems, and future trajectories for host and parasite biodiversity.

BACKGROUND Total proctocolectomy with IPAA is known to be associated with postoperative infertility in open surgery, which may be caused by pelvic adhesions affecting the fallopian tubes. However, fertility after laparoscopic IPAA has never been assessed. METHODS All patients who underwent a total laparoscopic IPAA between 2000 and 2011 and were aged 45 years or less at the time of operation and 18 years or more at the time of data collection were included. The patients answered a fertility questionnaire by telephone. All demographic and perioperative data were prospectively collected. The results were compared with those of controls undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy. RESULTS Sixty-three patients were included. The mean age at the time of surgery was 31 ± 9 years (range 14-44). IPAA was performed for ulcerative colitis in 73% of the cases and familial adenomatous polyposis in 17%. The mean follow-up after IPAA was 68 ± 33 months (range 6-136). Fifty-six patients answered the questionnaire (89%). Half of them already had a child before IPAA. Fifteen patients attempted pregnancy after IPAA, of which 11 (73%) were able to conceive, resulting in 10 ongoing pregnancies and 1 miscarriage. The global infertility rate was 27%. There was no difference in fertility over time compared with the 14 controls who attempted pregnancy during the same period (90% vs 86% at 36 months, P = 0.397). CONCLUSIONS The infertility rate appears to be lower after laparoscopic IPAA than after open surgery.","Beyer-Berjot, Laura; Maggiori, Léon; Birnbaum, David; Lefevre, Jérémie H; Berdah, Stéphane; Panis, Yves",Annals of surgery,87,31

This disease occurs when high blood glucose levels cause damage to blood vessels in the retina. Computer-aided DR diagnosis has become a promising tool for the early detection and severity grading of DR, due to the great success of deep learning. However, most current DR diagnosis systems do not achieve satisfactory performance or interpretability for ophthalmologists, due to the lack of training data with consistent and fine-grained annotations. To address this problem, we construct a large fine-grained annotated DR dataset containing 2,842 images (FGADR). Specifically, this dataset has 1,842 images with pixel-level DR-related lesion annotations, and 1,000 images with image-level labels graded by six board-certified ophthalmologists with intra-rater consistency. The proposed dataset will enable extensive studies on DR diagnosis. Further, we establish three benchmark tasks for evaluation: 1. DR lesion segmentation; 2. DR grading by joint classification and segmentation; 3. Transfer learning for ocular multi-disease identification. Moreover, a novel inductive transfer learning method is introduced for the third task. Extensive experiments using different state-of-the-art methods are conducted on our FGADR dataset, which can serve as baselines for future research.

The novel viral lineages P.1 (Variant of Concern Gamma) and P.2, respectively identified in the Brazilian states of Amazonas and Rio de Janeiro, have been associated with potentially higher transmission rates and antibody neutralization escape. In this study, we performed the whole-genome sequencing of 185 samples isolated from three out of the five Brazilian regions, including Amazonas (North region), Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba and Bahia (Northeast region), and Rio de Janeiro (Southeast region) in order to monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Brazil in the first months of 2021. Here, we showed a widespread dispersal of P.1 and P.2 across Brazilian regions and, except for Amazonas, P.2 was the predominant lineage identified in the sampled states. We estimated the origin of P.2 lineage to have happened in February, 2020 and identified that it has differentiated into new clades. Interstate transmission of P.2 was detected since March, but reached its peak in December, 2020 and January, 2021. Transmission of P.1 was also high in December and its origin was inferred to have happened in August 2020. We also confirmed the presence of lineage P.7, recently described in the southernmost region of Brazil, to have spread across the Northeastern states. P.1, P.2 and P.7 are descended from the ancient B.1.1.28 strain, which co-dominated the first phase of the pandemic in Brazil with the B.1.1.33 strain. We also identified the occurrence of a new lineage descending from B.1.1.33 that convergently carries the E484K mutation, N.9. Indeed, the recurrent report of many novel SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants in Brazil could be due to the absence of effective control measures resulting in high SARS-CoV2 transmission rates. Altogether, our findings provided a landscape of the critical state of SARS-CoV-2 across Brazil and confirm the need to sustain continuous sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates worldwide in order to identify novel variants of interest and monitor for vaccine effectiveness.","Lamarca, Alessandra P; de Almeida, Luiz G P; Francisco, Ronaldo da Silva; Lima, Lucymara Fassarella Agnez; Scortecci, Kátia Castanho; Perez, Vinícius Pietta; Brustolini, Otavio J; Sousa, Eduardo Sérgio Soares; Secco, Danielle Angst; Santos, Angela Maria Guimarães; Albuquerque, George Rego; Mariano, Ana Paula Melo; Maciel, Bianca Mendes; Gerber, Alexandra L; Guimarães, Ana Paula de C; Nascimento, Paulo Ricardo; Neto, Francisco Paulo Freire; Gadelha, Sandra Rocha; Porto, Luís Cristóvão; Campana, Eloiza Helena; Jeronimo, Selma Maria Bezerra; Vasconcelos, Ana Tereza R",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,87,1

The optimal needle device and technique for EUS-LB is still evolving. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of two second-generation 19G fine-needle biopsy (FNB) (Franseen- and Fork-tip) devices for EUS-LB. METHODS This is a repeated-measure crossover study with a prospectively maintained cohort of patients. We performed EUS-LB with a one-pass and single-actuation method using two 19G FNB needles in 22 consecutive patients between 10/2018 and 9/2019. Patients were randomized to left vs right liver lobes to be biopsied as well as the needle sequence. The specimens obtained were evaluated for adequacy for histologic diagnosis. The primary outcome was number of complete portal tracts (CPTs), post-fix aggregate, and longest specimen length. Secondary outcomes were prefix aggregate specimen length and the specimen adequacy judged by two expert pathologists. RESULTS A total of 44 liver biopsies were performed in 22 patients. The CPTs were higher in the Franseen-tip needle group compared to the Fork-tip needle group (14.4 vs 9.5, p = 0.043). Post-fix aggregate specimen length (44.9 mm vs 34.6 mm, p = 0.097), the post-fix longest specimen length (19.9 mm vs 13.7 mm, p = 0.175), and prefix aggregate specimen length (51.7 mm vs 45 mm, p = 0.265) were not significantly different. Both needles showed similarly high histologic adequacy (100% vs 95.5%, p = 0.312). Interestingly, the right of the liver showed higher yield of CPTs with both needles (Franseen, 16.2 vs. 12.8, p = 0.003, the Fork-tip, 12.8 vs. 7.0, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION EUS-guided liver biopsy using the 19G Franseen-tip needle may provide more CPTs than 19G Fork-tip needle on a single-pass, single-actuation comparison.","Hashimoto, Rintaro; Lee, David P; Samarasena, Jason B; Chandan, Vishal S; Guo, Wenchang; Lee, John G; Chang, Kenneth J",Digestive diseases and sciences,87,1

It is noteworthy that the results were confirmed in a cynomolgus monkey model. Moreover, topically administrated cNPs showed low in vivo toxicity because of their retention in skin. Mechanistic analyses of cytokine expression in the psoriatic site, cfDNA levels in circulation and inflamed skin, skin permeation, and biodistribution of cNPs also matched the therapeutic outcomes.

The immunologic pathways activated in face transplant rejection have not been fully characterized. METHODS Utilizing skin biopsies prospectively collected over nine years from seven face transplant patients, we studied rejection by gene expression profiling, histology, immunostaining and T cell receptor sequencing. RESULTS Grade 1 rejection did not differ significantly from non-rejection, suggesting that it does not represent a pathologic state and that watchful waiting is warranted. In Grade 2, there was a balanced upregulation of both pro-inflammatory T cell activation pathways and anti-inflammatory checkpoint and immunomodulatory pathways, with a net result of no tissue injury. In Grade 3, IFNγ-driven inflammation, antigen presenting cell activation and infiltration of the skin by proliferative T cells bearing markers of antigen specific activation and cytotoxic effector molecules tipped the balance towards tissue injury. Rejection of VCA and solid organ transplants had both distinct and common features. VCA rejection was uniquely associated with upregulation of immunoregulatory genes, including SOCS1, induction of lipid antigen-presenting CD1 proteins, and infiltration by T cells predicted to recognize CD1b and CD1c. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that the distinct features of VCA rejection reflect the unique immunobiology of skin and that enhancing cutaneous immunoregulatory networks may be a useful strategy in combatting rejection.","Win, Thet Su; Crisler, William J; Dyring-Andersen, Beatrice; Lopdrup, Rachel; Teague, Jessica E; Zhan, Qian; Barrera, Victor; Ho Sui, Shannan J; Tasigiorgos, Sotirios; Murakami, Naoka; Chandraker, Anil; Tullius, Stefan G; Pomahac, Bohdan; Riella, Leonardo V; Clark, Rachael",The Journal of clinical investigation,87,20

The purpose of this study was to compare single-incision laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (panLESS) with conventional laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (panLAP) to assess feasibility and 30-day morbidity. METHODS Eight consecutive patients who underwent panLESS were matched with patients who underwent panLAP in the same time period. Matching criteria were age, body mass index, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score. Feasibility was based on tumor size, operative time, intraoperative bleeding, resection status, and hospital stay. Thirty-day morbidity was defined by the revised Accordion Classification system and the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula definition. RESULTS Over a 19-month period, 8 and 16 patients were identified for panLESS and panLAP, respectively. There were no significant differences in tumor size, operative time, intraoperative bleeding, resection status, and hospital stay between the two groups. Surgical complications developed in four panLESS patients and five panLAP patients, and out of which, two patients from each group developed a postoperative pancreatic fistula (grade B). CONCLUSIONS This study indicates that panLESS is comparable to panLAP in terms of feasibility. More experience is needed to define what role single-incision distal pancreatectomy should have in minimal invasive pancreatic surgery.","Haugvik, Sven-Petter; Røsok, Bård Ingvald; Waage, Anne; Mathisen, Oystein; Edwin, Bjørn",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,87,1

The experience of crisis management is a lesson learned that guides future preparedness for similar casualties. Thus, the present study takes an in-depth look at the knowledge, attitude, and practice of forensic practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Arab world. A comprehensive questionnaire was adopted in compliance with optimum international standards for the management of deaths during the pandemic. The survey was electronically distributed in 13 Arab countries. The responses were received from 29 forensic practitioners from 11 countries. Total median knowledge, attitude, and practice scores of respondents constituted 37.9%, 74%, and 36.8% of optimum scores respectively. Regarding knowledge, better scores are related to risk assessment and routes of exposure to Coronavirus, whereas, least scores were related to ventilation and negative pressure system. Most of the participants had a positive attitude, 85.2% were concerned about proper management of COVID-19 deaths, and 77.8% trusted the decisions of their teams. Considering practice, better scores are related to forensic staff competence, whereas, least scores were related to the implementation of ideal safety measures. Participants described the management process as useful (52%), reliable (35%), high quality (21%), and cost-effective (17%), however, they expressed challenges as staff infection, limited resources, and infrastructure issues. This survey guides readjusting of procedures and future preparedness for similar disasters in the Arab world. This research adopted a questionnaire that could be used in initial and periodic assessments in any medicolegal institute worldwide. Also, it could support infrastructure projects and disaster management plans.","Zaki, Mamdouh Kamal; Sobh, Zahraa Khalifa",Legal medicine,87,31

HDV genome is divided into a viroid-like sequence and a protein-coding sequence which could have originated from different resources and the HDV genome was eventually constituted through RNA recombination. The genome subsequently diversified through accumulation of mutations selected by interactions between the mutated RNA and proteins with host factors to successfully form the infectious virions. Therefore, we propose that the conservation of HDV nucleotide sequence is highly related with its functionality. Genome analysis of known HDV isolates shows that the C-terminal coding sequences of large delta antigen (LDAg) are the highest diversity than other regions of protein-coding sequences but they still retain biological functionality to interact with the heavy chain of clathrin can be selected and maintained. Since viruses interact with many host factors, including escaping the host immune response, how to design a program to predict RNA genome evolution is a great challenging work.","Huang, Chi-Ruei; Lo, Szecheng J",Advances in bioinformatics,87,1

They could be divided into direct (viral), secondary (somatogenic) and post(para)infectious (autoimmune) variants according to the pathogenetic mechanisms of their development. The most common type is a secondary impairment of the nervous system presented with encephalopathy of hypoxic, infectious/toxic or dysmetabolic origin. Its major mechanism is related to the brain edema while clinical presentations include non-specific symptoms such as headaches, dizziness and consciousness impairments. Only single reports exist on coronavirus meningoencephalitides. Postinfectious complications of COVID-19 mostly presented with different forms of Gulliane-Barre syndrome. Stroke is registered in 2.5-5% of COVID-19 cases. Their development is associated with hypercoagulation and endothelial dysfunction.

The aim of this study was to determine healthcare-associated UTI (HAUTI) and catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) point prevalence in six Australian hospitals to inform a national point prevalence process and compare two internationally accepted HAUTI definitions. We also described the level and comprehensiveness of clinical record documentation, microbiology laboratory and coding data at identifying HAUTIs and CAUTIs. SETTING Data were collected from three public and three private Australian hospitals over the first 6 months of 2013. PARTICIPANTS A total of 1109 patients were surveyed. Records of patients of all ages, hospitalised on the day of the point prevalence at the study sites, were eligible for inclusion. Outpatients, patients in adult mental health units, patients categorised as maintenance care type (ie, patients waiting to be transferred to a long-term care facility) and those in the emergency department during the duration of the survey were excluded. OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measures were the HAUTI and CAUTI point prevalence. RESULTS Overall HAUTI and CAUTI prevalence was 1.4% (15/1109) and 0.9% (10/1109), respectively. Staphylococcus aureus and Candida species were the most common pathogens. One-quarter (26.3%) of patients had a urinary catheter and fewer than half had appropriate documentation. Eight of the 15 patients ascertained to have a HAUTI based on clinical records (6 being CAUTI) were coded by the medical records department with an International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 code for UTI diagnosis. The Health Protection Agency Surveillance definition had a positive predictive value of 91.67% (CI 64.61 to 98.51) compared against the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition.

Infectious disease may produce an apparently similar form of isolation-disease avoidance-but on symptom remission this often abates. We propose that many forms of stigmatization reflect the activation of this disease-avoidance system, which is prone to respond to visible signs and labels that connote disease, irrespective of their accuracy. A model of this system is presented, which includes an emotional component, whereby visible disease cues directly activate disgust and contamination, motivating avoidance, and a cognitive component, whereby disease labels bring to mind disease cues, indirectly activating disgust and contamination. The unique predictions of this model are then examined, notably that people who are stigmatized evoke disgust and are contaminating. That animals too show avoidance of diseased conspecifics, and that disease-related stigma targets are avoided in most cultures, also supports this evolutionary account. The more general implications of this approach are then examined, notably how it can be used to good (e.g. improving hygiene) or bad (e.g. racial vilification) ends, by yoking particular labels with cues that connote disease and disgust. This broadening of the model allows for stigmatization of groups with little apparent connection to disease.","Oaten, Megan; Stevenson, Richard J; Case, Trevor I","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

This study aims to address these issues by proposing fixations made of functionally graded materials (FGMs). The computational study of bone remodeling was performed by linking a bone remodeling algorithm to the finite element analysis. The 3D model of the femur was created by computerized tomography (CT) scan images, and a Titanium fixture, along with nine Titanium/Hydroxyapatite FGM fixtures, were modeled. The analyses revealed evident advantages for the FGM fixtures over the conventionally used Titanium fixtures. Furthermore, it was shown that the gradation direction considerably affects the bone adaptation procedure. The results showed that using a radial FGM with low-stiffness material in the outer layer and less metal composition significantly improves the bone remodeling behavior.","Ghaziani, Armin Omidvar; Soheilifard, Reza; Kowsar, Sara",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,87,16

Deficits in working memory and response inhibition are potential mechanisms underlying urgency, and a previous study showed that cognitive training targeting these domains is efficacious in reducing urgency. However, the feasibility and efficacy of this intervention has not yet been tested in a clinical sample or naturalistic treatment setting. To fill this gap, we conducted a pilot study of cognitive training for individuals reporting high levels of urgency in a partial hospitalization program. We evaluated this intervention in an open trial (n = 20), followed by a randomized controlled trial (n = 46) comparing cognitive training plus treatment as usual to treatment as usual. Results supported the feasibility and acceptability of cognitive training. Participants in the training group showed significant improvement on cognitive tasks, but groups did not differ in urgency. In pooled analyses combining the open trial and RCT, there was a significant reduction in distress intolerance in the training group only. Results indicate the potential benefit of cognitive training for distress intolerance, but do not support the use of cognitive training for urgency in acute clinical settings.

Our objective was to develop a reusable, mobile-friendly application for collecting PROs and experiences to support COVID-19 symptom self-monitoring and data sharing with appropriate public health agencies, using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) for interoperability. We conducted a needs assessment and designed and developed StayHome, a mobile PRO administration tool. FHIR serves as the primary data model and driver of business logic.

METHODS Between January 2005 and July 2018, 123 cases of thoracoscopic surgery for PSP were reviewed. The principle procedure was bullectomy accompanied by mechanical and chemical pleurodesis. Approximately 4 h after surgery, we confirmed patients' sufficient recovery from anesthesia and investigated the presence of air leak in a sitting position. Chest tubes were removed on the same day as the surgery if there was no air leak or bloody drainage observed. Postoperative complications and factors that prevented early chest tube removal were analyzed by comparing the early removal group and the remaining tube group. RESULTS Chest tubes could be removed on the day of the surgery in 105 cases (85.4%). There were 7 cases (5.7%) in which chest tubes could be removed because air leak was not detected after patients' recovery despite intraoperative detection of minor air leak from the resection stump. No patients required chest tube reinsertion during their hospital stay. The mean length of postoperative hospital stay was 1.1 ± 0.5 days. In a logistic regression analysis, surgical history of ipsilateral PSP was independently and significantly associated with the prevention of early chest tube removal. CONCLUSIONS Chest tube removal on the day of surgery for PSP appears to be safe when air leak examination can be performed after sufficient recovery from anesthesia.","Furuya, Tatsuo; Ii, Tsunehiro; Yanada, Masashi; Toda, Shogo",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,87,27

Therapy with dental implants is being used on a large scale to replace missing teeth and to rehabilitate edentulous patients with overdentures and implant supported fixed dentures as a method of solving the problem of instability and lack of retention associated with conventional removable prostheses. Fixed implant supported prostheses are an alternative for implant rehabilitation treatment that allow patients to have new fixed teeth. They can be indicated in partial or total edentulous patients, and they can replace single teeth, or teeth and supporting tissues (hybrid prosthesis). They overcome the limitations of conventional dentures, increasing stability and retention, providing functional and psychological advantages for the patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will electronically search for randomised controlled trials evaluating the effects of fixed implant supported prostheses in edentulous patients in the following databases: Pubmed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We will also try to obtain literature screening references of included studies, searching for trial protocols in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, reviewing International Team for Implantology conference proceedings and searching for non-published studies through Open Gray. Two researchers will independently undertake selection of studies, data extraction and assessment of the quality of the included studies.

Recently, high stroke volume variation (SVV) has been reported as an alternative to L-CVP for reducing blood loss during a hepatectomy. The current study evaluated the impact of a newly implemented SVV-based goal-directed therapy (GDT) protocol on blood loss during hepatectomy. METHODS We conducted a before-after comparative study, which included L-CVP-assisted hepatectomy cases (control group) and GDT-assisted hepatectomy cases (intervention group). The GDT protocol included SVV, cardiac index, and mean arterial pressure as hemodynamic parameters. The target SVV ranges were ≥ 13% and ≤ 12% before and after the resection, respectively. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients whose blood loss was < 400 mL (median of our hepatectomy cases) in the GDT group, and it was compared to a predefined threshold of 50%. We also investigated factors associated with blood loss using multiple regression analysis. RESULTS We included 66 patients in the control group and 50 in the GDT group. In the GDT group, the median blood loss was 220 mL and 36 patients (72%) lost < 400 mL blood. This was significantly greater than 50% (P < 0.001). Post-resection GDT-guided fluid optimization reduced positive intraoperative fluid balance compared to that achieved by the conventional fluid therapy used in the control. Multiple regression analysis showed that GDT application, epidural anesthesia, operative time, and hydroxyethyl-starch infusion volume were associated with blood loss. CONCLUSION Compared to conventional management, SVV-guided GDT may reduce blood loss during hepatectomies.","Mizunoya, Kazuyuki; Fujii, Tomoaki; Yamamoto, Masataka; Tanaka, Nobuhiro; Morimoto, Yuji",Journal of anesthesia,87,4

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of three different non-sternotomy techniques on long-term outcomes after left single-vessel revascularization. METHODS A total of 502 patients having single-vessel LAD disease treated from April 2003 to May 2013 by minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting (MIDCAB), endoscopically assisted coronary artery bypass grafting (EACAB) or robotically assisted direct coronary artery bypass grafting (RADCAB) were reviewed. In all cases, distal anastomoses were performed through anterolateral minithoracotomy incisions. In-hospital and long-term (10-year) outcomes were compared using standard and propensity score-adjusted analyses. RESULTS One hundred and eighty-nine patients had MIDCAB, 76 had EACAB and 236 had RADCAB. After propensity score matching, RADCAB patients had significantly longer operative duration (P < 0.001), whereas MIDCAB and RADCAB patients had significantly higher incidence of postoperative angina over the follow-up (P = 0.034). The groups were comparable regarding in-hospital mortality and reintervention rate as well as incidence of myocardial infarction, reoperations, reinterventions and cardiac death. All groups showed comparable long-term survival (P = 0.943). CONCLUSIONS MIDCAB, EACAB and RADCAB are associated with similar long-term survival and incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) in single-vessel surgical revascularization. However, the endoscopic approach was found to be free from the disadvantages of longer operating duration observed in RADCAB or higher incidence of angina and shorter freedom from MACEs observed in both MIDCAB and RADCAB groups.","Sabashnikov, Anton; Patil, Nikhil P; Weymann, Alexander; Mohite, Prashant N; Zych, Bartlomiej; García Sáez, Diana; Popov, Aron-Frederik; Wahlers, Thorsten; Wittwer, Thorsten; Wippermann, Jens; Amrani, Mohamed; Trimlett, Richard; Simon, André R; Pepper, John; Bahrami, Toufan",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,87,1

Concentration-dependent TdP scores were determined by drug-induced changes in QT, Tp-e and proarrhythmias. Disclosure of the names and testing concentrations was made after completion of the experiments and report to the sponsors. Drugs' normalized TdP scores were calculated thereafter based on their respective free clinical Cmax . Drugs' normalized TdP scores were calculated and ranked for 33 drugs, excluding one investigational drug, and the TdP risks of the 28 CiPA drugs were correctly distinguished according to their respective categories of low, intermediate and high TdP risks under the CiPA initiative. Accordingly, we are able to propose the cut-off values of the normalized TdP scores at 1xCmax : ≤0, >0 to <0.65 and ≥0.65 respectively for low, intermediate and high risk. This blinded study supports utility of our Normalized TdP Score System in predicting drug-induced TdP risks in 33 drugs including 28 used for characterization of other assays under the CiPA initiative.

Decreased vaccination rates have been reported in many countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we compared the vaccination rates of the current year with those of the same period of 2019 in Ankara and presented the physicians' thoughts about effects of COVID-19 pandemic on vaccinations in Turkey. An online survey was sent to family practitioners, pediatricians, and pediatric infectious disease specialists to ascertain their thoughts on vaccination during the pandemic. A majority of family practitioners stated that, despite hesitations, families brought their children for vaccination. They noted that vaccination should be emphasized, physicians should be supported by health authorities, and all related media and social media channels should be used to promote maintaining vaccinations. In contrast, pediatricians and pediatric infectious disease specialists were of the opinion that families were expressing greater hesitation and would not bring their children for vaccination. Vaccination rates in Ankara have decreased 2-5% during the pandemic, and the greatest decrease was observed for vaccines administered after 18 months of age.

Yet, many still struggle to attain their weight loss goals in such programmes. Little is understood about the factors which impact success in these programmes. Synthesising this data will allow for theory to be developed on how to improve success in such programmes. The main aim of this review will be to extract and synthesise the barriers and facilitators of successful weight loss during participation of behavioural weight loss programmes in adults living with overweight and obesity. METHODS A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library and CINAHL will be performed from inception onwards. Studies will also be sought by contacting experts in the field, reference and website searching. Studies will be eligible if the participants are adults living with obesity (population) undertaking or recently completed behavioural weight loss programmes (intervention) with the primary focus of weight loss (outcome). The primary outcomes will be amount of weight lost and information on barriers and/or facilitators to success. The secondary outcomes will be reasons or factors related to attrition and adherence and behaviour change techniques used in programmes. Two reviewers will screen citations and full-text data. Reviewer 1 will screen all, and reviewer 2 will screen a random 50% of articles. Data extraction will be completed by reviewer 1, and 10% will be checked by the research team. Potential conflicts will be resolved through discussion. Data will be synthesised and described narratively to show the characteristics of each study, levels of success and barriers and facilitators during programme participation. A thematic approach will be taken, and themes will be coded against the levels of the socioecological model. Quantitative data will be extracted and categorised according to these themes and presented alongside the qualitative data. DISCUSSION Our findings can be used to inform how weight loss programmes can be improved to facilitate success in those at risk of failure. Results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

METHODS Cross-sectional study of 533 adults aged ≥50 years with foot pain in the past year. Weightbearing dorso-plantar (DP) and lateral x-rays were taken of both feet. The La Trobe radiographic atlas was used to document the presence of osteophytes (OP) and joint space narrowing (JSN). Prevalence of OA in each joint was documented using both views and features in combination (as recommended in the original atlas), and by using a single view (DP or lateral only) and a single feature (OP or JSN only). RESULTS Compared to the recommended case definition based on OP and JSN using both views, a DP only view identified between 15 and 77% of OA cases, while a lateral only view identified between 28 and 97% of OA cases. Compared to the recommended case definition of using both features, using only OP identified between 46 and 94% of OA cases, while using only JSN identified between 19 and 76% of OA cases. CONCLUSION Applying the La Trobe radiographic atlas but using only one x-ray view (DP or lateral) or one feature (OP or JSN) in isolation misses a substantial number of OA cases, and the sensitivity of these approaches varies considerably between different foot joints. These findings indicate that, where possible, the atlas should be administered according to the original description to avoid under-ascertainment of radiographic foot OA.","Menz, Hylton B; Munteanu, Shannon E; Marshall, Michelle; Thomas, Martin J; Rathod-Mistry, Trishna; Peat, George M; Roddy, Edward",Arthritis care & research,87,7

Despite the great achievements of the existing point-of-care testing (POCT) technology, accurate on-site screening of oxalate remains a tricky issue. To this aim, we proposed a ""lab in a tube"" platform which integrated portable hydrogel kit with smartphone for real-time monitoring of oxalate to achieve quantitatively precise analysis. In this work, a stimuli-responsive hydrogel-based kit was constructed via embedding manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanosheets into sodium alginate hydrogel system. Based on the intrinsic oxidase-like activity, MnO2 nanosheets-based nanozyme triggered color reaction by introducing a common sensing probe 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine. Meanwhile, the presence of oxalate would decompose MnO2 nanosheets, inducing the decrease of nanozyme activity, which resulted in the color response of portable kit. Coupling with ImageJ software, the image information of kit captured via smartphone could be transduced into the hue intensity, which provided a directly quantitative tool to detect oxalate with a detection limit of 8.0 μmol L-1. This portable smartphone biosensor was successfully applied for screening urine sample within 10 min for high-throughput analysis (twelve samples) without the need for any advanced analytical instruments. Based on the merits of simple operation, cost-efficiency, and good selectivity, the availability of the miniaturized biosensor platform for POCT will achieve the requirements of routine screening and disease prevention.","Jin, Rui; Zhao, Lianjing; Yan, Xu; Han, Xiaosong; Liu, Mengqi; Chen, Yue; Li, Qingyun; Su, Dandan; Liu, Fangmeng; Sun, Peng; Liu, Xiaomin; Wang, Chenguang; Lu, Geyu",Biosensors & bioelectronics,87,1

Ideally, these virus-host protein interactions should be mapped directly in infected cell culture, but such a high standard is often difficult to reach when using conventional approaches. We thus developed a new strategy based on recombinant viruses expressing tagged viral proteins to capture both direct and indirect physical binding partners during infection. As a proof of concept, we engineered a recombinant measles virus (MV) expressing one of its virulence factors, the MV-V protein, with a One-STrEP amino-terminal tag. This allowed virus-host protein complex analysis directly from infected cells by combining modified tandem affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis. Using this approach, we established a prosperous list of 245 cellular proteins interacting either directly or indirectly with MV-V, and including four of the nine already known partners of this viral factor. These interactions were highly specific of MV-V because they were not recovered when the nucleoprotein MV-N, instead of MV-V, was tagged. Besides key components of the antiviral response, cellular proteins from mitochondria, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, protein phosphatase 2A, and histone deacetylase complex were identified for the first time as prominent targets of MV-V and the critical role of the later protein family in MV replication was addressed. Most interestingly, MV-V showed some preferential attachment to essential proteins in the human interactome network, as assessed by centrality and interconnectivity measures. Furthermore, the list of MV-V interactors also showed a massive enrichment for well-known targets of other viruses. Altogether, this clearly supports our approach based on reverse genetics of viruses combined with high-throughput proteomics to probe the interaction network that viruses establish in infected cells.","Komarova, Anastassia V; Combredet, Chantal; Meyniel-Schicklin, Laurène; Chapelle, Manuel; Caignard, Grégory; Camadro, Jean-Michel; Lotteau, Vincent; Vidalain, Pierre-Olivier; Tangy, Frédéric",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,87,17

The poliovirus RNA genome contains a sequence in its protein-coding region that can act as a competitive inhibitor of RNase L. Mutation, sequence, and functional analysis of this competitive inhibitor RNA (ciRNA) revealed that its activity depends on specific sequences, showed that a loop-loop hairpin interaction forms in the ciRNA, and suggested the presence of a loop E motif. These features lead to the hypothesis that the ciRNA's function is conferred in part by a specific three-dimensional folded RNA architecture. By using a combination of biophysical, mutational, and functional studies, we have mapped features of the three-dimensional architecture of the ciRNA in its unbound form. We show that the loop-loop interaction forms in the free ciRNA and affects the overall structure, perhaps forming long-range tertiary interactions with the loop E motif. Local tight RNA-RNA backbone packing occurs in parts of the structure, but the fold appears to be less stable than many other tightly packed RNAs. This feature may allow the ciRNA to accommodate the translocation of ribosomes and polymerase across this multifunctional region of the viral RNA but also to function as an RNase L inhibitor.","Keel, Amanda Y; Jha, Babal Kant; Kieft, Jeffrey S",RNA,87,24

These investigations require an adequate animal model. Our objective was to develop a reproducible survival model of LRYGB performed in a large animal at a tertiary university hospital. METHODS LRYGB was performed on 11 Yorkshire pigs that where then followed for 6 weeks. The operative time, morbidity, and mortality were recorded for each case. Necropsy was performed, and the anastomoses were harvested and inspected for leaks. RESULTS The surgical technique and difficulties are carefully described. Of the 11 pigs, 10 survived to the end of the study period. The 1 death was from intraoperative cardiac dysrhythmia. The postoperative complications consisted of a postoperative febrile episode in 2 pigs. The mean initial weight was 31.5 ± 3.4 kg. The mean operative time was 214 ± 71 minutes. No anastomotic leaks were identified at necropsy or on histologic examination of anastomoses. The mean weight gain at the end of the study period was .8 ± 1.4 kg compared with an expected 17.5 kg weight gain. CONCLUSION We have described an effective survival porcine model of LRYGB that can be consistently reproduced. This will enable additional investigation into the complex physiologic mechanisms that control hunger, weight loss, and the development, as well as resolution, of type 2 diabetes, potentially leading to the development of novel, targeted bariatric procedures and diabetic treatments.","Escareno, Cesar E; Azagury, Dan E; Flint, Richard S; Nedder, Arthur; Thompson, Christopher C; Lautz, David B",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,87,1

DESIGN Nonrandomized prospective study. SETTING University department of surgery. PATIENTS Sixty-four patients with gallstones and gallbladder polyps were enrolled after providing informed consent. Based on our experience, we excluded patients with acute cholecystitis, concomitant choledocholithiasis, a history of previous upper abdominal surgery, and a suspicion of gallbladder cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES We analyzed the outcomes and complications, based on our experience, according to the clinicopathologic and operative factors. We also compared patients who underwent single-incision multiport laparoscopic cholecystectomy with those who were converted to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. RESULTS There were 2 bile duct injuries and 4 surgical site infections. We had difficulties in visualizing the Calot triangle in 22 patients. Higher levels of inflammatory markers, longer operation times, and more frequent bile juice spillage were significantly observed in those patients. Ten patients were converted to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The mean age of patients who underwent conversion surgery was significantly older than that of the no-conversion group. The more the body mass index increased, the more the conversion rate increased. CONCLUSIONS Experienced laparoscopic surgeons can safely perform cholecystectomy using conventional and curved laparoscopic instruments in selected patients. We recommend that you consider performing conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy or that you use additional retraction devices for patients with a higher body mass index or acute cholecystitis.","Han, Hyung-Joon; Choi, Sae-Byeol; Kim, Wan-Bae; Choi, Sang-Yong",Archives of surgery,87,1

Few cases of disease-related cutaneous manifestations have been reported in the literature and such manifestations are scarce. Integumentary manifestations from COVID-19 include exanthemas and papular dermatoses, urticarial eruptions, atopic dermatitis, vesiculobullous lesions and skin signs of hypercoagulable states, such as acral ischemia, livedo and retiforme purpura. Most common extra cutaneous manifestations from the disease include headache, cough, anosmia, ageusia, fever, dyspnea, nausea, diarrhea and cardiovascular events. The objectives of this review are to discuss the role of human cell receptors described as interaction targets of SARS-CoV-2, as well to understand the current state of knowledge on skin expression of these receptors, in order to substantiate future research. The authors present a thorough literature review on SARS-CoV-2 and its possible interaction with cell receptors and human tissues including the skin. They discuss a molecular hypothesis to explain the lower prevalence of dermatological manifestations from direct SARS-CoV-2 infection. Distinct human cell receptors binding the virus appear to be less expressed in the skin compared to other organs. Additionally, the presence of resolvins and the desintegrin metalloprotease ADAM17 provide a putative protection to the skin, explaining the majority of COVID-19 manifestations to be extra cutaneous. This review represents an excellent opportunity for future studies using skin biopsies from COVID-19 patients to investigate molecular expression in the pathophysiology of cutaneous manifestations of the disease.","Criado, Paulo Ricardo; Pincelli, Thais Prota Hussein; Criado, Roberta Fachini Jardim; Abdalla, Beatrice Martinez Zugaib; Belda Junior, Walter",Experimental dermatology,87,16

However, decisions about its introduction should be supported by up-to-date evidence capable of providing an overview of available knowledge. OBJECTIVES To map the (a) state of research on massive open online courses in undergraduate and postgraduate health sciences education, (b) evaluation methods and tools used to measure learning outcomes, and (c) factors increasing their effectiveness as documented to date. DESIGN A rapid review following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines. METHODS PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane, Scopus, PsycInfo and Medline (via Ovid) were searched. Primary studies reporting one or more massive open online course (1) devoted to undergraduate and/or postgraduate students in nursing and healthcare sciences (2), written in English (3) with abstract available (4) and published up to February 18th, 2020 were all included. After having assessed the need for a review and the topic itself (a), the literature search was performed (b), studies were screened and selected (c), data was extracted (d), and the findings were summarised (e). RESULTS Thirty-six studies emerged with mainly an explorative/descriptive or case study design. The courses have been developed mainly by universities alone or in collaboration with institutions mainly in US, Sweden and the UK. Their delivery has been performed at multi-national levels, mainly in English, and with a number of participants ranging from 45 to >23,000. The duration spanned from two weeks to six months on clinical topics (e.g., emergency medicine) to methods (e.g., statistics). The target audience has been mainly mixed, including students, healthcare professionals, and lay citizens. Evaluation methods and tools have been described in 28 studies, and multiple-choice questions were most frequently adopted. Factors affecting the effectiveness of massive open online courses have been identified analysing the courses themselves and the participants. CONCLUSION Massive open online courses have recently started to be studied in healthcare sciences: these can be useful to educate students, mainly as elective courses, and to educate a massive audience, thus embodying the third mission of the university. The complexity of factors increasing effectiveness suggests the need for a multidisciplinary approach both in their design and implementation.","Longhini, Jessica; De Colle, Beatrice; Rossettini, Giaocmo; Palese, Alvisa",Nurse education today,87,1

In this paper, we describe the synthesis of a new partial inclusion complex of bis(1,10-phenanthroline)silver(I) salicylate in β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) which was synthesized with a good yield. The compounds were characterized by FTIR, 1H, 13C NMR including 1H-1H COSY, TGA/DSC, elemental analysis (CHN), and X-ray powder diffraction. The results suggest the presence of non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic interactions in the formation of the partial inclusion compound between β-CD and bis(1,10-phenanthroline)silver(I) salicylate [Ag(phen)2]salH. Additionally, an in silico prediction of 1,10-phenanthroline biological activities was carried out and the acquired data suggests several potential targets associated with the antimicrobial activity of this compound and its silver complex. Most predicted targets are related to antimicrobial virulence and resistance that are a serious threat to global public health.

Plasma samples of 121 sepsis patients and 60 healthy controls (HCs) were collected, then circ-PRKCI and miR-545 expressions were detected using RT-qPCR. Sepsis patients' demographics, biochemical indexes, medical histories, infection information were recorded. Besides, comprehensive disease scores (APACHE II score and SOFA score) were assessed within 24 h after admission. According to the survival status, 28-day mortality was calculated. Decreased circ-PRKCI expression and increased miR-545 expression were observed in sepsis patients compared to HCs, both of which had close correlations with sepsis risk. Besides, circ-PRKCI was negatively correlated with miR-545 in sepsis patients and HCs, respectively. Circ-PRKCI was negatively correlated with serum creatinine, white blood cell, C-reactive protein, APACHE II score, SOFA score, but positively correlated with albumin, which also related to blood stream infection (as primary infection site) and anaerobes infection in sepsis patients. Whereas the miR-545 showed a roughly opposite tendency. Decreased circ-PRKCI and increased miR-545 expressions were discovered in deaths compared to survivors, and both of them had values for predicting 28-day mortality risk in sepsis patients, which were slightly lower than the predictive values of APACHE II score and SOFA score for predicting 28-day mortality risk. Multivariate logistic analyses displayed circ-PRKCI as an independent factor predicting decreased 28-day mortality risk. In conclusion, circ-PRCKI insufficiency and miR-545 sufficiency were related to sepsis risk, clinical disease severity and 28-day mortality risk.","Wei, Bohua; Yu, Li",Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,87,31

To address the gaps in knowledge around citizen engagement in health research, we propose a scoping review to synthesize the state of knowledge on methods to incorporate and evaluate citizen engagement in research. A protocol is presented in this manuscript. METHODS The methodology for our scoping review is guided by Arksey and O' Malley's framework for scoping reviews, and additional recommendations by Levac and colleagues. We will include peer-reviewed and gray literature that report on citizen engagement in health research (including biomedical, clinical, health systems and services, and social, cultural, environmental and population health) and report method(s) to conduct, measure, or evaluate citizen engagement. We will systematically search electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, JSTOR, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Science Direct) from inception onwards and search relevant organizations' websites for additional studies, frameworks, and reports on citizen engagement. Title and abstract and full-text citations will be screened independently and in duplicate. Data will be extracted independently and in duplicate, including document characteristics, citizen engagement definitions and goals, and outcomes of citizen engagement (e.g., barriers, facilitators). DISCUSSION This review will synthesize the definitions, goals, methods, outcomes, and significance of citizen engagement in health research, as well as any potential barriers, facilitators, and challenges outlined in existing literature. The findings will provide an evidence-based foundation for developing new or improved guidance for citizen engagement in health research. Overall, we anticipate that our scoping review will be a preliminary step to meaningful engagement of citizens in research and strengthen the relationship between the scientific community and the public through transparency and collaboration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS To find the relationship between exposure to MERS-CoV and mortality rate due to SARS-CoV-2, we collected and analyzed data of three possible factors that may have resulted in an exposure of a population to MERS-CoV: (1) the number of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) cases reported among 16 countries since 2012; (2) data of MERS-CoV seroprevalence in camels across 23 countries, as working with camels increase risk of exposure to MERS-CoV; (3) data of travel history of people from 51 countries to Saudi Arabia was collected on the assumption that travel to a country where MERS is endemic, such as, Saudi Arabia, could also lead to exposure to MERS-CoV. RESULTS We found a significantly lower number of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths per million (deaths/M) of a population in countries that are likely to be exposed to MERS-CoV than otherwise (t-stat=3.686, p<0.01). In addition, the number of COVID-19 deaths/M of a population was significantly lower in countries that reported a higher seroprevalence of MERS-CoV in camels than otherwise (t-stat=4.5077, p<0.01). Regression analysis showed that increased travelling history to Saudi Arabia is likely to be associated with a lower mortality rate due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS This study provides empirical evidence that a population that was at an increased risk of exposure to MERS-CoV had a significantly lower mortality rate due to SARS-CoV-2, which might be due to cross-protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in that population because of an earlier exposure to MERS-CoV.","Naeem, U; Naeem, A; Naeem, M A; Naeem, K; Mujtaba, B; Mujtaba, A; Khurshid, A",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,87,16

DATA SOURCES PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science, and and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched for English language studies with no restrictions on date or location. Studies included randomized trials, prospective or retrospective cohort studies, and case-control studies of pregnant patients who developed atonic postpartum hemorrhage and reported at least one risk factor. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION Title, abstract, and full-text screening were performed using the Raayan web application. Of 1,239 records screened, 27 studies were included in this review. Adjusted or unadjusted odds ratios (ORs), relative risks, or rate ratios were recorded or calculated. For each risk factor, a qualitative synthesis of low and moderate risk of bias studies classifies the risk factor as definite, likely, unclear, or not a risk factor. For risk factors with sufficiently homogeneous definitions and reference ranges, a quantitative meta-analysis of low and moderate risk of bias studies was implemented to estimate a combined OR. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS Forty-seven potential risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage were identified in this review, of which 15 were judged definite or likely risk factors. The remaining 32 assessed risk factors showed no association with atonic postpartum hemorrhage or had conflicting or unclear evidence. CONCLUSION A substantial proportion of postpartum hemorrhage occurs in the absence of recognized risk factors. Many risk factors for atonic hemorrhage included in current risk-assessment tools were confirmed, with the greatest risk conferred by prior postpartum hemorrhage of any etiology, placenta previa, placental abruption, uterine rupture, and multiple gestation. Novel risk factors not currently included in risk-assessment tools included hypertension, diabetes, and ethnicity. Obesity and magnesium were not associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage in this review.

As of January 2020, only nine Pakistani institutions were providing formal EM specialty training; therefore, a training program of shorter duration is needed in the interim. Methods The Certification Program in Emergency Medicine (CPEM) is a 1-year training program in EM consisting of two arms: CPEM-Clinical (CPEM-C), which includes physicians from The Indus Hospital (TIH) ED, and CPEM-Didactic (CPEM-D), including physicians from EDs across Karachi. Both groups participate in weekly conferences, including didactics, small-group discussions, workshops, and journal clubs. CPEM-C learners also receive clinical mentorship from visiting international and TIH EM faculty. Both groups were assessed with preprogram, midterm, and final examinations as well as on clinical skills. Additionally, both groups provided regular feedback on program content and administration. Results Twenty-five of the 32 initially enrolled learners completed the program in June 2019. Scores on a matched set of 50 questions administered in the pretest and final examination improved by an average of 15.1% (p < 0.005) for CPEM-C learners and 8.5% (p < 0.0005) for CPEM-D learners, with 93% of learners showing improvement. Clinical evaluations of CPEM-C and CPEM-D learners during the first and fourth quarters showed an average improvement of 1.1 out of 5 (p < 0.05) and 1.2 out of 9 (p < 0.0005) points, respectively. Learner evaluations of the program were overall positive. Conclusions CPEM demonstrated significant improvement in test scores and clinical evaluations in both program arms. Evaluations also suggested that the program was well received. These data, along with CPEM's ability to train physicians from multiple institutions using low-cost, innovative educational strategies, suggest that it may be an effective, transferable mechanism for the expedited development of EM in Pakistan and countries where EM is developing as a specialty.","Kemmler, Charles B; Saleem, Syed Ghazanfar; Ali, Saima; Samad, Lubna; Haider, Kaniz F; Jamal, Mohammad I; Aziz, Tariq; Maroof, Quratulain; Dadabhoy, Farah Z; Yasin, Zayed; Rybarczyk, Megan M",AEM education and training,87,20

Hungarian Plain in August 2013. The concentrations of the semivolatile organic compounds (SOCs) in the soil were not correlated with the organic carbon content but with two indirect parameters of mineralization and aromaticity, suggesting that soil organic matter quality is an important parameter affecting the sorption of SOCs onto soils. Predictions based on the assumption that absorption is the dominant process were in good agreement with the measurements for PAHs, OCPs, and the low chlorinated PCBs. In general, soils were found to be a source of PAHs, high chlorinated PCBs, the majority of OCPs and PBDEs, and a sink for the low chlorinated PCBs and γ-hexachlorocyclohexane. Diurnal variations in the direction of the soil-air exchange were found for two compounds (i.e., pentachlorobenzene and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane), with volatilization during the day and deposition in the night.

We aimed to analyse the impact of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) burden on HT subtypes and outcome after intravenous thrombolysis. METHODS We retrospectively examined clinical and radiological data from 333 consecutive patients with acute ischaemic stroke who underwent susceptibility-weighted imaging before intravenous thrombolysis. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the impact of CMBs on HT subtypes and neurological outcome. RESULTS We observed 596 CMBs in 119 (39.7%) patients on initial gradient-recalled echo scans. HT occurred in 88 (29.3%) patients, among which 62 were haemorrhagic infarction and 26 were parenchymal haemorrhage (PH). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the presence of extensive (≥ 3) CMBs was independently associated with PH (OR 6.704; 95% CI 2.054 to 21.883; p = 0.002) and poor clinical outcome (OR 2.281; 95% CI 1.022 to 5.093; p = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS The presence of extensive (≥ 3) CMBs increased the risk of PH 24 h after intravenous thrombolysis, and predicted poor clinical outcome independently.","Yan, Shenqiang; Jin, Xinchun; Zhang, Xuting; Zhang, Sheng; Liebeskind, David S; Lou, Min","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",87,16

During this period of crisis, researchers over the world have ramped their efforts to constrain the disease in all possible ways whether it is vaccination, therapy, or diagnosis. Since the spread of the disease has not yet elapsed, sharing the ongoing research findings could be the key to disease control and management. An early and efficient diagnosis could leverage the outcome until a successful vaccine is developed. Both in-house and commercial kits are the preferred molecular tests being used worldwide in the COVID-19 diagnosis. However, the limitation of high prices and lengthy procedures impede their use for mass testing. Keeping the constant rise of infection in mind search for an alternative test that is cost-effective, simple, and suitable for large scale testing and surveillance is the need of the hour. One such alternative could be immunological tests. In the last few months, a deluge of immunological rapid tests have been developed and validated across the globe. The objective of the present review is to share the diagnostic performance of various immunological assays reported so far in SARS-CoV-2 case detection. We consolidate the studies (published and preprints) related to serological tests such as chemiluminescence, enzyme-linked and lateral flow-based point-of-care tests in COVID-19 diagnosis and update the current scenario.

Here, we report on the sero-prevalence of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), mayaro virus (MAYV) and zika virus (ZIKV) in a swamp community in Zambia. METHODS We collected blood and saliva samples from residents of Lukanga swamps in 2016 during a mass-cholera vaccination campaign. Over 10,000 residents were vaccinated with two doses of Shanchol™ during this period. The biological samples were collected prior to vaccination (baseline) and at specified time points after vaccination. We tested a total of 214 baseline stored serum samples for IgG antibodies against NS1 of DENV and ZIKV and E2 of CHIKV and MAYV on ELISA. We defined sero-prevalence as the proportion of participants with optical density (OD) values above a defined cut-off value, determined using a finite mixture model. RESULTS Of the 214 participants, 79 (36.9%; 95% CI 30.5-43.8) were sero-positive for Chikungunya; 23 (10.8%; 95% CI 6.9-15.7) for Zika, 36 (16.8%; 95% CI 12.1-22.5) for Dengue and 42 (19.6%; 95% CI 14.5-25.6) for Mayaro. Older participants were more likely to have Zika virus whilst those involved with fishing activities were at greater risk of contracting Chikungunya virus. Among all the antigens tested, we also found that Chikungunya saliva antibody titres correlated with baseline serum titres (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.222; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION Arbovirus transmission is occurring in Zambia. This requires proper screening tools as well as surveillance data to accurately report on disease burden in Zambia.","Chisenga, Caroline C; Bosomprah, Samuel; Musukuma, Kalo; Mubanga, Cynthia; Chilyabanyama, Obvious N; Velu, Rachel M; Kim, Young Chan; Reyes-Sandoval, Arturo; Chilengi, Roma",PloS one,87,5

Such determination is particularly challenging because NPs are extremely difficult to detect and quantify once distributed in a biological system. Radiolabelling with positron or gamma emitters and subsequent imaging studies using positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) are some of the few valid alternatives. However, NPs that degrade or radionuclides that detach or are released from the NPs can cause artefact. Here, submicron-sized poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) stabilised with bovine serum albumin (BSA) were dual radiolabelled using gamma emitters with different energy spectra incorporated into the core and coating. To label the core, 111In-doped iron oxide NPs were encapsulated inside PLGA-NPs during NP preparation, and the BSA coating was labelled by electrophilic substitution using 125I. After intravenous administration into rats, energy-discriminant SPECT resolved each radioisotope independently. Imaging revealed different fates for the core and coating, with a fraction of the two radionuclides co-localising in the liver and lungs for long periods of time after administration, suggesting that NPs are stable in these organs. Organ harvesting followed by gamma counting corroborated the SPECT results. The general methodology reported here represents an excellent alternative for visualising the degradation process of multi-labelled NPs in vivo and can be extended to a wide range of engineered NPs.","Llop, J; Jiang, P; Marradi, M; Gómez-Vallejo, V; Echeverría, M; Yu, S; Puigivila, M; Baz, Z; Szczupak, B; Pérez-Campaña, C; Mao, Z; Gao, C; Moya, S E",Journal of materials chemistry.

The existence of multiple memory systems appears to facilitate successful navigation across a wide range of environmental and physiological conditions. The mechanisms by which these systems interact to ultimately generate a unitary behavioral response, however, remain unclear. We trained 20 male, Sprague-Dawley rats on a dual-solution T-maze while simultaneously recording local field potentials that were targeted to the dorsolateral striatum and dorsal hippocampus. Eight rats spontaneously exhibited a place strategy while the remaining 12 rats exhibited a response strategy. Interindividual differences in behavioral strategy were associated with distinct patterns of LFP activity between the dorsolateral striatum and dorsal hippocampus. Specifically, striatal-hippocampal theta activity was in-phase in response rats and out-of-phase in place rats and response rats exhibited elevated striatal-hippocampal coherence across a wide range of frequency bands. These contrasting striatal-hippocampal activity regimes were (a) present during both maze-learning and a 30 min premaze habituation period and (b) could be used to train support vector machines to reliably predict behavioral strategy. Distinct patterns of neuronal activity across multiple memory systems, therefore, appear to bias behavioral strategy selection and thereby contribute to interindividual differences in behavior.","Goldenberg, Joshua E; Lentzou, Stergiani; Ackert-Smith, Lyn; Knowlton, Harrison; Dash, Michael B",Hippocampus,87,1

All patients had undergone conventional MRI before RFA. Uni- and multivariable analyses for LTP were assessing using a Cox proportional hazards model. The developed MRI-based nomogram was further designed based on multivariable logistic analysis in our study and the usefulness of the developed model was validated according to calibration curves and the C-index. Rim enhancement (hazard ratio: 2.689, P = .044) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values (hazard ratio: 0.055, P = .038) were statistically significant independent predictors of LTP after RFA at multivariable analysis. The performance of the nomogram incorporating two MRI parameters (with a C-index of 0.782) was improved compared with that based on rim enhancement and ADC alone (with C-index values of 0.630 and 0.728, respectively). The calibration curve of the MRI-based nomogram showed good conformance between evaluation and observation at 0.5, 1, and 1.5 years after RFA.

METHODS We studied the effects of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (pH1N1) infection on solid organ transplant recipients in our hospital, with emphasis on clinical information, duration of viral culture positivity, polymerase chain reaction positivity, effects of oseltamivir therapy, and graft status at 6 months of follow-up. RESULTS Twenty-two cases of pH1N1 infection involving 18 renal, two lung, one heart, and one liver transplant recipients were seen from July 14 to September 8, 2009. Their median age was 50.5 years (range 20-70 years); 64% were women, and median time posttransplant was 40 months (range 6-204 months). Common symptoms were fever (86%), cough (77%), sore throat (55%), phlegm (32%), and myalgia (27%). The median duration of symptoms (n=21) and duration of polymerase chain reaction positivity (n=15) were 7 (range 4-13 days) and 8 days (range 4-16 days), respectively. Mean (± SD) duration of symptom resolution (7.4 ± 3.0 vs. 7.8 ± 3.0 days, P=0.76) and viral culture positivity (5.3 ± 2.8 vs. 4.3 ± 3.2 days, P=0.65) did not differ between those who received a 5-day (n=9) or 10-day (n=12) course of oseltamivir. Five patients (22.7%) developed pneumonia with three needing intensive care. Mortality rate was 4.5% (1/22). At 6 months, three graft rejections involving two renal and one lung developed. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that the pH1N1 infection in solid organ transplant recipients is associated with some degree of morbidity and may affect the function of the transplanted organ. In this nonrandomized comparison, patients treated with 5 days of oseltamivir did not fare worse compared with those who received 10 days.","Low, Chian Yong; Kee, Terence; Chan, Kwai Peng; Oon, Lynette L E; Tan, Chee Kiat; Tee, Nancy W S; Tan, Ban Hock",Transplantation,87,1

RESULTS We propose a method to predict the putative ligand-receptor interactions between cell types from single cell RNA-sequencing data. This is achieved by inferring and incorporating interactions in a multidirectional graph, thereby enabling contextual exploratory analysis. We demonstrate that our approach can detect common and specific interactions between cell types in mouse brain and human tumors, and that these interactions fit with expected outcomes. These interactions also include predictions made with molecular ligands integrating information from several types of genes necessary for ligand production and transport. Our implementation is general and can be appended to any transcriptome analysis pipeline to provide unbiased hypothesis generation regarding ligand to receptor interactions between cell populations or for network analysis in silico.

Results 309 surveys were collected from 18 provinces of Argentina. 230(74.4%[69.1-79.1]) were answered by caregivers and 79(25.5%[20.7-30.7]) by people with disabilities. Persons with disabilities were 138(44.7%[39.0-50.4]) children and adolescents and 171(55.3%[49.5-60.9]) adults and older adults. People with disabilities were able to comply with the WHO recommendations regarding reducing exposure to COVID-19 and to be prepared in case of contracting it. There were difficulties in the number of caregivers needed, since 266(66.6%[61.0-71.8]) have this possibility, and difficulties in 55(32.1%[25.1-39.6]) adults and older adults that do not carry out educational-therapeutic activities. There are feelings of anxiety, distress, or depression in people with disabilities and their caregivers. Conclusion In Argentina, it is possible to comply with the WHO recommendations to avoid exposure to the virus and to be prepared in case of infection. Challenges remain to be solved in terms of accompanying people with disabilities in their physical and mental health.","Ruiz Brunner, Maria de Las Mercedes; Escobar Zuluaga, L Johana; Cieri, María Elisabeth; Condinanzi, Ana Laura; Cuestas, Eduardo",Revista de la Facultad de Ciencias Medicas,87,29

Immunizing the billions of people at risk for COVID-19 in the world's low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) still relies on the availability of vaccines produced and scaled through traditional technology approaches. Vaccines based on whole inactivated virus (WIV) and protein-based platforms, as well as protein particle-based vaccines, are the most produced by LMIC vaccine manufacturing strategies. Three major WIV vaccines are beginning to be distributed widely. Several protein-based and protein particle-based vaccines are advancing with promising results. Overall, these vaccines are exhibiting excellent safety profiles and in some instances have shown their potential to induce high levels of virus neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses (and protection) both in nonhuman primates and in early studies in humans. There is an urgent need to continue accelerating these vaccines for LMICs in time to fully vaccinate these populations by the end of 2022 at the latest. Achieving these goals would also serve as an important reminder that we must continue to maintain expertise in producing multiple vaccine technologies, rather than relying on any individual platform.

METHODS This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical and family data of 108 children who underwent congenital heart surgery and underwent remote follow-up via the WeChat platform from December 2019 to March 2020 in our hospital. RESULTS During the follow-up period, the WeChat platform was used to refer 8 children with respiratory infection symptoms to local hospitals for treatment. Two children with poor incision healing were healed after we used the WeChat platform to guide the parents in dressing the wounds on a regular basis at home. Nutritional guidance was given via the WeChat platform to 13 patients with poor growth and development. The psychological evaluation results of the parents showed that the median (range) SDS score was 43 (34-59), and 7 parents (6.5%) were classified as depressed; the median (range) SAS score was 41 (32-58), and 12 parents (11.1%) were classified as having mild anxiety. CONCLUSION The use of WeChat-based telehealth services was effective for the remote postoperative follow-up of children who underwent congenital cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 epidemic. Providing WeChat-based telehealth services can reduce the amount of travel required for these children and their families, which is helpful for controlling and preventing the spread of COVID-19.","Zhang, Qi-Liang; Huang, Shu-Ting; Xu, Ning; Wang, Zeng-Chun; Cao, Hua; Chen, Qiang",Brazilian journal of cardiovascular surgery,87,1

However, it often decreases the spatial resolution. The ability of high spatial resolution kernels (harder kernels) to compensate for the decrease in the spatial resolution of hybrid IRs was investigated. METHODS An elliptic cylindrical phantom simulating an adult abdomen was used. Two types of rod-shaped objects with ~330 and ~130 HU were inserted to simulate contrasts of arteries in CT angiography. Two multi-slice CT systems were used to scan the phantoms with 120 kVp and scan doses of 20 and 10 mGy. The task transfer functions (TTFs) were measured from the circular edges of the rod images. The noise power spectrum (NPS) was measured from the images of the water-only section. The CT images were reconstructed using a filtered back projection (FBP) with baseline kernels and two levels of hybrid IRs with harder kernels. The profiles of the clinical images across the aortic dissection flaps were measured to evaluate actual spatial resolutions. RESULTS The TTF degradation of each hybrid IR was recovered by the harder kernels, whereas the noise reduction effect was retained, for both the 20 and 10 mGy. The profiles of the dissection flaps for the FBP were maintained by using the harder kernels. Even with the best combination of hybrid IR and harder kernel, the noise level at 10 mGy was not reduced to the level of FBP at 20 mGy, suggesting no capability of a 50% dose reduction while maintaining noise.","Sugisawa, Koichi; Ichikawa, Katsuhiro; Urikura, Atsushi; Minamishima, Kazuya; Masuda, Shota; Hoshino, Takashi; Nakahara, Akiko; Yamada, Yoshitake; Jinzaki, Masahiro",Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics,87,1

The website of the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry(www.chictr.org.cn) and the American Clinical Trial Registry(clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to collect protocols of TCM for COVID-19. Documents were screened following the inclusion criteria, and data were extracted in regard to registration date, study objective, type of design, sponsor, patient, sample size, intervention, and evaluation index. Descriptive analysis was conducted. A total of 49 clinical trial protocols of TCM for COVID-19 were included. Primary sponsors were mainly hospitals or universities in places like Hubei, Beijing, Zhejiang and other regions. The implementation units are mainly in Hubei, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan and other regional hospitals. The types of study design were mainly experimental studies(40), including 30 randomized parallel controlled trials, 7 non-randomized controlled trials, 2 single arm trials and 1 consecutively recruited trial; besides, there were also 6 observational studies, 2 health service studies and 1 preventive study. The sample size reached a total of 30 562 cases, with a maximum of 20 000 for a single study and a minimum of 30.

METHODS A full-thickness excision is made on the rectal wall down to the perirectal fatty tissue. The specimen is retrieved transanally. After the parietal defect is disinfected, the wound is closed with one or more running sutures secured with silver clips. RESULTS Peritoneal perforation during TEM is not associated with adverse short-term or oncologic outcomes. The postoperative morbidity rate ranges between 2 % and 15 %, and in most cases, complications can be conservatively managed. The local recurrence rate of large adenomas is about 6 %, and most recurrences can be safely re-resected by TEM. TEM represents an effective treatment for pT1 sm1 rectal malignancies, while pT1 sm2-3 and pT2 should be considered at high risk of recurrence if treated by TEM alone. Finally, TEM does not influence anorectal function or quality of life. CONCLUSION TEM is a safe procedure and provides excellent functional and oncologic outcomes in the treatment of large sessile benign rectal lesions and selected early rectal cancers.","Allaix, Marco E; Arezzo, Alberto; Arolfo, Simone; Caldart, Mario; Rebecchi, Fabrizio; Morino, Mario",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,87,5

The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of long-acting octreotide (Sandostatin LAR) for the treatment of thymic tumors, with a primary efficacy end point of progression-free survival. METHODS Between 1994 and 2010, 44 patients with thymic malignancies were evaluated. Twenty-seven patients underwent an OctreoScan, and 12 OctreoScan-positive patients were treated with long-acting octreotide at a dose of 20 mg, given as an intramuscular injection, every 2 weeks. RESULTS Treatment with long-acting octreotide gave the following results: 3 cases of partial response (25%), 5 cases of stable disease (42%), and 4 cases of progressive disease (33%), with an average progression-free survival of 8 months (range, 3 to 21). Treatment compliance and tolerability were good for all evaluated patients. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study confirm the somatostatin receptor as a valid target for the treatment of thymic malignancies. Overall, therapy with long-acting somatostatin analogs seems to be safe and effective.","Longo, Flavia; De Filippis, Lucilla; Zivi, Andrea; Vitolo, Domenico; Del Signore, Ester; Gori, Bruno; Diso, Daniele; Anile, Marco; Venuta, Federico; De Giacomo, Tiziano; Coloni, Camillo Furio",American journal of clinical oncology,87,5

To do it, however, is essential that the dye molecules adsorb onto the metal oxide surface. Thus, optimizing the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent increases the probability of reaction between oxidation radicals and organic dye molecules and maximizes the effectiveness per gram of photocatalyst. With this in mind, we studied the adsorption behavior of Methylene Blue (MB) and Acid Orange 7 (AO7), two commonly found pollutants, as a function of dilution's pH, WO3 load, and initial dye concentration. We found out that WO3 adsorbs up to 80% of MB at pH=6, and 13% of AO7 at pH=2, although it is unable to adsorb AO7 at the natural pH of the dye dilution. Assuming a pseudo-second order kinetics model for the analysis of the MB adsorption amount, we determined a rate constant k2 = 6 × 10-2(g · mg-1)/min for the adsorption process. We put forward a molecular model for adsorption, driven by concentration gradients and electrostatic interactions. Finally, from a statistical analysis, we determined that pH is the most significant factor for the adsorption of MB and AO7 on WO3, reinforcing the notion that electrostatic interactions are the main mechanism driving the adsorption process. The Box-Behnken design optimization also evinces the key playing role of WO3 load in the adsorption percentage of AO7 and let us establish the optimal load required to maximize adsorption.","Arteaga-Jiménez, A; Trejo-Perez, M G; García-García, A L; González-Jasso, E; Vidales-Hurtado, M A",Environmental technology,87,5

METHODS Members of the Southeastern Surgical Congress were surveyed regarding system adjustments, personal impact, and productivity losses. Subgroups were analyzed for disproportionate impact across practice models (academic/employed/private), practice communities (urban, suburban, rural), and practice case-mix categories (broad general surgery, narrow general surgery, specialty practice, hospital-based practice). RESULTS 135 respondents reported that 98.5% of surgeons and 97% of hospitals canceled elective cases. Practices and hospitals reduced staffing dramatically. Telemedicine was utilized by most respondents. Hospitals variably implemented system changes, developed tests, and set up diagnostic centers. Most surgeons anticipated resumption of practice and hospital activity by July 1, 2020. More than one-quarter reported worsened financial status and personal well-being. Interestingly, family/personal relationships were improved in more than one-third. Most surgeons anticipate reduced year-end case volumes, clinical productivity, and salary. In subgroup analyses, academic surgeons were more likely than employed and private-practice surgeons to use telemedicine and to work in hospitals with in-house COVID-19 testing. Private-practice surgeons expected decreased financial status, case volumes, relative value units (RVUs), and salary. More rural surgeons anticipate reduced salary than urban and suburban surgeons. Surgeons in narrow general surgery practice reported more furlough of employees than specialty surgeons, hospital-based surgeons, and broad-based general surgeons. Narrow-practice surgeons and specialists were more likely to report RVU reductions and improved family/personal relationships. DISCUSSION The COVID-19 slowdown affected surgeons throughout the southeastern United States.

Health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of infection because the virus is highly contagious and can be transmitted by a variety of routes. Health care workers are required to use a variety of personal protective equipment (PPE) for prolonged hours and, as a result, they face varying degrees of cutaneous complications. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional online questionnaire survey to investigate skin problems caused by the use of PPE and personal hygiene measures. We developed a survey with 32 questions using Google forms and distributed it via WhatsApp and Facebook groups. RESULTS A total of 1142 responses were obtained. Among the respondents, 88.1% reported adverse skin reactions due to PPE and personal hygiene measures. Female sex, working as a nurse, wearing PPE more than 6 hours per day, and working more than 3 days per week increase the risk of PPE-related skin problems. CONCLUSION In this study, we highlighted skin problems related to personal protective equipment and found out risk factors for PPE-related skin problems.","Etgu, Fatma; Onder, Sevda",Cutaneous and ocular toxicology,87,13

Here, we describe an approach exploiting natural albumin transport across the airway epithelium to enhance mucosal TRM generation by vaccination. Pulmonary immunization with albumin-binding amphiphile conjugates of peptide antigens and CpG adjuvant (amph-vaccines) increased vaccine accumulation in the lung and mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs). Amph-vaccines prolonged antigen presentation in MLNs over 2 weeks, leading to 25-fold increased lung-resident T cell responses over traditional immunization and enhanced protection from viral or tumor challenge. Mimicking such prolonged exposure through repeated administration of soluble vaccine revealed that persistence of both antigen and adjuvant was critical for optimal TRM induction, mediated through T cell priming in MLNs after prime, and directly in the lung tissue after boost. Thus, vaccine persistence strongly promotes TRM induction, and amph-conjugates may provide a practical approach to achieve such kinetics in mucosal vaccines.","Rakhra, Kavya; Abraham, Wuhbet; Wang, Chensu; Moynihan, Kelly D; Li, Na; Donahue, Nathan; Baldeon, Alexis D; Irvine, Darrell J",Science immunology,87,11

In Experiment 1, heifers were randomly allocated to four groups: Control (n = 84): prostaglandin F2α (PGF) IM on Day 0; FA-5/GnRH (n = 43): FA 5 days before PGF and GnRH on Day 2; FA-4/GnRH (n = 48):FA 4 days before PGF and GnRH on Day 2; andFA-3/GnRH (n = 21): FA 3 days before PGF and GnRH on Day 2. Ultrasonography was performed to determine follicular size, ovulation occurrence, and size of CL. In Experiment 2, heifers were assigned to three groups: Control (n = 264), FA-5/GnRH, and FA-4/GnRH. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed at Days 30 and 60. In Experiment 1, size of largest follicle at time of PGF was less variable (P ≤ 0.05) in all FA groups compared to the Control group. With the FA-5/GnRH and FA-4/GnRH treatments, there were greater (P ≤ 0.05) proportions of timing of ovulation synchronization (86 % and 85 %, respectively) compared to the Control (61 %) and FA-3/GnRH (62 %) groups. In Experiment 2, conception rates did not differ among groups, however, there were more pregnancies per cow when timing-of-ovulation treatments were imposed. In conclusion, follicular ablation combined with GnRH treatment resulted in an increased proportion of heifers having synchronized ovulation and, therefore, number of recipient heifers available for embryo transfer. Additionally, there was no effect on conception rate when there was greater synchronization in timing of ovulation among heifers.","Manuel Palomino, J; Grand, François-Xavier; Vigneault, Christian; Blondin, Patrick; Sirard, Marc-André",Animal reproduction science,87,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS A cadaver study was performed to investigate the manifestations of internal hernias and mesenteric vascularization. Furthermore, a prospective, ethics approved study with retrospective interpretation was conducted. Ten patients, clinically suspected for internal herniation, were prospectively included. After informed consent was obtained, these subjects underwent abdominal CT examination, including additional arterial phase CTA. All subjects underwent diagnostic laparoscopy for suspected internal herniation. The CTA was used to create a 3D reconstruction of the mesenteric arteries and surgical staples (3D CTA). The 3D CTA was interpreted, taking into account the presence and type of internal hernia that was found upon laparoscopy. RESULTS Cadaveric analysis demonstrated the complexity of internal herniation. It also confirmed the expected changes in vascular structure and surgical staple arrangement in the presence of internal herniation. 3D CTA studies of the subjects with active internal hernias demonstrated remarkable differences when compared to control 3D CTA studies. The blood supply of herniated intestinal limbs in particular showed abnormal trajectories. Additionally, enteroenterostomy staple lines had migrated or altered orientation. CONCLUSION 3D CTA is a promising technique for diagnosing active internal hernias. Our findings suggest that for diagnosing internal hernias, focus should probably shift from routine abdominal CT examination towards the 3D assessment of the mesenteric vasculature and surgical staples.","Klop, Cornelis; Deden, Laura N; Aarts, Edo O; Janssen, Ignace M C; Pijl, Milan E J; van den Ende, Anneline; Witteman, Bart P L; de Jong, Gabie M; Aufenacker, Theo J; Slump, Cornelis H; Berends, Frits J",Obesity surgery,87,1

We sought to evaluate the mechanism of lumen gain when using the JETSTREAM Atherectomy System to treat calcified peripheral artery lesions. METHODS AND RESULTS The JETSTREAM Calcium Study was a prospective, single-arm, multicentre study to evaluate the JETSTREAM Atherectomy System for severely calcified femoral-popliteal artery lesions, i.e., patients with claudication and lesions with superficial calcium >90° and >5 mm in length as determined by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). The 2.1 mm catheter was used in this study without distal protection. Fifty-five patients underwent angiographic screening: 26 (45%) met IVUS inclusion criteria. Angiographic calcium was moderate in eight cases and severe in 14, with no available data for four cases. Visual diameter stenosis was 86±9% pre-treatment, 37±13% post atherectomy, and 10±6% post adjunctive treatment (adjunctive PTA+stenting in eight and adjunct PTA alone in 16). IVUS showed lumen area increased from 6.6±3.7 mm2 to 10.0±3.6 mm2 (p=0.001): calcium reduction was responsible for 86±23% of the lumen increase. Although the superficial calcium arc did not change (151±70° to 146±71°, p=0.83), the arc of reverberation increased (23±20° to 65±40°, p=0.006), indicating device-related modification of calcium. Adjunctive balloon angioplasty was performed in 62% of the lesions, and stent implantation in 31%. In 11 cases with adjunctive balloon dilation, the MLA increased from 7.1 (6.4, 7.8) mm2 post atherectomy to 11.9 (10.3, 13.5) mm2 post balloon (p<0.001) without flow-limiting dissection.

One particular issue that warrants further characterization is the hazards associated with chemical additives within micro(nano)plastic as they are not chemically bound within the polymers and can be persistent and biologically active. Most plastics contain additives and are therefore potential vectors for the introduction of these chemicals into the environment as they leach from plastic, a process that can be accelerated through degradation and weathering processes. There are knowledge gaps on the ecotoxicological effects of plastic additives and how they are released from parent plastic materials as they progressively fragment from the meso to micro and nano scale. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge of the ecotoxicity of plastic additives and identifies research needs to characterize the hazard they present to exposed biota. The potential ecological risk of chemical additives is of international concern so key differences in governance between the European Union and New Zealand to appropriately characterize their risk are highlighted.","Barrick, Andrew; Champeau, Olivier; Chatel, Amélie; Manier, Nicolas; Northcott, Grant; Tremblay, Louis A",PeerJ,87,15

Here, we reveal that first exposure to the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus recalls memory B cells that are specific to the conserved receptor-binding site (RBS) or lateral patch epitopes of the hemagglutinin (HA) head domain. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) generated against these epitopes are broadly neutralizing against H1N1 viruses spanning 40 years of viral evolution and provide potent protection in vivo. Lateral patch-targeting antibodies demonstrated near universal binding to H1 viruses, and RBS-binding antibodies commonly cross-reacted with H3N2 viruses and influenza B viruses. Lateral patch-targeting mAbs were restricted to expressing the variable heavy-chain gene VH3-23 with or without the variable kappa-chain gene VK1-33 and often had a Y-x-R motif within the heavy-chain complementarity determining region 3 to make key contacts with HA. Moreover, lateral patch antibodies that used both VH3-23 and VK1-33 maintained neutralizing capability with recent pH1N1 strains that acquired mutations near the lateral patch. RBS-binding mAbs used a diverse repertoire but targeted the RBS epitope similarly and made extensive contacts with the major antigenic site Sb. Together, our data indicate that RBS- and lateral patch-targeting clones are abundant within the human memory B cell pool, and universal vaccine strategies should aim to drive antibodies against both conserved head and stalk epitopes.","Guthmiller, Jenna J; Han, Julianna; Li, Lei; Freyn, Alec W; Liu, Sean T H; Stovicek, Olivia; Stamper, Christopher T; Dugan, Haley L; Tepora, Micah E; Utset, Henry A; Bitar, Dalia J; Hamel, Natalie J; Changrob, Siriruk; Zheng, Nai-Ying; Huang, Min; Krammer, Florian; Nachbagauer, Raffael; Palese, Peter; Ward, Andrew B; Wilson, Patrick C",Science translational medicine,87,1

OBJECTIVE Identify VADs implanted, catheter related thrombosis (CRT), catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), and accidental remove of VADs in both COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 free patients. Successive analysis was conducted comparing COVID-19 positive patients with COVID-19 free with inverse probability propensity score weights using simple regression to account for these two confounders (peripheral tip as central/peripheral and hospitalization as no/yes). METHODS This multicenter, retrospective cohort study collected data from seven hospitals in Lombardy during the pandemic period from February 21st to May 31st 2020. RESULTS A total of 2206 VADs were evaluated, 1107 (50.2%) of which were inserted in COVID-19 patients. In COVID-19 cohort the first choice was Long Peripheral Cannula in 388 patients (35.1%) followed by Midline Catheter in 385 (34.8%). The number of ""central tip"" VADs inserted in COVID-free inpatients and COVID-19 positive were similar (307 vs 334). We recorded 42 (1.9%) CRT; 32 (79.2%) were observed in COVID-19 patients. A total of 19 CRBSI were diagnosed; 15 (78.95%) were observed in COVID-19. Accidental removals were the more represented complication with 123 cases, 85 (69.1%) of them were in COVID-19. COVID-19 significantly predicted occurrence of CRT (OR = 2.00(1.85-5.03); p < 0.001), CRSB (OR = 3.82(1.82-8.97); p < 0.001), and Accidental Removal (OR = 2.39(1.80-3.20); p < 0.001) in our propensity score weighted models. CONCLUSIONS CRT, CRBSI, and accidental removal are significantly more frequent in COVID-19 patients. Accidental removals are the principal complication, for this reason, the use of subcutaneously anchored securement is recommended for a shorter period than usual.","Antonio, Gidaro; Davide, Vailati; Marco, Gemma; Francesca, Lugli; Francesco, Casella; Chiara, Cogliati; Antonio, Canelli; Cremonesi, Nadia; Davide, Monolo; Giuseppe, Cordio; Chiara, Frosi; Riccardo, Destefanis; Anna, Rossi; Maria Chiara, Alemanno; Franco, Valenza; Mara Dina, Luisoni; Stefano, Elli; Andrea, Caldarini; Alberto, Lucchini; Stefano, Paglia; Monica, Baroni; Davide, Giustivi",The journal of vascular access,87,1

Methods Consecutive RRHL patients who were treated with the VIBE regimen were identified and studied for clinicopathologic characteristics, response to VIBE regimen, event-free survival (EFS), and feasibility of an autologous stem-cell transplant (autoSCT). Results In total, 24 patients received the VIBE regimen, and a median of 3 cycles were administered. In this cohort, 80% of the patients had received ≥2 prior lines of therapy. The overall and complete response rates with VIBE were 79% and 42%, respectively. After a median follow-up (following VIBE regimen) of 14 months (range, 3-76), the 3-year EFS and OS were 46% and 74%, respectively. Of the eligible patients, 92% underwent successful AutoSCT. The mean CD34+ cell count in the autograft was 5.5×106/kg (SD 2.07). Neutropenia was the commonest hematologic toxicity; it was observed in 42% of patients. However, only 9% of the patients developed grade III/IV febrile neutropenia. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting were the second most common grade III/IV toxicity in our cohort of patients. Conclusion In this retrospective analysis, the combination regimen, VIBE, has shown good efficacy in heavily pre-treated patients with RRHL without compromising stem cell collection.

Here, we present the final analysis outcomes. METHODS A prospective, multicenter, non-interventional study involving patients who received tolvaptan for the treatment of liver cirrhosis with hepatic edema with an insufficient response to conventional diuretics. The observation period was up to 6 months. Effectiveness evaluation included changes in body weight and clinical symptoms. Safety analysis included evaluation of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). RESULTS Case reports of 1111 patients were collected. Of these, 1109 were included in the safety analysis and 1098 in the effectiveness analysis. The mean age was 69.4 ± 11.5 years and 695 (62.7%) patients were male. After tolvaptan treatment, a decrease in body weight from baseline was - 2.6 ± 2.7 kg on day 7 and - 3.8 ± 4.1 kg on day 14. Moreover, clinical symptoms significantly improved over the 14-day treatment. Frequently reported ADRs were thirst (6.6%), hepatic encephalopathy (2.3%), dehydration (1.5%), and hypernatremia (1.2%). A serum sodium level of ≥ 150 mEq/L was reported in five patients (0.5%). Multivariate analyses showed that the baseline blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level (cut-off value: 22.4 mg/dL) was the predictive factor for tolvaptan treatment response. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that tolvaptan was effective and well-tolerated in liver cirrhosis patients with hepatic edema. In the real-world clinical setting, tolvaptan provides a useful option for the treatment of hepatic edema.","Sakaida, Isao; Terai, Shuji; Kurosaki, Masayuki; Okada, Mitsuru; Hirano, Takahiro; Fukuta, Yasuhiko",Journal of gastroenterology,87,29

This effect was seen both when the barrier took a physical form and when it was purely symbolic. However, the mere presence of a barrier did not reduce cheating: if it failed to separate children from a space that was associated with cheating, children cheated as much as when there was no barrier at all.

The translation of these signals into tissue-specific responses is crucial for metamorphosis, but the mechanisms that confer specificity to systemic ecdysone pulses are far from understood. Here, we identify Bric-à-brac 2 (Bab2) as an ecdysone-responsive transcriptional repressor that controls temporal gene expression during larval to pupal transition. Bab2 is necessary to terminate Salivary gland secretion (Sgs) gene expression, while premature Bab2 expression blocks Sgs genes and causes precocious salivary gland histolysis. The timely expression of bab2 is controlled by the ecdysone-responsive transcription factor Broad, and manipulation of EcR/USP/Broad signaling induces inappropriate Bab2 expression and termination of Sgs gene expression. Bab2 directly binds to Sgs loci in vitro and represses all Sgs genes in vivo. Our work characterizes Bab2 as a temporal regulator of somatic gene expression in response to systemic ecdysone signaling.","Duan, Jianli; Zhao, Yunpo; Li, Haichao; Habernig, Lukas; Gordon, Michael D; Miao, Xuexia; Engström, Ylva; Büttner, Sabrina",Cell reports,87,1

STUDY DESIGN Saturation data in 2-second sampling from pulse oximeters was prospectively collected in a single NICU. Average SaO2, low and high saturation events, duration of events, and percentage of time infants spent outside of oxygen saturation range were collected and analyzed continuously during the hospitalization. RESULTS 102 infants <1500g or <32 weeks gestation were enrolled. There were 125, 112, and 43 hypoxia events/day and 106, 80, and 34 hyperoxia events/day for tROP (N=8), non-survivor (N=16) and non-tROP patients (N=78), respectively. Infants were outside saturation targets for 2:35, 1:38, and 1:03 (hypoxia) and 2:02, 1:25, and 0:38 hours/day (hyperoxia) for tROP, non-survivor and non-tROP, respectively. Time spent outside saturation range (hypoxia, hyperoxia and total time) for the hospital course was higher in tROP (P≤0.006) and non-survivor (P≤0.005) compared with non-tROP patients.

Additionally, we attempted to examine sources of variance in the prevalence and effect sizes of bullying in students with ASD across studies. Systematic database and literature review identified 34 relevant studies (31 for Western countries, three for Eastern countries). Pooled prevalence estimates for victimization, perpetration, and perpetration-victimization in general were 67%, 29%, and 14%, respectively. The risk of victimization in students with ASD was significantly higher than that in typically developing students and students with other disabilities. Further, deficits in social interaction and communication, externalizing symptoms, internalizing symptoms, and integrated inclusive school settings were related to higher victimization, and externalizing symptoms were related to higher perpetration. Finally, moderation analyses revealed significant variations in the pooled prevalences thereof depending on culture, age, school settings, and methodological quality and in the pooled effect sizes according to publication year and methodological quality. Our results highlight needs for bullying intervention for students with ASD, especially those who are younger, are in an inclusive school setting, and have higher social difficulties and externalizing/internalizing symptoms; for intensive research of bullying experiences among students with ASD in Eastern countries; and for efforts to improve the methodological quality of such research.","Park, Inhwan; Gong, Jared; Lyons, Gregory L; Hirota, Tomoya; Takahashi, Michio; Kim, Bora; Lee, Seung Yeon; Kim, Young Shin; Lee, Jeongsoo; Leventhal, Bennett L",Yonsei medical journal,87,24

Our study aims to analyze Hg accumulation in Loligo forbesi caught in the Azores Archipelago (Portugal) quantifying Hg in different tissues (mantle and stomach), as well in the squid stomach content, in order to evaluate the efficiency of Hg transfer from prey to predator. Hg data from the tissues was used to estimate the weekly tolerable Hg intake due to squid consumption. Overall data indicate that Hg measured in the stomach tissue (0.1 ± 0.01 μg g-1) was significantly higher than Hg levels found in the mantle (0.04 ± 0.001 μg g-1) and stomach contents (0.01 ± 0.001 μg g-1). BMF (bioaccumulation factor) was >1 for all the samples, indicating a biomagnification process from prey to predator. Hg concentration in the mantle tissue was correlated with mantle size; although females present higher Hg levels than males, the difference was found to be not related to gender but rather to the fact that females had larger bodies. Finally, considering the Hg concentration found in the mantle and the permitted Hg levels, it is advisable to consume up to 1050-1890g of squid per week, according to the regulatory agencies. Thus, our results indicate that, since these doses are respected, consumption of squids from the Azorean waters do not pose a risk to humans.","Vieira, H C; Rendón-von Osten, J; Soares, A M V M; Morgado, F; Abreu, S N",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,87,19

AIM/METHODS To investigate the role of innate immune detection of flagellin irrespective of adaptive immunity, we examined the consequences of loss of toll-like receptor 5 (T5) and/or Nod-like receptor 4 (N4) upon a Rag1-deficient background. RESULTS Mice lacking TLR5 and Rag1 (T5/Rag-DKO) exhibited frequent lethal Pasteurellaceae-containing abscesses that prevented breeding of these mice. Mice lacking TLR5, NLRC4, and Rag1 (T5/N4/Rag-TKO) also resulted in sporadic lethal abdominal abscesses caused by similar Pasteurellaceae. In the absence of such infections, relative to Rag1-KO, T5/N4/Rag-TKO mice exhibited microbiota encroachment, low-grade inflammation, microbiota dysbiosis, and, moreover were highly prone to Citrobacter infection and developed severe colitis when adoptively transferred with colitogenic T-cells. Relative proneness of T5/N4/Rag-TKO mice to T-cell colitis was ablated by antibiotics while fecal microbiota transplant from T5/N4/Rag-TKO mice to WT mice transferred proneness to Citrobacter infection, indicating that dysbiosis in T5/N4/Rag-TKO mice contributed to these phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate a critical role for innate immune detection of flagellin, especially in the intestinal tract and particularly in hosts deficient in adaptive immunity.","Zou, Jun; Zhao, Xu; Shi, Zhenda; Zhang, Zhan; Vijay-Kumar, Matam; Chassaing, Benoit; Gewirtz, Andrew T",The Journal of infectious diseases,87,16

Electrophysiological data has suggested MUs located superficially are larger than those located deeper within young muscle. However, the effects of ageing and exercise on MU heterogeneity across deep and superficial aspects of vastus lateralis (VL) remain unclear. Intramuscular electromyography was used to record individual MU potentials (MUPs) and near fibre MUPs (NFMs) from deep and superficial regions of the VL during 25% maximum voluntary contractions, in 83 males (15 young (Y), 17 young athletes (YA), 22 old (O) and 29 master athletes (MA)). MUP size and complexity were assessed using area and number of turns, respectively. Multilevel mixed effects linear regression models were performed to investigate the effects of depth in each group. MUP area was greater in deep compared with superficial MUs in Y (p<0.001) and O (p=0.012) but not in YA (p=0.071) or MA (p=0.653). MUP amplitude and NF MUP area were greater, and MUPs were more complex in deep MUPs from Y, YA and O (all p<0.05) but did not differ across depth in MA (all p>0.07). These data suggest MU characteristics differ according to depth within the VL which may be influenced by both ageing and exercise. A more homogenous distribution of MUP size and complexity across muscle depths in older athletes may be a result of a greater degree of age-related MU adaptations.","Jones, Eleanor J; Piasecki, Jessica; Ireland, Alex; Stashuk, Daniel W; Atherton, Philip J; Phillips, Bethan E; McPhee, Jamie S; Piasecki, Mathew",GeroScience,87,27

Infections are still on the rise, and the impact on the global death rate could be devastating. There are fears over the likely impact of a large number of deaths on body sourcing and handling of cadavers for teaching and research. Historically, epidemics come with several challenges and have often led to some level of negligence of ethical practices and health and safety regulations associated with body sourcing and handling. The authors highlighted some emerging problems in this article, focusing on Africa and Nigeria in particular. These problems include a higher risk of coronavirus exposure for body handlers, shortage of cadavers for teaching and learning, a lack of standard regulations leading to unethical body sourcing and handling, and a lack of monitoring and collaboration needed for a well-coordinated Covid-19 pandemic response strategy. If these issues are ignored, the previous gains made in anatomical ethical practices may be destroyed. Some useful recommendations for policymaking geared towards prevention or curtailing these emerging issues have been instilled in this paper.","Okafor, Izuchukwu Azuka; Chia, Terkuma",Anatomical sciences education,87,1

The aim of this study was to outline the main issues that led tobacco smoking being discussed as a potential risk factor associated with COVID-19. METHODS articles from MEDLINE and pre-prints published from January to April 2020 were identified. RESULTS data from China showed that men had more severe outcomes of COVID-19 than women. Since smoking prevalence is very high among Chinese men in comparison to women, it was hypothesized that smoking could be a risk factor for poor prognosis. This was also supported by the higher prevalence of comorbidities, many of which are tobacco-related diseases, in patients with severe COVID-19, who were also more likely to have a smoking history. A meta-analysis confirmed these results reporting an OR=2.25 (95% CI: 1.49-3.39) for developing severe Covid-19 among patients with a smoking history. Some authors, noticing that reported smoking prevalence among hospitalized patients was substantially below smoking prevalence in the corresponding populations, speculated a protective role of nicotine. However, it is likely that low prevalence among hospitalized patients are partially due to many smokers misclassified as nonsmokers. Tobacco smoking seems to cause a dose-dependent upregulation of the angiotensin-converting- enzyme-2 (ACE2), the virus cellular entry receptor, which could explain the higher risk of severe COVID-19 in smokers. CONCLUSIONS There is need for further independent studies to clarify the role of smoking on COVID-19 incidence, progression and mortality.","Cattaruzza, Maria Sofia; Zagà, Vincenzo; Gallus, Silvano; D'Argenio, Paolo; Gorini, Giuseppe",Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,87,5

Our aim is to demonstrate our URI experience related to CRVs after allo-HSCT. METHODS From January 2013 to November 2015, 39 post allo-HSCT patients with acute URI symptoms were included in the study. We evaluated CRVs by multiplex PCR from nasopharyngeal wash and throat swabs. RESULTS The median age of the patients was 39 (range 20-67 years). A total of 25 patients (64%) had viral panel positivity at a median 140 days post-transplant (range 3-617 days). The most common agents detected were respiratory syncytial virus (32%) and parainfluenza (32%). The patients with viral panel positivity had significantly lower lymphocyte count (1.05×109/l versus 3.09×109/l; P=0.013). During follow-up, 20 patients (80%) were diagnosed with pneumonia. Patients with concurrent bacterial or fungal infections were more likely to have pneumonia (100% versus 68%; P=0.023). 10 patients (40%) died due to pneumonia and related complications. Lower lymphocyte counts and higher C-reactive protein levels at the time of viral panel positivity were risk factors for mortality (1.5×109/l versus 0.39×109/l, P=0.007; 74.2 versus 199.7, P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS The viral panel was positive in 64% of patients with acute URI symptoms. Lower lymphocyte count was detected in CRV-positive patients. The onset of concomitant bacterial or fungal infections increased the risk of lower respiratory infection disease. Indeed, prospective studies should be designed for risks and outcomes of CRVs in allo-HSCT recipients.","Atilla, Erden; Sahin, Didem; Atilla, Pinar Ataca; Dolapci, Istar; Tekeli, Alper; Bozdag, Sinem Civriz; Yuksel, Meltem Kurt; Toprak, Selami Kocak; Ilhan, Osman; Arslan, Onder; Ozcan, Muhit; Gurman, Gunhan; Topcuoglu, Pervin",Antiviral therapy,87,0

These infections evoke incomplete immunity, as individuals can be repeatedly reinfected throughout life. We report that acute viral LRI causes rapid pulmonary CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (TCD8) functional impairment via programmed death-1/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) signaling, a pathway previously associated with prolonged antigenic stimulation during chronic infections and cancer. PD-1-mediated TCD8 impairment occurred acutely in mice following infection with human metapneumovirus or influenza virus. Viral antigen was sufficient for PD-1 upregulation, but induction of PD-L1 was required for impairment. During secondary viral infection or epitope-only challenge, memory TCD8 rapidly reexpressed PD-1 and exhibited severe functional impairment. Inhibition of PD-1 signaling using monoclonal antibody blockade prevented TCD8 impairment, reduced viral titers during primary infection, and enhanced protection of immunized mice against challenge infection. Additionally, PD-1 and PD-L1 were upregulated in the lungs of patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, or parainfluenza virus infection. These results indicate that PD-1 mediates TCD8 functional impairment during acute viral infection and may contribute to recurrent viral LRIs. Therefore, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway may represent a therapeutic target in the treatment of respiratory viruses.","Erickson, John J; Gilchuk, Pavlo; Hastings, Andrew K; Tollefson, Sharon J; Johnson, Monika; Downing, Melissa B; Boyd, Kelli L; Johnson, Joyce E; Kim, Annette S; Joyce, Sebastian; Williams, John V",The Journal of clinical investigation,87,1

Dose limitations to organs at risk (OARs) are invariably obstacles in increasing the prescription dose. Additionally, it is controversial that the excessive hyperdose sleeve, the volume receiving a dose equal to or greater than twice the reference dose, should be eliminated in gynecological HDR brachytherapy. On the other hand, the technique of simultaneous integrated protection was reported for large hepatocellular carcinoma treatment, and similarly, internal high-dose brachytherapy could be used for treating bulky cervical carcinoma. PATIENT CONCERNS A 54-year-old female had irregular genital bleeding and lost 13 kg in one year. DIAGNOSIS She was diagnosed with T3bN1M0 cervical cancer in another hospital. The transverse diameter of the primary tumor was 10.5 cm. INTERVENTIONS The whole pelvis and para-aortic lymph node were irradiated with a total of 50 Gy in 25 fractions, but the size of the tumor showed only a slight decrease to 8.9 cm. After external beam radiotherapy, first-time high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy (HDR-ISBT) was administered without ""intentional internal high-dose (IIHD) policy,"" the technique of high-dose administration to only the inside of the tumor. Considering the rectum dose limitation, in the additional 2 times of brachytherapy, ""IIHD policy"" HDR-ISBT was applied. In the second and third HDR-ISBT, the percentage of the volume exposed to 200% of the prescribed dose for high-risk clinical target volume increased by 241% and 204% compared with the first HDR-ISBT, while the doses to OARs were not significantly higher than those of the first-time HDR-ISBT. OUTCOMES Complete response was obtained, and no recurrence findings and side effects caused by HDR-ISBT have been detected for 2 years and 9 months. LESSONS To our knowledge, this is the first report of IIHD HDR-ISBT for bulky cervical cancer. This technique can be the solution for treating bulky cervical cancer.","Kashihara, Tairo; Kobayashi, Kazuma; Iijima, Kotaro; Murakami, Naoya; Yoshida, Ken; Okuma, Kae; Nakamura, Satoshi; Takahashi, Kana; Inaba, Koji; Igaki, Hiroshi; Nakayama, Yuko; Kato, Tomoyasu; Uno, Takashi; Itami, Jun",Medicine,87,17

MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixteen patients with DM2 were questioned about respiratory symptoms. They underwent PSG with morning arterial gas analyses (AGA). Respiratory functions and phrenic CMAPs were studied. The data were compared to those of 16 healthy controls and 25 patients with DM1. RESULTS Daytime tiredness is the most common symptom, but orthopnea was reported in 13% of patients with DM2. A detailed sleep architecture analysis revealed a significantly greater proportion of time in stage 3 and REM sleep, and a shorter time in stage 2 in the DM2 than in controls. Lower respiratory volumes and pressures, abnormalities in AGA, night oxygen desaturation and higher EtCO2 are present in DM2, but are less pronounced than in the DM1 population. Small CMAP amplitudes were presented in 12% of patients with DM2, correlating with smaller respiratory functions and poorer sleep quality. AHI was abnormal in 38% of DM2, mainly due to obstructive apneas. PSG did not reveal hypoventilation. CONCLUSIONS Diaphragm weakness and sleep apneas might be present in patients with DM2; therefore, we suggest regular questioning about symptoms of respiratory insufficiency and monitoring of phrenic CMAP. PSG should be recorded, when patients have suggestive symptoms, abnormalities in AGA or higher BMI.","Leonardis, L; Blagus, R; Dolenc Groselj, L",Acta neurologica Scandinavica,87,30

The characteristics of multicentric lesions has been poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for multicentric lesions, including specific HPV genotypes. METHODS A retrospective case-control study was performed involving patients histologically diagnosed with multicentric lesions between January 2018 and October 2019. Controls were patients histologically diagnosed with single cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and admitted during the same period. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to assess the risk factors for multicentric lesions. RESULTS Of 307 patients with multicentric lesions, the median age was 50 years (interquartile range: 43-55.5), and they were older than patients with single CIN (median age: 43 years, interquartile range: 36-50). In the multicentric lesion group, the proportions of cytologic abnormalities, HPV positivity, and multiple HPV infections were 68.9, 97.0, and 36.5%, respectively. In the multivariable analysis, menopause, a history of malignant tumors beyond the lower genital tract and multiple HPV infections were associated with the incidence of multicentric lesions (Odd ratio (OR) = 3.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.24-4.41; OR = 9.58, 95% CI 1.02-89.84; OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.03-2.10). The common HPV genotypes were HPV16, HPV53, HPV58, HPV52, HPV51, HPV56 and HPV18 in patients with multicentric lesions. The proportion of HPV16 infection was higher in high-grade lesions group than that in low-grade lesions group (OR = 2.54, 95% CI 1.34-4.83). The OR for multicentric lesions, adjusted for menopause, smoking, gravidity, parity, a history of malignant tumor beyond the lower genital tract and multiple HPV infection, was 1.97 (95% CI 1.04-3.75) in patients with HPV51 infection. CONCLUSIONS Multicentric lesions were associated with menopause, a history of malignant tumors and multiple HPV infections. HPV16 was the most common genotype, especially in high grade multicentric lesions and HPV51 infection was found to be a risk factor for detecting multicentric lesions.","Zhang, Jing; Liu, Guangcong; Cui, Xiaoli; Yu, Huihui; Wang, Danbo",BMC infectious diseases,87,16

STUDY DESIGN Prospective cohort study of 150 patients with C2-C4 clinical class of primary chronic venous disease (CVD). Management consisted of initial conservative measures, following which, the patients were given a choice of continuing conservative therapy, or surgical treatment. Patients completed Specific Quality of Life and Outcome Response--Venous (SQOR-V) tool before initial visit, after completion of conservative treatment, and at 1 and 12 month follow up visits after surgical treatment. Management consisted of initial conservative measures. QOL score and symptom score (SS) part of this instrument was analyzed separately. RESULTS Conservative treatment resulted in improvement of symptom score in 85(57%) patients, and the QOL in 111(74%) patients. Despite this improvement, the majority of patients (121) chose surgical option. At the 1-month follow up after surgical treatment 97 (80%) patients reported significant improvement of their symptoms and 114 (94%) in the QOL compare to their status after conservative therapy. The QOL improvement was due mainly to improvement in symptom score. Patients who improved after conservative therapy were more than 15 times more likely to have symptoms relief at 1 month (RR = 15.6, 95% CI 4.3-56.5), and 21 times higher at 1 year after surgery (RR = 21.3, 95% CI 4.7-96.9) compared with those who did not change the SS. CONCLUSIONS Surgical treatment resulted in a better relief of symptoms compare to conservative therapy. The relief of symptoms after conservative therapy predicts better outcomes of surgical treatment. These findings suggest that success of conservative therapy should be considered as an indication, and the failure of conservative therapy should not be an indication to surgical treatment.","Lurie, Fedor; Kistner, Robert L",Annals of surgery,87,20

The purpose of this study was to investigate the sterility of ethyl chloride topical anesthetic spray applied before an injection. Our a priori hypothesis was that application of the spray after the skin has been prepared would not alter the sterility of the injection site. METHODS We conducted a prospective, blinded, controlled study to assess the effect of ethyl chloride spray on skin sterility. Fifteen healthy adult subjects (age, twenty-three to sixty-one years) were prepared for mock injections into both shoulders and both knees, although no injection was actually performed. Three culture samples were obtained from each site on the skin: one before skin preparation with isopropyl alcohol, one after skin preparation and before application of ethyl chloride, and one after ethyl chloride had been sprayed on the site. In addition, the sterility of the ethyl chloride was tested directly by inoculating cultures with spray from the bottles. RESULTS Growth occurred in 70% of the samples obtained before skin preparation, 3% of the samples obtained after skin preparation but before application of ethyl chloride, and 5% of the samples obtained after the injection site had been sprayed with ethyl chloride. The percentage of positive cultures did not increase significantly after application of ethyl chloride (p = 0.65). Spraying of ethyl chloride directly on agar plates resulted in growth on 13% of these plates compared with 11% of the control plates; this difference was also not significant (p = 0.80). CONCLUSIONS Although ethyl chloride spray is not sterile, its application did not alter the sterility of the injection sites in the shoulder and knee.","Polishchuk, Daniil; Gehrmann, Robin; Tan, Virak",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Hence, it is highly important to regulate their activity and develop synthetic PLA2 inhibitors as new agents to treat inflammatory diseases. AREAS COVERED This review article summarizes the most important synthetic PLA2 inhibitors developed to target each one of the four major types of human PLA2 (cytosolic cPLA2, calcium-independent iPLA2, secreted sPLA2, and lipoprotein-associated Lp-PLA2), discussing their in vitro and in vivo activities as well as their recent applications and therapeutic properties. Very recent findings on the role of PLA2 in the pathobiology of COVID-19 are also discussed. EXPERT OPINION Although a number of PLA2 inhibitors have entered clinical trials, none of them has reached the market yet. Lipoprotein-associated PLA2 is now considered a biomarker of vascular inflammation rather than a therapeutic target for inhibitors like darapladib. Inhibitors of cytosolic PLA2 are likely to find topical applications for diseases like atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Inhibitors of secreted PLA2, varespladib and varespladib methyl, are currently under investigation for repositioning in snakebite envenoming. A deeper understanding of PLA2 enzymes is needed for the development of novel selective inhibitors. Lipidomic technologies in combination with classical medicinal chemistry approaches may be useful tools towards this goal.","Batsika, Charikleia S; Gerogiannopoulou, Anna-Dimitra D; Mantzourani, Christiana; Vasilakaki, Sofia; Kokotos, George",Expert opinion on drug discovery,87,33

Poor sleep is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. The effect of menopausal hormone therapy on sleep quality is unclear. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to summarize the efficacy of menopausal hormone therapy on self-reported sleep quality. Electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews CENTRAL, and PsycInfo) were searched from 2002 to October 2015. Randomized trials assessing the effect of menopausal hormone therapy with a minimum follow up of 8 weeks were included. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened independently and in duplicate. Primary outcome included sleep items within a questionnaire, scale or diary. Standardized mean differences across trials were pooled using random-effects models. The search identified 424 articles, from which 42 trials were included. Seven trials at a moderate to high risk of bias enrolling 15,468 women were pooled in meta-analysis. Menopausal hormone therapy improved sleep quality in women who had vasomotor symptoms at baseline [standardized mean difference -0.54 (-0.91 to -0.18), moderate quality evidence]. No difference was noted when women without such symptoms were analyzed separately or combined. Across 31 sleep quality questionnaires, daytime dysfunction was the most evaluated sleep domain. Menopausal hormone therapy improves sleep in women with concomitant vasomotor symptoms. Heterogeneity of trials regarding study population, formulations, and sleep scales; limit overall certainty in the evidence. Future menopausal hormone therapy trials should include assessment of self-reported sleep quality using standardized scales and adhere to reporting guidelines.","Cintron, Dahima; Lipford, Melissa; Larrea-Mantilla, Laura; Spencer-Bonilla, Gabriela; Lloyd, Robin; Gionfriddo, Michael R; Gunjal, Shalak; Farrell, Ann M; Miller, Virginia M; Murad, Mohammad Hassan",Endocrine,87,1

AREAS COVERED Advances in rapid phenotypic and molecular-based AST systems. EXPERT OPINION AST has changed over the past decade, with many rapid phenotypic and molecular methods developed to demonstrate phenotypic or genotypic resistance, or biochemical markers of resistance such as β-lactamases associated with carbapenem resistance. Most methods still require isolation of bacteria from specimens before both legacy and newer methods can be used. Bacterial identification by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy is now widely used and is often key to interpretation of rapid AST results. Several PCR arrays are available to detect the most frequent pathogens associated with bloodstream infections and their major antimicrobial resistance genes. Many advances in whole-genome sequencing of bacteria and fungi isolated by culture as well as directly from clinical specimens have been made but are not yet widely available. High cost and limited throughput are the major obstacles to uptake of rapid methods, but targeted use has allowed many laboratories to be able to use many of these systems. Continued development and decreasing costs are expected to result in more extensive use of these increasingly useful methods.","Jacobs, Michael R; Colson, Jordan D; Rhoads, Daniel D",Expert review of molecular diagnostics,87,1

METHODS We analysed weekly counts of influenza, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus available from a Queensland laboratory network for the year 2020. These were compared with averaged counts from 2015 to 2019. RESULTS Overall, 686,199 tests were performed. The timing of NPI implementation was associated with a sharp and sustained decline in influenza, where during the typical annual influenza season (weeks 23-40) no cases were detected from 163,296 tests compared with an average of 26.1% (11,844/45,396) of tests positive in 2015-2019. Similar results were observed for human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza. Respiratory syncytial virus detections also declined but increased in weeks 48-52 (5.6%; 562/10,078) to exceed the 2015-2019 average (2.9%; 150/5,018). Rhinovirus detections increased after schools reopened, peaking in weeks 23-27 (57.4%; 36,228/63,115), exceeding the 2017-2019 detections during that period (21.9%; 8,365/38,072). CONCLUSIONS NPIs implemented to control COVID-19 were associated with altered frequency and proportions of respiratory virus detections. Implications for public health: NPIs derived from influenza pandemic plans were associated with profound decreases in influenza detections during 2020.","El-Heneidy, Asmaa; Ware, Robert S; Robson, Jennifer M; Cherian, Sarah G; Lambert, Stephen B; Grimwood, Keith",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,87,1

However, with recent improvements in flexible endoscopic instrumentation and techniques, totally peroral endoscopic approaches could reduce the invasiveness of myotomic procedures. The aim of the study was to establish the feasibility and efficacy of endoscopic submucosal pyloromyotomy in a porcine model. METHODS Four pigs were included in a preliminary study and a 2-week survival study was performed in another four pigs. An esophagogastroduodenoscope was inserted perorally into the stomach. Saline solution was injected into the submucosal space proximal to the pylorus. The gastric mucosa was incised and a 5-cm submucosal tunnel was created. After exposure of the muscular layer in a submucosal tunnel, myotomy of the circular muscle layer was performed until the longitudinal muscular layer was reached. Once myotomy was completed, endoscopic clips were used to re-approximate the mucosal incision. RESULTS Submucosal dissection, identification of the circular muscular layer, and pyloromyotomy were achieved in all animals. Acute complications such as bleeding and perforation were not observed in any cases. Median pyloric resting pressure was reduced from 16.5 mmHg to 6.1 mmHg immediately after myotomy and 8.4 mmHg at 14 days after myotomy. CONCLUSION Peroral endoscopic submucosal pyloromyotomy appears to be technically feasible and effective. Potential clinical applications, such as for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis or delayed gastric emptying after esophagectomy, could be considered after confirmation of safety in additional survival studies.","Kawai, M; Peretta, S; Burckhardt, O; Dallemagne, B; Marescaux, J; Tanigawa, N",Endoscopy,87,17

METHODS Fifty-two patients with bilateral hernia were enrolled in this double-blind randomized controlled trial (NCT02023203). Each hernia, in the same patient, was randomized to implant LP-PTFE or SP-PPL mesh during totally extraperitoneal laparoscopic hernia repair. Patients were followed at 7 days, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 60 months after surgery. Visual analog scale (VAS) score was employed to evaluate the outcomes. Student's t test was used in case of normally distributed continuous variables, while the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used in case of not normally distributed variables. Chi square test was used for analysis of categorical variables. RESULTS Median VAS discomfort score with SP-PPL was significantly higher than LP-PTFE at 1 and 3 months after surgery (p = 0.003 in both cases). LP-PTFE showed significantly lower median score than SP-PPL at 7 days after surgery (p = 0.025) regarding pain at movement. Testicular pain was lower in case of LP-PTFE than SP-PPL at 7 days, 1 and 3 months after surgery (p = 0.005, p = 0.004 and p = 0.004, respectively). LP-PTFE was significantly more difficult to handle (p = 0.001). At 60 months, one recurrence was observed in the LP-PTFE group (p = 1.0000). CONCLUSIONS LP-PTFE has less postoperative discomfort and pain up to 3 months after surgery, without differences after that period, although it shows more difficulty in handling and recurrences occur even if not statistically significant.","Alarcón, I; Balla, A; Soler Frías, J R; Barranco, A; Bellido Luque, J; Morales-Conde, S",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,87,33

However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer has improved, and chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab may have a preoperative tumor-reducing effect, especially for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive cases. CASE SUMMARY We report a case of successful radical resection with PD after neoadjuvant S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) and trastuzumab in a patient (66-year-old male) with advanced gastric cancer invading the pancreatic head. Initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy detected a type 3 advanced lesion located on the lower part of the stomach obstructing the pyloric ring. Computed tomography detected lymph node metastasis and tumor invasion to the pancreatic head without distant metastasis. Pathological findings revealed adenocarcinoma and HER2 positivity (immunohistochemical score of 3 +). We performed staging laparoscopy and confirmed no liver metastasis, no dissemination, negative lavage cytological findings, and immobility of the distal side of the stomach due to invasion to the pancreas. Laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy was performed at that time. One course of SOX and three courses of SOX plus trastuzumab were administered. Preoperative computed tomography showed partial response; therefore, PD was performed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and pathological radical resection was achieved. CONCLUSION We suggest that radical resection with PD after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus trastuzumab is an option for locally advanced HER2-positive gastric cancer invading the pancreatic head in the absence of non-curative factors.","Yura, Masahiro; Takano, Kiminori; Adachi, Kiyohiko; Hara, Asuka; Hayashi, Keita; Tajima, Yuki; Kaneko, Yasushi; Ikoma, Yoichiro; Fujisaki, Hiroto; Hirata, Akira; Hongo, Kumiko; Yo, Kikuo; Yoneyama, Kimiyasu; Dehari, Reiko; Koyanagi, Kazuo; Nakagawa, Motohito",World journal of gastroenterology,87,29

Colostrum is accordingly expected to be attractive to newborns. The present study aims to assess whether colostrum is olfactorily attractive for 2-day-old newborns when presented against mature milk or a control. METHODS The head-orientation of waking newborns was videotaped in three experiments pairing the odors of: (a) colostrum (sampled on postpartum day 2, not from own mother) and mature milk (sampled on average on postpartum day 32, not from own mother) (n tested newborns = 15); (b) Colostrum and control (water; n = 9); and (c) Mature milk and control (n = 13). RESULTS When facing the odors of colostrum and mature milk, the infants turned their nose significantly longer toward former (32.8 vs 17.7% of a 120-s test). When exposed to colostrum against the control, they responded in favor of colostrum (32.9 vs 16.6%). Finally, when the odor of mature milk was presented against the control, their response appeared undifferentiated (26.7 vs 28.6%). CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that human newborns can olfactorily differentiate conspecific lacteal fluids sampled at different lactation stages. They prefer the odor of the mammary secretion - colostrum - collected at the lactation stage that best matches the postpartum age of their own mother. These results are discussed in the context of the earliest mother-infant chemo-communication. Coinciding maternal emission and offspring reception of chemosignals conveyed in colostrum may be part of the sensory precursors of attunement between mothers and infants.","Klaey-Tassone, Magali; Durand, Karine; Damon, Fabrice; Heyers, Katrin; Mezrai, Nawel; Patris, Bruno; Sagot, Paul; Soussignan, Robert; Schaal, Benoist",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,87,11

The purpose of this study was to clarify the significance of PNI as a prognostic factor for early-stage clear cell ovarian carcinoma. A total of 82 patients with stage I-II (FIGO 2014) ovarian clear cell carcinoma undergoing primary surgery at our hospital from January 2005 to December 2017 were enrolled. PNI was calculated using the formula: 10 × serum albumin (g/ dL) + 0.005 × peripheral blood lymphocyte count (/mm3). Preoperative PNI exhibited relatively high area under the curve value (0.709) for 5 year survival, and the optimal cutoff value was 46.5. The overall survival was significantly shorter in the PNI-low group than in the PNI-high group. Multivariate analysis showed that high PNI was a significant independent prognostic factor for favorable prognosis (hazard ratio = 0.102, p = 0.010). There was no significant difference in recurrence-free survival between the two groups (p = 0.220), but the postrecurrence survival was significantly longer in the PNI-high group than in the PNI-low group (p = 0.0383). The preoperative PNI was a useful predictor of prognosis, even in early-stage ovarian clear cell carcinoma.","Yoshikawa, Nobuhisa; Yoshida, Kosuke; Tamauchi, Satoshi; Ikeda, Yoshiki; Nishino, Kimihiro; Niimi, Kaoru; Suzuki, Shiro; Kikkawa, Fumitaka; Kajiyama, Hiroaki",Scientific reports,87,31

The purpose of this study was to compare visual assessment of aneurysm recurrences and aneurysm recurrence volumetry with an example dataset of HydroSoft coils (HSC) versus bare platinum coils (BPC). METHODS For this retrospective study, 3-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography datasets acquired 6 and 12 months after endovascular therapy using BPC only or mainly HSC were analyzed. Aneurysm recurrence volumes were visually rated by two observersas well as quantified by subtraction of the datasets after intensity-based rigid registration. RESULTS A total of 297 aneurysms were analyzed (BPC: 169, HSC: 128). Recurrences were detected by aneurysm recurrence volumetry in 9 of 128 (7.0 %) treated with HSC and in 24 of 169 (14.2 %) treated with BPC (odds ratio: 2.39, 95 % confidence interval: 1.05-5.48; P = 0.039). Aneurysm recurrence volumetry revealed an excellent correlation between observers (Cronbach's alpha = 0.93). In contrast, no significant difference in aneurysm recurrence was found for visual assessment (3.9 % in HSC cases and 4.7 % in BPC cases). Recurrences were observed in aneurysms smaller than the sample median in 10 of 33 (30.3 %) by aneurysm recurrence volumetry and in 1 of 13 (7.7 %) by visual assessment. CONCLUSIONS Aneurysm recurrences were detected more frequently by aneurysm recurrence volumetry when compared with visual assessment. By using aneurysm recurrence volumetry, differences between treatment groups were detected with higher sensitivity and inter-observer validity probably because of the higher detection rate of recurrences in small aneurysms.","Schönfeld, M H; Schlotfeldt, V; Forkert, N D; Goebell, E; Groth, M; Vettorazzi, E; Cho, Y D; Han, M H; Kang, H-S; Fiehler, J",Clinical neuroradiology,87,7

The condensed cap mesenchyme is hypothesized to generate a population of stem/progenitor cells that undergo mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) originating nephrons. Few immunohistochemical markers are available for detecting cap mesenchymal cells in the early phases of MET. METHODS The expression of MUC1 was evaluated in the kidneys, of 4 human foetuses and 2 newborns. RESULTS MUC1 immunoreactivity was detected in all the examined kidneys in the cap mesenchyme and in the renal vesicles. Immunostaining for MUC1 in cap mesenchymal cells changed from one nodule to the next: some mesenchymal nodules were negative, some showed MUC1 reactivity in scattered cells, whereas in others, positive cells revealed the presence of a roundish developing epithelial structure. CONCLUSIONS Our data clearly indicates, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, immunohistochemical evidence of MUC1 expression during human kidney development. We focused on MUC1 reactivity in the cap mesenchyme. On the basis of these preliminary data, we speculate that MUC1 may be involved in human nephrogenesis and may play a relevant role in MET from the cap mesenchyme to the renal vesicle, changing the fate of renal stem/progenitor cells.","Fanni, Daniela; Fanos, Vassilios; Monga, Guido; Gerosa, Clara; Nemolato, Sonia; Locci, Annalisa; Van Eyken, Peter; Iacovidou, Nicoletta; Faa, Gavino","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",87,32

The aim of the present study was to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in post-operative digestive dysfunction. METHODS We selected patients managed by colorectal resection for rectal endometriosis, who had developed post-operative severe constipation and whose follow up was superior to 24 months. To assess the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this complaint, we performed a step-by-step work up including: low digestive tract endoscopy, colonic transit time measurement and when appropriate anorectal manometry, electromyography and defecographic evaluation. RESULTS Five out of 25 (20%) patients, whose age ranged from 27 to 41 years, were investigated for severe post-operative terminal constipation. Four different mechanisms responsible for terminal constipation were identified: tight stenosis of the colorectal anastomosis, post-operative neurological sequelae, colonic intussusception through the colorectal anastomosis and transit constipation that developed post surgery. CONCLUSIONS Post-operative constipation is a frequent complaint in women managed by colorectal resection for rectal endometriosis. A multidisciplinary approach is mandatory as pathophysiologic mechanisms may vary and prove difficult to understand. The risk of post-operative bowel dysfunction following colorectal endometriosis must be taken into account whenever this technique is proposed in young women presenting with a benign disease such as deep endometriosis.","Armengol-Debeir, Laura; Savoye, Guillaume; Leroi, Anne-Marie; Gourcerol, Guillaume; Savoye-Collet, Céline; Tuech, Jean-Jacques; Vassilieff, Maud; Roman, Horace",Human reproduction,87,31

Nidovirus RNA synthesis is mediated by a cytoplasmic membrane-associated replication/transcription complex that includes up to 16 viral nonstructural proteins (nsps), which carry common enzymatic activities, like the viral RNA polymerase, but also unusual and poorly understood RNA-processing functions. Of these, a conserved endoribonuclease (NendoU) is a major genetic marker that is unique to nidoviruses. NendoU activity was previously verified in vitro for the coronavirus nsp15, but not for any of its distantly related orthologs from other nidovirus lineages, like the arterivirus nsp11. Here, we show that the bacterially expressed nsp11 proteins of two arteriviruses, equine arteritis virus and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus, possess pyrimidine-specific endoribonuclease activity. RNA cleavage was independent of divalent cations in vitro and was greatly reduced by replacement of residues previously implicated in catalysis. Comparative characterization of the NendoU activity in arteriviruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus revealed common and distinct features of their substrate requirements and reaction mechanism. Our data provide the first biochemical evidence of endoribonuclease activity associated with arterivirus nsp11 and support the conclusion that this remarkable RNA-processing enzyme, whose substrate in the infected cell remains to be identified, distinguishes nidoviruses from all other RNA viruses.","Nedialkova, Danny D; Ulferts, Rachel; van den Born, Erwin; Lauber, Chris; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Ziebuhr, John; Snijder, Eric J",Journal of virology,87,12

It is a relatively rare disease and causes difficulties in clinical diagnosis and differential diagnosis of venous malformation. We retrospectively assessed the medical history, and clinical features, imaging features, pathological features and follow up of 11 patients diagnosed pathologically with spindle cell hemangiomatosis after surgery. There are two types of clinical appearances in spindle cell hemangiomatosis in the distal extremities: bleb-like nodules and varix-like nodules. Bleb-like nodules are mostly superficially located in the palm or interphalangeal joints with obvious hemorrhage in lesions and mainly composed of cavernous spaces rather than spindle cells. Varix-like nodules are located in the back of the hands or arms with normal skin color and mainly composed of solid areas of accumulated spindle cells.

Longitudinal observational study including veterans receiving mental health treatment at a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facility from January 1, 2017 to June 16, 2020. Observed and expected patient care for on-going and new treatment of depression, posttraumatic stress, substance use disorder, severe mental illness diagnoses, overdose, and suicide attempts, and psychotropic prescriptions for antidepressant, antipsychotic, benzodiazepine, opioid, and mood stabilizing medications are depicted. Percent change between actual and expected counts in the early months of the COVID pandemic (March 18-May 5, 2020) are computed. Decreases in counts of patients receiving mental health treatment early in the pandemic ranged from 7% to 20% for on-going treatment, and 28% to 37% for new treatment. TMH rapidly expanded across VHA, becoming the primary means by which encounters were delivered. Counts of patients receiving on-going care for suicide attempts were stable, and for overdoses, decreased by 17%. Counts of patients initiating care for suicide attempts and overdoses decreased by 30% and 38%, respectively. Weekly prescriptions and medication on-hand for psychotropics ranged from a 2% decrease to a 4% increase. New patient prescribing decreased 21%-50%. VHA and other large healthcare systems will need to expand outreach and continue to develop TMH services to maintain care continuity and initiate care for existing and new patients during COVID-19 and future large-scale outbreaks, epidemics, and disasters.

This exploratory analysis aimed to determine how various measures of recurrence would influence the definition of treatment success. METHODS Using an EHR dataset from 01/2007-06/2019 linked with Medtronic cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) data, patients who underwent a first AF ablation procedure following CIED implantation were identified. Data were analyzed for recurrence of AF stratified by varying definitions of successful ablation. Performance of various simulated external AF monitoring strategies was assessed. RESULTS A total of 665 patients were analyzed including 248 with paroxysmal AF (mean age 66.2±9.3 years, 73.0% male) and 417 patients with persistent AF (mean age 67.3±9.0 years, 73.6% male). Among patients with paroxysmal AF, survival free from recurrence at 1 year ranged from 28.2% to 72.1% (>6 min and >23 hours thresholds, respectively) with an overall median percentage of time in AF reduction of 99.6%. Among patients with persistent AF, survival free from recurrence at 1 year ranged from 24.9% to 60.0% (>6 min and 7 consecutive days >23 hours thresholds, respectively) with an overall median percentage of time in AF reduction of 99.3%. A single 7-day monitoring strategy had a sensitivity of <50% for detecting AF > 6 min in patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF. CONCLUSION In this real-world dataset of AF patients with CIEDs undergoing catheter ablation, treatment success varied substantially with different definitions of minimally required AF duration and is significantly impacted by the method of recurrence detection.

Three sets of reference ranges were finally built applicable for the healthy young (19-44 years), middle-aged (45-64 years) and elder adults ([Symbol: see text]65). Comparisons in parameters among the three cohorts showed that a statistically significant increase in CD16CD56+ NK cell was observed between the middle-aged and elder cohorts, whereas for the majority of the parameters, a significant decline was observed between the young and the middle-aged cohorts. Further results showed that inverse correlations were observed between the age and CD19(+) B, CD3(+) T, CD3(+)CD4(+) T, CD4(+)CD45RA(+)CD62L(+) naïve T cell and CD4(+)CD28(+)/CD4(+), while the positive one was identified between the age and the NK cell.

We previously showed that HMPV binds heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and that HMPV binding requires only the viral fusion (F) protein. To characterize the features of this interaction critical for HMPV binding and the role of this interaction in infection in relevant models, we utilized sulfated polysaccharides, heparan sulfate mimetics, and occluding compounds. Iota-carrageenan demonstrated potent anti-HMPV activity by inhibiting binding to lung cells mediated by the F protein. Furthermore, analysis of a minilibrary of variably sulfated derivatives of Escherichia coli K5 polysaccharide mimicking the HS structure revealed that the highly O-sulfated K5 polysaccharides inhibited HMPV infection, identifying a potential feature of HS critical for HMPV binding. The peptide dendrimer SB105-A10, which binds HS, reduced binding and infection in an F-dependent manner, suggesting that occlusion of HS at the target cell surface is sufficient to prevent infection. HMPV infection was also inhibited by these compounds during apical infection of polarized airway tissues, suggesting that these interactions take place during HMPV infection in a physiologically relevant model. These results reveal key features of the interaction between HMPV and HS, supporting the hypothesis that apical HS in the airway serves as a binding factor during infection, and HS modulating compounds may serve as a platform for potential antiviral development. IMPORTANCE Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a paramyxovirus that causes respiratory disease worldwide. It has been previously shown that HMPV requires binding to heparan sulfate on the surfaces of target cells for attachment and infection. In this study, we characterize the key features of this binding interaction using heparan sulfate mimetics, identify an important sulfate modification, and demonstrate that these interactions occur at the apical surface of polarized airway tissues. These findings provide insights into the initial binding step of HMPV infection that has potential for antiviral development.","Klimyte, Edita M; Smith, Stacy E; Oreste, Pasqua; Lembo, David; Dutch, Rebecca Ellis",Journal of virology,87,30

There is no report on XA presenting as a functioning adrenal mass in the literature. We present a case of XA mimicking a functioning adrenocortical carcinoma. CASE REPORT A 52-year-old man presented with right flank pain, fever, vomiting, and loss of appetite for 2 weeks. He had signs of dehydration and elevated blood glucose level. Ultrasonography revealed a right adrenal mass. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed lobulated and necrotic mass replacing the right suprarenal gland and encasing the right renal vein, adjacent inferior vena cava, psoas, and diaphragm. There was loss of fat planes with liver and upper pole of the right kidney. Biochemical evaluation indicated increased serum and urine cortisol levels. As a sequel to hypercortisolism-induced hyperglycemia, he developed spontaneous chest wall abscess and bilateral sudden vision loss due to vitreous hemorrhages. Pus and blood culture grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Adrenal suppressant ketoconazole was administered for better glycemic control. With a diagnosis of locally advanced adrenocortical malignancy, right radical adreno-nephrectomy was performed, and cut section revealed a pus collection of around 100 mL. Histopathology examination showed xanthogranulomatous inflammation involving adrenal gland, Gerota's fascia, psoas, and lymph nodes. Postoperatively, the patient recovered satisfactorily with favorable glycemic control. CONCLUSION XA can mimic adrenal neoplasms both clinically and radiologically and is associated with staphylococcal infection. It warrants surgical excision and culture-based antibiotics and is mostly diagnosed on postoperative histopathology.","Jayanth, Kalkunte Sriram; Balamurugan, S; Sureshkumar, Sathasivam; Anandhi, Amaranathan; Sree Rekha, J; Abdulbasith, K M; Rajesh, B S; Tajudeen, Muhamed",Tumori,87,33

Historical evidence suggests that Lupus patients have a higher incidence of several viral infections. This is likely due to a combination of immune dysfunction, immunosuppressive therapy and excess co-morbidities. In this context there has been concern that Lupus patients may be at a higher risk of developing COVID-19 and suffering a severe disease course. As a result, many Lupus patients have been advised to 'shield' by isolating from social contact in the hope that this will reduce the likelihood of infection. Early clinical data does not appear to show that the incidence of COVID-19 is higher in Lupus patients. Reassuringly, the clinical course of COVID-19 in Lupus does not generally seem to be more severe than in the general population. There has been huge interest in repurposing existing drugs as potential treatments, including several used to treat Lupus. Of these, corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine are the most well researched so far. The current evidence suggests that the corticosteroid dexamethasone improves outcome for the sickest COVID-19 patients requiring respiratory support. Initial reports suggested that hydroxychloroquine could have a positive impact on the course of COVID-19, however larger prospective studies have not supported this. Janus kinase inhibitors, currently being investigated for efficacy in lupus, have been shown to have anti-viral effects in vitro and inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway may dampen down the host hyper-inflammatory response. Several trials are ongoing to assess the outcome of the use of JAK inhibitors in COVID-19 positive patients. For most patients continuing with their existing therapies to prevent a lupus flare or adverse events associated with sudden corticosteroid withdrawal is important whilst an Individualised risk assessment remains vital.","Mason, Alice; Rose, Emily; Edwards, Christopher J",Lupus,87,1

Seven of thirty-two patients (22%) who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy had positive nodes. Twenty (33%) patients had recurrence including 6 patients with negative sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and 5 patients with positive SLNs. Three of 10 patients (30%) treated with Mohs surgery had local recurrence. CONCLUSIONS The overall local and systemic recurrences are similar to those previously reported. There is a higher recurrence rate than expected in patients with a negative SLN and a high local recurrence rate after Mohs surgery. Our data suggest that SLN evaluation may be less accurate in ear melanomas and that Mohs surgery may be associated with a relatively high local recurrence rate.","Jones, Teresa S; Jones, Edward L; Gao, Dexiang; Pearlman, Nathan W; Robinson, William A; McCarter, Martin",American journal of surgery,87,27

The research and medical communities are increasingly considering ways of reducing stigma, and health professionals have a role to play in normalising abortion as part of routine sexual and reproductive healthcare (SRH). We sought to investigate how health professionals may normalise abortion and challenge prevailing negative sociocultural narratives. METHODS As part of the Sexuality and Abortion Stigma Study (SASS), qualitative secondary analysis was conducted on two datasets containing health professionals' accounts of providing abortion in Scotland and England. A subsample of 20 interviews were subjected to in-depth, thematic analysis. RESULTS Four key themes were identified in heath professionals' accounts: (1) encountering resistance to abortion from others working in SRH; (2) contending with prevailing negative sociocultural narratives of abortion; (3) enacting overt positivity towards abortion provision; and (4) presenting abortion as part of normal, routine healthcare. CONCLUSIONS It is clear that negative attitudes toward abortion persist both inside and outside of healthcare systems, and need to be challenged in order to destigmatise those accessing and providing services. Health professionals can play a key role in normalising abortion, through the ways in which they frame their work and present abortion to women they treat, and others more widely. Our analysis suggests a key way to achieve this is by presenting abortion as part of normal, routine SRH, but that appropriate support and structural change are essential for normalisation to become embedded.","Maxwell, Karen J; Hoggart, Lesley; Bloomer, Fiona; Rowlands, Sam; Purcell, Carrie",BMJ sexual & reproductive health,87,12

ACKR2 is a chemokine-scavenging receptor, which mediates its effects through collaboration with inflammatory chemokine receptors (iCCRs). Here we reveal reciprocal regulation of branching morphogenesis in the mammary gland, whereby stromal ACKR2 modulates levels of the shared ligand CCL7 to control the movement of a key population of CCR1-expressing macrophages to the ductal epithelium. In addition, estrogen, which is essential for ductal elongation during puberty, upregulates CCR1 expression on macrophages. The age at which girls develop breasts is decreasing, which raises the risk of diseases including breast cancer.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has created unprecedented barriers for breastfeeding mothers to obtain various types of support: emotional, instrumental, informational, and appraisal. However, no research has evaluated the influence the pandemic has had on breastfeeding supports. The purpose of this study was to explore perceptions of social support among breastfeeding mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional phenomenological approach was taken utilizing semistructured interviews (March-June 2020) with currently breastfeeding mothers (n = 29). Data were analyzed through a process of immersion and crystallization. Results: Mothers are still able to obtain each type of support, however, support has been negatively influenced by the pandemic. Mothers reported experiencing increased stress and isolation and had an immense desire to receive in-person support from peers, family, childcare providers, and lactation specialists. Furthermore, mothers of multiple children felt if they did not already have breastfeeding knowledge from previous experiences they would be unsuccessful in breastfeeding due to their current lack of support. Conversely, a majority of mothers felt the pandemic had positively influenced their breastfeeding journeys due to concerns of formula shortages and extended maternity leaves. Finally, mothers were concerned about safely expressing breast milk on their return to work. Conclusion: Mother's ability to obtain breastfeeding support has been negatively impacted by the pandemic due to the inability to engage with individuals in-person and the lack of access to childcare. First-time mothers may be at higher risk of early breastfeeding cessation due to lack of support. However, breastfeeding journeys have also been positively influenced by allowing mothers more time at home with their child.

METHODS Three baboons received CMS by IV infusion and by 2 types of aerosols generators and colistin by subcutaneous infusion. Gamma imaging was performed after nebulisation to determine colistin distribution in lungs. Blood samples were collected during 9 h and colistin and CMS plasma concentrations were measured by LC-MS/MS. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted and simulations were performed to predict lung concentrations after nebulization. RESULTS Higher aerosol distribution into lungs was observed by scintigraphy, when CMS was nebulized with Pari LC® star than with Eflow Rapid® nebulizer. This observation was confirmed by the fraction of CMS deposited into the lung (respectively 3.5% versus 1.3%).CMS and colistin simulated concentrations in epithelial lining fluid were higher after using the Pari LC star® than the Eflow rapid® system. CONCLUSIONS A limited fraction of CMS reaches lungs after nebulization, but higher colistin plasma concentrations were measured and higher intrapulmonary colistin concentrations were simulated with the Pari LC Star® than with the Eflow Rapid® system.","Marchand, Sandrine; Bouchene, Salim; de Monte, Michèle; Guilleminault, Laurent; Montharu, Jérôme; Cabrera, Maria; Grégoire, Nicolas; Gobin, Patrice; Diot, Patrice; Couet, William; Vecellio, Laurent",Pharmaceutical research,87,1

Treatment of water samples with an alkaline protein-rich solution prior to plaque assay and optimization of RNA extraction for RT-qPCR were implemented to minimize the interference. The improved procedures were used in order to investigate reduction of three viral pathogens and the MS2 model virus in the presence of three coagulants. A conventional aluminium coagulant was compared to alternative agents (zirconium and chitosan) in a coagulation-filtration system. The highest virus reduction, i.e., 99.9-99.99%, was provided by chitosan, while aluminium and zirconium reduced virus by 99.9% in colour-rich water and by 90% in water with less colour, implying an effect of coagulant type and raw water quality on virus reduction.

Despite multiple attempts to address this unmet need, there have been minimal advances in clinical management, outcomes, and accuracy of diagnostic testing options over the last 3 decades. One strong contributor to a lack of medical progress is a variable case definition of disease. The inability to agree on a precise definition greatly reduces the likelihood of aligning findings from epidemiologists, clinicians, and researchers, which, in turn, severely hinders progress toward improving outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS Pediatric consensus definitions for sepsis are not accurate in term infants and are not appropriate for preterm infants. In contrast to the defined multistage criteria for other devastating diseases encountered in the NICU (e.g., bronchopulmonary dysplasia), there is significant variability in the criteria used by investigators to substantiate the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. SUMMARY The lack of an accepted consensus definition for neonatal sepsis impedes our efforts toward improved diagnostic and prognostic options, and accurate outcomes information for this vulnerable population.","Wynn, James L",Current opinion in pediatrics,87,31

Material and methods: Between January 2013 and June 2014, 42 patients with primary HCC complicated with cirrhosis and hypersplenism who underwent simultaneous RFA combined with Lap-Sp were enrolled at the Department of General Surgery, Beijing Di Tan Hospital. The median number of tumors ablated using RFA was one (range 1-3), and the median sum of the maximum diameter of tumors was 2.5 cm (range 1.2-5.4 cm). The related indicators before and after surgery, complications, and long-term effects were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The median operative time for 42 patients undergoing simultaneous RFA combined with Lap-Sp was 4.5 h (range 2.5-8.5 h), and the median blood loss was 120 mL (range 5-2200 mL). The incidence of moderate-to-severe postoperative complications and the perioperative mortality after surgery were 31.0 and 0%, respectively. The disease-free survival rate for one, three, and five years was 73.8, 19.7, and 16.4%, respectively. The overall survival rate was 90.5, 73.3, and 60.4%, respectively. Conclusion: Simultaneous RFA combined with Lap-Sp was safe and effective for patients with HCC complicated with cirrhosis and hypersplenism.","Jia, Zhe; Zhang, Ke; Jiang, Li; Huang, Ronghai; He, Rong; Wang, Zhenjun",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,87,10

A number of surveys have explored public perceptions of their risks and benefits. In this paper we meta-analyse these surveys to assess the extent to which the following four hypotheses derived from previous studies of new technologies might be said to be valid for nanotechnologies: risk aversion will prevail over benefit appreciation; an increase in knowledge will not result in reduced aversion to risks; judgements will be malleable and subject to persuasion given risk-centric information; and contextual, psychometric and attitudinal predictors of perceived risk from prior studies can help anticipate future perceptions of nanotechnologies. We find that half the public has at least some familiarity with nanotechnology, and those who perceive greater benefits outnumber those who perceive greater risks by 3 to 1. However, a large minority of those surveyed (44%) is unsure, suggesting that risk judgements are highly malleable. Nanotechnology risk perceptions also appear to contradict some long-standing findings. In particular, unfamiliarity with nanotechnology is, contrary to expectations, not strongly associated with risk aversion and reduced 'knowledge deficits' are correlated with positive perceptions in this early and controversy-free period. Psychometric variables, trust and affect continue to drive risk perceptions in this new context, although the influence of both trust and affect is mediated, even reversed, by demographic and cultural variables. Given the potential malleability of perceptions, novel methods for understanding future public responses to nanotechnologies will need to be developed.","Satterfield, Terre; Kandlikar, Milind; Beaudrie, Christian E H; Conti, Joseph; Herr Harthorn, Barbara",Nature nanotechnology,87,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Two pediatric surgeons from each of the 10 countries most affected by COVID-19 were surveyed over a 10-day period. Data were obtained regarding service provision, infection control, specific surgical conditions, and the surgical workforce. RESULTS Twenty pediatric surgeons responded. All centers had postponed non-emergency surgery and clinics for nonurgent conditions with virtual consultations being undertaken in 90% of centers. A majority (65%) of centers had not yet knowingly operated on a positive patient. Minimal access surgery was performed in 75% centers but a further 75% had reduced or stopped upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The management of simple appendicitis was unchanged in 70% centers, patients with intussusception were being referred for radiological reduction in all centers and definitive pull-through surgery for Hirschsprung patients was performed by 95% where washouts were successful. Timing of surgery for reducible neonatal inguinal hernias had changed in 55% of centers and the management of urgent feeding gastrostomy referrals and of inflammatory bowel disease patients failing with biological therapy varied considerably. CONCLUSION Service provision has been severely affected by COVID-19 leading to an inevitable increase in untreated surgical pathology. Better understanding of extrapulmonary infectivity, the risk of asymptomatic carriage in children, and the reliability of testing for surgical scenarios may allow appropriate use of conventional surgery, including laparoscopy and endoscopy, and rational development of the novel care pathways needed during the pandemic.","Nasher, Omar; Sutcliffe, Jonathan Richard; Stewart, Richard James",European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ...

The experience of colorectal resection through single-incision laparoscopic surgery was assessed, including the patient outcomes. METHOD A meta-analysis was performed of studies comparing single-incision laparoscopic with multiport laparoscopy. Endpoints included conversion to laparotomy, operation time, postoperative morbidity, length of skin incision and length of hospital stay. The MEDLINE database was searched and only comparative studies were included in the meta-analysis. Data were retrieved from full-text manuscripts. Meta-analysis was performed according to the Mantel-Haenszel method for random effects. RESULTS From October 2008 to December 2011, 1026 colorectal resections including 921 colonic and 105 rectal procedures using single-incision laparoscopic surgery were reported in 64 studies. Meta-analysis of the 15 comparative studies, including a total of 1075 procedures (494 single-incision and 581 multiport laparoscopies), showed no difference in conversion to open laparotomy [odds ratio (OR) 0.58 (0.24, 1.38); P=0.22], morbidity [OR 0.84 (0.61, 1.15); P=0.27] or operation time [weighted mean difference (WMD) -0.27 (-6.50, 5.95); P=0.93], but a significantly shorter total skin incision [WMD -0.52 (-0.79, -0.25); P<0.001] and a significantly shorter postoperative length of stay [WMD -0.75 (-1.30, -0.20); P=0.008] after single-incision laparoscopic surgery compared with a multiport laparoscopic approach. CONCLUSION Although only 15 nonrandomized comparative studies of varying methodology have been reported, this systematic review and meta-analysis of more than 1000 colorectal procedures suggest that single-incision laparoscopic colorectal surgery is feasible and safe.","Maggiori, L; Gaujoux, S; Tribillon, E; Bretagnol, F; Panis, Y",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,87,1

After low anterior rectal resection, the authors have reported on a novel, less complex pouch configuration, a transverse coloplasty pouch. The aim of the present work was to apply this new design to the ileal pouch construction, to evaluate feasibility, and to measure functional results in comparison with the J-pouch and the straight ileoanal anastomosis using the pig as an animal model. METHODS Twenty-three pigs underwent restorative proctocolectomy followed by reconstruction with straight ileoanal anastomosis (IAA; n = 5), J-pouch (n = 7), and a transverse ileal pouch (TIP; n = 11). Pigs were followed for 6 days postoperatively. Peristaltic function was assessed by manometry proximal to the pouch, in the reservoir, and at the level of the ileoanal anastomosis. Functional outcome was monitored by semiquantitative assessment of the general condition of the animals, postoperative feeding habits, and stool frequency and consistency. A Fourier analysis was performed in order to compare peristalsis in the ileal reservoirs. The reservoir volume was measured in situ by triple contrast computed tomography scan with 3D reconstruction. RESULTS Seventeen animals survived for 1 week. There was no difference in the general condition or the feeding habits of the groups. A significant number of pigs with the TIP pouch (7/10) had semisolid or formed stools as opposed to liquid stools after J-pouch (6/6) and IAA (4/5; p = 0.01). TIP animals had a lower stool frequency (3.2 +/- 1.14 per day) on day 6 after the operation than pigs with J-pouch, 5.33 +/- 1,03, and IAA, 4.6 +/- 1.82 (p = 0.0036). The in situ volume of the pouches did not differ significantly. The Fourier analysis demonstrated a disruption of peristalsis by the J-pouch and the TIP reconstruction but not after IAA. CONCLUSION The function of ileoanal reservoirs after proctocolectomy may result from the disruption of properistaltic waves after pouch formation. The mechanism of peristalsis disruption is independent of the in situ volume of the pouch.","Schmitz-Winnenthal, F H; Kadmon, M; Schwab, E; Galindo, L V; Bläuer, K; Niethammer, A; Hinz, U; Thomas, F; Schmied, B M; Nobiling, R; Weitz, J; Büchler, M W; Z'graggen, K",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,87,31

In this systematic review, we examined how e-health applications are used to support person-centered health care at the time of COVID-19. Methodology: Literature was systematically searched without language restriction and publication status between January 1 and May 25, 2020, to describe e-health's support on the person-centered health care to control the COVID-19 pandemic. PubMed, ScienceDirect, and CINAHL, MedRxiv, and Web of Science were used. Two researchers independently assessed the eligibility of each retrieved record. All included studies were subsequently rescreened by the researchers. The systematic review was conducted in accordance with preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. Results: We identified 60 articles and selected 8 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies used e-health technologies to facilitate clinical decision support and team care. Patient's engagement and access to health care from their homes were enhanced using telehealth and mobile health. Electronic health records were used to avail reliable data to health care providers and health authorities to make evidence-based decisions. Conclusion: Although there are limited studies to evaluate the effectiveness of e-health technologies for person-centered health care, the reviewed studies indicated e-health's potentials to improve the quality of health care and personalized health systems during COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS We searched PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science for all clinical trials and observational studies that compared self-gripping mesh versus sutured mesh fixation in Lichtenstein hernia repair. Combined outcomes were pooled as odds ratios or mean differences in a fixed-effect model, using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software for Windows. RESULTS Twelve randomized, controlled trials and 5 cohort studies (n = 3,722 patients) were included in the final analysis. The two groups, using self-gripping mesh or sutured mesh fixation, did not differ significantly in terms of recurrence rate (odds ratio = 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.18-2.44; P = .54) or postoperative chronic groin pain (odds ratio = 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.54-1.05; P = .09). The operative time was less in the self-gripping mesh group (mean difference = -7.85, 95% confidence interval -9.94 to -5.76; P < .0001). For safety analysis, there were comparable risks between self-gripping mesh and sutured mesh fixation groups in terms of postoperative infection (odds ratio = 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.53-1.23; P = .32), postoperative hematoma (odds ratio = 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.7-1.36; P = .9), and urinary retention (odds ratio = 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.18-2.44; P = .54). CONCLUSION Data from our analysis did not favor either of the two fixation techniques over the other in terms of recurrence or postoperative chronic groin pain. Decreased operative time in the self-gripping mesh group cannot justify a recommendation for its routine use.

The method uses peak parking experiments conducted on particles that were previously stripped of their stationary phase by flushing the column with trifluoroacetic acid at a temperature of 60°C. Further using pure organic solvents as the mobile phase, any potential retention or surface diffusion effect is omitted. To avoid interference between the parked peaks and baseline disturbances typically occurring when switching on and off the flow, peak parking experiments were carried out in a set-up wherein two identical columns were used in parallel. This set-up allowed to maintain the flow through the detector at all times, by redirecting the flow from one column to the other during the peak parking experiments. Several tracer molecules (ionic and deuterated tracers) were compared and it was found that the use of deuterated molecules provides the best possible coverage of the accessible space of the mesopore volume. Interpreting the peak parking responses obtained with these tracers with a model based on the effective medium theory (EMT) subsequently provided an estimate of the value of the mesopore diffusion obstruction factor γmp. Taking the well-established pore hindrance factor F(λ) correction into account, the obtained experimental γmp-values are more in agreement with the tortuous and constricted diffusion paths one can expect in the void space within a structure resembling a monolithic skeleton with tetrahedral connectivity rather than in the void space formed by a packing of nanospheres. This is also more in line with the measured internal porosity values lying around εpz=0.5, whereas a packing of nanospheres would rather correspond to an εpz of 0.4. As such, the presented protocol provides a means to infer the internal mesopore structure of reversed-phase particles.","Song, Huiying; Desmet, Gert; Cabooter, Deirdre",Journal of chromatography.

It has had unprecedented effect on healthcare systems globally with severe impact on every specialist service within the hospital including urology. While it affects the respiratory system causing symptoms ranging from fever, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, nausea, myalgia and fatigue, it eventually causes pneumonia and respiratory distress needing oxygenation and ventilation. Laboratory diagnosis is required to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19. Radiological changes are seen on chest XR or CT scan of patients. The surge in patients affected by the disease has led to extreme pressures on healthcare systems by the overwhelming number of critically unwell patients. This scenario has presented challenges to maintain other emergency and essential services. Reallocation of staff, wards and equipment has resulted in cancellations of many surgical procedures, requiring urologists to select only the most essential or critical procedures. The outpatient face-to-face clinics are also cancelled or changed to telephone or video consultations. In some hospitals, urologists are required to work outside of their usual scope of practice helping their respiratory and intensive care unit (ICU) colleagues. The pandemic is disrupting training and education opportunities for junior medical staff. In this review we provide guidance on the diagnosis and management of COVID-19, the influence it has on urological practice and consider the long-term implications that may be of consequence for years to come.","Ho, Hui Ching; Hughes, Thomas; Bozlu, Murat; Kadıoğlu, Ateş; Somani, Bhaskar K",Turkish journal of urology,87,17

MATERIALS AND METHODS For this prospective, single-arm study, from June 2014 to August 2016, twenty-five patients with hypervascular HCC, 2-5 cm in diameter were treated by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)-guided FAA before conventional RFA. Technical success of FAA and subsequent perfusion change of the tumor were evaluated by CEUS. Technical efficacy and ablation sizes were evaluated by CT/MRI at 1 month. Therapeutic outcomes, including local tumor progression (LTP), overall survival (OS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS One or two target feeding arteries were visible on CEUS for 52.6% (61/116) of the hypervascular HCCs 2-5 cm in diameter. The technical success rate of the FAA was 100%; 13/25 (52.0%) target tumors were evaluated as complete perfusion response, while 12/25 (48.0%) were evaluated as partial perfusion response. The ablation volume was 41.9 ± 17.5 cm3 (14.9-78.2 cm3) and the ablative safety margin was 8.2 ± 1.9 mm (4-12 mm) at the 1-month evaluation. These parameters did not differ significantly between the complete and partial subgroups. The cumulative rates of LTP at 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-ups were 0.0%, 4.2% and 4.2%, respectively. The 3-year OS and RFS were 70.3% vs. 59.8%, respectively. There were no treatment-related deaths. Major complications occurred in one patient (4.0%). CONCLUSION As an add-on to conventional percutaneous RFA, tailored CEUS-guided FAA can reduce tumor perfusion and provide good local control of HCC.","Li, Xiaoju; Xu, Ming; Liu, Ming; Tan, Yang; Zhuang, Bowen; Lin, Manxia; Kuang, Ming; Xie, Xiaoyan","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",87,31

The aim of the present study was to examine MA's effect on cell viability (by the MTT assay), reactive oxygen species (ROS levels, by flow cytometry) and key antioxidant enzyme activities (by spectrophotometry) in murine skin melanoma (B16F10) cells compared to those on healthy cells (A10). MA induced cytotoxic effects in cancer cells (IC50 42 µM), whereas no effect was found in A10 cells treated with MA (up to 210 µM). In order to produce a stress situation in cells, 0.15 mM H2O2 was added. Under stressful conditions, MA protected both cell lines against oxidative damage, decreasing intracellular ROS, which were higher in B16F10 than in A10 cells. The treatment with H2O2 and without MA produced different responses in antioxidant enzyme activities depending on the cell line. In A10 cells, all the enzymes were up-regulated, but in B16F10 cells, only superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase increased their activities. MA restored the enzyme activities to levels similar to those in the control group in both cell lines, highlighting that in A10 cells, the highest MA doses induced values lower than control. Overall, these findings demonstrate the great antioxidant capacity of MA.","Mokhtari, Khalida; Pérez-Jiménez, Amalia; García-Salguero, Leticia; A Lupiáñez, José; Rufino-Palomares, Eva E",Molecules,87,5

One such manifestation is bowel ischemia. This study thus aims to provide a more holistic review of our current understanding of COVID-19 induced bowel ischemia. METHOD AND RESULTS A meticulous search was performed using different keywords in PubMed and Google Scholar. Fifty-two articles were included in our study after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria and performing the qualitative assessment of the studies. A total of 25,702 patients were included in our study after the completion of the qualitative assessment. DISCUSSION COVID-19 commonly presents in the GIT as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain. The mechanism of bowel ischemia is associated with the formation of emboli which is related to COVID-19's high affinity for angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 on enterocytes, affecting the superior mesenteric vessels. Clinically, patients presented with abdominal pain and vomiting. CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis showed acute intestinal ischemia (mesenteric). Management is usually initiated with gastric decompression, fluid resuscitation, and hemodynamic support. Surgical intervention is also sought. CONCLUSION Intestinal ischemia presenting in patients with COVID-19 has to be considered when symptoms of severe abdominal pain are present. More research and guidelines are required to be able to triage patients with COVID-19 to suspect intestinal ischemia and to help in diagnosis and management.","Patel, Suyog; Parikh, Charmy; Verma, Deepak; Sundararajan, Ramaswamy; Agrawal, Upasana; Bheemisetty, Niharika; Akku, Radhika; Sánchez-Velazco, Diana; Waleed, Madeeha Subhan",International journal of clinical practice,87,1

Plastic mulching (PM) is widely used in China aiming to the increase of crop productivity. However, the impact of PM on reactive nitrogen (Nr) emissions and nitrogen (N) footprint has not been explicitly described. In this study, we collected 4051 observations from 394 published papers for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), maize (Zea mays L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and used meta-analysis to investigate how PM affected crop yield, net economic return, Nr emissions, and N footprints including nitrogen footprint per unit of output energy (NFo) and nitrogen footprint per unit of net economic return (NFe) at regional scale and across a range of precipitation and N fertilization gradients in China. The meta-analysis showed that compared to non-PM practice, PM increased grain yield by 25, 27, and 20% in potato, maize, and wheat, respectively, and enhanced net economic return by 19, 29, and 22%, respectively, with corresponding reduction in NFo of 24, 36, and 18% and NFe of 19, 37, and 19%, respectively. Potato and maize had greater energy output and net economic return than wheat. Plastic mulching was more effective in improving net economic return (or energy output) and reducing N footprints (i.e., NFe and NFo) in the semiarid region (i.e., annual precipitation <600 mm) when N was applied at 100-200 kg N ha-1, especially in potato and maize. Our analysis suggests that the use of PM enhanced grain yield and net economic return while lowering the N footprint without increasing Nr emission. Therefore, PM has great potential to mitigate Nr loss in China when crop species, N fertilization rate, and local environmental factors (i.e., growing region and annual precipitation) are appropriately considered.","Wang, Linlin; Coulter, Jeffrey A; Li, Lingling; Luo, Zhuzhu; Chen, Yinglong; Deng, Xiping; Xie, Junhong",The Science of the total environment,87,31

Few nationwide data are available to compare risk factors, treatment and outcomes of COVID-19 patients after ICU admission. OBJECTIVE To evaluate baseline characteristics, treatments and 30-day outcomes of patients admitted to Swedish ICUs with COVID-19. DESIGN Registry-based cohort study with prospective data collection. SETTING Admissions to Swedish ICUs from 6 March to 6 May 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 disease. PARTICIPANTS Adult patients admitted to Swedish ICUs. EXPOSURES Baseline characteristics, intensive care treatments and organ failures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. A multivariable model was used to determine the independent association between potential predictor variables and death. RESULTS We identified 1563 patients with complete 30-day follow-up. The 30-day all-cause mortality was 26.7%. Median age was 61 [52 to 69], Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III) was 53 [46 to 59] and 62.5% had at least one comorbidity. Median PaO2/FiO2 on admission was 97.5 [75.0 to 140.6] mmHg, 74.7% suffered from moderate-to-severe acute respiratory failure. Age, male sex [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.5 (1.1 to 2.2)], SAPS III score [aOR 1.3 (1.2 to 1.4)], severe respiratory failure [aOR 3.0 (2.0 to 4.7)], specific COVID-19 pharmacotherapy [aOR 1.4 (1.0 to 1.9)] and continuous renal replacement therapy [aOR 2.1 (1.5 to 3.0)] were associated with increased mortality. Except for chronic lung disease, the presence of comorbidities was not independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS Thirty-day mortality rate in COVID-19 patients admitted to Swedish ICUs is generally lower than previously reported despite a severe degree of hypoxaemia on admission. Mortality was driven by age, baseline disease severity, the presence and degree of organ failure, rather than pre-existing comorbidities.

In this article, we present an approach to the challenging problem of chronic leg ulcers that is based on the principles of evidence-based medicine, i.e., the explicit use of the best available scientific evidence as a guide to treatment. METHODS Selective review of the relevant literature, including current guidelines and meta-analyses, concerning diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for chronic leg ulcers. RESULTS The main types of causally directed treatment are: vein surgery to eliminate pathological reflux, interventions to improve the circulation in arterial occlusive disease, and treatment of underlying diseases, such as diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION Physicians providing modern evidence-based management of chronic leg ulcers should make use of their own clinical experience in combination with the best current scientific evidence.

Although there is no conclusive evidence about the efficacy of the drug for this purpose, surprisingly there are no conclusive studies in the literature concerning its mechanism of action inside cells, which is related to its interaction with nucleic acids. Here, we performed a robust characterization of the interaction between hydroxychloroquine and double-stranded DNA using single-molecule force spectroscopy and gel electrophoresis. Two different binding modes were identified, namely, minor groove binding for low drug concentrations and intercalation for high drug concentrations, and the sets of binding parameters were determined for each of these modes. Such results have unraveled in detail the molecular mechanism of action of the drug as a DNA ligand.","Bazoni, R F; Moura, T A; Rocha, M S",The journal of physical chemistry letters,87,1

Combined with their antigen presentation capacity, this powerful functionality enables pDCs to orchestrate innate and adaptive immune responses. pDCs combine features of both lymphocytes and classical dendritic cells and display unique molecular adaptations to nucleic acid sensing and IFN production. In the decade since the identification of the pDC as a distinct immune cell type, our understanding of its molecular underpinnings and role in immunity has progressed rapidly. Here we review select aspects of pDC biology including cell fate establishment and plasticity, specific molecular mechanisms of pDC function, and the role of pDCs in T cell responses, antiviral immunity, and autoimmune diseases. Important unresolved questions remain in these areas, promising exciting times in pDC research for years to come.","Reizis, Boris; Bunin, Anna; Ghosh, Hiyaa S; Lewis, Kanako L; Sisirak, Vanja",Annual review of immunology,87,1

To combat the devastating spread of SARS-CoV-2, extraordinary efforts from numerous laboratories have focused on the development of effective and safe vaccines. Traditional live-attenuated or inactivated viral vaccines are not recommended for immunocompromised patients as the attenuated virus can still cause disease via phenotypic or genotypic reversion. Subunit vaccines require repeated dosing and adjuvant use to be effective, and DNA vaccines exhibit lower immune responses. mRNA vaccines can be highly unstable under physiological conditions. On the other hand, naturally antigenic viral vectors with well-characterized structure and safety profile serve as among the most effective gene carriers to provoke immune response via heterologous gene transfer. Viral vector-based vaccines induce both an effective cellular immune response and a humoral immune response owing to their natural adjuvant properties via transduction of immune cells. Consequently, viral vectored vaccines carrying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have recently been generated and successfully used to activate cytotoxic T cells and develop a neutralizing antibody response. Recent progress in SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, with an emphasis on gene therapy viral vector-based vaccine development, is discussed in this review.","Bisgin, Atil; Sanlioglu, Ahter D; Eksi, Yunus E; Griffith, Thomas S; Sanlioglu, Salih",Human gene therapy,87,1

METHODS This pilot, open-label, single-arm study included adult symptomatic patients with suspected or confirmed CoViD-19 for whom the general practitioner or other carer had decided not to proceed to hospitalization. Participants were monitored daily at home, by measuring the pulse oximetry (SpO2) at rest and after a rapid walking test. The study assessed feasibility outcomes (at least 80% of patients recommended to be sent to the competent emergency room actually transferred within 24 hours from reporting) and efficacy (SpO2 at emergency room admission). Patients with SpO2 values below 90% (86% if affected by chronic pulmonary diseases) at rest or with a decrease in SpO2 of five percentage points after a rapid walking test were recommended for hospital care. RESULTS Thirty-seven participants reported by the local health unit of Alessandria and the Metropolitan City of Turin were included in the study. Enrollment, initially planned for two months to reach a target of 340, was interrupted early due to the drastic reduction in the number of cases. On average, each participant was monitored for 8.2 (median 6.0) days, for a total of 302 visits. The participants showed milder symptoms than those observed in the first phase of the epidemic, at least in terms of pulmonary impairment. No patient had a decrease in SpO2 of 5 percentage points or greater and only one patient required hospitalization due to a worsening of the disease. DISCUSSION The cases collected were not sufficient to demonstrate or refute the hypothesis of the monitoring test effectiveness. However, the study showed the feasibility of such a program, and raised some elements of interest regarding hospital territory integration, the need to develop tools to support home care and the variability of the clinical manifestations of the CoViD-19 disease.","Banzi, Rita; Sala, Luca; Colmi, Antonella; Gerardi, Chiara; Nattino, Giovanni; Occhipinti, Federica; Stura, Roberto; Targetti, Elena; Bertolini, Guido",Recenti progressi in medicina,87,17

METHODS Seven anesthetized adult swine underwent endoscopic placement of magnets into the small bowel and stomach. Using external magnets, the endoscopically placed internal magnets were brought into opposition under endoscopic view. After 1-2 weeks, the pigs were killed and analyzed. At laparotomy and under sterile conditions, peritoneal cultures were obtained. The anastomoses were evaluated endoscopically and tested using an air insufflation test. Finally, the anastomoses were resected and evaluated microscopically. RESULTS The average operative time for endoscopic placement of the magnets was 34.3 +/- 14.8 min. Successful placement and creation of anastomoses occurred in six of the pigs. One pig did not form an anastomosis because the magnets were too large to pass through the pylorus at the time of attempted magnet placement. Six swine experienced uncomplicated postoperative courses. One pig's postoperative course involved constipation for several days, requiring additional fluids and fiber supplementation. The findings at endoscopy showed that the magnets were adhered to the anastomosis, which were easily freed, or within the stomach. The air insufflation test results were negative for all the pigs. At laparotomy, there was no evidence of infection, abscess, or leak, but two peritoneal culture results were positive with scant growth of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, presumably contaminants. Microscopically, the anastomoses illustrated granulation and fibrous connective tissue without evidence of infection or leak. CONCLUSION Endoscopically placed magnets with external magnet guidance is a feasible and novel approach to creating patent gastroenteral anastomoses without abdominal incisions or sutures.","Myers, Christopher; Yellen, Benjamin; Evans, John; DeMaria, Eric; Pryor, Aurora",Surgical endoscopy,87,1

Therefore, there is an increasing need to understand the disease mechanisms, identify drug targets and inflammatory processes associated with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. To address this need, we created a targeted mass spectrometry based multiplexed panel of 96 immune response associated proteins. We applied the multiplex assay to a cohort of serum samples from asymptomatic and moderately affected patients. All patients had tested positive for a SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR and were determined to be subsequently positive for antibodies. Even 40-60 days post-viral infection, we observed a significant remaining inflammatory response in all patients. Proteins that were still affected were associated with the anti-inflammatory response and mitochondrial stress. This indicates that biochemical and inflammatory pathways within the body can remain perturbed long after SARS-CoV-2 infections have subsided even in asymptomatic and moderately affected patients.","Doykov, Ivan; Hällqvist, Jenny; Gilmour, Kimberly C; Grandjean, Louis; Mills, Kevin; Heywood, Wendy E",F1000Research,87,30

MATERIAL AND METHODS To determine the degree of intoxication, we studied the concentrations of low and medium molecular weight substances (SLMMW) in the oral fluid of patients. We studied the saliva of 20 patients (13 men and 7 women, average age 39 years). The control was done against the oral fluid of 10 healthy individuals. The studies were conducted in a control group consisting of 10 healthy individuals with intact oral mucosa and two groups of patients (20 patients in total) with drug poisoning. The first of these two groups of patients included 8 individuals without pathological changes in the oral mucosa, while the second group consisted of 12 patients diagnosed with catarrhal stomatitis that developed after acute drug poisoning. RESULTS It became known that endogenous intoxication develops in the oral fluid of patients with acute drug poisoning, which is manifested by a statistically significant increase in the content of SLMMW in comparison with practically healthy individuals (15.3%). And the total level of SLMMW in the oral fluid of patients with acute drug stomatitis and catarrhal stomatitis has increased by 42.3% relative to the data of practically healthy individuals. CONCLUSION Studies have shown the need for monitoring the oral cavity in patients with acute drug poisoning, with the aim of timely detection of pathologies of the oral mucosa in them and the appointment of complex treatment.","Shiraliyev, A V; Alasgarova, F A; Gasimova, A R; Aliyev, M M",Stomatologiia,87,5

Transcutaneous monitoring of renal tissue oxygen saturation is therefore of increasing interest. The aim of the present study was to compare renal tissue oxygen saturation measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during acute hypoxia in neonates directly on the kidney and transcutaneously. We hypothesized that transcutaneous renal tissue oxygen saturation measurements would be influenced by superficial tissue. Five term newborn piglets were anesthetized, instrumented and exposed to normocapnic hypoxia at an inspired oxygen concentration of 0.14. Regional tissue oxygen saturation (rSO₂) was simultaneously measured for comparison with the sensor of NIRS (Invos 5100, Somanetics Corp., Troy, MI, USA) applied directly on the left kidney (renaldirect rSO₂) and on the skin of right flank above the right kidney (renalskin rSO₂). Cerebral regional tissue oxygenation (cerebralskin rSO₂), arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were also monitored. NIRS parameters were analyzed in 5 s intervals during first 2 min of hypoxia. Hypoxia was achieved with an arterial oxygen desaturation from median (range) 95.3% (86.8-98.0) to 23.5% (13.0-41.0) after 2 min. HR and MAP did not change significantly during hypoxia. There were pronounced and lower renaldirect rSO₂ readings when compared with those of renalskin rSO₂ with significant differences from 25 to 55 s after initiation of hypoxia. Changes of cerebralskin rSO₂ and renalskin rSO₂ were similar. Transcutaneous monitoring of renal tissue oxygen saturation may underestimate acute oxygen desaturation of the kidney during hypoxia in neonates.","Pichler, Gerhard; Cheung, Po-Yin; Tze-Fun, Lee; Li, Elliott S; Schmölzer, Georg M",Nephrology,87,7

METHODS Baseline cross-sectional survey data was analysed from a prospective cohort study conducted between 2014 and 2016 among youth (aged 16-24 years) in Soweto and Durban. Interviewer-administered questionnaires collecting socio-demographic, sexual and reproductive health and mental health data were conducted. Household food insecurity was measured using the 3-item Household Hunger scale, with food insecure participants defined as having 'moderate' or 'severe hunger' compared to 'no hunger'. Depression was assessed using the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D 10) Scale (range 0-30, probable depression ≥10). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between depression and food insecurity. RESULTS There were 422 participants. Median age was 19 years (Interquartile Range [IQR] 18-21) and 60% were women. Overall, 18% were food insecure and 42% had probable depression. After adjustment for socio-demographic variables (age, gender, female-headed household, household size, and school enrollment), participants with probable depression had higher odds of being food-insecure than non-depressed participants (2.79, 95%CI 1.57-4.94). CONCLUSION Nearly one-fifth of youth in this study were food-insecure. Those with probable depression had increased odds of food insecurity. Interventions are needed to address food insecurity among urban youth in South Africa, combining nutritional support and better access to quality food with mental health support.","Jesson, Julie; Dietrich, Janan; Beksinska, Mags; Closson, Kalysha; Nduna, Mzikazi; Smit, Jenni; Brockman, Mark; Ndung'u, Thumbi; Gray, Glenda; Kaida, Angela",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,87,29

Methods Between July 2017 and July 2019, 18 patients with partial ACL injury were admitted. There were 10 males and 8 females, with an average age of 40.5 years (range, 22-57 years). There were 5 cases on the left knee and 13 cases on the right knee. Forteen cases had a clear history of trauma or sports injury, and 4 cases had no obvious cause. The time from injury to operation was 1-6 months (median, 3 months). Partial ligament was sutured using WALANT technique under arthroscopy. The operation time, total hospital stay, and postoperative hospital stay were recorded. Lachman test and anterior drawer test were performed to evaluate the knee joint stability after treatment, and Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores were used to evaluate the knee function. Five-point Likert scaling were used to evaluate postoperative patient satisfaction. Results The operation time was 30-100 minutes (mean, 64.2 minutes). The total hospital stay was 2-12 days (mean, 4.5 days). Postoperative hospital stay was 1-4 days (mean, 1.8 days). All incisions healed by first intention after operation, and no surgery-related complications occurred. All patients were followed up 12-36 months (mean, 19.1 months). Lachman test and anterior drawer test were negative after operation. Lysholm score and IKDC score at 6 and 12 months after operation were significantly higher than those before operation, and at 12 months after operation were higher than those at 6 months after operation, the differences were significant ( P<0.05). At last follow-up, according to five-point Likert scaling of patient satisfaction, 7 cases were very satisfied, 10 cases were relatively satisfied, and 1 case was general. The total patient satisfaction rate was 94.4% (17/18). MRI scan showed the good ligament tension.

Air travel in the United States declined in 2020 with significantly lower domestic and international flights. The dynamic change and uncertainty in the trend of COVID-19 have made it difficult to predict future air travel. This paper aims at developing and testing neural network models that predict domestic and international air travel in the medium and long term based on residents' daily trips by distance, economic condition, COVID-19 severity, and travel restrictions. Data in the United States from various sources were used to train and validate the neural network models, and Monte Carlo simulations were constructed to predict air travel under uncertainty of the pandemic and economic growth. The results show that weekly economic index (WEI) is the most important predictor for air travel. Additionally, daily trips by distance play a more important role in the prediction of domestic air travel than the international one, while travel restrictions seem to have an impact on both. Sensitivity analysis results for four different scenarios indicate that air travel in the future is more sensitive to the change in WEI than the changes in COVID-19 variables. Additionally, even in the best-case scenario, when the pandemic is over and the economy is back to normal, it still takes several years for air travel to return to normal, as before the pandemic. The findings have significant contributions to the literature in COVID-19's impact on air transportation and air travel prediction.","Truong, Dothang",Journal of Air Transport Management,87,16

Our results showed that NP inoculations were safe for the animals, which presented no clinical symptoms of worrying side effects, nor laboratorial alterations in the main biochemical and histological parameters, suggesting the absence of toxicity induced by NP. Moreover, NP injections successfully triggered the production of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by both Wistar and Lewis rats, showing the sensitization to have been well sufficient for the immunization of these strains of rats. Additionally, we observed the local lung activation of the Bronchus-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (BALT) of rats in the NP groups, suggesting that NP elicits specific lung immune response. Although pre-clinical and clinical studies are still required, our data support the recombinant NP produced by this research group as a potential immunizing agent for massive vaccination, and may represent advantages upon other recombinant proteins, since it seems to induce specific pulmonary protection.","Silva, Everidiene K.

The thematic analysis approach, comparative research method and descriptive statistical analysis are used to investigate the effects of this pandemic. In general, the empirical analysis results show having a high sensitivity to diseases, global tourism is considered as one of the hardest economic sectors hit by the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. First, these huge losses in revenue are still ongoing because the pandemic is fastly spreading worldwide. The hurts of global tourism are serious and can put the whole travel and tourism industry in long-term disruptions. Second, although global tourism has proven strong resilience in response to other previous crises, the results suggest that the negative impacts of this pandemic will longer-lasting expand on would tourism industry compared to others. Third, the analysis result highlights that the countries need robust and urgent solutions for global tourism to reduce the huge losses received from this pandemic. However, this pandemic can have potential long-term changes in customer behaviors and the supply chain in global tourism to help efficiently combat risks from epidemics in the future.

Despite this, it has one of the lowest vaccination rates globally and contributes to the largest pool of under-vaccinated children in the world. Why is the vaccination rate low in India? This paper explores the importance of historical events in shaping current vaccination practices in India. We examine India's aggressive family planning program implemented during the emergency rule in the 1970s, under which millions of individuals were sterilized forcefully. We find that greater exposure to the forced sterilization policy has negative effects on the current vaccination rate. We also find that institutional delivery and antenatal care are currently low in states where policy exposure was high. Together, the evidence suggests that the forced sterilization policy had a persistent effect on current health-seeking behavior in India.","Sur, P. K.",,87,16

As recent observations have shown, the most severe courses of acute respiratory infection, often leading to death, are due to uncontrolled cytokine production (hypercytokinemia). The research presented is devoted to assessment of mRNA expression of specific cytokines (IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, TNF-, IFN-{lambda}) and MxA in whole blood leukocytes, by means of real-time PCR. This study involved 364 patients with respiratory illness being treated in clinics in St. Petersburg (Russia) in 2018-2019 and 30 healthy subjects. In 70% of patients, bacterial or viral pathogens were identified, with influenza viral infections (types A, B) prevailing. Cytokine analysis was carried out in the acute phase of illness (2-3 days from onset of initial symptoms) and in the stage of recovery (days 9-10). Significant increases in the expression of IL-18, TNF, and IL-10 were observed, relative to controls, only with influenza viral infections. We have shown a difference in IL-6 mRNA expression in patients with bacterial or viral pathogens. No significant difference was found in WBC IL-4 expression levels between patients and healthy subjects. Investigation of the nuances of systemic cytokine production, in response to specific viral and bacterial pathogens, makes it possible to: assess the risks of developing hypercytokinemia during respiratory infection with agents circulating in the human population; and to predict the pathogenicity and virulence of circulating threats.","Plotnikova, M.

Thus, nursing policymakers, practitioners, and educators should understand the way nursing legislation is created and implemented, as well as its impact on the nursing profession. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to describe the structure of nursing legislation in Iran from the perspective of nursing policymakers. Methods: For this qualitative study, a content analysis approach was used. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews conducted with nursing policymakers (N = 15). Additionally, the content of Iranian government websites was used as collected data in the process of data analysis. Result: Three main categories emerged from the data: (a) the role of competent authorities, (b) the advancement of the nursing profession, and (c) the emergence of new diseases as an opportunity for developing nursing policy. Conclusion: Although the involvement of competent authorities plays a crucial role in structuring Iranian nursing policy, the role of nursing in treating emerging diseases also brings opportunities for nursing policymakers to revise current legislation and develop new practice acts. © 2021 National Council of State Boards of Nursing","Hatefimoadab, N.; Benton, D.

We aimed to study the clinico-etiological profile, outcomes and prognostic factors of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in non-ICU (ward) setting, and compare these parameters with that of patients in the ICU, wherever it was reported. A systematic review and meta-analysis was done on articles published till June 2020. Two authors independently extracted the data. The study population included patients who received mechanical ventilation in ward setting. Fourteen studies reporting on 20833 patients were included (20252 exclusively ventilated in ward), with most of the studies being from Israel, USA, Japan and Taiwan. Risk of bias was estimated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies, and was found to be low. Most common reason for intubation was respiratory illness. Most common variables predicting mortality were prognostic scores like APACHE-II and Acute Physiology Score (APS). Pooled mortality rate in ward across 6 studies was 0.72 (95% CI 0.69-0.74) with no heterogeneity among these 6 studies (I2=0.0). Mortality rate varied significantly with study population characteristics, and was lower among patients being weaned in ward. A major limitation of our study was the paucity of studies and significant heterogeneity among existing studies, with respect to outcomes like duration of ventilation, hospital stay, rates of complications, and prognostic factors. This systematic review and meta-analysis found that mortality among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in ward settings remains high. Data regarding other outcomes and prognostic factors predicting mortality was very heterogeneous highlighting the need for future studies concentrating specifically on these aspects.

Many studies simply assume samples mixed in a group are independent. However, this assumption may not be reasonable for a contagious disease like COVID-19. Specifically, people within a family tend to infect each other and thus are likely to be positively correlated. By exploiting positive correlation, we make the following two main contributions. One is to provide a rigorous proof that further cost reduction can be achieved by using the Dorfman two-stage method when samples within a group are positively correlated. The other is to propose a hierarchical agglomerative algorithm for pooled testing with a social graph, where an edge in the social graph connects frequent social contacts between two persons. Such an algorithm leads to notable cost reduction (roughly 20%-35%) compared to random pooling when the Dorfman two-stage algorithm is applied.","Lin, Yi-Jheng; Yu, Che-Hao; Liu, Tzu-Hsuan; Chang, Cheng-Shang; Chen, Wen-Tsuen",,87,24

FirstMIND (NCT04134936) is a Phase Ib, open-label, randomized study of tafa + R-CHOP or tafa + LEN + R-CHOP in newly diagnosed DLBCL. Methods: Eligible pts were ≥18 years, treatmentnaïve, with histologically confirmed DLBCL not otherwise specified, international prognostic index (IPI) 2-5 and ECOG performance status (PS) 0-2. Pts with known double-or triple-hit and transformed lymphoma were excluded. Treatment (Tx) comprised six 21-day cycles of tafa (12 mg/kg IV, Day [D] 1, 8, 15) + R-CHOP (arm A) or tafa (12 mg/kg IV, D1, 8, 15) + LEN (25 mg orally, D1-10) + R-CHOP (arm B). G-CSF and VTE prophylaxis was mandatory. Primary objective is safety;secondary objectives are ORR, PET-CR rate at end of Tx, PFS, long-term safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity. Results: From Dec 2019 to Aug 2020, 83 pts were screened in Europe and the US;66 were randomized (33 per arm). Data cut-off for this analysis: 9 Dec 2020;study is ongoing. Median age was 64.5 years (range 20-86). Overall, 30% (20/66) of pts were ≥70 years and many had high-risk disease: IPI 2 29%, IPI 3 46%, IPI 4 26%. ECOG PS: 47% of pts were ECOG PS 0, 44% PS 1, 9% PS 2. Most pts had stage III/IV disease (92%);46% had bulky disease. All pts experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). Grade ≥3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 54.5% and 12.1% (arm A) and 66.7% and 30.3% (arm B) of pts, respectively (Table). Serious TEAEs occurred in 42.4% (arm A) and 51.5% (arm B) of pts. There were three deaths, unrelated to tafa and/or LEN (sepsis, urosepsis, and COVID-19 pneumonia). R-CHOP dose intensity was maintained in both arms. Among 60 pts who completed tumor assessments after cycle 3, ORR was 89.7% (arm A) and 93.5% (arm B). Conclusions: These data suggest R-CHOP + tafa or tafa + LEN is tolerable in pts with Tx-naïve DLBCL and that R-CHOP dosing is not affected. Toxicities are similar to those expected with R-CHOP or R-CHOP + LEN.

Methods Maternal and cord blood sera were collected following term delivery after antenatal SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination, with the first vaccine dose administered during 27-36 weeks gestation. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) and receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific, IgG levels and neutralizing potency were evaluated in maternal and cord blood samples. Results The study cohort consisted of 171 parturients (median age, 31 years; median gestational age, 39.7 weeks): 83 (48.5%) immunized at early 3rd trimester (1st dose at 27-31 weeks), and 88 (51.5%) immunized at late 3rd trimester (1st dose at 32-36 weeks). All mother-infant paired sera were positive for anti S- and anti-RBD-specific IgG. Anti-RBD-specific IgG concentrations in neonatal sera were higher following early versus late 3rd trimester vaccination and were positively correlated with increasing time since vaccination (r= 0.26; P=0.001). The median placental transfer ratios of anti-S and anti-RBD specific IgG were increased following early versus late 3rd trimester immunization (anti-S ratio:1.3 vs. 0.9, anti-RBD-specific ratio:2.3 vs. 0.7, P<0.001). Neutralizing antibodies placental transfer ratio was greater following early versus late 3rd trimester immunization (1.9 vs. 0.8, P<0.001), and was positively associated with longer duration from vaccination (r= 0.77; P<0.001). Conclusions Early- as compared to late third trimester maternal SARS-CoV-2 immunization enhanced transplacental antibody transfer and increased neonatal neutralizing antibody levels. Our findings highlight that vaccination of pregnant women early in the third trimester may optimize neonatal seroprotection.","Rottenstreich, A.; Zarbiv, G.; Oiknine-Djian, E.; Vorontsov, O.; Zigron, R.; Kleinstern, G.; Wolf, D.; Porat, S.",,87,1

Therefore, in this study, we take China as a specific and typical case and investigate its image with aspect-based sentiment analysis on a large-scale Twitter dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore country image in such a fine-grained way. To perform the analysis, we first build a manually-labeled Twitter dataset with aspect-level sentiment annotations. Afterward, we conduct the aspect-based sentiment analysis with BERT to explore the image of China. We discover an overall sentiment change from non-negative to negative in the general public, and explain it with the increasing mentions of negative ideology-related aspects and decreasing mentions of non-negative fact-based aspects. Further investigations into different groups of Twitter users, including U.S. Congress members, English media, and social bots, reveal different patterns in their attitudes toward China.

The article enlists how this pandemic is different from others in the sense that there is a differentiated impact on poor women. The differentiated impact is discussed under various themes, including ability to social distance, transportation implications, access to food and access to the COVID-19 relief grant. Access to COVID-19 grants and subsequent relief measures are assessed for their accessibility to poor women. The discussion engages the latest statistics available in 2020 during the pandemic and also reflects on what this means for the future. The article broadly explores the poverty gap and how this impacts poor women and looks at inequality in terms of labour demands on poor women during the pandemic. Finally, the article suggests some reforms that could be implemented going forward for poor women by government and other stakeholders, given that many cannot access their employment in a safe manner, and also looks at social reforms in terms of access to relief efforts for poor communities. Contribution: This article focuses on the most marginalised group of people in South African society affected by COVID-19, namely, poor women. The article provides a unique contribution by assessing the consequences of the pandemic and looks at possible recommendations for addressing the plight of poor women in South Africa post-COVID-19.","Ramparsad, N.",Hts Teologiese Studies-Theological Studies,87,23

Efforts to strengthen nutrition and food security is needed to build household food resilience (ie, being resourceful) more than ever as low-income families face unprecedented challenges due to the COVID pandemic. The rising food insecurity in California is concerning, which is linked to poor dietary outcomes and obesity. Parents recruited from low-income community settings in Tulare County, California. During FY2019-20, trained bilingual nutrition educator implemented the 9-week Expanded Food & Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) in English and Spanish using series-based adult curriculum Eating Smart Being Active. Each class was held once a week for 60-90 minutes in duration. Participants completed demographics questionnaire, Food Tracker dietary recall, and a pre-post Food & Physical Activity Questionnaire (FPAQ). Descriptive and Pre-Post analyses were completed using WebNEERS reporting tool. Of the total 149 program families reached, 136 participants who attended all the lessons graduated with a certificate. Majority of the participants were Hispanic. Differences in change from pre-to-post indicated improvements in all the program areas. Of the 136 graduates, 88% of participants showed improvement in 1 or more food resource management practices, 92% showed improvements in 1 or more diet quality/ nutrition practices, 88% showed improvements in 1 or more food safety practices, and 91% showed improvements in 1 or more physical activity behaviors. A noteworthy program impact was a random sample (n = 19) of these participants reported saving an average of $44.50 on food per month. The EFNEP program empower families to build household food resilience with knowledge and skills to adopt healthy practices in the areas of food resource management, food security, nutrition/physical activity, and food safety.

One of these fundamental rights is access to optimal health: physical activity is a key element in promoting and maintaining individual health and well-being. It is therefore necessary to guarantee full access to the right to health for all, also through a correct approach qualitative-quantitative to physical activities and sports, with particular attention to ""special"" populations (children, elderly, people with disabilities and more generally people who are vulnerable) which are more exposed to risk factors for health and well-being. The research activity aims to promote inclusion through physical and sports education programs able to respond to the needs for movement by ""special"" populations, needs that require specific and further adaptations according to the contingencies determined by the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose is also to describe and compare the behaviours implemented and the opinions expressed, as well as the system of norms, values, beliefs to which the subjects belonging to the selected sample of participants (disabled people that practice sport activities) in the survey activity in order to define physical and sports education programs adapted to the special needs for movement.","D039,; Elia, F.",Journal of Human Sport and Exercise,87,32

Objective. To examine the development dynamics and epidemic process manifestations of COVID-19 in healthcare workers as well as to assess the efficacy of intranasal human recombinant interferon alpha-2b (Grippferon®) for emergency medication-assisted nonspecific prevention of novel coronavirus infection. Patients and methods. The incidence of COVID-19 in Perm healthcare workers was examined using official statistical data in the epidemic dynamics. The prophylactic efficacy of Grippferon® was assessed in the analytic cohort prospective study, involving 561 healthcare workers of infectious diseases hospital departments. Results. The incidence rate of COVID-19 among healthcare workers in Perm for the examined period from 09.03.2020 to 06.12.2020 was four times higher, than in the general population. Healthcare workers aged 30–59 years were found to be more likely to develop COVID-19. Physicians had the highest risk of infection compared to other medical professionals. The pro phy lactic efficacy of Grippferon® was shown to be high in physicians and nurses, who were in contact with COVID-19 patients. Conclusion. Recombinant interferon alpha-2b-based medication Grippferon® can be recommended for emergency prevention of novel coronavirus infection to ensure epidemiological safety of healthcare workers and patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Feldblium, I.

Available data on the vaccine immune re-sponse developed by MF patients, and the impact of the treatment with the inhibitor of JAK-STAT signaling ruxolitimib, are still fragmented to support an informed decision for a third dose for this category of subjects. Here, we show that 76% of MF patients develop spike-specific IgG after the second vaccine dose, but the response has a slower kinetic compared to healthy subjects, suggesting a reduced capability of their immune system to promptly react to vaccina-tion. A reduced ACE2/RBD inhibition binding activity of spike-specific antibodies was also ob-served, especially in ruxolitimib treated patients. Our results contribute to answer the open question on the induction of the antibody responses in MF patients following vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, showing a slow kinetic that support the need for a third dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines.","Fiorino, F.; Sicuranza, A.; Ciabattini, A.; Santoni, A.; Pastore, G.; Simoncelli, M.; Polvere, J.; Galimberti, S.; Auddino, S.; Barate', C.; Montagnani, F.; Sammartano, V.; Bocchia, M.; Medaglini, D.",,87,1

Students reported that stay-at-home learning eroded support for their student role while also creating conflicts between the student role and other competing roles, such as child, sibling, or supplemental wage earner. As a result, they significantly lacked motivation to complete schoolwork during stay-at-home orders. Using a framework rooted in role identity theory, we analyze this role erosion and role conflict. Based on that analysis, we suggest potential actions for faculty to mitigate the adverse impact that this role erosion/conflict has on learning and, thus, bolster the student role while simultaneously reducing conflict between the student role and other competing roles. As we brace for multiple semesters of teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, such efforts to facilitate positive stay-at-home learning experiences for our students will contribute to determining our academic success and our educational institutions' economic viability.","Hvalshagen, M.; Nittala, L.; Raman, R.; Sullivan, N.; Zolbanin, H.

We aimed to evaluate the anxiety and loneliness levels of the quarantined individuals and determine the related factors. Materials and Methods: Two hundred ninety individuals who were brought to Turkey from abroad in May 2020, quarantined in Sakarya province, participated in our descriptive cross-sectional study. The loneliness and anxiety levels, along with the effects of the quarantine process, were evaluated. The sociodemographic information form prepared, Loneliness Scale (UCLA), State Anxiety Scale (STAI-1), and Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI-2), were used to collect data. Results: The mean age of the participants was 35.32±9.86 years and 79.7% were male. Participants who stated that they had a mental illness before the pandemic and those who reported that they needed a mental health professional during the pandemic scored significantly higher in the UCLA, STAI-1, and STAI-2 scales compared to others. The UCLA and STAI-2 scores of participants with a high concern about contracting COVID-19 were higher than those with moderate and low levels of anxiety. The quarantine process did not significantly affect the UCLA, STAI-1, and STAI-2 scales of participants. Conclusion: Although quarantine was not found to affect anxiety and loneliness levels, it was observed that the basis of anxiety in highly anxious individuals was constituted by worry about themselves or loved ones contracting the disease and economic effects of the process.","Etçioğlu, Erkut Aydın Abdülkadir Özen Feride Köse Elif Aydın Muhammet Raşit Muratdağı Gürkan Kılınçel Oğuzhan Kılınçel Şenay Hasan Çetin Ekerbiçer",Erciyes tıp dergisi = Erciyes Medical Journal,87,2

Unlike other situations, the context of the pandemic is characterized by large levels of threat and fear which largely affect the human decision-making process. To identify such characteristics, this study investigates the acceptance of exposure detection apps from the perspective of protection motivation theory (PMT). It examines how the perceived risk of Covid-19, perceived fear of Covid-19, self-efficacy, response efficacy and protection motivation interact to predict the acceptance of exposure detection apps. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 306 Jordanian participants, and structural equation modelling was used for data analysis. Findings: The results reveal that acceptance of these apps is triggered by the perceived risk of Covid-19, which increases the experienced level of fear. The latter then initiates a compelling desire or motivation to protect oneself by using the recommended adaptive response (exposure detection app). The results show that an increased level of self-efficacy and perceived efficacy of exposure detection apps also contribute to the development of protection motivation and later the intent to use exposure detection apps. Originality/value: This study contributes to the technology acceptance domain by developing a context-driven model of the key characteristics of pandemics that lead to different patterns of technology acceptance. The key components in designing effective marketing campaigns to prompt the use of exposures detection apps are discussed. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Alsaad, A.; Al-Okaily, M.",Information Technology and People,87,1

Healthcare workers (HWs), the main actors of the health system, are at higher-risk because of their occupation. Serology-based estaimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HWs represent a measure of HWs level of exposure to the virus and a guide to the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. This information is currently lacking in Ethiopia. This study aims to develop an in-house antibody testing assay and assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among Ethiopian high-risk front-line HWs. A cross-sectional seroprevalence study was conducted among HWs in five public hospitals located in different geographic regions of Ethiopia. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected using questionnaire-based interviews. From consenting HWs, blood samples were collected between December 2020 and February 2021, the period between the two peaks of COVID-19 in Ethiopia. The collected sera were tested using an in-house immunoglobin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies on sera collected from HWs. Of 1,997 HWs who provided a blood sample, demographic and clinical data, 50.5% were female, 74.0% had no symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and 29.0% had history of contact with suspected or confirmed patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overall seroprevalence was 39.6%. The lowest (24.5%) and the highest (48.0%) seroprevalence rates were found in Hiwot Fana Specialized Hospital in Harar and ALERT Hospital in Addis Ababa, respectively. Of the 821 seropositive HWs, 224(27.3%) had history of symptoms consistent with COVID-19. A history of close contact with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases was strongly associated with seropositivity (Adjusted odds Ratio (AOR) =1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.8; p=0.015). High SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence levels were observed in the five Ethiopian hospitals. These findings highlight the significant burden of asymptomatic infection in Ethiopia, and may reflect the scale of transmission in the general population.","Gelanew, T.; Seyoum, B.; Mulu, A.; Mihret, A.; Abebe, M.; Wassie, L.; Gelaw, B.; Sorsa, A.; Merid, Y.; Muchie, Y.; Teklemariam, Z.; Tesfaye, B.; Osman, M.; Jebessa, G.; Atinafu, A.; Hailu, T.; Habte, A.; Kenea, D.; Gadissa, A.; Admasu, D.; Tesfaye, E.; Bates, T.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 22-item online survey was e-mailed between the first and third months to TTS members, and participants’ responses were evaluated. RESULTS: The number of participants was 295 in the first survey and 141 in the second. In the second survey, the percentage of answers implying availability increased in all 18 control measures, 16 of which were statistically significant. However, there were still less than half of the respondents who reported the availability of psychological and behavioral support and some PPE, including respirators, facial protectors, goggles, and gowns. Statistical significance was observed for provision of a waiting area (P = .008), rooms for aerosol-gener-ating procedures (P = .042), and special wards for patients with suspected or definite COVID-19 (P &lt; .001);testing healthcare workers (HCWs) with a history of contact with a COVID-19 case (P &lt; .001);and surveillance of symptomatic HCWs (P = .048), between tertiary vs. primary and secondary healthcare facilities in the first survey, but provision of special wards (P = .002) and supply for aprons (P = .027) in the second survey. CONCLUSION: Our results showed an improvement in control measures in the third month of the pandemic. However, the persistent low availability of psychological and behavioral support and several items of PPE pointed out the need for action.

An Analysis of Citizens' Opinions in Italy,12.505802,4.2805624,2021,"The prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 varies greatly between populations. It is unclear whether such differences are due to factors at the level of the human host, or at the level of the coronavirus, or both. At the host level, the entry proteins which allow virus binding and entry have variants with distinct properties, and the frequency of such variants differs between ethnicities. At the level of the virus, the D614G mutation enhances virus entry to the host cell. Since the two virus strains (D614 and G614) co-existed in the first six months of the pandemic in most populations, it has been difficult to distinguish between contributions of the virus and contributions of the host for anosmia. To answer this question, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in South Asian populations when either the D614 or the G614 virus was dominant. We show that populations infected predominantly with the G614 virus had a much higher prevalence of anosmia (pooled prevalence of 31.8%) compared with the same ethnic populations infected mostly with the D614 virus strain (pooled anosmia prevalence of 5.3%). We conclude that the D614G mutation is a major contributing factor that increases the prevalence of anosmia in COVID-19, and that this enhanced effect on olfaction constitutes a previously unrecognized phenotype of the D614G mutation. The new virus strains that have additional mutations on the background of the D614G mutation can be expected to cause a similarly increased prevalence of chemosensory dysfunctions.","von Bartheld, C.

In recent years, dining out and ordering food online are increasingly popular, especially for urban residents. The aim of this study is to evaluate in the real-world context the effectiveness of different settings on a food delivery App in nudging consumers towards reduced salt options through a randomized controlled trial in selected cities and restaurants chains in China. Methods and Analysis: This is a randomized controlled trial with matched restaurants randomized to five parallel intervention groups plus a control group. Participating restaurants are recruited via open invitation and targeted invitation on a voluntary basis and are free to withdraw from the study at anytime. Each enrolled restaurant can select 1-3 of their most popular dishes to participate in this study. The recruitment ends at the end of June 2021. As of June 1, 322 restaurants enrolled for intervention groups and successfully completed interface set-up requirements. The primary outcome of this study is to investigate the differences in customer ordering behaviors regarding salt preference that result from changing the default settings and/or in combination with health messages before placing the order. The primary outcome will be measured by the difference between the number of regular salt orders and the number of reduced salt orders amongst the five intervention groups, and between each intervention group and the control group. We will collect order data at the end of the 2-month study period from the meal delivery App. The secondary outcome is to measure if reduced the salt version of the participating dishes has less salt content than the regular version. The secondary outcome will be measured by lab testing salt content of randomly sampled dishes during the study period. In addition, we will also conduct pre- and post- intervention surveys with participating restaurants to assess their knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding salt reduction, and their perceptions on how such intervention affects their business, if at all. We will not include findings from the pre- and post-intervention interviews as an outcome but will use them to inform future restaurant-based salt reduction promotions. Discussion: The study will test whether change in the choice architecture on the ordering platform will promote healthier ordering behavior among consumers. Results on whether user interface modifications can promote sales of reduced salt dishes may provide evidence to inform future sodium reduction strategies and health promotion interventions on online food ordering platforms, with the potential to apply to offline dining settings. The results may also inform current government efforts to roll out national guidelines on promoting nutrition labeling in dining settings. Despite these strengths in study design, securing the agreement of the food delivery App, recruiting individual restaurants and maintaining compliance to the interface set up through the period of the study proved to be and remains challenging.","Li, B.; Cui, Y.; Song, C.; Li, W.; Nakagawa, J.; Snider, P.; Liu, A.; Long, Y.; Galea, G.",,87,12

To date, the number of infections and deaths are still increasing. From the beginning of the pandemic, efforts were intensified to identify risk factors for development of the severe form of COVID-19. In this sense underlying medical comorbidities have been shown to have a worse prognosis in these patients. Objectives: In patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) and infected with Covid -19, we aim to investigate the role of systemic autoimmune conditions compared to other type of RMDs in severity of COVID-19 in terms of hospital admissions. Methods: An observational longitudinal study was conducted during the epidemic peak in Madrid (1stMar to 20thMay2020). All patients attended at the rheumatology outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital with a diagnosis of RMDs and COVID-19 infection were included (according to a medical diagnosis or confirmed with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostic test). All patients were included since the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Main variable: hospital admission related to Covid -19 infection. Independent variable: type of RMD including: autoimmune (systemic autoimmune conditions and inflammatory joint disease (IJD)) and nonautoimmune (mechanical diseases, and inflammatory diseases (microcrystalline arthritis and tendonitis)). Covariates: sociodemographic, clinical and therapy used. Statistical analysis: description of the sociodemographic, clinical and treatment characteristics of the patients. A multivariate logistic regression adjusted by age, sex and comorbidities was used to evaluate the risk of the different types of RMDs in hospital admissions related to Covid-19. The results were expressed as OR with its corresponding confidence interval (95% CI). Results: 406 patients were included with RMDs and Covid-19 infection. 69.21% were women with a mean age at diagnosis of 60 ± 15.26 years. The evolution time from the diagnosis of RMD was 8 ± 8.38 years. 26% had comorbidity at baseline. 25% were chronically on corticoids prior to the infection. Of the 406 patients, 244 (60.09%) had non-autoimmune RMD (157 mechanic, 87 inflammatory) and 162 (39.9%) (106 (65.43%) IJD, 56 (34.56%) systemic autoimmune condition) had autoimmune RMD. 36% of all patients were admitted (31% from not autoimmune RMDs and 43% from autoimmune RMD (p = 0,013). The risk of hospital admission in autoimmune RMD compared to non-autoimmune RMD was higher (OR: 1.68;[1.11-2.54], p=0.013), being the risk of systemic autoimmune condition compared to both IJD and non-autoimmune RMD higher (OR IJD: 0.41 [0.21-0.51], p=0.01;OR non-autoimmune: 0.33;[0.18-0.61];p=0.000). After adjusting by confounders, autoimmune RMD had higher risk of hospital admissions compared to the rest (OR: 1.75;[1.04-2.95];p=0.03), and specifically systemic autoimmune condition had higher risk compared to IJD (OR of IJD 0.33;[0.14-.076];p=0.009) and compared to non-autoimmune (OR non autoimmune 0.28;[0.13-0.59], p=0.001). Advanced age (OR: 1.10;[1.07-1.12], p<0.001), male (OR 0.58;[0.33-1.02], p=0.06), and more number of comorbidities (OR 1.39;[1.02-1.90] p=0.03) also increased the risk of hospitalization related to COVID-19. Conclusion: One third of the RMD patients infected with COVID-19 required hospital admission. This study shows that patients with autoimmune and specifically with systemic autoimmune conditions have a higher risk of hospitalization related to COVID-19. We also show that advanced age, male sex and a higher number of comorbidities can contribute to worsen the prognosis of the COVID-19 disease.","Perez-Sancristobal, I.; Lopez Pedraza, L.; Álvarez Hernandez, M.

Objective: Quantify associations of vaccination with ChAdOx1-S and BNT162b2 with major arterial, venous and thrombocytopenic events. Design: Cohort study based on linked electronic health records, with follow up from December 8th, 2020, to March 18th, 2021. Setting and participants: Adults registered with an NHS general practice in England and alive on December 8th, 2020. Exposures: First dose of vaccination with ChAdOx1-S and BNT162b2. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence rates and hazard ratios (HRs) for major arterial, venous and thrombocytopenic outcomes 1-28 and >28 days after first vaccination with ChAdOx1-S or BNT162b2 vaccine. Analyses were performed separately for ages <70 and [≥]70 years, and adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, and social and demographic factors. Results: Of 46,162,942 adults, 21,193,814 (46%) had their first vaccination during follow-up. Adjusted HRs 1-28 days after ChAdOx1-S, compared with pre-vaccination rates, at ages <70 and [≥]70 respectively, were 0.97 (95% CI: 0.9-1.05) and 0.58 (0.53-0.63) for venous thromboses, and 0.90 (0.86-0.95) and 0.76 (0.73-0.79) for arterial thromboses. Corresponding HRs for BNT162b2 were 0.81 (0.74-0.88) and 0.57 (0.53-0.62) for venous thromboses, and 0.94 (0.90-0.99) and 0.72 (0.70-0.75) for arterial thromboses. HRs for thrombotic events were higher at younger ages for venous thromboses after ChAdOx1-S, and for arterial thromboses after both vaccines. Rates of intracranial venous thrombosis (ICVT) and thrombocytopenia in adults aged <70 years were higher 1-28 days after ChAdOx1-S (adjusted HRs 2.27, 95% CI:1.33-3.88 and 1.71, 1.35-2.16 respectively), but not after BNT162b2 (0.59, 0.24-1.45 and 1.00, 0.75-1.34) compared with pre-vaccination. The corresponding absolute excess risks of ICVT 1-28 days after ChAdOx1-S were 0.9-3 per million, varying by age and sex. Conclusions and Relevance: Increases in ICVT and thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1-S vaccination in adults aged <70 years are small compared with its effect in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, although more precise estimates for adults <40 years are needed. For people aged [≥]70 years, rates of arterial or venous thrombotic, events were generally lower after either vaccine.","Whiteley, W.; Ip, S.; Cooper, J.

In place of a live advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) simulation, we implemented a virtual Zoombased simulation called virtual Code Lab. The purpose of this study is to describe the implementation of virtual Code Lab on Zoom and assess the effectiveness of the activity. METHODS: Second professional year Doctor of Pharmacy students received instruction in the required therapeutics courses related to ACLS and basic life support (BLS) principles. Prior to virtual Code Lab, students were required to successfully pass an online quiz to prepare them for the experience. During the virtual Code Lab, faculty instructors worked with small groups of students via Zoom navigating them through various cardiac arrest scenarios. Students were expected to demonstrate knowledge of arrhythmia identification, BLS principles, ACLS algorithms, and drug therapy including dosing and administration. A debrief was held at the end of each scenario to provide feedback regarding performance. Following the virtual Code Lab, an anonymous survey was sent to all students. A 5-point Likert scale was used to assess student assessment of the activities and their performance. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data and Chi-square test for categorical data. RESULTS: A total of 137 students participated in virtual Code Lab and 124 (90.5%) completed the survey. 80.7%, 75.6%, 86.3%, and 87% agreed/strongly agreed virtual Code Lab improved the ability to apply principles of CPR, interpret cardiac rhythms, apply ACLS algorithms, and understand the pharmacist's role during a code, respectively. 54.5% agreed/ strongly agreed they felt comfortable with making drug and non-drug recommendations prior to the virtual Code Lab versus 86.3% after the experience (p<0.00001). 89.5% agreed/strongly agreed virtual Code Lab improved their closed-loop communication skills as well. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, ACLS simulation was successfully conducted using Zoom for a virtual Code Lab experience. Students demonstrated they felt virtual Code Lab improved important skills required for a pharmacist during ACLS.","Whitman, C.; Bhajandas, N.",Critical Care Medicine,87,7

In healthcare, significant changes were made to reallocate resources to cater to an increasing number of hospital admissions and prevent infection spread. Reallocation of the health care staff led to the scarcity of care in outpatient facilities, including infusion centers, until the widespread adoption of Telehealth. Treating lung cancer patients with immunochemotherapy and radiotherapy has been incredibly challenging due to the pandemic, especially in regard to balancing malignancy treatment with limiting exposure of vulnerable patients to acute lifethreatening infection. In addition, being unable to provide appropriate treatment to cancer patients can result in decreased functional capacity, loss of treatment window, and increased mortality. A multidisciplinary approach can prevent these outcomes by anticipating challenges early and streamlining resources appropriately to provide better patient care. In this study, we aimed to assess the adherence of NCCN guidelines for lung cancer at a community hospital in Philadelphia during the pandemic. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed of patients diagnosed and receiving active treatment for primary lung cancer between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, at Mercy Catholic Medical Center. Fifty cases of primary lung cancer undergoing active treatment were identified. Type and staging of lung cancer, NCCN guidelines' adherence, COVID-19 exposure, and missed treatments were reviewed and analyzed. Results: Of the 50 cases reviewed, 92% had non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 8% had small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Among NSCLC, 72% had adenocarcinoma, 12% had squamous cell carcinoma, and 8% had large cell carcinoma. Stage IV lung cancer consisted of 46%, followed by 34% of stage I, 14% of stage III, and 6% of stage II. NCCN guideline-directed treatment was initiated in 88% (44/50) of the total patients, with the remaining 12% of the patients either refusing treatment (8%) or were lost to followup (4%). COVID-19 infection was diagnosed in 35% of the patients, of which 60% missed less than two chemotherapy sessions and 40% of COVID-19 positive patients who required hospitalization missed more than two cycles. 28% of patients missed treatment sessions due to other factors. This resulted in 61% (27/44) of patients having a disruption in NCCN guidelinedirected treatment at some point during the pandemic. Conclusions: Our study results reflect upon the need for developing effective strategies in managing cancer patients. When possible, switching to oral regimens, redefining regimen administration intervals, postponing invasive investigations for asymptomatic patients, and utilizing telemedicine as appropriate should be considered.","Paravathaneni, M.; Thota, V.; Baralo, B.; Mulla, S.; Choi, E.

Given the lack of empiric evidence on this phenomenon, we consider available evidence on cigarette smoking and respiratory droplet emission from mouth breathing through a mouthpiece as convenient proxies to infer the capacity of vaping to transport pathogens in respiratory droplets. Since both exhaled droplets and ECA droplets are within the Stokes regime, the ECA flow acts effectively as a visual tracer of the expiratory flow. To infer quantitatively the direct exposure distance, we consider a model that approximates exhaled ECA flow as an axially symmetric intermittent steady starting jet evolving into an unstable puff, an evolution that we corroborate by comparison with photographs and videos of actual vapers. On the grounds of all this theoretical modeling, we estimate for low-intensity vaping (practiced by 80–90% of vapers) the emission of 6–210 (median 39.9, median deviation 67.3) respiratory submicron droplets per puff and a horizontal distance spread of 1–2 m, with intense vaping possibly emitting up to 1000 droplets per puff in the submicron range with a distance spread over 2 m. The optical visibility of the ECA flow has important safety implications, as bystanders become instinctively aware of the scope and distance of possible direct contagion through the vaping jet.","Sussman, Roberto A.; Golberstein, Eliana Polosa Riccardo",Applied Sciences,87,1

The study used the CAMx-DDM air quality model by changing scenarios of pollutants emissions due to the prevention and control measures of the ""COVID-19"" pandemic in 2020. The simulation results show the negative sensitivity of O3 to NOx and the positive sensitivity to VOCs in Chengdu-Chongqing area. The higher sensitivity areas include the main urban area of Chongqing, the west of the main urban area, the southern urban agglomeration of Sichuan and the western part of Chengdu plain, due to their intensive distributions of pollution emission sources. For example, the average sensitivity of O3 hourly concentration to NOx and VOCs from March to April in 2019 is -19.14 μg•m-3and 7.25 μg•m-3 respectively in the main urban area of Chongqing. The result shows opposite diurnal variations because of the emissions from local and surrounding areas. The simulation results showed that under the condition of 25% reduction of VOCs emissions in these regions, the monthly mean ozone maximum 8-hour concentration in March and April decreased by 2.62 μg•m-3 and 3.59 μg•m-3, respectively. Sensitivity simulation results show that in March 2020, NOx emissions in Sichuan Province and Chongqing decreased by 8.00% and 22.40%, VOCs decreased by 1. 00% and 7.92%. In April, NOx emissions increased by 5.00% and 9.50% year on year, VOCs in Sichuan province were flat year on year, and VOCs in Chongqing increased by 3.63%, which was very consistent with the actual emissions caused by the prevention and control of the ""COVID-19"" epidemic and the recovery of production in the same period. © 2021, Science Press.

The degree of total service (adequacy of staff, reception) and the overall satisfaction regarding the facilities (organization and hygiene level of the supermarket) are the main factors influencing consumers’ decisions for their purchases. Other important components are the degree of coverage of needs in quality products, the intention to use an online store, the interest of consumers in finding quality and safe food, having at the same time information about their prices and possible offers. A quite important criterion is the degree of physical accessibility to the store. The main norm about using e-trade platforms instead of physical presence in supermarkets is quite low. It is tested though if there are significantly different approaches among customers of different firms, with no surprising results to be obtained. Customers familiarized with e-shopping, to a greater extent, are highly educated but quite sensitive to price issues as well.

185161,185161,185161,The safety catch.,12.68123,4.1600447,2007,"The diverse composition of mammalian tissues poses challenges for understanding the cell-cell interactions required for organ homeostasis and how spatial relationships are perturbed during disease. Existing methods such as single-cell genomics, lacking a spatial context, and traditional immunofluorescence, capturing only 2-6 molecular features, cannot resolve these issues. Imaging technologies have been developed to address these problems, but each possesses limitations that constrain widespread use. Here we report a new method that overcomes major impediments to highly multi-plex tissue imaging. Iterative Bleaching Extends multi-pleXity (IBEX) uses an iterative staining and chemical bleaching method to enable high resolution imaging of >65 parameters in the same tissue section without physical degradation. IBEX can be employed with various types of conventional microscopes and permits use of both commercially available and user-generated antibodies in an ‘open’ system to allow easy adjustment of staining panels based on ongoing marker discovery efforts. We show how IBEX can also be used with amplified staining methods for imaging strongly fixed tissues with limited epitope retention and with oligonucleotide-based staining, allowing potential cross-referencing between flow cytometry, Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-Seq), and IBEX analysis of the same tissue. To facilitate data processing, we provide an open source platform for automated registration of iterative images. IBEX thus represents a technology that can be rapidly integrated into most current laboratory workflows to achieve high content imaging to reveal the complex cellular landscape of diverse organs and tissues. Significance Statement Single cell flow cytometry and genomic methods are rapidly increasing our knowledge of the diversity of cell types in metazoan tissues. However, suitably robust methods for placing these cells in a spatial context that reveal how their localization and putative interactions contribute to tissue physiology and pathology are still lacking. Here we provide a readily accessible pipeline (IBEX) for highly multi-plex immunofluorescent imaging that enables a fine-grained analysis of cells in their tissue context. Additionally, we describe extensions of the IBEX workflow to handle hard to image tissue preparations and a method to facilitate direct integration of the imaging data with flow cytometry and sequencing technologies.","Radtke, Andrea J.; Kandov, Evelyn; Lowekamp, Bradley; Speranza, Emily; Chu, Colin J.; Gola, Anita; Thakur, Nishant; Shih, Rochelle; Yao, Li; Yaniv, Ziv Rafael; Beuschel, Rebecca T.; Kabat, Juraj; Croteau, Joshua; Davis, Jeremy; Hernandez, Jonathan M.; Germain, Ronald N.",bioRxiv,87,1

Generic drugs are those, sold without a brand name as they are not protected by trademark registration whereas branded have a specific name provided by the manufacturer. Hence, generics are cheaper version of brands with a profound bioequivalence profile. Conventional medicinal prospectus in country like India, does not attend to the essential feature of rational or generic prescription writing. One of the major reasons is the escalation of branded generics, that are sold at amounts adjacent to the innovator brands. This adds to the cost of pharmaceuticals in the country year by year. Time and again the consequence of generic prescribing has been emphasized to reduce the cost of drugs and in turn enhance the availability, of at least the essential drugs in all most all health care centers. Hence, it is vital to figure out the fundamental pharmaceutical concepts about branded, branded generic and generic drugs which impart a greater effect on patients' pocket and affect stakeholders in the field of health care. This review article will help in exploring and understanding these issues in a better way to allocate conversant pronouncement making for the profit of patients and society equally.

The objective of this study was to assess the impact COVID-19 on food access in Rhode Island (RI), document challenges encountered, and identify promising practices and policy solutions by conducting individual, 1-hour key stakeholder interviews from September-November 2020. Virtual qualitative interviews (n = 25) were conducted with 33 key stakeholders from 25 community organizations located throughout RI. This includes state/city agencies (n = 9), nonprofit organizations (n = 5), Health Equity Zone representatives (n = 5), food pantries/food bank (n = 4), a home-delivered meal program (n = 1), and a FQHC (n = 1) that primarily serve low-income and racial/ethnic minority populations. A structured interview guide was developed to capture scope of work, successes and challenges, and impact on health disparities including how organizations adjusted during COVID-19 to provide access to food safely. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically coded in NVivo with a priori codes to guide the analysis. An inductive and deductive approach was used to identify themes. Preliminary findings suggest that organizations struggled to meet food needs due to unemployment, lack of culturally relevant foods, insufficient resources (ie, funding, personal protective equipment, technology), and exacerbation of existing food access challenges connected to transportation and food storage needs. Despite these challenges, reported successes included enhanced collaboration between new and existing partnerships among stakeholders, increased effective communication among community stakeholders and the populations they serve, and increases in new initiatives to support food access needs. Our findings highlight the need to ensure a coordinated response through strategic leadership that has a focus on vulnerable racial/ethnic populations to ensure access to culturally appropriate food during emergency situations.

Prior work demonstrated that the 118-amino acid cytoplasmic domain is both necessary and sufficient for Golgi retention and that mutant or overexpressed DPAP A no longer retained in the Golgi was delivered directly to the vacuolar membrane (Roberts, C. J., S. F. Nothwehr, and T. H. Stevens. 1992. J. Cell Biol. 119:69-83). Replacement of the DPAP A transmembrane domain with a synthetic hydrophobic sequence did not affect either Golgi retention of DPAP A or vacuolar delivery of the retention-defective form of DPAP A. These results indicate that the DPAP A transmembrane domain is not involved in either Golgi retention or targeting of this membrane protein. A detailed mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A indicated that the most important elements for retention were within the eight residue stretch 85-92. A 10-amino acid region from DPAP A (81- 90) was sufficient for Golgi retention of alkaline phosphatase, a type II vacuolar membrane protein. Detailed mutational analysis within this 10-amino acid sufficient region demonstrated that a Phe-X-Phe-X-Asp motif was absolutely required for efficient retention. The efficiency of Golgi retention via the DPAP A signal could be diminished by overexpression of wild type but not retention-defective versions of Kex2p, another late Golgi membrane protein, suggesting that multiple Golgi membrane proteins may be retained by a common machinery. These results imply a role for a cytoplasmic signal involving aromatic residues in retention of late Golgi membrane proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",,J Cell Biol,87,19

Here, we have examined the biological effect of additional glycosylation on the virulence of H3N2 influenza viruses. We created otherwise isogenic reassortant viruses by site-directed mutagenesis that contain additional potential sites for glycosylation and examined the effect on virulence in naïve BALB/c, C57BL/6, and surfactant protein D (SP-D)-deficient mice. The introduction of additional sites was consistent with the sequence of acquisition in the globular head over the past 40 years, beginning with two sites in 1968 to the seven sites found in contemporary influenza viruses circulating in 2000. Decreased morbidity and mortality, as well as lower viral lung titers, were seen in mice as the level of potential glycosylation of the viruses increased. This correlated with decreased evidence of virus-mediated lung damage and increased in vitro inhibition of hemagglutination by SP-D. SP-D-deficient animals displayed an inverse pattern of disease, such that more highly glycosylated viruses elicited disease equivalent to or exceeding that of the wild type. We conclude from these data that increased glycosylation of influenza viruses results in decreased virulence, which is at least partly mediated by SP-D-induced clearance from the lung. The continued exploration of interactions between highly glycosylated viruses and surfactant proteins may lead to an improved understanding of the biology within the lung and strategies for viral control.","Vigerust, David J; Ulett, Kimberly B; Boyd, Kelli L; Madsen, Jens; Hawgood, Samuel; McCullers, Jonathan A",Journal of virology,87,11

The most common helminthic infections that can cause eosinophilic meningitis (EoM) in the US, neuroangiostrongyliasis and baylisascariasis, share many of the characteristics of emerging infectious diseases. Neuroangiostrongyliasis, a rodent zoonosis caused by the rat lungworm, Angiostrongylus cantonensis, is now endemic in the US following the importation of infected rats on container ships and African land snails, the parasite's intermediate hosts, as biological controls and exotic pets. Baylisascariasis, a raccoon zoonosis, caused by the raccoon roundworm, Baylisascaris procyonis, has extended its US distribution range from suburban neighborhoods in the northern US to the Southeast and West Coast since the 1980s. Both A. cantonensis and B. procyonis are now enzootic in Louisiana and have caused EoM in humans. This review analyzes scientific articles selected by MEDLINE search, 1966-2008, in order to assess the evolving epidemiology of EoM in the US, and specifically in Louisiana; and to alert Louisiana clinicians to populations at increased risk of helminthic EoM as a result of age, ethnicity, lifestyle, food choices, location of permanent residence, or recent travel in the Americas or Caribbean.

Such a potential is already known for rabies encephalitis since seven out of the eight genotypes of Lyssavirus are transmitted by bats. In addition, phylogenetic reconstructions indicate that Lyssavirus have evolved in chiropters before their emergence in carnivores. Nevertheless, carnivores remain the most critical vectors for public health, in particular dogs that are originating 55.000 rabies deaths per year, essentially in developing countries. Rabies control in carnivores by parenteral (dog) or oral (wild carnivores) vaccination is efficacious and campaigns start to be more widely applied. On the other hand, rabies control in bat still remains non realistic, particularly as the pathogenicity of bat Lyssavirus for bats is still under debate, suggesting that a ""diplomatic relationship"" between partners would have arisen from a long term cohabitation. While comparing the interactions that humans and bats establish with Lyssavirus, scientists try to understand the molecular basis ofpathogenicity in man, a indispensable prerequisite to identify antiviral targets in a perspective of therapy.","Tordo, N; Marianneau, M Ph",Bulletin et memoires de l'Academie royale de medecine de Belgique,87,7

It may progress to respiratory failure, and a significant proportion of patients die. Preliminary data suggest that a high viral load of the SARS coronavirus is associated with adverse outcomes in the intensive care unit, but the relation of viral load to survival is unclear. METHODS We prospectively studied an inception cohort of 133 patients with virologically confirmed SARS who were admitted to 2 general acute care hospitals in Hong Kong from Mar. 24 to May 4, 2003. The patients were followed until death or for a minimum of 90 days. We used Cox proportional hazard modelling to analyze potential predictors of survival recorded at the time of presentation, including viral load from nasopharyngeal specimens (measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [PCR] of the SARS-associated coronavirus). RESULTS Thirty-two patients (24.1%) met the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 24 patients (18.0%) died. The following baseline factors were independently associated with worse survival: older age (61-80 years) (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 5.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.03-13.53), presence of an active comorbid condition (adjusted HR 3.36, 95% CI 1.44-7.82) and higher initial viral load of SARS coronavirus, according to quantitative PCR of nasopharyngeal specimens (adjusted HR 1.21 per log10 increase in number of RNA copies per millilitre, 95% CI 1.06-1.39). INTERPRETATION We found preliminary evidence that higher initial viral load is independently associated with worse prognosis in SARS. Mortality data for patients with SARS should be interpreted in light of age, comorbidity and viral load. These considerations will be important in future studies of SARS.","Chu, Chung-Ming; Poon, Leo L M; Cheng, Vincent C C; Chan, Kin-Sang; Hung, Ivan F N; Wong, Maureen M L; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Leung, Wah-Shing; Tang, Bone S F; Chan, Veronica L; Ng, Woon-Leung; Sim, Tiong-Chee; Ng, Ping-Wing; Law, Kin-Ip; Tse, Doris M W; Peiris, Joseph S M; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,87,28

MATERIALS AND METHODS Blood donors were recruited into four distinct groups [non-exposed (control), malarial area 'visitors', 'residents' and 'previous infection') and screened by using the Newmarket malarial antibody EIA. Assay specificity was evaluated in unexposed blood donors, and sensitivity was determined in acute clinical samples. RESULTS No parasitaemic donors were detected amongst 337 malarial 'visitors' who had returned from a malaria-endemic area less than 6 months previously, or for 402 'visitors' or 'residents' who had returned from a malaria-endemic area more than 6 months previously. The incidence of malarial antibodies within the exposed blood donor groups was 1.33% (10/751). In acute clinical non-donor samples, the Newmarket EIA detected 106/108 (98.1; 93.5-99.5%) 'film' positive Plasmodium falciparum infections and 12/12 (100, 75.7-100.0%) P. vivax infections. The estimated additional risk exposure of the proposed new strategy was one infectious P. falciparum donation per 175 years or 1 per 4.2 years for P. vivax. CONCLUSIONS The study findings support the efficacy and safety of a targeted screening strategy combining antibody screening with a 6-month cellular component restriction period for donors with a declared malarial risk.","Seed, C R; Cheng, A; Davis, T M E; Bolton, W V; Keller, A J; Kitchen, A; Cobain, T J",Vox sanguinis,87,1

Accumulating evidence from in vitro and in vivo observations is consistent with the neurotropism of these viruses in humans. To verify the possibility of a persistent infection within the central nervous system (CNS), various human cell lines of neural origin were tested for their ability to maintain chronic infection by both known strains of HCV, OC43 and 229E. Production of infectious progeny virions was monitored by an immunoperoxydase assay on a susceptible cell line and viral RNA was observed after RT-PCR. Astrocytic cell lines U-373 MG and U-87 MG did not sustain a persistent HCV-229E infection, even though they were susceptible to an acute infection by this virus. On the other hand, these two cell lines could maintain a persistent infection by HCV-OC43 for as many as 25 cell passages (about 130 days of culture). Relatively stable titers of infectious viral particles, as well as apparently constant amounts of viral RNA were detected throughout the persistent infection of U-87 MG cells. However, persistent infection of U-373 MG cells was accompanied by the detection of infectious viral particles from passage 0 to passage 13 and then from passage 20 to the end of the experiment. This gap in the production of infectious virions was correlated by a drop in the apparent amount of viral RNA detected at passages 15 and 20. These results confirm the ability of HCV-OC43 to persistently infect cells of an astrocytic lineage and, together with our previous observations of HCV infection of primary cultures of human astrocytes and the detection of HCV RNA in human brains, are consistent with the possibility that this human coronavirus could persist in the human CNS by targeting astrocytes.","Arbour, N; Talbot, P J",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,87,19

In Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (HiP), a small, enclosed reserve in South Africa, a large lion (Panthera leo) population arose from a small founder group in the 1960s and started showing conspicuous signs of inbreeding. To restore the health status of the HiP lion population, outbred lions were translocated into the existing population. In this study, we determined the susceptibility to bovine tuberculosis (bTB), and the prevalence of antibody to feline viruses of native lions, and compared the findings with those from translocated outbred lions and their offspring. Antibodies to feline herpesvirus, feline calicivirus, feline parvovirus, and feline coronavirus were present in the lion population, but there was no significant difference in antibody prevalence between native and translocated lions and their offspring, and these feline viruses did not appear to have an effect on the clinical health of HiP lions. However, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), which was previously absent from HiP, appears to have been introduced into the lion population through translocation. Within 7 yr, the prevalence of antibody to FIV increased up to 42%. Bovine tuberculosis posed a major threat to the inbred native lion population, but not to translocated lions and their offspring. More than 30% of the native lion population died from bTB or malnutrition compared with <2% of the translocated lions and their offspring. We have demonstrated that management of population genetics through supplementation can successfully combat a disease that threatens population persistence. However, great care must be taken not to introduce new diseases into populations through translocation.","Trinkel, Martina; Cooper, Dave; Packer, Craig; Slotow, Rob",Journal of wildlife diseases,87,8

These homology models reveal three distinct functional domains as well as an intervening loop connecting domains II and III as found in both template proteins. A catalytic cleft containing the substrate binding sites S1 and S2 between domains I and II are also observed. S2 undergoes more significant structural fluctuation than S1 during the 400 ps molecular dynamics simulations because it is located at the open mouth of the catalytic cleft, while S1 is situated in the very bottom of this cleft. The thermal unfolding of these proteins begins at domain III, where the structure is least conserved among these proteins. Mpro may still maintain its proteolytic activity while it is partially unfolded.

METHODS Twenty-five SARS patients with respiratory dysfunction treated with NIPPV were studied retrospectively in order to evaluate the influences within 24 hours after initiation of ventilatory support on their physiological indices and oxygenation. Patients with SARS were divided into two groups: survivor group (n=13) and non-survivor group (n=12). We compared the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHEII) score, respiratory rate (RR),saturation of oxygen (SpO(2)) and modificative respiratory index (MRI) for the survivors and non-survivors before NIPPV and after NIPPV for twenty-four hours, respectively. RESULTS Although NIPPV administered via full-face masks might be an effective treatment for rapidly improving vital signs and gas exchange and sense of dyspnea in both groups during the initial 24 hours of ventilatory support, the patients in non-survivor group had higher APACHEII score, respiratory rates and lower SpO(2), MRI than the patients in survivor group (P<0.05) at the same intervals after initiation of support. CONCLUSION Noninvasive ventilation should be used as a substitutive tool for endotracheal intubation an alternative treatment for acute respiratory failure related to SARS. Therefore, we should make efforts to avoid missing the time point for NIPPV or intubation, and we should not be restricted to the available indications for NIPPV or IPPV.","Chen, Hong; Wang, Xiang-ping; Li, Fei; Yang, Qiang; Zhang, Lian-guo; Du, Jian-xin; Zhao, Song-lin",Zhongguo wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue = Chinese critical care medicine = Zhongguo weizhongbing jijiuyixue,87,16

The high transmissibility of the virus combined with PPE shortages made this an even more difficult task. A Catholic health system in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, embraced healthcare technology in order to bridge the gap between providing patient care, exposure to the virus, and lack of PPE. To treat COVID-19 patients, they developed a COVID clinic that provides triage, testing, and a hospital-at-home service. The service uses Health Recovery Solution devices to monitor more symptomatic or high-risk patients and provide real-time health data to physicians at a remote site, keeping stable COVID patients out of the hospital while still providing quality care. They also embraced telemedicine across all primary care and subspecialties, increasing the use of the AveraNow platform from less than 50 virtual visits per day to more than 1,000 per day. In long term care, the organization implemented multiple forms of healthcare technology, including TYTO Care devices, the Polycom RealPresence device, and doxy.me services to continue to provide care to these extremely high-risk patients. In the arguably most at-risk environment, the emergency department, the health system was able to use their eCARE emergency video call system to reduce the amount of staff exposed to COVID patients and allow physicians to minimize their exposure while still being able to communicate with patients and perform necessary procedures. Hopefully health systems that have yet to embrace telemedicine or other forms of healthcare technology can use this organization's model to implement changes, especially in the face of uncertainty regarding whether coronavirus will peak again, and whether that peak will be even higher than the surge already seen throughout the U.S.","Motz, Alexis R; Rhone, Kelly; Burchett, Andrew",South Dakota medicine : the journal of the South Dakota State Medical Association,87,1

We sought to evaluate the utility of the twinkling artifact produced by inguinal mesh to assist in mesh identification. METHODS Two reviewers evaluated focused sonographic examinations of 44 inguinal regions, 24 of which had implanted inguinal mesh. The sonographic examinations consisted of static gray scale and color Doppler images with both linear and curvilinear array transducers. The presence of the twinkling artifact and visibility of the mesh were graded on a 4-point visibility scale. RESULTS Inguinal mesh was not easily identified on gray scale imaging using either the curvilinear array (P = .5) or linear array (P = .5) transducer. The mesh was definitely seen in 3 of 24 inguinal regions using the linear array transducer and 2 of 24 inguinal regions using the curvilinear array transducer. In 79% of inguinal regions with mesh, the twinkling artifact was produced with the curvilinear array transducer only. The artifact was not elicited when using the linear array transducer. With the use of the curvilinear array transducer and the presence of the twinkling artifact, there was a significant chance of correctly identifying the presence of mesh (P < .005) in the entire study group. CONCLUSIONS Standard gray scale imaging alone is not reliable when identifying inguinal mesh. The twinkling artifact was present in 79% of inguinal regions with mesh when evaluated with a low-frequency curvilinear array transducer.","Girish, Gandikota; Caoili, Elaine M; Pandya, Amit; Dong, Qian; Franz, Michael G; Morag, Yoav; Higgins, Ellen J; Rubin, Jonathan M; Jamadar, David A",Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine,87,24

Without sufficient knowledge about the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), it is impossible to define the candidate for the anti-SARS targets. The putative non-structural protein 2 (nsp2) (3CL(pro), following the nomenclature by Gao et al, also known as nsp5 in Snidjer et al) of SARS-CoV plays an important role in viral transcription and replication, and is an attractive target for anti-SARS drug development, so we carried on this study to have an insight into putative polymerase nsp2 of SARS-CoV Guangdong (GD) strain. METHODS The SARS-CoV strain was isolated from a SARS patient in Guangdong, China, and cultured in Vero E6 cells. The nsp2 gene was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and cloned into eukaryotic expression vector pCI-neo (pCI-neo/nsp2). Then the recombinant eukaryotic expression vector pCI-neo/nsp2 was transfected into COS-7 cells using lipofectin reagent to express the nsp2 protein. The expressive protein of SARS-CoV nsp2 was analyzed by 7% sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The nucleotide sequence and protein sequence of GD nsp2 were compared with that of other SARS-CoV strains by nucleotide-nucleotide basic local alignment search tool (BLASTN) and protein-protein basic local alignment search tool (BLASTP) to investigate its variance trend during the transmission. The secondary structure of GD strain and that of other strains were predicted by Garnier-Osguthorpe-Robson (GOR) Secondary Structure Prediction. Three-dimensional-PSSM Protein Fold Recognition (Threading) Server was employed to construct the three-dimensional model of the nsp2 protein. RESULTS The putative polymerase nsp2 gene of GD strain was amplified by RT-PCR. The eukaryotic expression vector (pCI-neo/nsp2) was constructed and expressed the protein in COS-7 cells successfully. The result of sequencing and sequence comparison with other SARS-CoV strains showed that nsp2 gene was relatively conservative during the transmission and total five base sites mutated in about 100 strains investigated, three of which in the early and middle phases caused synonymous mutation, and another two base sites variation in the late phase resulted in the amino acid substitutions and secondary structure changes. The three-dimensional structure of the nsp2 protein was successfully constructed. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that polymerase nsp2 is relatively stable during the phase of epidemic. The amino acid and secondary structure change may be important for viral infection. The fact that majority of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) are predicted to cause synonymous, as well as the result of low mutation rate of nsp2 gene in the epidemic variations, indicates that the nsp2 is conservative and could be a target for anti-SARS drugs. The three-dimensional structure result indicates that the nsp2 protein of GD strain is high homologous with 3CL(pro) of SARS-CoV urbani strain, 3CL(pro) of transmissible gastroenteritis virus and 3CL(pro) of human coronavirus 229E strain, which further suggests that nsp2 protein of GD strain possesses the activity of 3CL(pro).","Lu, Jia-hai; Zhang, Ding-mei; Wang, Guo-ling; Guo, Zhong-min; Zhang, Chuan-hai; Tan, Bing-yan; Ouyang, Li-ping; Lin, Li; Liu, Yi-min; Chen, Wei-qing; Ling, Wen-hua; Yu, Xin-bing; Zhong, Nan-shan",Chinese medical journal,87,1

The end point of both WHO-HKU and WHO-Hamburg RT-PCR assays was determined to be 0.1 50% tissue culture infective dose. Using seroconversion to CoV as the ""gold standard"" for SARS CoV diagnosis, WHO-HKU and WHO-Hamburg RT-PCR assays exhibited diagnostic sensitivities of 61 and 68% (nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens), 65 and 72% (throat swab specimens), 50 and 54% (urine specimens), and 58 and 63% (stool specimens), respectively, with an overall specificity of 100%. For patients confirmed to have SARS CoV and from whom two or more respiratory specimens were collected, testing the second specimen increased the sensitivity from 64 and 71% to 75 and 79% for the WHO-HKU and WHO-Hamburg RT-PCR assays, respectively. Testing more than one respiratory specimen will maximize the sensitivity of PCR assays for SARS CoV.","Yam, W C; Chan, K H; Poon, L L M; Guan, Y; Yuen, K Y; Seto, W H; Peiris, J S M",Journal of clinical microbiology,87,31

Our objective was to document the experiences of these front-line health care professionals during the pandemic. DESIGN: Electronic survey of long-term care staff. This report summarizes qualitative data from open-ended questions for the subset of respondents working in nursing homes. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 152 nursing home staff from 32 states, including direct-care staff and administrators. METHODS: From May 11 through June 4, 2020, we used social media and professional networks to disseminate an electronic survey with closed- and open-ended questions to a convenience sample of long-term care staff. Four investigators identified themes from qualitative responses for staff working in nursing homes. RESULTS: Respondents described ongoing constraints on testing and continued reliance on crisis standards for extended use and reuse of personal protective equipment. Administrators discussed the burden of tracking and implementing sometimes confusing or contradictory guidance from numerous agencies. Direct-care staff expressed fears of infecting themselves and their families, and expressed sincere empathy and concern for their residents. They described experiencing burnout due to increased workloads, staffing shortages, and the emotional burden of caring for residents facing significant isolation, illness, and death. Respondents cited the presence or lack of organizational communication and teamwork as important factors influencing their ability to work under challenging circumstances. They also described the demoralizing impact of negative media coverage of nursing homes, contrasting this with the heroic public recognition given to hospital staff. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Nursing home staff described working under complex and stressful circumstances during the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges have added significant burden to an already strained and vulnerable workforce and are likely to contribute to increased burnout, turnover, and staff shortages in the long term.","White, Elizabeth M; Wetle, Terrie Fox; Reddy, Ann; Baier, Rosa R",J Am Med Dir Assoc,87,1

Substantial reduction in availability of substances would present a unique opportunity to consider the supply-side hypothesis that reductions in drug availability will lead to reductions in drug prevalence. METHODS: Longitudinal data come from Monitoring the Future and are based on responses from 582 adolescents who were originally surveyed as part of a national sample of 12th grade students in early 2020, one month before social distancing policies began. They were surveyed again after social distancing policies were implemented, in the summer of 2020. RESULTS: Perceived availability of marijuana and alcohol declined across the two survey waves at the largest levels ever recorded in the 46 years of the project, by an absolute 17 %, p < .01 and 24 %, p < .01, respectively. Despite these declines, prevalence levels did not significantly change across the two waves for marijuana use in the past 30 days or for binge drinking in the past two weeks. Perceived availability of vaping devices significantly declined, from 73 % to 63 %, as did nicotine vaping prevalence in the past 30 days, from 24 % to 17 %. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived availability of marijuana, alcohol, and vaping devices declined at historic rates during the pandemic of 2020. Lack of accompanying reductions in prevalence for marijuana and binge drinking demonstrates the substantial challenges facing a supply-side approach to the reduction of adolescent use of these substances.","Miech, Richard; Patrick, Megan E; Keyes, Katherine; O039,; Malley, Patrick M; Johnston, Lloyd",Drug Alcohol Depend,87,11

In Turkey, long quarantine periods and curfews have increased both physical and psychological problems. Due to the rapid spread and substantial impact of the COVID-19 virus, different psychological effects were observed among different segments of society, such as among young people, elderly people, and active workers. Because of fear caused by the COVID-19 virus, it is thought that depression, stress, and anxiety levels have increased. It is estimated that there are more psychological issues for people with poor health and others whose friends or family became ill or have died because of COVID-19. To explore and test the situation mentioned above, we conducted a cross-sectional study in Turkey with 3287 participants above 16 years old. We measured COVID-19 fear, along with anxiety, stress, and depression levels (DASS21) and demographics. Firstly, we tested whether COVID-19 fear predicts stress, anxiety, and depression. Secondly, we investigated if the effect of COVID-19 fear is stronger for those who have underlying illness and for those whose friends or family became ill or have died because of COVID-19. The results showed that women and 16-25 years old youths have higher COVID-19-related fear, anxiety, depression, and stress. Furthermore, we found a significant relationship between COVID-19 fear and stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as significant moderation effects of having an underlying illness and having friends or family who were infected or have died. These results show the importance of implementing specific implementations, particularly for vulnerable groups, to minimize the psychological problems that may arise with the pandemic.","Koçak, Orhan; Koçak, Ömer Erdem; Younis, Mustafa Z",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),87,7

There is still no consensus on whether solid organ transplantation (SOT) recipients with COVID-19 are at greater risk of developing severe or fatal COVID-19. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association between SOT, severe COVID-19 illness, and mortality. METHODS: A systemically comprehensive search in Pubmed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure was performed for relevant studies and articles. Consequently, we pooled the odds ratio (OR) from individual studies and performed heterogeneity, quality assessment and subgroup/sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: A total number of 15 articles with 265,839 participants were included in this study. Among the total number of participants, 1485 were SOT recipients. The meta-analysis results showed that transplant patients with COVID-19 were remarkably associated with a higher risk of intensive care unit admission than non-transplant patients (ORâ¯=â¯1.57, 95%CI: 1.07 to 2.31, Pâ¯=â¯0.02). On the other hand, there were no statistically significant differences between SOT recipients and non-SOT recipients in mechanical ventilation need (ORâ¯=â¯1.55, 95%CI: 0.98 to 2.44, Pâ¯=â¯0.06). In addition, we found that SOT recipients with COVID-19 had 1.40-fold increased odds of mortality than non-SOT recipients (ORâ¯=â¯1.40, 95%CI: 1.10 to 1.79, Pâ¯=â¯0.007). Moreover, pooled analysis of adjusted results revealed that SOT recipients had a greater risk of mortality compared with non-SOT patients (HRâ¯=â¯1.54, 95%CI: 1.03 to 2.32, Pâ¯=â¯0.037). LIMITATIONS: The main limitations in our study are attributed to the relatively small sample size, short follow-up period, and the fact that most of the studies included were retrospective in design. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that SOT recipients with COVID-19 had a more significant risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality than the general population.","Ao, Guangyu; Wang, Yushu; Qi, Xin; Nasr, Basma; Bao, Mulong; Gao, Ming; Sun, Ying; Xie, Dili",Transplant Rev (Orlando),87,16

Mendelian Randomization (MR) may overcome the limitations of observational studies, e.g., unmeasured confounding and uncertainties about cause and effect. We aimed to elucidate associations between neuropsychiatric disorders and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. To that end, we applied a two-sample, bidirectional, univariable, and multivariable MR design to genetic data from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of neuropsychiatric disorders and COVID-19 phenotypes (released in January 2021). In single-variable Generalized Summary MR analysis, the most significant and only Bonferroni-corrected significant result was found for genetic liability to BIP-SCZ (a combined GWAS of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia as cases vs. controls) increasing risk of COVID-19 (OR = 1.17, 95% CI, 1.06-1.28). However, we found a significant, positive genetic correlation between BIP-SCZ and COVID-19 of 0.295 and could not confirm causal or horizontally pleiotropic effects using another method. No genetic liabilities to COVID-19 phenotypes increased the risk of (neuro)psychiatric disorders. In multivariable MR using both neuropsychiatric and a range of other phenotypes, only genetic instruments of BMI remained causally associated with COVID-19. All sensitivity analyses confirmed the results. In conclusion, while genetic liability to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia combined slightly increased COVID-19 susceptibility in one univariable analysis, other MR and multivariable analyses could only confirm genetic underpinnings of BMI to be causally implicated in COVID-19 susceptibility. Thus, using MR we found no consistent proof of genetic liabilities to (neuro)psychiatric disorders contributing to COVID-19 liability or vice versa, which is in line with at least two observational studies. Previously reported positive associations between psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 by others may have resulted from statistical models incompletely capturing BMI as a continuous covariate.","Luykx, Jurjen J; Lin, Bochao D",Transl Psychiatry,87,1

PCR screening is the adopted diagnostic testing method for COVID-19 detection. However, PCR is criticized due its low sensitivity ratios, also, it is time-consuming and manual complicated process. CT imaging proved its ability to detect the disease even for asymptotic patients, which make it a trustworthy alternative for PCR. In addition, the appearance of COVID-19 infections in CT slices, offers high potential to support in disease evolution monitoring using automated infection segmentation methods. However, COVID-19 infection areas include high variations in term of size, shape, contrast and intensity homogeneity, which impose a big challenge on segmentation process. To address these challenges, this paper proposed an automatic deep learning system for COVID-19 infection areas segmentation. The system include different steps to enhance and improve infection areas appearance in the CT slices so they can be learned efficiently using the deep network. The system start prepare the region of interest by segmenting the lung organ, which then undergo edge enhancing diffusion filtering (EED) to improve the infection areas contrast and intensity homogeneity. The proposed FCN is implemented using U-net architecture with modified residual block with concatenation skip connection. The block improves the learning of gradient values by forwarding the infection area features through the network.

We propose the automatic annotation of phenotypes from clinical notes as a method to capture essential information to predict outcomes in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). This information is complementary to typically used vital signs and laboratory test results. We demonstrate and validate our approach conducting experiments on the prediction of in-hospital mortality, physiological decompensation and length of stay in the ICU setting for over 24,000 patients. The prediction models incorporating phenotypic information consistently outperform the baseline models leveraging only vital signs and laboratory test results. Moreover, we conduct a thorough interpretability study, showing that phenotypes provide valuable insights at the patient and cohort levels. Our approach illustrates the viability of using phenotypes to determine outcomes in the ICU.","Zhang, Jingqing; Bolanos, Luis; Tanwar, Ashwani; Sokol, Albert; Ive, Julia; Gupta, Vibhor; Guo, Yike",,87,1

Institutions took a variety of approaches to ""uptraining"" such providers though studies describing methods and effectiveness are lacking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and seventy-five providers underwent a 3 h simulation-based session focused on management of shock, mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and critical care ultrasound. All participants were sent surveys to assess their comfort with various aspects of critical care following return to their usual work environments. RESULTS: One hundred and eight providers of 175 (62%) completed the survey. Overall, 104/108 responders (96%) felt training either significantly or somewhat improved their knowledge in the management of ICU patients. Responders felt most comfortable in the management of hypoxemia in intubated patients and the management of ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (93% strongly agree or agree, and 86% strongly agree or agree, respectively). Fewer responders felt more comfortable using focused echocardiography (70% strongly agree or agree) and lung ultrasonography in following progression of COVID-19 (76% strongly agree or agree).

By using one-step RT-ddPCR, 92.3% (48 of 52) of this cohort was quantitatively detected with viremia. The concordance between the blood and oropharyngeal swab tests was 60.92% (53 of 87). One-step RT-ddPCR was tested with a 3.03% false-positive rate and lower 50% confidence interval of detection at 54.026 copies/mL plasma. In all critical patients, the blood viral load was not eliminated, whereas the general and severe patients exhibited a similar ability to clear the viral load. The viral loads in critical patients were significantly higher than those in their general and severe counterparts. Among the 52 study patients, 30 (58%) were discharged from the hospital. Among half of the 30 discharged patients, blood viral load remained positive, of which 76.9% (10 of 13) completely cleared their blood viral load at follow-up.

There are several factors that, potentially, can contribute to the differentiated impact of COVID-19, and explain the disparities seen among areas. This study aims to contribute to this debate by analysing the role of health system and social trust in lessening the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in French départements. METHODS: The data used in this study have been provided by the INSEE and the French Ministry of Health. Database is made up of the 96 départements of metropolitan France. We use spatial analysis techniques to identify the groups of areas that are particularly affected, and to test the influence of local socioeconomic factors on the spread of the epidemic. RESULTS: Our exploratory spatial analysis reveals the heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation of the disease. The use of spatial econometric models, then, allows us to highlight the impact of emergency services, and social capital in reducing the exposition to Covid-19. Our results also report on the role of spillover effects between neighbouring areas. CONCLUSIONS: This research shows that, although individual characteristics are important factors in explaining the probability of contracting Covid-19 desease, health care services and social trust factors also play a significant role in curbing the epidemic's outbreak. These findings should have an interest for policy makers in the prevention of future waves of Covid-19 pandemic.","Amdaoud, Mounir; Arcuri, Giuseppe; Levratto, Nadine",Eur. j. public health,87,16

METHODS: This 8-week webinar series ran from July 1 to August 28, 2020. An optional exit survey was distributed to participants. Data were analyzed to characterize and better understand trends among a global cohort of participants. RESULTS: A total of 16,484 people registered for BRAINterns, and 6675 took the survey (40.5% response rate). Responders represented 87 countries, of which the majority were from the United States and Canada (90.48%, n = 6039). Responders were primarily female (82.9%, n = 5521). Racial and ethnic representation was majority Asian (42%, n = 2798), followed by White (22.7%, n = 1514), Hispanic/Latino (16.2%, n = 1080), and Black and African American (7.7%, n = 516). Participants reported hearing about BRAINterns through various social media platforms (72.18%, n = 4818)-the most popular was TikTok (33.4%, n = 2232). Overall, 93.4% of participants reported that the course was a good use of their time during the pandemic, and 86.7% reported that the course helped replace lost opportunities. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that webinar-based education is an effective method of expanding access to careers in medicine and in particular, neurosurgery, to traditionally underrepresented populations.

If information about this correlation is lacking, an agent may find it desirable to make a decision that is robust to possible correlations. Our main results characterize the strategies that are robust to possible hidden correlations. In particular, with two states and two actions, the robustly optimal strategy pays attention to a single information source, ignoring all others. More generally, the robustly optimal strategy may need to combine multiple information sources, but can be constructed quite simply by using a decomposition of the original problem into separate decision problems, each requiring attention to only one information source. An implication is that an information source generates value to the agent if and only if it is best for at least one of these decomposed problems.","Oliveira, Henrique de; Ishii, Yuhta; Lin, Xiao",,87,12

Thus, there is a need for efficient devices to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection at an early stage. Nowadays, the RT-PCR technique is being applied for detecting this virus around the globe; however, factors such as stringent expertise, long diagnostic times, invasive and painful screening, and high costs have restricted the use of RT-PCR methods for rapid diagnostics. Therefore, the development of cost-effective, portable, sensitive, prompt, and selective sensing systems to detect SARS-CoV-2 in biofluids at fM/pM/nM concentrations would be a breakthrough in diagnostics. Immunosensors that show increased specificity and sensitivity are considerably fast, and don't imply costly reagents or instruments, reducing the cost for COVID-19 detection. The current developments in immunosensors perhaps signify the most significant opportunity for a rapid assay to detect COVID-19, without the need of highly skilled professionals and specialized tools to interpret results. Artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) can also be equipped with this immunosensing approach to investigate useful networking through database management, sharing, and analytics to prevent and manage COVID-19. Herein, we represent the collective concepts of biomarkers based immunosensors along with AI and IoMT as smart sensing strategies with bioinformatics approach to monitor non-invasive early stage SARS-CoV-2 development, with fast POC diagnostics as the crucial goal. This approach should be implemented quickly and verified practicality for clinical samples before being set in the present times for mass-diagnostic research.","Yadav, Amit K; Verma, Damini; Kumar, Anil; Kumar, Pramod; Solanki, Pratima R",Mater Today Chem,87,16

This paper presents a method for generating educational video recommendation using deep face-features of lecturers without identifying them. More precisely, we use an unsupervised face clustering mechanism to create relations among the videos based on the lecturer's presence. Then, for a selected educational video taken as a reference, we recommend the ones where the presence of the same lecturers is detected. Moreover, we rank these recommended videos based on the amount of time the referenced lecturers were present. For this task, we achieved a mAP value of 99.165%.","Mendes, Paulo R.

We conducted a thorough review of the scientific literature on neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, the neuroinvasive propensity of known coronaviruses (CoV) and their possible effects on brain structural and functional integrity. It appears that around one third of COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) for respiratory difficulties exhibit neurologic symptoms. This may be due to progressive brain damage and dysfunction triggered by severe hypoxia and hypoxemia, heightened inflammation and SARS-CoV-2 dissemination into brain parenchyma, as suggested by current reports and analyses of previous CoV outbreaks. Viral invasion of the brain may particularly target and alter brainstem and thalamic functions and, consequently, result in sensorimotor dysfunctions and psychiatric disorders. Moreover, data collected from other structurally homologous CoV suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to brain cell degeneration and demyelination similar to multiple sclerosis (MS). Hence, current evidence warrants further evaluation and long-term follow-up of possible neurologic sequelae in COVID-19 patients. It may be particularly relevant to evaluate brainstem integrity in recovered patients, as it is suspected that this cerebral area may particularly be dysfunctional following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because CoV infection can potentially lead to chronic neuroinflammation and progressive demyelination, neuroimaging features and signs of MS may also be evaluated in the long term in recovered COVID-19 patients.","Ogier, Michael; Andéol, Guillaume; Sagui, Emmanuel; Bo, Gregory Dal",Brain Behav Immun Health,87,24

In this study, we have achieved intracellular production of PbS QDs using Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. The characterization of these PbS QDS was performed by different techniques, such as Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and particle size analysis (DLS). The obtained results confirmed the synthesis of PbS QDs. The PbS QDs showed absorption peaks at 1088 nm (ultraviolet-visible spectrometry) and a luminescence peak at 1572 nm. In addition, the intracellular biosynthesized PbS QDs showed a particle size in the range 3.47-11.45 nm, which is consistent with DLS and sphere-shaped nanocrystals with good crystallinity and a cubic cristalline structure including pure Pb and S elements. Biosynthesized PbS QDs showed antibacterial activity against Proteus mirabilis ATCC 25933 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 from Gram (-) bacteria and Bacillus cereus NRLL B-3008 and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240 from Gram (+) bacteria.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, distribution of which may indicate the risk of different human organs vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Previous studies investigating the distribution of ACE2 mRNA in human tissues only involved a limited size of the samples and a lack of determination for ACE2 protein. Given the heterogeneity among humans, the datasets covering more tissues with a larger size of samples should be analyzed. Indeed, ACE2 is a membrane and secreted protein, while the expression of ACE2 in blood and common blood cells remains unknown. Herein, the proteomic data in HIPED and the antibody-based immunochemistry result in HPA were collected to analyze the distribution of ACE2 protein in human tissues. The bulk RNA-seq profiles from three separate public datasets including HPA tissue Atlas, GTEx, and FANTOM5 CAGE were also obtained to determine the expression of ACE2 in human tissues. Moreover, the abundance of ACE2 in human blood and blood cells was determined by analyzing the data in the PeptideAtlas and the HPA Blood Atlas. We found that the mRNA expression cannot reflect the abundance of ACE2 factor due to the strong differences between mRNA and protein quantities of ACE2 within and across tissues. Our results suggested that ACE2 protein is mainly expressed in the small intestine, kidney, gallbladder, and testis, while the abundance of which in brain-associated tissues and blood common cells is low. HIPED revealed enrichment of ACE2 protein in the placenta and ovary despite a low mRNA level. Further, human secretome shows that the average concentration of ACE2 protein in the plasma of males is higher than those in females. Our research will be beneficial for understanding the transmission routes and sex-based differences in susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Wang, Yiliang; Wang, Yun; Luo, Weisheng; Huang, Lianzhou; Xiao, Ji; Li, Feng; Qin, Shurong; Song, Xiaowei; Wu, Yanting; Zeng, Qiongzhen; Jin, Fujun; Wang, Yifei",Int J Med Sci,87,4

Our hospital center identified its first COVID-19 confirmed case on March 9, 2020, in a 6-day hospitalized patient. The first confirmed COVID-19 case in a HCW happened 3 days later, in a nurse with a probable epidemiological link related to the first confirmed patient. Our study's first objective is to describe and characterize the impact of the first 3 months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the Centro Hospitalar Universitário Lisboa Norte (CHULN). Our second objective is to report the performance of the CHULN Occupational Health Department (OHD) and the impact of the pandemic on CHULN HCW and its adaptation across national, regional, and institutional epidemiological evolution. Over the first 3 months, 2,152 HCW were screened (which represent 29.8% of the total HCW population), grouped in 100 separate identifiable clusters, each one ranging from 2 to 98 HCW. The most prevalent profession screened were nurses (n = 800;37.2%) followed by doctors (n = 634;29.5%). The main source of potential infection and cluster generating screening procedures was co-worker related (n = 1,216;56.5%). A patient source or a combined patient co-worker source was only accountable for 559 (26%) and 43 (2%) of cases, respectively. Our preliminary results demonstrate a lower infection rate among HCW than the ones commonly found in the literature. The main source of infection seemed to be co-worker related rather than patient related. New preventive strategies would have to be implemented in order to control SARS-CoV-2 spread.","Mendonça-Galaio, L.; Sacadura-Leite, E.; Raposo, J.; França, D.; Correia, A.; Lobo, R.; Soares, J.; Almeida, C.; Shapovalova, O.; Serranheira, F.; Sousa-Uva, A.",Portuguese Journal of Public Health,87,2

The absence of these data has led to the prohibition of exposure of infected corpses during burial procedures. Our aim was to assess the virus's persistence and the possibility of transmission in the post-mortem phase including autopsy staff. The sample group included 29 patients who were admitted to our Covid-19 Centre who died during hospitalisation and the autopsy staff. All the swabs were subjected to a one-step real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with cycle threshold (Ct) values. Swab collection was performed at 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 12 h, over 24 since death. The following were the analysis of patients' swabs: 10 cases were positive 2 h after death; 10 cases positive 4 h after death; 9 cases were found positive 6 h after death; 7 cases positive 12 h after death; 9 cases remained positive 24 h after death. The swabs performed on all the forensic pathologist staff on duty who performed the autopsies were negative. The choice to avoid rituals and the display of corpses before and at the burial procedures given appears cautiously valid due to the persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the post-mortem period. Although the caution in choosing whether or not to perform an autopsy on infected corpses is acceptable, not to perform autopsies is not biologically supported.","Aquila, Isabella; Ricci, Pietrantonio; Bonetta, Carlo Filippo; Sacco, Matteo Antonio; Longhini, Federico; Torti, Carlo; Mazzitelli, Maria; Garofalo, Eugenio; Bruni, Andrea; Trecarichi, Enrico Maria; Serapide, Francesca; Gratteri, Santo; Quirino, Angela; Barreca, Giorgio Settimo; Abenavoli, Ludovico; Arena, Vincenzo; Oliva, Antonio; Giancotti, Aida; Iavicoli, Ivo; Liberto, Maria Carla; Matera, Giovanni",Med Leg J,87,16

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has overwhelmed health care institutions; as a consequence, nurses' lives and psycho-physical health have been affected. INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic forced nurses to work in physically and psychologically stressful conditions impacting on their life. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study. All narratives (texts and videos) posted by nurses from the 23rd of February 2020 to the 3rd of May (from the start of the outbreak to the end of the first lockdown) were analysed and published on the five most popular Italian professional social media platforms. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative research guidelines were followed. RESULTS: Five themes emerged from the 380 narratives explored: 'Sharing what is happening within myself'; 'Experiencing unprecedented working conditions'; 'Experiencing a deep change'; 'Failing to rehabilitate the image of nurses in society'; and 'Do not abandon us'. Even though nurses appreciated the recognition of their communities, they still felt devalued and not recognized as professionals. DISCUSSION: Several psychological, physical, social and professional implications emerged from nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite being highly praised, nurses perceived they had failed in rehabilitating the image of nurses in society. CONCLUSION: The experience of working during the COVID-19 pandemic represented a traumatic event for nurses but it offered them personal and professional growth opportunities.

We studied the use of whole-lung low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) in this patient cohort. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients admitted to the intensive care unit and requiring mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 pneumonia were included in this randomized double-blind study. Patients were randomized to 1 Gy whole-lung LDRT or sham irradiation (sham-RT). Treatment group allocation was concealed from patients and intensive care unit clinicians, who treated patients according to the current standard of care. Patients were followed for the primary endpoint of ventilator-free days at day 15 postintervention. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, as well as changes in oxygenation and inflammatory markers. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were randomized to either whole-lung LDRT or sham-RT between November and December 2020. Patients were generally elderly and comorbid, with a median age of 75 years in both arms. No difference in 15-day ventilator-free days was observed between groups (P = 1.00), with a median of 0 days (range, 0-9) in the LDRT arm and 0 days (range, 0-13) in the sham-RT arm. Overall survival at 28 days was identical at 63.6% (95% confidence interval, 40.7%-99.5%) in both arms (P = .69). Apart from a more pronounced reduction in lymphocyte counts after LDRT (P < .01), analyses of secondary endpoints revealed no significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Whole-lung LDRT failed to improve clinical outcomes in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 pneumonia.","Papachristofilou, Alexandros; Finazzi, Tobias; Blum, Andrea; Zehnder, Tatjana; Zellweger, Núria; Lustenberger, Jens; Bauer, Tristan; Dott, Christian; Avcu, Yasar; Kohler, Götz; Zimmermann, Frank; Pargger, Hans; Siegemund, Martin",Int. j. radiat. oncol. biol. phys,87,16

The three-dimensional (3D) ligand generation in the 3D pocket of protein target is an interesting and challenging issue for drug design by deep learning. Here, the MolAICal software is introduced to supply a way for generating 3D drugs in the 3D pocket of protein targets by combining with merits of deep learning model and classical algorithm. The MolAICal software mainly contains two modules for 3D drug design. In the first module of MolAICal, it employs the genetic algorithm, deep learning model trained by FDA-approved drug fragments and Vinardo score fitting on the basis of PDBbind database for drug design. In the second module, it uses deep learning generative model trained by drug-like molecules of ZINC database and molecular docking invoked by Autodock Vina automatically. Besides, the Lipinski's rule of five, Pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS), synthetic accessibility (SA) and other user-defined rules are introduced for filtering out unwanted ligands in MolAICal. To show the drug design modules of MolAICal, the membrane protein glucagon receptor and non-membrane protein SARS-CoV-2 main protease are chosen as the investigative drug targets. The results show MolAICal can generate the various and novel ligands with good binding scores and appropriate XLOGP values. We believe that MolAICal can use the advantages of deep learning model and classical programming for designing 3D drugs in protein pocket.

In times of the corona pandemic surgery and rehabilitation appointments were cancelled or delayed leading to a more difficult access to auditory rehabilitation. Newly implemented hygiene modalities due to the SARS-CoV­2 pandemic have changed medical aftercare and the rehabilitation process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of rehabilitation under corona conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An anonymous survey of adult cochlear implant patients was carried out by a non-standardized questionnaire. Demographics were analyzed and the quality of medical aftercare, speech therapy, technical aftercare, psychological support and the hygiene modalities were compared to previous rehabilitation stays. RESULTS: In total 109 patients completed the questionnaire. The quality of rehabilitation and individual therapy were rated as qualitatively similar or improved. The threat of the pandemic and fear of corona were rated unexpectedly high with 68% and 50%, respectively. The hygiene measures during the rehabilitation stay eased subjective fears at the same time. The majority of patients were annoyed by wearing face masks but visors, protection shields and social distancing were more tolerated. CONCLUSION: The implementation of the new hygiene modalities within the therapeutic rehabilitation setting was well-accepted by patients allowing access to auditory rehabilitation. A successful rehabilitation should ensure a fear-free environment by adhering to the necessary hygiene modalities.","Aschendorff, A; Arndt, S; Kröger, S; Wesarg, T; Ketterer, M C; Kirchem, P; Pixner, S; Hassepaß, F; Beck, R",HNO,87,17

However, the prevalence of retesting positive by RT-PCR for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the associated patient characteristics, remain unclear. Methods: We included 90 confirmed cases of COVID-19 treated in the Nanjing Public Health Center from January 20, 2020 to February 16, 2020 in this retrospective study. All patients completed treatment for COVID-19 and were retested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 4-20 days after completion of therapy. The clinical characteristics between patients with who retested positive versus negative by RT-PCR were compared, and the factors predictive of positive retesting were analyzed. Positive retesting was modeled with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: The age range of the study population was 0.8-97 years, and all patients were cured or showed improvement. A total of 10 (11%) patients retested positive by RT-PCR 4-20 days after completion of therapy. As compared with patients who retested negative, those who retested positive had a lower percentage of pre-admission fever, a higher percentage of post-admission fever, a lower percentage of bilateral lung infection, higher white blood cell (WBC) count and creatine phosphokinase, and lower hypersensitive c-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 and erythrocyte sedimentation rates (all P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis of the above eight key variables showed that lower hs-CRP and higher WBC were independently associated with positive retesting by RT-PCR. A combination of hs-CRP and WBC were predictive of positive retesting, with an AUC of 0.859. Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 who retested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 had mild symptoms and better blood testing results. A combination of hs-CRP and WBC may predict positive retesting by RT-PCR; however, the sensitivity and specificity should be studied further.","Liu, Yuan; Ding, Ning; Zhou, Shixiang; Chen, Chen; Huang, Shan; Lv, Yanling; Jiao, Damin; Zheng, Yishan; Hu, Zhiliang; Xu, Chuanjun; Chen, Wei; Dai, Hui; Sun, Wenkui; Cheng, Cong; Lv, Ru; Cheng, Jian; Ye, Zi; Li, Zhengjie; Yi, Yongxiang; Wei, Hongxia",J Thorac Dis,87,16

A great number of publications about older adults focus on function or self-care, so we aimed to analyse how cancer and its treatments affect leisure and productivity. Secondary objectives were to identify whether particular clinical and/or sociodemographic factors were associated with occupational disruptions and to assess the impact of rehabilitation approaches on leisure and productivity in this population. Methods: A systematic review of the 2009-2019 literature performed on Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Results: 1471 publications were retrieved: 48 full texts were assessed; seven of these (four cross-sectional studies, two cohort studies, and a case report) were reviewed, including data on 16668 people (12649 healthy controls, 3918 cancer survivors, and 101 ill patients). Older adults with comorbidities and a low level of activity before cancer diagnosis may be more at risk of occupational disruptions. However, studies focused more on physical activity than leisure and productivity. Two studies mentioned occupational therapy. Discussion. As cancer can become a chronic disease, it appears important to also offer occupation-centred assessments and follow-up.

SARS CoV-1 and 2 share almost 80% of genetic sequences and use the same host cell receptor to initiate viral infection. However, SARS predominantly affected individuals in close contact with infected animals and health care workers. In contrast, CoV-2 exhibits robust person to person spread, most likely by means of asymptomatic carriers, which has resulted in greater spread of disease, overall morbidity and mortality, despite its lesser virulence.

No published treatment to date has been shown to adequately control the inflammation and respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, apart from oxygen therapy and assisted ventilation. We evaluated the effects of using high dose oral and/or IV glutathione in the treatment of 2 patients with dyspnea secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: Two patients living in New York City (NYC) with a history of Lyme and tick-borne co-infections experienced a cough and dyspnea and demonstrated radiological findings consistent with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). A trial of 2â¯g of PO or IV glutathione was used in both patients and improved their dyspnea within 1â¯h of use. Repeated use of both 2000 mg of PO and IV glutathione was effective in further relieving respiratory symptoms. Conclusion: Oral and IV glutathione, glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine) and alpha lipoic acid may represent a novel treatment approach for blocking NFKappaB and addressing ""cytokine storm syndrome"" and respiratory distress in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Horowitz, Richard I; Freeman, Phyllis R; Bruzzese, James",Respir Med Case Rep,87,1

Most cases presented with mild respiratory symptoms and required only supportive care with instructions to self-quarantine at home. Others had more severe symptoms that became complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and required hospitalization. CASE REPORT In this report, we present the case of a young patient in New York City who presented to our hospital with coronavirus disease 2019-induced diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) that progressed to ARDS and subsequent death. The patient was managed for DKA on presentation with insulin protocol and acidosis management. However, it became evident that he had underlying respiratory complications, which later presented as ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS We recommend that clinicians be aware of this potentially fatal complication in all patients with pre-existing diabetes. Simultaneously, a low threshold for intubation should be advocated for patients with concurrent COVID-19 and type I diabetes mellitus since the potential for poor clinical outcomes from respiratory demise may be lessened by early respiratory intervention.","Singh, Sukhdev; Foster, Allison; Khan, Zohaib; Siddiqui, Aisha; Atere, Muhammed; Nfonoyim, Jay M",Am J Case Rep,87,16

To date, COVID-19 cases have been reported in 54 out of 55 African countries. However, due to limited severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) testing capacity and scarcity of testing reagents, it is probable that the total number of cases could far exceed published statistics. In this viewpoint, using Ghana, Malawi, South Africa, and Zimbabwe as examples of countries that have implemented different testing strategies, we argue that the implementation of sample pooling for rRT-PCR over antibody rapid diagnostic testing could have a greater impact in assessing disease burden. Sample pooling offers huge advantages compared to single test rRT-PCR, as it reduces diagnostic costs, personnel time, burnout, and analytical run times. Africa is already strained in terms of testing resources for COVID-19; hence, cheaper alternative ways need to be implemented to conserve resources, maximize mass testing, and reduce transmission in the wider population.","Nyazika, Tinashe K; Kaela, Rabelani; Mugoni, Mathias; Musomekwa, Kudakwashe; Kyei-Baafour, Eric; Chiwanda, Simbarashe; Mapondera, Prichard T; Makawa, Tatenda S; Sithole, Elliot M; Mavunganidze, George; Manasa, Justen; Jambo, Kondwani C; Musarurwa, Cuthbert",MSphere,87,16

Also, by considering the dynamic correlation of dynamic correlations between CSPI with gold and CSPI with exchange rates. The data was collected from secondary data in the form of JCI daily data, gold prices, and exchange rate during the COVID-19 pandemic period from January 2020 to June 2020. Further, the data was analyzed by using a GARCH method to examine the effect of changes in gold and USD prices for CSPI and stock volatility. Hence, DCC-GARCH method was used to see the dynamic correlation between CSPI with gold and IHSG with exchange rate. The result showed that changes of gold prices has significant effect of on stock price volatility, the presence of a positive dynamic correlation between CSPI and gold, and a negative dynamic correlation between CSPI and exchange rates. This research can be used as a reference for investors for their investments by looking at the relationship between the CSPI, gold, and the exchange rate.

The aim of this review was to provide a new assessment of the data already available for COVID-19, exploring it as a transient molecular disease that causes negative regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and, consequently, deregulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, promoting important changes in the microcirculatory environment. Another goal of the article was to show how these microcirculatory changes may be responsible for the wide variety of injury mechanisms observed in different organs in this disease. This new proposed concept of COVID-19 provides a unifying pathophysiological picture of this infection and offers fresh insights for a rational treatment strategy to combat this ongoing pandemic.","Ramos, Simone Gusmão; Amanda da Cruz Rattis, Bruna; Ottaviani, Giulia; Nunes Celes, Mara Rubia; Dias, Eliane Pedra",Am. j. pathol,87,16

In December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and rapidly spread worldwide. While diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure are the main features of COVID-19, other organs may be involved, and the incidence of AKI is not well described. We assessed the incidence and clinical characteristics of AKI in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and its effects on clinical outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, observational study of patients with COVID-19 admitted to two general hospitals in Wuhan from 5 January 2020 to 21 March 2020. Demographic data and information on organ dysfunction were collected daily. AKI was defined according to the KDIGO clinical practice guidelines. Early and late AKI were defined as AKI occurring within 72 h after admission or after 72 h, respectively. RESULTS: Of the 116 patients, AKI developed in 21 (18.1%) patients. Among them, early and late AKI were found in 13 (11.2%) and 8 (6.9%) patients, respectively. Compared with patients without AKI, patients with AKI had more severe organ dysfunction, as indicated by a higher level of disease severity status, higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score on admission, an increased prevalence of shock, and a higher level of respiratory support. Patients with AKI had a higher SOFA score on admission (4.5 ± 2.1 vs. 2.8 ± 1.4, OR 1.498, 95% CI 1.047-2.143 ) and greater hospital mortality (57.1% vs. 12.6%, OR 3.998, 95% CI 1.088-14.613) than patients without AKI in both the univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients with late AKI, but not those with early AKI, had a significantly prolonged length of stay (19.6 vs. 9.6 days, p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: Our findings show that admission SOFA score was an independent risk factor for AKI in COVID-19 patients, and patients with AKI had higher in-hospital mortality. Moreover, AKI development after 72 h of admission was related to prolonged hospitalization time.","Cui, Xiaoyang; Yu, Xin; Wu, Xiaojing; Huang, Linna; Tian, Ye; Huang, Xu; Zhang, Zeyu; Cheng, Zhenshun; Guo, Qiang; Zhang, Yi; Cai, Ying; Zhan, Qingyuan",Kidney Blood Press Res,87,1

However, the relationships between OPN expression and chronic shunt-dependent hydrocephalus (SDHC) have never been investigated. In 166 SAH patients (derivation and validation cohorts, 110 and 56, respectively), plasma OPN levels were serially measured at days1-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12 after aneurysmal obliteration. The OPN levels and clinical factors were compared between patients with and without subsequent development of chronic SDHC. Plasma OPN levels in the SDHC patients increased from days 1-3 to days 4-6 and remained high thereafter, while those in the non-SDHC patients peaked at days 4-6 and then decreased over time. Plasma OPN levels had no correlation with serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a systemic inflammatory marker. Univariate analyses showed that age, modified Fisher grade, acute hydrocephalus, cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and OPN and CRP levels at days 10-12 were significantly different between patients with and without SDHC. Multivariate analyses revealed that higher plasma OPN levels at days 10-12 were an independent factor associated with the development of SDHC, in addition to a more frequent use of cerebrospinal fluid drainage and higher modified Fisher grade at admission. Plasma OPN levels at days 10-12 maintained similar discrimination power in the validation cohort and had good calibration on the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Prolonged higher expression of OPN may contribute to the development of post-SAH SDHC, possibly by excessive repairing effects promoting fibrosis in the subarachnoid space.","Asada, Reona; Nakatsuka, Yoshinari; Kanamaru, Hideki; Kawakita, Fumihiro; Fujimoto, Masashi; Miura, Yoichi; Shiba, Masato; Yasuda, Ryuta; Toma, Naoki; Suzuki, Hidenori",Transl. stroke res.

It is believed that fluid dynamic and thermodynamic behavior differ significantly at these scales from the bulk. From a materials perspective, it is important to be able to create complex structures at the nanometer scale, reproducibly, so that the fluid behavior may be studied. New advances in nanoscale-resolution 3D-printing offer opportunities to achieve this goal. In particular, additive manufacturing with two-photon polymerization allows creation of intricate structures. Using this technology, a creation of the first nano-3D-printed digital (shale) rock is reported. In this paper, focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) nano-tomography image dataset was used to reconstruct a high-resolution digital rock 3D model of a Marcellus Shale rock sample. Porosity of this 3D model has been characterized and its connected/effective pore system has been extracted and nano-3D-printed.

COVID-19 shows some inherent risk factors like cardiovascular comorbidities independent from age, gender, and geographic location. One of the most peculiar features of the COVID-19 pandemic is that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 respiratory infections disproportionately impact patients with hypertension, diabetes, and other cardiovascular comorbidities rather than those with allergic respiratory diseases and immune-compromised conditions. Migraine is a complex neuro-vasculo-inflammatory disorder that is also packed frequently with certain medical conditions including vascular disorders, hypertension, allergic diseases such as asthma and systemic inflammatory disorders. Accordingly, 2 different questions arise during the pandemic: (1) Do share comorbidities of cardiovascular diseases and hypertension increase the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 for migraine patients? (2) Do comorbid allergic and atopic diseases, including asthma act as opposite influencers alongside with female gender? This paper focuses on the co-existence of comorbidities of COVID-19, in comparison with migraine, based on a wide clinical dataset and available reports. Discussed mechanisms include potential strategic roles of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, angiotensin-II, and nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome, playing remarkable parts in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and migraine. There are also some clues about the importance of endothelial and pericyte dysfunction and neuroinflammation in COVID-19 infection, related to complications and survival of the patients. The large epidemiological studies as well as basic research, focusing on migraine patients with COVID-19 will clarify these vital questions during the upcoming periods.","Bolay, Hayrunnisa; Özge, Aynur; Uludüz, Derya; Baykan, Betül",Headache,87,3

Most cases of COVID-19 associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) have been reported in children with little data in adults. Here we present a case of MIS in a 19-year-old African American adult. Case Presentation: The patient is a previously healthy 19-year-old African American female who presented with 5 days of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, chills, headache, and malaise. She was diagnosed with COVID- 19 24 days before presentation and remained asymptomatic since testing positive. On presentation, the patient's vitals were significant for a fever of 102.2 F, blood pressure of 97/56, and heart rate of 123. Laboratory workup showed elevated creatinine, and inflammatory markers including procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, Creactive protein, and, D-dimer. A multidisciplinary approach comprising of critical care, cardiology, rheumatology, and infectious disease was undertaken. The initial hospital course was complicated by hypotension requiring pressor support, and an episode of supraventricular tachycardia which resolved with adenosine. Additionally, the patient had a brief episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which self resolved. Initial transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% with left wall hypokinesis. The patient was successfully treated with 1 dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and Solu-Medrol 1 g daily for three days. The patient was monitored with serial troponins, B-natriuretic peptide, and inflammatory markers. Acute kidney injury present on admission resolved within two days. A follow-up TTE obtained three days later showed a significant improvement in EF to 45%. The patient's symptoms resolved within three days of treatment. Discussion: MIS should be considered in adults presenting with atypical gastrointestinal, cardiac, and musculoskeletal symptoms with elevated inflammatory markers in the setting of a recent diagnosis of COVID-19. Cardiac manifestations such as arrhythmias and wall motion abnormalities should be expected. Unlike MIS in children who display features of Kawasaki disease, adults often lack these overlapping features. Inflammatory markers including procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and ferritin can be used to monitor treatment response as they trend down with appropriate management. Intravenous steroids and IVIG can be effective in managing this clinical entity by improving cardiac parameters such as EF, although long term prognosis remains to be analyzed. Despite limited data, it is reasonable to postulate that MIS may be caused by Covid-19 associated cytokine storm and severe inflammatory response that entails multisystem dysfunction even in individuals without underlying medical conditions.","Ejaz, K.; Patel, N.; Ramos, J.; Sharma, A.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,87,20

We aimed to study the potential role of lung ultrasound score (LUS) in subjects with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an observational, prospective pilot study, including consecutive subjects admitted to an intermediate care unit due to COVID-19 pneumonia. LUS is a 12-zone examination method for lung parenchyma assessment. LUS was performed with a portable convex transducer, scores from 0 to 36 points. Clinical and demographic data were collected at LUS evaluation. Survival analysis was performed using a composite outcome including ICU admission or death. Subjects were followed for 30 d from LUS assessment. RESULTS: Of 36 subjects included, 69.4% were male, and mean age was 60.19 ± 12.75 y. A cutoff LUS &#8805; 24 points showed 100% sensitivity, 69.2% specificity, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 for predicting worse prognosis. The composite outcome was present in 10 subjects (55.6%) with LUS &#8805; 24 points, but not in the group with lower LUS scores (P < .001). Subjects with LUS &#8805; 24 points had a higher risk of ICU admission or death (hazard ratio 9.97 [95% CI 2.75-36.14], P < .001). Significant correlations were observed between LUS and [Formula: see text], serum D-dimer, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. CONCLUSIONS: LUS &#8805; 24 points can help identify patients with COVID-19 who are likely to require ICU admission or to die during follow-up.

We reviewed survival, contamination, and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via environmental surfaces and shared medical devices as well as environmental disinfection of COVID-19 in healthcare settings. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have been demonstrated to survive for hours to days on environmental surfaces depending on experimental conditions. The healthcare environment is frequently contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in most studies but without evidence of viable virus. Although direct exposure to respiratory droplets is the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2, the contaminated healthcare environment can potentially result in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as described with other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It is important to improve thoroughness of cleaning/disinfection practice in healthcare facilities and select effective disinfectants to decontaminate inanimate surfaces and shared patient care items.","Kanamori, Hajime; Weber, David J; Rutala, William A",Clin. infect. dis,87,1

Many researchers are in search for simple and realistic models to manage preventive resources and implement effective measures against hazardous circumstances. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has revealed the fact about deficiencies in health resource planning of some countries having relatively high case count and death toll. A unique epidemic model incorporating stochastic processes and queuing theory is presented, which was evaluated by computer simulation using pre-processed data obtained from an urban clinic providing family health services. Covid-19 data from a local corona-center was used as the initial model parameters (e.g. R0, infection rate, local population size, number of contacts with infected individuals, and recovery rate). A long-run trend analysis for 1 year was simulated. The results fit well to the current case data of the sample corona center. Effective preventive and reactive resource planning basically depends on accurately designed models, tools, and techniques needed for the prediction of feature threats, risks, and mitigation costs. In order to sufficiently analyze the transmission and recovery dynamics of epidemics it is important to choose concise mathematical models. Hence, a unique stochastic modeling approach tied to queueing theory and computer simulation has been chosen. The methods used here can also serve as a guidance for accurate modeling and classification of stages (or compartments) of epidemics in general.","Kondakci, Suleyman; Kondakci, Dilek Doruk",Sci Prog,87,7

Previous reviews show a high prevalence of mental disorders among health care workers, but these need updating and inclusion of studies written in Chinese. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to provide updated prevalence estimates for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, benefitting from the inclusion of studies published in Chinese. METHODS: Systematic search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science, CINAHL, Google Scholar and the Chinese databases SinoMed, WanfangMed, CNKI and CQVIP, for studies conducted between December 2019 and August 2020 on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies published in both English and Chinese were included. RESULTS: Data on the prevalence of moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD was pooled across 65 studies involving 97,333 health care workers across 21 countries. The pooled prevalence of depression was 21.7% (95% CI, 18.3%-25.2%), of anxiety 22.1% (95% CI, 18.2%-26.3%), and of PTSD 21.5% (95% CI, 10.5%-34.9%). Prevalence estimates are also provided for a mild classification of each disorder. Pooled prevalence estimates of depression and anxiety were highest in studies conducted in the Middle-East (34.6%; 28.9%). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted across covariates, including sampling method and outcome measure. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis has identified a high prevalence of moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate support is urgently needed. The response would benefit from additional research on which interventions are effective at mitigating these risks.","Li, Yufei; Scherer, Nathaniel; Felix, Lambert; Kuper, Hannah",PLoS One,87,1

Some of our participants showed depressive and anxious attitudes even in the absence of real pictures of depression and anxiety. This phenomenon, combined with mechanisms of emulation and conditioning, can trigger a vicious cycle within interpersonal relationships and promote the administration of unnecessary treatments. Various approaches have been proposed to help populations suffering from psychosocial problems induced by the Covid-19 pandemic, but there is an objective difficulty in treating a large population. Methods: To contain and reduce this widespread psychosocial unease, in this study we used two radio electric asymmetric conveyer (REAC) technology neuromodulation treatments, neuro postural optimization (NPO) and neuropsychophysical optimization-cervicobrachial (NPPO-CB), aimed at optimizing an individual's response to the effects of environmental stressors. These treatments are quick and easy to administer; therefore, they can be administered to a large cohort of participants in a short time. To evaluate the effects of the REAC NPO and NPPO-CB treatments, the DASS-21 psychometric test was used because it has already been used to test depression, anxiety, and stress during the Covid-19 pandemic. Results: The results of the study confirm the usefulness of REAC NPO and NPPO-CB treatments in helping participants to have better coping strategies for the environmental pressures and reduce the neuropsychological and behavioral effects induced by the Covid-19 pandemic. Discussion: The results obtained in this study are consistent with previous clinical studies confirming the usefulness of the treatments to face neuropsychological and behavioral effects induced by exposome pressure.","Pinheiro Barcessat, Ana Rita; Nolli Bittencourt, Marina; Duarte Ferreira, Larissa; de Souza Neri, Erick; Coelho Pereira, José Alfredo; Bechelli, Fabio; Rinaldi, Arianna",Psychol Res Behav Manag,87,21

However, little is known about potentially vulnerable groups during the final stage of the lockdown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey study was to assess the mental health burden of different professions in China in order to find vulnerable groups, possible influencing factors, and the successful ways of coping during the last four weeks of the lockdown in Hubei province. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey asked participants about current residence, daily working hours, exposure to COVID-19 at work and media preferences. We used Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scales (DASS-21) for the assessment of mental health. Further assessments included perceived stress (CPSS-14), coping strategies for all participants and specific stressors for health care workers. We followed the reporting guidelines of the STROBE statements for observational studies. RESULTS: The sample (N=687) consisted of 158 doctors, 221 nurses, 24 other medical staff, 43 students, 60 teachers/government staff, 135 economy staff, 26 workers/farmers and 20 others. We found 17.9% cases of increased depression, 30.3% anxiety and 13.7% stress. Other medical staff and students were vulnerable to depression while doctors, nurses and students were vulnerable to anxiety. Other medical staff, students and economy staff were vulnerable to stress. Coping strategies were reduced to three factors: active, mental and emotional. Being female and emotional coping were independently associated with depression, anxiety or stress. Applying active coping strategies showed lower odds for anxiety while mental coping strategies showed lower odds for depression, anxiety and stress. Age, being inside a lockdown area, exposure to COVID-19 at work and having a high workload (8-12h per day) was not associated with any symptoms. WeChat was the preferred way of staying informed in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: By the end of the lockdown a considerable part of the Chinese population showed increased levels of depression and anxiety. Students and other medical staff were the most affected, while economy staff were highly stressed. Doctors and nurses need support regarding potential anxiety disorders. Future work should focus on longitudinal results of the pandemic and develop targeted preventive measures.","Du, Junfeng; Mayer, Gwendolyn; Hummel, Svenja; Oetjen, Neele; Gronewold, Nadine; Zafar, Ali; Schultz, Jobst-Hendrik",J. med. internet res,87,16

OBJECTIVE: In this descriptive analysis, we analyzed the epidemiological evidence for the impact of PHSMs on COVID-19 transmission in the United States and compared these data to those for 10 other countries of varying income levels, population sizes, and geographies. METHODS: We compared PHSM implementation timing and stringency against COVID-19 daily case counts in the United States and against those in Canada, China, Ethiopia, Japan, Kazakhstan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe from January 1 to November 25, 2020. We descriptively analyzed the impact of border closures, contact tracing, household confinement, mandated face masks, quarantine and isolation, school closures, limited gatherings, and states of emergency on COVID-19 case counts. We also compared the relationship between global socioeconomic indicators and national pandemic trajectories across the 11 countries. PHSMs and case count data were derived from various surveillance systems, including the Health Intervention Tracking for COVID-19 database, the World Health Organization PHSM database, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. RESULTS: Implementing a specific package of 4 PHSMs (quarantine and isolation, school closures, household confinement, and the limiting of social gatherings) early and stringently was observed to coincide with lower case counts and transmission durations in Vietnam, Zimbabwe, New Zealand, South Korea, Ethiopia, and Kazakhstan. In contrast, the United States implemented few PHSMs stringently or early and did not use this successful package. Across the 11 countries, national income positively correlated (r=0.624) with cumulative COVID-19 incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that early implementation, consistent execution, adequate duration, and high adherence to PHSMs represent key factors of reducing the spread of COVID-19. Although national income may be related to COVID-19 progression, a country's wealth appears to be less important in controlling the pandemic and more important in taking rapid, centralized, and consistent public health action.","Zweig, Sophia Alison; Zapf, Alexander John; Xu, Hanmeng; Li, Qingfeng; Agarwal, Smisha; Labrique, Alain Bernard; Peters, David H",JMIR Public Health Surveill,87,24

Surveillance surrounding COVID-19 testing, conï¬rmed cases, and deaths has provided essential information to public health professionals about how to minimize morbidity and mortality. In the United States, surveillance has also pointed out how populations, on the basis of geography, age, and race and ethnicity, are being impacted disproportionately, allowing targeted intervention and evaluation. However, COVID-19 surveillance has also highlighted how the public health surveillance system fails some communities, including sexual and gender minorities. This failure has come about because of the haphazard and disorganized way disease reporting data are collected, analyzed, and reported in the United States, and the structural homophobia, transphobia, and biphobia acting within these systems.

Patient surge, a consequence of most types of disasters that contribute to trauma experiences, is a primary factor in disrupting such care as it is composed of worried well persons and those experiencing psychosocial trauma that can severely disrupt and overwhelm effective acute hospital based health care. We review the literature and propose a potential solution framework to reduce such a surge that relies on exploiting community social networks as first responders. We utilize and integrate literature based evidence on patient surge, community disaster behaviors and community based informal social networks to examine reasons for patient surge to hospitals. We then propose that leveraging community based social networks as a potent deterrent for non-critically injured, especially those who have experienced psychosocial trauma or the worried well, from seeking hospital care during ongoing disasters. By emphasizing the social capital inherent in community based social networks, this perspective posits an alternative cost-effective means of reducing patient surge.","Kirschenbaum, Alan",Nat Hazards (Dordr),87,1

Duplicate articles or those unrelated to at least one chronic comorbidity, senescence or inflammation and those that studied only patient clinical characteristics, laboratory tests or treatments were excluded. Finally, our selection included 124 articles for analysis: 10 meta-analyses, 24 original research articles, 67 review articles, 9 editorials, 9 comments, 3 books and 2 websites. DEVELOPMENT: Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are the most common comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. Risk of developing severe manifestations of the disease, including death, is increased in senescent and obese patients and those with cardiovascular disease, cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Low-grade chronic inflammation is characteristic of all these conditions, reflected in a pro-inflammatory state, endothelial dysfunction, and changes to innate immunity; mainly of the monocyte-macrophage system with changes in polarization, inflammation, cytotoxicity and altered antigenic presentation. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, mechanisms involved in acute inflammation overlap with the patient's pro-inflammatory state, causing immune system dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2 infection amplifies already-existing alterations, causing failures in the immune system's control mechanisms. The resulting cytokine storm causes an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response marked by high serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers and a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile with decompensation of underlying diseases. In asthma, chronic eosinophilic inflammation protects against infection by producing a reduced interferon-mediated response and a reduced number of ACE2 receptors. CONCLUSIONS: Low-grade chronic inflammation present in advanced age and chronic diseases-but not in bronchial asthma-produces a pro-inflammatory state that triggers a dysregulated immune response, favoring development of severe forms of COVID-19 and increasing lethality.","Suárez-Reyes, Anamary; Villegas-Valverde, Carlos A",MEDICC Rev,87,33

Whether this deleterious inflammation is primarily a direct reaction to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 or an independent immunopathologic process is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine SARS-CoV-2 organotropism and organ-specific inflammatory responses, and the relationships between viral presence, inflammation, and organ injury. METHODS: Tissue was acquired from eleven detailed post-mortem examinations. SARS-CoV-2 organotropism was mapped by multiplex PCR and sequencing, with cellular resolution achieved by in situ viral spike protein detection. Histological evidence of inflammation was quantified from 37 anatomical sites, and the pulmonary immune response characterized by multiplex immunofluorescence. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Multiple aberrant immune responses in fatal Covid-19 were found, principally involving the lung and reticuloendothelial system, and these were not clearly topologically associated with the virus. Inflammation and organ dysfunction did not map to the tissue and cellular distribution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein, both between and within tissues. An arteritis was identified in the lung, which was further characterised as a monocyte/myeloid-rich vasculitis, and occurred along with an influx of macrophage/monocyte-lineage cells into the pulmonary parenchyma. In addition, stereotyped abnormal reticulo-endothelial responses, including excessive reactive plasmacytosis and iron-laden macrophages, were present and dissociated from viral presence in lymphoid tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue-specific immunopathology occurs in Covid-19, implicating a significant component of immune-mediated, virus-independent immunopathology as a primary mechanism in severe disease. Our data highlight novel immunopathological mechanisms, and validate ongoing and future efforts to therapeutically target aberrant macrophage and plasma cell responses as well as promoting pathogen tolerance in Covid-19.

Method: An online survey of speech therapists in Hong Kong was conducted between February and March in 2020. The survey comprised up to 15 questions to assess participants' demographics, existing service delivery in telepractice, perception, and their training and knowledge on telepractice. Results: One hundred thirty-five speech (n = 135) speech language pathologists responded to the survey. About one-third (34.8%; n = 47) of participants reported having provided services through telepractice, whereas 72.3% of them started in <3 months and half of them considered it was less effective than face-to-face service. Among the other participants (n = 88), 83% of them indicated that unsuitable patient type and age as the main reason for not providing telepractice. The majority of participants had no prior training for delivering telepractice, and focused on technology when asked about their desired training. Knowledge of participants on telepractice was found only to align fairly with international guidelines. Discussions: The survey findings suggested that telepractice provision in Hong Kong was different from that of other countries where telepractice has been well established, due to the accelerated emergence by the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The study showed how the development of telepractice would be like in a short time frame, and findings on perception and desired training could be a reference for a better establishment of this model of service.","Fong, Raymond; Tsai, Chun Fung; Yiu, Oi Yan",Telemed. j. e. health,87,20

The positivity resonance theory of co-experienced positive affect (Fredrickson, 2016) holds that shared pleasant states that include the key features of mutual care and a sense of oneness through behavioral synchrony function to build prosocial tendencies (e.g., self-transcendent and other-oriented dispositions of felt unity, empathy, altruism, and general positivity toward humanity). We tested the theory-driven hypothesis that prosocial tendencies are associated with high-quality social connections characterized by the affective state of positivity resonance and, in turn, account for behaviors to slow the spread of COVID-19. We measured perceived positivity resonance at the level of social episodes either during the COVID-19 pandemic (study 1, N = 1059, April-May 2020) or before it (study 2, N = 227, March-November 2019). In both studies, cross-sectionally and prospectively, results suggest that perceived positivity resonance had a positive indirect effect on self-reported hygienic behaviors (e.g., handwashing and mask wearing), which was mediated by a latent measure of prosocial tendencies. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these mediation effects to be independent of competing predictors of prosocial tendencies (e.g., overall positive and negative affect, frequency of social interaction) and competing predictors of health behaviors (e.g., political orientation, high-risk status, illness symptoms). Effects for social distancing were mixed. Overall, findings are consistent with the view that positivity resonance builds self-transcendent prosocial tendencies that motivate behaviors to protect community health.

Today, five years after the AACN's deadline, nursing has not yet adopted a universal DNP standard for APRN practice entry. PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to examine the factors influencing the ability of nursing schools to implement a universal DNP standard for APRNs. METHODS: Deans from top-ranked nursing schools explore the current state of the DNP degree in the US. The authors draw upon their collective experience as national leaders in academic nursing, long-time influencers on this debate, and heads of DNP programs themselves. This insight is combined with a synthesis of the literature and analysis of previously unpublished data from the AACN on trends in nursing doctoral education. FINDINGS: This paper highlights issues such as the long history of inconsistency (in messaging, curricula, etc.) surrounding the DNP, certification and accreditation challenges, cost barriers, and more. The authors apply COVID-19 as a case study to help place DNP graduates within a real-world context for health system stakeholders whose buy-in is essential for the success of this professional transition. DISCUSSION: This paper describes the DNP's standing in today's professional environment and advances the conversation on key barriers to its adoption. Insights are shared regarding critical next steps to ensure national acceptance of the DNP as nursing's terminal practice degree.","McCauley, Linda A; Broome, Marion E; Frazier, Lorraine; Hayes, Rose; Kurth, Ann; Musil, Carol M; Norman, Linda D; Rideout, Kathy H; Villarruel, Antonia M",Nurs Outlook,87,16

Two authors independently searched three clinical trial registries and included interventional clinical trials on COVID-19 hospitalized patients that required at least one elevated inflammatory biomarker. Relevant data, including the type and cutoff of the measured biomarker, oxygen/respiratory criteria, fever, radiologic criteria, and medications, were summarized. A total of 47 clinical trials were included. The included studies considered the following criteria: oxygen/respiratory criteria in 42 trials (89%), radiologic criteria in 29 trials (62%), and fever in 6 trials (18%). Serum ferritin was measured in 35 trials (74%), CRP in 34 trials (72%), D-dimer in 26 trials (55%), LDH in 24 trials (51%), lymphocyte count in 14 trials (30%), and IL-6 in 8 trials (17%). The cutoff values were variable for the included biomarkers. The most commonly used medications were tocilizumab, in 15 trials (32%), and anakinra in 10 trials (24.4%). This systematic review found high variability in CRS definitions and associated biomarker cutoff values in COVID-19 clinical trials. We call for a standardized definition of CRS, especially in COVID-19 patients.","Eljaaly, Khalid Malibary Husam Alsulami Shaimaa Albanji Muradi Badawi Mazen Al-Tawfiq Jaffar A.",Pathogens,87,23

The viral and cellular mechanisms regulating the formation of these syncytia are not well understood. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2-infected cells express the Spike protein (S) at their surface and fuse with ACE2-positive neighboring cells. Expression of S without any other viral proteins triggers syncytia formation. Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), a family of restriction factors that block the entry of many viruses, inhibit S-mediated fusion, with IFITM1 being more active than IFITM2 and IFITM3. On the contrary, the TMPRSS2 serine protease, which is known to enhance infectivity of cell-free virions, processes both S and ACE2 and increases syncytia formation by accelerating the fusion process. TMPRSS2 thwarts the antiviral effect of IFITMs. Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 pathological effects are modulated by cellular proteins that either inhibit or facilitate syncytia formation.","Buchrieser, Julian; Dufloo, Jérémy; Hubert, Mathieu; Monel, Blandine; Planas, Delphine; Rajah, Maaran Michael; Planchais, Cyril; Porrot, Françoise; Guivel-Benhassine, Florence; Van der Werf, Sylvie; Casartelli, Nicoletta; Mouquet, Hugo; Bruel, Timothée; Schwartz, Olivier",EMBO J,87,29

To minimize SARS-CoV-2 spread, understanding the mechanisms of infection from all possible routes of entry is essential. While aerosol transmission is thought to be the primary route of spread, viral particles have been detected in ocular fluid, suggesting that the eye may be a vulnerable point of viral entry. To this end, we confirmed SARS-CoV-2 entry factor and antigen expression in post-mortem COVID-19 patient ocular surface tissue and observed productive viral replication in cadaver samples and eye organoid cultures, most notably in limbal regions. Transcriptional analysis of ex vivo infected ocular surface cells and hESC-derived eye cultures revealed robust induction of NF-&#954;B in infected cells as well as diminished type I/III interferon signaling. Together these data suggest that the eye can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2 and implicate limbus as a portal for viral entry.","Eriksen, Anne Z; Møller, Rasmus; Makovoz, Bar; Uhl, Skyler A; tenOever, Benjamin R; Blenkinsop, Timothy A",Cell stem cell (Online),87,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was designed to differentiate the impact of the pandemic on inpatient and outpatient nuclear medicine operations and on public versus private health systems, respectively. Questions were addressing the following issues: impact on nuclear medicine diagnostics and therapy, use of recommendations, personal protective equipment, and organizational adaptations. The survey was available for 6 days and closed on April 20, 2020. RESULTS: 113 complete responses were recorded. Nearly all participants (97â%) report a decline of nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures. The mean reduction in the last three weeks for PET/CT, scintigraphies of bone, myocardium, lung thyroid, sentinel lymph-node are -14.4â%, -47.2â%, -47.5â%, -40.7â%, -58.4â%, and -25.2â% respectively. Furthermore, 76â% of the participants report a reduction in therapies especially for benign thyroid disease (-41.8â%) and radiosynoviorthesis (-53.8â%) while tumor therapies remained mainly stable. 48â% of the participants report a shortage of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Nuclear medicine services are notably reduced 3 weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reached Germany, Austria and Switzerland on a large scale.

Patients and Methods: We identified a retrospective cohort of patients requiring admission at the Mayo Clinic using our enterprise-wide COVID-19 registry from March 1, 2020, through September 30, 2020. Available information included age, sex, use of statins, medical comorbidities, and 30-day mortality. We estimated the association of statins with 30-day mortality using odds ratios and 95% CIs from logistic regression modeling. Results: Patients (N=1295) between the ages of 30 and 80 years tested positive for COVID-19 and required admission during the study period, of whom 500 (38.6%) were taking statins at admission. Patients taking statins were older and more likely to have diabetes mellitus or congestive heart failure. Within 30 days of diagnosis, 59 (4.6%) died. In multivariable analysis, statin users did not have statistically different odds of death within 30 days with an odds ratio of 1.14 (95% CI, 0.64 to 2.03;P=.67) compared to nonusers. Conclusion: Patients with COVID-19 taking statins had similar 30-day mortality to those not taking statins after adjusting for relevant covariates. Although this is partly influenced by a higher prevalence of risk factors for more severe COVID-19 presentation not entirely adjusted for by the Charlson comorbidity index, these data would not support statins as a likely therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 in the hospital setting.","Yetmar, Z.

terapéutica particular A new coronavirus makes its appearance in China in late 2019, causing acute respiratory infection and respiratory failure Due to its clinical and microbiological similarity to the agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), SARS-CoV1, which affected China in 2003, was named SARS-CoV2, and the disease it produces as COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 2019) Since its identification, the medical world has been flooded with statistical reports, tables and figures regarding the epidemiological behavior of SARS-CoV2, but few authors have focused their research on pathogenic mechanisms and if they have, their articles have been diluted by the maelstrom of statistical data The objective of the present work is to delve into the pathophysiological aspects of SARS-CoV2 infection, for which I carried out a literature review from the start of the current pandemic until June 2020, using Mendeley and PubMed for the search, focused above all on the ability of the virus to alter the delicate balance between angiotensin II and its antagonists, to analyze the possible reasons for the worse evolution in a subgroup of patients and to propose therapeutic measures focused on these findings SARS-CoV2 infects cells that express the primary receptor for the virus, the enzyme ACE2, present in the intestinal and respiratory epithelium, as well as the endothelium Initially, it generates hypoxia due to alveolar injury and then generates endothelial dysfunction due to direct injury, antibody-mediated injury, cytokine storm and alteration of the balance between angiotensin II and its functional antagonists, with eventual thrombosis in pulmonary and systemic territory, as well as angiopathic hemolysis and due to macrophage hyperactivity The positive feedback between hypoxia, inflammation and angiotensin II potentiates the development of a distress syndrome and multi-organ failure, with an increase in mortality The analysis of the probable pathophysiology in SARS-CoV2 infection allows us to draw some conclusions, the main ones being that the endothelium is one of the central actors in the pathogenesis of the disease and that the patients with the highest risk of complications are those with previous endothelial dysfunction, due to the presence of obesity, diabetes mellitus or hypertension, as well as that there are different phases or stages, each with a possible particular therapeutic intervention, that is, that COVID-19 is different between patients and in the same patient it is different in time, with each moment requiring a particular therapeutic intervention","Mateos, Edgard Alexis",An.

Cross-sectional data from the early months of the pandemic indicates that approximately one-third of adults in multiple nations are hesitant or resistant to a vaccine for COVID-19. Using longitudinal data, we tracked changes in attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination during the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: This is a quantitative, longitudinal design. METHOD: Nationally representative samples of the adult general population of the Republic of Ireland (N = 1041) and the United Kingdom (N = 2025) were assessed for their attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination at three points from March to August 2020. RESULTS: Statistically significant increases in resistance to COVID-19 vaccination were observed in Irish (from 9.5% to 18.1%) and British (from 6.2% to 10%) adults. CONCLUSION: Resistance to vaccination has significantly increased in two European nations as the pandemic has progressed. Growing resistance to COVID-19 vaccination will pose a challenge to public health officials responsible for ensuring sufficient vaccine coverage.","Hyland, P; Vallières, F; Shevlin, M; Bentall, R P; McKay, R; Hartman, T K; McBride, O; Murphy, J",Public Health,87,24

METHODS: We undertook an observational study of 572 individuals with type 1 diabetes for whom paired flash glucose monitoring data were available between early March and May 2020. The primary outcome was change in flash glucose monitoring variables. We also assessed clinical variables associated with change in glycaemic control. RESULTS: Percentage of time in range increased between March and May 2020 [median (interquartile range) 53 (41-64)% vs 56 (45-68)%; P < 0.001], with associated improvements in standard deviation of glucose (P <0.001) and estimated HbA1c (P <0.001). There was a small reduction in the number of individuals meeting the hypoglycaemia target of <5% per day (64% vs 58%; P = 0.004). Comparing changes in flash glucose monitoring data from March to May in 2019 with the same period in 2020 confirmed that these differences were confined to 2020. Socio-economic deprivation was an independent predictor of a &#8805;5% reduction in time in range during lockdown (odds ratio 0.45 for people in the two most affluent Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles; P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown was not associated with a significant deterioration in glycaemic control in people with type 1 diabetes using flash glucose monitoring. However, socio-economic deprivation appeared to increase the risk of decline in glycaemic control, which has implications for how support is focused in challenging times.","Dover, A R; Ritchie, S A; McKnight, J A; Strachan, M W J; Zammitt, N N; Wake, D J; Forbes, S; Stimson, R H; Gibb, F W",Diabet Med,87,1

However, its impact on fresh fruit and vegetable vendors remains unclear; these are often smaller, more community centered, and may lack the financial infrastructure to withstand supply and demand changes induced by such crises. OBJECTIVE: This study documents the methodology used to assess fresh fruit and vegetable vendor closures in New York City (NYC) following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic by using Google Street View, the new Apple Look Around database, and in-person checks. METHODS: In total, 6 NYC neighborhoods (in Manhattan and Brooklyn) were selected for analysis; these included two socioeconomically advantaged neighborhoods (Upper East Side, Park Slope), two socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods (East Harlem, Brownsville), and two Chinese ethnic neighborhoods (Chinatown, Sunset Park). For each neighborhood, Google Street View was used to virtually walk down each street and identify vendors (stores, storefronts, street vendors, or wholesalers) that were open and active in 2019 (ie, both produce and vendor personnel were present at a location). Past vendor surveillance (when available) was used to guide these virtual walks. Each identified vendor was geotagged as a Google Maps pinpoint that research assistants then physically visited. Using the ""notes"" feature of Google Maps as a data collection tool, notes were made on which of three categories best described each vendor: (1) open, (2) open with a more limited setup (eg, certain sections of the vendor unit that were open and active in 2019 were missing or closed during in-person checks), or (3) closed/absent. RESULTS: Of the 135 open vendors identified in 2019 imagery data, 35% (n=47) were absent/closed and 10% (n=13) were open with more limited setups following the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. When comparing boroughs, 35% (28/80) of vendors in Manhattan were absent/closed, as were 35% (19/55) of vendors in Brooklyn. Although Google Street View was able to provide 2019 street view imagery data for most neighborhoods, Apple Look Around was required for 2019 imagery data for some areas of Park Slope. Past surveillance data helped to identify 3 additional established vendors in Chinatown that had been missed in street view imagery. The Google Maps ""notes"" feature was used by multiple research assistants simultaneously to rapidly collect observational data on mobile devices. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology employed enabled the identification of closures in the fresh fruit and vegetable retail environment and can be used to assess closures in other contexts. The use of past baseline surveillance data to aid vendor identification was valuable for identifying vendors that may have been absent or visually obstructed in the street view imagery data. Data collection using Google Maps likewise has the potential to enhance the efficiency of fieldwork in future studies.","Ali, Shahmir H; Imbruce, Valerie M; Russo, Rienna G; Kaplan, Samuel; Stevenson, Kaye; Mezzacca, Tamar Adjoian; Foster, Victoria; Radee, Ashley; Chong, Stella; Tsui, Felice; Kranick, Julie; Yi, Stella S",JMIR Form Res,87,1

Numerous countries have attempted to employ precautions to address this pandemic. This study was aimed at exploring and assessing the early precautionary actions taken by 175 countries on six continents to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: An observational study utilizing available public data was conducted on the basis of data collected from December 31, 2019 until the end of April 2020 and then compared with data in January 2021. Several data were extracted, including information related to the date of the first reported case of SARS-CoV-2, total confirmed cases, total active cases and more. In addition, seven validated indicators were used to assess the countries' preparedness and precautionary actions. Results: A total of 175 countries were included in the study. The total COVID-19 infection rate increased exponentially and rapidly in North America and Europe from March to April. The application of precautions (indicators) varied between countries. School closures, quarantines and curfews were the most-applied indicators among all countries. As for the relationship between the indicators and their effects on the infection rate, Italy and Spain were the top countries in Europe and adopted all the indicators. Nevertheless, they faced high infection rates: 239,639 and 205,463 COVID-19 cases in Spain and Italy, respectively. Conclusion: The precautionary actions might have played a role in limiting the spread of COVID-19 in several countries. However, many countries might not benefit from applying these indicators.","Alshammari, Thamir M; Alenzi, Khalidah A; Alnofal, Fatemah A; Fradees, Ghada; Altebainawi, Ali F",Saudi pharmaceutical journal,87,1

Obtaining QALY values for COVID-19 presents a challenge owing to the availability of two US EQ-5D-5L value sets and the potentially asymptomatic presentation of the disease. The first value set was completed allowing for the discounting of future health outcomes while the second value set is undiscounted. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the distribution of QALY values using a national survey and the two published value sets; and to estimate the association between COVID-19 outcomes and QALY losses. METHODS: Between 9 and 11 November, 2020, 1153 US adults completed the EQ-5D-5L instrument (five items and a visual analog scale) as well as self-reported their demographics, COVID-19 symptoms, and memberships to populations that are at risk of COVID-19 infection. The two US value sets were applied to the EQ-5D-5L responses to produce QALY values. We estimated the mean QALYs by visual analog scale decile and a generalized linear model of COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: The discounted values are higher than the undiscounted values for each visual analog scale decile owing to methodological differences. Persons at increased risk, with a fever in the past day, and with one or more other symptoms have significantly greater QALY losses (p < 0.01). Overall, non-institutionalized individuals at risk of symptomatic clinical COVID-19 equal 0.68 for the 2016 value set (95% confidence interval 0.49-0.87) and 0.10 for the 2017 value set (95% confidence interval - 0.31 to 0.51) QALYs.

Evidence has shown increased mortality rates associated with COVID-19 infection. However, little is known about the outcomes of COVID-19 negative patients in a pandemic environment. In addition, the impact of vitamin D levels on mortality in COVID-19 hip fracture patients has yet to be determined. METHODS: This multicentre observational study included 1,633 patients who sustained a hip fracture across nine hospital trusts in North West England. Data were collected for three months from March 2020 and for the same period in 2019. Patients were matched by Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (NHFS), hospital, and fracture type. We looked at the mortality outcomes of COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients sustaining a hip fracture. We also looked to see if Vitamin D levels had an impact on mortality. RESULTS: The demographics of the 2019 and 2020 groups were similar, with a slight increase in proportion of male patients in the 2020 group. The 30-day mortality was 35.6% in COVID-19 positive patients and 7.8% in the COVID-19 negative patients. There was a potential association of decreasing vitamin D levels and increasing mortality rates for COVID-19 positive patients although our findings did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: In 2020 there was a significant increase in 30-day mortality rates of patients who were COVID-19 positive but not of patients who were COVID-19 negative.

Virus-containing aerosols may intrude into an uncontaminated area from a confined source space under certain ventilated conditions. The penetration factor, which is the most direct parameter for evaluating the invasion process, can effectively reflect the penetration fraction of aerosols and the shielding efficiency of buildings. Based on the observed concentrations of aerosols combined with a widely used concentration model, four numerical calculations of the penetration factor are proposed in this study. A theoretical time-correction Pest was applied to a size-dependent Pavg by proposing a correction coefficient r, and the error analysis of the real-time P(t) and the derived Pd were also performed. The results indicated that Pavg supplied the most stable values for laboratory penetration simulations. However, the time-correction is of little significance under current experimental conditions. P(t) and Pd are suitable for rough evaluation under certain conditions due to the inevitability of particles detaching and re-entering after capture.

Previously infected individuals were excluded from pivotal clinical trials and the optimum dose regimen in this population has not been clearly studied. The CRO-VAX HCP study aims to investigate the early antibody response in a population of health-care professionals having received two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. METHODS: The CRO-VAX HCP study is a multicentre, prospective, interventional study conducted in several sites in Belgium. The study included 231 health-care professional volunteers who received the two-dose regimen of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Of these, 73 were previously infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 158 were uninfected and seronegative. In the first group, blood samples were collected at baseline and after 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28 days. In the second group, samples were obtained at baseline and after 14 and 28 days. Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of the spike protein were measured in all individuals at different time-points. RESULTS: In uninfected individuals, 95.5% (95% CI 91.0%-98.2%) developed anti-spike antibodies after 14 days and a 24.9-fold rise (95% CI 21.4%-28.9%) in antibody titre was observed after the second dose. In previously infected individuals, peak antibody response was reached after 7 days (i.e. 6347 U/mL) and the second dose did not lead to significantly higher antibody titres (i.e. 8856-11 911 U/mL). Antibody titres were higher in previously infected individuals.

However, most prior studies of China's DNS filtering were performed over short time periods, leading to unnoticed changes in the GFW's behavior. In this study, we introduce GFWatch, a large-scale, longitudinal measurement platform capable of testing hundreds of millions of domains daily, enabling continuous monitoring of the GFW's DNS filtering behavior. We present the results of running GFWatch over a nine-month period, during which we tested an average of 411M domains per day and detected a total of 311K domains censored by GFW's DNS filter. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest number of domains tested and censored domains discovered in the literature. We further reverse engineer regular expressions used by the GFW and find 41K innocuous domains that match these filters, resulting in overblocking of their content. We also observe bogus IPv6 and globally routable IPv4 addresses injected by the GFW, including addresses owned by US companies, such as Facebook, Dropbox, and Twitter. Using data from GFWatch, we studied the impact of GFW blocking on the global DNS system. We found 77K censored domains with DNS resource records polluted in popular public DNS resolvers, such as Google and Cloudflare. Finally, we propose strategies to detect poisoned responses that can (1) sanitize poisoned DNS records from the cache of public DNS resolvers, and (2) assist in the development of circumvention tools to bypass the GFW's DNS censorship.","Hoang, Nguyen Phong; Niaki, Arian Akhavan; Dalek, Jakub; Knockel, Jeffrey; Lin, Pellaeon; Marczak, Bill; Crete-Nishihata, Masashi; Gill, Phillipa; Polychronakis, Michalis",,87,21

Trata-se de estudo transversal aninhado a uma coorte de saúde bucal infantil em que foram coletados dados de crianças nascidas em 2013 e acompanhadas por 2 anos, em Porto Alegre. Foi aplicado um questionário sobre variáveis maternas e frequência de consultas de puericultura, medidas antropométricas e consumo alimentar da criança. Para tal, foi gerado um escore a partir da pontuação criada conforme o SISVAN (Sistema de Vigilância Alimentar e Nutricional). Foi calculado um modelo multivariado, por meio da Regressão de Poisson com variância robusta. A amostra consistiu de 249 crianças. Encontrou-se 30,5% (76) de qualidade ruim/regular da alimentação, que no modelo multivariado esteve associada com nível educacional do responsável, sendo até ensino médio incompleto (RP = 2,14, IC95% = 1,03-4,44) e ensino médio completo (RP = 1,70, IC95% = 0,81-3,54), assim como não ter consultado com dentista (RP = 2,54, IC95% = 1,33-4,84) ou ter consultado até o quarto mês de idade (RP = 1,94, IC95% = 1,01-3,72).

However, there is no Polish version of the AEBQ validated for adolescents, and to the best of our knowledge, no study completed with the Polish version of the AEBQ has been published thus far. The present study aimed to validate the AEBQ in a population-based sample of Polish secondary school students and to assess differences in appetitive traits between boys and girls within the Polish Adolescents' COVID-19 Experience (PLACE-19) Study. The PLACE-19 Study was conducted in a group of 2448 adolescents recruited in May 2020 through the random quota sampling of secondary schools. The AEBQ was used to assess food approach subscales (Food Responsiveness, Emotional Over-Eating, and Enjoyment of Food) and food avoidance subscales (Satiety Responsiveness, Emotional Under-Eating, Food Fussiness, and Slowness in Eating). To validate the questionnaire, the standardized factor loadings within confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with weighted least squares (WLS) were analyzed, and invariance was verified. The CFA presented good model fit, with &#967;2 = 4826.105 (degrees of freedom (df) = 384), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.069 (90% confidence interval (CI): 0.067, 0.070), comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.90, and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = 0.08. The results revealed that, compared to the configural invariance model, the metric invariance model did not result in significantly decreased model fit, with &#916;CFI = -0.002 and &#916;RMSEA = -0.001, which were lower than the recommended cutoffs of 0.010 and 0.015, respectively. The scalar invariance model also did not result in significantly decreased fit of the model over the metric invariance model, with &#916;CFI = -0.005 and &#916;RMSEA = 0.000. Girls reported higher levels of Food Responsiveness (p < 0.0001), Emotional Over-Eating (p < 0.0001), Satiety Responsiveness (p < 0.0001), Emotional Under-Eating (p < 0.0001), and Slowness in Eating than boys (p < 0.0001), and the total AEBQ scores of girls were also higher (p < 0.0001). Positive inter-correlations were observed between all food approach subscales, as well as between Emotional Under-Eating and all food approach subscales for girls, boys, and the total sample; positive inter-correlations were also observed between the majority of food avoidance subscales. The present study confirmed the validity of the AEBQ in the studied population, and supported the associations between appetitive traits assessed using the AEBQ; it also indicated higher scores of both food approach and food avoidance subscales in girls than in boys in a population-based sample of Polish secondary school students.","Guzek, Dominika; Skolmowska, Dominika; Glabska, Dominika",Nutrients,87,1

Our objective was to produce the Periodontal Senior Case Clinical Challenge (PSCCC) that would provide fourth-year students an alternative for senior case presentations and would be a formative assessment for which student opinions would be provided and analysed. The PSCCC would utilise an online, case-based, written, clinical assessment and follow-up, structured discussion to challenge students to demonstrate ability to apply didactic periodontal knowledge to patient-based experiences. We hypothesised the PSCCC would provide effective learning and a formative assessment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Relevant didactic resources were distributed to 48 students for independent review. The PSCCC was delivered in two sections, (1) a case-based assessment via a virtual classroom with written student responses, and (2) oral discussions conducted via virtual meetings that were moderated and assessed by ten periodontists, with the collaboration of nine residents. A voluntary six-statement survey was used to evaluate the students' opinions of the PSCCC. The scores for 75% (36/48) of students who participated were evaluated for statistical and clinical importance. RESULTS: The value of our PSCCC was supported by 91.7% (33/36) of the analyses (p < .0008). DISCUSSION: The PSCCC was a successful alternative pathway to assess students' clinical and didactic integrated knowledge in periodontics. It provided a unified vision of treatment of the selected case, building on all aspects of the students' periodontal education whilst allowing interaction in a simultaneous, three-tiered educational approach, involving dental students, periodontal residents and faculty. CONCLUSION: In support of our hypothesis, for each of the 6 statements, &#8805;94.44% (34/36) of the scores given by the students were considered exceptionally strong clinical support for our pedagogical strategy that combines educational resources and can be successfully implemented in other programmes.","Garcia, M Nathalia; Whitener, Sara J; Ghassemi, Amirezza; Bitter, Robert; Miley, Douglas; Naylor, Jeffrey; Drukteinis, Saulius; Hildebolt, Charles F",Eur. j. dent. educ,87,20

Therefore, grounded on the good governance theory, the current study aimed to empirically examine how good governance practices promote public trust with the underlying mechanism of perceived government response on COVID-19 (PGRC) and moderating role of government agency's provision of quality information on social media (GQS). The data was collected from 491 followers of the Facebook account, Instagram, and Twitter pages of a government news agency, i.e., Associated Press of Pakistan and were analyzed using measurement and structural model by employing SmartPls 3.3.0. The results revealed a direct and indirect association of good governance practices with the public's trust in government via PGRC as mediator. Likewise, results showed that GQS interacts with PGRC and augments public trust in government. This study tried to contribute to the body of knowledge while addressing the gap related to the dearth of literature regarding government use of ICT during the COVID-19 pandemic to harvest benefits from social media while communicating with citizens on a larger scale. Moreover, the current study offers valuable practical and strategical recommendations to agencies and policymakers.","Mansoor, Mahnaz",Government Information Quarterly,87,1

The specific complication is that the size of the subgroup needs to be estimated, whereas the number of individuals that experience the event is known. The problem is motivated by the recent study of Streeck et al. (2020), who estimate the infection fatality rate (IFR) of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a German town that experienced a super-spreading event in mid-February 2020. In their case the subgroup of interest is comprised of all infected individuals, and the event is death caused by the infection.

The city imposed different levels of social distancing including, the closure of sports venues and restrictions on eateries. This inevitably affects the eating behaviour and physical activities of the population. We examined the changes in eating behavior and physical activities before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and identified sociodemographic factors associated with the behavioral changes. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study via a random telephone survey of Chinese adults conducted in Hong Kong from May to June, 2020 - a period in which social distancing measures were being imposed. We measured the physical activity habits from four aspects and dietary consumption patterns from seven aspects before and during the pandemic based on the World Health Organization's guidelines and previous publications. RESULTS: In total, 724 participants were recruited. Individuals were found to cook more frequently at home (p < 0.001) and order take-out (p < 0.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. While no significant change in the frequency of fast food consumption was observed, we found significant increases in the frequency of eating fruits (p < 0.001) and vegetables (p = 0.004). The frequencies of walking, moderate-intensive sports, and high-intensity sports were significantly reduced (p < 0.001). We found that healthy lifestyle behaviors during the pandemic were negatively associated with participants' economic status. CONCLUSIONS: Social distancing measures likely provided an opportunity for individuals to stay home and thus eat healthier. However, in a prolonged period of social restrictions, a lower physical activity level poses a risk to public health. Public health officials are thus advised to monitor physical health on a population-wide basis. The findings highlighted the importance of interventions tailored to individuals who have prolonged home stays - particularly for individuals in the low economic group.","Wang, Jingxuan; Yeoh, Eng Kiong; Yung, Tony Ka Chun; Wong, Martin Chi Sang; Dong, Dong; Chen, Xiao; Chan, Maggie Ka Ying; Wong, Eliza Lai Yi; Wu, Yushan; Guo, Zihao; Wang, Yawen; Zhao, Shi; Chong, Ka Chun",J Int Soc Sports Nutr,87,33

Also, to detect any change it the phonatory patterns while speaking with face mask. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, observational study, conducted by distributing an online questionnaire. From a total of 155 people who participated in the study, 143 of them wore protective face mask during their working hours and qualified. Five groups of questions were used to measure the Speech Difficulties, the Mask Related Behaviors caused by the use of face mask, alterations in the Voice Perceptual Features, the Vocal Tract Discomfort levels and the Greek version of the Voice Handicap Index. The participants self-evaluated their voice and stated the frequency and severity of the symptoms they experienced during the mask usage period. RESULTS: The results showed that the use of protective face mask increases the self-perception of changes in the voice, especially in the voice-breathing coordination and has great effect on the intelligibility and overall communication. The majority of people stated that they have to speak louder and that they have noticed alterations in the perceptual features of their voice, with hoarseness, and volume being the most frequently affected. Almost every symptom on the Vocal Tract Discomfort Group was present with Dry, Lump in Throat, Tight, and Short Breath being the most severe, and Dry and Short breath being the most common among them. Physical, Functional, and Emotional affectations were also observed through the Voice Handicap Index. CONCLUSION: The use of protective face mask increases the vocal effort of the speaker, affects the voice-breathing coordination, limits the overall communication, alters the perceptual features of the voice, increases vocal track discomfort levels and results in psychosocial and socioemotional difficulties. All these affectations may result to the establishment of a voice disorder, especially in high-risk population.","Karagkouni, Olympia",J. voice,87,1

There is limited information regarding postoperative surveillance and survivorship care in the Australian context. This study investigated patterns of colorectal cancer surveillance at a large tertiary institution. METHODS: A retrospective review of hospital records was conducted for all patients treated with curative surgery between January 2012 and June 2017. Provision of clinical surveillance, colonoscopy, computed tomography (CT), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) within 24 months postoperatively were recorded. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to evaluate time-to-surveillance review and associated investigations. RESULTS: A total of 675 patients were included in the study. Median time to first postoperative clinical review was 20 days (95% confidence interval (CI), 18-21) with only 31% of patients having their first postoperative clinic review within 2 weeks. Median time to first CEA was 100 days (95% CI, 92-109), with 47% of patients having their CEA checked within the first 3 months, increasing to 68% at 6 months. Median time to first follow-up CT scan was 262 days (95% CI, 242-278) and for colonoscopy, 560 days (95% CI, 477-625). Poor uptake of surveillance testing was more prevalent in patients from older age groups, those with multiple comorbidities, and higher stage cancers. CONCLUSION: Colorectal cancer surveillance is multi-disciplinary and involves several parallel processes, many of which lead to inconsistent follow-up. Further prospective work is required to identify the reasons for variation in care and which aspects are most important to cancer patients.","Pellegrino, Samantha A; Chan, Steven; Simons, Koen; Kinsella, Rita; Gibbs, Peter; Faragher, Ian G; Deftereos, Irene; Yeung, Justin Mc",Asia Pac. j. clin.oncol,87,20

In the case of COVID-19 pandemic in a developing country such as Bangladesh, however, the fact is that some physicians decline either to report for duty or to treat patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms. At issue ethically is whether such medical practitioners are to be automatically disciplined for dereliction of duty and gross negligence; or, on the contrary, such physicians may legitimately claim a professional right of autonomous judgment, on the basis of which professional right they may justifiably decline to treat patients. METHODS: This ethical issue is examined with a view to providing some guidance and recommendations, insofar as the conditions of medical practice in an under-resourced country such as Bangladesh are vastly different from medical practice in an industrialized nation such as the USA. The concept of moral dilemma as discussed by philosopher Michael Shaw Perry and philosopher Immanuel Kant's views on moral appeal to ""emergency"" are considered pertinent to sorting through the moral conundrum of medical care during pandemic. RESULTS: Our analysis allows for conditional physician discretion in the decision to treat COVID-19 patients, i.e., in the absence of personal protective equipment (PPE) combined with claim of duty to family. Physicians are nonetheless expected to provide a minimum of initial clinical assessment and stabilization of a patient before initiating transfer of a patient to a ""designated"" COVID-19 hospital. The latter is to be done in coordination with the national center control room that can assure admission of a patient to a referral hospital prior to ambulance transport. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a moral dilemma (i.e., conflict of obligations) in the pandemic situation of clinical care requires institutional authorities to exercise tolerance of individual physician moral decision about the duty to care. Hospital or government authority should respond to such decisions without introducing immediate sanction, such as suspension from all clinical duties or termination of licensure, and instead arrange for alternative clinical duties consistent with routine medical care.","Swazo, Norman K; Talukder, Md Munir Hossain; Ahsan, Mohammad Kamrul",Philos Ethics Humanit Med,87,29
357896,357896,357896,Poetry,12.471684,4.44803,2020,"OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 has been compared with other strains of coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and with the flu viruses: all of them manifest themselves with respiratory symptoms and, although their genetic patterns are similar, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection has quickly reached global dimensions, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 is a virus with greater spreading capacity, albeit less lethal. Compared with influenza viruses, coronaviruses have a longer incubation period and the patients with coronaviruses' syndromes develop more severe diseases requiring frequent hospitalizations and intensive care admissions. The aim was to explore the relationships between seasonal influenza vaccination and coronavirus infection and to understand whether this hypothetic role by the flu vaccines modifies SARS-CoV-2 infection's outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective, multicenter study, we enrolled 952 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection; 448 were admitted to our two main hospitals in Ferrara territory, while the remaining 504 were isolated at home. We compared the group of patients who had been vaccinated for influenza in the previous 12 months to that of unvaccinated patients. RESULTS: Significant differences were found for both the need for hospitalization and 30-day mortality between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. We found age to be the only independent risk factor for a worse 30-day prognosis, while gender, influenza vaccinations and age itself were independent risk factors for undergoing hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: In our groups of patients, we found a relationship between seasonal influenza vaccinations and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age seems to be the main risk factor for short-term mortality in COVID-19 inpatients, while the influenza vaccination is, together with gender and age itself, a determining factor in predicting the need for hospitalization.","Greco, S; Bella, A; Bonsi, B; Fabbri, N; Califano, A; Morrone, S; Chessa, P; Pistolesi, C; Zuliani, G; De Motoli, F; Manfredini, R; De Giorgi, A; Passaro, A",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,87,20

RT-qPCR is the gold standard test, and comparison of methodologies and reagents, utilizing patient samples, is important to establish reliable diagnostic pipelines. METHODS: Here, we assessed indirect methods that require RNA extraction with direct RT-qPCR on patient samples. Four different RNA extraction kits (Qiagen, Invitrogen, BGI and Norgen Biotek) were compared. For detection, we assessed two recently developed Taqman-based modules (BGI and Norgen Biotek), a SYBR green-based approach (NEB Luna Universal One-Step Kit) with published and newly-developed primers, and clinical results (Seegene STARMag RNA extraction system and Allplex 2019-nCoV RT-qPCR assay). We also tested and optimized direct, extraction-free detection using these RT-qPCR systems and performed a cost analysis of the different methods evaluated here. RESULTS: Most RNA isolation procedures performed similarly, and while all RT-qPCR modules effectively detected purified viral RNA, the BGI system provided overall superior performance (lower detection limit, lower Ct values and higher sensitivity), generating comparable results to original clinical diagnostic data, and identifying samples ranging from 65 copies to 2.1 × 105 copies of viral genome/µl. However, the BGI detection system is more expensive than other options tested here. With direct RT-qPCR, simply adding an RNase inhibitor greatly improved detection, without the need for any other treatments (e.g. lysis buffers or boiling). The best direct methods detected ~ 10 fold less virus than indirect methods, but this simplified approach reduced sample handling, as well as assay time and cost. CONCLUSIONS: With extracted RNA, the BGI RT-qPCR detection system exhibited superior performance over the Norgen system, matching initial clinical diagnosis with the Seegene Allplex assay. The BGI system was also suitable for direct, extraction-free analysis, providing 78.4% sensitivity.

Respiratory disorders, lymphopenia, cytokine cascades, and the immune responses provoked by this virus play a major and fundamental role in the severity of the symptoms and the immunogenicity which it causes. Owing to the decrease in the inflammatory responses' regulation in the immune system and the sudden increase in the secretion of cytokines, it seems that an investigation of inhibitory immune checkpoints can influence theories regarding this disease's treatment methods. Acquired cell-mediated immune defense's T-cells have a key major contribution in clearing viral infections thus reducing the severity of COVID-19's symptoms. The most important diagnostic feature in individuals with COVID-19 is lymphocyte depletion, most importantly, T-cells. Due to the induction of interferon-Î³ (INF-Î³) production by neutrophils and monocytes, which are abundantly present in the peripheral blood of the individuals with COVID-19, the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints including, PD-1 (programmed death), PD-L1 and CTLA4 on the T-cells' surface is enhanced. The purpose of this review is to discuss the functions of these checkpoints and their effects on the dysfunction and exhaustion of T-cells, making them almost ineffective in individuals with COVID-19, especially in the cases with extreme symptoms.","Aghbash, Parisa Shiri; Eslami, Narges; Shamekh, Ali; Entezari-Maleki, Taher; Baghi, Hossein Bannazadeh",Life Sci,87,6

We hypothesized that in the absence of formal guidelines, the decision to close a state reflects the classic Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics - the amount by which a stimulus (such as number of cases or deaths) must increase in order to be noticed as a fraction of the intensity of that stimulus. METHODS: On 12 April 2020, we downloaded data from the New York Times database from all 50 states and the District of Columbia; by that time all but 7 states had issued the stay-at-home orders. We fitted the Weber-Fechner logarithmic function by regressing the log2 of cases and deaths, respectively, against the daily counts. We also conducted Cox regression analysis to determine if the probability of issuing the stay-at-home order increases proportionally as the number of cases or deaths increases. RESULTS: We found that the decision to issue the state-at-home order reflects the Weber-Fechner law. Both the number of infections (P = <.0001; R2 = .79) and deaths (P < .0001; R2 = .63) were significantly associated with the decision to issue the stay-at-home orders. The results indicate that for each doubling of infections or deaths, an additional four to six states will issue stay-at-home orders. Cox regression showed that when the number of deaths reached 256 and the number of infected people were over 16 000 the probability of issuing ""stay-at-home"" order was close to 100%. We found no difference in decision-making according to the political affiliation; the results remain unchanged on 16 July 2 020. CONCLUSIONS: when there are not clearly articulated rules to follow, decision-makers resort to simple heuristics, in this case one consistent with the Weber-Fechner law.","Djulbegovic, Benjamin; Weiss, David J; Hozo, Iztok",J Eval Clin Pract,87,16

It should therefore have been no surprise that the infection caused by COVID-19 spread so quickly from the metropolitan city of Wuhan, China, to the whole world. Today, the COVID-19 pandemic represents the biggest health crisis for many countries since the postwar period. The aggressiveness of the virus quickly led many countries to bring in strict containment measures to limit the spread of the disease and particularly to reduce pressure on hospitals. Pandemics affect the health care community in different ways, but all involve a bigger flow of patients into the system, compromising the proper functioning of hospitals. Italy was the first Western country to be heavily affected by the virus. This article describes how Italian health care organizations are facing the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey administered to health management experts highlights the main problems and possible ways for health care organizations to cope with the health crisis more effectively. Results highlight that the COVID-19 pandemic had a dramatic impact on health care organizations, forcing all hospitals to modify structures and processes to guarantee an efficacious response to new patient care needs. The lack of specialized resources, appropriate coordination tools, and clear plans for emergency management were the main problems faced by hospitals.

In this study, the prevalence of virulence genes F5, F17, F41, sta, stx1, stx2, eae, and saa in E. coli isolated from pre-weaned calves presenting with (n= 329) or without diarrhea (n= 360) was explored using multiplex polymerase chain reaction. We also evaluated the association between detection of E. coli and the presence of diarrhea. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was detected in 56.3% (388/689) of the fecal samples and showed the highest prevalence (66.5%) in 21-40-day-old calves and the lowest (46.3%) among those that were 1-20 days old. The prevalence of the enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) pathotypes was detected in 73.9% and 15.9%, respectively. The results showed no association between diarrhea and the presence of E. coli in general, ETEC or STEC. The F17 gene was the most frequently detected virulence factor in E. coli of calves of all ages regardless of diarrhea. Interestingly, the results show that the calves aged 41-60 days with F17-positive E. coli are at a higher risk for production of Shiga toxin (Stx1; 95% confidence intervals: 1.86-31.95; P = 0.005) compared to calves aged 1-20 days; no association between this finding and diarrhea was observed among the calves of this age group. Moreover, the virulence genes associated with the ETEC and STEC strains were not significantly associated with pathogenicity in this study cohort. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that while the incidence of E. coli is age-related, there was no relationship linking E. coli virulence genes to calf age and diarrhea. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that detection of E. coli strains either with or without virulence factors was not associated with diarrhea in pre-weaned calves.","Ryu, Ji-Hyoung; Kim, SuHee; Park, Jinho; Choi, Kyoung-Seong",Acta Vet Scand,87,0

Methods： Chinese materia medica and monomers acting on angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor was retrieved by TCMSP database. UniProt, GeneCards and other databases were used to query the gene names corresponding to the target of Chinese medicine monomer, and then Cytoscape 3.6.1 was used to construct the compound-target (gene) network. DAVID was used to carry out the gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis to predict its mechanism of action. Results： There were 54 targets in the puerarin-target network, including AKT1, VEGFA, TNF, etc. GO function enrichment analysis revealed 554 GO items (P &lt; 0.05), including 486 biological process (BP) items, 26 cell component (CC) items, and 42 molecular function (MF) items.

There is a lack of epidemiological data about these pathogens in Morocco. Hence the aim of this study, which is the determination of their prevalence in some leafy greens and root vegetables sold in Marrakech. Methods: A total of 132 vegetable samples including carrot, coriander, lettuce, parsley and radish were purchased monthly from three different markets in Marrakech from March 2017 to January 2018, pre-treated and subjected to microscopic and molecular analyses. Results: Of the 132 samples of vegetables analyzed by qPCR, the overall rate of protozoan was 21.21% (28/132); 22 samples were found to be contaminated with T. gondii, 6 with G. duodenalis, and none was positive for C. parvum/hominis.

However the time needed to delineate the prostate from MRI data accurately is a time consuming process. Deep learning has been identified as a potential new technology for the delivery of precision radiotherapy in prostate cancer, where accurate prostate segmentation helps in cancer detection and therapy. However, the trained models can be limited in their application to clinical setting due to different acquisition protocols, limited publicly available datasets, where the size of the datasets are relatively small. Therefore, to explore the field of prostate segmentation and to discover a generalisable solution, we review the state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms in MR prostate segmentation; provide insights to the field by discussing their limitations and strengths; and propose an optimised 2D U-Net for MR prostate segmentation. We evaluate the performance on four publicly available datasets using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) as performance metric. Our experiments include within dataset evaluation and cross-dataset evaluation. The best result is achieved by composite evaluation (DSC of 0.9427 on Decathlon test set) and the poorest result is achieved by cross-dataset evaluation (DSC of 0.5892, Prostate X training set, Promise 12 testing set). We outline the challenges and provide recommendations for future work. Our research provides a new perspective to MR prostate segmentation and more importantly, we provide standardised experiment settings for researchers to evaluate their algorithms.

METHODS: We included in this study patients with OSAS, who were divided into three groups according to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (group 1, mild [n = 20]; group 2, moderate [n = 20]; and group 3, severe [n = 20]), and healthy controls (group 4, n = 20). Pupillary responses were measured using a pupillometry system. RESULTS: Static (mesopic PD, P = 0.0019; low photopic PD, P = 0.001) and dynamic pupil responses (resting diameter, P = 0.004; amplitude of pupil contraction, P < 0.001; duration of pupil contraction, P = 0.022; velocity of pupil contraction, P = 0.001; and velocity of pupil dilation, P = 0.012) were affected in patients with different OSAS severities. Also, AHI was negatively correlated with mesopic PD (P = 0.008), low photopic PD (P = 0.003), resting diameter (P = 0.001), amplitude of pupil contraction (P < 0.001), duration of pupil contraction (P = 0.011), velocity of pupil contraction (P < 0.001), and velocity of pupil dilation (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: We detected pupil responses innervated by the ANS were affected in the OSAS patients. This effect was more significant in the severe OSAS patients. Therefore, the pupillometry system can be an easily applicable, noninvasive method to detect ANS dysfunction in the OSA patients.","Erdem, Seyfettin; Yilmaz, Sureyya; Karahan, Mine; Dursun, Mehmet Emin; Ava, Sedat; Alakus, Mehmet Fuat; Keklikci, Ugur",Int. ophthalmol,87,24

The absence of P. medius genome sequence presents an important obstacle for further studies of virus–host interactions and better understanding of mechanisms of zoonotic viral emergence. Generation of the high-quality genome sequence is often linked to a considerable effort associated to elevated costs. Although secondary scaffolding methods have reduced sequencing expenses, they imply the development of new tools for the integration of different data sources to achieve more reliable sequencing results. We initially sequenced the P. medius genome using the combination of Illumina paired-end and Nanopore sequencing, with a depth of 57.4x and 6.1x, respectively. Then, we introduced the novel scaff2link software to integrate multiple sources of information for secondary scaffolding, allowing to remove the association with discordant information among two sources. Different quality metrics were next produced to validate the benefits from secondary scaffolding. The P. medius genome, assembled by this method, has a length of 1,985 Mb and consists of 33,613 contigs and 16,113 scaffolds with an NG50 of 19 Mb. At least 22.5% of the assembled sequences is covered by interspersed repeats already described in other species and 19,823 coding genes are annotated. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the clustering of P. medius genome with two other Pteropus bat species, P. alecto and P. vampyrus, for which genome sequences are currently available. SARS-CoV entry receptor ACE2 sequence of P. medius was 82.7% identical with ACE2 of Rhinolophus sinicus bats, thought to be the natural host of SARS-CoV. Altogether, our results confirm that a lower depth of sequencing is enough to obtain a valuable genome sequence, using secondary scaffolding approaches and demonstrate the benefits of the scaff2link application. The genome sequence is now available to the scientific community to (i) proceed with further genomic analysis of P. medius, (ii) to characterize the underlying mechanism allowing Nipah virus maintenance and perpetuation in its bat host, and (iii) to monitor their evolutionary pathways toward a better understanding of bats’ ability to control viral infections.","Fouret, Julien; Brunet, Frédéric G.; Binet, Martin; Aurine, Noémie; Enchéry, Francois; Croze, Séverine; Guinier, Marie; Goumaidi, Abdelghafar; Preininger, Doris; Volff, Jean-Nicolas; Bailly-Bechet, Marc; Lachuer, Joël; Horvat, Branka; Legras-Lachuer, Catherine",Front.

The use of full, standard preparation and draping with standard personal protective equipment (PPE) may not be necessary during this procedure. This is of particular interest in the current climate as we face unprecedented PPE shortages due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of 1,270 patients treated with CRPP of a supracondylar humeral fracture at 2 metropolitan pediatric centers by 10 fellowship-trained pediatric orthopaedic surgeons. One surgeon in the group did not wear a mask when performing CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures, and multiple surgeons in the group utilized a semisterile preparation technique (no sterile gown or drapes). Infectious outcomes were compared between 2 groups: full sterile preparation and semisterile preparation. We additionally analyzed a subgroup of patients who had semisterile preparation without surgeon mask use. Hospital cost data were used to estimate annual cost savings with the adoption of the semisterile technique. RESULTS: In this study, 1,270 patients who underwent CRPP of a supracondylar humeral fracture and met inclusion criteria were identified. There were 3 deep infections (0.24%). These infections all occurred in the group using full sterile preparation and surgical masks. No clinically relevant pin-track infections were noted. There were no known surgeon occupational exposures to bodily fluid. It is estimated that national adoption of this technique in the United States could save between 18,612 and 22,162 gowns and masks with costs savings of $3.7 million to $4.4 million annually. CONCLUSIONS: We currently face critical shortages of PPE due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from this large series suggest that a semisterile technique during CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures is a safe practice. We anticipate that this could preserve approximately 20,000 gowns and masks in the United States over the next year. Physicians are encouraged to reevaluate their daily practice to identify safe opportunities for resource preservation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III.

To identify R. solanacearum effectors that suppress effector-triggered immunity (ETI) in plants, we evaluated R. solanacearum RS1000 effectors for their ability to suppress a hypersensitive response (HR) induced by the avirulence (Avr) effector RipAA in Nicotiana benthamiana. Out of the 11 effectors tested, four suppressed RipAA-triggered HR cell death. Among them, RipAC contains tandem repeats of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif, which serves as the structural scaffold for a protein-protein interaction. We found that the LRR domain of RipAC was indispensable for the suppression of HR cell death during the recognition of RipAA and another Avr effector RipP1. By yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified N. benthamiana SGT1, an adaptor protein that forms a molecular chaperone complex with RAR1, as a host factor of the RipAC target. RipAC interacted with NbSGT1 in yeast and plant cells. Upon the formation of the molecular chaperone complex, the presence of RipAC markedly inhibits the interaction between NbSGT1 and NbRAR1. The RipAA- and RipP1-triggered HR cell death were not observed in NbSGT1-silenced plants. The introduction of RipAC was complementary to the reduced growth of the R. solanacearum mutant strain in N. benthamiana. These findings indicate that R. solanacearum uses RipAC to subvert the NbSGT1-mediated formation of the molecular chaperone complex and suppress ETI responses during the recognition of Avr effectors.","Nakano, Masahito; Ichinose, Yuki; Mukaihara, Takafumi",Plant cell physiol,87,0

The purpose of this study is to share the experience of a distant online lecture on a surgical procedure and related anatomy in a three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality (VR) workspace and to compare it with reported teaching methods, that is, an in-person class and a Zoom online class. The lecture was delivered by three authors of this article in a VR workspace that enables people to meet through VR. The lectures were about combinations of dental surgical procedures and related clinical anatomy. Physically, the attendees could have been located anywhere in the world, so lecturers joined from the United States and the attendees were all from Japan. VR environment and its flexibility enabled attendees to join the lecture actively, helping them to gain understanding of the surgical procedure and anatomy more efficiently. The use of VR technology with a live communication tool demonstrated in this study has several advantages over previous education methods, although there are still technical issues or disadvantages that need to be addressed. Development of the technology and app/software is required so that more data can be processed at higher speed. Use of VR technology with a live communication tool could be an alternative teaching method. Its overall advantages are a closer look at the slides/monitor and concurrent observation of the multiple assets in various directions by multiple attendees. These advantages cannot be achieved by any other teaching method without VR assets with the workspace provided by Spatial. Even during the mandatory social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this could enable us to foster 3D understanding of surgery and related anatomy.

The purpose of this study is to share the experience of a distant online lecture on a surgical procedure and related anatomy in a three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality (VR) workspace and to compare it with reported teaching methods, that is, an in-person class and a Zoom online class. The lecture was delivered by three authors of this article in a VR workspace that enables people to meet through VR. The lectures were about combinations of dental surgical procedures and related clinical anatomy. Physically, the attendees could have been located anywhere in the world, so lecturers joined from the United States and the attendees were all from Japan. VR environment and its flexibility enabled attendees to join the lecture actively, helping them to gain understanding of the surgical procedure and anatomy more efficiently. The use of VR technology with a live communication tool demonstrated in this study has several advantages over previous education methods, although there are still technical issues or disadvantages that need to be addressed. Development of the technology and app/software is required so that more data can be processed at higher speed. Use of VR technology with a live communication tool could be an alternative teaching method. Its overall advantages are a closer look at the slides/monitor and concurrent observation of the multiple assets in various directions by multiple attendees. These advantages cannot be achieved by any other teaching method without VR assets with the workspace provided by Spatial. Even during the mandatory social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this could enable us to foster 3D understanding of surgery and related anatomy. Further study is now needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this newly proposed teaching method by comparing it with traditional in-person and online classes with a live communication tool.","Iwanaga, Joe; Kamura, Yasuhiko; Nishimura, Yuu; Terada, Satoshi; Kishimoto, Naotaka; Tanaka, Tsuyoshi; Tubbs, R Shane",Clin Anat,87,1

A new disease brings many uncertainties, but trials must start rapidly. COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild disease that improves within days to critical disease that can last weeks and can end in death. While improvement in mortality would provide unquestionable evidence about clinical significance of a treatment, sample sizes for a study evaluating mortality are large and may be impractical. Furthermore, patient states in between""cure""and""death""represent meaningful distinctions. Clinical severity scores have been proposed as an alternative. However, the appropriate summary measure for severity scores has been the subject of debate, particularly in relating to the uncertainty about the time-course of COVID-19. Outcomes measured at fixed time-points may risk missing the time of clinical benefit. An endpoint such as time-to-improvement (or recovery), avoids the timing problem. However, some have argued that power losses will result from reducing the ordinal scale to a binary state of""recovered""vs""not recovered.""Methods: We evaluate statistical power for possible trial endpoints for COVID-19 treatment trials using simulation models and data from two recent COVID-19 treatment trials. Results: Power for fixed-time point methods depends heavily on the time selected for evaluation. Time-to-improvement (or recovery) analyses do not specify a time-point. Time-to-event approaches have reasonable statistical power, even when compared to a fixed time-point method evaluated at the optimal time. Discussion: Time-to-event analyses methods have advantages in the COVID-19 setting, unless the optimal time for evaluating treatment effect is known in advance. Even when the optimal time is known, a time-to-event approach may increase power for interim analyses.","Dodd, Lori E; Follmann, Dean; Wang, Jing; Koenig, Franz; Korn, Lisa L; Schoergenhofer, Christian; Proschan, Michael; Hunsberger, Sally; Bonnett, Tyler; Makowski, Mat; Belhadi, Drifa; Wang, Yeming; Cao, Bin; Mentre, France; Jaki, Thomas",,87,1

In Ethiopia, its prevalence is low, but it results in devastative health problems of the mother and her baby. Even though the Ethiopian government and nongovernmental organizations tried to strengthen the health care system, significant adverse maternal and fetal outcome is still associated with uterine rupture. The aim of this study was to identify determinants of uterine rupture in Jinka and Arba Minch General Hospitals. METHODS: The study was conducted in Jinka and Arba Minch General Hospitals, and the data collection period was 15 to 30 November 2018. A case-control study design was used with simple random sampling of 1:4. Data were collected using data extraction sheets. Variables with p < 0.25 in bivariate logistic regression were entered into multivariable logistic regression. Variables with p < 0.05 in multivariable logistic regression were used to determine significant association between dependent and independent variables. RESULT: Uterine rupture occurred in 112 cases with 448 controls. Women referred from health facilities (adjusted odds ratio = 8.0, 95% confidence interval: 3.5-17.8), multiparous women (adjusted odds ratio = 12.7, 95% confidence interval: 4.2-39.0), duration of labor more than 18 h (adjusted odds ratio = 11.5, 95% confidence interval: 5.5-24.1), malpresentation (adjusted odds ratio = 3.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.0-8.0) and gestational age of â©¾37 weeks (adjusted odds ratio = 5.2, 95% confidence interval: 1.4-19.3) were independent factors associated with uterine rupture. CONCLUSION: Mothers referred from health facilities, multiparous women, duration of labor more than 18 h, gestational age of â©¾37 weeks and malpresentation were significantly associated with uterine rupture. Early referral, encouraging family planning, proper use of partograph, early identification and appropriate intervention for malpresentation are recommended.","Girmay, Goitom; Gultie, Teklemariam; Gebremichael, Gebrekiros; Afework, Bezawit; Temesgen, Gebremariam",Womens Health (Lond),87,16

Neither individual findings nor combinations of findings are specific enough to be able to diagnose COVID-19 with a high degree of certainty. The goal was to identify patients in the emergency department, who are at risk for COVID-19 disease, early by using a score, so that they could be isolated pre-emptively. METHOD: Development and implementation of a symptom-based COVID-19 score based on a multicentric retrospective evaluation in three German emergency departments from 9 March until 30 April 2020 of patients suspected of having COVID-19 and subsequent SARS-CoV­2 PCR testing. RESULTS: The study population included 697 patients and 9.4% of these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. A COVID-19 score of &#8805;5 points was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of illness. The sensitivity of the score was 98.4% with a moderate specificity of 48.3%. DISCUSSION: The score, which is easy to obtain during the initial assessment, supports the assessment of the pretest probability for a COVID-19 infection as part of the risk stratification and can influence the treatment pathway in terms of pre-emptive isolation, PCR testing and other treatment options at an early stage. Due to the nonspecific symptoms of the disease; however, it must be accepted that the goal of high sensitivity results in a relatively low specificity of the score.","Hüfner, A; Kiefl, D; Baacke, M; Zöllner, R; Loza Mencía, E; Schellein, O; Avan, N; Pemmerl, S",Med.

Our model enables a tractable quantitative analysis of the optimal policy for the control of the epidemic dynamics using both lockdown and detection intervention levers. With parametric specification based on literature on COVID-19, we investigate the sensitivities of various quantities on the optimal strategies, taking into account the subtle trade-off between the sanitary and the socio-economic cost of the pandemic, together with the limited capacity level of ICU. We identify the optimal lockdown policy as an intervention structured in 4 successive phases: First a quick and strong lockdown intervention to stop the exponential growth of the contagion; second a short transition phase to reduce the prevalence of the virus; third a long period with full ICU capacity and stable virus prevalence; finally a return to normal social interactions with disappearance of the virus. The optimal scenario hereby avoids the second wave of infection, provided the lockdown is released sufficiently slowly. We also provide optimal intervention measures with increasing ICU capacity, as well as optimization over the effort on detection of infectious and immune individuals. Whenever massive resources are introduced to detect infected individuals, the pressure on social distancing can be released, whereas the impact of detection of immune individuals reveals to be more moderate.","Charpentier, Arthur; Elie, Romuald; Lauriere, Mathieu; Tran, Viet Chi",,87,20

Neither frequency (72.5% vs 71.3%; p = ns) nor median time to mechanical ventilation between people of color (9 d [CI, 6-15 d]) and Whites (10 d [CI, 5-16 d]; p = 0.733) was different. Overall, 188 patients (51.5 %) died in the hospital. The 28-day mortality was lower in people of color (107/236; 45.3%) versus Whites (73/129; 56.6%) (adjusted odds ratio 0.60; p = 0.034), and there was an increased median survival time in people of color (20 d) versus Whites (13.5 d; hazard ratio 0.62; p = 0.002). The inhospital mortality was lower in people of color versus White, but the difference was not statistically significant (113 [47.9%] vs 75 [58.1%], respectively; p = 0.061). Finally, there was no significant difference in days of symptoms prior to admission, frequency of presenting symptoms, or frequency or severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome between the two groups.

It is strongly related to work overload and has been a scarcely studied topic in pediatric urology. During the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities' recommendations have led to big changes in pediatric urology practice worldwide. This study aimed to evaluate the level of burnout in Ibero-American pediatric urologists (IPUs) during this pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted by applying an electronic survey during the COVID-19 pandemic peak to members of the two major associations of pediatric urology in Ibero-America (the Ibero-American Society of Pediatric Urology [SIUP] and the Brazilian School of Pediatric Urology [BSPU]) to evaluate demographic, pre-pandemic, and pandemic data. Burnout levels were assessed using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) questionnaire. RESULTS: A response rate of 40% was obtained (182 out of 455 IPU respondents). Participants were from 14 different countries in Ibero-America and 75.4% were male. Data showed that during the pandemic there was a significant decrease in weekly workload, that is: > 40 h per week (h/w) (91.4%-44.6%, p < 0.001); and >6 h/w (94.9%-45.1%%, p < 0.001) in operating room time (ORT). Personal (Pe-BO), work-related (W-BO), and patient-related (Pa-BO) burnout levels among IPUs were 26.3%, 22.3%, and 7.4%, respectively (Summary table). An important difference by gender was seen, with women suffering more from the syndrome (odds ratio of 2.67 [95% confidence interval, 1.285.58; p = 0.013] for Pe-BO and OR of 3.26 [95% CI, 1.52-7.01; p = 0.004] for W-BO).

Emergency medical services (EMS) clinicians may limit their use of intranasal naloxone due to concerns of novel coronavirus infection. We sought to determine changes in overdose events and naloxone administration practices by EMS clinicians. METHODS: Between April 29, 2020 and May 15, 2020, we surveyed directors of EMS fellowship programs across the US about how overdose events and naloxone administration practices had changed in their catchment areas since March 2020. RESULTS: Based on 60 respondents across all regions of the country, one fifth of surveyed communities have experienced an increase in opioid overdoses and events during which naloxone was administered, and 40% have experienced a decrease. The findings varied by region of the country. Eighteen percent of respondents have discouraged or prohibited the use of intranasal naloxone with 10% encouraging the use of intramuscular naloxone. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may provide insight into changes in opioid overdose mortality during this time and assist in future disaster planning.","Cone, David C; Bogucki, Sandy; Burns, Kevin; D039,; Onofrio, Gail; Hawk, Kathryn; Joseph, Daniel; Fiellin, David A",J Addict Med,87,29

Unlike the constant parameters, the complexity of identifying time-varying parameters is largely increased. In this paper, a variant of physics-informed neural network is adopted to identify the time-varying parameters of the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased model for the spread of COVID-19 by fitting daily reported cases. The learned parameters are verified by utilizing an ordinary differential equation solver to compute the corresponding solutions of this compartmental model. The effective reproduction number based on these parameters is calculated. Long Short-Term Memory neural network is employed to predict the future weekly time-varying parameters. The numerical simulations demonstrate that PINN combined with LSTM yields accurate and effective results.

On the other hand, researchers in some fields have focused on cognitive biases and their interventions in thinking and information processing. In this article, by bridging between these two issues, i.e., scientific research mistakes and cognitive bias, it will be first shown that scientific research requires scientists' choices in various stages such as subject selection, data treatment, theory determination, and technological design. Then, we show the involvement of choice-supportive bias in scientific inquiry as one of the potential cognitive limitations of science. Finally, three ways are discussed to mitigate the effects of this bias in science: more scores to self-criticism publications, recording of the shortcomings of the research by the researcher before publishing, and emphasizing control processes before researcher choices in scientific inquiry.","Kafaee, Mahdi; Marhamati, Hanie; Gharibzadeh, Shahriar",Account Res,87,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey was sent to women whose ART cycles were postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak between April and May 2020. The study population were 101 participants. The main outcome measure is to determine the levels of fear and anxiety in infertile women by using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T and STAI-S) and Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S). The relationship of the COVID-19 outbreak with the willingness to go ahead with the desire for pregnancy was also assessed. RESULTS: The state-anxiety levels were significantly higher in women above 35 years (45.0 ± 5.2 vs. 42.2 ± 4.5, p = 0.006). Women with diminished ovarian reserve had a higher state-anxiety compared to other causes, but were not found to be significant (44.7 ± 5.2 vs. 42.5 ± 5.0, p = 0.173). Women who thought that the possibility of not being able to get pregnant was more important than being infected with the COVID-19 had higher anxiety levels than women who thought just the opposite. The diminished ovarian reserve and high duration of infertility were found to be significantly associated with higher anxiety levels (OR = 2.5, p < 0.05). The diminished ovarian reserve and previous ART failure significantly predicted the presence of clinical state-anxiety. CONCLUSION: The state-anxiety was found to be higher in women whose cycles were postponed due to the outbreak and the presence of diminished ovarian reserve also significantly affected anxiety levels. Further research is needed to assess whether COVID-19 will have any impact on ART treatments in the next few years.","Tokgoz, Vehbi Yavuz; Kaya, Yeliz; Tekin, Ahmet Basar",J Psychosom Obstet Gynaecol,87,29

METHODS: Data regarding provisional death counts and estimates of excess deaths for COVID-19 according to state and territory were downloaded from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics website. Reporting included the six-month-long period of March 1 - August 31, 2020. Excess mortality rates were calculated as the number of excess deaths per 100,000 persons in each state population using 2019 US Census Bureau data. Mean values for state and territorial NHSPI domain indices were compared to state and territorial rates of COVID-19-related excess mortality using multiple linear regression, including analysis of variance. Correlations between the 51 state and territorial NHSPI values and corresponding COVID-19 excess mortality rates were calculated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: These calculations revealed a high degree of variance (adjusted r square = 0.02 and 0.25) and poor correlation (P = .16 and .08) among values for the overall NHSPI as compared to low and high estimates of excess COVID-19 mortality rates for 50 US states and Puerto Rico.There was also a high degree of variance (adjusted r square = 0.001 and 0.03) and poor correlation (P values ranging from .09 to .94) for values for the six individual domains of the NHSPI as compared to low and high estimates of excess COVID-19 mortality rates for 50 US states and Puerto Rico. CONCLUSION: The NHSPI does not appear to be a valid predictor of excess COVID-19 mortality rates for 50 US states and Puerto Rico during the first six months of the pandemic.","Keim, Mark E; Lovallo, Alex P",Prehosp Disaster Med,87,16

However, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of this emerging virus. In this manuscript, we collected relevant articles and reviewed the characteristics about SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an online search on PubMed and Web of Science with the keywords COVID-19, 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV-2, and summarized the epidemiology, virology, clinical features and treatments of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: We retrieved 157 published papers about SARS-CoV-2 from January, 2020 to April, 2020. We found that SARS-CoV-2 was a kind of virus with low mortality rate and high infectivity. This virus can enter human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in alveoli and activate immune response in human body. SARS-CoV-2 infection can be classified as asymptomatic, mild, common, severe, and critical. We summarized antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, such as remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir. Because the vaccine of SARS-CoV-2 is developing, more clinical studies are needed to verify the safety and efficacy of these treatments. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that has caused a global pandemic. We should pay more attention to prevent SARS-CoV-2 and try to control it sooner.","Bai, Y-X; Xu, Y-H; Wang, X; Sun, C; Guo, Y; Qiu, S; Ma, K-W",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,87,20

To properly design and operate such a vehicle, it is necessary to know its flight mechanics in the various stages of the flight. Despite the fact that the physic behind the analysis of an aircraft's flight mechanics is well known and purely based on Classical Mechanics, the large quantity of input and output data involved favors the use of a computational toll. This work presents the development of a toolbox called APT (Aircraft Performance Toolbox), able to make preliminary aircraft flight mechanics calculations regarding its performance. To achieve this goal, a number of Matlab scripts were created to perform the calculations, and a graphical interface was created to unify them and to allow the end-user to perform the analysis in a clear and intuitive way. To illustrate the potential of the toolbox, we use APT to in the analysis of an UAV meant to participate in the SAE Brasil AeroDesign competition of the year of 2014.","Pellegrini, C.

Anecdotally, many patients - even those who experience only mild cases initially - continue to suffer from symptoms months after diagnosis, including indicators of potential autonomic dysfunction like tachycardia upon standing. However, the long-term impact of and recovery from COVID-19 on autonomic and cardiovascular function in otherwise healthy individuals remains largely unclear. Methods Otherwise healthy young adults (n=11, 6F) who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 came to the laboratory two times: Visit 1 (V1) was 3-4 weeks post-diagnosis, and Visit 2 (V2) was one month later. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA;n=2) via microneurography, beat by beat systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) arterial blood pressure via finger photoplethysmography, and heart rate (HR) were continuously measured in subjects at rest, during a 2-min cold pressor test (CPT), and during 5 min each at 30° and 60° head up tilt (HUT;no MSNA). Paired sample t-tests and two-way ANOVA were used to determine differences in the cardiovascular outcome measures between visits. Results Resting SBP (123 ± 18 vs. 119 ± 17 mmHg), DBP (73 ± 16 vs. 69 ± 7 mmHg), and HR (63 ± 10 vs. 62 ± 9 bpm) did not change from V1 to V2. Preliminary data (n=2) indicates MSNA may decrease from V1 to V2 (14.5 ± 4 vs. 9 ± 3 bursts·min-1), but the study is currently not powered to examine statistical significance. During the 2-minute CPT protocol, SBP (150 ± 10 vs. 145 ± 13 mmHg, p=0.08), DBP (94 ± 12 vs. 88 ± 12 mmHg, p=0.10), and HR (77 ± 19 vs. 71 ± 11 bpm, p=0.11) tended to be the same or lower from V1 to V2. Likewise, individual data from two subjects suggests MSNA reactivity during a painful stimulus (CPT) may decrease from V1 to V2 (16 ± 4 vs 10 ± 3 bursts·min-1). These two subjects also exhibited reduced MSNA during the three-minute CPT recovery period from V1 to V2 (14 ± 2 vs. 7 ± 1 bursts·min-1). During both 30° and 60° HUT, SBP, DBP, and HR responses were similar between V1 and V2. Conclusion Young, otherwise healthy individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have exaggerated sympathetic neural and cardiovascular responses to physiological stress 3-4 weeks post-positive test date. However, preliminary data indicates that sympathetic and cardiovascular reactivity to painful stimuli is reduced from one- to two-months post-diagnosis. Continued monitoring of autonomic and cardiovascular function is warranted to determine the long-term consequences of contracting SARS-CoV-2.","Stute, Nina Province Valesha Augenreich Marc Stickford Jonathon Ratchford Stephen Stickford Abigail",The FASEB Journal,87,20

Under this policy, the economic burden on dental professionals and their employees was immense. With the prolonged duration of coronavirus health crisis, it was clear that dentists and associated workers and companies cannot bear the cost of longer suspension of regular dental services. At this point, calls have been made for gradual return to regular dental clinical practice. However, dental health professionals around the world realized that oral care services should be tailored to fit the time of COVID-19 pandemic. An important question to be raised here is regarding planning the dental treatment during the time of coronavirus pandemic. Should a dentist plan the dental treatment in a different way to that at a normal time? This paper aims to propose a simple strategy to plan the restorative dental treatment at the time of coronavirus pandemic. The aim of this strategy is to expand the range of oral care services and minimize the risk of infection with this deadly virus.

Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is thought to be a main causative agent, but limited surveillance of EV-D68 in the United States has hampered the ability to assess their causal relationship. Using surveillance data from the BioFire Syndromic Trends epidemiology network in the United States from January 2014 to September 2019, we characterized the epidemiological dynamics of EV-D68 and found latitudinal gradient in the mean timing of EV-D68 cases, which are likely climate driven. We also demonstrated a strong spatiotemporal association of EV-D68 with AFM. Mathematical modeling suggested that the recent dominant biennial cycles of EV-D68 dynamics may not be stable. Nonetheless, we predicted that a major EV-D68 outbreak, and hence an AFM outbreak, would have still been possible in 2020 under normal epidemiological conditions. Nonpharmaceutical intervention efforts due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are likely to have reduced the sizes of EV-D68 and AFM outbreaks in 2020, illustrating the broader epidemiological impact of the pandemic.","Park, Sang Woo; Pons-Salort, Margarita; Messacar, Kevin; Cook, Camille; Meyers, Lindsay; Farrar, Jeremy; Grenfell, Bryan T",Sci. transl. med,87,16

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In our current study, we found that two types of deficient ACE2 isoforms from different mammals compete with full-length ACE2 for association with S protein. One type of ACE2 is a natural soluble isoform, the other type of ACE2 only associates with one loop of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Mammals with either type of ACE2 will be deficient in support of SARS-CoV-2 entry. By combining S recognition and isoform analysis of ACE2, we predict that felids, mustelids, hamsters, and sheep are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, while canids, swines, cattle, and goats are not permissive for SARS-CoV-2. Thus, the differential susceptibilities of mammals with SARS-CoV-2 infection could be partially explained by the ACE2 isoform diversity.

Maximum likelihood (ML) and diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) dominate the estimation of SEMs with continuous or categorical endogenous variables, respectively. When a model is correctly specified, ML and DWLS function well. But, in the face of incorrect structures or nonconvergence, their performance can seriously deteriorate. Model implied instrumental variable, two stage least squares (MIIV-2SLS) estimates and tests individual equations, is more robust to misspecifications, and is noniterative, thus avoiding nonconvergence. This article is an overview and tutorial on MIIV-2SLS. It reviews the six major steps in using MIIV-2SLS: (a) model specification; (b) model identification; (c) latent to observed (L2O) variable transformation; (d) finding MIIVs; (e) using 2SLS; and (f) tests of overidentified equations. Each step is illustrated using a running empirical example from Reisenzein's (1986) randomized experiment on helping behavior. We also explain and illustrate the analytic conditions under which an equation estimated with MIIV-2SLS is robust to structural misspecifications. We include additional sections on MIIV approaches using a covariance matrix and mean vector as data input, conducting multilevel SEM, analyzing categorical endogenous variables, causal inference, and extensions and applications.

We report a case of unilateral multi focal central serous retinopathy, post COVID-19 infection in an Asian Indian female. CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old female presented to us with unilateral blurring, in the right eye (OD), 12 days after COVID-19 infection. She had fever, chills, shortness of breath and cough with tiredness and was COVID- RT PCR positive. She was administered intravenous and oral antibiotics with injection heparin/remdesivir, during her 7 day stay at the hospital. She was also on steroid inhalers. She had no systemic history of note. On ocular evaluation, her corrected distance visual acuity was 20/40 in OD and 20/20 in left eye (OS). Anterior segment was normal. Anterior vitreous was clear. Fundus examination of the OD showed central serous retinopathy (CSCR) with OS being normal. CONCLUSION: CSCR can occur post COVID-19 due to steroid administration and physicians administering it should be aware of this and refer the patients to an ophthalmologist earlier.","Sanjay, S.; Gowda, P.

Its main application in urology is focused on patients undergoing radical cystectomy. OBJECTIVE: Systematic review of the available literature on ERAS protocols applied to patients undergoing radical cystectomy in terms of perioperative outcomes as well in the analysis of their implementation. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A bibliographic search was conducted in the electronic databases PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and Scopus, using the terms «Cystectomy¼, «Enhanced Recovery After Surgery¼ and «Fast-Track¼. Randomized and non-randomized studies that compared the implementation of an ERAS protocol versus a traditional protocol in patients undergoing radical cystectomy were selected. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: 869 articles were identified; 25 were selected for final analysis: 22 non-randomized and 3 randomized studies. No differences were observed in terms of demographic characteristics between studies. Statistically significant differences were identified in favor of the ERAS protocol: length of hospital stay, major complication rate, time to first ambulation and return of bowel function. In the analysis of protocols, a high variability was detected in the number of items and in the implementation method. CONCLUSIONS: The multidisciplinary nature and the number of items of the ERAS protocols imply a high heterogeneity in their implementation. Further randomized studies, standardized reporting and analyzing results, as well as a systematic analysis of subsequent adherence are required to increase comparability between groups.","España-Navarro, R; Rabadán-Márquez, P; Pérez-Argüelles, D; Sánchez-Martínez, N; Hernández-Alcaraz, D; García-Galisteo, E",Actas urol. esp,87,24

Investigating the coping strategies to this unprecedented crisis is essential to guide mental health intervention and public health policy. This study examined how people are coping with the COVID-19 crisis in Ghana and identify factors influencing it. METHODS: This study was part of a multinational online cross-sectional survey on Personal and Family Coping with COVID-19 in the Global South. The study population included adults, &#8805;18 years and residents in Ghana. Respondents were recruited through different platforms, including social media and phone calls. The questionnaire was composed of different psychometrically validated instruments with coping as the outcome variable measured on the ordinal scale with 3 levels, namely, Not well or worse, Neutral, and Well or better. An ordinal logistic regression model using proportional odds assumption was then applied. RESULTS: A total of 811 responses were included in the analysis with 45.2% describing their coping level as well/better, 42.4% as neither worse nor better and 12.4% as worse/not well. Many respondents (46.9%) were between 25-34 years, 50.1% were males while 79.2% lived in urban Ghana. Having pre-existing conditions increased the chances of not coping well (aOR = 1.86, 95%CI: 1.15-3.01). Not being concerned about supporting the family financially (aOR = 1.67, 95%CI: 1.06-2.68) or having the feeling that life is better during the pandemic (aOR = 2.37, 95%CI: 1.26-4.62) increased chances of coping well. Praying (aOR: 0.62, 95%CI: 0.43-0.90) or sleeping (aOR: 0.55, 95%CI: 0.34-0.89) more during the pandemic than before reduces coping. CONCLUSION: In Ghana, during the COVID-19 pandemic, financial security and optimism about the disease increase one's chances of coping well while having pre-existing medical conditions, praying and sleeping more during the pandemic than before reduces one's chances of coping well. These findings should be considered in planning mental health and public health intervention/policy.","Iddi, Samuel; Obiri-Yeboah, Dorcas; Aboh, Irene Korkoi; Quansah, Reginald; Owusu, Samuel Asiedu; Enyan, Nancy Innocentia Ebu; Kodom, Ruby Victoria; Nsabimana, Epaphrodite; Jansen, Stefan; Ekumah, Benard; Boamah, Sheila A; Boateng, Godfred Odei; Doku, David Teye; Armah, Frederick Ato",PLoS One,87,20

E-visits are now reimbursable through Medicare due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The state of evidence regarding e-visits, such as the impact on clinical outcomes and health care delivery, is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To address this gap, we examine how e-visits have impacted clinical outcomes and health care quality, access, utilization, and costs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review; MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched from January 2000 through October 2020 for peer-reviewed studies that assessed e-visits' impacts on clinical and health care delivery outcomes. RESULTS: Out of 1859 papers, 19 met the inclusion criteria. E-visit usage was associated with improved or comparable clinical outcomes, especially for chronic disease management (eg, diabetes care, blood pressure management). The impact on quality of care varied across conditions. Quality of care was equivalent or better for chronic conditions, but variable quality was observed in infection management (eg, appropriate antibiotic prescribing). Similarly, the impact on health care utilization varied across conditions (eg, lower utilization for dermatology but mixed impact in primary care). Health care costs were lower for e-visits than those for in-person visits for a wide range of conditions (eg, dermatology and acute visits). No studies examined the impact of e-visits on health care access. It is difficult to draw firm conclusions about effectiveness or impact on care delivery from the studies that were included because many used observational designs. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the evidence suggests e-visits may provide clinical outcomes that are comparable to those provided by in-person care and reduce health care costs for certain health care conditions. At the same time, there is mixed evidence on health care quality, especially regarding infection management (eg, sinusitis, urinary tract infections, conjunctivitis). Further studies are needed to test implementation strategies that might improve delivery (eg, clinical decision support for antibiotic prescribing) and to assess which conditions can be managed via e-visits.","Nguyen, Oliver T; Alishahi Tabriz, Amir; Huo, Jinhai; Hanna, Karim; Shea, Christopher M; Turner, Kea",J Med Internet Res,87,20

However, these high-performing networks have enormous space and computational complexity due to the millions of parameters and computations involved. These requirements make the deployment of deep learning models to resource-constrained mobile devices challenging. To this end, only a handful of studies based on knowledge distillation and patch-based models have been proposed to obtain compact size CNN models for ocular recognition in the mobile environment. In order to further advance the state-of-the-art, this study for the first time evaluates five neural network pruning methods and compares them with the knowledge distillation method for on-device CNN inference and mobile user verification using ocular images. Subject-independent analysis on VISOB and UPFR-Periocular datasets suggest the efficacy of layerwise magnitude-based pruning at a compression rate of 8 for mobile ocular-based authentication using ResNet50 as the base model. Further, comparison with the knowledge distillation suggests the efficacy of knowledge distillation over pruning methods in terms of verification accuracy and the real-time inference measured as deep feature extraction time on five mobile devices, namely, iPhone 6, iPhone X, iPhone XR, iPad Air 2 and iPad 7th Generation.","Almadan, Ali; Rattani, Ajita",,87,20

Abruptly, many workers have been forced to face the difficulties that come with switching to remote working. Basing on the theoretical framework proposed by the Job Demands-Resources model, the purpose of this paper was to explore the effect of work overload (workload and techno overload), on behavioral stress, meant as an outcome linked to the health impairment process. Furthermore, the aim of the study was to explore the mediating role of job crafting, considered as a second-order construct consisting of two dimensions (increasing structural resources and increasing challenging demands) in the abovementioned relation. Participants were 530 workers experiencing remote working or work-from-home during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Italy (March-May 2020). Hypotheses were explored by using three different latent variables, measured reflexively through indicators on a 5-point scale, extracted from validated questionnaires. Data analysis was performed through Structural Equation Modeling;to test the mediation, bootstrap validation was computed (n = 2,000). Results showed that the mediation of job crafting was partial. More specifically, the direct effect between work overload and behavioral stress was positive;moreover, the indirect, negative effect through the mediation of job crafting was also significant. Therefore, results showed that job crafting can play a crucial role as a protective factor supporting the activation and adjustment of suitable resources;these resources can be useful to deal with the negative effects of work overload, particularly under the condition of heavy remote working and use of technologies, on individual outcomes. Starting from the current global scenario of the pandemic that has not yet ceased its effects, the study suggested decisive theoretical and practical implications. Accordingly, findings extended the current trends in occupational health psychology research, with special reference to the mainstream topic ""work and COVID-19"" in the Italian context. Finally, results can give suggestions to companies engaged in managing change, recommending that they build a collaborative workplace at the individual and collective level to implement job crafting interventions and enrich the personal and organizational resources of workers, which is useful cope with the current demands.","Ingusci, E.; Signore, F.; Giancaspro, M.

Its occurrence is closely related to the intensity of immunosuppressive therapy. In a group of 161 newly transplanted patients, we prospectively evaluated 457 protocol renal biopsies performed within the first year after transplantation. Using the calcineurin inhibitors (CI) nephrotoxicity score, the incidence of nephrotoxicity was monitored as a manifestation of excessive immunosuppression. Findings were correlated with clinical evidence of active BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) replication and PyVAN. Compared to the normal histology, nephrotoxicity was associated with more frequent BKPyV viremia and viruria (p = .01 and p < .01, respectively) and more common occurrence of PyVAN. The persistence of toxicity in the subsequent biopsy proved to be a negative risk factor of viremia and viruria (p = .03 and p < .01, respectively), independently of the initial BKPyV status. Toxicity could also be used as a predictor of viremia and viruria (p = .04 and p < .01, respectively) even in the absence of viral replication at the time of initial biopsy. The early histological manifestation of CI nephrotoxicity was associated with significant BKPyV reactivation in the risky first posttransplant year.","Krejcí, Karel; Tichý, Tomás; Bednaríková, Jana; Bartková, Margita; Zamboch, Kamil; Orság, Jirí; Zadrazil, Josef",J. med. virol,87,27

They range from early, low blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia) without breathlessness (""silent hypoxia""), delirium, rashes, and loss of smell (anosmia), to persisting chest pain, muscle weakness and -pain, fatigue, confusion, memory problems and difficulty to concentrate (""brain fog""), mood changes, and unexpected onset of hypertension or diabetes. SARS CoV-2 affects the microcirculation, causing endothelial cell swelling and damage (endotheliitis), microscopic blood clots (microthrombosis), capillary congestion, and damage to pericytes that are integral to capillary integrity and barrier function, tissue repair (angiogenesis), and scar formation. Similar to other instances of critical illness, COVID-19 is also associated with elevated cytokine levels in the systemic circulation. This review examines how capillary damage and inflammation may contribute to these acute and persisting COVID-19 symptoms by interfering with blood and tissue oxygenation and with brain function. Undetectable by current diagnostic methods, capillary flow disturbances limit oxygen diffusion exchange in lungs and tissue and may therefore cause hypoxemia and tissue hypoxia. The review analyzes the combined effects of COVID-19-related capillary damage, pre-existing microvascular changes, and upstream vascular tone on tissue oxygenation in key organs. It identifies a vicious cycle, as infection- and hypoxia-related inflammation cause capillary function to deteriorate, which in turn accelerates hypoxia-related inflammation and tissue damage. Finally, the review addresses the effects of low oxygen and high cytokine levels in brain tissue on neurotransmitter synthesis and mood. Methods to assess capillary functions in human organs and therapeutic means to protect capillary functions and stimulate capillary bed repair may prove important for the individualized management of COVID-19 patients and targeted rehabilitation strategies.","Østergaard, Leif",Physiol Rep,87,16

Various examples of asymmetric synthesis of optically active alcohols using both enzymes are highlighted. Moreover, the unique thermal stability and organic solvent tolerance of these enzymes is illustrated by their concurrent inclusion with other interesting reactions to synthesize optically active alcohols and amines. For instance, Te SADH has been used in quantitative non-stereoselective oxidation of alcohols to accomplish deracemization of alcohols via cyclic deracemization and in racemization of enantiopure alcohols to accomplish a bienzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution.","Musa, Musa M; Vieille, Claire; Phillips, Robert S",Chembiochem,87,21

Most importantly the health-care workers (HCWs) are under insurmountable psychological pressures which lead them to various mental health problems, such as anxiety, stress, and depression. Objective: This study aimed to assess mental health adverse effects of COVID-19 pandemic on health-care workers in North West Ethiopia 2020. Materials and Methods: Institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted. A simple random sampling technique was applied and 419 participants completed the questionnaire. Mental health adverse effects were measured using the depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21). Data were entered into Epi data version 4.4.2 then exported to SPSS version 24 for analysis. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate binary logistic regressions with odds ratios and 95% confidence interval were employed. The level of significance of association was determined at a p-value &lt; 0.05. Results: Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in this study was 58.2%, 64.7%, and 63.7%, respectively Those who had a medical illness, and mental illness, contact with confirmed COVID-19 pts, and poor social support showed a statistically significant association with depression. Female sex, participants who had families with chronic illness, had contact with confirmed COVID-19 case and poor social support had statistically significant association with anxiety, whereas participants who had families with chronic illness had contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases, and those participants who had poor social support were predictors of stress during COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: The magnitudes of mental health problems were higher and the concerned body should emphasize the continuous assessment of the mental health of health-care workers during this pandemic.","Asnakew, S.; Amha, H.; Kassew, T.",Neuropsychiatric Disease &amp; Treatment,87,5

It was shown during the first wave that mobility restrictions reduce significantly infection transmission. Here we document another relationship and show that, in the period between the first two COVID-19 waves, there exists a high positive correlation between the trends of SARS-Cov-2 transmission and mobility. These two trends oscillate simultaneously and increased mobility following lockdown relaxation has a significant positive relationship with increased transmission. From a public health perspective, these results highlight the importance of following the evolution of mobility when relaxing mitigation measures to anticipate the future evolution of the spread of the SARS-Cov-2.","Cazelles, Bernard; Comiskey, Catherine; Nguyen Van Yen, Benjamin; Champagne, Clara; Roche, Benjamin",Int. j. infect. dis,87,16

Consequently, a burst of scientific reports on epidemiology, symptoms, and diagnosis came out. However, a comprehensive understanding of eco-environmental aspects that may contribute to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread is still missing, and we therefore aim to focus here on these aspects. In addition to human-human direct SARS-CoV-2 transmission, eco-environmental sources, such as air aerosols, different public use objects, hospital wastes, livestock/pet animals, municipal wastes, ventilation facilities, soil and groundwater potentially contribute to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Further, high temperature and humidity were found to limit the spread of COVID-19. Although the COVID-19 pandemic led to decrease air and noise pollution during the period of lockdown, increased use of masks and gloves is threatening the environment by water and soil pollutions. COVID-19 badly impacted all the socio-economic groups in different capacities, where women, slum dwellers, and the people lacking social protections are the most vulnerable. Finally, sustainable strategies, waste management, biodiversity reclaim, eco-friendly lifestyle, improved health infrastructure and public awareness, were proposed to minimize the COVID-19 impact on our society and environment. These strategies will seemingly be equally effective against any future outbreak.","Nazir, Rashid; Ali, Jawad; Rasul, Ijaz; Widemann, Emilie; Shafiq, Sarfraz",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),87,16

Crowd model outputs have been used for evaluating safety and comfort of pedestrians, inform crowd management and perform forensic investigations. Microscopic crowd models allow the representation of each person and the obtainment of information concerning their location over time and interactions with the physical space/other people. Pandemics such as COVID-19 have posed several questions on safe building usage, given the risk of disease transmission among building occupants. Here we show how crowd modelling can be used to assess occupant exposure in confined spaces. The policies adopted concerning building usage and social distancing during a pandemic can vary greatly, and they are mostly based on the macroscopic analysis of the spread of disease rather than a safety assessment performed at a building level. The proposed model allows the investigation of occupant exposure in buildings based on the analysis of microscopic people movement. Risk assessment is performed by retrofitting crowd models with a universal model for exposure assessment which can account for different types of disease transmissions. This work allows policy makers to perform informed decisions concerning building usage during a pandemic.","Ronchi, Enrico; Lovreglio, Ruggiero",Saf. Sci.,87,1

This study used extrusion-based 3D printing to prepare single-layered, tri-layered, and core-in-shell poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) films carrying paclitaxel and rapamycin in combination or lidocaine alone. Each layer was composed of either low molecular weight (MW) PLGA or high MW PLGA. In vitro drug release kinetics of paclitaxel, rapamycin, and lidocaine for PLGA films were assessed and compared with PLGA-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-PLGA hydrogel discs. Regardless of the structure of PLGA film, paclitaxel (half-time: 54-63 days) was released faster than when compared with rapamycin (half-time: 74-80 days). In contrast, single-layered PLGA-PEG-PLGA discs released rapamycin (half-time 5.7 h) at a more rapid rate than paclitaxel (half-time: 7.3 h). Single-layered PLGA-PEG-PLGA discs enabled a faster drug release than PLGA films, noting that the disc matrices dissolve in water in 24 h. Similarly, lidocaine incorporated in PLGA films (half-time: 13-36 days) exhibited slower release patterns than that in PLGA-PEG-PLGA discs (half-time: 2.6 h). In vitro drug release patterns were explained using molecular models that simulate drug-polymer interactions. Analysis of models suggested that drug-polymer interactions, location of each drug in the polymeric matrix, and solubility of drugs in water were major factors that determine drug release behaviors from the polymeric films and discs.","Serris, Ioannis; Serris, Panagiotis; Frey, Kathleen M; Cho, Hyunah",AAPS PharmSciTech,87,4

A dysregulated immune response not only compromises the ability of the host to resolve the viral infection, but may also predispose the individual to secondary bacterial and fungal infections, a risk to which the current therapeutic immunomodulatory approaches significantly contribute. Among the secondary infections that may occur in COVID-19 patients, coronavirus-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is emerging as a potential cause of morbidity and mortality, although many aspects of the disease still remain unresolved. With this opinion, we present the current view of CAPA and discuss how the same mechanisms that underlie the dysregulated immune response in COVID-19 increase susceptibility to Aspergillus infection. Likewise, resorting to endogenous pathways of immunomodulation may not only restore immune homeostasis in COVID-19 patients, but also reduce the risk for aspergillosis. Therefore, CAPA represents the other side of the coin in COVID-19 and our advances in the understanding and treatment of the immune response in COVID-19 should represent the framework for the study of CAPA.","Costantini, Claudio; van de Veerdonk, Frank L; Romani, Luigina",,87,20

Since mutation of ion-channel proteins CACNA1A and GABRD have been associated with epilepsy, it is important to determine the post-traumatic epilepsy-associated changes in expression levels of these ion channel proteins. Additionally, curcumin is already known for its antiepileptic and neuroprotective potential in FeCl3-induced model of post-traumatic epilepsy. Thus, we investigated FeCl3-induced epilepsy mediated differential expression of CACNA1A and GABRD in the cortical region of the rat brain. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of curcumin on the expression of both proteins. For this, epilepsy was induced by intracortical FeCl3 injection (5 µl of 100 mM). Additionally, curcumin (conc. 1000 ppm; 75 mg/kg of b.wt.; for 14 and 28 days) was administered, mixed with normal food pellets. Results obtained from EEG-MUA and Morris water maze assay demonstrate the progression of epilepsy after FeCl3 injection. Additionally, western blotting and histological studies show the downregulation of CACNA1A and GABRD during epileptogenesis. It was observed that epilepsy-associated decline in learning and memory of animals might be linked with the dysregulation of both proteins. Results also demonstrated that curcumin administration ameliorated epilepsy-associated change in expression of both CACNA1A and GABRD proteins. In conclusion, the neuroprotective effect of curcumin against iron-induced epilepsy might be accompanied by the alleviated upregulation of these channel proteins.","Kumar, Prince; Sharma, Deepak",Mol.

METHODS AND RESULTS: All adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection in two Italian provinces were followed for a median of 24 days. ARBs and/or ACEi treatments, and hypertension, diabetes, cancer, COPD, renal and major cardiovascular diseases (CVD) were extracted from clinical charts and electronic health records, up to two years before infection. The sample consisted of 1603 subjects (mean age 58.0y; 47.3% males): 454 (28.3%) had severe symptoms, 192 (12.0%) very severe or lethal disease (154 deaths; mean age 79.3 years; 70.8% hypertensive, 42.2% with CVD). The youngest deceased person aged 44 years. Among hypertensive subjects (n = 543), the proportion of those treated with ARBs or ACEi were 88.4%, 78.7% and 80.6% among patients with mild, severe and very severe/lethal disease, respectively. At multivariate analysis, no association was observed between therapy and disease severity (Adjusted OR for very severe/lethal COVID-19: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.50-1.49). Significant predictors of severe disease were older age (with AORs largely increasing after 70 years of age), male gender (AOR: 1.76; 1.40-2.23), diabetes (AOR: 1.52; 1.05-2.18), CVD (AOR: 1.88; 1.32-2.70) and COPD (AOR: 1.88; 1.11-3.20). Only gender, age and diabetes also predicted very severe/lethal disease. CONCLUSION: No association was found between COVID-19 severity and treatment with ARBs and/or ACEi, supporting the recommendation to continue medication for all patients unless otherwise advised by their physicians.","Bravi, Francesca; Flacco, Maria Elena; Carradori, Tiziano; Volta, Carlo Alberto; Cosenza, Giuseppe; De Togni, Aldo; Acuti Martellucci, Cecilia; Parruti, Giustino; Mantovani, Lorenzo; Manzoli, Lamberto",PLoS One,87,21

Our experiment and simulation show that the output terahertz energy greatly enhances when the input laser pulse is highly chirped, contrary to a common optical rectification process. We find this abnormal behavior is attributed to a linear electro-optic (EO) effect, in which the laser pulse propagating in LiNbO3 is modulated by the terahertz field it produces, and this in turn drives optical rectification more effectively to produce the terahertz field. This resonant cascading effect can greatly increase terahertz conversion efficiencies when the input laser pulse is properly pre-chirped with additional third order dispersion. We also observe similar multicycle terahertz emission from lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) at 14 THz and barium borate (BBO) at 7 THz, 10.6 THz, and 14.6 THz, all produced by narrowband phase-matched optical rectification.","Jang, Dogeun; Kim, Ki-Yong",Opt Express,87,29

There is currently still a lack of research on specific amplification factors regarding anxiety and fear in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite established associations between anxiety sensitivity, intolerance of uncertainty, and cyberchondria, there is currently a lack of empirical data that has investigated the associations between anxiety sensitivity, intolerance of uncertainty, and cyberchondria, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Urgent research is needed to better understand better the role of repeated media consumption concerning COVID-19 in amplifying fear of COVID-19 and COVID-19 anxiety. OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the associations between fear of COVID-19, COVID-19 anxiety, and cyberchondria. METHODS: A convenience sample of 694 respondents (343 males, 351 females) completed an online survey that included the Cyberchondria Severity Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, Anxiety Sensitively Scale, and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale. Multiple mediation analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: The results showed that Fear and anxiety generated by COVID-19 predicted cyberchondria: ß=.39, SE=.04, P<.001, t=11.16, 95% CI [0.31, 0.45] and ß=.25, SE=.03, P<.001, t=7.67, 95% CI [0.19, 0.32], respectively. Also, intolerance of uncertainty and anxiety sensitivity mediated the relationship between fear and anxiety generated by COVID-19 with cyberchondria. In reciprocal model, the standardized total effects of the cyberchondria on fear of COVID19 (ß = .45, SE=.04, P<.001, t= 15.31, 95% CI [0.39, 0.51]) and COVID-19 anxiety (ß = .36, SE=.03, P<.001, t= 11.29, 95% CI [0.30, 0.41]) were statistically significant, with moderate effect sizes. Compared to males, females obtained statistically significantly higher scores of cyberchondria (t[692]=-2.85, P=.004, Cohen's d=.22), COVID-19 anxiety (t(692)=-3.32, P<.01, Cohen's d=.26), and anxiety sensitivity (t[692]=-3.69, P<.001, Cohen's d=.29). CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide further support in better understanding the role of COVID-19 in amplifying cyberchondria. Finally, based on the findings here, cyberchondria must be viewed as a significant public health issue. Importantly, increasing awareness about cyberchondria and online behavior at both individual and collective levels must be prioritized to enhance preparedness and to reduce adverse effects of current and future medical disasters.","Wu, Xue; Nazari, Nabi; Griffiths, Mark D",J. med. internet res,87,24

RESULTS: 105 patients (57 male and 48 female) were confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. Among the 105 patients, 55 (52%) had made short trips to Wuhan during the two weeks before the onset of illness, and these were the first-generation confirmed cases.

Results: The mechanistic method provides an improved fit to data from SARS-CoV-2 infector-infectee pairs compared to commonly used approaches. Our best-fitting model indicates a high proportion of presymptomatic transmissions, with many transmissions occurring shortly before the infector develops symptoms.

We compare estimates of key epidemiological quantities generated using our mechanistic method with analogous estimates generated using previous approaches.Results: The mechanistic method provides an improved fit to data from SARS-CoV-2 infector-infectee pairs compared to commonly used approaches. Our best-fitting model indicates a high proportion of presymptomatic transmissions, with many transmissions occurring shortly before the infector develops symptoms.Conclusions: High infectiousness immediately prior to symptom onset highlights the importance of continued contact tracing until effective vaccines have been distributed widely, even if contacts from a short time window before symptom onset alone are traced.Funding: Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).","Hart, William Stephen; Maini, Philip K; Thompson, Robin N",eLife (Cambridge),87,33

In response, many countries have implemented non pharmaceutical methods of intervention, such as social distancing and lockdowns. This study aims to investigate the relationship of four dimensions of social capital (community attachment, social trust, family bond, and security) and several control variables with COVID-19 deaths. METHODS: We retrieved data from open access databases and a survey. COVID-19 death-related data were collected from the website ""Centre for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University"". Social capital-related data were collected from a large-scale survey that included web-based and face-to-face surveys covering 100,956 respondents across all regions/provinces/states of 37 countries in 2017. Data regarding population density, number of hospital beds, and population aged 65 or older were retrieved from the World Development Indicators (WDIs). Data on country lockdowns were obtained from the website ""National responses to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic"". Linear regressions were applied to identify the relationship between social capital and COVID-19 deaths. RESULTS: We found that COVID-19 deaths were associated with social capital both positively and negatively. Community attachment and social trust were associated with more COVID-19 deaths, and family bond and security were associated with fewer deaths. COVID-19 deaths were positively associated with population density, ageing population, and interactions between four dimensions of social capital-related factors and the ageing population. Furthermore, the number of hospital beds and early lockdown policy were negatively associated with COVID-19 deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the role of social capital in dynamically evolving threats, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, is not always negative or positive. Therefore, people's behaviour should be changed to support countries' response to the COVID-19 threat.","Imbulana Arachchi, Janaki; Managi, Shunsuke",BMC Public Health,87,24

Histopathological analysis reveals that um-PEA reduced alteration in lung after LPS intratracheal administration. Besides, um-PEA decreased wet/dry weight ratio and myeloperoxidase, a marker of neutrophils infiltration, macrophages and total immune cells number and mast cells degranulation in lung. Moreover, um-PEA could also decrease cytokines release of interleukin (IL)-6, interleukin (IL)-1ß, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945; and interleukin (IL)-18. Furthermore, um-PEA significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha (I&#954;B&#945;) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#954;B) activation in ALI, and at the same time decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38/MAPK) expression, that was increased after LPS administration.

METHODS: In total 33 911 babies born to 5 designated hospitals in Nanshan District of Shenzhen city from October 2017 to December 2019 were included. All subjects underwent concurrent hearing and deafness genetic screening covering 21 variants of 4 genes including GJB2, SLC26A4, GJB3 and Mt12SrRNA. For those with positive results, Sanger sequencing was carried out for confirmation. RESULTS: 93.32% subjects passed the first-round hearing screening, and 87.01% passed the recheck testing. The overall detection rate was 4.18%. The detection rates for GJB2, SLC26A4, GJB3 and Mt12srRNA variants were 1.98%, 1.58%, 0.37% and 0.25%, respectively. 126 and 84 subjects were found with high risk for delayed-onset and drug-induced hearing loss, respectively. In addition, 4 and 5 subjects were found to harbor homozygous/compound heterozygous variants of the GJB2 and SLC26A4 genes, respectively. Concurrent screening showed that subjects (with heterozygous variants) who did not passed the two round hearing test were as follows: GJB2 with 6.75% in the first round and 2.61% in the second round testing, SLC26A4 (3.3%/1.2%), GJB3 (0.72%/0.14%) and 12SrRNA (0.36%/Nil), respectively. Moreover, the No-pass rate in the subjects with homozygous or compound variants in single gene, heterozygous variant in single gene, heterozygous variant in multiple genes, and homozygous variant in GJB3 gene were significantly higher than the subjects with negative results of genetic screening. CONCLUSION: Concurrent newborn genetic screening can enhance the effectiveness of hearing screening and enable earlier identification and intervention for children with hearing impairment. Follow-up can improve the diagnostic rate for children who are positive for the concurrent screening. Nevertheless, genetic and hearing screening cannot replace the diagnostic testing. It is necessary to conduct comprehensive analysis for the results of genetic and hearing screening and radiological examinations. Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing are critical for ascertain the diagnosis.","Lei, Jie; Han, Luhao; Deng, Xi; Long, Min; Xiao, Yanwei; Lin, Xiaowen; Zhang, Jing",Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,87,16

Because disease transmission-linked behaviors tend to be interpreted and responded to differently than other antisocial behaviors, it is unclear whether general indices of antisociality predict contamination-relevant behaviors. In a pre-registered study using an online U.S. sample, we found that individuals reporting high levels of antisociality engage in fewer social distancing measures: they report leaving their homes more frequently (p = .024) and standing closer to others while outside (p < .001). These relationships were observed after controlling for sociodemographic variables, illness risk, and use of protective equipment. Independently, higher education and leaving home for work were also associated with reduced distancing behavior. Antisociality was not significantly associated with level of worry about the coronavirus.

In South Africa, 55 421 cases have been confirmed as of 10 June 2020, with most cases in the Western Cape Province. Coronavirus leaves us in a position of uncertainty regarding the best clinical approach to successfully manage the expected high number of severely ill patients with COVID-19. This presents a unique opportunity to gather data to inform best practices in clinical approach and public health interventions to control COVID-19 locally. Furthermore, this pandemic challenges our resolve due to the high burden of HIV and tuberculosis (TB) in our country as data are scarce. This study endeavours to determine the clinical presentation, severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital.

The uncertainty of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic along with increased workload and difficult medical triage decisions may lead to a further decline in physician psychological health. METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, and PsycINFO for primary research from database inception (Medline [1946], EMBASE [1974], PsycINFO [1806]) to November 17, 2020. Titles and abstracts were screened by one of three reviewers and full-text article screening and data abstraction were conducted independently, and in duplicate, by three reviewers. RESULTS: From 6223 unique citations, 480 articles were reviewed in full-text, with 193 studies (of 90,499 physicians) included in the final review. Studies reported on physician psychological symptoms and management during seven infectious disease outbreaks (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], three strains of Influenza A virus [H1N1, H5N1, H7N9], Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS], and COVID-19) in 57 countries. Psychological symptoms of anxiety (14.3-92.3%), stress (11.9-93.7%), depression (17-80.5%), post-traumatic stress disorder (13.2-75.2%) and burnout (14.7-76%) were commonly reported among physicians, regardless of infectious disease outbreak or country. Younger, female (vs. male), single (vs. married), early career physicians, and those providing direct care to infected patients were associated with worse psychological symptoms. INTERPRETATION: Physicians should be aware that psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression, fear and distress are common, manifest differently and self-management strategies to improve psychological well-being exist. Health systems should implement short and long-term psychological supports for physicians caring for patients with COVID-19.","Fiest, Kirsten M; Parsons Leigh, Jeanna; Krewulak, Karla D; Plotnikoff, Kara M; Kemp, Laryssa G; Ng-Kamstra, Joshua; Stelfox, Henry T",BMC Psychiatry,87,16

471938,471938,471938,Vaccination: keep records secure with blockchain,12.451487,4.2879295,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The general objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that administration of convalescent plasma from donors with previous diagnosis of severe COVID-19 pneumonia is safe and associated with a decrease in all-cause in-hospital mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at 30 days in comparison with standard treatment alone. The secondary objectives are as follows: (1) to assess the efficacy of convalescent plasma to reduce the length of hospitalization, (2) to assess the efficacy of convalescent plasma to reduce the length of ICU stay, and (3) to assess the efficacy of convalescent plasma on reducing the requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation or ICU stay. TRIAL DESIGN: PERUCONPLASMA is a IIb phase open label, randomized, superiority clinical trial with 1:1 allocation taking place in real life routine clinical practice at public hospitals in Lima, Peru. Participants will be randomized to receive convalescent plasma along with local standard treatment or local standard treatment alone. After allocation, all participants will be followed for a total of 30 days or until hospital discharge, whichever occurs first. PARTICIPANTS: The population for the study are patients with severe disease with a confirmed laboratory test for SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized in 3 tertiary-care hospitals in Lima, Peru. Subjects are eligible for the trial if they meet all of the following inclusion criteria: 1. Age 18 or older 2. Hospitalization due to COVID-19 with laboratory confirmation (either with serologic, molecular, or antigen test along with a compatible clinical presentation) 3. Severe or critical COVID-19 disease Severe illness was defined by 2 or more of the following: Respiratory rate of 22 or more Hypoxemia with oxygen saturation equal or less than 93% Abnormal blood gas analysis (PaO2 < 60 mmHg, PaCO2 > 50 mmHg, or Pa/FiO2 < 300) Critical disease was defined by either: Mechanical ventilation requirement less than 72 h. Shock. 4. Capacity to provide informed consent (patient or patient's direct relative) 5. Availability of convalescent plasma units compatible with ABO blood type of the subject. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Subjects are not eligible for the trial if they meet any of the following criteria: 1. Contraindication for transfusion (e.g., prior anaphylaxis, congestive heart failure) 2. Hemodynamic instability (PA < 60 mmHg refractory to vasopressors) 3. Uncontrolled concomitant infections\ 4. Stupor or coma 5. Platelets < 50,000/µL or disseminated intravascular coagulation 6. Serum creatinine > 3.5 mg/dL or dialysis requirement 7. Total bilirubin > 6 mg/dL or jaundice of unknown etiology 8. Myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome 9. Active or recent (< 7 days) intracranial hemorrhage 10. Pregnancy Donors: The donors have to meet the following criteria: male between 30 and 60 years with a previous diagnosis of severe COVID-19-associated pneumonia within the last 3 months, with resolution of symptoms of at least 28 days. The rationale for including donors with severe disease is to maximize the probability of collecting convalescent plasma units with high titer of neutralizing antibodies, as the technology to measure this specific type of antibodies is not routinely available in Peru. Aliquots of plasma will be stored for future quantification of neutralizing antibodies. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Convalescent plasma from donors with previous severe COVID-19 is the investigational medical product. The experimental group will receive 1 to 2 units of 200 to 250 ml of convalescent plasma along with local standard treatment. The control group will receive local standard treatment alone. The participants randomized to plasma will have evaluations at 6 h and 24 h to specifically evaluate possible post transfusion events. All the participants will be evaluated at day 3, day 7, and day 30 after enrolment. MAIN OUTCOMES: Safety outcome: Incidence of serious adverse reactions related to convalescent plasma transfusion within 24 h after convalescent plasma administration. Efficacy outcomes: Mortality from any cause during hospitalization at 30 days post randomization. Length of hospitalization at 30 days post randomization or until hospital discharge. Duration of mechanical ventilation at 30 days post randomization or until hospital discharge. Length of hospitalization in an intensive care unit at 30 days post randomization or until hospital discharge. Exploratory: Oxygen requirement evolution at days 3 and 7. Score Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) evolution at days 3 and 7. Dynamics of inflammatory marker (lymphocyte, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) evolution at days 3 and 7. Proportion of patients progressing to multi-organ failure at 30 days post randomization or until hospital discharge. Proportion of transfusion related adverse reactions at 30 days post randomization or until hospital discharge. RANDOMIZATION: Randomization will be carried out within the electronic case report form (eCRF) in 1:1 ratio (receive plasma/control) in a randomization process established by blocks of size 2, 4, and 6. Allocation to the treatment arm of an individual patient will not be available to the investigators before completion of the whole randomization process. Randomization blocks will be performed with ""ralloc"", Stata's randomization process v.16.0. Randomization through the eCRF will be available 24 h every day. BLINDING (MASKING): Both the participants and study staff will be aware of the allocated intervention. Blinded statistical analysis will be performed. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): The sample size was calculated using the Fleiss formula with continuity correction to detect a mortality reduction from 50 to 20% between the two treatment arms with a confidence level of 95% and a power of 80%. Based on this information, a total of 45 patients per arm would be needed. After adjustment for a drop-out rate of 10% after enrolment, a total of 50 patients per arm (100 patients in total) will be enrolled.

While self-reports suggest that OPO noise is perceived as a stressor, there is little experimental research comprehensively investigating the effects of noise on employees in terms of their cognitive performance, physiological indicators of stress, and affect. Employing a simulated office setting, we compared the effects of a typical OPO auditory environment to a quieter private office auditory environment on a range of objective and subjective measures of well-being and performance. While OPO noise did not reduce immediate cognitive task performance compared to the quieter environment, it did reduce psychological well-being as evidenced by self-reports of mood, facial expressions of emotion, and physiological indicators of stress in the form of heartrate and skin conductivity. Our research highlights the importance of using a multimodal approach to assess the impact of workplace stressors such as noise. Such an approach will allow HR practitioners to make data-driven recommendations about the design and modification of workspaces to minimize negative effects and support employee well-being.

In Lombardy, the most affected area, the majority of public and private hospitals were dedicated to caring for COVID-19 patients and were organized following the 'Hub-and-Spoke' model for other medical specialties, like cardiac surgery and interventional procedures for congenital cardiac disease (CHD). Here, we report how the congenital cardiac care system was modified in Lombardy and the first results of this organization. METHODS: We describe a modified 'Hub-and-Spoke' model - that involves 59 birthplaces and three specialized Congenital Cardiac Centers -- and how the hub center organized his activity. We also reported the data of the consecutive cases hospitalized during this period. RESULTS: From 9 March to 15 April, we performed: a total of 21 cardiac surgeries, 4 diagnostic catheterizations, 3 CT scans, and 2 CMR. In three cases with prenatal diagnosis, the birth was scheduled. The spoke centers referred to our center six congenital cardiac cases. The postop ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation support was required in two cases; one case died. None of these patients nor their parents or accompanying person was found to be COVID-19-positive; 2 pediatric intensivists were found to be COVID-19-positive, and needed hospitalization without mechanical ventilation; 13 nurses had positive COVID swabs (4 with symptoms), and were managed and isolated at home. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data suggest that the model adopted met the immediate needs with a good outcome without increased mortality, nor COVID-19 exposure for the patients who underwent procedures.","Chessa, Massimo; Varrica, Alessandro; Andronache, Andreea; Carminati, Mario; Colli, Anna Maria; D039,; Aiello, Angelo Fabio; Ferrero, Paolo; Mannarino, Savina; Marcora, Simona; Marianeschi, Stefano Maria; Micheletti, Angelo; Piazza, Luciane; Saracino, Antonio; Uricchio, Nicola; Vignati, Gabriele; Giamberti, Alessandro",J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),87,1

The acidic pH environment of endosomes is believed to be essential for SARS-CoV-2 to be able to enter cells and begin replication. However, the clinical use of endosomal acidification inhibitors, typically chloroquine, has been controversial with this respect. METHODS: In this study, RT-qPCR method was used to detect the SARS-CoV-2N gene to evaluate viral replication. The CCK-8 assay was also used to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of SARS-CoV-2. In situ hybridization was used to examine the distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 gene in lung tissues. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was also used to evaluate virus-associated pathological changes in lung tissues. RESULTS: In this study, analysis showed that endosomal acidification inhibitors, including chloroquine, bafilomycin A1 and NH4CL, significantly reduced the viral yields of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6, Huh-7 and 293T-ACE2 cells. Chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 also improved the viability and proliferation of Vero E6 cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, in the hACE2 transgenic mice model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 reduced viral replication in lung tissues and alleviated viral pneumonia with reduced inflammatory exudation and infiltration in peribronchiolar and perivascular tissues, as well as improved structures of alveolar septum and pulmonary alveoli. CONCLUSIONS: Our research investigated the antiviral effects of endosomal acidification inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 in several infection models and provides an experimental basis for further mechanistic studies and drug development.","Shang, Chao; Zhuang, Xinyu; Zhang, He; Li, Yiquan; Zhu, Yilong; Lu, Jing; Ge, Chenchen; Cong, Jianan; Li, Tingyu; Tian, Mingyao; Jin, Ningyi; Li, Xiao",Virol J,87,33

A clearer understanding of which individuals are most at risk of over-eating during the lockdown period is needed to inform interventions that promote healthy diets and prevent weight gain during lockdowns. An online survey collected during the COVID-19 lockdown (total n = 875; analysed n = 588; 33.4 ± 12.6 years; 82% UK-based; mostly white, educated, and not home schooling) investigated reported changes to the amount consumed and changes to intake of high energy dense (HED) sweet and savoury foods. The study also assessed which eating behaviour traits predicted a reported increase of HED sweet and savoury foods and tested whether coping responses moderated this relationship. Results showed that 48% of participants reported increased food intake in response to the COVID-19 lockdown. There was large individual variability in reported changes and lower craving control was the strongest predictor of increased HED sweet and savoury food intake. Low cognitive restraint also predicted greater increases in HED sweet snacks and HED savoury meal foods. Food responsiveness, enjoyment of food, emotional undereating, emotional overeating and satiety responsiveness were not significant predictors of changes to HED sweet and savoury food intake. High scores on acceptance coping responses attenuated the conditional effects of craving control on HED sweet snack intake. Consistent with previous findings, the current research suggests that low craving control is a risk factor for increased snack food intake during lockdown and may therefore represent a target for intervention.","Buckland, Nicola J; Swinnerton, Lucy F; Ng, Kwok; Price, Menna; Wilkinson, Laura L; Myers, Anna; Dalton, Michelle",Appetite,87,20

These differences capture genuine uncertainty in the understanding of disease dynamics and in the choice of simplifying assumptions underpinning the model.

In additional 18,922 patients screened with swab pooling (1,344 pools), mean Cq differences between individual and pool samples ranged from 0.1 (Cr.I. -0.98 to 1.17) to 2.09 (Cr.I. 1.24 to 2.94). Overall, 19,535 asymptomatic patients were screened using 4,400 RT-qPCR assays. This corresponds to an increase of 4.4 times in laboratory capacity and a reduction of 77% in required tests. Therefore, swab pooling represents a major alternative for reliable and large-scale screening of SARS-CoV-2 in low prevalence populations.","Christoff, Ana Paula; Cruz, Giuliano Netto Flores; Sereia, Aline Fernanda Rodrigues; Boberg, Dellyana Rodrigues; de Bastiani, Daniela Carolina; Yamanaka, Laís Eiko; Fongaro, Gislaine; Stoco, Patrícia Hermes; Bazzo, Maria Luiza; Grisard, Edmundo Carlos; Hernandes, Camila; de Oliveira, Luiz Felipe Valter",PLoS One,87,26

This study aims to describe the clinical course of COVID-19 in children with kidney disease taking immunosuppressive medication and to assess disease severity. METHODS: Cross-sectional study hosted by the European Rare Kidney Disease Reference Network and supported by the European, Asian and International paediatric nephrology societies. Anonymised data were submitted online for any child (age <20 years) with COVID-19 taking immunosuppressive medication for a kidney condition. Study recruited for 16 weeks from 15 March 2020 to 05 July 2020. The primary outcome was severity of COVID-19. RESULTS: 113 children were reported in this study from 30 different countries. Median age: 13 years (49% male). Main underlying reasons for immunosuppressive therapy: kidney transplant (47%), nephrotic syndrome (27%), systemic lupus erythematosus (10%). Immunosuppressive medications used include: glucocorticoids (76%), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (54%), tacrolimus/ciclosporine A (58%), rituximab/ofatumumab (11%). 78% required no respiratory support during COVID-19 illness, 5% required bi-level positive airway pressure or ventilation. Four children died; all deaths reported were from low-income countries with associated comorbidities. There was no significant difference in severity of COVID-19 based on gender, dialysis status, underlying kidney condition, and type or number of immunosuppressive medications. CONCLUSIONS: This global study shows most children with a kidney disease taking immunosuppressive medication have mild disease with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We therefore suggest that children on immunosuppressive therapy should not be more strictly isolated than children who are not on immunosuppressive therapy.","Marlais, Matko; Wlodkowski, Tanja; Al-Akash, Samhar; Ananin, Petr; Bandi, Varun Kumar; Baudouin, Veronique; Boyer, Olivia; Vásquez, Luciola; Govindan, Sukanya; Hooman, Nakysa; Ijaz, Iftikhar; Loza, Reyner; Melgosa, Marta; Pande, Nivedita; Pape, Lars; Saha, Anshuman; Samsonov, Dmitry; Schreuder, Michiel F; Sharma, Jyoti; Siddiqui, Sahar; Sinha, Rajiv; Stewart, Heather; Tasic, Velibor; Tönshoff, Burkhard; Twombley, Katherine; Upadhyay, Kiran; Vivarelli, Marina; Weaver, Donald J; Woroniecki, Robert; Schaefer, Franz; Tullus, Kjell",Arch. dis. child,87,20

Here, we show that functionalized nanoparticles, termed ""Nanotraps,"" completely inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the interaction between the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2 of host cells. The liposomal-based Nanotrap surfaces were functionalized with either recombinant ACE2 proteins or anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and phagocytosis-specific phosphatidylserines. The Nanotraps effectively captured SARS-CoV-2 and completely blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection to ACE2-expressing human cell lines and primary lung cells; the phosphatidylserine triggered subsequent phagocytosis of the virus-bound, biodegradable Nanotraps by macrophages, leading to the clearance of pseudotyped and authentic virus in vitro. Furthermore, the Nanotraps demonstrated an excellent biosafety profile in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the Nanotraps inhibited pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection in live human lungs in an ex vivo lung perfusion system.

METHODS: A broad literature search was done for published articles that reported on histopathological findings of the brain in patients with COVID-19 in PubMed by MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL by the Cochrane Library, and SCOPUS from December 31, 2019 to October 31, 2020. RESULTS: The systematic literature search strategy used resulted in a total of 1608 articles of which 14 were included in the analysis (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020221022). There were ten case series, two case reports, one retrospective cohort, and one prospective cohort. The age of the patients ranged between 38 and 90 years old, most of them older than 65 years old (n=66, 45.2%) and males (n=79, 54.1%). Most tested negative in SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry (n=70, 47.9%). The striking pathologic changes included diffuse edema (n=25, 17.1%), gliosis with diffuse activation of microglia and astrocytes (n=52, 35.6%), infarctions involving cortical and subcortical areas of the brain (n=4, 2.7%), intracranial bleed (subarachnoid hemorrhage and punctate hemorrhages) (n=18, 12.4%), arteriosclerosis (n=43, 29.5%), hypoxic-ischemic injury (n=41, 28.1%), and signs of inflammation (n=52, 35.6%). The cause of death was attributed to the cardiorespiratory system (n=66, 45.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The neuropathologic changes observed likely represent direct cytopathic effects and indirect effects secondary to host-specific inflammatory response induced by the viral infection. Further studies however are required to better elucidate the pathologic mechanism.","Pajo, Azalea T; Espiritu, Adrian I; Apor, Almira Doreen Abigail O; Jamora, Roland Dominic G",Neurol. sci,87,20

As they differentiate, HSCs yield a series of cell states that undergo gradual commitment to become mature blood cells. Studies of hematopoiesis in murine models have provided critical insights about the lineage relationships among stem cells, progenitors, and mature cells and these have guided investigations of the molecular basis for these distinct developmental stages. Primary immune deficiencies are caused by inborn errors of immunity that result in immune dysfunction and subsequent susceptibility to severe and recurrent infection(s). Over the last decade there has been a dramatic increase in the number and depth of the molecular, cellular, and clinical characterization of such genetically defined causes of immune dysfunction. Patients harboring inborn errors of immunity thus represent a unique resource to improve our understanding of the multilayered and complex mechanisms underlying lymphocyte development in humans. These breakthrough discoveries not only enable significant advances in the diagnosis of such rare and complex conditions but also provide substantial improvement in the development of personalized treatments. Here, we will discuss the clinical, cellular and molecular phenotypes, and treatments of selected inborn errors of immunity that impede, either intrinsically or extrinsically, the development of B- or T-cells at different stages.","Della Mina, Erika; Guérin, Antoine; Tangye, Stuart G",Stem cells (Dayt.),87,9

In 2018, the Vietnam Ministry of Health (MOH) conducted a full-scale exercise (FSX) in response to cases of severe viral pneumonia with subsequent laboratory confirmation for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) to evaluate the country's early warning and response capabilities for high-risk events. METHODS: An exercise planning team designed a complex fictitious scenario beginning with one case of severe viral pneumonia presenting at the hospital level and developed all the materials required for the exercise. Actors, controllers and evaluators were trained. In August 2018, a 3-day exercise was conducted in Quang Ninh province and Hanoi city, with participation of public health partners at the community, district, province, regional and national levels. Immediate debriefings and an after-action review were conducted after all exercise activities. Participants assessed overall exercise design, conduction and usefulness. RESULTS: FSX findings demonstrated that the event-based surveillance component of the MOH surveillance system worked optimally at different administrative levels. Detection and reporting of signals at the community and health facility levels were appropriate. Triage, verification and risk assessment were successfully implemented to identify a high-risk event and trigger timely response. The FSX identified infection control, coordination with internal and external response partners and process documentation as response challenges. Participants positively evaluated the exercise training and design. CONCLUSIONS: This exercise documents the value of exercising surveillance capabilities as part of a real-time operational scenario before facing a true emergency. The timing of this exercise and choice of disease scenario was particularly fortuitous given the subsequent appearance of COVID-19. As a result of this exercise and subsequent improvements made by the MOH, the country may have been better able to deal with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and contain it.","Clara, Alexey; Dao, Anh T P; Tran, Quy; Tran, Phu D; Dang, Tan Q; Nguyen, Huong T; Tran, Quang D; Rzeszotarski, Peter; Talbert, Karen; Stehling-Ariza, Tasha; Veasey, Frances; Clemens, Lynne; Mounts, Anthony W; Lofgren, Hannah; Balajee, S Arunmozhi; Do, Trang T",BMC Public Health,87,1

METHODS: 144 individuals participated in the present study and were randomly allocated to three mask groups of 48 (N95, SURGICAL, and NO MASK) with two exercise subgroups for each mask group (MAX, n = 24; SUB, n = 24) for both sexes. Participants in each experimental group (N95SUB, N95MAX; SURSUB, SURMAX; SUB, MAX) were assessed for their hemodynamic and hematologic function at baseline and during recovery after exercise. RESULTS: No significant differences were noted for either hemodynamic or hematologic function at post-exercise as compared to baseline with regard to mask modality (P > 0.05). Heart rate (HR) for maximal intensity were significantly greater at 1 min post-exercise in N95 as compared to SURGICAL (P < 0.05). No differences were noted for hemodynamic and hematologic function with N95 and SURGICAL compared to NOMASK for either intensity (P > 0.05). Females showed significantly greater HR values at 1 min post-exercise in N95 as compared to NO MASK, but no significant differences were noted for hematological function between sexes (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings show that wearing a face mask (N95/surgical) while exercising has no detrimental effects on hemodynamic/hematologic function in both males and females, and suggest that wearing a mask, particularly a surgical mask, while exercising during the ongoing pandemic is safe and poses no risk to individual's health.

Using this assay, we analyzed 61 convalescent serum samples from adults with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and 15 samples from healthy uninfected controls. We found that 56 of 61 convalescent serum samples induced ADCC killing of SARS-CoV-2 S target cells, whereas none of the 15 healthy controls had detectable ADCC. We then found a modest decline in ADCC titer over a median 3-month follow-up in 21 patients who had serial samples available for analysis.

The virus uses ACE2 receptor for viral entry. ACE2 is part of the counter-regulatory renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and is also expressed in the lower respiratory tract along the alveolar epithelium. There is, however, significant controversy regarding the role of ACE2 expression in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Some have argued that decreasing ACE2 expression would result in decreased susceptibility to the virus by decreasing available binding sites for SARS-CoV-2 and restricting viral entry into the cells. Others have argued that, like the pathogenesis of other viral pneumonias, including those stemming from previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viruses, once SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, it downregulates ACE2 expression. Lack of the favourable effects of ACE2 might exaggerate lung injury by a variety of mechanisms. In order to help address this controversy, we conducted a literature search and review of relevant preclinical and clinical publications pertaining to SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, ACE2, viral pneumonia, SARS, acute respiratory distress syndrome and lung injury. Our review suggests, although controversial, that patients at increased susceptibility to COVID-19 complications may have reduced baseline ACE2, and by modulating ACE2 expression one can possibly improve COVID-19 outcomes. Herein, we elucidate why and how this potential mechanism might work.","Chaudhry, Farhan; Lavandero, Sergio; Xie, Xiang; Sabharwal, Basera; Zheng, Ying-Ying; Correa, Ashish; Narula, Jagat; Levy, Phillip",,87,16

This paper aims to design and develop a novel ensemble-based classifier to predict COVID-19 cases at a very early stage so that appropriate action can be taken by patients, doctors, health organizations, and the government. In this paper, a synthetic dataset of COVID-19 is generated by a dataset generation algorithm. A novel ensemble-based classifier of machine learning is employed on the COVID-19 dataset to predict the disease. A convex hull-based approach is also applied to the data to improve the proposed novel, ensemble-based classifier's accuracy and speed. The model is designed and developed through the python programming language and compares with the most popular classifier, i.e., Decision Tree, ID3, and support vector machine. The results indicate that the proposed novel classifier provides a more significant precision, kappa static, root means a square error, recall, F-measure, and accuracy.","Singh, Prabh Deep; Kaur, Rajbir; Singh, Kiran Deep; Dhiman, Gaurav",Inf Syst Front,87,1

Detailed scientific knowledge of the members of the Coronaviridae family, including the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is currently lacking. Structural studies of the MERS-CoV proteins in the current literature are extremely limited. We present here detailed characterization of the structural properties of MERS-CoV macro domain in aqueous solution. Additionally, we studied the impacts of chosen force field parameters and parallel tempering simulation techniques on the predicted structural properties of MERS-CoV macro domain in aqueous solution. For this purpose, we conducted extensive Hamiltonian-replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations and Temperature-replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations using the CHARMM36m and AMBER99SB parameters for the macro domain. This study shows that the predicted secondary structure properties including their propensities depend on the chosen simulation technique and force field parameter. We perform structural clustering based on the radius of gyration and end-to-end distance of MERS-CoV macro domain in aqueous solution. We also report and analyze the residue-level intrinsic disorder features, flexibility and secondary structure. Furthermore, we study the propensities of this macro domain for protein-protein interactions and for the RNA and DNA binding. Overall, results are in agreement with available nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings and present more detailed insights into the structural properties of MERS CoV macro domain in aqueous solution. All in all, we present the structural properties of the aqueous MERS-CoV macro domain using different parallel tempering simulation techniques, force field parameters and bioinformatics tools.","Akbayrak, Ibrahim Yagiz; Caglayan, Sule Irem; Durdagi, Serdar; Kurgan, Lukasz; Uversky, Vladimir N; Ulver, Burak; Dervisoglu, Havvanur; Haklidir, Mehmet; Hasekioglu, Orkun; Coskuner-Weber, Orkid",Proteins,87,16

Memories of the 1918 Spanish Flu were rekindled raising extreme fear for the virus, but in essence, it was the host and not the virus, which was deciding the outcome of the infection. Age, gender, and preexisting conditions played critical roles in shaping COVID-19 outcome. People of lower socioeconomic strata were disproportionately affected in industrialized countries such as the United States. India, a developing country with more than 1.3 billion population, a large proportion of it being underprivileged and with substandard public health provider infrastructure, feared for the worst outcome given the sheer size and density of its population. Six months into the pandemic, a comparison of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality data between India, the United States, and several European countries, reveal interesting trends. While most developed countries show curves expected for a fast-spreading respiratory virus, India seems to have a slower trajectory. As a consequence, India may have gained on two fronts: the spread of the infection is unusually prolonged, thus leading to a curve that is ""naturally flattened""; concomitantly the mortality rate, which is a reflection of the severity of the disease has been relatively low. I hypothesize that trained innate immunity, a new concept in immunology, may be the phenomenon behind this.

Surveys were analysed using descriptive statistics; interviews and open text responses were interpreted through qualitative analysis. Findings revealed students found communication from hospitals and universities to be confusing, inconsistent and they relied on mass media and each other to remain updated. Moving to online learning and being isolated from peers made learning difficult. During clinical placements, students felt expendable in terms of their value and contribution, reflected in essential equipment such as personal protective equipment not always being available to them. Witnessing perceived compromised midwifery care increased students' emotional burden, while personal household responsibilities and financial concerns were problematic.

Interpretation of thyroid tests during illness, however, is hampered by changes occurring in the context of non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS). In order to elucidate these findings, we studied thyroid function in carefully selected cohorts of COVID-19 positive and negative patients. DESIGN: Cohort observational study. METHODS: We measured TSH, FT4, T3 within 24hours of admission in 196 patients without thyroid disease and/or confounding medications. 102 patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive; 41 admitted in the ICU, 46 in the ward and 15 outpatients. Controls consisted of 94 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients; 39 in the ICU and 55 in the ward. We designated the thyroid hormone patterns as consistent with NTIS, thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism. RESULTS: A NTIS pattern was encountered in 60% of ICU and 36% of ward patients, with similar frequencies between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients (46.0% vs 46.8%, p=NS). A thyrotoxicosis pattern was observed in 14.6% SARS-CoV-2 ICU patients vs. 7.7% in ICU negative (p=NS) and, overall in 8.8% of SARS-CoV-2 positive vs. 7.4% of negative patients. In these patients thyroglobulin levels were similar to those with normal thyroid function or NTIS. The hypothyroidism pattern was rare. CONCLUSIONS: NTIS pattern is common and relates to the severity of disease rather than SARS-CoV-2 infection. A thyrotoxicosis pattern is less frequently observed with similar frequency between patients with and without COVID-19. It is suggested that thyroid hormone monitoring in COVID-19 should not differ from other critically ill patients.","Vassiliadi, Dimitra Argyro; Ilias, Ioannis; Pratikaki, Maria; Jahaj, Edison; Vassiliou, Alice G; Detsika, Maria; Ampelakiotou, Kleio; Koulenti, Marina; Manolopoulos, Konstantinos N; Tsipilis, Stamatis; Gavrielatou, Evdokia; Diamantopoulos, Aristeidis; Zacharis, Alexandros; Athanasiou, Nicolaos; Orfanos, Stylianos; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Tsagarakis, Stylianos; Dimopoulou, Ioanna",,87,0

However, few studies have investigated the role of diet-alone interventions in improving individuals' weight gain by taking AAPs. In closed management mental hospitals of China, family members are allowed to bring food to patients regularly, causing patients to have caloric intake added to their 3 daily meals. However, during the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), bringing food to the hospital was temporarily prohibited in mental health institutions in China to prevent the spread of the virus. This study sought to compare the body weight and body mass index (BMI) changes of patients taking olanzapine or clozapine undergoing diet-alone interventions caused by this prohibition. METHODS: A retrospective self-controlled study was conducted on 90 patients with schizophrenia from a single-center treated with olanzapine or clozapine monotherapy, or combined with aripiprazole or ziprasidone which has a small metabolic impact. A paired-samples t-test was used to compare the changes in body weight and BMI before and after the 3-month prohibition, and general linear regression was used to analyze the effects of gender, age, disease course, duration of drug exposure, and equivalent dose on the BMI improvement. Also, the percentage of people who lost weight and that of individuals who lost 5% of their pre-prohibition body weight were calculated. RESULTS: Paired-samples t-test showed that after 3-month prohibition, the patients' body weight (71.68±6.83 vs. 66.91±7.03, P<0.001) and BMI (26.43±2.11 vs. 24.63±1.81, P<0.001) decreased significantly. Weight loss rate accounted for 99.1%, and weight loss of 5% from the pre-prohibition body weight accounted for 71.8%. General linear regression showed that the duration of drug exposure (ß =-0.678, P<0.001) was significantly and negatively correlated with the BMI changes. No significant correlation of gender, age, disease course, or equivalent dose with BMI changes was found. CONCLUSIONS: Diet-alone interventions facilitate weight loss in chronically hospitalized schizophrenia patients taking AAPs. Conduction of dietary intervention in the early stages of medication may yield greater benefits.","Zhang, Chengfang; Wang, Xiaodan; Hu, Chengping; Ding, Wenhua; Li, Han; Wu, Meng; Hu, Manji; Wang, Qiang; Sun, Xirong",Ann Palliat Med,87,16

Governments and key institutions have had to implement decisive responses to the danger posed by the coronavirus pandemic. Imposed change will increase the likelihood that alternative explanations take hold. In a proportion of the general population there may be strong scepticism, fear of being misled, and false conspiracy theories. Our objectives were to estimate the prevalence of conspiracy thinking about the pandemic and test associations with reduced adherence to government guidelines. METHODS: A non-probability online survey with 2501 adults in England, quota sampled to match the population for age, gender, income, and region. RESULTS: Approximately 50% of this population showed little evidence of conspiracy thinking, 25% showed a degree of endorsement, 15% showed a consistent pattern of endorsement, and 10% had very high levels of endorsement. Higher levels of coronavirus conspiracy thinking were associated with less adherence to all government guidelines and less willingness to take diagnostic or antibody tests or to be vaccinated. Such ideas were also associated with paranoia, general vaccination conspiracy beliefs, climate change conspiracy belief, a conspiracy mentality, and distrust in institutions and professions. Holding coronavirus conspiracy beliefs was also associated with being more likely to share opinions. CONCLUSIONS: In England there is appreciable endorsement of conspiracy beliefs about coronavirus. Such ideas do not appear confined to the fringes. The conspiracy beliefs connect to other forms of mistrust and are associated with less compliance with government guidelines and greater unwillingness to take up future tests and treatment.","Freeman, Daniel; Waite, Felicity; Rosebrock, Laina; Petit, Ariane; Causier, Chiara; East, Anna; Jenner, Lucy; Teale, Ashley-Louise; Carr, Lydia; Mulhall, Sophie; Bold, Emily; Lambe, Sinéad",Psychol Med,87,1

We reviewed the literature for cases of documented reinfection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive computerized search in PubMed, through 15 December 2020, using the following terms in combination: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, reinfection, reactivation, recurrence. To exclude cases due to prolonged viral shedding or protracted infection, only cases occurring at least 12 weeks apart or confirmed as being sustained by genetically different viruses by viral genome analysis were included. RESULTS: We identified 23 cases globally, for which viral genome analysis was performed in 10 cases and serology in 19 cases. The mean interval between the two episodes was 15 weeks. Mean age of cases was 44.5 years, and 10 (43.5%) were women. In 17/23 cases, no comorbidity was observed. In 10 cases, the first episode was more severe than the ensuing episode, whereas in seven cases the ensuing episode was more severe. In four cases, there was no difference in severity and in two cases both episodes were asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: From this sample of 23 cases, a clear pattern of the second episode being less or more severe did not emerge. A better understanding of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, necessary to assess the probability of a second infection and the durability of protection conferred by vaccination, is warranted.","Roberts, Anna Teresa; Piani, Fiorella; Longo, Benedetta; Andreini, Roberto; Meini, Simone",Infect Dis (Lond),87,23

Manual cleaning and disinfection measures do not always achieve sufficient removal of surface contamination. This increases the importance of automated solutions in the context of final disinfection of rooms in the hospital setting. Ozone is a highly effective disinfectant which, combined with high humidity, is an effective agent against respiratory viruses. Current devices allow continuous nebulization for high room humidity as well as ozone production without any consumables. AIM: In the following study, the effectiveness of a fully automatic room decontamination system based on ozone was tested against bacteriophage &#934;6 (phi 6) and bovine coronavirus L9, as surrogate viruses for the pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: For this purpose, various surfaces (ceramic tile, stainless steel surface and furniture board) were soiled with the surrogate viruses and placed at two different levels in a gas-tight test room. After using the automatic decontamination device according to the manufacturer's instructions, the surrogate viruses were recovered from the surfaces and examined by quantitative cultures. Then, reduction factors were calculated. FINDINGS: The ozone-based room decontamination device achieved virucidal efficacy (reduction factor >4 log10) against both surrogate organisms regardless of the different surfaces and positions confirming a high activity under the used conditions. CONCLUSION: Ozone is highly active against SARS-CoV-2 surrogate organisms. Further investigations are necessary for a safe application and efficacy in practice as well as integration into routine processes.","Franke, G; Knobling, B; Brill, F H; Becker, B; Klupp, E M; Belmar Campos, C; Pfefferle, S; Lütgehetmann, M; Knobloch, J K",J Hosp Infect,87,3

Hospital admissions mitigate positive sampling bias in PCR tests due to their initially limited test numbers and application as a diagnostic, instead of a surveying tool. As of July 31, the United States' cumulative recovered population is estimated at 47% or 155 million. The remaining susceptible population is 53%, or 47% excepting the 6% infectious population. The estimated mortality rate of the cumulative recovered population is 0.09% death per case. New York and Massachusetts show SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 87% and 55%, respectively. Likewise, each state exhibits relatively low current positive PCR results at 1 % and 1.7%. Also, these states show about twice the mortality rate of the nation. Florida, California, and Texas showed recovered population percent around 40%, higher current PCR positive test results ranging from 7% to 13%. A higher recovered population mitigates the current positive value attainable by limiting the infectivity rate Re. This approach provides an alternate source of information on the pandemic's full time course since the serological testing only views a narrow time slice of its history due to the transient nature of the antibody response and its graduated expression dependency on the severity of the disease.

We have previously shown that conditioned media from infected glial cell cultures (supernatants) contain a factor unrelated to infectious virus and capable of inducing H-2 class I antigens on uninfected glial cells. The synthesis of this factor appears to be dependent on production of infectious virus since the H-2 inducing activity could not be detected 3 days following the addition of neutralizing antibodies to the cultures. This suggests that H-2 inducing activity contains as unstable component, the synthesis of which is dependent on continual virus production.

The firms in the survey report that the decline in foreign demand is the single most important reason for their deteriorating business situation. Firms that faced a more difficult business situation before the crisis are affected more severely during the crisis. Moreover, we investigate the impact of the Swiss federal loan program (Bundeshilfe) on the business activities. To this end, we develop a stylized theoretical model of financially constrained heterogeneous firms. We find that policy makers face a trade-off between immediate higher unemployment rates and long-term higher public spending. The former arises from a combination of a too strong economic impact of the COVID-19 lockdown (demand drop) and too low levels of loans provided. Nevertheless, providing (too) high levels of loans to firms creates zombie firms that are going to default in the future leading to an increase in public spending.

Chronic exposure to hazardous chemicals at work can lead to serious illnesses, contributing to health inequities. In this article, we expand on theories of ‘responsibilization’ in an occupational health context to reveal how responsibilities for workplace chemical exposures are negotiated by workers and owners in Latinx-owned small businesses. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with a total of 22 workers and owners in auto repair shops and beauty salons – two high-risk industries – in Southern Metropolitan Tucson. Participants were asked about their insights into workplace chemical exposures and health. A qualitative analysis team with representation from all study partner organizations collectively coded and reviewed the interview data in QSR International’s NVivo 11 and identified overarching themes across the interviews. RESULTS: We identified three primary themes: 1) ambivalence toward risks in the workplace; 2) shifting responsibilities for exposure protection at work; and 3) reflections on the system behind chemical exposure risks. Participants discussed the complexities that small businesses face in reducing chemical exposures. CONCLUSIONS: Through our analysis of the interviews, we examine how neoliberal occupational and environmental policies funnel responsibility for controlling chemical exposures down to individuals in small businesses with limited resources, obscuring the power structures that maintain environmental health injustices. We conclude with a call for upstream policy changes that more effectively regulate and hold accountable the manufacturers of chemical products used daily by small business workers.

Many of the changes introduced to the regulation of pharmacy services in Ireland have been replicated in other countries including the introduction of electronic means to transmit prescriptions and other orders for medications, relaxing the legal restrictions in place controlling the emergency supply of prescription only medicines and more fully utilizing the professional competency of pharmacists by empowering them to use their expertise and judgment to support their patients accessing the healthcare services that they need. Many of the regulatory changes that have been introduced to support the COVID-19 public health emergency effort are ones that pharmacists have previously sought to enable them provide a more effective and expanded model of pharmaceutical care to their patients. Accordingly, many pharmacists will want these regulatory changes to be retained and further expanded in the aftermath of the COVID-19 public health emergency in order to extend their scope of practice and support them in the care of their patients.","Lynch, Matthew; O'Leary, Aisling",Res Social Adm Pharm,87,16

However, many hospitals in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) may not have access to central lines and the vasoactive medications are frequently given through a peripheral venous access. Aim: The aim of our study was to describe the role of peripheral vasoactive inotropes in children. Methods: Children requiring peripheral vasoactive medications were included in this study. We retrospectively collected data at 2 time points on use and complications of peripheral vasoactive medications. Results: Eighty-four children (51 pre-COVID era and 33 COVID pandemic) received peripheral vasoactive medications. Only 3% of children (3/84) developed extravasation injury, all of whom recovered completely.

Despite the wide outbreak of the infection, a remarkable asymmetry is observed in the number of cases and in the distribution of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms in patients with respect to the countries/regions. In the early stages of a new pathogen outbreak, it is critical to understand the dynamics of the infection transmission, in order to follow contagion over time and project the epidemiological situation in the near future. While it is possible to reason that observed variation in the number and severity of cases stems from the initial number of infected individuals, the difference in the testing policies and social aspects of community transmissions, the factors that could explain high discrepancy in areas with a similar level of healthcare still remain unknown. Here, we introduce a binary classifier based on an artificial neural network that can help in explaining those differences and that can be used to support the design of containment policies. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection frequency positively correlates with particulate air pollutants, and specifically with particulate matter 2.5 (PM(2.5)), while ozone gas is oppositely related with the number of infected individuals. We propose that atmospheric air pollutants could thus serve as surrogate markers to complement the infection outbreak anticipation.","Fronza, Raffaele; Lusic, Marina; Schmidt, Manfred; Lucic, Bojana",Viruses,87,1

Therefore, continuous monitoring of IBV genotypes and lineages recently circulating in chickens worldwide is essential. In this study, we characterized the complete S1 gene from 120 IBVs circulating in chickens in Thailand from 2014 to 2016. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete S1 gene of 120 Thai IBVs revealed that the 2014–2016 Thai IBVs were divided into 3 lineages (GI-1, GI-13, and GI-19) and a novel IBV variant. Our results also showed that GI-19 lineage has become the predominant lineage of IBV circulating in chicken flocks in Thailand from 2014 to 2016. It is interesting to note that a novel IBV variant, which was genetically different from the established IBV lineages, was identified in this study. The recombination analysis demonstrated that this novel IBV variant was a recombinant virus, which was originated from the GI-19 and GI-13 lineage viruses. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the circulation of different lineages of IBV and the presence of a novel recombinant IBV variant in chicken flocks in Thailand. This study highlights the high genetic diversity and continued evolution of IBVs in chickens in Thailand, and the importance of continued IBV surveillance for effective control and prevention of IB.","Munyahongse, Sirorat; Pohuang, Tawatchai; Nonthabenjawan, Nutthawan; Sasipreeyajan, Jiroj; Thontiravong, Aunyaratana",Poultry Science,87,1

We described the application of the Korean response system in one province and outlined the epidemiological features of COVID-19 in the cohort. METHODS: A Rapid Response Team tracked the patients’ activities and identified close contacts. A Patient Management Team made decisions regarding the severity of illness, hospital allocation depending on severity, and time of discharge. A national medical center with 155 beds and 4 university-affiliated hospitals with 48 negative-pressure isolation rooms were dedicated for COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: As of April 15, 17 400 residents were tested, of whom 111 were confirmed positive cases. Of the 111 patients, 78 were cured and discharged, 2 recovered after mechanical ventilation, and none died. One healthcare worker at the national center tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. All 412 staff members at the center were tested, but there were no additional infections. Cough (30.0 %) was the most common initial symptom, whereas anosmia and ageusia were the first symptoms in 14.7% and 15.7% of the patients, respectively. Overall, 25 patients (22.5%) reported having no symptoms at admission and 7 (6.3%) remained asymptomatic at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: A response system that enabled the early detection of COVID-19 cases, including asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases, and timely quarantine of these patients and their contacts, along with efficient allocation of medical resources, was the key to curbing the COVID-19 outbreak in Gyeongsangnam-do Province.","Wi, Yu Mi; Lim, Su Jin; Kim, Si-Ho; Lim, Seungjin; Lee, Su Jin; Ryu, Byung-Han; Hong, Sun In; Cho, Oh-Hyun; Moon, Kyunglan; Hong, Kyung-Wook; Kim, Sunjoo; Bae, In-Gyu",Clin Infect Dis,87,20

Each of these subtypes has a different natural history and prognostic profile. Although tumour staging (TNM classification) still provides valuable information in the overall management of breast cancer, the current reality is that clinicians must consider other biological and molecular factors that directly influence treatment decision-making, including extent of surgery, indication for chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and even radiotherapy (and treatment volumes). The management of breast cancer has changed radically in the last 15 years due to significant advances in our understanding of these tumours. While these changes have been extremely positive in terms of surgical and systemic management, they have also created significant uncertainties concerning integration of local and locoregional radiotherapy into the therapeutic scheme. In parallel, radiotherapy itself has also experienced major advances. Beyond the evident technological advances, new radiobiological concepts have emerged, and genomic data and other patient-specific factors must now be integrated into individualized treatment approaches. In this context, “precision medicine” seeks to provide an answer to these open questions and uncertainties. Although precision medicine has been much discussed in the last five years or so, the concept remains somewhat ambiguous, and it often appear to be used as a “catch-all” term. The present review aims to clarify the meaning of this term and, more importantly, to critically evaluate the role and impact of precision medicine on breast cancer radiotherapy. Finally, we will discuss the current and future of precision medicine in radiotherapy.","Jiang, Man; Yang, Jianshe; Li, Kang; Liu, Jia; Jing, Xigang; Tang, Meiqin",Int J Med Sci,87,16

We considered three highly contagious viruses that infect a wide range of domestic and wild mammals: canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), canine distemper virus (CDV) and canine enteric coronaviruses (CECoV). Infection by either one of these viruses can affect populations through increased mortality and/or decreased general health. We investigated infection in the wolf populations of Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise National Park (PNALM), Italy, and of Mercantour National Park (PNM), France. Faecal samples were collected during one winter, from October to March, from four packs in PNALM (n = 79) and from four packs in PNM (n = 66). We screened samples for specific sequences of viral nucleic acids. To our knowledge, our study is the first documented report of CECoV infection in wolves outside Alaska, and of the large-scale occurrence of CPV-2 in European wolf populations. The results suggest that CPV-2 is enzootic in the population of PNALM, but not in PNM and that CECoV is episodic in both areas. We did not detect CDV. Our findings suggest that density and spatial distribution of susceptible hosts, in particular free-ranging dogs, can be important factors influencing infections in wolves. This comparative study is an important step in evaluating the nature of possible disease threats in the studied wolf populations. Recent emergence of new viral strains in Europe additionally strengthens the need for proactive monitoring of wolves and other susceptible sympatric species for viral threats and other impairing infections.","Molnar, Barbara; Duchamp, Christophe; Möstl, Karin; Diehl, Peter-Allan; Betschart, Bruno",Eur,87,20

Cytomegalovirus (CMV), a persistent herpesvirus infection whose prevalence increases with age, is a major modulator of immune function and several observations suggest that infection might act to influence clinical outcome following SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, CMV is associated with the acceleration of immune senescence and has been linked to a range of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders.

Outcome variables were NO, MILD, SEVERE respiratory distress (RD) operationally defined and DEATH. Hypertension was the single most frequent comorbidity (221/431 = 51%). Distribution of antihypertensive treatment was: ACEIs 77/221 (35%), ARBs 63/221 (28%), OTHER than ACEIs or ARBs 64/221 (29%). In 17/221 (8%) antihypertensive medication was unknown.

Part of this canon involves the idea that virulence and free-living survival (a key component of transmission) may have different relationships in different host–parasite systems. Most examinations of the evolution of virulence-transmission relationships—Theoretical or empirical in nature—Tend to focus on the evolution of virulence, with transmission being a secondary consideration. Even within transmission studies, the focus on free-living survival is a smaller subset, though recent studies have examined its importance in the ecology of infectious diseases. Few studies have examined the epidemic-scale consequences of variation in survival across different virulence–survival relationships. In this study, we utilize a mathematical model motivated by aspects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) natural history to investigate how evolutionary changes in survival may influence several aspects of disease dynamics at the epidemiological scale. Across virulence–survival relationships (where these traits are either positively or negatively correlated), we found that small changes (5% above and below the nominal value) in survival can have a meaningful effect on certain outbreak features, including R(0), and on the size of the infectious peak in the population. These results highlight the importance of properly understanding the mechanistic relationship between virulence and parasite survival, as the evolution of increased survival across different relationships with virulence may have considerably different epidemiological signatures.","Gomez, Lourdes M.; Meszaros, Victor A.; Turner, Wendy C.; Ogbunugafor, C.

We aimed to describe the characteristics of patients transported by the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) for confirmed or suspected Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to investigate surge capacity of, and operational implications for, the RFDS in dealing with COVID-19. METHODS: Prospective cohort study. To determine the characteristics of patients transported for confirmed or suspected COVID-19, we included patient data from 02 February 2020 to 06 May 2020. To investigate surge capacity and operational implications for RFDS in dealing with COVID-19, we built, and validated, an interactive operations area level discrete-event simulation decision support model, underpinned by RFDS aeromedical activity data from 2015 to 2019 (4-years). This model was subsequently used in a factorial in silico experiment to systematically investigate both the supply of RFDS aeromedical services and the increased rates of demand for these services, for diseases of the respiratory system. RESULTS: The RFDS conducted 291 patient episodes of care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19. This included 288 separate patients, including 136 males and 119 females (gender missing=33), with a median age of 62.0 years (IQR=43.5-74.9). The simulation decision support model we developed is capable of providing dynamic and real-time support for RFDS decision-makers in understanding the system's performance under uncertain COVID-19 demand. With increased COVID-19 related demand, the ability of the RFDS to cope will be driven by the number of aircraft available. The simulation model provided each aviation section with estimated numbers of aircraft required to meet a range of anticipated demands. CONCLUSION: Despite the lack of certainty in the actual level of COVID-19 related demand for RFDS services, modelling demonstrates that robustness of meeting such demand increases with the number of operational and medically staffed aircraft.","Gardiner, Fergus W; Johns, Hannah; Bishop, Lara; Churilov, Leonid",Air Med J,87,29

Growing evidence indicates that COVID-19 frequently causes coagulopathy, presenting as hypercoagulation and incidental thrombosis. For these reasons, a multifactorial approach with several anticoagulant markers should be considered in the management of anticoagulation using heparin in COVID-19 patients on V-V ECMO. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 48-year-old man was infected with COVID-19 with a worsening condition manifesting as acute respiratory distress syndrome. DIAGNOSES: He was refractory to conventional therapy, thus we decided to introduce V-V ECMO. We used heparin as an anticoagulant therapy for V-V ECMO and adjusted the doses of heparin by careful monitoring of the activated clotting time (ACT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) to avoid both hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications. We controlled the doses of heparin in the therapeutic ranges of ACT and APTT, but clinical hemorrhaging and profound elevation of coagulant marker became apparent. INTERVENTIONS: Using thromboelastography (TEG; Haemonetics) in addition to ACT and APTT, we were able to clearly detect not only sufficient coagulability of COVID19 on V-V ECMO (citrated rapid thromboelastography-R 0.5 min, angle 75.5°, MA 64.0 mm, citrated functional fibrinogen-MA 20.7 mm) but also an excessive effect of heparin (citrated kaolin -R 42.7 min, citrated kaolin with heparinase 11.7 min). OUTCOMES: Given the TEG findings indicating an excessive heparin effect, the early withdrawal of ECMO was considered. After an evaluation of the patient's respiratory capacity, withdrawal from V-V ECMO was achieved and then anticoagulation was stopped. The hemorrhagic complications and elevated thrombotic marker levels dramatically decreased. LESSONS: TEG monitoring might be a useful option for managing anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients on V-V ECMO frequently showing a hypercoagulative state and requiring massive doses of heparin, to reduce both hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications.","Nakashima, Ryosuke; Nishihara, Masaaki; Iyonaga, Takeshi; Iwasaka, Sho; Yamamoto, Yuzo; Shono, Yuji; Maki, Jun; Tokuda, Kentaro; Akahoshi, Tomohiko; Higo, Taiki; Kitazono, Takanari; Tsutsui, Hiroyuki",Medicine (Baltimore),87,23

METHODS: This protocol describes the planned processes for implementing community-driven participatory research, using a citizen science method to explore CVD risk perceptions and to develop community-specific advocacy and prevention strategies in the rural and urban SSA settings. Multi-disciplinary research teams in four selected African countries will engage with and train community members living in rural and urban communities as citizen scientists to facilitate conceptualization, co-designing of research, data gathering, and co-creation of knowledge that can lead to a shared agenda to support collaborative participation in community-engaged science. The emphasis is on robust community engagement, using mobile technology to support data gathering, participatory learning, and co-creation of knowledge and disease prevention advocacy.

Since COVID-19 is a new phenomenon with limited information available, it may have adverse psychological effects on pregnant women. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the status of depression, stress, anxiety and their predictors in Iranian pregnant women during the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was performed on 205 pregnant women covered by Tabriz health centers in Iran. The sampling method used was cluster sampling. The data collection tool was the socio-demographic characteristics questionnaire and the DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21), which were completed online by pregnant women. The general linear model was used to determine the predictive factors of depression, anxiety and stress. RESULTS: The mean (SD) score of depression, stress, and anxiety were 3.91 (3.9), 6.22 (4.25), and 3.79 (3.39), respectively; the score range of 0 to 21. Depression, stress, and anxiety symptoms were observed in 32.7, 32.7, and 43.9% of the participants, respectively, with varying degrees from mild to very severe. Based on the adjusted general linear model, variables of education level, spouse’s job and marital life satisfaction were the predictors of depressive symptoms. Variables of spouse’s education level, spouse’s support, marital life satisfaction and the number of pregnancies were the predictive factors of anxiety symptoms and the variables of spouse’s education level, household income sufficiency, spouse’s support and marital life satisfaction were predictors of stress symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the role of marital life satisfaction, high level of spouse’s education and income in reducing symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression in pregnant women in critical situations such as the prevalence of COVID-19, it seems that using strategies to promote marital life satisfaction and socio-economic status can play an effective role in controlling anxiety and reducing stress and depression in pregnant women.","Effati-Daryani, Fatemeh; Zarei, Somayeh; Mohammadi, Azam; Hemmati, Elnaz; Ghasemi Yngyknd, Sakineh; Mirghafourvand, Mojgan",BMC Psychol,87,30

The etiologic agents are Vibrio spp. that carry Photorhabdus Insect-Related (Pir) toxin genes pirA and pirB. A multiplex SYBR Green real-time PCR was developed that detects pirA, pirB, and two internal control genes, the shrimp 18S rRNA and the bacterial 16S rRNA genes in a single reaction. The pirB primers amplify the 3'-end of the pirB gene allowing the detection of Vibrio spp. mutants that contain a complete deletion of pirA and the partial deletion of pirB. The assay also detects mutants that contain the entire pirA gene and the deletion of the pirB gene. Since both toxin genes are needed for disease development, this assays can distinguish between pathogenic strains of Vibrio spp. that cause AHPND in shrimp and mutants that do not cause disease. The amplicons for pirA, pirB, 18S rRNA and 16S rRNA showed easily distinguishable melting temperatures of 78.21 ± 0.18, 75.20 ± 0.20, 82.28 ± 0.34 and 85.41 ± 0.21 °C respectively. Additionally, a duplex real-time PCR assay was carried out by designing TaqMan probes for the pirA and pirB primers. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity was compared between the SYBR Green and TaqMan assays. Both assays showed similar sensitivity with a limit of detection being 10 copies for pirA and pirB, and neither assays showed any cross reaction with other known bacterial and viral pathogens in shrimp. The high sensitivity of both assays make them suitable for the detection of low copies of the pirA and pirB genes in AHPND causing Vibrio spp. as well as for detecting non-pathogenic mutants.","Cruz-Flores, Roberto; Mai, Hung Nam; Dhar, Arun K.",Mol Cell Probes,87,32

Satellite telemetry was used on nine flying-foxes of three species (Pteropus alecto n = 5, P. vampyrus n = 2, and P. neohibernicus n = 2) to determine the scale and pattern of their long-distance movements and their potential to transfer these viruses between countries in the region. The animals were captured and released from six different locations in Australia, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and Timor-Leste. Their movements were recorded for a median of 120 (range, 47–342) days with a median total distance travelled of 393 (range, 76–3011) km per individual. Pteropus alecto individuals were observed to move between Australia and Papua New Guinea (Western Province) on four occasions, between Papua New Guinea (Western Province) and Indonesia (Papua) on ten occasions, and to traverse Torres Strait on two occasions. Pteropus vampyrus was observed to move between Timor-Leste and Indonesia (West Timor) on one occasion. These findings expand upon the current literature on the potential for transfer of zoonotic viruses by flying-foxes between countries and have implications for disease risk management and for the conservation management of flying-fox populations in Australia, New Guinea, and the Lesser Sunda Islands.","Breed, Andrew C.; Field, Hume E.; Smith, Craig S.; Edmonston, Joanne; Meers, Joanne",Ecohealth,87,1

METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured with the Elecsys® assay and the EDI(TM) ELISAs (IgM and IgG) in 64 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients with serial blood samples (n=104) collected at different time points from symptom onset. Blood samples from 200 healthy blood donors and 256 intensive care unit (ICU) patients collected before the COVID-19 outbreak were also used. RESULTS: In COVID-19 patients, the percentage of positive results rose with time from symptom onset, peaking to positivity rates after 15-22 days of 100% for the Elecsys® assay, of 94% for the EDI(TM) IgM-ELISA and of 100% for the EDI(TM) IgG ELISA. In the 104 blood samples, the agreement between positive/negative classifications of the Elecsys® assay and the EDI(TM) ELISAs (IgM or IgG) was 90%. The false positivity rates in the healthy blood donors and the ICU patients were <1% for the Elecsys® assay and <3% for the EDI(TM) ELISAs.

To address this issue, we have analyzed the kinetics of neutralizing antibody responses and their association with disease severity. Between March and May 2020, the prospective KING study enrolled 72 COVID-19+ participants grouped according to disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by serological and virological tests. Plasma neutralizing responses were assessed against replicative virus and pseudoviral particles. Multiple regression and non-parametric tests were used to analyze dependence of parameters. The magnitude of neutralizing titers significantly increased with disease severity. Hospitalized individuals developed higher titers compared to mild-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, which together showed titers below the detection limit in 50% of cases. Longitudinal analysis confirmed the strong differences in neutralizing titers between non-hospitalized and hospitalized participants and showed rapid kinetics of appearance of neutralizing antibodies (50% and 80% of maximal activity reached after 11 and 17 days after symptoms onset, respectively) in hospitalized patients. No significant impact of age, gender or treatment on the neutralizing titers was observed in this limited cohort.

Demographic, behavioural and psychological factors associated with sleep changes were also investigated. An online population survey assessing sleep and mental health was distributed between 3 April and 24 June 2020. Retrospective questions were used to estimate temporal changes from before to during the outbreak. In 5,525 Canadian respondents (67.1% females, 16–95 years old: Mean ± SD = 55.6 ± 16.3 years), wake‐up times were significantly delayed relative to pre‐outbreak estimates (p < .001, [Formula: see text] = 0.04). Occurrences of clinically meaningful sleep difficulties significantly increased from 36.0% before the outbreak to 50.5% during the outbreak (all p < .001, g ≥ 0.27). Three subgroups with distinct profiles of changes in sleep behaviours were identified: “Reduced Time in Bed”, “Delayed Sleep” and “Extended Time in Bed”. The “Reduced Time in Bed” and “Delayed Sleep” subgroups had more adverse sleep outcomes and psychological changes during the outbreak. The emergence of new sleep difficulties was independently associated with female sex, chronic illnesses, being employed, family responsibilities, earlier wake‐up times, higher stress levels, as well as heavier alcohol use and television exposure.

Biological impoverishment, habitat fragmentation, climate change, increasing toxification, and the rapid global movement of people and other living organisms have worked synergistically to diminish ecosystem function. This has resulted in unprecedented levels of disease emergence, driven by human-induced environmental degradation, which poses a threat to the survival and health of biodiversity. The emerging discipline of conservation medicine addresses these concerns through the following entities: humans; global climate; habitat destruction and alteration; biodiversity, including wildlife populations; domestic animals; and pathogens, parasites and pollutants. Furthermore, conservation medicine focuses on explicit linkages between these entities. As a crisis discipline, the usefulness of conservation medicine ultimately will depend on its applicability to solving problems. The perspectives and scientific findings of conservation medicine provide input into biomedical education; and policy and management of ecosystems, habitats and imperiled species. A sentinel species is one that has presented itself, or has been selected, to provide insight into the state (health) of an ecosystem, based on user-defined (e.g., researchers, conservationists or policymakers) objectives (e.g., disease, parasites, toxics, climate change, habitat destruction), coupled with the utility and vulnerability of this species to the perceived stress. The scientific information generated by the sentinel species should empower stakeholders and decision-makers to take mitigative action or support predictive capabilities; the ""utility"" of the species selected should consider its value and relevance to conservationists and to society at large (e.g., education and outreach; social sciences). Wild canids may serve as excellent sentinel species of emerging canine vector-borne diseases. Several canine vector-borne diseases or antibodies to these pathogens have been identified in wild canids including visceral leishmaniosis, Lyme disease, heartworm, hepatozoonosis and anaplasmosis to name a few. These reports are relatively recent as they relate to wildlife-domestic animal interactions, globalisation, translocations, habitat fragmentation and climate change. These pathogens and their relationship to wild canids are described herein. Further research needs to be performed to elucidate the role of the 36 extant species of wild canids in the epidemiology of canine vector-borne diseases.","Aguirre, A Alonso",Parasit Vectors,87,26

This study aims to assess the current cognitive status and the longitudinal cognitive decline in elderly patients recovered from COVID-19. METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited 1539 COVID-19 inpatients aged over 60 years who were discharged from three COVID-19-designated hospitals in Wuhan, China, from February 10 to April 10, 2020. In total, 466 uninfected spouses of COVID-19 patients were selected as controls. The current cognitive status was assessed using a Chinese version of the Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status-40 (TICS-40) and the longitudinal cognitive decline was assessed using an Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). Cognitive assessments were performed 6 months after patient discharge. RESULTS: Compared with controls, COVID-19 patients had lower TICS-40 scores and higher IQCODE scores [TICS-40 median (IQR): 29 (25 to 32) vs. 30 (26 to 33), p < 0.001; IQCODE median (IQR): 3.19 (3.00 to 3.63) vs. 3.06 (3.00 to 3.38), p < 0.001].

We investigate the role of immunization, testing, isolation, mask wearing, and social distancing in the presence of implementation challenges and imperfect compliance. ResultsWe show that while frequent testing can drastically reduce spread if immunity levels are low, its effects are limited if immunity is more ubiquitous. Furthermore, while moderate levels of mask wearing and social distancing can offer additional reductions in cumulative incidence, their benefit declines rapidly as immunity and testing frequency increase. However, if immunity from vaccination is imperfect or declines over time, scenarios not studied here, frequent testing and other interventions may play a more central role. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that while regular testing and isolation are powerful tools, they have limited benefit if immunity is high or other interventions are widely adopted.

Despite the high number of cases, cancer management should remain one of the priorities of healthcare, as any delay would potentially cause disease progression. METHODS: This was an observational study that included nonmetastatic rectal cancer patients managed at the Philippine General Hospital from March 16 to May 31, 2020, coinciding with the lockdown. The treatment received and their outcomes were investigated. RESULTS: Of the 52 patients included, the majority were female (57.7%), belonging to the age group of 50 to 69 years (53.8%), and residing outside the capital (59.6%). On follow-up, 23.1% had no disease progression, 17.3% had local progression, 28.8% had metastatic progression, 19.2% have died, and 11.5% were lost to follow up. The initial plan for 47.6% patients was changed. Of the 21 patients with nonmetastatic disease, 2 underwent outright resection. The remaining 19 required neoadjuvant therapy. Eight have completed their neoadjuvant treatment, 8 are undergoing treatment, 2 had their treatment interrupted, and 1 has yet to begin treatment. Among the 9 patients who completed neoadjuvant therapy, only 1 was able to undergo resection on time. The rest were delayed, with a median time of 4 months. One has repeatedly failed to arrive for her surgery due to public transport limitations. There was 1 adjuvant chemotherapy-related mortality. CONCLUSION: Delays in cancer management resulted in disease progression in several patients. Alternative neoadjuvant treatment options should be considered while taking into account oncologic outcomes, acceptable toxicity, and limitation of potential COVID-19 exposure.","Manlubatan, Sofia Isabel T.; Lopez, Marc Paul J.; Onglao, Mark Augustine S.; Monroy III, Hermogenes J.",Ann Coloproctol,87,10

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of both strategies on severe trauma admissions and ICU capacity in Ile-de-France region (Paris Area). MAIN TEXT: We conducted a multicenter cohort-based observational study from 1(st)January 2017 to 31th December 2020, including all consecutive trauma patients admitted to the trauma centers of Ile-de-France region participating in the national registry (Traumabase®). Two periods were defined, the “non-pandemic period” (NPP) from 2017 to 2019, and the “pandemic period” (PP) concerning those admitted in 2020. The number of ICU beds released during 2020 pandemic period (overall period, SL and ML) was estimated by multiplying difference in trauma admissions by the median length of stay during the same week of pandemic period (ICU day-beds in 2020). A 15% yearly reduction of trauma patients was observed during the PP, associated with the release of 6422 ICU day-beds in 2020. During SL and ML, the observed decrease in trauma admission was respectively 49 and 39% compared with similar dates of the NPP. The number of beds released was 1531 days-beds in SL and 679 day-beds in ML. Those reductions respectively accounted for 4.5 and 6.0% of the overall ICU admission for COVID-19 in Ile-de-France. CONCLUSION: The lockdown strategies during pandemic resulted in a reduction of severe trauma admissions. In addition to the social distancing effect, lockdown strategies freed up an important number of ICU beds in trauma centers, available for severe COVID-19 patients.","Moyer, Jean-Denis; Abback, Paer-Selim; Hamada, Sophie; Martinez, Thibault; Werner, Marie; James, Arthur",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,87,30

Given the high prevalence of obesity in the United States, we hypothesized that the presence of obesity may play a role in the clinical course of COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of adult patients admitted with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2. Demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and clinical outcomes were abstracted. BMI (kg/m(2)) was analyzed with regard to a composite outcome of ICU admission or death, and intubation rate. RESULTS: 770 patients were included (61% male, mean age 63.5 yrs). Obese patients were more likely to present with fever, cough and shortness of breath. Obesity was also associated with a significantly higher rate of ICU admission or death (RR = 1.58, p = 0.002) even after adjusting for age, race and troponin level. CONCLUSIONS: Obese patients had an increased risk of critical illness leading to ICU admission or death compared to normal weight individuals. This study confirms that obesity is a major risk factor for COVID‐19 disease severity, significantly impacting disease presentation and critical care requirements.","Hajifathalian, Kaveh; Kumar, Sonal; Newberry, Carolyn; Shah, Shawn; Fortune, Brett; Krisko, Tibor; Ortiz‐Pujols, Shiara; Zhou, Xi Kathy; Dannenberg, Andrew J; Kumar, Rekha; Sharaiha, Reem Z",Obesity (Silver Spring),87,33

In this study, we develop a measurement method to evaluate the impact of resilience strategies in a multi-stage supply chain (SC) in the presence of a pandemic. For the first time, we propose a method to deduce quantitative resilience assessment from simulation. We implement two resilience strategies, i.e., prepositioning extra-inventory and a backup supplier, and then we simulate its impact on SC resilience and financial performance. The simulation results indicate that the extra inventory leads to a higher resilience than a backup supplier but costs more for the given contextual setting. Finally, we examine the demand fulfillment and observe that the extra-inventory strategy allows for a higher service level, confirming our resilience simulations. We discuss the managerial implications of these findings on the descriptive and predictive analysis levels. Decision-makers can utilize our model and findings to develop a response plan in the occurrence of a pandemic or any long-duration high magnitude disruption. Also, scholars and managers can use our proposed method to measure SC resiliency from simulation in any disruption.","Moosavi, Javid; Hosseini, Seyedmohsen",Comput Ind Eng,87,16

Understanding how these properties relate to each other and vary across epitopes would aid development of antibody therapeutics and guide vaccine design. Here, we comprehensively characterize escape, breadth, and potency across a panel of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD), including S309(4), the parental antibody of the late-stage clinical antibody VIR-7831. We observe a tradeoff between SARS-CoV-2 in vitro neutralization potency and breadth of binding across SARS-related coronaviruses. Nevertheless, we identify several neutralizing antibodies with exceptional breadth and resistance to escape, including a new antibody (S2H97) that binds with high affinity to all SARS-related coronavirus clades via a unique RBD epitope centered on residue E516. S2H97 and other escape-resistant antibodies have high binding affinity and target functionally constrained RBD residues. We find that antibodies targeting the ACE2 receptor binding motif (RBM) typically have poor breadth and are readily escaped by mutations despite high neutralization potency, but we identify one potent RBM antibody (S2E12) with breadth across sarbecoviruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and with a high barrier to viral escape. These data highlight functional diversity among antibodies targeting the RBD and identify epitopes and features to prioritize for antibody and vaccine development against the current and potential future pandemics.","Starr, Tyler N.; Czudnochowski, Nadine; Zatta, Fabrizia; Park, Young-Jun; Liu, Zhuoming; Addetia, Amin; Pinto, Dora; Beltramello, Martina; Hernandez, Patrick; Greaney, Allison J.; Marzi, Roberta; Glass, William G.; Zhang, Ivy; Dingens, Adam S.; Bowen, John E.; Wojcechowskyj, Jason A.; De Marco, Anna; Rosen, Laura E.; Zhou, Jiayi; Montiel-Ruiz, Martin; Kaiser, Hannah; Tucker, Heather; Housley, Michael P.; di Iulio, Julia; Lombardo, Gloria; Agostini, Maria; Sprugasci, Nicole; Culap, Katja; Jaconi, Stefano; Meury, Marcel; Dellota, Exequiel; Cameroni, Elisabetta; Croll, Tristan I.; Nix, Jay C.; Havenar-Daughton, Colin; Telenti, Amalio; Lempp, Florian A.; Pizzuto, Matteo S.; Chodera, John D.; Hebner, Christy M.; Whelan, Sean P.J.; Virgin, Herbert W.; Veesler, David; Corti, Davide; Bloom, Jesse D.; Snell, Gyorgy",bioRxiv,87,17

Primary outcome was endotracheal intubation (ETI) rate. In-hospital mortality, time to ETI, tracheostomy, length of RICU and hospital stay served as secondary outcomes. Risk factors associated to ETI among PP patients were also investigated. Results A total of 114 patients were included, 76 in the SC and 38 in the PP group. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates showed greater effect of PP compared to SC on ETI rate (HR = 0.45 95%CI [0.2-0.9], p = 0.02) even after adjustment for baseline confounders (HR = 0.59 95%CI[0.3-0.94], p = 0.03). After stratification according to non-invasive respiratory support, PP showed greater significant benefit for those on high flow nasal cannulae (HR = 0.34 95%CI[0.12-0.84], p = 0.04). Compared to SC, PP patients also showed a favorable difference in terms of days free from respiratory support, length of RICU and hospital stay while mortality and tracheostomy rate were not significantly different. Conclusions Prone positioning in awake and spontaneously breathing Covid-19 patients is feasible and associated with a reduction of intubation rate, especially in those patients undergoing HFNC. Although our results are intriguing, further randomized controlled trials are needed to answer all the open questions remaining pending about the real efficacy of PP in this setting.","Tonelli, Roberto; Pisani, Lara; Tabbì, Luca; Comellini, Vittoria; Prediletto, Irene; Fantini, Riccardo; Marchioni, Alessandro; Andrisani, Dario; Gozzi, Filippo; Bruzzi, Giulia; Manicardi, Linda; Busani, Stefano; Mussini, Cristina; Castaniere, Ivana; Bassi, Ilaria; Carpano, Marco; Tagariello, Federico; Corsi, Gabriele; d’Amico, Roberto; Girardis, Massimo; Nava, Stefano; Clini, Enrico",Pulmonology,87,16

As primary outcomes, severe disease (need for oxygen therapy via nonrebreather mask or mechanical ventilation) and death were studied. Multivariate binary logistic regression models were performed to study the association between the different factors and the results. RESULTS: Advanced age, male sex and obesity were independent markers of poor prognosis. The most frequent presenting symptom was fever, while dyspnea was associated with severe disease and the presence of cough with greater survival. Low oxygen saturation in the emergency room, elevated CRP in the emergency room and initial radiological involvement were all related to worse prognosis. The presence of eosinophilia (% of eosinophils) was an independent marker of less severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified the most robust markers of poor prognosis for COVID-19.

We address this question by analyzing plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, and from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that, while cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses may be rare, indicating the presence of non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether such low or non-neutralizing antibody response leads to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future. Overall, this study not only addresses a fundamental question regarding antigenicity differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, but also has implications for immunogen design and vaccine development.","Lv, Huibin; Wu, Nicholas C; Tak-Yin Tsang, Owen; Yuan, Meng; Perera, Ranawaka A P M; Leung, Wai Shing; So, Ray T Y; Chun Chan, Jacky Man; Yip, Garrick K; Hong Chik, Thomas Shiu; Wang, Yiquan; Chung Choi, Chris Yau; Lin, Yihan; Ng, Wilson W; Zhao, Jincun; Poon, Leo L M; Peiris, J S Malik; Wilson, Ian A; Mok, Chris K P",Cell reports,87,32

The circulating level of CTSL was elevated after SARS-CoV-2 infection and was positively correlated with disease course and severity. Correspondingly, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection increased CTSL expression in human cells in vitro and human ACE2 transgenic mice in vivo, while CTSL overexpression, in turn, enhanced pseudovirus infection in human cells. CTSL functionally cleaved the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and enhanced virus entry, as evidenced by CTSL overexpression and knockdown in vitro and application of CTSL inhibitor drugs in vivo. Furthermore, amantadine, a licensed anti-influenza drug, significantly inhibited CTSL activity after SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection and prevented infection both in vitro and in vivo.

Vaccinations against FPV among wild felid species have long been practiced in zoos worldwide. However, few studies have assessed the tiger immune response post-vaccination due to the absence of a serological diagnostic tool. To address these limitations, this study aimed to develop an in-house indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the monitoring of tiger antibody levels against the feline panleukopenia vaccine by employing the synthesized subunit capsid protein VP2. An in-house horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated rabbit anti-tiger immunoglobulin G (IgG) polyclonal antibody (HRP-anti-tiger IgG) was produced in this study and employed in the assay. It was then compared to a commercial HRP-conjugated goat anti-cat IgG (HRP-anti-cat IgG). Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated using the Bayesian model with preferential conditional dependence between HRP-conjugated antibody-based ELISAs and hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) tests. RESULTS: The posterior estimates for sensitivity and specificity of two indirect ELISA HRP-conjugated antibodies were higher than those of the HI test. The sensitivity and specificity of the indirect ELISA for HRP-anti-tiger IgG and HRP-anti-cat IgG were 86.5, 57.2 and 86.7%, 64.6%, respectively, while the results of the HI test were 79.1 and 54.1%. In applications, 89.6% (198/221) and 89.1% (197/221) of the tiger serum samples were determined to be seropositive by indirect ELISA testing against HRP-anti-tiger and HRP-anti-cat, respectively. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, the specific serology assays for the detection of the tiger IgG antibody have not yet been established. The HRP-anti-tiger IgG has been produced for the purpose of developing the specific immunoassays for tigers. Remarkably, an in-house indirect ELISA based on VP2 subunit antigen has been successfully developed in this study, providing a potentially valuable serological tool for the effective detection of tiger antibodies.","Areewong, Chanakan; Rittipornlertrak, Amarin; Nambooppha, Boondarika; Fhaikrue, Itsarapan; Singhla, Tawatchai; Sodarat, Chollada; Prachasilchai, Worapat; Vongchan, Preeyanat; Sthitmatee, Nattawooti",BMC Vet Res,87,24

We used structured questionnaires to collect data on biological sex, gender identity (self-endorsement on masculinity and femininity traits), work and family demands, work-to-family conflict (WFC), and family-to-work conflict (FWC). We found two sets of significant three-way interactions (sex × femininity × role demands) in predicting work and family conflict. First, for men, identifying with high femininity traits strengthened the positive relationship between work demands and FWC; for women, identifying with low femininity traits strengthened the same relationship. Second, for men, identifying with high femininity traits strengthened the relationship between family demands and WFC; for women, identifying with low femininity traits strengthened the same relationship. Our findings highlight the importance of jointly examining the biological, psychological, and social aspects of gender on the work and family interface.

We aimed to externally validate a risk prediction algorithm (QCovid) to estimate mortality outcomes from COVID-19 in adults in England. METHODS: We did a population-based cohort study using the UK Office for National Statistics Public Health Linked Data Asset, a cohort of individuals aged 19–100 years, based on the 2011 census and linked to Hospital Episode Statistics, the General Practice Extraction Service data for pandemic planning and research, and radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy records. The primary outcome was time to COVID-19 death, defined as confirmed or suspected COVID-19 death as per death certification. Two periods were used: (1) Jan 24 to April 30, 2020, and (2) May 1 to July 28, 2020. We assessed the performance of the QCovid algorithms using measures of discrimination and calibration. Using predicted 90-day risk of COVID-19 death, we calculated r(2) values, Brier scores, and measures of discrimination and calibration with corresponding 95% CIs over the two time periods. FINDINGS: We included 34 897 648 adults aged 19–100 years resident in England. 26 985 (0·08%) COVID-19 deaths occurred during the first period and 13 177 (0·04%) during the second. The algorithms had good discrimination and calibration in both periods. In the first period, they explained 77·1% (95% CI 76·9–77·4) of the variation in time to death in men and 76·3% (76·0–76·6) in women. The D statistic was 3·761 (3·732–3·789) for men and 3·671 (3·640–3·702) for women and Harrell's C was 0·935 (0·933–0·937) for men and 0·945 (0·943–0·947) for women. Similar results were obtained for the second time period. In the top 5% of patients with the highest predicted risks of death, the sensitivity for identifying deaths in the first period was 65·94% for men and 71·67% for women. INTERPRETATION: The QCovid population-based risk algorithm performed well, showing high levels of discrimination for COVID-19 deaths in men and women for both time periods. QCovid has the potential to be dynamically updated as the pandemic evolves and, therefore, has potential use in guiding national policy.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the acquisition and retention of H9N2 AIV on and within the house fly, Musca domestica (Linnaeus 1758), under laboratory conditions. In first experiment, 100 adult house flies were divided into control and treatment groups equally. Treatment group was fed with a meal containing H9N2 virus, while control group was supplied with an identical meal without virus. Fifteen minutes after exposure in each group, flies were washed twice to remove surface particles, disinfected and then homogenized for testing. The two external body surface washes and the homogenate samples were tested for H9N2 to distinguish exterior from interior viral load. Second experiment was performed likewise but five flies from each group were taken at 0, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h post-exposure. All samples were subjected to real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) for detecting H9-Specific viral RNA. Results of the first experiment showed that viral RNA was detectable in both of external surface and homogenates samples. Second experiment revealed that persistence of H9N2 AIVs on external body surface and within the body of M. domestica were 24 and 96 h, respectively. Moreover, viral RNAs concentration declined during the time after exposure to AIV H9N2 either outside or within house flies. Overall, house fly was able to acquire and preserve H9N2 AIV experimentally, which may contribute the spread of virus among poultry farms.","Salamatian, Iman; Moshaverinia, Ali; Razmyar, Jamshid; Ghaemi, Mehran",J Med Entomol,87,17

The longevity of the crisis, and disruption to normality is unknown. With COVID‐19 set to be a chronic health crisis, clinicians will be required to maintain a state of high alert for an extended period. The support received before and during an incident is likely to influence whether clinicians experience psychological growth or injury. An abundance of information is emerging on disease epidemiology, pathogenesis and infection control prevention. However, literature on interventions for supporting the psychological wellbeing of healthcare workers during disease outbreaks is limited. This article summarises the available management strategies to increase resilience in healthcare workers during the COVID‐19 pandemic and beyond. It focuses on self care and organisational justice. It highlights various individual as well as organisational strategies. With the success of slowing disease spread in many countries to date, and reduced workload due to limitations on elective surgery in many institutions, there is more time and opportunity to be proactive in implementing measures to mitigate or minimise potential adverse psychological effects and improve, restore and preserve the wellbeing of the workforce now and for years to come. The purpose of this review is to review available literature on strategies for minimising the psychological impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on clinicians and to identify proactive holistic approaches which may be beneficial for healthcare workers both for the current crisis and into the future.","Heath, C.; Sommerfield, A.; von Ungern‐Sternberg, B.S.",Anaesthesia,87,1

The validity of most predictive models relies on numerous parameters, involving biological and social characteristics often unknown or highly uncertain. Data of the COVID-19 epidemics in China, Japan, South Korea and Italy were used to build up deterministic models without strong assumptions. These models were then applied to other countries to identify the closest scenarios in order to foresee their coming behaviour. The models enabled to predict situations that were confirmed little by little, proving that these tools can be efficient and useful for decision making in a quickly evolving operational context.","Mangiarotti, S.; Peyre, M.; Zhang, Y.; Huc, M.; Roger, F.; Kerr, Y.",Epidemiol Infect,87,5

This pandemic has not only affected people but also caused economic crisis throughout the world. Researchers have shown good progress in revealing the molecular insights of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and developing vaccines, but effective treatment against SARS-CoV-2-infected patients are yet to be found. Several vaccines are available and used in many countries, while many others are still in clinical or preclinical studies. However, this involves a long-term process, considering the safety procedures and requirements and their long-term protection capacity and in different age groups are still questionable. Therefore, at present, the drug repurposing of the existing therapeutics previously designed against other viral diseases seems to be the only practical approach to mitigate the current situation. The safety of most of these therapeutic agents has already been tested. Recent clinical reports revealed promising therapeutic efficiency of several drugs such as remdesivir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, baricitinib, and cepharanthine. Besides, plasma therapies were used to treat patients and prevent fatal outcomes. Thus, in this article, we have summarized the epidemiological and clinical data from several clinical trials conducted since the beginning of the pandemic, emphasizing the efficiency of the known agents against SARS-CoV-2 and their harmful side effects on the human body as well as their environmental implications.

PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: In recorded semi-structured telephone interviews, the patients answered questions about their quality of life, treatment procedures, their relationship with medical care staff and modern communication technologies. Each interview consisted of 28 questions. The average length of an interview was 30 minutes. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed by means of a qualitative content analysis according to Mayring. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic adds to the burden of patients by decreasing their social contacts. They perceived the new isolation and protective measures in outpatient clinics as mostly positive and said its impact had been only slightly adverse. With the implemented safety measures, they feel adequately protected and looked after and want their antiproliferative therapy to be performed as scheduled. Talking to medical staff provides additional reassurance. CONCLUSION: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the social isolation of tumor patients, it has had only a minor effect on tumor therapy in the surveyed patient population. The benefits of modern communication options to tumor patients remains uncertain and should be investigated further in future studies.","Kaiser, Ulrich; Vehling-Kaiser, Ursula; Schmidt, Jörg; Hoffmann, Ana; Kaiser, Florian",PLoS One,87,33

The potential implications of these findings in athletes are significant given the concern that exercise, during the acute phase of viral myocarditis, may exacerbate myocardial injury and precipitate malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Such concerns have led to the development and publication of expert consensus documents aimed at providing guidance for the evaluation of athletes after contracting COVID-19 in order to permit safe return-to-play. Cardiac imaging is at the center of these evaluations. This review seeks to evaluate the current evidence regarding COVID-19associated cardiovascular disease and how multi-modality imaging may be useful in the screening and clinical evaluation of athletes with suspected cardiovascular complications of infection. Guidance is provided with diagnostic “red flags” that raise the suspicion of pathology. Specific emphasis is placed on the unique challenges posed in distinguishing athletic cardiac remodeling from sub-clinical cardiac disease. The strengths and limitations of different imaging modalities are discussed and an approach to return-to-play decision making for athletes’ post COVID-19, as informed by multi-modality imaging, is provided.","Phelan, Dermot; Kim, Jonathan H.; Elliott, Michael D.; Wasfy, Meagan M.; Cremer, Paul; Johri, Amer M.; Emery, Mike; Sengupta, Partho P.; Sharma, Sanjay; Martinez, Matthew W.; La Gerche, Andre",JACC Cardiovasc Imaging,87,29

However, there is limited literature on the appropriate timing of corticosteroid administration to obtain the best possible patient outcomes. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study including patients with severe COVID-19 who received corticosteroid treatment from March 2 to June 30, 2020 in seven tertiary hospitals in South Korea. We analyzed the patient demographics, characteristics, and clinical outcomes according to the timing of steroid use. Twenty-two patients with severe COVID-19 were enrolled, and they were all treated with corticosteroids. RESULTS: Of the 22 patients who received corticosteroids, 12 patients (55%) were treated within 10 days from diagnosis. There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics. The initial PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio was 168.75. The overall case fatality rate was 25%. The mean time from diagnosis to steroid use was 4.08 days and the treatment duration was 14 days in the early use group, while those in the late use group were 12.80 days and 18.50 days, respectively. The PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, C-reactive protein level, and cycle threshold value improved over time in both groups. In the early use group, the time from onset of symptoms to discharge (32.4 days vs. 60.0 days, P = 0.030), time from diagnosis to discharge (27.8 days vs. 57.4 days, P = 0.024), and hospital stay (26.0 days vs. 53.9 days, P = 0.033) were shortened.

The resulting disease, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019), soon became a pandemic. This study aims to characterize key attributes of the epidemiology of this infection in China. Methods: An age-stratified mathematical model was constructed to describe the transmission dynamics and estimate the age-specific differences in the biological susceptibility to the infection, age-assortativeness in transmission mixing, case fatality rate (CFR), and transition in rate of infectious contacts (and reproduction number R0) following introduction of mass interventions. Results: The model estimated the infectious contact rate in early epidemic at 0.59 contacts per day (95% uncertainty interval (UI)=0.48-0.71). Relative to those 60-69 years of age, susceptibility to the infection was only 0.06 in those ≤19 years, 0.34 in 20-29 years, 0.57 in 30-39 years, 0.69 in 40-49 years, 0.79 in 50-59 years, 0.94 in 70-79 years, and 0.88 in ≥80 years. The assortativeness in transmission mixing by age was very limited at 0.004 (95% UI=0.002-0.008). Final CFR was 5.1% (95% UI=4.8-5.4%). R0 rapidly declined from 2.1 (95% UI=1.8-2.4) to 0.06 (95% UI=0.05-0.07) following onset of interventions. Conclusion: Age appears to be a principal factor in explaining the patterns of COVID-19 transmission dynamics in China. The biological susceptibility to the infection seems limited among children, intermediate among young to mid-age adults, but high among those >50 years of age. There was no evidence for differential contact mixing by age, consistent with most transmission occurring in households rather than in schools or workplaces.","Ayoub, Houssein H; Chemaitelly, Hiam; Mumtaz, Ghina R; Seedat, Shaheen; Awad, Susanne F; Makhoul, Monia; Abu-Raddad, Laith J",,87,32

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, but the clinical benefit of HCQ in treating COVID-19 is unclear. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of HCQ for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of HCQ among patients hospitalized with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to HCQ or placebo for five days and followed for 30 days. The primary efficacy outcome was a severe disease progression composite endpoint (death, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, ECMO, and/or vasopressor use) at day 14. RESULTS: A total of 128 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Baseline demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were similar between HCQ (N=67) and placebo (N=61) arms. At day 14, 11 (16.4%) subjects assigned to HCQ and 6 (9.8%) subjects assigned to placebo met the severe disease progression endpoint, but this did not achieve statistical significance (P=.350). There were no significant differences in COVID-19 clinical scores, number of oxygen-free days, SARS-CoV-2 clearance, or adverse events between HCQ and placebo. HCQ was associated with a slight increase in mean corrected QT interval, an increased D-dimer, and a trend towards an increased length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, our data suggest that HCQ does not prevent severe outcomes or improve clinical scores. However, our conclusions are limited by a relatively small sample size, and larger randomized controlled trials or pooled analyses are needed.","Ulrich, Robert J; Troxel, Andrea B; Carmody, Ellie; Eapen, Jaishvi; Bäcker, Martin; DeHovitz, Jack A; Prasad, Prithiv J; Li, Yi; Delgado, Camila; Jrada, Morris; Robbins, Gabriel A; Henderson, Brooklyn; Hrycko, Alexander; Delpachitra, Dinuli; Raabe, Vanessa; Austrian, Jonathan S; Dubrovskaya, Yanina; Mulligan, Mark J",Open Forum Infect Dis,87,3

Cigarette smoke (CS) exposure worsens influenza infection in terms of frequency and severity in both human and animal models. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice with or without CS exposure for 6 weeks were inoculated intranasally with a single, non-lethal dose of the influenza A virus (IAV) A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) strain. At 7 and 10 days after infection, lung and mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) cells were collected to determine the numbers of total CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, and IAV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, using flow cytometry. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was also collected to determine IFN-γ levels and total protein concentration. RESULTS: Although long-term CS exposure suppressed early pulmonary IAV-antigen specific CD8 + and CD4 + T cell numbers and IFN-γ production in response to IAV infection on day 7 post-infection, CS enhanced numbers of these cells and IFN-γ production on day 10. The changes of total protein concentration in BALF are consistent with the changes in the IFN-γ amounts between day 7 and 10, which suggested that excessive IFN-γ impaired barrier function and caused lung injury at the later stage of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that prior CS exposure caused a biphasic T cell and IFN-γ response to subsequent infection with influenza in the lung. Specifically, the number of IAV antigen-specific T cells on day 10 was greatly increased by CS exposure even though CS decreased the number of the same group of cells on day 7. The result suggested that CS affected the kinetics of the T cell response to IAV, which was suppressed at an early stage and exaggerated at a later stage. This study is the first to describe the different effect of long-term CS on T cell responses to IAV at early and late stages of infection in vivo.

Confirmatory testing was completed on 4,094 (96%) of the screen reactive with an overall seroprevalence rate of 0.60% (95% CI: 0.52% to 0.69%). Significant variation in seroprevalence was observed by region of the country and age group. Conclusions The seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies through August 8, 2020 was found to be lower than previously reported in other health care organizations. There was an observation that seroprevalence may be associated with community disease burden.","Carter, Rickey E.; Theel, Elitza S.; Breeher, Laura E.; Swift, Melanie D.; Van Brunt, Nathan A.; Smith, Windell R.; Blanchfield, Lorrie L.; Daugherty, Elizabeth A.; Chapital, Alyssa B.; Matson, Kathleen M.; Bews, Katherine A.; Johnson, Patrick W.; Domnick, Robert A.; Joyce, Diane E.; Geyer, Holly L.; Granger, Dane; Hilgart, Heather R.; Turgeon, Coleman T.; Sanders, Karen A.; Matern, Dietrich; Nassar, Aziza; Sampathkumar, Priya; Hainy, Caitlin M.; Orford, Robert R.; Vachon, Celine M.; Didehban, Roshanak; Morice, William G.; Ting, Henry H.; Williams, Amy W.; Gray, Richard J.; Thielen, Kent R.; Farrugia, Gianrico",Mayo Clin Proc,87,24

A subset of data from an international mixed methods online survey study was analysed to elucidate the findings from Brazil. An online survey, conducted between April and June 2020, gathered closed and open text views from parents of children aged 7-12 years old. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative open text data were analysed using the three stages of the Bardin content analysis framework: pre-analysis (data organisation and initial full-content reading); exploration of the material (thematic coding to identify major motifs and develop thematic categories) and interpretation (treating the data as significant and valid). The sample consisted of 112 (89%) mothers and 14 (11%) fathers. The analysis of the parents open text resulted in two categories: 'How parents share information with their children about COVID-19' and 'How parents limit information to their children about COVID-19'. Some parents reported adopting an honest and open approach on how they shared information with their children, whilst some parents chose to minimise their child's access to information about the pandemic over concerns of the mortality related to COVID-19.","Garcia de Avila, Marla A; Carter, Bernie; Blake, Lucy; Saron, Holly; Kirton, Jennifer; Protheroe, Joanne; Novaes, Dayane C; Alencar, Rúbia A; Fernandes Teixeira, Tatiane R; Bray, Lucy",J Child Health Care,87,22

While the latter pulls her toward a more problem resolution stance, the former pulls her toward a more accepting position. As a result, her therapy is shaped in such a way that she tends to raise more questions instead of providing answers.","Lee, Wai‐Yung",Fam Process,87,1

It is well established that the endothelial glycocalyx-degrading enzyme heparanase contributes to vascular leakage and inflammation. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) serve as an inhibitor of heparanase. We hypothesize that heparanase contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and that heparanase may be inhibited by LMWH. To test this hypothesis, heparanase activity and heparan sulfate levels were measured in plasma of healthy controls (n = 10) and COVID-19 patients (n = 48). Plasma heparanase activity and heparan sulfate levels were significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients. Heparanase activity was associated with disease severity including the need for intensive care, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and creatinine levels. Use of prophylactic LMWH in non-ICU patients was associated with a reduced heparanase activity. Since there is no other clinically applied heparanase inhibitor currently available, therapeutic treatment of COVID-19 patients with low molecular weight heparins should be explored.","Buijsers, Baranca; Yanginlar, Cansu; de Nooijer, Aline; Grondman, Inge; Maciej-Hulme, Marissa L.; Jonkman, Inge; Janssen, Nico A.

BACKGROUND High mortality rates were reported for surgical patients with COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic. However, the indirect impact of the pandemic on this cohort is not understood, and risk predictors are yet to be identified. METHODS PREDICT is an international longitudinal cohort study comprising surgical patients presenting to hospital between March and August 2020, conducted alongside a survey of staff redeployment and departmental restructuring. A subgroup analysis of 3176 adult emergency patients, recruited by 55 teams across 18 countries is presented. RESULTS Among adult emergency surgical patients, all-cause in-hospital mortality (IHM) was 3 6%, compared to 15 5% for those with COVID-19. However, only 14 1% received a COVID-19 test on admission in March, increasing to 76 5% by July.Higher Clinical Frailty Scale scores (CFS >7 aOR 18 87), ASA grade above 2 (aOR 4 29), and COVID-19 infection (aOR 5 12) were independently associated with significantly increased IHM.The peak months of the first wave were independently associated with significantly higher IHM (March aOR 4 34; April aOR 4 25; May aOR 3 97), compared to non-peak months.During the study, UK operating theatre capacity decreased by a mean of 63 6% with a concomitant 27 3% reduction in surgical staffing. CONCLUSION The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted surgical patients, both directly through co-morbid infection and indirectly as shown by increasing mortality in peak months, irrespective of COVID-19 status.Higher CFS scores and ASA grades strongly predict outcomes in surgical patients and are an important risk assessment tool during the pandemic.","Beatty, Jasmine Winter; Clarke, Jonathan M; Sounderajah, Viknesh; Acharya, Amish; Rabinowicz, Simon; Martin, Guy; Warren, Leigh R; Yalamanchili, Seema; Scott, Alasdair J; Burgnon, Elizabeth; Purkayastha, Sanjay; Markar, Sheraz; Kinross, James M",Annals of surgery,87,29
