Patients can be affected following immune activation after an oncologic, autoimmune or infectious trigger. An associated gene mutation may be found which impairs cytolytic lymphocyte function. We describe a pediatric case of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis with a novel mutation of MUNC 13–4 whose diagnosis was confounded by concurrent immunosuppression. Clinical reassessment for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is necessary in persistently febrile patients with laboratory derangements in the setting of immunosuppressive agent exposure.","Garrett, Jackie P-D; Fung, Irene; Rupon, Jeremy; Knight, Andrea; Mizesko, Melissa; Paessler, Michelle; Orange, Jordan S",Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,255,1

On the other hand, excessive and inappropriate NO synthesis in inflammation and sepsis has been implicated in vascular abnormalities and cell injury. At least three different NOS isoforms (neuronal/brain [bNOS], inducible [iNOS], and endothelial [eNOS]) have been described, which are all expressed in normal lung tissue. We investigated the cell-specific expression of bNOS, iNOS, and eNOS in perfused control rat lungs and lungs undergoing stimulation with endotoxin in the presence and absence of plasma constituents. Lung immunohistochemistry and quantitative evaluation of staining intensity showed endotoxin-induced increase in iNOS expression in particular in bronchial epithelial cells, cells of the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), alveolar macrophages, and vascular smooth muscle cells in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. In endothelial cells, which did not express iNOS at baseline, newly induced iNOS was found in response to endotoxin. In contrast, expression of eNOS was markedly suppressed under endotoxin challenge, particularly in bronchial epithelium, BALT, and alveolar macrophages but also in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. eNOS expression in bronchial smooth muscle cells was not altered. In contrast to iNOS and eNOS, cellular expression of bNOS in epithelial cells, nerve fibers, BALT, and endothelial cells did not change in response to endotoxin. All changes in NOS regulation were found to be independent of plasma constituents. We conclude that endotoxin exerts a profound impact on the cell-specific NOS regulation in a large number of lung cell types. Prominent features include de novo synthesis or up-regulation of iNOS, in contrast to down-regulation of eNOS, which may well contribute to vascular abnormalities, inflammatory sequelae, and loss of physiologic functions in septic lung failure.","Ermert, Monika; Ruppert, Clemens; Günther, Andreas; Duncker, Hans-Rainer; Seeger, Werner; Ermert, Leander",Lab Invest,255,8
8375,8375,8375,The etiology of idiopathic parkinsonism,16.082453,7.107559,1999-11-01,"We evaluated the usefulness of a serum Aspergillus PCR assay for the diagnosis and prognosis of invasive aspergillosis in a study involving 941 patients for a total of 5146 serum samples. Fifty-one patients had proven/probable aspergillosis. We compared galactomannan (GM), PCR and mycologic analysis of pulmonary samples in both neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients. PCR performed in serum yielded 66.7% sensitivity, 98.7% specificity, 75.6% positive predictive value and 98.0% negative predictive value, while the GM index yielded 78.4% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity, 27% positive predictive value and 98.6% negative predictive value. The inclusion of PCR in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the Mycosis Study Group (MSG) mycologic criteria permitted the reclassification of nine other cases from possible to probable aspergillosis and increased the sensitivity to 71.7%. Combining the GM index with serum PCR increased the detection rate of invasive aspergillosis with 88.2% sensitivity. PCR was systematically negative in 16 patients with noninvasive forms of aspergillosis (namely aspergilloma and chronic aspergillosis). Remaining PCR positive after a period of 14 to 20 days of treatment was related to poor outcome at 30 and 90 days. Our results also indicate that, unlike the determination of the GM index, the initial fungus load as determined by PCR was highly predictive of 90-day mortality, with the rate of the latter being 15.8% for patients with <150 copies/mL vs. 73.2% for patients at or above that cutoff (p <0.0001). Therefore, PCR appears to be a powerful and interesting tool for the identification of patients with invasive aspergillosis who might benefit from more intense care.","Imbert, S.; Gauthier, L.; Joly, I.; Brossas, J.-Y.; Uzunov, M.; Touafek, F.; Brun, S.; Mazier, D.; Datry, A.; Gay, F.; Fekkar, A.",Clin Microbiol Infect,255,1

Differential expression profiles of miRNAs across a range of diseases have emerged as powerful biomarkers, making a reliable yet rapid profiling technique for miRNAs potentially essential in clinics. Here, we report an amplification-free multi-color single-molecule imaging technique that can profile purified endogenous miRNAs with high sensitivity, specificity, and reliability. Compared to previously reported techniques, our technique can discriminate single base mismatches and single-nucleotide 3′-tailing with low false positive rates regardless of their positions on miRNA. By preloading probes in Thermus thermophilus Argonaute (TtAgo), miRNAs detection speed is accelerated by more than 20 times. Finally, by utilizing the well-conserved linearity between single-molecule spot numbers and the target miRNA concentrations, the absolute average copy numbers of endogenous miRNA species in a single cell can be estimated. Thus our technique, Ago-FISH (Argonaute-based Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization), provides a reliable way to accurately profile various endogenous miRNAs on a single miRNA sensing chip.","Shin, Soochul; Jung, Yoonseok; Uhm, Heesoo; Song, Minseok; Son, Soomin; Goo, Jiyoung; Jeong, Cherlhyun; Song, Ji-Joon; Kim, V.

The mortality rate for emergency groin hernia repair in developed countries is 1.7–7.0% and can rise to 6–25% if bowel resection is needed. In this present analysis of data from the Herniamed Registry, patients with emergency admission and operation within 24 h are analyzed. Methods: Between 2010 and 2019 a total of 13,028 patients with emergency admission and groin hernia repairs within 24 h were enrolled in the Herniamed Registry. The outcome results were assigned to the year of repair and summarized as curves. The total patient collective is broken down into the subgroups with pre-operative manual reduction (taxis) of the hernia content, operative reduction of the hernia content without bowel resection and with bowel resection. The explorative Fisher's exact test was used for statistical assessment of significant differences with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing. Results: The proportion of emergency admissions with groin hernia repair within 24 h was 2.7%. The percentage of women across the years was consistently 33%. The part of femoral hernias was 16%. The proportion of patients with pre-operative reduction (taxis) remained unchanged at around 21% and the share needing bowel resection was around 10%. The proportion of TAPP repairs rose from 21.9% in 2013 to 38.0% in 2019 (p < 0.001). Between the three groups with pre-operative taxis, without bowel resection and with bowel resection, highly significant differences were identified between the patients with regard to the rates of post-operative complications (4% vs. 6.5% vs. 22.7%; p < 0.0001), complication-related reoperations (1.9% vs. 3.8% vs. 17.7%; p < 0.0001), and mortality rate (0.3% vs. 0.9% vs. 7.5%; p < 0.001). In addition to emergency groin hernia repair subgroups female gender and age ≥66 years are unfavorable influencing factors for perioperative outcomes. Conclusion: For patients with emergency groin hernia repair the need for surgical reduction or bowel resection, female gender and age ≥66 years have a highly significantly unfavorable influence on the perioperative outcomes.","Köckerling, Ferdinand; Heine, Till; Adolf, Daniela; Zarras, Konstaninos; Weyhe, Dirk; Lammers, Bernhard; Mayer, Franz; Reinpold, Wolfgang; Jacob, Dietmar",Front Surg,255,1

To manage these challenges, mobile apps may represent a cost-effective and low-threshold approach to support older adults. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the quality, characteristics, as well as privacy and security measures of mobile apps for older adults in the European commercial app stores. METHODS: In the European Google Play and App Store, a web crawler systematically searched for mobile apps for older adults. The identified mobile apps were evaluated by two independent reviewers using the German version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale. A correlation between the user star rating and overall rating was calculated. An exploratory regression analysis was conducted to determine whether the obligation to pay fees predicted overall quality. RESULTS: In total, 83 of 1217 identified mobile apps were included in the analysis. Generally, the mobile apps for older adults were of moderate quality (mean 3.22 [SD 0.68]). Four mobile apps (5%) were evidence-based; 49% (41/83) had no security measures. The user star rating correlated significantly positively with the overall rating (r=.30, P=.01).

We investigate the spatial heterogeneity of the outbreak among districts in Sierra Leone. The stochastic discrete-time susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model is used, allowing for probabilistic movements from one compartment to another. Our model accounts for heterogeneity among districts by making use of a hierarchical approach. The transmission rates are considered time-varying. It is investigated whether or not incubation period, infectious period and transmission rates are different among districts. Estimation is done using the Bayesian formalism. The posterior estimates of the effective reproductive number were substantially different across the districts, with pronounced variability in districts with few cases of Ebola. The posterior estimates of the reproductive number at the district level varied between below 1.0 and 4.5, whereas at nationwide level it varied between below 1.0 and 2.5. The posterior estimate of the effective reproductive number reached a value below 1.0 around December. In some districts, the effective reproductive number pointed out for the persistence of the outbreak or for a likely resurgence of new cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD). The posterior estimates have shown to be highly sensitive to prior elicitation, mainly the incubation period and infectious period.","Muleia, Rachid; Aerts, Marc; Faes, Christel",PLoS One,255,1

The various global trials have suggested that ACEIs and ARBs may increase risk of lung cancer; however, the results are contradictory and there is no local study available. This study is conducted to compare the incidence of lung cancers in patients on ACEIs and ARBs. Methods: This retrospective study, conducted in a major cardiology unit of a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan, included patients diagnosed with hypertension, between 2005 and 2010, who were prescribed either ACEIs or ARBs. During the period of 2005 to 2010, 47,823 naïve hypertensive patients were reported in the outpatient department of the cardiology unit. Of which, 22,241 were prescribed ACEI and 25,582 were prescribed ARBs. After sorting patient data based on our inclusion criteria, n = 14,891 participants were included in the ACEI group and n = 19,112 participants were included in the ARB group. Results: The incidence of lung cancer in the ACEI and ARB group was n = 165 and n = 160, respectively. In this study, the overall incidence rates of lung cancer in the ACEI and ARB cohorts were 12.2 and 16.6 per 10,000 person-years, respectively. The hazard ratio was 1.32 (95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.64; p-value: 0.01). Conclusion: In this study, the incidence of lung cancer was relatively more among people using ACEIs than ARBs. Hence, patients undergoing long-term treatment with ACEIs need regular follow-up and proper scanning to avoid grave complications.","Kumar, Pardeep; Kumar, Vinod; Murlidhar, FNU; Fatima, Aliya; Jahangir, Maha; Khalid, Dua; Memon, Muhammad Khizar; Memon, Sidra; Kumar, Besham",,255,17

It can be seen from previous researches, the DL model formation used only a single frequency sampling of the specific device. Besides, each electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition dataset produces a different length and sampling frequency to ensure sufficient precision of the R–R intervals to determine the heart rate variability (HRV). An accurate HRV is the gold standard for predicting the AF condition; therefore, a current challenge is to determine whether a DL approach can be used to analyze raw ECG data in a broad range of devices. This paper demonstrates powerful results for end-to-end implementation of AF detection based on a convolutional neural network (AFibNet). The method used a single learning system without considering the variety of signal lengths and frequency samplings. For implementation, the AFibNet is processed with a computational cloud-based DL approach. This study utilized a one-dimension convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs) model for 11,842 subjects. It was trained and validated with 8232 records based on three datasets and tested with 3610 records based on eight datasets. The predicted results, when compared with the diagnosis results indicated by human practitioners, showed a 99.80% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. RESULT: Meanwhile, when tested using unseen data, the AF detection reaches 98.94% accuracy, 98.97% sensitivity, and 98.97% specificity at a sample period of 0.02 seconds using the DL Cloud System. To improve the confidence of the AFibNet model, it also validated with 18 arrhythmias condition defined as Non-AF-class. Thus, the data is increased from 11,842 to 26,349 instances for three-class, i.e., Normal sinus (N), AF and Non-AF. The result found 96.36% accuracy, 93.65% sensitivity, and 96.92% specificity.

METHODS: All patients underwent mitral valve (MV) replacement and concomitant bi-atrial cut-and-sew Maze procedure along with other cardiac surgical procedures were recruited from the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery at the First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College of Xi'an Jiaotong University. According to the severity of tricuspid regurgitation, all patients were divided into mild tricuspid regurgitation group and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation group. The general clinical data, biochemical indexes, intraoperative and postoperative data were collected. The relationship between tricuspid regurgitation and sinus bradycardia after the Maze procedure was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: We enrolled 82 patients, including 24 males and 58 females. The patients had an average age of 56 ± 10 years old. There were 50 cases in mild tricuspid regurgitation group and 32 cases in moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation group. Compared with the mild tricuspid regurgitation group, postoperative bradyarrhythmia (41% vs. 14%), pre-discharge bradyarrhythmia (63% vs. 14%), postoperative sinus bradycardia (34% vs. 10%) and pre-discharge sinus bradycardia (63% vs. 10%) in moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation group were significantly increased (P < 0.01). In moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, the risk of sinus bradycardia increased after the Maze procedure (OR = 1.453, 95% CI 1.127–1.874), area under ROC curve was 0.81, the Jordan index was 0.665. CONCLUSION: The severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be an important factor affecting sinus bradycardia after the Maze procedure.

This calls for systematic physical activity (PA) surveillance as a mechanism for assessing the problem and evaluating the effectiveness of related policies. Because countries tend to design their policy measures based on national surveillance data, here we present an inventory of existing national surveillance systems on PA, sedentary behaviour (SB) and sport participation (SP) among adult population in all European Union (EU) Member States. METHODS: As a part of the European Physical Activity and Sports Monitoring System (EUPASMOS) project, a questionnaire was constructed in the form of an on-line survey to collect detailed information on existing national surveillance systems on either PA, SB, or SP. National HEPA focal points from all 27 EU Member States were invited to answer the on-line questionnaire and data collection took part in the period May 2018–September 2019. RESULTS: National monitoring of PA or SB or SP for adults has been established in 16/27 EU Member States, that host 33 different PA/SB/SP monitoring systems. Apart from 3 countries that are using accelerometers (Finland, Ireland and Portugal), surveillance is typically based on questionnaires. In most Member States these questionnaires have not been validated in the particular language and cultural setting. Next, specific domains and dimensions of PA, SB and SP assessed vary a lot across countries. Only 3 countries (the Netherlands, Portugal and Slovenia) are monitoring all three behaviours while covering most of the domains and dimensions of PA/SB/SP. Lastly, as half of the existing surveillance systems set an upper age limit, in 9/16 countries that are monitoring PA/SB/SP, no data for people older than 80 years are available. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic surveillance of PA is lacking among 11/27 EU countries, with even few monitoring SB and SP. Besides, existing surveillance systems typically fail to assess all dimensions and domains of PA/SB/SP with only three countries maintaining monitoring systems that encompass all three behaviours while covering most of the domains and dimensions of PA/SB/SP. Hence, additional efforts in advocacy of systematic PA surveillance in the EU are called for.","Sorić, Maroje; Meh, Kaja; Rocha, Paulo; Wendel-Vos, Wanda; de Hollander, Ellen; Jurak, Gregor",BMC Public Health,255,17

Adopting experimental manipulation of the regime type and the cultural identity of the partner country on nationally representative survey data from two emerging market countries, Turkey and Greece, I demonstrate that while cultural affiliation does not condition individual attitudes, respondents in both samples display a highly significant preference for trade liberalization with a democratic country over an authoritarian one. Assessments based on respondents’ endorsement of postmaterialist values, international trade attitudes, and interpersonal trust reveal that while the democracy preference of Turkish respondents are likely affected by functional reasons, both functional and normative dynamics condition Greek attitudes.

These are: Lesson 1. The power of complex mindsets about education reform. The six reforms all reflect reliance on the worldviews presented in the five frames of reform: cultural, psychological, professional, institutional and political. Those that have been sustained relied on insights from more of these five frames than those that were short lived. Lesson 2. Implementation matters considerably. The chapter discusses how the implementation process in effect recreates a reform, and how the development of an operational strategy defining the details of reform is what in the end most matters to the success of reform. The chapter discusses how the six reforms produced rather distinct operational strategies of seemingly similar components of the reform such as the learning goals for students or teacher professional development. Implementation strategies are also based on implicit theories of how organizations work, and the chapter explains the usefulness of a developmental theory of how organizations evolve to designing strategies that are aligned with the functionings that are possible in a given developmental stage, while also helping the organization evolve towards higher levels of functioning. Lesson 3. The need for operational clarity. People can’t execute what they don’t understand, and a reform must be able to translate goals into clear objectives and reform components into clear tasks which can be widely communicated and understood, as well as tracked to discern improvement and course correct when necessary. Lesson 4. Large scale reform is a journey: Coherence, Completeness and the Five Frames. The chapter explains how using the five dimensional theory of educational change can support coherence and completeness in a reform. Lesson 5. Sequencing, pacing and the importance of first steps. An operational strategy needs to be sequenced attending to ambition of goals, to existing levels of capacity and to institutional stage of development of the system. The first steps in the sequence are consequential because they shape the narrative of reform in ways that have long lasting consequences. Lesson 6. Staying the course. Long policy cycles are essential for reforms to be implemented and to produce results, and those cannot be taken for granted. Coherence, communication and participation can garner support that sustains a reform over time. Lesson 7. Learning from experience to build system level capacity. Most important to the coherent implementation of a reform is to create opportunities for key stakeholders, at various levels of the system, to learn together as a result of implementing components of the reform. Creating feedback loops and processes for making sense of such information is critical to support such learning.","Reimers, Fernando M.",Implementing Deeper Learning and 21st Education Reforms,255,16

As education leaders developed strategies to continue to educate during the Pandemic, through alternative education arrangements necessitated by the closure of schools, the question of re-prioritizing curriculum became essential. In addition, the anticipated disruptions and impacts that the Pandemic would cause brought the question of what capacities matter to the fore. This chapter reviews the history of mass education and examines the role of the United Nations and other international organizations advocating for schools to educate the whole child and to cultivate the breath of skills essential to advance individual freedoms and social improvement. The chapter makes the case that the aspiration to cultivate a broad range of competencies is not only necessary to meet the growing demands of civic and economic participation, but also critical to close opportunity gaps. The development of a science of implementation of system level reform to educate the whole child is fundamental to close the growing gap between more ambitious aspirations for schools and the learning opportunities that most children experience and that are at the root of their low levels of knowledge and skills as demonstrated in international comparative assessments. Implementation strategies need to take into account the stage of institutional development of the education system, and align the components and sequence of the reform to the existing capacities and structures, while using the reform to help the system advance towards more complex forms of organization that enable it to achieve more ambitious goals. The chapter makes the case for examining the implementation of large scale reforms in countries at varied stages of educational development in order to overcome the limitations of the current knowledge base that relies excessively on the study of a narrow range of countries at similar levels of development, many of them with stagnant or declining performance of their students in international assessments of knowledge and skills. Effective implementation requires also coherence across the various levels of governance of the education system and good communication and collaboration across a wide spectrum of stakeholders. Such communication can be facilitated by a good theory of mind of how others view reform. A reform can be viewed through five alternative frameworks: cultural, psychological, professional, institutional and political, or through a combination of those, and each reform is based on elements reflecting one or several of those frames. Understanding these frames, can help better understand how others view change, thus facilitating communication and the development of a shared theory of change. The chapter concludes describing the methods of this study and introducing the six large scale reforms examined in the book.","Reimers, Fernando M.",Implementing Deeper Learning and 21st Education Reforms,255,16

Various imaging features were identified by chest CT with different patterns from early disease to diffuse disease with complications. However, CT cannot be performed for all patients. The arterial oxygen partial pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) ratio is evaluated as a rapid and widely available test for the preliminary assessment of disease severity. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and chest CT imaging features of COVID-19 in Egyptian patients as well as assess the correlation between the chest CT total severity score and the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio to determine its value for preliminary assessment of disease severity. RESULTS: The most common symptoms were fever (83.2%), dry cough (77%), malaise (68.8%), prolonged headaches (48.5%), and dyspnea (37.6%). CT was positive in 79.2% of the patients. The CT features at presentation were ground-glass opacities only (40%), ground-glass opacities with consolidation (34.4%), and consolidation only (25.6%). Associated findings included crazy paving (17.5%), interlobular septal thickening (47.5%), air bronchogram (15%), bronchiectasis (12.8%), fibrous bands (8.1%), vascular enlargement within the lesion (45.6%), nodules (6.8%), pericardial thickening (5%), and pleural thickening (24.7%). The lesions were typically multilobar (50.5%), posterior (58.1%) with peripheral and central distribution (41.9%). Moderate negative correlation was observed between the CT total lung severity score and PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio with r = − 0.42 and P < 0.001. CONCLUSION: The most common pattern of COVID-19 pneumonia in multiple quarantine hospitals was peripheral and central ground-glass opacities with bilateral multilobe posterior involvement and fever was the most common symptom. PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio has a moderate negative correlation with the CT total severity score and thus can be used in the preliminary assessment of disease severity.","Attia, Noha M.; Othman, Moustafa H.

It does so by considering a specific simple rule which was explicitly designed for complex world. A basic idea in Epstein’s book is that the more complex is the world the better is the case for simple rules. To show this, he develops six simple rules pertaining to the rights of individuals, first possession, contracts, torts, government eminent domain and the power of taxation to provide public goods. This paper considers one rule rather than six rules, and it looks at monetary policy rather than policy in general. While the context is different, the case for simple rules made here provides a useful comparison with the case made by Epstein.","Taylor, John B.",Eur J Law Econ,255,3

The study included 16 healthy volunteers and 38 patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation (VE) after a traumatic brain injury, anoxic brain damage, and cerebrovascular events. The external respiration variables were assessed from the initial level to the development of the first episode of desaturation with spO(2) in the range of 90–80% against the background of normobaric hypoxia as indicators reflecting the development of adaptive ventilatory response and characterizing the state of peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity (PCS). The peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity index (PCSI) was calculated using the equation: PCSI = [RR(e) : RR(i)] × [Vt(e) : Vt(i)] × [VE(e) : VE(i)] × Vt(e) × VE(e), where PCSI is the peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity index in L(2)/min; RR(i) and RR(e); Vt(i) and Vt(e); VE(i) and VE(e) are the respiratory rate, tidal volume, minute ventilation initially (i), before a functional stress test, and during a functional test of normobaric hypoxia with spO(2) in the range of 90–80% (e). With the PCSI values ≥15.6 L(2)/min, successful weaning from ventilators and recovery of spontaneous breathing are predicted. The sensitivity and specificity of PCSI were 78.57 [95% CI: 49.2–95.26] and 83.3% [95% CI: 62.6–95.26], respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the traditional indicator of the success rate of weaning from ventilators and recovery of spontaneous breathing, Rapid Shallow Breathing Index (RSBI), in this cohort of patients was 69.23 [95% CI: 38.6–90.9] and 28.0% [95% CI: 12.03–49.3], respectively. A predictor of the patient’s weaning from mechanical ventilation is the assessment of peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity, which can be measured by a simple non-invasive bedside test based on measuring the difference in external ventilation parameters before and during a functional normobaric hypoxic trial.","Kiryachkov, Yu.

Three main requirements become apparent: the need for a clear delimitation of the boundaries of the ecosystem in question, the provision and maintenance of knowledge and capacities within the ecosystem, and the need for adaptable, flexible and careful governance structures that are capable of reacting to environmental changes. Based on these requirements, the chapter then spells out some recommendations for interventions that are likely to be able to shape AI ecosystems in ways that are conducive to human flourishing.","Stahl, Bernd Carsten",Artificial Intelligence for a Better Future,255,7

Telepsychiatry has emerged as a potential solution to this and is now being used across the UK to diagnose and manage mental health conditions. Evidence has shown that its effectiveness is comparable to face to face consultations, however, is much less clear regarding patient satisfaction. We therefore initiated a systematic review to establish whether patients are satisfied with tele-delivery of psychiatric care, and to identify the predictors of a positive experience with telepsychiatry. METHODS: A preliminary search was performed using five databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO), with a date restriction between 2010-2020 to reflect advances in technology over the past decade. RESULTS: Preliminary data shows that patient views on telepsychiatric services are largely positive. Factors that arose in literature potentially affecting this include location, cost, privacy, digital literacy and technological issues including audio/video quality. CONCLUSION: Our study so far shows that patient views on telepsychiatry are generally positive. The review is still in process, however, we anticipate that it will only further support our preliminary findings. These findings will be used to improve patient-centred delivery and provision of telepsychiatric services. We intend to produce a checklist of factors affecting patient satisfaction and test this in a national multicentre study. We are hoping that the study results and the resulting checklist will encourage greater patient involvement in setting up and delivering telepsychiatric services.","Tokell, Marisa; Lin, Chung M A; Dave, Subodh; Abraham, Seri; Ramkisson, Roshelle; Mahalingappa, Sridevi S; Pillai, Anilkumar S; Matheiken, Shevonne; Iliani, Yaara Z; McNally, Rosalind; Bamrah, J S; Tokell, Marisa",BJS Open,255,6

This article explores why gender was neglected in previous health emergencies, what led to change in visibility of gender issues during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the implications of such change for understanding the relationship between gender and global health security. The article explores the question of neglect by drawing on original research into the 2014–16 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, its aftermath and implications for future pandemic preparedness. The article then looks in detail at the research efforts, funding, epistemic community activism and impact of COVID-19 to explain why gender received high profile political attention and acknowledgment. The article argues that the change in visibility, research and advocacy around gender equality during the COVID-19 outbreak does not demonstrate an advancement in gender equality in global health. To the contrary, such visibility reinforces the inherent problems of global health security evident in the 2014–16 Ebola outbreak that create and reproduce binaries of neglect and visibility, and hierarchies of the global health issues that matter, the people that matter and the women that matter. What unites neglect and visibility of gender in global health security is that gender is understood as solution rather than threat. Combined these factors make gender equality incompatible with global health security.","Harman, Sophie",Int Aff,255,26

The Covid-19 pandemic has severely impacted this engagement in two ways. First, social distancing measures forbid most face-to-face participatory activities originally envisioned in projects. Second, the restrictions have caused hardships for the stakeholders being engaged by these projects. We assessed the impact of Covid-19 on stakeholder engagement activities in ongoing EU marine science projects by posing the following questions: What problems has Covid-19 caused for the workflow and outcomes of current research projects, (ii) how have scientists responsible for stakeholder engagement coped with the situation, and (iii) if alternative stakeholder activities were implemented, how have these been evaluated? Our survey was conducted nearly 2 months after the onset of Covid-19 lockdowns.

Two extensions are offered to compare the performance of the linear specification of the market model (LMM), which allows for the measurement of the cryptocurrency price beta risk. The first is the generalized additive model, which permits flexibility in the rigid shape of the linearity of the LMM. The second is the time-varying linearity specification of the LMM (Tv-LMM), which is based on the state space model form via the Kalman filter, allowing for the measurement of the time-varying beta risk of the cryptocurrency price. The analysis is performed using daily data from both time periods on the top 10 cryptocurrencies by adjusted market capitalization, using the Crypto Currency Index 30 (CCI30) as a market proxy and 1-day and 7-day forward predictions. Such a comparison of cryptocurrency prices has yet to be undertaken in the literature. The empirical findings favor the Tv-LMM, which outperforms the others in terms of modeling and forecasting performance. This result suggests that the relationship between each cryptocurrency price and the CCI30 index should be locally instead of globally linear, especially during the COVID-19 period.","Neslihanoglu, Serdar",Financ Innov,255,12

Twenty adult children of an ill person were interviewed via phone and video call, in adherence with the restrictions against COVID-19. Thematic analysis showed five main themes: the care-giver's experience, the care recipient's experience, relationships with care recipients, changes in the care routine and resources. Results pointed out that the time needed in the care routine and everyday activities increased during the pandemic, together with the need to find alternatives to physical activity at home. Depending on one's personal experience of COVID-19 and approach to preventive rules, the availability of resources, and formal and informal support, three main approaches to care were identified: apprehensive, mindful and fatalistic ones. The pandemic amplified the differences among these already-existing approaches to care as well as the typical challenges and difficulties experienced by family care-givers, and it resulted in an increased burden connected to practical difficulties, emotional stress and difficulties in reaching for help. These results underline the importance of strengthening the external support network for older people to help family care-givers, especially during emergencies.","Cipolletta, Sabrina; Morandini, Benedetta; Tomaino, Silvia Caterina Maria",,255,22

For three‐quarters of over 1,100 available monitoring stations, the average nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) concentrations decreased by at least 2.7 μg·m(−3) (or 25%) compared with the average concentrations recorded during the same period of the previous seven years. This reduction was not specific to urban or rural areas because the relative reduction was of similar magnitude in both areas. The ozone (O(3)) response differed spatially, with positive anomalies in Northern Europe and negative anomalies in Southwestern Europe. Reduced cloudiness and related enhanced radiation in Northern Europe played a significant role in the increase of surface O(3) concentrations by shifting the photochemical partitioning between NO(2) and O(3) toward more O(3). The level of total oxidant (O(x) = O(3) + NO(2)) remained unchanged, except in Southwestern Europe where it decreased. Several episodes lasting a few days of a high level of total oxidants were observed in Northern Europe. The results illustrate the complexity of the atmospheric response to the unprecedented reduction in the emission of primary pollutants.","Deroubaix, Adrien; Brasseur, Guy; Gaubert, Benjamin; Labuhn, Inga; Menut, Laurent; Siour, Guillaume; Tuccella, Paolo",,255,5

Compared to previous years, there was a 66% reduction in student lab dissection times for the first‐year medical students (MS1s) at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. Complete Anatomy (CA), a three‐dimensional (3D) anatomy atlas, was provided as an additional educational resource to supplement the in person cadaveric dissection labs. The aim of this study is to increase student engagement by producing tailored anatomical modules in CA and to evaluate their effects on students’ stress levels and summative practical exam performance throughout the Clinically Oriented Anatomy (COA) block. We hypothesized that the CA modules would allow current MS1s to perform to the same academic standard as students who did not have these COVID‐19 limitations and reduce their exam stress. METHODS: Learning modules were created that displayed 3D anatomical structures corresponding to each of the 27 COA in person dissection labs. The CA modules consisted of content and quizzes that MS1s could access either outside or inside the lab. At the end of each of the three COA units and at the end of the COA block, students were surveyed about their participation and satisfaction with the modules. Students’ performance on module quizzes was compared to their performance on summative practical exams. Additionally, the Class of 2023’s performance in COA was compared to the Class of 2024’s, with the latter taking the block under pandemic restrictions. RESULTS: Throughout the block, 82%‐95% (unit 1 n=97/102, unit 2 n=67/72, unit 3 n=107/130) of survey respondents reported using the modules as a study aid and 55%‐79% used the modules for all 27 anatomy labs. Additionally, 75%‐87% of MS1s rated the modules as “very useful” or higher on a Likert‐scale survey, with a majority of surveyed students using both the content and quizzes. At the end of the block a second survey showed 74% (n=70/94) of students “strongly agreed” or “agreed” that using the modules reduced their stress, and 80% (n=75/94) “strongly agreed” or “agreed” that modules allowed them to continue their learning outside of the lab. MS1 performance in the COA block was positively correlated with performance on CA quizzes (r=0.46, p<0.0001). Further, there was no significant difference between the 2023 and 2024 MS1 classes in summative practical exam scores for units 1 and 3, as well as in the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) exam. However, there was a significant increase in summative practical exam performance in the Class of 2024 for unit 2 (p<0.0001) as compared to the Class of 2023. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that the CA modules facilitated student engagement in anatomy and positively enhanced their medical education throughout the COA block. Although dissection time and lab access were limited, the CA modules benefitted the students and could have potentially compensated for that lost time.","Wall, John; Rodriguez, Jaremy; Dang, Michael; Kaur, Gurvinder; Bishop, Keith; Schneider, Brandt",FASEB J,255,1

This paper extends prior research by exploring how in-person and online book clubs using nonfiction texts can be used as a tool to engage and introduce students to sociological ideas. Book clubs were implemented in eight different sections across three courses. The structure and format of the book clubs varied considerably. We identify best practices for incorporating book clubs into sociology courses. Drawing on data from instructor-designed surveys, institutional course evaluations, and course exams, we also examine how book clubs influence student attitudes and learning outcomes. We conclude that book clubs can be adapted to fit a variety of courses and across different types of institutions.","Wyant, Amanda; Bowen, Sarah",Teach Sociol,255,1

SUMMARY ANSWER: Transcriptomic analyses of SARS-CoV–2-associated receptors and proteases strongly suggest that blastocysts are most permissive to SARS-CoV–2 compared with mature oocytes and day 3 embryos. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Very few studies analyzed the gene expression profiles of SARS-CoV–2-associated receptors and proteases, mainly focusing on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression, resulting in partial knowledge in different specimens from female genital tract. To date, the gene expression profile of SARS-CoV–2 host entry candidates in the entire preimplantation embryos is scarcely available. Moreover, reports on oocyte and granulosa cells susceptibilityto SARS-CoV–2 are very sparse. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: To address this question, we retrospectively examined the gene expression profiles of SARS-CoV–2-associated receptors and proteases in human granulosa cells (GCs), cumulus cells (CCs), mature oocytes, day 3 embryos, blastocysts and trophectoderm cells obtained from our previously described Affymetrix microarray data. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Human GCs and CCs (n = 17), mature oocytes (n = 6), and preimplantation embryos (n = 20) were analyzed. The comparison of gene expression levels of receptors and proteases closely related to SARS-CoV–2 infection. For each gene, the number of samples with the probe set ‘present’, based on the detection call, was analyzed. Each probe set was classified according to the signal intensity value median, as low (<100), medium (100–200) or high expression level (>200). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: ACE2, BSG, CTSL, CTSA were detectable at high expression level in all mature oocyte samples, while only CTSL was strongly expressed in all day 3 embryos. The most representative dual co-expression of SARS-CoV–2-associated receptor and protease (60% of samples) during the embryonic genome activation stage (EGA) was ACE2-CTSL and BSG-CTSL. In blastocysts, ACE2, BSG, CTSL, CTSA and FURIN were detectable in the entire cohort at high expression level, and the prevalence of the different dual co-expression of SARS-CoV–2-associated proteases and receptors was optimal (100% of samples). Interestingly, only CTSL was detectable in all trophectoderm samples and a prevalence of 60% was found for the BSG-CTSL co-expression. ACE2, BSG, CTSL and CTSA were present at high expression level in CCs samples. In contrast, ACE2 and BSG expression was very low while CTSL and CTSA showed a high expression level in GCs.A prevalence of 100% was reported for ACE2-CTSL, ACE2-CTSA co-expression for both cell types. In addition, BSG-CTSL and BSG-CTSA co-expression were also present in all CCs against ∼70% in GCs samples. This data suggest a potential risks of SARS-CoV–2 infection either GC or early embryo development. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Analyses of Affymetrix microarray gene expression data were performed in non-COVID–19 patients. Whether the SARS-CoV–2 infection change the gene expression profile of SARS-CoV–2-associated receptors and proteases is under investigation. Wider implications of the findings: Specimens from female genital tract may be considered as potential targets for SARS-CoV–2.

It often occurs in preschool children and affects their growth and development, so the coping measures for this disease are more prevention than treatment. In this study, the clinical data of 2133 children with diarrhea were collected. Based on the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm of wavelet transform, a related model for data mining and processing of children's intestinal ultrasound images and stool specimens was constructed. Then, the norovirus infection trend was warned based on the wavelet analysis algorithm model. The results showed that the intestinal ultrasound image processed by the wavelet transform algorithm was clearer. The positive detection rate of norovirus in children with clinical diarrhea was as high as 59%, and the children had different degrees of body damage, of which the probability of compensatory metabolic acidosis was the highest. The epidemiological analysis found that children with norovirus infection were mainly concentrated in the age group under 2 years old and over 5 years old and showed a peak of infection in December. In summary, the intelligent algorithm based on wavelet transform can realize the noise reduction of intestinal ultrasound, and it should protect children with susceptible age and susceptible seasons to reduce the clinical infection rate of norovirus.","Fan, Xucheng; Xue, Na; Han, Zhiguo; Wang, Chao; Ma, Heer; Lu, Yaoqin",J Healthc Eng,255,24

A Neuroimaging Perspective.,15.934377,6.774575,2020-06-11,"BACKGROUND The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) has recently proposed a consensus on the criteria to diagnose malnutrition. The validity of the new criteria to detect malnutrition is still being explored. Therefore, this study aimed to verify the validity of the GLIM criteria for malnutrition in hospitalized patients with gastric cancer (GC) using the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) as a comparator. METHODS This is a cross-sectional study involving 217 GC inpatients. Nutrition assessment was performed during their hospitalization with both the GLIM criteria and the PG-SGA. Consistency of the assessment results and their correlation with the quality of life in patients were evaluated. RESULTS A moderate concordance (K = 0.483, P < 0.001) was founded between the two methods for malnutrition diagnosis. Spearman correlation analysis confirmed the significant association (P < 0.05) between most aspects of the quality of life and nutrition status regarding either the GLIM criteria or the PG-SGA. In multivariate linear regression, adjusted for confounding variables, the quality of life was significantly associated with nutrition status by the GLIM criteria (B = 5.63, 95% CI: 0.09-11.16, P = 0.046), and by the PG-SGA (B = 13.53, 95% CI: 7.78-19.27, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS This study provides a new understanding of the validity of the GLIM criteria in hospitalized GC patients. In the study, we have found that the new GLIM criteria are of concurrent and clinical validity in GC inpatients, suggested by the comparison with the PG-SGA and its correlation with the quality of life.","Qin, Liyuan; Tian, Qiuju; Zhu, Weiyi; Wu, Beiwen",Nutrition and cancer,255,1

Viral nuclear import antagonists, expressed by several highly pathogenic RNA viruses, likely mediate pleiotropic effects on host gene expression, presumably interfering with transcription factors, cytokines, hormones, and/or signaling cascades that occur in response to infection. By bioinformatic and systems biology approaches, we evaluated the impact of nuclear import antagonism on host expression networks by using human lung epithelial cells infected with either wild-type virus or a mutant that does not express ORF6 protein. Microarray analysis revealed significant changes in differential gene expression, with approximately twice as many upregulated genes in the mutant virus samples by 48 h postinfection, despite identical viral titers. Our data demonstrated that ORF6 protein expression attenuates the activity of numerous karyopherin-dependent host transcription factors (VDR, CREB1, SMAD4, p53, EpasI, and Oct3/4) that are critical for establishing antiviral responses and regulating key host responses during virus infection. Results were confirmed by proteomic and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay analyses and in parallel microarray studies using infected primary human airway epithelial cell cultures. The data strongly support the hypothesis that viral antagonists of nuclear import actively manipulate host responses in specific hierarchical patterns, contributing to the viral pathogenic potential in vivo. Importantly, these studies and modeling approaches not only provide templates for evaluating virus antagonism of nuclear import processes but also can reveal candidate cellular genes and pathways that may significantly influence disease outcomes following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in vivo.","Sims, Amy C; Tilton, Susan C; Menachery, Vineet D; Gralinski, Lisa E; Schäfer, Alexandra; Matzke, Melissa M; Webb-Robertson, Bobbie-Jo M; Chang, Jean; Luna, Maria L; Long, Casey E; Shukla, Anil K; Bankhead, Armand R; Burkett, Susan E; Zornetzer, Gregory; Tseng, Chien-Te Kent; Metz, Thomas O; Pickles, Raymond; McWeeney, Shannon; Smith, Richard D; Katze, Michael G; Waters, Katrina M; Baric, Ralph S",Journal of virology,255,22

To achieve these performance benefits of the ""tipless"" design, however, it is crucial to adhere to the recommended surgical procedure. We introduced a polymer-based patient model that mimics a dilated cardiomyopathy apex for inflow cannula implantation training. Here, we used the model to simulate appropriate and inappropriate techniques for inflow suturing. With the appropriate technique, the inflow ostium is aligned on the endocardial plane, and the cut myocardial surface is not exposed to the bloodstream. By contrast, with the inappropriate technique, which is represented as a worst-case suturing scenario, the inflow ostium is misaligned, thus exposing the cut myocardial cross-section to the bloodstream. This misalignment can predispose to platelet deposition, thrombus formation, and pannus formation with long-term support. Repeated training with this human apex model is important to confirm the inflow position and intraventricular finish before moving on to human cases. Along with rigorous preclinical training, technical adherence will help to ensure better clinical outcomes.","Motomura, Tadashi; Kelly, Brian",ASAIO journal,255,1

The device gradually slows flow of blood into the aneurysm, but the high metal coverage of PED promotes endothelialization of the device. Occasionally, this leads to in-stent stenosis that is clinically well tolerated. We present a multi-institutional Pipeline series that includes three cases of gradual asymptomatic occlusion within the PED and parent vessel. METHODS Institutional databases at each participating center were searched for patients treated with the PED. Patients with at least 50% stenosis or occlusion were selected and all relevant clinical and radiographic data were reviewed. RESULTS A total of 326 cases performed by five neurointerventionalists across four institutions were reviewed. Among these there were three cases of complete occlusion and two cases of stenosis of more than 50%, for an occlusion rate of 0.9%. All patients were clinically asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS A gradual tourniquet-like occlusion can occur following placement of the PED, leading to vessel occlusion. This has been clinically well tolerated by patients in our series due to the formation of pial collaterals as the stenosis progresses, likely due to ischemic preconditioning. Small parent vessel, pre-existing stenosis, fusiform pathology, overlapping devices, and suboptimal antiplatelet therapy seem to be predisposing factors. Further experience and follow-up will allow us to characterize the risk factors and optimize post-procedural therapy for these patients.","Srinivasan, Visish M; Mokin, Maxim; Duckworth, Edward A M; Chen, Stephen; Puri, Ajit; Kan, Peter",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,255,11

Oxygenation of vital organs is maintained with preferential perfusion at the expense of less vital organs, challenging the fetal cardiovascular system. OBJECTIVES To identify cardiovascular compromise in preterm small for gestational age (SGA) infants using the cardiac biomarker B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), which indicates the workload of the myocardium. METHODS In this retrospective case-control study, 26 SGA infants born at less than 32 weeks of gestation from October 2009 to October 2010 were matched for gestational age and month of birth with 26 appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants. Antenatal Doppler ultrasound was used to identify fetal hemodynamic changes by determination of the pulsatility index (PI) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA-PI), umbilical artery (UA-PI) and veins of the ductus venosus (DV-PIV). These indices were compared with BNP levels obtained within 6 h after birth. RESULTS Antenatal PIs of MCA, UA and DV were significantly related to elevated BNP levels after birth in SGA infants, but not in AGA infants (SGA: MCA-PI = r(2) 0.23, p < 0.05; UA-PI = r(2) 0.46, p < 0.01; DV-PIV = r(2) 0.31, p < 0.05). Furthermore, signs of perinatal (chronic) asphyxia coincided with elevated levels of BNP. SGA was related to more postnatal cardiocirculatory complications. No significant relations between postnatal cardiac ultrasound measurements, placenta size and BNP were found. CONCLUSION BNP levels were elevated early after birth in SGA infants and corresponded positively with Doppler indices of circulatory compromise. This suggests an increased workload of the myocardium.","Vijlbrief, Daniel C; van Bel, Frank; Molenschot, Mirella C; Benders, Manon J N L; Pistorius, Lou R; Kemperman, Hans; de Vries, Willem B",Neonatology,255,26

Few studies are dedicated to this topic. We aimed to determine incidence and characteristics of these specific viral NIs at our hospital. METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of nosocomial gastroenteritis and respiratory tract infections (RTIs) of hospitalized patients at the University Children's Hospital Basel over a 12-month period. Patients with new-onset gastroenteritis or RTI during hospitalization or a physician diagnosis of NI on discharge were included for analysis. NIs were defined by use of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations and specific agents' incubation periods. RESULTS Overall, 5493 patients were hospitalized accounting for 22,251 hospital days. Forty-five (0.8%) patients acquired an NI: 15 cases of gastroenteritis (mean age, 9.9 months; range: 3-24; NI incidence: 0.7 per 1000 hospitalization days) and 30 cases of RTI (mean age, 63.7 months; range: 1-174; NI incidence: 1.3 per 1000 hospitalization days). Main agents were rotavirus (10/15 gastroenteritis, 67%) and rhinovirus (22/30 nosocomial RTI; 73%). Physicians reported 9 cases of NI, of which 2 (22%) did not fulfill the criteria for an NI, 3 were surgical site infections, 1 was a case of rotavirus gastroenteritis and 3 were RTIs by rhinovirus. CONCLUSIONS Viral NIs, especially caused by rotavirus and rhinovirus, are frequent in children of all ages but underestimated if exclusively reported by physicians. Prospective studies should further investigate the role and epidemiology of rhinovirus in nosocomial RTI, ideally by use of automated information technology support.","Sidler, Jan A; Haberthür, Cedric; Dumoulin, Alexis; Hirsch, Hans H; Heininger, Ulrich",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,255,1

Case presentation A 75-year-old man noted discomfort at the inner canthus of his left eye when he blinked. A tumor of the lacrimal caruncle was identified and resected. The base of the tumor had a smooth surface and was whitish. In addition, a ""navel-like structure"" was seen, and the findings strongly suggested sebaceous gland hyperplasia of the lacrimal caruncle. The apical portion of the tumor was a papillomatous lesion. Histological examination of the resected tumor led to a diagnosis of sebaceous gland hyperplasia. Human papillomavirus-51 was detected in the apical portion by in situ hybridization. Based on these results, the final diagnosis was sebaceous gland hyperplasia with papilloma. No recurrence of either tumor has been observed up to 3 years postoperatively. Conclusion This might be the first report of a case of coincidence of sebaceous gland hyperplasia and papilloma, even though the association between these two lesions was unclear, including which developed first.","Miura-Karasawa, Maria; Toshida, Hiroshi; Ohta, Toshihiko; Murakami, Akira",International medical case reports journal,255,10

METHODS The study compared 50 OPSCC patients treated with TMR+RFF to 50 OPSCC patients receiving pCRT. The time taken to swallow water served as the primary endpoint. The Saxon test, maxillomandibular distance, Mallampati score, ratio of height to weight, nasal penetration, tracheostomy/gastral tube requirement, and four validated questionnaires (visual analog scale for xerostomia, Sicca VAS; MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory, MDADI; Voice Handicap Index, VHI; European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, Head and Neck Cancer, 35 items, QLQ-H&N35) were applied to access functionality and quality of life. RESULTS Patients after TMR+RFF showed an increased rate of nasal penetration (p < 0.0001), which was associated with a longer water swallowing time (p < 0.05). A modified reconstruction of the soft palate significantly decreased the rate of nasal penetration in comparison to classical reconstruction (p = 0.0001). Patients with pCRT suffered significantly more xerostomia (Saxon test) than patients with TMR+RFF and adjuvant therapy. None of the subjective questionnaires revealed significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSION TMR+RFF with modified reconstruction and adjuvant treatment and pCRT showed comparable functional outcomes.","Knopf, A; Mansour, N; Hofauer, B; Johnson, F; Bier, H; Wakonig, F; Teutsch, S",HNO,255,16

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and cytokines are known to restrict immune responses against viral infections. We conducted this study to explore the role of Tregs, cytokines, and antibody production after influenza vaccination. The whole blood was collected from healthy subjects (n = 36) before and two weeks after influenza vaccine immunization for two or three consecutive years. The cell surface markers, intracellular staining of Foxp3(+) Tregs, and Th1/Th2 cytokines were determined. The antibody titer was detected using the hemagglutination inhibition test. The CD3(+), CD127(+), CD4(+)CD25(+) and CD4(+)Foxp3(+) cells were increased significantly post vaccination. The plasma level of the transforming growth factor (TGF-β), but not interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IFN-γ, TNF-α, was also found to increase significantly after vaccination. We further correlated the cytokine fold-increases with the anti-influenza antibody titer for individual post vaccination. It was found that the IL-10 level after vaccination correlated with the fold-increases of anti-H1N1, anti-H3N2, anti-B/Yamagata, and anti-B/Victoria antibodies. But, a negative relationship occurs between the TGF-β level and fold-increases of anti-H1N1, anti-H3N2, anti-B/Yamagata, and anti-B/Victoria antibodies post vaccination. Treg cells and TGF-β seem to participate in the downregulation of the anti-influenza antibody response post influenza vaccination. Alteration of Treg activity might enhance influenza vaccine antibody responses and efficacy.","Wang, Shih-Min; Tsai, Ming-Hsun; Lei, Huan-Yao; Wang, Jen-Ren; Liu, Ching-Chuan",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,255,16

Yet, recent results in the auditory system indicate that stochastic regularities may not be easily encoded when a rare medium pitch deviant is presented between frequent high and low pitch standard sounds in random order, as reflected in the lack of sensory prediction error event-related potentials [i.e., mismatch negativity (MMN)]. We wanted to test the implication of the predictive coding theory that predictions based on higher-order generative models-here, based on action intention, are fed top-down in the hierarchy to sensory levels. Participants produced random sequences of high and low pitch sounds by button presses in two conditions: In a ""specific"" condition, one button produced high and the other low pitch sounds; in an ""unspecific"" condition, both buttons randomly produced high or low-pitch sounds. Rare medium pitch deviants elicited larger MMN and N2 responses in the ""specific"" compared to the ""unspecific"" condition, despite equal sound probabilities. These results thus demonstrate that action-effect predictions can boost stochastic regularity-based predictions and engage higher-order deviance detection processes, extending previous notions on the role of action predictions at sensory levels.","Korka, Betina; Schröger, Erich; Widmann, Andreas",Scientific reports,255,25

With the intensification of globalization and increasing gaps between countries, new and reemerging health threats such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Ebola, and Zika and a gradual rethinking on security concepts framed a new political context. The health problems addressed diplomatically have also become diverse ranging from neglected tropical diseases, infectious diseases, sale of unsafe, counterfeit drugs to brain drain crisis. We see that global health has become more diverse as the actors widened and also the interests appealing not only to the traditional humanitarian ideals associated with health but also to the principles grounded in national and global security. Recently, we are witnessing the increased priority given to the GHD because the issue of health is discussed by various actors outside the WHO to shape the global policy for health determinants.

The purpose of the present study is to review the literature to identify the features of each exams which are used to identify the pathogens associated with PJI, to evaluate which are the most sensitive and specific and to set up an algorithm to decide when, in the field of two-stage revision, it's the ideal timing to re-implant. MATERIALS AND METHODS We did a systematic review of the literature to look for peer-reviewed papers of any evidence level focusing on: (1) Microbiological and molecular exams for identification of PJI-related pathogens. (2) Nuclear imaging methods, which can help in the identification of a PJI. Special attention was focused to analyse which is the sensitivity and specificity of these exams. RESULTS Overall, 64 manuscripts met the criteria of the systematic search at point 1 and 7 manuscripts at point 2. Among microbiological and molecular exams, the average of sensitivity and specificity were respectively 65.6% and 94.4% for cultural exams, 74.1% and 95.2% for molecular diagnosis and 86.9% and 96% for MicroDTTect.

However, the effect and mechanisms of T. denticola on accumulation of Aβ remain to be unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that T. denticola was able to enter the brain and act directly on nerve cells resulting in intra- and extracellular Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 accumulation in the hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice by selectively activating both β-secretase and γ-secretase. Furthermore, both KMI1303, an inhibitor of β-secretase, as well as DAPT, an inhibitor of γ- secretase, were found to be able to inhibit the effect of T. denticola on Aβ accumulation in N2a neuronal cells. Overall, it is concluded that T. denticola increases the expression of Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 by its regulation on beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 and presenilin 1.","Su, Xinyi; Tang, Zhiqun; Lu, Zhiyue; Liu, Yuqiu; He, Wanzhi; Jiang, Jiapei; Zhang, Yifan; Wu, Hongkun",Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,255,1

We have developed a new homemade VHC, made of a paper coffee cup, and a drinking water bottle. This study was conducted to compare the bronchodilator response in children with airway hyperresponsiveness after the use of our homemade VHC and that of a standard commercial one. METHODS In a randomized, two-period, two-sequence crossover trial, we recruited 20 children, aged 6-15 years, who had a greater than 12% increase in FEV1 after inhaled salbutamol. They were randomized into Group A and B. Group A used our VHC on the first day and Aerochamber® on the second day. Group B used the same VHCs but in alternate sequence. Spirometries were performed before and after 400 µg of salbutamol, MDI was administered via those VHCs. RESULTS Baseline demographic data and spirometric values did not have statistically significant differences between group A and B and between the first and second day (p > .05). After giving salbutamol MDI, both VHCs produced significant increases in FVC, FEV1 , and FEF25-75% (p < .005). The improvement in FEV1 did not significantly differ between our homemade VHC and Aerochamber® (p > .05). CONCLUSION Our homemade VHC is effective for an MDI bronchodilator delivery. Since it is very cheap and easy to make, it may be used as a disposable device to minimize airborne transmission especially when commercial VHC is not available.","Chaicoming, Kesanee; Preutthipan, Aroonwan; Adirekkittikun, Anusorn; Nugboon, Malinee",Pediatric pulmonology,255,1

The unique proposition of this research is to use a combination of soil and adsorbent properties to enhance the remediation of heavy metals such as nickel, copper and zinc. A comparative study through statistical analysis is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the various SAT systems build using various combinations of SM and SC soil types along with bioadsorbents such as eucalyptus leaves, sawdust and Mosambi peel. Further, the mass balance analysis of heavy metals is carried out to comprehend the course of expulsion. The study, through a statistical approach, endorses that the SAT in conjunction with adsorbent gives much better removal efficiency than the SAT without adsorbent. Additional removal efficiency of 14% to 30% can be achieved with introduction of adsorbents within the SAT system. The optimal removal efficiency of nickel, copper and zinc was observed to be at 87, 98 and 93% respectively when passed through the combination of SM soil with sawdust.","Rekha, K H; Lokeshappa, B",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,255,1

However, the diagnosis of IIVDE is challenging because the prognosis and imaging characteristics are poorly characterized. OBJECTIVES We aimed to describe the clinical and imaging characteristics of tentatively diagnosed IIVDE in dogs to assess the prognostic utility of neurological grade and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. METHODS Twenty dogs were included in this retrospective cohort study. RESULTS Nonchondrodystrophic breeds (n = 16) were more predisposed than chondrodystrophic breeds. Most dogs showed acute onset of clinical signs. Neurological examination at admission showed predominant non-ambulatory paraparesis (n = 9); paresis (n = 16) was confirmed more frequently than paralysis (n = 4). Follow-up neurological examination results were only available for 11 dogs, ten of whom showed neurological improvement and 8 showed successful outcomes at 1 month. The characteristic MRI findings include thoracic vertebra (T)2 hyperintense, T1 hypointense, intramedullary linear tracts with reduced disc volume, and cleft of the annulus fibrosus. None of the MRI measurements were significantly correlated with neurological grade at admission. Neurological grade did not differ according to the presence of parenchymal hemorrhage, parenchymal contrast enhancement, and meningeal contrast enhancement. Neurological grades at admission showed a statistical correlation with those observed at the 1-month follow-up (r = 0.814, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS IIVDE is a rare form of disc extrusion commonly experienced after physical activity or trauma and most frequently affects the cranial-cervical and thoracolumbar regions of nonchondrodystrophic dog breeds. Neurological score at admission emerged as a more useful prognostic indicator than MRI findings in dogs with suspected IIVDE.","Kim, Jaehwan; Kim, Hyoju; Hwang, Jeongyeon; Eom, Kidong",Journal of veterinary science,255,11

METHODS A total of 80 patients who had been hospitalized in the internal medicine clinic were enrolled in the study. The cases were allocated into two groups, i.e., COVID (+) and (-), based on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory [NLR, platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), complete blood count, biochemistry, and serology] data of the patients were retrospectively obtained from the hospital data management system. RESULTS NLR and fever levels were found to be higher in COVID-19 (+) cases (P=0.021, P=0.001, respectively). There was no difference between males and females with regard to COVID-19 positivity (P=0.527). Total bilirubin levels were found to be lower in COVID-19 (+) cases (P=0.040). When the ROC analysis was carried out for NLR in COVID-19 (+) cases, the AUC value was found to be 0.660 (P=0.021), sensitivity as 69.01 %, specificity as 65.40 %, LR+: 1.98 and LR- : 0.48, PPV: 80.43, and NPV: 50.00, when the NLR was ≥2.4. The risk of COVID-19 was found to be 20.3-fold greater when NLR was ≥ 2.4 in the logistic regression (P=0.007). CONCLUSION NLR is an independent predictor for the diagnosis of COVID-19. We also found that fever and total bilirubin measurements could be useful for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in this population.","Nalbant, Ahmet; Kaya, Tezcan; Varim, Ceyhun; Yaylaci, Selçuk; Tamer, Ali; Cinemre, Hakan",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,255,27

OBJECTIVES To explore the possibility of predicting final body height at maturity based on associating parameters at the time of diagnosing adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), while examining the effect of curve magnitude and deterioration. METHODS A total of 284 female patients with AIS (mean age 12.2 ± 1.1 years, 52.5% premenarchal) were followed till skeletal maturity, indicated by ≥Risser stage 4, static body height and arm span over the past 6 months, and postmenarche 2 years. Standing body height, arm span, menarchal status, Risser staging, distal radius and ulna (DRU) classification, Sanders staging (SS), Cobb angles (major and minor curves), and Lenke curve types at initial presentation were examined. Patients with/without curve deterioration were compared. Multiple linear regression was used for predicting final body height (cm), and remaining height increase (%). RESULTS Baseline body height was 152.1 ± 7.1 cm and major curve Cobb angle was 27.1° ± 7.4°, whereas at maturity they were 159.5 ± 5.4 cm and 32.5° ± 9.3°, respectively. For patients presented at Risser stage 0 or 1, radius grade (R) 6, ulnar grade (U) 5, or SS3, those with curve deterioration exhibited greater height increase potential at initial presentation (P < .05) than those without deterioration. No intergroup difference was found for patients presented at ≥Risser 2, R7, U6, SS4. Predictive baseline parameters were age, body height, Cobb angle (major curve), curve type, and DRU grades. Prediction models of final body height (R 2 = 0.735, P < .001) and remaining height increase (R 2 = 0.742, P < .001) were established. CONCLUSIONS Final body height prediction model was derived for female patients with AIS, with baseline body height and ulnar grading having larger impacts than other parameters.","Cheung, Prudence Wing Hang; Mannem, Abhishek; Cheung, Jason Pui Yin",Global spine journal,255,27

International violence, abuse and mental health network (iVAMHN) members recognised the need to identify barriers and priorities to develop this field. METHODS Informed by collaborative discussion between iVAMHN members, we conducted a pilot study using an online survey to identify research, education and capacity building priorities for violence, abuse and mental health in LMICs. We analysed free-text responses using thematic analysis. RESULTS 35 senior (29%) and junior researchers (29%), non-government or voluntary sector staff (18%), health workers (11%), students (11%) and administrators (3%) completed the survey. Respondents worked in 24 LMICs, with 20% working in more than one country. Seventy-four percent of respondents worked in sub-Saharan Africa, 37% in Asia and smaller proportions in Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Respondents described training, human resource, funding and sensitivity-related barriers to researching violence, abuse and mental health in LMICs and recommended a range of actions to build capacity, streamline research pathways, increase efficiency and foster collaborations and co-production. CONCLUSION The intersection between violence, abuse and mental health in LMICs is a priority for individuals with a range of expertise across health, social care and the voluntary sector. There is interest in and support for building a strong network of parties engaged in research, service evaluation, training and education in this field. Networks like iVAMHN can act as hubs, bringing together diverse stakeholders for collaboration, co-production and mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and skills.","Keynejad, Roxanne C; Bentley, Abigail; Bhatia, Urvita; Nalwadda, Oliva; Mekonnen, Fikru Debebe; Ali, Parveen A; McGarry, Julie",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,255,1

It is difficult to determine, however, those patients for whom atomoxetine will be both effective and advantageous. Patients may need to take the medication for several weeks before therapeutic benefit is apparent, so a biomarker that could predict atomoxetine effectiveness early in the course of treatment could be clinically useful. There has been increased interest in the study of thalamocortical oscillatory activity using quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) as a biomarker in ADHD. In this study, we investigated qEEG absolute power, relative power, and cordance, which have been shown to predict response to reuptake inhibitor antidepressants in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), as potential predictors of response to atomoxetine. Forty-four young adults with ADHD (ages 18-30) enrolled in a multi-site, double-blind placebo-controlled study of the effectiveness of atomoxetine and underwent serial qEEG recordings at pretreatment baseline and one week after the start of medication. qEEG measures were calculated from a subset of the sample (N = 29) that provided useable qEEG recordings. Left temporoparietal cordance in the theta frequency band after one week of treatment was associated with ADHD symptom improvement and quality of life measured at 12 weeks in atomoxetine-treated subjects, but not in those treated with placebo. Neither absolute nor relative power measures selectively predicted improvement in medication-treated subjects. Measuring theta cordance after one week of treatment could be useful in predicting atomoxetine treatment response in adult ADHD.","Leuchter, Andrew F; McGough, James J; Korb, Alexander S; Hunter, Aimee M; Glaser, Paul E A; Deldar, Ahmed; Durell, Todd M; Cook, Ian A",Journal of psychiatric research,255,1

The innate immune regulation has an important role in this process; however, the specific mechanisms are not completely clear. Using the LPS + D-GalN-induced ALF mouse model, we found that the survival rate of PTPN14-deficient mice was higher than that of the control group, while the release of inflammatory factors was significantly lower. We further showed that PTPN14 interacted with SOCS7, and promoted the degradation of SOCS7 through ubiquitination at K11 and K48, thereby reducing the protein level of SOCS7 and weakening the inhibitory effects on inflammatory factors. More importantly, SOCS7 blocked the NF-κB signaling pathway by preventing the activity of the IKK complex, and then reduced the expression of downstream inflammatory factors. In this study, we firstly reported the inhibitory effect of SOCS7 on the NF-κB pathway in the ALF mouse model and elucidated the mechanism of PTPN14-SOCS7-NF-κB axis in the regulation of inflammation.

BACKGROUND The risk of cerebral embolization persists throughout the carotid artery stenting procedure and remains during the stent healing period. METHODS A total of 30 consecutive patients (age 71.6 ± 7.6 years, 63% male) meeting the conventional carotid artery stenting inclusion criteria were enrolled in 4 centers in Germany and Poland. RESULTS The primary combined endpoint was the procedure success of the CGuard system and the number and volume of new lesions on the ipsilateral side assessed by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging at 48 h post-procedure and at 30 days. The secondary endpoint was 30-day major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (death, stroke, or myocardial infarction). Protection devices were used in all procedures. Procedure success was 100%, with 0% procedural complications. The 30-day major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events rate was 0%. New ipsilateral ischemic lesions at 48 h occurred in 37.0% of patients and the average lesion volume was 0.039 ± 0.08 cm(3). The 30-day diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed complete resolution of all but 1 periprocedural lesion and only 1 new minor (0.116 cm(3)) lesion in relation to the 48-h scan.

METHODS A systematic search following PRISMA guidelines, registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020156275), was conducted for psychosocial interventions targeting depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation/behaviour in SMEs. The PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and two specific occupational health databases were searched, as well as four databases for grey literature, without time limit until 2nd December 2019. RESULTS In total, 1283 records were identified, 70 were retained for full-text screening, and seven met the inclusion criteria: three randomised controlled trials (RCTs), three before and after designs and one non-randomised trial, comprising 5111 participants. Study quality was low to moderate according to the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Five studies showed a reduction in depression and anxiety symptoms using techniques based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), two reported no significant change. LIMITATIONS Low number and high heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes, high attrition and lack of rigorous RCTs. CONCLUSIONS Preliminary evidence indicates CBT-based interventions can be effective in targeting symptoms of depression and anxiety in SME employees.

One of the most demanding procedures in limb salvage surgery is the reconstruction of bony defects after tumour resection. Even though still limited in clinical practice, early results of the use of 3D technology are gradually revealing its potentially huge impact in bone tumour surgery. Here, we present a case series illustrating our experience with the use of 3D printing technology in the reconstruction of bone defects after tumour resection, and its impact on cosmesis and quality of life. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of 11 patients in whom a custom-made 3D-printed prosthesis was used to reconstruct a bone defect after resection for a bone tumour. Ten out of 11 patients were children (aged between 5 and 16 years) with osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma of the pelvis (2 children) or the arm (8 children), and one patient was a 67-year-old lady with a chondrosarcoma of the pelvis. All underwent wide resections resulting in considerable bone defects necessitating further reconstruction. RESULTS Custom-made implants were extremely useful both in reconstruction of bone defects and in terms of cosmesis, recovery facilitation, and quality of life. In this respect, pelvic and humeral reconstructions with 3D-printed custom implants particularly showed a great potential. The mean follow-up was 33 months. Four patients died of disease (36%) and overall the major and minor complication rate was 54% (6 out of 11 patients). Three patients had implant dislocation (27% [3/11 cases]), one had leg-compartment syndrome, and one patient reported limited range of motion. Only two out of 11 patients developed local recurrence.

Interval breast cancer has a worse prognosis than cancers detected by screening; however, it is unknown whether the length of the interscreening period is associated with prognostic features and mortality. Objective To compare the prognostic features and mortality rate of women with IBCs diagnosed within 1 year or between 1 and 2.5 years of a mammogram with negative results with the prognostic features and mortality rate of women with breast cancers detected by screening. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study used mammography data, tumor characteristics, and patient demographic data from the Women's Health Initiative study, which recruited participants from 1993 to 1998 and followed up with participants for a median of 19 years. The present study sample for these analyses included women aged 50 to 79 years who participated in the Women's Health Initiative study and includes data collected through March 31, 2018. There were 5455 incidents of breast cancer; only 3019 women compliant with screening were retained in analyses. Statistical analysis was performed from October 25, 2018, to November 24, 2019. Breast cancers detected by screening and IBCs were defined based on mammogram history, date of last mammogram, type of visit, and results of examination. Interval breast cancers were subdivided into those occurring within 1 year or between 1 and 2.5 years after the last protocol-mandated mammogram with negative results. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome of this study was breast cancer-specific mortality for each case of breast cancer detected by screening and IBCs detected within 1 year or between 1 and 2.5 years from a mammogram with negative results. Secondary outcomes included prognostic and tumor characteristics for each group. Comparisons between groups were made using the t test, the χ2 test, and Fine-Gray multivariable cumulative incidence regression analyses. Results Among the 3019 participants in this analysis, all were women with a mean (SD) age of 63.1 (6.8) years at enrollment and 68.5 (7.1) years at diagnosis. A total of 1050 cases of IBC were identified, with 324 (30.9%) diagnosed within 1 year from a mammogram with negative results and 726 (69.1%) diagnosed between 1 and 2.5 years after last mammogram with negative results. The remaining 1969 cases were breast cancers detected by screening. Interval breast cancers diagnosed within 1 year from a mammogram with negative results had significantly more lobular histologic characteristics (13.0% vs. 8.1%), a larger tumor size (1.97 cm vs 1.43 cm), a higher clinical stage (28.4% vs 17.3% regional and 3.7% vs 0.6% distant), and more lymph node involvement (27.1% vs 17.0%) than cancers detected by screening. Unadjusted breast cancer-specific mortality hazard ratios were significantly higher for IBCs diagnosed within 1 year from a mammogram with negative results compared with breast cancers detected by screening (hazard ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.39-2.65). Higher breast cancer-specific mortality remained statistically significant for IBCs diagnosed within 1 year after adjusting for trial group, molecular subtype, waist to hip ratio, histologic characteristics, and either tumor size (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.03-2.08) or lymph node involvement (hazard ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.03-2.01). However, significance was lost when tumor size and lymph node involvement were both included in the model (hazard ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.96-1.88). Interval breast cancers diagnosed between 1 and 2.5 years from a mammogram with negative results were not different from breast cancers detected by screening based on prognostic factors or mortality. Conclusions and Relevance Women with IBCs diagnosed within 1 year of negative mammogram results overall were associated with worse survival than women with breast cancers detected by screening. These differences in survival may be due to a uniquely aggressive biology among IBC cases.","Irvin, Veronica L; Zhang, Zhenzhen; Simon, Michael S; Chlebowski, Rowan T; Luoh, Shiuh-Wen; Shadyab, Aladdin H; Krok-Schoen, Jessica L; Tabung, Fred K; Qi, Lihong; Stefanick, Marcia L; Schedin, Pepper; Jindal, Sonali",JAMA network open,255,17

METHOD AND RESULTS Patients with unilateral and isolated angle or condylar fractures were included in this retrospective, cross-sectional study. Data was collected from patient records and panoramic x-rays. The predictor variables included the type of occlusal support and the presence or absence of third molars. The outcome variable was angle or condylar fracture, while other predictor variables included demographic factors. Bivariate (χ2 test) and logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the associations between variables and the outcome. 43 angle (mean age: 29.9 ± 12.8 years; 98.4% male) and 37 condylar (mean age: 46.8 ± 20.2 years; 62.2% male) fracture cases were included in this study. Bilateral occlusal support was present in 81.4% of angle fracture group and in 51.3% of condylar fracture group (p<0.001). In the case of bilateral occlusal support, an odds ratio (OR) of 4.2 was found for angle fractures (p<0.006). A third molar was present in 86% of the angle fracture group and in 43.2% of the condylar fracture group (p<0.001). The presence of a third molar exhibited an odds ratio of 8.1 for the angle fractures (p<0.001). When bilateral occlusal support and third molar were present simultaneously, the risk was 15.9 times higher for an angle fracture (p<0.001). CONCLUSION The presence of occlusal support and/or third molars was significantly associated with angle fractures, however, the absence of occlusal support and/or third molars significantly correlated with condylar fractures.

It has been argued that identity impairment is one of the core features of BPD, which can be manifested in different ways, including fragmented autobiographical narratives. Here, we considered both the traditional and modern conceptualizations of BPD to examine the relation between identity impairment, as operationalized through autobiographical memory, and features of BPD. We hypothesized that BPD features would be associated with higher levels of fragmentation in narrative identity, narrative intimacy, and narrative coherence in participants' autobiographical memory. To test this hypothesis, we recruited 298 university students who were administered a series of self-report measures of BPD and were asked to describe an autobiographical memory about a turning point in their lives. Narrative identity, but not narrative intimacy nor coherence, was the dominant predictor of BPD features. We discuss our findings in terms of how individuals with features of BPD struggle with many aspects of a distorted sense of self.

However, some patients fail to recover even after recanalisation because of ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. We hypothesised that regional transarterial hypothermic infusion would be effective for patients with I/R injury. The aim of this study is to validate the safety of this procedure. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This is a clinical exploratory study to evaluate safety of regional transarterial hypothermic infusion in combination with endovascular thrombectomy. Patients with acute ischaemic stroke and a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 5-29 who require endovascular thrombectomy are eligible for the study. When no improvement in NIHSS score after the recanalisation is achieved by thrombectomy, cold saline (15°C) will be administered through a microcatheter located in the ipsilateral internal carotid artery. The primary endpoints of this study are mortality and morbidity. The secondary endpoint is deleterious effects on clinical data such as symptoms, radiographic findings and physiological data. The primary and secondary endpoints will be accumulated as case series because this study will be conducted on a small sample of seven patients.

IFITM3 gene variants have been associated with the clinical response to influenza and other viruses. Our aim was to determine whether the IFITM3 rs12252 polymorphism was associated with the risk of developing severe symptoms of COVID-19 in our population. METHODS A total of 288 COVID-19 patients who required hospitalization (81 in the intensive care unit) and 440 age matched controls were genotyped with a Taqman assay. Linear regression models were used to compare allele and genotype frequencies between the groups, correcting for age and sex. RESULTS Carriers of the minor allele frequency (rs12252 C) were significantly more frequent in the patients compared to controls after correcting by age and sex (p = 0.01, OR = 2.02, 95%CI = 1.19-3.42). This genotype was non-significantly more common among patients who required ICU. CONCLUSIONS The IFITM3 rs12252 C allele was a risk factor for COVID-19 hospitalization in our Caucasian population. The extent of the association was lower than the reported among Chinese, a population with a much higher frequency of the risk allele.","Gómez, Juan; Albaiceta, Guillermo M; Cuesta-Llavona, Elías; García-Clemente, Marta; López-Larrea, Carlos; Amado-Rodríguez, Laura; López-Alonso, Inés; Melón, Santiago; Alvarez-Argüelles, Marta E; Gil-Peña, Helena; Vidal-Castiñeira, José R; Corte-Iglesias, Viviana; Saiz, María L; Alvarez, Victoria; Coto, Eliecer",Cytokine,255,1

Communities require comprehensive timely data on violence to plan and implement effective violence prevention strategies. Emergency departments (EDs) can play an important role in violence prevention. EDs treat injuries associated with violent crime, and they are well-positioned to systematically collect information about these injuries, including the location where the injury occurred. The Cardiff Model for Violence Prevention (The Cardiff Model) provides a framework for interdisciplinary data collection and sharing. METHODS This paper uses the Diffusion of Innovation Theory as a framework to present our experiences of implementing the Cardiff Model in several EDs that serve the Milwaukee area, and to detail the processes of data collection, linking and presentation across four different hospital systems. RESULTS Implementing a city-wide data collection effort that involves multiple hospital systems is challenging. Viewing our findings through the lens of the Diffusion of Innovations theory provides a way to anticipate facilitators and challenges to Cardiff Model implementation in a hospital setting. CONCLUSIONS Facilitators and barriers to Cardiff Model adoption in the ED setting can be understood using the Diffusion of Innovation theory, and barriers can be interrupted through careful planning and continuous communication between partners.","Kohlbeck, Sara; Levas, Michael; Hernandez-Meier, Jennifer; Hargarten, Stephen",Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention,255,1

Currently, everyone in Europe is covered by GDPR. Thus, the medical practice also requires access to patient data in a safe and secure way. METHODS Holographic technology allows users to see everything visible ona computer screen in a new and less restricted way, i. e. without the limitations of traditional computers and screens. RESULTS In this study, a three-dimensional holographic doctors' assistant is designed and implemented in a way that meets the GDPR requirements. The HoloView application, which is tailored to run on Microsoft HoloLens, is proposed toallow display and access to personal data and so-called sensitive information of all individual patients without the risk that it will be presented to unauthorized persons. CONCLUSIONS To enhance the user experience and remain consistent with GSPR, a holographic desk is proposed that allows displaying patient data and sensitive information only in front of the doctor's eyes using mixed reality glasses.

The World Health Organization recommends 150 min of moderate exercise per week for older adults to achieve these health benefits. However, only 20-60 % of adults aged 60 years and above currently meet these recommendations for exercise. The widespread use of the internet and mobile phones among older adults may open new opportunities to promote PA in this population. Findings of previous reviews suggest that eHealth interventions are effective in promoting PA in adults of various ages. However, to date, none of these reviews have provided a differentiated picture of engagement in such interventions and effects on PA among older adults. Also, we are unaware of any studies comparing effects of participation in eHealth vs. traditional paper-and-pencil interventions on PA in this population. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to compare the effectiveness of eHealth interventions promoting PA in older adults aged 55 years and above with either a non-eHealth PA intervention or a group that is not exposed to any intervention. METHODS Eight electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, PEI, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and OpenGrey) will be searched to identify experimental and quasi-experimental studies examining the effectiveness of eHealth interventions for PA promotion in adults aged 55 years and above. Two authors will independently select and review references, extract data, and assess the quality of the included studies by using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. Disagreements between authors will be resolved by discussion involving a third author. If feasible, a meta-analysis will be conducted. Narrative synthesis using harvest plots will be performed, should a meta-analysis not be feasible. DISCUSSION The proposed systematic review will be the first review that compares the effectiveness of eHealth interventions promoting PA in older adults aged 55 years and above with control groups exposed to a non-eHealth intervention or to no intervention. The results of this review will provide new information regarding the question whether eHealth interventions are an effective intervention vehicle for PA promotion in this population.

We describe here the development of an unobtrusive, open-source, scalable, and user-friendly architecture for collecting, transmitting, and storing mechanical ventilator waveform data that is generalizable to other patient care devices. The system implements a software framework that automates and enforces end-to-end data collection and transmission. A web-based data management application facilitates nontechnical end users' abilities to manage data acquisition devices, mitigates data loss and misattribution, and automates data storage. Using this integrated system, we have been able to collect ventilator waveform data from >450 patients as part of an ongoing clinical study.","Rehm, Gregory B; Kuhn, Brooks T; Delplanque, Jean-Pierre; Guo, Edward C; Lieng, Monica K; Nguyen, Jimmy; Anderson, Nicholas R; Adams, Jason Y",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,255,1

Forty Wistar albino rats were used, divided into four random groups. The rats underwent a midline laparotomy, and a partial omentectomy was performed using a 3-0 silk suture with suture ligation in group 1, bipolar device in group 2, and ultrasonic coagulator in group 3; only a laparotomy was performed on the control group. Lateral thermal damage was examined the same day, and a piece of the omentum was left in the animals to be examined on postoperative day 15. A relaparotomy was performed to assess adhesion formation and histopathological response. In pairwise comparisons, there was no statistically significant difference among the ultrasonic device, bipolar device, and suture ligation groups in terms of microscopic adhesion scoring; however, the scores of the bipolar device and suture ligation groups were significantly higher compared with those of the control group (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the macroscopic adhesion scores were significantly lower for the ultrasonic device group when compared with those of the bipolar device and suture ligation groups (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01).

While the well-known poly-ADP-ribosylating (PARylating) PARPs primarily function in the DNA damage response, many non-canonical mono-ADP-ribosylating (MARylating) PARPs are associated with cellular antiviral responses. We recently demonstrated robust upregulation of several PARPs following infection with Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV), a model coronavirus. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection strikingly upregulates MARylating PARPs and induces the expression of genes encoding enzymes for salvage NAD synthesis from nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinamide riboside (NR), while downregulating other NAD biosynthetic pathways. We show that overexpression of PARP10 is sufficient to depress cellular NAD and that the activities of the transcriptionally induced enzymes PARP7, PARP10, PARP12 and PARP14 are limited by cellular NAD and can be enhanced by pharmacological activation of NAD synthesis. We further demonstrate that infection with MHV induces a severe attack on host cell NAD+ and NADP+ Finally, we show that NAMPT activation, NAM and NR dramatically decrease the replication of an MHV virus that is sensitive to PARP activity. These data suggest that the antiviral activities of noncanonical PARP isozyme activities are limited by the availability of NAD, and that nutritional and pharmacological interventions to enhance NAD levels may boost innate immunity to coronaviruses.","Heer, Collin D; Sanderson, Daniel J; Voth, Lynden S; Alhammad, Yousef M O; Schmidt, Mark S; Trammell, Samuel A J; Perlman, Stanley; Cohen, Michael S; Fehr, Anthony R; Brenner, Charles",The Journal of biological chemistry,255,1

To investigate the effect of SIV and Bbr coinfection on cytokine and viral RNA expression, we performed a study in which pigs were inoculated with SIV, Bbr or both pathogens (SIV/Bbr). Our results indicate that Bbr infection alters SIV clearance. Pulmonary lesions in the SIV/Bbr group were more severe when compared to SIV or Bbr groups and Bbr did not cause significant lesions. Broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was examined for inflammatory mediators by qPCR. Interferon (IFN)-α, interleukin IL-8, IL-1 peaked in BALF at 2 DPI, while the virus titres and severity of clinical signs were maximal at the same time. Despite its increased expression in co-infected pigs, interferon-α did not enhance SIV clearance, since the viral replication was detected at the same day as the highest IFN levels. The mRNA levels for IFN-α, IL-1β and IL-8 were significantly higher in BALF of co-infected pigs and correlated with enhanced viral RNA titers in lungs, trachea and nasal swabs. Transcription of mRNA for IL-1β was stable in SIV and SIV/Bbr groups throughout all the study. In Bbr group, the levels of mRNAs for IL-1β were significantly higher at 2, 4 and 9 DPI. The mean levels of mRNAs for TNF-α were lower than the levels of other chemokines and cytokines in all infected groups. Transcript levels of IL-10 and IL-4 did not increase at each time points. Overall, SIV replication was increased by Bbr presence and the enhanced production of pro-inflammatory mediators could contribute to the exacerbated pulmonary lesions.","Kowalczyk, Andrzej; Pomorska-Mól, Małgorzata; Kwit, Krzysztof; Pejsak, Zygmunt; Rachubik, Jarosław; Markowska-Daniel, Iwona",Veterinary microbiology,255,20

The relationships between anemia and nutrition are complex being evident with compromised general health and nutrition. Increased micronutrient intakes, especially iron and folic acid, has alleviated the problem, but encouraged nutrient-specific micronutrient interventions as attractive policy directions as if anemia were a stand-alone disease irrespective of associated disorder. Concerted action to deal with the fundamental causality has been missing. Much of the pathogenetic pathway may be nutritional, but its multifactoriality is ultimately socioecological. Given the intransigence and progression of societal and ecosystem dysfunction, it can be expected that failure to recognize their causal importance will further entrench endemic anemia.

Underlying socio-ecological problems are livelihood, food systems, cultural habits, belief systems, and social networks and activities. With this framework, policy directions could deal more comprehensively and effectively with the socioecological complexity which underpins and limits progress towards anemia eradication at a time of intense global food and health insecurity. It will require co-operative intersectoral and eco-nutritional approaches which take into account the need for universal, sustainable livelihoods.

We use data from counties in the United States to identify if community level responses to COVID-19 during the early phase of the pandemic (February 17 - May 10) depended on levels of social capital. We find that individuals who lived in counties with high levels of social capital reduced mobility faster than individuals living in counties with low levels of social capital and that they especially reduced mobility directed at retail and recreational activities, i.e. non-essential activities with higher potential risk. Difference-in-difference results show that the adoption of shelter-in-place orders (SIPOs) in a county, an increase in the number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases and a rainy weather were all associated with a decline in mobility, but that effects were heterogenous and depended on community level social capital. Effects were more pronounced in high social capital communities. Based on these findings, we map the level of vulnerability of communities in the United States to COVID-19: counties with a large share of the population suffering from pre-existing medical conditions and low levels of community level social capital are especially susceptible to experiencing severe health outcomes because of COVID-19.","Borgonovi, Francesca; Andrieu, Elodie",Social science & medicine,255,16

In this study, we evaluated whether imaging with sst antagonists was feasible in patients. METHODS Biodistribution and tumor uptake of the sst antagonist (111)In-DOTA-pNO(2)-Phe-c(DCys-Tyr-DTrp-Lys-Thr-Cys)DTyrNH(2) ((111)In-DOTA-BASS) were studied in 5 patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma or neuroendocrine tumors. Findings were compared with (111)In-pentetreotid ((111)In-DTPA-octreotide) scan. RESULTS No adverse effects of (111)In-DOTA-BASS (20 μg) were observed. (111)In-DOTA-BASS detected 25 of 28 lesions, whereas (111)In-DTPA-octreotide detected only 17 of 28 lesions. In the same patient, (111)In-DOTA-BASS showed higher tumor and lower renal uptake than (111)In-DTPA-octreotide (3.5 ± 2.8 percentage injected activity [%IA] vs. 1.0 ± 0.99%IA and 1.5 ± 0.3 %IA vs. 2.3 ± 0.7 %IA) at 4 h after injection. CONCLUSION Imaging of neuroendocrine tumors with sst antagonists is clinically feasible. The favorable human biodistribution data suggest that sst antagonists could significantly affect peptide receptor-mediated imaging and therapy.","Wild, Damian; Fani, Melpomeni; Behe, Martin; Brink, Ingo; Rivier, Jean E F; Reubi, Jean Claude; Maecke, Helmut R; Weber, Wolfgang A","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",255,16

Even in cases of complex resection, as in the case reported here, the procedure can be performed safely after careful pre-operative planning. This video tutorial describes our technique for the intrapericardial isolation of the left inferior pulmonary vein in a patient affected by a left lower lobe metastasis from a colonic carcinoma. The lesion was retracting the inferior vein to such an extent that an intrapericardial approach was required in order to obtain a radical resection. The operation was carried out using a 3-port technique to allow for safe and unhindered manipulation of the hilar structures and the parenchyma. The pericardial sac was easily opened and the feasibility of the procedure was readily confirmed. The patient made an uneventful recovery; specifically, we did not record any arrhythmia or hemodynamic instability.

We examined exhaled air dispersion during HFNC therapy versus continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on a human patient simulator (HPS) in an isolation room with 16 air changes·h-1. METHODS The HPS was programmed to represent different severity of lung injury. CPAP was delivered at 5-20 cmH2O via nasal pillows (Respironics Nuance Pro Gel or ResMed Swift FX) or an oronasal mask (ResMed Quattro Air). HFNC, humidified to 37°C, was delivered at 10-60 L·min-1 to the HPS. Exhaled airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke for visualisation and revealed by laser light-sheet. Normalised exhaled air concentration was estimated from the light scattered by the smoke particles. Significant exposure was defined when there was ≥20% normalised smoke concentration. RESULTS In the normal lung condition, mean±sd exhaled air dispersion, along the sagittal plane, increased from 186±34 to 264±27 mm and from 207±11 to 332±34 mm when CPAP was increased from 5 to 20 cmH2O via Respironics and ResMed nasal pillows, respectively. Leakage from the oronasal mask was negligible. Mean±sd exhaled air distances increased from 65±15 to 172±33 mm when HFNC was increased from 10 to 60 L·min-1. Air leakage to 620 mm occurred laterally when HFNC and the interface tube became loose. CONCLUSION Exhaled air dispersion during HFNC and CPAP via different interfaces is limited provided there is good mask interface fitting.","Hui, David S; Chow, Benny K; Lo, Thomas; Tsang, Owen T Y; Ko, Fanny W; Ng, Susanna S; Gin, Tony; Chan, Matthew T V",The European respiratory journal,255,24

The objective of this study was to evaluate a community pharmacist AKI education programme aimed at patient self-management during acute dehydrating illnesses. METHODS This was a multimethod study. Potential participants were identified by community pharmacists when they presented a prescription containing a study medicine. The intervention consisted of completion of a short demographic questionnaire and a pharmacist providing verbal AKI information and advice on self-management during acute dehydrating illness, including medicine withholding. This information was supported with take-home information. Participants were telephoned between 4 and 11 months later and invited to participate in a structured telephone interview. Descriptive statistics were generated from questionnaire responses, and interview data were analysed using manifest content analysis. KEY FINDINGS One hundred and thirteen adults were recruited and 93 (82%) interviewed. Fifty-four (58%) interviewees remembered the pharmacist's education, and 51 (55%) had retained the information sheet. Fifty-eight (62%) would temporarily withhold medicines during acute dehydrating illnesses. Thirty-nine were comfortable they knew when to restart their medicines; 15 (38%) indicated this was once symptom-free for 48 h. Forty-six interviewees were comfortable about contacting their general practice; 16 (35%) would do this after 24 h of illness. Participants found the educational content and pharmacist approach acceptable. CONCLUSION A majority of participants accepted and remembered the information provided by their community pharmacist and felt comfortable to self-manage during acute dehydrating illness. A caveat is participant actions in practice may not be consistent with stated intentions.","Vicary, Dianne; Hutchison, Colin; Aspden, Trudi",The International journal of pharmacy practice,255,27

CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 64-year-old woman, with visual deficit, harboring a large wide-necked aneurysm located at the junction between left internal carotid artery and left A1 segment of anterior cerebral artery, was submitted to endovascular treatment. As she had pre-existing occlusion of left internal carotid, approach from the contralateral internal carotid was used to advance the pipeline embolization device through the anterior communicating artery and place the flow diverter horizontally across the neck (from M1 to A1). Coil embolization was also performed through a microcatheter navigated via posterior communicating artery. The intervention was uneventful, with total aneurysm occlusion. Patient presented with visual improvement on follow-up. CONCLUSION Horizontal deployment of pipeline embolization device appears to be an acceptable and feasible alternative to treat internal carotid bifurcation aneurysms.

Starting in December 2019 from China, the first cases were officially announced on February 19 in Qom city, Iran. As of April 3, 2020, 206 countries have reported a total of 932166 cases with 46764 deaths. Along with China, USA, Italy, Spain, and Germany, Iran has been suffering the hardest burden of COVID-19 outbreak. Worse still, countries like Iran are struggling with the double burden of political sanctions to provide lifesaving medical equipment and medicines to combat the emergency. METHODS Using systematic document content analysis and through the lenses of health policy triangle, this article aims to compare the policies and strategies that Iran is adopting, with the experience and recommendations of China and WHO to combat COVID-19. RESULTS Iran has formulated contextual-based policies to combat COVID-19 outbreak before and after virus entrance. Insufficient whole-government, whole-society approach in managing the outbreak, inadequate lifesaving and protective equipment, and delayed decisive governance are the biggest challenges in policy making to combat COVID-19. COVID-19 policies are a public health concern and require professional advocacy attempts through appropriate inter-sectoral collaboration and whole-government coalitions. CONCLUSION COVID-19 is an unfolding outbreak; hence, policy learning is crucial to formulate appropriate policies and implement them accordingly. Iran has made many efforts to defeat the outbreak, but more coherent, timely and efficient action is required, now, more than ever, to save lives and slow the spread of this pandemic.","Raoofi, Azam; Takian, Amirhossein; Akbari Sari, Ali; Olyaeemanesh, Alireza; Haghighi, Hajar; Aarabi, Mohsen",Archives of Iranian medicine,255,16

Although the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown by pooled analyses from randomized controlled trials, elderly patients still receive adjuvant chemotherapy less frequently than younger patients. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to assess the survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in elderly patients based on observational studies in which the elderly patients would likely be representative of those encountered in real-world clinical settings. METHODS A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Observational studies that investigated the survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy after curative resection in elderly patients (age ≥ 70 years) with colon or rectal cancer were included. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate and OS were assessed. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool. RESULTS Eleven studies in elderly patients with colon cancer were included. No relevant study was identified for rectal cancer. Elderly patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy had a significantly higher 5-year OS rate than those who did not (risk ratio 1.51, 95% confidence interval 1.29-1.76, P < 0.001). There was also a significant improvement in OS in elderly patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.53-0.66, P < 0.001). The overall risk of bias was judged to be critical for both outcomes. CONCLUSION Adjuvant chemotherapy provides a survival benefit for elderly patients with colon cancer, although the quality of evidence is low.","Hoshino, Nobuaki; Aoyama, Ryuhei; Hida, Koya",International journal of clinical oncology,255,1

To achieve robust antitumor efficacy, mRNA-encoding tumor antigens needs to be efficiently delivered and translated in dendritic cells for efficient antigen presentation; meanwhile, the vaccine would have adjuvant effect by stimulating innate immune response to boost the full activation of adaptive immunity. Recently, we reported a minimalist nanovaccine by formulating tumor antigen-encoding mRNA with a lipid-like material named C1, which could efficiently deliver mRNA into dendritic cells with simultaneous Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) stimulation, together induced T cell activation. Importantly, C1 mRNA nanovaccine exhibited significant antitumor efficacy on several tumor mouse models.

However, little is known on local farmers' awareness of the potential risks, and how they perceive the role played by wildlife in the epidemiology of these diseases. We investigated the knowledge base regarding livestock diseases of local cattle owners living at the periphery of conservation areas within the Great Limpopo TFCA and the Kavango-Zambezi TFCA in Zimbabwe, using free-listing and semi-structured questionnaires during dipping sessions. The results suggest that information related to cattle diseases circulates widely between cattle farmers, including between different socio-cultural groups, using English and vernacular languages. Most respondents had an accurate perception of the epidemiology of diseases affecting their livestock, and their perception of the potential role played by wildlife species was usually in agreement with current state of veterinary knowledge. However, we found significant variations in the cultural importance of livestock diseases between sites, and owners' perceptions were not directly related with the local abundance of wildlife. As the establishment of TFCAs will potentially increase the risk of Transboundary Animal Diseases, we recommend an increased participation of communities at a local level in the prioritisation of livestock diseases control and surveillance, including zoonoses.","de Garine-Wichatitsky, M; Miguel, E; Mukamuri, B; Garine-Wichatitsky, E; Wencelius, J; Pfukenyi, D M; Caron, A","Comparative immunology, microbiology and infectious diseases",255,30

A total of 81 pacu juveniles (61.7 ± 9.1 g) were exposed to three temperatures (18, 23, and 28 °C), acclimated for a period of 30 days, and then submitted to three levels of dissolved oxygen: control or normoxia (7 mg L-1); moderate hypoxia (4 mg L-1); and severe hypoxia (2 mg L-1) for 12 h. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity, total antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP), and protein thiol content (PSH) and LPO (lipid peroxidation) [measured by the TBARS] were measured in gill, liver, muscle and brain. The results indicated that the interaction between different temperatures and dissolved oxygen levels caused alterations in the antioxidant system and induced lipid and protein damage in pacu juveniles. In addition, the effects were organ specific. In conclusion, exposure to moderate and severe hypoxia affect oxidative stress parameters and have been shown to be organ-specific in pacu juveniles.

Experimental and observational studies reporting the association between GV and mood in adults with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes were evaluated. A descriptive analysis of the extracted data was conducted, along with a quality assessment. Results Out of the 2.316 studies screened, eight studies met our criteria. Studies used a variety of measures and metrics to determine GV and mood. Four studies used continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). An association between GV and mood was found in four studies when correlating either postprandial glucose rate of increase with current mood or multiday GV with mood measured retrospectively. The other four studies did not find any association. Conclusions There is no clear empirical support for a link between GV and mood in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Prolonged MV induces diaphragmatic dysfunction in non-septic animals, but few reports describe the effects of prolonged MV in sepsis. We hypothesized that prolonged MV is not protective but worsens the diaphragmatic dysfunction induced by a mild sepsis, because MV and sepsis share key signaling mechanisms, such as cytokine upregulation. METHOD We studied the impact of prolonged MV (12 h) in four groups (n = 8) of male Wistar rats: 1) endotoxemia induced by intraperitoneal injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, 2) MV without endotoxemia, 3) combination of endotoxemia and MV and 4) sham control. Diaphragm mechanical performance, pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations (Tumor Necrosis Factor-α, Interleukin-1β, Interleukin-6) in plasma were measured. RESULTS Prolonged MV and sepsis independtly reduced maximum diaphragm force (-27%, P = 0.003; -37%, P<0.001; respectively). MV and sepsis acted additively to further decrease diaphragm force (-62%, P<0.001). Similar results were observed for diaphragm kinetics (maximum lengthening velocity -47%, P<0.001). Sepsis and MV reduced diaphragm cross sectional area of type I and IIx fibers, which was further increased by the combination of sepsis and MV (all P<0.05). Sepsis and MV were individually associated with the presence of a robust perimysial inflammatory infiltrate, which was more marked when sepsis and MV were both present (all P<0.05). Sepsis and, to a lesser extent, MV increased proinflammatory cytokine production in plasma and diaphragm (all P<0.05); proinflammatory cytokine expression in plasma was increased further by the combination of sepsis and MV (all P<0.05). Maximum diaphragm force correlated negatively with plasma and diaphragmatic cytokine production (all p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Prolonged (12 h) MV exacerbated sepsis-induced decrease in diaphragm performance.

Healthcare workers are the front liners of pandemic management. Their knowledge, attitudes and practices can influence the outcome of pandemic. The study aims to determine the knowledge, attitude and practices among healthcare workers. METHODS Knowledge, attitude and practice related questionnaire based online survey through Google forms was conducted from Healthcare workers, following ethical approval from NHRC (ERB protocol registration number: 297/2020 P). Online forms were disseminated via Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, Viber and personal messaging. Responses containing anonymized data was collected analyzed in using SPSS-version 26, (Year: 2019). The results were interpreted in terms of percentage response, knowledge score, and practice and discussed on the possible solutions in improving the infection prevention and control practice. RESULTS 473 HCWs responded to the questionnaire, out of which 426 responses met inclusion criteria which is 90% of the total responses. The mean score for knowledge was 3.20 + 1.15 out of maximum seven; with 45.7% correct answers. 70.4 % (300) participants felt that Nepal will be unable to contain the pandemic, 64 % of the total employed participants felt that there was inadequate institutional preparedness to protect HCWs from exposure. 91% participants reported practicing hand hygiene after every patient encounter; whereas 31.7% (77) and 22.1% (59) participants did not know how to check sealing of the N95 masks and use personal protective equipment's respectively.

Major concerns over personal hygiene, mandated and ease in lockdown actions and slackening of some policy measures have led to a massive surge in the use of disposable personal protective equipment (PPE) and other single-use plastic items. This generated an enormous amount of plastic waste from both healthcare and household units, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Apart from the healthcare workers, the general public have become accustomed to using PPE. These habits are threatening the land and marine environment with immense loads of plastic waste, due to improper disposal practices across the world, especially in developing nations.

This study provided an estimation-based approach in quantifying the amount of contaminated plastic waste that can be expected daily from the massive usage of PPE (e.g. facemasks) because of the countrywide mandated regulations on PPE usage. The situation of Bangladesh has been analysed and projections revealed that a total of 3.4 billion pieces of single-use facemask, hand sanitizer bottles, hand gloves and disposable polyethylene bags will be produced monthly, which will give rise to 472.30 t of disposable plastic waste per day. The equations provided for the quantification of waste from used single-use plastic and PPE can be used for other countries for rough estimations. Then, the discussed recommendations will help concerned authorities and policy makers to design effective response plans. Sustainable plastic waste management for the current and post-pandemic period can be imagined and acted upon.","Haque, Md Sazzadul; Sharif, Shafkat; Masnoon, Aseer; Rashid, Ebne","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",255,1

Some peptides have been shown to translocate across the membrane spontaneously, and they could be thus used as drug-carriers. However, the advantageous peptide properties for the translocation remain unclear. Of particular interest is the effect of a proline-induced kink in α-helical peptides, because the kink was previously reported to both increase and decrease the antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobial activity of peptides could be related to their translocation across the membrane as is the case of the buforin 2 peptide investigated here. Using computer simulations with two independent models, we consistently showed that the presence of the kink has (1) no effect on the translocation barrier, (2) reduces the peptide affinity to the membrane, and (3) disfavors the transmembrane state. Moreover, we were able to determine that these effects are mainly caused by the peptide increased polarity, not the increased flexibility of the kink. The provided molecular understanding can be utilized for the design of cell-penetrating and drug-carrying peptides.","Brožek, Radim; Kabelka, Ivo; Vácha, Robert",The journal of physical chemistry.

Few studies describe the effects of CI-AKI in a large-scale acute coronary syndrome population, and the relationship between CI-AKI and bleeding events has not been extensively explored. We sought to evaluate the impact of CI-AKI after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS We pooled patient-level data for 9512 patients from the percutaneous coronary intervention cohorts of the Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) and Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy (ACUITY) multicenter randomized trials. Patients were classified according to CI-AKI development, and cardiovascular outcomes at 30 days and 1 year were compared between groups. A total of 1212 patients (12.7%) developed CI-AKI. Patients with CI-AKI were older, with a more extensive comorbidity profile than without CI-AKI. Multivariable analysis confirmed several previously identified predictors of CI-AKI, including diabetes mellitus, contrast volume, age, and baseline hemoglobin. Mortality rates were significantly higher in the CI-AKI group at 30 days (4.9% versus 0.7%; P<0.0001) and 1 year (9.8% versus 2.9%; P<0.0001), as were rates of 1-year myocardial infarction, definite/probable stent thrombosis, target lesion revascularization, and major adverse cardiac events. Major bleeding (13.8% versus 5.4%; hazard ratio, 2.64; 95% confidence interval, 2.21-3.15; P<0.0001) was also higher in patients with CI-AKI. After multivariable adjustment, results were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS CI-AKI after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome is independently associated with increased risk of short- and long-term ischemic and hemorrhagic events.

The present study aimed to investigate the clinical value and functional role of CELSR3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and determine the underlying molecular mechanism in patients with HCC. CELSR3 expression in tumor and paracancerous HCC tissues was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Differential expression analysis was performed using the edgeR package. Pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between methylation and mRNA levels of CELSR3. Pathways affected by aberrant CELSR3 expression were identified through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. The results demonstrated that CELSR3 was highly expressed in the early stage of cancer and was present throughout the entire cancer process, which suggested that CELSR3 may serve a key role in the carcinogenesis of HCC. In addition, upregulation of CELSR3 was associated with its methylation level; high CELSR3 expression indicated a shorter overall survival time. Multiple candidate genes were screened by integrating differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs and target genes of DE microRNAs (miRs). Subsequent pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that the upregulated genes were predominantly enriched in the 'Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction' and 'Cell cycle' pathways, whereas the downregulated genes were primarily enriched in 'Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction' and 'Metabolic pathways'. CELSR3 and its connected nodes and edges were initially removed from the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network in order to prevent bias and compared with the network containing CELSR3 alone. The frequently dysregulated miRNAs were identified as miR-181 family members, and the results suggested that miR-181 and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway influenced CELSR3 expression.","Ouyang, Xiwu; Wang, Zhiming; Yao, Lei; Zhang, Gewen",Oncology letters,255,31

We hypothesized that supply acquisition at non-profit organization (NPO) costs would lead to significant cost-savings compared with supply acquisition at US academic institution costs from the provider perspective for hernia repairs and minor procedures during a surgical mission in the Dominican Republic. METHODS Items acquired for a surgical mission were uniquely QR-coded for accurate consumption accounting. Both NPO and US academic institution unit costs were associated with each item in an electronic inventory system. Medication doses were recorded and QR codes for consumed items were scanned into a record for each sampled procedure. Mean material costs and cost-savings ± SDs were calculated in US dollars for each procedure type. Cost-minimization analyses between the NPO and the US academic institution platforms for each procedure type ensued using a two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs test with α = 0.05. Item utilization analyses generated lists of most frequently used materials by procedure type. RESULTS The mean cost-savings of supply acquisition at NPO costs for each procedure type were as follows: $482.86 ± $683.79 for unilateral inguinal hernia repair (n = 13); $332.46 ± $184.09 for bilateral inguinal hernia repair (n = 3); $127.26 ± $13.18 for hydrocelectomy (n = 9); $232.92 ± $56.49 for femoral hernia repair (n = 3); $120.90 ± $30.51 for umbilical hernia repair (n = 8); $36.59 ± $17.76 for minor procedures (n = 26); and $120.66 ± $14.61 for pediatric inguinal hernia repair (n = 7). CONCLUSION Supply acquisition at NPO costs leads to significant cost-savings compared with supply acquisition at US academic institution costs from the provider perspective for inguinal hernia repair, hydrocelectomy, umbilical hernia repair, minor procedures, and pediatric inguinal hernia repair during a surgical mission in the Dominican Republic. Item utilization analysis can generate minimum-necessary material lists for each procedure type to reproduce cost-savings for subsequent missions.","Cavallo, Jaime A; Ousley, Jenny; Barrett, Christopher D; Baalman, Sara; Ward, Kyle; Borchardt, Malgorzata; Thomas, J Ross; Perotti, Gary; Frisella, Margaret M; Matthews, Brent D",Surgical endoscopy,255,1

The global prevalence of IBS is estimated to be as high as 15%. For many patients, IBS is a chronic disorder which can significantly reduce quality of life. Just as important as the effects on any one individual, IBS also places a significant impact on the population as a whole with its negative effects on the health care system. Irritable bowel syndrome is categorized into one of three main categories: IBS with diarrhea, IBS with constipation, and IBS with mixed bowel habits. Patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) comprise a substantial proportion of the overall IBS population. A number of therapeutic options exist to treat the symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and fecal urgency, including non-pharmacologic therapies such as dietary changes and probiotics, or pharmacologic therapies such as loperamide and alosetron. However, many patients have persistent symptoms despite these therapies. This unmet need led to the development of eluxadoline, a mu-opioid receptor agonist/delta-opioid receptor antagonist/kappa-receptor agonist. Approved by the FDA in May 2015, this medication shows promise in the treatment of diarrhea-predominant IBS for both men and women. PURPOSE This monograph will briefly review the impact of IBS, discuss current treatments for IBS-D, and then focus on the pharmacology, clinical efficacy and safety of eluxadoline. Potential mechanisms related to rare events of acute pancreatitis or elevated liver tests will be discussed.","Lacy, B E",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,255,11

Government requirements to stay at home and avoid social and school settings may impact psychological well-being by modifying various behaviors such as problematic phone and Internet use, yet there is a paucity of research on this issue. This study examined whether the COVID-19 outbreak may have impacted problematic smartphone use (PSU), problematic gaming (PG), and psychological distress, specifically the pattern of relationships between PSU, PG, and psychological distress in schoolchildren. METHODS Longitudinal data on psychological distress, PSU, and PG were collected from 575 children in primary schools in 3 waves: Waves 1 and 2 were conducted before the COVID-19 outbreak and Wave 3 during the outbreak. Cross-lagged panel models were used to examine relationships between factors across the 3 waves. RESULTS Cross-lagged models found that higher levels of PSU were not significantly related prospectively to greater psychological distress before the COVID-19 outbreak, but this prospective relationship became significant during the COVID-19 outbreak. Whereas PG was associated prospectively with psychological distress before the COVID-19 outbreak (ie, between Waves 1 and 2), this association became nonsignificant during the COVID-19 lockdown (ie, between Waves 2 and 3). CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 outbreak has seemed to change prospective relationships between PSU and psychological distress and PG and psychological distress in schoolchildren. Future research should examine whether restrictions on or information provided to schoolchildren may exacerbate PSUs effects on psychological distress.","Chen, Chao-Ying; Chen, I-Hua; Hou, Wen-Li; Potenza, Marc N; O'Brien, Kerry S; Lin, Chung-Ying; Latner, Janet D",Journal of addiction medicine,255,1

Literature is beginning to suggest that these behaviours may be conducted automatically, although the instigation (deciding to do) and execution ('doing') of these behaviours has never been examined separately. The objective of this study was to test a theoretically informed supposition that oral hygiene behaviours in adults are automatic behaviours. METHODS One hundred and fifty participants attending three types of dental providers covering emergency and routine dental services, completed a questionnaire. The self-reported behavioural automaticity index scale (SRBAI) was used to measure behavioural automaticity. RESULTS Morning toothbrushing SRBAI scores were higher than evening scores (Z=-3.315, p = 0.001). Automaticity scores for instigating both toothbrushing and interdental cleaning were also higher compared to execution (toothbrushing: Z=-2.601, p = 0.009 and interdental cleaning: Z=-2.256. p = 0.024). Toothbrushing automaticity scores were associated with age, gender and self-efficacy, whereas interdental cleaning automaticity scores were associated with intention. Individuals in lower socio-economic status (SES) occupations had significantly higher automaticity scores for interdental cleaning compared to those with higher SES roles. CONCLUSIONS A high proportion of people undertake toothbrushing and interdental cleaning automatically, especially in relation to embarking on these behaviours. This is most pronounced in morning toothbrushing.","Raison, M H; Corcoran, R; Burnside, G; Harris, R V",Journal of dentistry,255,16

Although a few of these studies have compared costs, none has reported on the costs of hand-assisted colectomy performed in the US. Our aim was to determine the short-term outcomes and direct costs associated with hand-assisted and laparoscopic-assisted colectomy performed in the US. STUDY DESIGN One hundred hand-assisted laparoscopic colectomies were matched to 100 laparoscopic-assisted colectomies performed concurrently. Matching criteria were age (+/- 10 years), gender, diagnosis, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, earlier abdominal operation, colectomy type, and conversion. Operative time, morbidity, length of stay, reoperation, and readmission were assessed. Direct costs for the operating room, nursing care, intensive care, anesthesia, laboratory, pharmacy, radiology, emergency services and consultations, and professional and ancillary services related to the initial hospitalization and readmissions were compared. RESULTS From June 2005 to August 2008, 176 hand-assisted and 845 laparoscopic-assisted segmental and total colectomies were performed. Of 100 matched hand-assisted and laparoscopic-assisted patients, there were no differences in body mass index (29 and 28, respectively), operating time (168 and 163 minutes, respectively), length of stay (4 days), readmission (6% and 11%, respectively), or reoperation rates (5% and 9%, respectively). Overall morbidity was 16% and 32% for hand-assisted and laparoscopic-assisted colectomy, respectively (p = 0.009). Major morbidity, including abscess, hemorrhage, and anastomotic leak, were similar. Operating room costs were increased for hand-assisted colectomy (3,476 versus 3,167 US dollars); total costs were similar (8,521 versus 8,373 US dollars).

The impact of obesity on AL rates is debated. This meta-analysis aims to investigate the relationship between obesity and AL. METHODS A search was conducted of the PubMed/MEDLINE, and Web of Science databases and included studies were split into Western and Asian groups based on population-specific body mass index (BMI) ranges for obesity. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the impact of obesity on AL rate following colorectal cancer resection. RESULTS Two thousand three hundred and four articles were initially screened. Thirty-one studies totaling 32,953 patients were included. Patients with obesity had a statistically significant increase in AL rate in all Western and Asian study groups. However, this increase was only clinically significant in the rectal anastomotic subgroups-Western: 10.8% vs 8.4%, OR 1.57 (1.01-2.44) and Asian: 9.4% vs 7.4%, OR 1.58 (1.07-2.32). CONCLUSIONS The findings of this analysis confirm that obesity is a significant risk factor for anastomotic leak, particularly in rectal anastomoses. This effect is thought to be primarily mediated via technical difficulties of surgery although metabolic and immunological factors may also play a role. Obesity in patients undergoing restorative CRC resection should be discussed and considered as part of the pre-operative counselling.","Nugent, Timothy S; Kelly, Michael E; Donlon, Noel E; Fahy, Matthew R; Larkin, John O; McCormick, Paul H; Mehigan, Brian J",International journal of colorectal disease,255,12

Thoracoscopic right middle lung lobectomy was performed in ten dogs divided into ISO and TIVA groups, and cardiopulmonary parameters were measured with blood gas analysis. Throughout the study, isoflurane was inhaled up to 1.5%, and the infusion rates of propofol and remifentanil were 0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg/min and 6 to 11 µg/kg/h, respectively. Cardiac index was not affected in the ISO group, but it increased during 1LV in the TIVA group. There were significant alterations in arterial oxygen pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, oxygen content, and shunt fraction associated with 1LV in each group. However, oxygen delivery did not decrease significantly due to open chest condition, 1LV, or surgical maneuver in either group, rather it increased during 1LV in the TIVA group. All parameters showed no significant difference between groups. Pulmonary vascular resistant index was unaffected in both groups, and there was no difference between groups except in re-ventilation phase.

Pre-stroke depression may be an important contributor, however the epidemiology of pre-stroke depression is poorly understood. Using systematic review and meta-analysis, we described the prevalence of pre-stroke depression and its association with post-stroke depression. METHODS We searched multiple cross-disciplinary databases from inception to July 2017 and extracted data on the prevalence of pre-stroke depression and its association with post-stroke depression. We assessed the risk of bias (RoB) using validated tools. We described summary estimates of prevalence and summary odds ratio (OR) for association with post-stroke depression, using random-effects models. We performed subgroup analysis describing the effect of depression assessment method. We used a funnel plot to describe potential publication bias. The strength of evidence presented in this review was summarised via 'GRADE'. RESULTS Of 11 884 studies identified, 29 were included (total participants n = 164 993). Pre-stroke depression pooled prevalence was 11.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.2-14.7]; range: 0.4-24% (I2 95.8). Prevalence of pre-stroke depression varied by assessment method (p = 0.02) with clinical interview suggesting greater pre-stroke depression prevalence (~17%) than case-note review (9%) or self-report (11%). Pre-stroke depression was associated with increased odds of post-stroke depression; summary OR 3.0 (95% CI 2.3-4.0). All studies were judged to be at RoB: 59% of included studies had an uncertain RoB in stroke assessment; 83% had high or uncertain RoB for pre-stroke depression assessment. Funnel plot indicated no risk of publication bias. The strength of evidence based on GRADE was 'very low'. CONCLUSIONS One in six stroke patients have had pre-stroke depression. Reported rates may be routinely underestimated due to limitations around assessment.

This study investigated virus entry mechanisms through membrane receptors, their role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and underlying diseases, and treatment methods based on the viral entrance inhibition. According to existing studies, inhibition of ACE2 can increase oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis and ultimately exacerbate underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, diabetes, and hypertension in individuals with COVID-19.

METHOD In a cross-sectional study, 28 patients with refractory major depression, 32 patients with nonrefractory major depression, and 48 healthy comparison subjects underwent scanning using a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence on a 3-T MR system. Thirteen regions of interest that have been identified in the literature as relevant to mood regulation were selected as seed areas. A reference time series was extracted for each seed and used for voxel-wise correlation analysis with the rest of the brain. Voxel-based comparisons of z-value maps among the three groups were performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc t tests with age and duration of illness as covariates of no interest. RESULTS Relative to healthy comparison subjects, both patient groups showed significantly reduced connectivity in prefrontal-limbic-thalamic areas bilaterally. However, the nonrefractory group showed a more distributed decrease in connectivity than the refractory group, especially in the anterior cingulate cortex and in the amygdala, hippocampus, and insula bilaterally; in contrast, the refractory group showed disrupted functional connectivity mainly in prefrontal areas and in thalamus areas bilaterally. CONCLUSIONS Refractory depression is associated with disrupted functional connectivity mainly in thalamo-cortical circuits, while nonrefractory depression is associated with more distributed decreased connectivity in the limbic-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuit. These results suggest that nonrefractory and refractory depression are characterized by distinct functional deficits in distributed brain networks.","Lui, Su; Wu, Qizhu; Qiu, Lihua; Yang, Xun; Kuang, Weihong; Chan, Raymond C K; Huang, Xiaoqi; Kemp, Graham J; Mechelli, Andrea; Gong, Qiyong",The American journal of psychiatry,255,31

Multicellularity was independently established many times among eukaryotes. There are indications that apoptotic programmed cell death is a trait required for the establishment of multicellularity. Regulated cell death is initiated by many different parallel biochemical pathways. It is generally accepted that apoptosis evolved during mitochondrial domestication. However, there are different hypothetical models of the origin of apoptosis. The phylogenetic studies of my group indicate that apoptosis probably evolved during an evolutionary arms race between host ancestral eukaryotic predators and ancestral prey mitochondria (named protomitochondria). Protomitochondrial prey produced many different toxins as a defense against predators. From these toxins evolved extant apoptotic factors. There are indications that aerobic respiration and apoptosis co-evolved and are functionally linked in extant organisms. Perturbations of apoptosis and oxidative respiration are frequently observed during neoplastic transition. Our group showed that perturbations of apoptosis in yeasts also cause perturbations of oxidative respiration.","Kaczanowski, Szymon",Results and problems in cell differentiation,255,1

Flow diverters, such as Pipeline Endovascular Devices (PEDs; Covidien, Medtronic Inc, Dublin, Ireland), have emerged as a potential treatment option. OBJECTIVE To present our experience with patients treated at our institution with PEDs for dissecting distal vertebral artery (V4 segment) aneurysms. METHODS A retrospective search of our prospectively maintained database was performed between January 2014 and December 2016. We queried our database for all patients treated with PED for dissecting aneurysms of the V4 segment. Information was gathered including demographics, the location and morphology of the aneurysm, the clinical presentation, specific form of treatment, complications, antiplatelet medication regimen, and follow-up time. RESULTS There were a total of 9 patients with dissecting V4 aneurysms treated with PED during the study period. All were treated initially with an average of 1.2 PEDs. All patients were followed with at least one repeat diagnostic angiogram and there was no residual aneurysm seen in 8 of 9 cases. In those that presented with neurological deficits, there was an average improvement in modified Rankin Scale of 2.85 points. CONCLUSION PED is a safe and effective tool that can be used to treat ruptured dissecting aneurysms of this specific segment of the posterior circulation, but it does require close management of antiplatelet therapy in the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage and close angiographic follow-up.","Corley, Jacquelyn A; Zomorodi, Ali; Gonzalez, L Fernando",Operative neurosurgery,255,1

Resource reallocation will have consequences on the routine management of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). We consider how to mitigate potential adverse effects. RECENT FINDINGS Combination therapy is well established in hypertension. Many guidelines recommend dual antihypertensive therapy as the initial treatment step as this results in faster blood pressure control, albeit with limited evidence of improved outcomes. Control of CVD risk factors through multiclass combination therapy (the polypill) was proposed many years ago. This approach has not been adopted by Western healthcare systems despite improving surrogate outcomes. Recently, the PolyIran trials have demonstrated improved CVD outcomes without increased adverse events, in both primary and secondary prevention. SUMMARY The COVID-19 pandemic allows models of chronic healthcare to be rethought. Current practices are resource-intensive and there is a need to simplify titration and monitoring protocols in CVD. Moving toward the use of polypill combinations allied with telehealth consultations may be one solution.","Floyd, Christopher N; Wierzbicki, Anthony S",Current opinion in cardiology,255,5

However, since 2013 there has been an Armed Forces team that can also support veterans. This review is an assessment of the work of this group over the last eight years. The health needs of AFVs have been investigated and are not significantly different from those of their demographically matched peers. However, due to their demographics, selection at recruitment and their roles, AFVs compared with the general population are more likely to be male, white and old and have fewer pre-existing or hereditary conditions. However, they do suffer from higher rates of musculoskeletal injury, different patterns of mental health illness and have historically been higher users-and abusers-of alcohol and tobacco. In addition to supporting mainstream services used by AFVs, the NHS in England commissions a bespoke range-specific 'Priority' NHS services such as those for mental health or for rehabilitation of veterans using prostheses.

IFITM3 localizes to endolysosomes where it prevents virus fusion, although mechanisms controlling its trafficking to this cellular compartment are not fully understood. We determined that both mouse and human IFITM3 are phosphorylated by the protein-tyrosine kinase FYN on tyrosine 20 (Tyr(20)) and that mouse IFITM3 is also phosphorylated on the non-conserved Tyr(27). Phosphorylation led to a cellular redistribution of IFITM3, including plasma membrane accumulation. Mutation of Tyr(20) caused a similar redistribution of IFITM3 and resulted in decreased antiviral activity against influenza virus, whereas Tyr(27) mutation of mouse IFITM3 showed minimal effects on localization or activity. Using FYN knockout cells, we also found that IFITM3 phosphorylation is not a requirement for its antiviral activity. Together, these results indicate that Tyr(20) is part of an endocytosis signal that can be blocked by phosphorylation or by mutation of this residue. Further mutagenesis narrowed this endocytosis-controlling region to four residues conforming to a YXXΦ (where X is any amino acid and Φ is Val, Leu, or Ile) endocytic motif that, when transferred to CD4, resulted in its internalization from the cell surface. Additionally, we found that phosphorylation of IFITM3 by FYN and mutagenesis of Tyr(20) both resulted in decreased IFITM3 ubiquitination. Overall, these results suggest that modification of Tyr(20) may serve in a cellular checkpoint controlling IFITM3 trafficking and degradation and demonstrate the complexity of posttranslational regulation of IFITM3.","Chesarino, Nicholas M; McMichael, Temet M; Hach, Jocelyn C; Yount, Jacob S",The Journal of biological chemistry,255,1

Randomized clinical trials are considered as the gold standard in evidence-based medicine. Registration of clinical trials enables disseminating evidence among clinicians, researchers, and patients. It promotes transparency and avoids duplication. The registration process is mandatory for AYUSH clinical trials also. OBJECTIVES This analysis is aimed to determine the different characteristics of registered AYUSH clinical trials in CTRI from 2009 to 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional retrospective analysis was conducted. The information on registered clinical trials about AYUSH was obtained from the website www.ctri.nic.in from 2009 to 2020 (n = 3632; last accessed on July 30 2020). Data analysis considered the following factors for analysis using descriptive statistics. The number of clinical trials registered in AYUSH stream were classified according to registration type (retrospective/prospective), postgraduate dissertations (yes/no), primary sponsor, type of trial (interventional/observational), study design, health condition and State-wise distribution of sites of studies. RESULTS The number of clinical trial registrations among AYUSH streams (3632) descends from Ayurveda (2054), followed by Siddha (635), Yoga (408), Unani (366) and Homoeopathy (169). Interventional studies dominate observational studies among all AYUSH registered trials. AYUSH streams took four years to register in CTRI due to an increase in reporting trials from 2013. Significant number of trials were registered retrospectively. The order of closure of retrospective registration has influenced an increase in prospective enrolment between 2017-2019. CONCLUSION Registration of clinical trials in the CTRI should be encouraged. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) occupy a rear seat which exposes an opportunity for trials and alarms about weak trials. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are registered more comparatively, which reflects the strength of AYUSH in NCDs. Most of the trials fall under phase 2, which seems to have an increasing opportunity for more trials. Certain visible flaws like registering Phase 2 trials as Phase 3 or 4 and domestic trials as international trials reflect human resources crunch in ICMR-CTRI in Issuing Certificates. These errors should be rectified by training the stakeholders effectively.","Shree Devi, M S; Sathiyarajeswaran, P; Kanakavalli, K; Vinod, N P; Baskar, V",Journal of Ayurveda and integrative medicine,255,11

Here, we combined cell fractionation, ribosome profiling, and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the subcellular organization of viral genome translation and replication as well as host cell translation and its response to DENV infection. We report that throughout the viral life cycle, DENV plus- and minus-strand RNAs were highly partitioned to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), identifying the ER as the primary site of DENV translation. DENV infection was accompanied by an ER compartment-specific remodeling of translation, where ER translation capacity was subverted from host transcripts to DENV plus-strand RNA, particularly at late stages of infection. Remarkably, translation levels and patterns in the cytosol compartment were only modestly affected throughout the experimental time course of infection. Comparisons of ribosome footprinting densities of the DENV plus-strand RNA and host mRNAs indicated that DENV plus-strand RNA was only sparsely loaded with ribosomes. Combined, these observations suggest a mechanism where ER-localized translation and translational control mechanisms, likely cis encoded, are used to repurpose the ER for DENV virion production. Consistent with this view, we found ER-linked cellular stress response pathways commonly associated with viral infection, namely, the interferon response and unfolded protein response, to be only modestly activated during DENV infection. These data support a model where DENV reprograms the ER protein synthesis and processing environment to promote viral survival and replication while minimizing the activation of antiviral and proteostatic stress response pathways.IMPORTANCE DENV, a prominent human health threat with no broadly effective or specific treatment, depends on host cell translation machinery for viral replication, immune evasion, and virion biogenesis. The molecular mechanism by which DENV commandeers the host cell protein synthesis machinery and the subcellular organization of DENV replication and viral protein synthesis is poorly understood. Here, we report that DENV has an almost exclusively ER-localized life cycle, with viral replication and translation largely restricted to the ER. Surprisingly, DENV infection largely affects only ER-associated translation, with relatively modest effects on host cell translation in the cytosol. DENV RNA translation is very inefficient, likely representing a strategy to minimize disruption of ER proteostasis. Overall these findings demonstrate that DENV has evolved an ER-compartmentalized life cycle; thus, targeting the molecular signatures and regulation of the DENV-ER interaction landscape may reveal strategies for therapeutic intervention.","Reid, David W; Campos, Rafael K; Child, Jessica R; Zheng, Tianli; Chan, Kitti Wing Ki; Bradrick, Shelton S; Vasudevan, Subhash G; Garcia-Blanco, Mariano A; Nicchitta, Christopher V",Journal of virology,255,16

It seems that the appropriate identification of all people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the best strategy to limit COVID-19 transmission. However, in a significant proportion of patients, there are no clinical manifestations of the disease, symptoms may be very mild or atypical. There is a growing body of evidence that digestive manifestations of COVID-19 are frequently reported and may precede typical respiratory symptoms. Moreover, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 particles was shown in the gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and viral RNA was detected in the feces of COVID-19 patients. These data suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 are not an accidental finding, but they may result from direct digestive involvement. Patients with new-onset diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting without any other evident etiological factors should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We orthotopically implanted PyMT breast tumor cells into the mammary fat pads of syngeneic LysMcre, HIF-1α fl/fl /LysMcre, or HIF-2α fl/fl /LysMcre mice and evaluated the tumor TEM population. There was no difference in the percentage of tumor macrophages among the mouse groups.

Proangiogenic TEMs in macrophage HIF-2α-deficient tumors presented significantly more CD31+ microvessel density but exacerbated hypoxia and tissue necrosis. Reduced numbers of proangiogenic TEMs in macrophage HIF-1α-deficient tumors presented significantly less microvessel density but tumor vessels that were more functional as lectin injection revealed more perfusion, and functional electron paramagnetic resonance analysis revealed more oxygen in those tumors. Macrophage HIF-1α-deficient tumors also responded significantly to chemotherapy. These data introduce a previously undescribed and counterintuitive prohypoxia role for proangiogenic TEMs in breast cancer which is, in part, suppressed by HIF-2α.","Steinberger, Kayla J; Forget, Mary A; Bobko, Andrey A; Mihalik, Nicole E; Gencheva, Marieta; Roda, Julie M; Cole, Sara L; Mo, Xiaokui; Hoblitzell, E Hannah; Evans, Randall; Gross, Amy C; Moldovan, Leni; Marsh, Clay B; Khramstov, Valery V; Eubank, Timothy D",Journal of immunology,255,31

One of the major complications of CF-LVAD is cerebrovascular events(CVE). Limited information is available on this complication in pediatric patients. We hereby present our experience on CVE in children under CF-LVAD support in our institution. METHODS A retrospective, single center review of 21 patients younger than 19 years of age who underwent CF-LVAD implantation between June 2014 and September 2018 was performed. Patients on biventricular support and extracorporeal device were excluded. Cerebrovascular accidents-ischemic or hemorrhagic-were investigated. CVE was confirmed by brain computed tomographic scan. RESULTS Of twenty-one pediatric patients, 11 was male. Mean BSA was 1.05±0.41 m2 and mean age was 11.05±4.07 years. Dilated cardiomyopathy was the leading cause of heart failure. The patients were implanted HeartWare hVAD (n=19), Heartmate II (n=1) and Heartmate III (n=1). Mean support time was 421±448(18-1460) days. Target international normalized ratio was between 2.5-3.0. Nine(43%) patients underwent transplantation, 1 patient recovered with subsequent device explantation. Four(17%) patients were still on support. One patient(5%) died in early postoperative period and 6(28%) patients died on VAD support after mean duration of 194 days. There were overall 5 cerebral hemorrhagic strokes in 4 patients(0.2 events per patient-year). CVA occurred between 250 and 1320 days(mean 600 days). No ischemic stroke was documented. Only one(20%) patient died after hemorrhagic stroke; other 3 patients recovered and were discharged from the hospital with minor sequelaes. CONCLUSION Incidence of CVE in children on CF-LVAD is relatively low compared with adults on VAD and severity of stroke is milder than adult population.","Sert, Dogan Emre; Kocabeyoglu, Sinan Sabit; Kervan, Umit; Karahan, Mehmet; Beyazal, Osman Fehmi; Akdi, Mustafa; Yilmaz, Abdulkadir; Catav, Zeki",Artificial organs,255,17

After encouraging successes with the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic, the intent of the legally binding Treaty to improve the capacity of all countries to detect, assess, notify, and respond to public health threats has shamefully lapsed. Despite the granting of 2-year extensions in 2012 to countries to meet core surveillance and response requirements, less than 20% of countries have complied. Today it is not realistic to expect that these gaps will be solved or narrowed in the foreseeable future by the IHR or the WHO alone under current provisions. The unfortunate failures that culminated in an inadequate response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa are multifactorial, including funding, staffing, and poor leadership decisions, but all are reversible. A rush by the Global Health Security Agenda partners to fill critical gaps in administrative and operational areas has been crucial in the short term, but questions remain as to the real priorities of the G20 as time elapses and critical gaps in public health protections and infrastructure take precedence over the economic and security needs of the developed world. The response from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and foreign medical teams to Ebola proved indispensable to global health security, but both deserve stronger strategic capacity support and institutional status under the WHO leadership granted by the IHR Treaty. Treaties are the most successful means the world has in preventing, preparing for, and controlling epidemics in an increasingly globalized world. Other options are not sustainable. Given the gravity of ongoing failed treaty management, the slow and incomplete process of reform, the magnitude and complexity of infectious disease outbreaks, and the rising severity of public health emergencies, a recommitment must be made to complete and restore the original mandates as a collaborative and coordinated global network responsibility, not one left to the actions of individual countries. The bottom line is that the global community can no longer tolerate an ineffectual and passive international response system. As such, this Treaty has the potential to become one of the most effective treaties for crisis response and risk reduction worldwide. Practitioners and health decision-makers worldwide must break their silence and advocate for a stronger Treaty and a return of WHO authority.","Burkle, Frederick M",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,255,1

The current study investigated a new CFD-based method of evaluating pressure-flow curves across a stenosis to further enhance the diagnostic value of cCTA imaging. METHODS Fifty-eight patients who underwent both cCTA imaging and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with fractional flow reserve (FFR) within 2 weeks were enrolled. The pressure-flow curve-derived parameters, viscous friction (VF) and expansion loss (EL), were compared with conventional cCTA parameters including percent area stenosis (AS) and minimum lumen area (MLA) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. FFR ≤ 0.80 was used to indicate ischemia-causing stenosis. Correlations between FFR and other measurements were calculated by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rho). RESULTS Sixty-eight stenoses from 58 patients were analyzed. VF, EL, and AS were significantly larger in the group of FFR ≤ 0.8 while smaller MLA values were observed. The ROC-AUC of VF (0.91, 95% CI 0.81-0.96) was better than that of AS (change in AUC (ΔAUC) 0.27, p < 0.05) and MLA (ΔAUC 0.17, p < 0.05), and ROC-AUC of EL (0.90, 95%CI 0.80-0.96) was also better than that of AS (ΔAUC 0.26, p < 0.05) and MLA (ΔAUC 0.16, p < 0.05). FFR values correlated well with VF (rho = - 0.74 (95% CI - 0.83 to - 0.61, p < 0.0001) and EL (rho = - 0.74 (95% CI - 0.83 to - 0.61, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION Pressure-flow curve-derived parameters enhance the diagnostic value of cCTA examination. KEY POINTS • Pressure-flow curve derived from cCTA can assess coronary lesion severity. • VF and EL are superior to cCTA alone for indicating ischemic lesions. • Pressure-flow curve derived from cCTA may assist in clinical decision-making.","Xie, Xinzhou; Wen, Didi; Zhang, Ruichen; Tao, Qian; Wang, Ce; Xie, Songyun; Liu, Hui; Zheng, Minwen",European radiology,255,1

MATERIALS 2,883 well-preserved skeletal elements and 9 relatively complete skulls representing an MNI of 32 non-adults (<18 years old). METHODS All skeletal elements were observed macroscopically and pathophysiological processes underlying any lesions or other anomalies were assessed, followed by a comparative approach to rule out potential diagnoses. RESULTS The skeletal lesions observed were caused by inflammation due to chronic hemorrhaging, marrow hyperplasia due to an increase in hemopoiesis, rapid bone growth, and the impact of biomechanical strain on poorly mineralized elements. Rickets, scurvy, and acquired anemias best fit this pattern of lesions, although inflammation from other sources such as trauma or infection could not be definitively ruled out. CONCLUSIONS The in utero and postnatal environments at Hisban were conducive to the development of vitamin C and D deficiencies from birth until 2 years of age.

These studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals have a consistent chemokine signature comprising cytokines and monocyte-associated chemokines (CCL2 and CCL8).

We present a PED-related complication and describe a salvage strategy. CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 64-year-old woman underwent PED-assisted parent vessel reconstruction for her giant cavernous internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm. During placement of the first PED, the proximal part of the PED foreshortened and was displaced into the aneurysm sac. Multiple subsequent attempts to recatheterize the PED failed, and, ultimately, distal access through and beyond the PED was lost. Therefore, completion of the Pipeline construct by stacking PEDs for definitive treatment was prevented. Retrograde access of the PED was gained from the distal ICA through a microwire that was advanced from the basilar artery through the posterior communicating artery. The microwire from the distal ICA was grasped with a snare from the proximal ICA and pulled down to the cervical ICA. The opened snare around the microwire was used as a lasso to advance a microcatheter from the cervical ICA through the PED to regain distal access. Five more PEDs were used to achieve complete parent vessel reconstruction and aneurysm obliteration. CONCLUSION Maintaining distal access is critical until the entire parent vessel is reconstructed, especially when multiple PEDs are required. The salvage technique described may help regain distal access if it is lost during the procedure.","Hauck, Erik F; Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Langer, David J; Hopkins, L Nelson; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I",Neurosurgery,255,1

In the context of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), MDSCs (in the donor graft and in the recipient, after allo-HSCT) might mediate immune suppression through multiple mechanisms. However, it remains unclear how MDSCs can be distinguished from their normal myeloid counterparts in the hematopoietic stem cell donor graft and during immune reconstitution after allo-HSCT in the recipient. Our ability to understand their exact role in allo-HSCT is limited by the absence of a specific gene signature or surface markers for identifying MDSCs among myeloid cells and by their plasticity in different microenvironments. According to various studies, MDSCs might induce transplant tolerance and control graft vs. host disease (GVHD), but their impact on the graft vs. tumor effect (GVT) is not fully understood. In fact, we know that MDSCs commonly expand in patients with cancer, and they are thought to promote hematological malignancy progression. However, little is known about whether depleting them might be an effective strategy for enhancing GVT effects. Here, we review data published over the past 40 years on allo-HSCT to delineate the different MDSC subsets, and their abilities to induce transplant tolerance and preserve the GVT effect. This review will provide a basis for determining whether one MDSC subset might be proposed as the most appropriate candidate for cellular therapies, due to its ability to modulate GVHD.","D'Aveni, Maud; Notarantonio, Anne B; Bertrand, Allan; Boulangé, Laura; Pochon, Cécile; Rubio, Marie T",Frontiers in immunology,255,1

We aimed at investigating whether and how the COVID-19 outbreak limited access to ED and affected urgent surgical activities during and immediately after the 2-month pandemic-related national lockdown. METHODS Data regarding patients who accessed to the surgical ED were retrospectively collected. Analysed time-periods included: 'Pre-COVID-19 Era', 'COVID-19 Era' considered as the period of full national lockdown and 'Post-COVID-19 Era' after easing of lockdown measures. Consecutive emergency surgical procedures and ED admissions before, during and after COVID-19-lockdown were retrieved and analysed. RESULTS There was a significant decrease in overall ED admissions and in all-specialty surgical consultations (P<0.01) throughout the outbreak. Once national lockdown was eased, we recorded a subsequent rebound 5-fold rise of emergency surgical procedures compared to COVID-19 group (P=0.011). Time-to-surgery was significantly greater in 'COVID-19 era' and 'post-COVID-19 era' compared to 'pre-COVID-19' group (22.56±4.78, 75.99±15.89 and 16.73 ±1.76 hours, respectively) (P<0.01). A raised incidence of postoperative complications emerged in the 'COVID-19 era' group (37.5%) compared to pre and post-COVID groups (9.1% and 12.5%, respectively; P<0.001). Mortality rate in the 'COVID-19 era' was 31.3% and 7.5% in 'post-COVID-19' group (<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the major reduction of emergency surgical procedures and overall ED admissions caused by COVID-19 pandemic. The raised rate of postoperative complications and mortality might be likely due to the superior severity of surgical conditions observed in the 'COVID-19 era' subjects together with a probable deferred pursuit of medical attention.","Casella, Giovanni; Castagneto-Gissey, Lidia; Lattina, Ilario; Ferrari, Paolo; Iodice, Alessandra; Tesori, Chiara; Catani, Marco; Assenza, Marco; Mingoli, Andrea; LA Torre, Filippo",Minerva surgery,255,1

Unfortunately, public health approaches and solutions applied in developed countries are often assumed to be inappropriate or unattainable in developing countries. This has sometimes forestalled effective interventions in parts of the world where they are most needed, despite conditions that now facilitate lasting solutions to both long-standing and emerging global public health problems. Core public health functions are similar regardless of a country's income level. Although some resource-intensive approaches from industrialised nations are inappropriate in less developed countries, many basic public health measures achieved decades ago in developed countries are urgently needed, highly appropriate, extremely cost-effective and eminently attainable in developing countries today. About half of the disease burden in low and middle-income countries is now from non-communicable diseases, but non-communicable disease epidemics that will otherwise increase rapidly in the developing world can be avoided or reversed. Progress of public health in developing countries is possible, but will require sufficient funding and human resources; improved physical plant and information systems; effective programme implementation and regulatory capacity; and, most importantly, political will at the highest levels of government.","Frieden, T R; Henning, K J",Global public health,255,17
119210,119210,119210,Hands free adjustment of the Microscope in Microneurosurgery.,15.880959,6.894753,2020-12-29,"BACKGROUND Reprocessed devices must be thoroughly cleaned prior to sterilization to ensure efficacy of sterilization agents. Many single-use devices are not designed to be thoroughly cleaned. Interlocking design features inherent to LigaSure™ vessel sealing devices may prevent thorough cleaning and promote accumulation of human tissue that cannot be removed. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare industry reprocessed and new LigaSure™ vessel sealing devices for organic material. METHODS A total of 168, 84 new and 84 reprocessed, vessel sealing devices were disassembled and inspected for the presence of residual organic matter using visual, microscopic, and chemical analysis. Devices were randomized and test conductors blinded to group membership. Devices were aseptically disassembled and sent through visual inspection. Next, devices were either examined using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or exposed to a solution that luminesces in the presence of hemoglobin. Additionally, 165 reprocessed devices were sent to a 3rd party lab for sterility testing via direct immersion culture for 14 days. RESULTS Significant amounts of remnant organic material (C, N, O, S, Na, P) were observed with 81/84 reprocessed and 0/84 new devices failing inspection protocols. When tested for the presence of hemoglobin, only 1/12 reprocessed devices passed inspection. SEM of reprocessed devices revealed residues with liquid patterns and diffuse soiling with foreign material. Sterility testing of reprocessed devices revealed a sterility level < 6-3. CONCLUSIONS The abundance of material resembling human tissue observed on reprocessed VSDs suggests inadequate cleaning prior to sterilization. Atomic and morphological analyses of the remnant materials suggest that bacterial biofilms could also be present. Additionally, surface degradation and release of reinforcing glass fibers from the device were observed. Devices designed for single use can harbor significant amounts of remnant material that likely interfere with the sterilization process.","Chivukula, Swathi Ramesh; Lammers, Steven; Wagner, Jennifer",Surgical endoscopy,255,19

However, noninvasive approaches to measuring stiffness are limited. Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) of the brain is a relatively new noninvasive imaging method that provides quantitative measures of brain tissue stiffness. Herein, we aimed to use MRE to assess brain stiffness in hydrocephalus patients compared to healthy controls, and to assess its associations with ventricular size, as well as demographic, shunt-related and clinical outcome measures. METHODS MRE was collected at two imaging sites in 39 hydrocephalus patients and 33 healthy controls, along with demographic, shunt-related, and clinical outcome measures including headache and quality of life indices. Brain stiffness was quantified for whole brain, global white matter (WM), and lobar WM stiffness. Group differences in brain stiffness between patients and controls were compared using two-sample t-tests and multivariable linear regression to adjust for age, sex, and ventricular volume. Among patients, multivariable linear or logistic regression was used to assess which factors (age, sex, ventricular volume, age at first shunt, number of shunt revisions) were associated with brain stiffness and whether brain stiffness predicts clinical outcomes (quality of life, headache and depression). RESULTS Brain stiffness was significantly reduced in patients compared to controls, both unadjusted (p ≤ 0.002) and adjusted (p ≤ 0.03) for covariates. Among hydrocephalic patients, lower stiffness was associated with older age in temporal and parietal WM and whole brain (WB) (beta (SE): -7.6 (2.5), p = 0.004; -9.5 (2.2), p = 0.0002; -3.7 (1.8), p = 0.046), being female in global and frontal WM and WB (beta (SE): -75.6 (25.5), p = 0.01; -66.0 (32.4), p = 0.05; -73.2 (25.3), p = 0.01), larger ventricular volume in global, and occipital WM (beta (SE): -11.5 (3.4), p = 0.002; -18.9 (5.4), p = 0.0014). Lower brain stiffness also predicted worse quality of life and a higher likelihood of depression, controlling for all other factors. CONCLUSIONS Brain stiffness is reduced in hydrocephalus patients compared to healthy controls, and is associated with clinically-relevant functional outcome measures. MRE may emerge as a clinically-relevant biomarker to assess the neuropathological effects of hydrocephalus and shunting, and may be useful in evaluating the effects of therapeutic alternatives, or as a supplement, of shunting.","Wagshul, M E; McAllister, J P; Limbrick, D D; Yang, S; Mowrey, W; Goodrich, J T; Meiri, A; Morales, D M; Kobets, A; Abbott, R",NeuroImage.

We describe a unique case with cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic and cutaneous involvement at time of presentation. This case accentuates the importance of an extensive multidisciplinary diagnostic work-up, since iHES is a condition with potential rapid progressive multiorgan failure which requires prompt analysis and treatment. In addition, this case emphasises the importance of being aware of tunnel vision, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, which might give rise to an increased risk of missing rare diagnoses.

MATERIAL AND METHODS There were 14 patients with pneumomediastinum and COVID-19 infection without mechanical ventilation. We discussed the world data on pneumomediastinum in patients with coronavirus infection. RESULTS Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the annual number of own observations of spontaneous pneumomediastinum did not exceed 1-2 patients. The mechanism of pneumomediastinum is explained by the Macklin effect. COVID-19 pandemic in the Russian Federation was followed by increase of the number of patients with pneumomediastinum up to 2.4% of the total number of patients in the thoracic department. In this sample, pneumomediastinum occurred at all variants of the course of coronavirus infection. The timing of pneumomediastinum ranged from 2 to 18 (median 14) days after clinical manifestation of COVID-19. In 2 out of 14 cases, pneumomediastinum was the main symptom of coronavirus infection at admission. One patient had a combination of pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax. In 6 cases, pneumomediastinum was stable and regressed under conservative therapy. Eight patients underwent Razumovsky suprajugular mediastinotomy. There were no postoperative deaths. Recurrent pneumomediastinum was noted in one patient. CONCLUSION The causes of pneumomediastinum in some patients with coronavirus infection, peculiarities of diagnosis and treatment and clarification of indications for invasive interventions require further study.","Polyantsev, A A; Panin, S I; Kotrunov, V V",Khirurgiia,255,1

For drug testing and disease researches, both animal models and preclinical trials with cell cultures are extremely important, but present some limitations, such as ethical concern and inability of representing complex tissues and organs. 3D cell cultures arise providing a more realistic in vitro representation of tissues and organs. Environment and cell type in 3D cultures can represent in vivo conditions and thus provide accurate data on cell-to-cell interactions, and cultivation techniques are based on a scaffold, usually hydrogel or another polymeric material, or without scaffold, such as suspended microplates, magnetic levitation, and microplates for spheroids with ultra-low fixation coating. PURPOSE AND SCOPE This review aims at presenting an updated summary of the most common 3D cell culture models available, as well as a historical background of their establishment and possible applications. SUMMARY Even though 3D culturing is incapable of replacing other current research types, they will continue to substitute some unnecessary animal experimentation, as well as complement monolayer cultures. CONCLUSION In this aspect, 3D culture emerges as a valuable alternative to the investigation of functional, biochemical, and molecular aspects of human pathologies.","Sakalem, Marna Eliana; De Sibio, Maria Teresa; da Costa, Felipe Allan da Silva; de Oliveira, Miriane",Biotechnology journal,255,1

METHODS A systematic search was conducted of PubMed, Embase, SCIELO, and CINAHL databases for studies evaluating measurement properties of QoL instruments in women with UI. The methodological quality of studies and the quality of measurement properties were evaluated using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INtruments (COSMIN) checklist and quality criteria. Overall, evidence for measurement properties was graded using the modified grading of recommendations, assessment, development & evaluation approach. RESULTS A total of 73 studies were included, and 27 specific and 6 generic instruments were identified. The Incontinence QoL questionnaire (IQoL) had the highest overall psychometric quality for English-speaking populations and was the most widely translated tool. Evidence for generic QoL tools in this population is limited. Few studies evaluated measurement error or cross-cultural validity. CONCLUSION The IQoL is the most psychometrically robust disease-specific tool for use in this population. More research is needed to determine the most psychometrically robust generic tool. Future studies should also evaluate measurement error and cross-cultural validity as evidence for these properties is particularly lacking.","Wuytack, Francesca; Moran, Patrick; Daly, Deirdre; Panda, Sunita; Hannon, Kathleen; Cusack, Cinny; O'Donovan, Maggie",Neurourology and urodynamics,255,12

While these measures were crucial to stop the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2, numerous voices highlighted their disorderly psychological, social, and economic impacts on food consumption behavior and lifestyle. Therefore, this paper aims to understand how consumers' food-related habits in Russia have shifted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and potential problems and opportunities this might bring for the Russian food system. The study is based on an online cross-sectional survey using a structured questionnaire administered in Russian through the Survey Monkey platform. A total of 1297 valid answers was collected. The results reveal that diet and food shopping, preparation, and use have been widely affected. Indeed, the survey results suggested (i) a change in the modality of acquiring food, consumers reduced the number of shopping trips and buying more on each trip to minimize store visits; (ii) a surge of stockpiling of non-perishable food items; (iii) a shift toward healthier diets; (iv) an increase in culinary capabilities; (v) a decrease of food waste. The results are expected to inform current emergency plans as well as long-term food-related strategies in Russia.","Ben Hassen, Tarek; El Bilali, Hamid; Allahyari, Mohammad S; Berjan, Sinisa; Fotina, Oksana",Appetite,255,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS 26 patients undergoing lobar treatment with (90)Y microspheres underwent PET/MRI within 66 h of treatment and had follow-up imaging available. Adequate visualization of tumor was available in 24 patients, and contours were drawn on simultaneously acquired PET/MRI data. Dose volume histograms (DVHs) were extracted from dose maps, which were generated using a voxelized dose kernel. Similar contours to capture dimensional and volumetric change of tumors were drawn on follow-up imaging. Response was analyzed using both RECIST and volumetric RECIST (vRECIST) criteria. RESULTS A total of 8 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 4 neuroendocrine tumor (NET), 9 colorectal metastases (CRC) patients, and 3 patients with other metastatic disease met inclusion criteria. Average dose was useful in predicting response between responders and non-responders for all lesion types and for CRC lesions alone using both response criteria (p < 0.05). D70 (minimum dose to 70 % of volume) was also useful in predicting response when using vRECIST. No significant trend was seen in the other tumor types. For CRC lesions, an average dose of 29.8 Gy offered 76.9 % sensitivity and 75.9 % specificity for response. CONCLUSIONS PET/MRI of (90)Y microsphere distribution showed significantly higher DVH values for responders than non-responders in patients with CRC. DVH analysis of (90)Y microsphere distribution following treatment may be an important predictor of response and could be used to guide future adaptive therapy trials.","Fowler, Kathryn J; Maughan, Nichole M; Laforest, Richard; Saad, Nael E; Sharma, Akash; Olsen, Jeffrey; Speirs, Christina K; Parikh, Parag J",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,255,26

We aimed to assess the number, characteristics and in-hospital course of patients admitted for acute cardiovascular diseases during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS We enrolled all consecutive patients admitted urgently for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure or arrhythmias from 1 March to 31 May 2020 (outbreak period) and 2019 (control period). We evaluated the time from symptoms onset to presentation, clinical conditions at admission, length of hospitalization, in-hospital medical procedures and outcome. The combined primary end point included in-hospital death for cardiovascular causes, urgent heart transplant or discharge with a ventricular assist device. RESULTS A similar number of admissions were observed in 2020 (N = 210) compared with 2019 (N = 207). Baseline characteristics of patients were also similar. In 2020, a significantly higher number of patients presented more than 6 h after symptoms onset (57 versus 38%, P < 0.001) and with signs of heart failure (33 versus 20%, P = 0.018), required urgent surgery (13 versus 5%, P = 0.004) and ventilatory support (26 versus 13%, P < 0.001). Hospitalization duration was longer in 2020 (median 10 versus 8 days, P = 0.03). The primary end point was met by 19 (9.0%) patients in 2020 versus 10 (4.8%) in 2019 (P = 0.09). CONCLUSION Despite the similar number and types of unplanned admissions for acute cardiac conditions during the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak compared with the same period in 2019, we observed a higher number of patients presenting late after symptoms onset as well as longer and more complicated clinical courses.","Zorzi, Alessandro; Vio, Riccardo; Rivezzi, Francesco; Falzone, Pasquale V; Giordani, Andrea S; Condello, Chiara; Dellino, Carlo M; Deola, Petra; Gallucci, Marco; Giannattasio, Alessia; Licchelli, Luca; Lupasco, Diana; Montonati, Carolina; Ravagnin, Alberto; Sinigiani, Giulio; Torreggiani, Gianpaolo; Vianello, Riccardo; Migliore, Federico; Famoso, Giulia; Babuin, Luciano; Cacciavillani, Luisa; Iliceto, Sabino",Journal of cardiovascular medicine,255,17

MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective cohort study included infants who received liver MRI examinations to evaluate cholestasis from July 2009 to October 2017. Liver ADC, ADC ratio of liver/spleen, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), and spleen size were compared between the BA and non-BA groups. The diagnostic performances of all parameters for significant fibrosis (F3-4) were obtained by receiver-operating characteristics (ROCs) curve analysis. RESULTS Altogether, 227 infants (98 males and 129 females, mean age = 57.2 ± 36.3 days) including 125 BA patients were analyzed. The absolute ADC difference between two reviewers was 0.10 mm²/s for both liver and spleen. Liver ADC value was specific (80.4%) and ADC ratio was sensitive (88.0%) for the diagnosis of BA with comparable performance. There were 33 patients with F0, 15 with F1, 71 with F2, 35 with F3, and 11 with F4. All four parameters of APRI (τ = 0.296), spleen size (τ = 0.312), liver ADC (τ = -0.206), and ADC ratio (τ = -0.288) showed significant correlation with fibrosis grade (all, p < 0.001). The cutoff values for significant fibrosis (F3-4) were 0.783 for APRI (area under the ROC curve [AUC], 0.721), 5.9 cm for spleen size (AUC, 0.719), 1.044 × 10-3 mm²/s for liver ADC (AUC, 0.673), and 1.22 for ADC ratio (AUC, 0.651).

Out of 842,197 tests, 11.7% were positive and 88.3% negative. The prevalence of HIV was 6.25 and 6.31% in the SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative cohort, respectively (p = 0.444). However, the prevalence of HIV-positive individuals in the critical cohort (9.15%) was higher than in the noncritical group (6.24%) (p = 0.011). Active tuberculosis infection was approximately 50% less in SARS-CoV-2-positive than in SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals. The prevalence of uncontrolled diabetes was 3.4 times higher in SARS-CoV-2-positive cases but was not higher in the critical vs. noncritical cases (p = 0.612). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, coagulation markers, urea, and cardiac- and liver-related analytes were significantly elevated in the critical compared to noncritical cases. Platelet count and creatinine concentration did not differ significantly between the two groups. These findings do not support increased prevalence of HIV or tuberculosis in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection but do suggest an association of increased disease severity with HIV-positive status. Uncontrolled diabetes was positively associated with a significantly higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, and our investigation into analyte changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 disease severity supported previous findings of raised inflammatory markers, coagulation markers, liver- and cardiac-related analytes, and urea but not for creatinine and platelet count.","Hesse, R; van der Westhuizen, D J; George, J A",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,255,17

Thrombin is generated from activation of prothrombin by the prothrombinase (IIase) complex comprising factor Xa, factor Va, and Ca++ ions located on surfaces where these factors are assembled. We discovered that SkM and CM, which are abundant motor proteins in skeletal and cardiac muscles, can provide a surface for thrombin generation by the prothrombinase complex without any apparent requirement for phosphatidylserine or lipids. These myosins can also provide a surface that supports the inactivation of factor Va by activated protein C/protein S, resulting in negative feedback downregulation of thrombin generation. While the physiologic significance of these reactions remains to be established for humans, substantive insights may be gleaned from murine studies. In mice, exogenously infused SkM and CM can promote hemostasis as they are capable of reducing tail cut bleeding. In a murine myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury model, exogenously infused CM exacerbates myocardial infarction damage. Studies of human plasmas show that SkM antigen isoforms of different MWs circulate in human plasma, and they can be used to identify 3 plasma SkM phenotypes. A pilot clinical study showed that one SkM isoform pattern appeared to be linked to isolated pulmonary embolism. These discoveries enable multiple preclinical and clinical studies of SkM and CM which should provide novel mechanistic insights with potential translational relevance for the roles of CM and SkM in the pathobiology of hemostasis and thrombosis.","Deguchi, Hiroshi; Morla, Shravan; Griffin, John H",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,255,13

METHODS We used optoelectronic plethysmography to assess the effect of surgical and bronchoscopic LVR on chest wall asynchrony. Twenty-six patients were assessed before and 3 months after LVR (surgical [n = 9] or bronchoscopic [n = 7]) or a sham/unsuccessful bronchoscopic treatment (control subjects, n = 10). Chest wall volumes were divided into six compartments (left and right of each of pulmonary ribcage [Vrc,p], abdominal ribcage [Vrc,a], and abdomen [Vab]) and phase shift angles (θ) calculated for the asynchrony between Vrc,p and Vrc,a (θRC), and between Vrc,a and Vab (θDIA). RESULTS Participants had an FEV₁ of 34.6 ± 18% predicted and a residual volume of 217.8 ± 46.0% predicted with significant chest wall asynchrony during quiet breathing at baseline (θRC, 31.3° ± 38.4°; and θDIA, -38.7° ± 36.3°). Between-group difference in the change in θRC and θDIA during quiet breathing following treatment was 44.3° (95% CI, -78 to -10.6; P = .003) and 34.5° (95% CI, 1.4 to 67.5; P = .007) toward 0° (representing perfect synchrony), respectively, favoring the LVR group.

Patients with breast cancer lesions that express IGF-1R may benefit from treatment with anti-IGF-1R antibodies. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to develop a noninvasive, in vivo imaging method, using radiolabeled antibodies, to visualize IGF-1R expression. METHODS R1507 is a monoclonal antibody directed against the IGF-1R. In vitro, the affinity and internalization kinetics of (111)In-R1507 were determined using the IGF-1R-expressing triple-negative breast cancer cell line SUM149. In vivo, the pharmacodynamics of (111)In-R1507 and (125)I-R1507 were determined in mice with subcutaneous SUM149 tumors. (111)In-R1507 SPECT and (89)Zr-R1507 PET images of mice with subcutaneous SUM149 tumors were acquired at 1, 3, and 7 d after injection. RESULTS (111)In-R1507 (concentration required to inhibit binding by 50%, 0.1 nM) was slowly internalized by SUM149 cells. (111)In-R1507 specifically and efficiently accumulated in the SUM149 xenografts: the tumor uptake was 20 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g), 33 %ID/g, and 31 %ID/g at 1, 3, and 7 d after injection, respectively. (125)I-R1507 accumulated in the tumor less efficiently. Small-animal SPECT and small-animal PET of mice clearly visualized the subcutaneous SUM149 xenograft, with increasing contrast at later time points. CONCLUSION (111)In-R1507 and (89)Zr-R1507 are new tracers to noninvasively determine IGF-1R expression in vivo in breast cancer xenografts using SPECT and PET. In the future, these techniques may enable patient selection for IGF-1R-targeted therapy.","Heskamp, Sandra; van Laarhoven, Hanneke W M; Molkenboer-Kuenen, Janneke D M; Franssen, Gerben M; Versleijen-Jonkers, Yvonne M H; Oyen, Wim J G; van der Graaf, Winette T A; Boerman, Otto C","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",255,1

Our primary aim was to describe differences in clinical and epidemiological variables, in-hospital management, and outcomes between LTCF residents and community-dwelling older adults hospitalized with COVID-19. The secondary aim was to identify risk factors for mortality due to COVID-19 in hospitalized LTCF residents. METHODS This is a cross-sectional analysis within a retrospective cohort of hospitalized patients≥75 years with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to 160 Spanish hospitals. Differences between groups and factors associated with mortality among LTCF residents were assessed through comparisons and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Of 6,189 patients≥75 years, 1,185 (19.1%) were LTCF residents and 4,548 (73.5%) were community-dwelling. LTCF residents were older (median: 87.4 vs. 82.1 years), mostly female (61.6% vs. 43.2%), had more severe functional dependence (47.0% vs 7.8%), more comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index: 6 vs 5), had dementia more often (59.1% vs. 14.4%), and had shorter duration of symptoms (median: 3 vs 6 days) than community-dwelling patients (all, p<.001). Mortality risk factors in LTCF residents were severe functional dependence (aOR:1.79;95%CI:1.13-2.83;p=.012), dyspnea (1.66;1.16-2.39;p=.004), SatO2<94% (1.73;1.27-2.37;p=.001), temperature≥37.8ºC (1.62;1.11-2.38; p=.013); qSOFA index≥2 (1.62;1.11-2.38;p=.013), bilateral infiltrates (1.98;1.24-2.98;p<.001), and high C-reactive protein (1.005;1.003-1.007;p<.001). In-hospital mortality was initially higher among LTCF residents (43.3% vs 39.7%), but lower after adjusting for sex, age, functional dependence, and comorbidities (aOR:0.74,95%CI:0.62-0.87;p<.001). CONCLUSION Basal functional status and COVID-19 severity are risk factors of mortality in LTCF residents. The lower adjusted mortality rate in LTCF residents may be explained by earlier identification, treatment, and hospitalization for COVID-19.","Ramos-Rincón, José-Manuel; Bernabeu-Whittel, Máximo; Fiteni-Mera, Isabel; López-Sampalo, Almudena; López-Ríos, Carmen; García-Andreu, María-Del-Mar; Mancebo-Sevilla, Juan-José; Jiménez-Juan, Carlos; Matía-Sanz, Marta; López-Quirantes, Pablo; Rubio-Rivas, Manuel; Paredes-Ruiz, Diana; González-San-Narciso, Candela; González-Vega, Rocío; Sanz-Espinosa, Pablo; Hernández-Milián, Almudena; Gonzalez-Noya, Amara; Gil-Sánchez, Ricardo; Boixeda, Ramon; Alcalá-Pedrajas, José-Nicolás; Palop-Cervera, Marta; Cortés-Rodríguez, Begoña; Guisado-Espartero, María-Esther; Mella-Pérez, Carmen; Gómez-Huelgas, Ricardo","The journals of gerontology.

We also evaluated the construction of an intrathoracic T-graft anastomosis using existing instrumentation of the SP system. METHODS We harvested bilateral ITAs from two male cadavers via a single incision made in the fifth intercostal space using the da Vinci SP. A T-graft end-to-side anastomosis was created in one cadaver. RESULTS The bilateral ITAs were harvested in less than 60 min and a T-graft was completed. No additional rib spreading was required. Intraoperative adjustments of the da Vinci SP were necessary to maintain alignment with the surgical targets. CONCLUSIONS Bilateral ITA harvest using the da Vinci SP through a single intercostal incision was feasible, with less rib spreading than in mini-thoracotomy procedures. Thus, creating an intrathoracic T-graft with the existing da Vinci SP instruments is possible.","Stein, Hubert; Falk, Volkmar",Surgery today,255,16

There is limited evidence exploring whether end-of-life symptom control in this group requires new or adapted guidance. AIM To review whether prescribing for symptom control in patients dying with COVID-19 adhered to existing local guidance or whether there was deviation which may represent a need for revised guidance or specialist support in particular patient groups. DESIGN/SETTING A retrospective review of the electronic patient record of 61 hospital inpatients referred to the specialist palliative care team with swab-confirmed COVID-19 who subsequently died over a 1-month period. Intubated patients were excluded. RESULTS In all, 83% (40/48) of patients were prescribed opioids at a starting dose consistent with existing local guidelines. In seven of eight patients where higher doses were prescribed, this was on specialist palliative care team advice. Mean total opioid dose required in the last 24 h of life was 14 mg morphine subcutaneous equivalent, and mean total midazolam dose was 9.5 mg. For three patients in whom non-invasive ventilation was in place higher doses were used. CONCLUSION Prescription of end-of-life symptom control drugs for COVID-19 fell within the existing guidance when supported by specialist palliative care advice. While some patients may require increased doses, routine prescription of higher starting opioid and benzodiazepine doses beyond existing local guidance was not observed.","Jackson, Timothy; Hobson, Katie; Clare, Hannah; Weegmann, Daniel; Moloughney, Catherine; McManus, Sally",Palliative medicine,255,1

Areas covered We hereby review the available literature pertaining to COVID-19 in IBD based on published consensus guidelines, expert opinions, case series, registries and reports. Expert opinion Preliminary data suggests no increase in incidence of COVID-19 in IBD patients as compared to general population. Morbidity and mortality rates attributable to COVID-19 are also similar in IBD patients as compared to general population. Though exact reason is unknown, some aspects of COVID -19 pathogenesis may explain this paradox. Medications for IBD need to be carefully reviewed during COVID-19 crisis. Steroids may need dose tapering or substitution to avoid complications based on anecdotal evidence. Endoscopic procedures for IBD maybe deferred unless absolutely necessary. General measures recommended for COVID-19 tailored to specific needs of IBD patients maybe the best way to prevent infection.

Despite these challenges, it is well known that suboptimal nutritional status is a strong independent predictor of poor postoperative outcomes. Although perioperative caregivers consistently express recognition of the importance of nutrition screening and optimization in the perioperative period, implementation of evidence-based perioperative nutrition guidelines and pathways in the United States has been quite limited and needs to be addressed in surgery-focused recommendations. The second Perioperative Quality Initiative brought together a group of international experts with the objective of providing consensus recommendations on this important topic with the goal of (1) developing guidelines for screening of nutritional status to identify patients at risk for adverse outcomes due to malnutrition; (2) address optimal methods of providing nutritional support and optimizing nutrition status preoperatively; and (3) identifying when and how to optimize nutrition delivery in the postoperative period. Discussion led to strong recommendations for implementation of routine preoperative nutrition screening to identify patients in need of preoperative nutrition optimization. Postoperatively, nutrition delivery should be restarted immediately after surgery. The key role of oral nutrition supplements, enteral nutrition, and parenteral nutrition (implemented in that order) in most perioperative patients was advocated for with protein delivery being more important than total calorie delivery. Finally, the role of often-inadequate nutrition intake in the posthospital setting was discussed, and the role of postdischarge oral nutrition supplements was emphasized.","Wischmeyer, Paul E; Carli, Franco; Evans, David C; Guilbert, Sarah; Kozar, Rosemary; Pryor, Aurora; Thiele, Robert H; Everett, Sotiria; Grocott, Mike; Gan, Tong J; Shaw, Andrew D; Thacker, Julie K M; Miller, Timothy E; Hedrick, Traci L; McEvoy, Matthew D; Mythen, Michael G; Bergamaschi, Roberto; Gupta, Ruchir; Holubar, Stefan D; Senagore, Anthony J; Abola, Ramon E; Bennett-Guerrero, Elliott; Kent, Michael L; Feldman, Liane S; Fiore, Julio F",Anesthesia and analgesia,255,12

An inclusive economic approach was conceptualised as a way to reduce these economic inequalities, although the attributes of this approach are unclear. Public health practitioners are increasingly asked to provide a health perspective on the economic recovery plans in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper aims to identify the attributes of an inclusive economy to enable the public health profession to influence an inclusive economic recovery. APPROACH We conducted a rapid review of grey and peer-reviewed literature to identify the attributes of an inclusive economy as currently defined in the literature. ATTRIBUTES OF AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY Twenty-two concepts were identified from 56 reports and articles. These were collapsed into four distinct attributes of an inclusive economy: (1) an economy that is designed to deliver inclusion and equity, (2) equitable distribution of the benefits from the economy (eg, assets, power, value), (3) equitable access to the resources needed to participate in the economy (eg, health, education), and (4) the economy operates within planetary boundaries. CONCLUSION As economies are (re)built following the COVID-19 pandemic, these attributes of an inclusive economy-based on the current literature-can be used to develop, and then monitor progress of, economic policy that will reduce health inequalities, improve health and mitigate against climate change.","Shipton, Deborah; Sarica, Shifa; Craig, Neil; McCartney, Gerry; Katikireddi, Srinivasa Vittal; Roy, Graeme; McGregor, Peter; Scobie, Graeme",Journal of epidemiology and community health,255,1

However, clinical decision-making and health management policies often are based additionally on cycle threshold (Ct) values (i.e., quantitative results) to guide patient care, segregation and discharge management of individuals testing positive. Therefore, an analysis of inter-protocol variability is needed to assess the comparability of the quantitative results. Methods Ct values reported in a SARS-CoV-2 virus genome detection external quality assessment challenge were analyzed. Three positive and two negative samples were distributed to participating test laboratories. Qualitative results (positive/negative) and quantitative results (Ct values) were assessed. Results A total of 66 laboratories participated, contributing results from 101 distinct test systems and reporting Ct values for a total of 92 different protocols. In all three positive samples, the means of the Ct values for the E-, N-, S-, RdRp-, and ORF1ab-genes varied by less than two cycles. However, 7.7% of reported results deviated by more than ±4.0 (maximum 18.0) cycles from the respective individual means. These larger deviations appear to be systematic errors. Conclusions In an attempt to use PCR diagnostics beyond the identification of infected individuals, laboratories are frequently requested to report Ct values along with a qualitative result. This study highlights the limitations of interpreting Ct values from the various SARS-CoV genome detection protocols and suggests that standardization is necessary in the reporting of Ct values with respect to the target gene.","Buchta, Christoph; Görzer, Irene; Chiba, Peter; Camp, Jeremy V; Holzmann, Heidemarie; Puchhammer-Stöckl, Elisabeth; Mayerhofer, Maximilian; Müller, Mathias M; Aberle, Stephan W",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,255,5

Logistic regression analysis was performed and the proportion of treatment effect explained by BMD in vertebral fracture risk was estimated. The results demonstrate that both total hip BMD T-score and change can be strong predictors of subsequent fracture risk, and that total hip BMD change explained 73%, while T-score explained 23%, of the treatment effect. In contrast, neither femoral neck BMD change nor T-score can predict the effect of denosumab on vertebral fracture risk. Furthermore, although lumbar spine BMD T-score was associated with vertebral fracture incidence, lumbar spine BMD change was inversely related to vertebral fracture risk. Because there was no relationship between lumbar spine BMD change and T-score at 24 months of denosumab treatment, and because there can be small undetectable vertebral deformities that may increase BMD values, these results suggest that lumbar spine BMD change is not a good surrogate for vertebral fracture risk assessment. It is suggested that both total hip BMD change and T-score can be good surrogates for predicting vertebral fracture risk in Japanese patients with osteoporosis under denosumab treatment.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00680953.","Okubo, Naoki; Matsui, Shigeyuki; Matsumoto, Toshio; Sugimoto, Toshitsugu; Hosoi, Takayuki; Osakabe, Taisuke; Watanabe, Ko; Takami, Hideo; Shiraki, Masataka; Nakamura, Toshitaka",Calcified tissue international,255,1

The scarcity of parenthood-loneliness inquiries leaves a gap in our understanding of new parenthood and its effects on the health and well-being of parents and their children. Here, a scoping review protocol will be presented to address this gap. The objective of this study will be to summarize the current knowledge of loneliness experienced during pregnancy and by parents during the postpartum period through the first 5 years of the child's life. METHODS A scoping review protocol was designed following Arksey and O'Malley's framework. We will include all types of literature in English, including all study designs, reviews, opinion articles, dissertations, reports, books, and grey literature. To be considered for inclusion, sources should focus on loneliness in pregnant persons, postpartum people, and parents of children 5 years or younger. We will search the following electronic databases (from inception onwards): MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Dissertations & Theses Global, Sociological Abstracts, Scopus, and Web of Science. Grey literature will be identified searching the British governmental website gov.uk, the Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness, the Campaign to End Loneliness, and the British Red Cross's Action on Loneliness websites. Two reviewers, working independently of each other, will screen the titles and abstracts of the articles returned by the searches, then screen the selected full-text articles, and extract data. A third reviewer will cast the deciding vote in case no consensus is reached. Results will be given in the narrative form, mapped, and illustrated. DISCUSSION This scoping review will capture the state of the current literature on loneliness in pregnancy and new parenthood. Results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. We anticipate that the study will identify gaps and make recommendations for future areas of study and related interventions.

A fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed before and after the suctioning maneuver, looking for the presence of blue dye in the folds within the cuff wall or in the trachea under the cuff. The sealing of the cuff was defined by the absence of leakage of blue dye either in the cuff wall or in the trachea under the cuff. RESULTS Twenty-five patients were included. The size of the tracheal tube was 7-mm ID for 5 patients, 7.5-mm ID for 16 patients, and 8-mm ID for four patients. Blue dye was never seen in the trachea under the cuff before suctioning and only in one patient (4%) after the suctioning maneuver. Blue dye was observed in the folds within the cuff wall in 6 of 25 patients before suctioning and 11 of 25 after (p = 0.063). Overall, the incidence of sealing of the cuff was 76% before suctioning and 56% after (p = 0.073). CONCLUSIONS In patients intubated with a PVC-cuffed tracheal tube and under mechanical ventilation with PEEP ≥5 cm H2O and a cuff pressure set at 30 cm H2O, a single tracheal suctioning maneuver did not increase the risk of aspiration in the trachea under the cuff.

The data for the current study were collected as part of the second International Self-Report Delinquency Study (ISRD-II). A total of 49,685 individuals from 30 countries are nested within 1,427 schools. We use multilevel generalized linear regression models with violent victimization (robbery and assault) regressed on demographic, family, school, and neighborhood variables. Multiplicative interaction terms are included in separate models to examine key moderation effects consistent with expectations drawn from the victimization literature. Analyses reveal that low self-control and perceptions of school disorganization are both associated with an increase in the odds of experiencing victimization. Interactions between low self-control and school disorganization are also found to be consistent with saturation/social push models. Our regulation approach offers a foundation for theorizing about ETV and provides a testable model for future research. However, elements of the regulation model are in need of further refinement and testing before the perspective can be moved toward a broader theory of victimization.","Posick, Chad; Rocque, Michael",Journal of interpersonal violence,255,16

There have been several studies that address the implication of drinking animal milk and/or infant formula on children's health and development when breast feeding is not offered during the first year of life. Vast improvements have been made in infant formula design, which may increase its benefits compared with animal's milk. The objective of this review is therefore to synthesise the most recent evidence on the effects of the consumption of animal milk compared with infant formula in non-breastfed or mixed breastfed infants aged 6-11 months. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that assessed the effect of animal milk compared with formula or mixed-fed (breastmilk and formula) on infants aged 6-11 months. The primary outcomes of interest include anaemia, gastrointestinal blood loss, weight for age, height for age and weight for height. We will include randomised and non-randomised studies with a control group. We will use the Cochrane risk of bias tools to assess the risk of bias. We will use meta-analysis to pool findings if the identified studies are conceptually homogenous and data are available from more than one study. We will assess the overall quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This is a systematic review, so no patients will be directly involved in the design or development of this study. The findings from this systematic review will be disseminated to relevant patient populations and caregivers and will guide the WHO's recommendations on formula consumption versus animal milk in infants aged 6-11 months.

Materials and Methods Lectin-modified macromolecular lipid magnetic spheres were prepared by thin-film hydration method using lentil lectin derivatives (LCA-HQ) and cholesterol as raw materials. Alpha-fetoprotein variants (AFP-L3) in serum from healthy people, liver disease and liver cancer patients were isolated using the prepared lectin-modified macromolecular lipid magnetic spheres, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and AFP-L3 were detected by fully automatic time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay. Results The lectin polymer lipid magnetic sphere prepared in this study was superparamagnetic and encapsulated by a lectin derivative. There was no significant difference in the recovery rate of AFP-L3 between avidin magnetic ball-automatic time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay and manual micro-affinity column method (p>0.05). We found that AFP-L3 can be used as a differential indicator between liver cancer and liver disease. The positive rate of AFP and AFP-L3 in liver cancer patients was higher than that in healthy people and liver disease patients (p<0.001). The AUC (95% CI) of AFP and AFP-L3 were 0.743 ± 0.031 and 0.850 ± 0.024, respectively. AFP-L3 AUC value is greater than AFP; therefore, AFP-L3 distinguishes liver cancer more accurately, and the difference is statistically different, p<0.05. Conclusion We proposed a novel method for integration of the lectin polymer lipid magnetic spheres and time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay that enables simple, accurate and rapid determination of AFP-L3 in clinical samples. To be noted, fully automatic time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay compared with the commonly used techniques in clinical practice, the measurement procedure is simple and is expected to be used for the detection and accurate diagnosis of liver cancer.","Wang, Kai; Li, Yuzhong; Wang, Xiaowei; Jiao, Jianpeng; Li, Ying; Gu, Wenyue; Liang, Xiaofei",International journal of nanomedicine,255,26

The ecological and evolutionary dynamics of infections play out on a wide range of interconnected temporal, organizational, and spatial scales, which span hours to months, cells to ecosystems, and local to global spread. Moreover, some pathogens are directly transmitted between individuals of a single species, whereas others circulate among multiple hosts, need arthropod vectors, or can survive in environmental reservoirs. Many factors, including increasing antimicrobial resistance, increased human connectivity and changeable human behavior, elevate prevention and control from matters of national policy to international challenge.

Although Israeli hospital preparedness has been the subject of international praise and attention, there has been a dearth of research focused specifically on applying Israeli hospital security measures to the US hospital setting to augment emergency planning. OBJECTIVE This study examined practical and cost-effective lessons from the Israeli experience for improving US hospital security preparedness for a wide range of mass casualty incidents, both natural and man-made. DESIGN Sixty semi-structured interviews were conducted with officials throughout Israel's and America's health, defense, and emergency response communities. Hospital preparedness was examined and disaster drills were evaluated in both countries, with San Francisco hospitals analyzed as a case study. Qualitative analysis was conducted and recommendations were made on the basis of an all-hazards approach to emergency preparedness. RESULTS US hospitals examined in this study had not undertaken crucial preparations for managing the security consequences of a large-scale disaster. Recommendations from Israel included installing permanent emergency signage, improving security perimeter protocols and training, increasing defense against primary and secondary attacks, enhancing coordination with law enforcement, the National Guard, and other outside security agencies, and conducting more frequent and realistic lockdown exercises. CONCLUSIONS A number of US hospitals have overlooked the important role of security in emergency preparedness. This study analyzed practical and cost-effective security recommendations from Israel to remedy this dangerous deficiency in some US hospitals' disaster planning.","Golabek-Goldman, Michele",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,255,12

We therefore set out to test communication strategies to promote social distancing. OBJECTIVE We aimed to test two novel public health messages against a control message. The first was designed to exploit the ""identifiable victim"" effect by highlighting the risk of transmission to identifiable vulnerable persons. The second sought to counteract intuitive underestimation of exponential transmission. METHOD In total, 500 Irish adults undertook a pre-registered, online experiment. They were randomly assigned to a control group or one of two treatment groups. The control group viewed a current poster that encouraged a 2-m separation between people. The two treatment groups saw posters of similar design, but with narrative messages describing how an individual had infected a specific vulnerable person or multiple other people. Later questions measured intentions to undertake three specific types of social interaction over the coming days and the stated acceptability of three other types of social interaction. Pilot work had identified these six behaviors as ""marginal"" - people were unsure whether they were advisable. RESULTS Participants in the treatment conditions were more cautious about undertaking the behaviors and less accepting of them. This positive effect occurred despite participants rating the treatment posters as likely to be less effective and memorable than the control poster. CONCLUSIONS Messages that invoke thoughts of infecting vulnerable people or large numbers of people can motivate social distancing and, hence, help to limit the spread of COVID-19. Stated public evaluations (obtained via focus groups or surveys) may underestimate the actual effectiveness of such emotional messages.","Lunn, Peter D; Timmons, Shane; Belton, Cameron A; Barjaková, Martina; Julienne, Hannah; Lavin, Ciarán",Social science & medicine,255,1

This study aimed to assess level of stress, anxiety, depression and their associated factors among health care workers during Corona virus disease 2019 pandemic in Nepal. METHODS This is a web based cross-sectional survey conducted among 404 Health Care Workers during early phase of Corona virus disease 2019 pandemic. The participants were selected using convenience sampling technique and were invited to participate via various online networks. Depression, anxiety and stress were assessed using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and their associated factors were measured using structured questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression was carried out to determine the associated factors. RESULTS The symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression among health care workers were found to be 28.9%, 35.6% and 17.0% respectively. Females were found to be 2 fold more likely to have anxiety and depression than male. Nurses were found to be two times more likely to have anxiety than doctors. Laboratory personnel were almost three folds more likely to have anxiety than doctors. Health care workers with insufficient/ no PPE were almost three fold more likely to have depression. health care workers working in high-risk areas had almost 2 fold higher odds of having depression. CONCLUSIONS Health care workers experienced symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression in varied level of severity. This experience was higher among the nurses and laboratory workers than doctors. Pandemic preparedness assuring PPE and appropriate psychological interventions may be beneficial to promote mental health and well-being of health care workers.","Pandey, Apsara; Sharma, Chandrakala; Chapagain, Ram Hari; Devkota, Narmada; Ranabhat, Kamal; Pant, Suman; Adhikari, Kriti",Journal of Nepal Health Research Council,255,1

In countries without a nationwide cancer registry, an additional issue is estimating national incidence from local-registry data. The objectives of this study were to (i) promote the use of multidimensional penalized splines (MPS) for trend analyses; (ii) estimate the national cancer-incidence trends, using MPS, from only local-registry data; and (iii) propose a validation process of these estimates. METHODS We used an MPS model of age and year for trend analyses in France over 1990-2015 with a projection up to 2018. Validation was performed for 22 cancer sites and relied essentially on comparison with reference estimates that used the incidence/health-care ratio over the period 2011-2015. Alternative estimates that used the incidence/mortality ratio were also used to validate the trends. RESULTS In the validation assessment, the relative differences of the incidence estimates (2011-2015) with the reference estimates were <5% except for testis cancer in men and < 7% except for larynx cancer in women. Trends could be correctly derived since 1990 despite incomplete histories in some registries. The proposed method was applied to estimate the incidence and mortality trends of female lung cancer and prostate cancer in France. CONCLUSIONS The validation process confirmed the validity of the national French estimates; it may be applied in other countries to help in choosing the most appropriate national estimation method according to country-specific contexts. MPS form a powerful statistical tool for trend analyses; they allow trends to vary smoothly with age and are suitable for modelling simple as well as complex trends thanks to penalization. Detailed trend analyses of lung and prostate cancers illustrated the suitability of MPS and the epidemiological interest of such analyses.","Uhry, Zoé; Chatignoux, Edouard; Dantony, Emmanuelle; Colonna, Marc; Roche, Laurent; Fauvernier, Mathieu; Defossez, Gautier; Leguyader-Peyrou, Sandra; Monnereau, Alain; Grosclaude, Pascale; Bossard, Nadine; Remontet, Laurent",International journal of epidemiology,255,27

Multidisciplinary discussions of surgical resectability and medical operability determine the modality of definitive local treatment (surgery or radiotherapy) and the associated systemic therapies to further improve the likelihood of cure. Trial evidence supports cisplatin-based adjuvant therapy either after surgical resection or concurrently with radiotherapy. Consensus guidelines support neoadjuvant chemotherapy in lieu of adjuvant chemotherapy and carboplatin-based regimens for patients who are ineligible for cisplatin. The incorporation of newer agents, now standard for patients with stage IV lung cancer, into the curative therapy paradigm has lagged owing to inefficient trial designs, the lengthy follow-up needed to assess survival end points and a developmental focus on the advanced-stage disease setting. Surrogate end points, such as pathological response, are being studied and might shorten trial durations. In 2018, the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab was approved for patients with stage III lung cancer after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Since then, the study of targeted therapies and immunotherapies in patients with early-stage lung cancer has rapidly expanded.

Various treatment options have been suggested but no definitive treatment regimen has been established. The aim of our study is to report leak complications after LSG, their management, and outcomes. METHODS Between June 2008 and October 2013, a total of 539 patients underwent laparoscopic and robot-assisted laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy at our institution. A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was performed for all LSG patients, noting the outcomes and complications of the procedure. RESULTS Fifteen (2.8%) patients presented with a leak after LSG. The diagnosis was made at a mean of 27.2±29.9 days (range, 1-102) after LSG. Eight (53.3%) patients underwent conservative treatment initially and 6 (75.0%) of these patients required stenting as secondary treatment. Although leaks from 3 patients resolved with stenting, the other 3 required restenting and 2 eventually underwent conversion to gastric bypass. Five (33.3%) patients underwent endoscopic intervention, closing the leak with fibrin glue (n=3) or hemoclips (n=2). Two (13.3%) patients who were diagnosed with a leak immediately after LSG before discharge had their leak oversewn laparoscopically with an omental patch. Leaks in 9 (60.0%) patients did not heal after the first intervention, and the mean number of intervention required was 2.3±1.7 times (range, 1-7) for the treatment of this condition. CONCLUSION Management of leaks after LSG can be challenging. Early diagnosis and treatment is important in the management of a leak. However, it can be treated safely via various management options depending on the time of diagnosis and size of the leak.","Moon, Rena C; Shah, Nimesh; Teixeira, Andre F; Jawad, Muhammad A",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,255,1

The objective of the present study was to examine the behavior and ultrastructure of gonocytes in culture. Neonatal porcine testis cells were cultured for 4 weeks and underwent live-cell imaging to explore real-time interactions among cultured cells. This included imaging every 1 h from day 0 to day 3, every 2 h from day 4 to day 7, and every 1 h for 24 h at days 14, 21, and 28. Samples also underwent scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, morphometric evaluations, immunofluorescence, and RT-PCR. Live-cell imaging revealed an active amoeboid-like movement of gonocytes, assisted by the formation of extensive cytoplasmic projections, which, using scanning electron microscopy, were categorized into spike-like filopodia, leaf-like lamellipodia, membrane ruffles, and cytoplasmic blebs. In the first week of culture, gonocytes formed loose attachments on top of a somatic cell monolayer and, in week 2, formed grape-like clusters, which, over time, grew in cell number. Starting at week 3 of culture, some of the gonocyte clusters transformed into large multinucleated embryoid body-like colonies (EBLCs) that expressed both gonocyte- and pluripotent-specific markers. The number and diameter of individual gonocytes, the number and density of organelles within gonocytes, as well as the number and diameter of the EBLCs increased over time (P < 0.05). In conclusion, cultured porcine gonocytes displayed extensive migratory behavior facilitated by their various cytoplasmic projections, propagated, and transformed into EBLCs that increased in size and complexity over time.","Awang-Junaidi, Awang Hazmi; Fayaz, Mohammad Amin; Kawamura, Eiko; Sobchishin, LaRhonda; MacPhee, Daniel J; Honaramooz, Ali",Cell and tissue research,255,15

EXPOSURE Anterior circulation proximal intracranial arterial occlusion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Frequency of good outcome (defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of ≤ 2) and mortality at 6 months. RESULTS A total of 126 patients with a unilateral complete occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA; 26 patients: median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score, 11 [interquartile range, 5-17]), of the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA; 52 patients: median NIHSS score, 13 [interquartile range, 6-16]), or of the M2 segment of the MCA (48 patients: median NIHSS score, 7 [interquartile range, 4-15]) were included. Of these 3 groups of patients, 10 (38.5%), 20 (38.5%), and 26 (54.2%) with ICA, MCA-M1, and MCA-M2 occlusions, respectively, achieved a modified Rankin Scale score of 2 or less, and 6 (23.1%), 12 (23.1%), and 10 (20.8%) were dead at 6 months. Worse outcomes were seen in patients with a baseline NIHSS score of 10 or higher, with a modified Rankin Scale score of 2 or less achieved in only 7.1% (1 of 14), 23.5% (8 of 34), and 22.7% (5 of 22) of patients and mortality rates of 35.7% (5 of 14), 32.4% (11 of 34), and 40.9% (9 of 22) among patients with ICA, MCA-M1, and MCA-M2 occlusions, respectively. Age (odds ratio, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.91-0.98]), NIHSS score (odds ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.64-0.83]), and strength of leptomeningeal collaterals (odds ratio, 2.37 [95% CI, 1.08-5.20]) were independently associated with outcome, whereas the level of proximal intracranial arterial occlusion (ICA vs MCA-M1 vs MCA-M2) was not. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The natural history of proximal intracranial arterial occlusion is variable, with poor outcomes overall. Stroke severity and collateral flow appear to be more important than the level of proximal intracranial arterial occlusion in determining outcomes.

The results revealed that 253 genes were differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (170 genes were upregulated, and 83 were downregulated) and more than 100 DEGs were probably associated with intramuscular fat deposition, tenderness, and toughness, which are driving the meat quality and were involved in biological processes such as collagen synthesis, cell differentiation, and muscle tissue and fiber development; molecular functions such as chemokine activity and collagen activity; cellular components such as cytoplasm and myofibril; and pathways such as collagen signaling and metabolic pathways. A gene-act network and a co-expression network revealed the close relationship between intramuscular fat deposition and meat tenderness. The expressions of 20 DEGs were validated by real-time PCR, and the results suggested that the DEGs are correlated with RNA-seq data and play crucial roles in muscle growth, development processes, toughness, and tenderness of the meat.

METHODS Individual semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted from January 2020-February 2020 with 10 nurses who were isolated at home sharing the experiences of the epidemic of COVID-19. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analysed using constant comparative data analysis. RESULTS Analyses of the collected data reveal that the psychological changes of nurses during home isolation reflect a complex, dynamic, and gradually adaptive process that was affected by many factors. Nurses had many negative emotional reactions in the early stages of isolation and positive emotions gradually increased during home isolation. After release from home isolation, they become more confident and calm after. Six categories of coping strategies were identified, including reasoned cognition; autosuggestion; develop healthy protective behaviours; shifting attention; social support; and the power of a role model. CONCLUSIONS The study provides a better understanding of the psychological changes and the coping strategies used among nurses isolated at home. It is necessary to pay more attention to negative emotions in the early stages of home isolation to help nurses adjust quickly. The coping strategies used by nurses are likely to help those in home isolation reduce negative psychological changes and experience more optimal self-adjustment. IMPACT This study explored the psychological changes and coping strategies of home isolation among nurses, providing useful advice for psychologists to develop psychological crisis interventions to help individuals reduce negative psychological and have more actively coping strategies when faced sudden stressful infectious diseases.","Zhang, Mao-Mao; Niu, Niu; Zhi, Xiao-Xu; Zhu, Ping; Wu, Bing; Wu, Bai-Nv; Meng, Ai-Feng; Zhao, Yun",Journal of advanced nursing,255,24

For this reason, there is a growing need to characterize economic models more representative of the negative effects and counteracting responses that irradiation causes on human skin. These models will serve for the screening of protective compounds against damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) and high energy visible light (HEV). Therefore, two common in vitro models employed for sunlight irradiation studies, namely human keratinocyte HaCat culture and reconstructed human epidermis (RHE), were compared with the medaka fish embryo model, traditionally used in other scientific disciplines. Using suberythemal doses of UVA and HEV to determine the level of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation and thymine dimers formed by UVB, we show that medaka embryo responds with a lower damage level, more comparable to human skin, than the other two models, probably due to the protective mechanisms that work in a complete organism. In the same way, the protective effects of antioxidant compounds have the greatest effect on medaka embryos. Taken together, these findings suggest that medaka embryos would be a good alternative in vitro model for sunlight effect studies, and for the screening of molecules with counteracting capacity against the damage caused by UV and HEV.","Merino, Marián; Mullor, José Luis; Sánchez-Sánchez, Ana Virginia",International journal of molecular sciences,255,1

Here, we have successfully synthesized hierarchical structures (Ni3B/Ni(BO2)2@NixCoyMoO4) by boronizing NixCoyMoO4 nanosheets on flexible carbon cloth substrates. Benefitting from the synergistic effect among Ni3B, Ni(BO2)2 and NixCoyMoO4 in hybrid architectures, the electrode material possesses higher capacity of 394.7 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 and a good rate performance (309.5 mA h g-1 maintained at 20 A g-1). Then, a hybrid supercapacitor assembled with Ni3B/Ni(BO2)2@NixCoyMoO4 and activated carbon as the positive and the negative electrode, displays a high specific capacitance of 370.7 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 (210 F g-1 at 10 A g-1), a high voltage of 1.7 V, and a high energy density of 131.8 W h kg-1 at the power density of 800 W kg-1 (still 74.7 W h kg-1 maintained at 8000 W kg-1).

The goal of the current systematic review was to identify the existing literature investigating performance of predictive models for the development of paediatric ED following general anaesthesia and to determine their usability. DESIGN Systematic review using the Prediction model study Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) framework. DATA SOURCES Medline (Ovid), PubMed, Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Ovid), Cochrane CENTRAL (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Scopus (Elsevier) and Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ProQuest Digital Dissertations and Theses International through 17 November 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES All randomised controlled trials and cohort studies investigating predictive models for the development of ED in children undergoing general anaesthesia. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Following title, abstract and full-text screening by two reviewers, data were extracted from all eligible studies, including demographic parameters, details of anaesthetics and performance characteristics of the predictive scores for ED. Evidence quality and predictive score usability were assessed according to the PROBAST framework. RESULTS The current systematic review yielded 9242 abstracts, of which only one study detailing the development and validation of the Emergence Agitation Risk Scale (EARS) met the inclusion criteria. EARS had good discrimination with c-index of 0.81 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.89). Calibration showed a non-significant Homer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test (p=0.97). Although the EARS demonstrated low concern of applicability, the high risk of bias compromised the overall usability of this model. CONCLUSIONS The current systematic review concluded that EARS has good discrimination performance but low usability to predict ED in a paediatric population. Further research is warranted to develop novel models for the prediction of ED in paediatric anaesthesia.

Embryonic genotype and level of inbreeding are among the many factors that can play a role on reproductive efficiency. To investigate this issue, we produced purebred and crossbred bovine embryos by in vitro techniques from Holstein oocytes and Holstein or Brown Swiss semen and analyzed several cellular and molecular features. In the first experiment, purebred and crossbred embryos, obtained from abattoir oocytes, were analyzed for cleavage, development to morula/blastocyst stages, amino acid metabolism and gene expression of developmentally important genes. The results indicated significant differences in the percentage of compacted morulae, in the expression of three genes at the blastocyst stage (MNSOD, GP130 and FGF4) and in the utilization of serine, asparagine, methionine and tryptophan in day 6 embryos. In the second experiment, bovine oocytes were collected by ovum pick up from ten Holstein donors and fertilized with the semen of the respective Holstein sires or with Brown Swiss semen. The derived embryos were grown in vitro up to day 7, and were then transferred to synchronized recipients and recovered on day 12. We found that purebred/inbred embryos had lower blastocyst rate on days 7-8, were smaller on day 12 and had lower expression of the trophoblast gene PLAC8. Overall, these results indicate reduced and delayed development of purebred embryos compared with crossbred embryos. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that embryo genotype and high inbreeding can affect amino acid metabolism, gene expression, preimplantation development and therefore fertility in cattle.","Lazzari, G; Colleoni, S; Duchi, R; Galli, A; Houghton, F D; Galli, C",Reproduction,255,9

OM refers to inflammation of the middle ear and can be broadly classified into two types, acute and chronic. Bacterial infection is one of the most common causes of OM. Despite the introduction of vaccines, the incidence of OM remains significantly high worldwide. In this mini-review article, we discuss the recent treatment modalities for OM, such as suspension gel, transcutaneous immunization, and intranasal and transtympanic drug delivery, including therapies that are currently undergoing clinical trials. We provide an overview of how these recent advancements in therapeutic strategies can facilitate the circumvention of current treatment challenges involving preadolescence soft palate dysfunction, biofilm formation, tympanic membrane (ear drum) barrier and the attainment of efficacious drug concentrations in the middle ear. While traditional first-line immunization strategies are generally not very efficacious against biofilms, new technologies that use transdermal or intranasal drug delivery via chitosan-PsaA nanoparticles have shown promising results in experimental animal models of OM. Sustained drug delivery systems such as penta-block copolymer poloxamer 407-polybutylphosphoester (P407-PBP) or poloxamer 407 (e.g. OTO-201, with the brand name 'OTIPRIO') have demonstrated that treatments can be reduced to a single topical application. The emergence of effective new treatment modalities opens up promising new avenues for the treatment of OM that could lead to improved quality of life for many children and their families.","Mittal, Rahul; Parrish, James M; Soni, Manasi; Mittal, Jeenu; Mathee, Kalai",Journal of medical microbiology,255,1

Examples are influenza (H1N1) caused by the H1N1pdm09 virus in 2009, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 2019. Antiviral drugs and vaccines may be insufficient to prevent their spread. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011. The evidence summarised in this review does not include results from studies from the current COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL on 1 April 2020. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP on 16 March 2020. We conducted a backwards and forwards citation analysis on the newly included studies. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs of trials investigating physical interventions (screening at entry ports, isolation, quarantine, physical distancing, personal protection, hand hygiene, face masks, and gargling) to prevent respiratory virus transmission. In previous versions of this review we also included observational studies. However, for this update, there were sufficient RCTs to address our study aims. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. Three pairs of review authors independently extracted data using a standard template applied in previous versions of this review, but which was revised to reflect our focus on RCTs and cluster-RCTs for this update. We did not contact trialists for missing data due to the urgency in completing the review. We extracted data on adverse events (harms) associated with the interventions. MAIN RESULTS We included 44 new RCTs and cluster-RCTs in this update, bringing the total number of randomised trials to 67. There were no included studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Six ongoing studies were identified, of which three evaluating masks are being conducted concurrent with the COVID pandemic, and one is completed. Many studies were conducted during non-epidemic influenza periods, but several studies were conducted during the global H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, and others in epidemic influenza seasons up to 2016. Thus, studies were conducted in the context of lower respiratory viral circulation and transmission compared to COVID-19. The included studies were conducted in heterogeneous settings, ranging from suburban schools to hospital wards in high-income countries; crowded inner city settings in low-income countries; and an immigrant neighbourhood in a high-income country. Compliance with interventions was low in many studies. The risk of bias for the RCTs and cluster-RCTs was mostly high or unclear. Medical/surgical masks compared to no masks We included nine trials (of which eight were cluster-RCTs) comparing medical/surgical masks versus no masks to prevent the spread of viral respiratory illness (two trials with healthcare workers and seven in the community). There is low certainty evidence from nine trials (3507 participants) that wearing a mask may make little or no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness (ILI) compared to not wearing a mask (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.18. There is moderate certainty evidence that wearing a mask probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza compared to not wearing a mask (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.26; 6 trials; 3005 participants). Harms were rarely measured and poorly reported. Two studies during COVID-19 plan to recruit a total of 72,000 people. One evaluates medical/surgical masks (N = 6000) (published Annals of Internal Medicine, 18 Nov 2020), and one evaluates cloth masks (N = 66,000). N95/P2 respirators compared to medical/surgical masks We pooled trials comparing N95/P2 respirators with medical/surgical masks (four in healthcare settings and one in a household setting). There is uncertainty over the effects of N95/P2 respirators when compared with medical/surgical masks on the outcomes of clinical respiratory illness (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.10; very low-certainty evidence; 3 trials; 7779 participants) and ILI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.03; low-certainty evidence; 5 trials; 8407 participants). The evidence is limited by imprecision and heterogeneity for these subjective outcomes. The use of a N95/P2 respirator compared to a medical/surgical mask probably makes little or no difference for the objective and more precise outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.34; moderate-certainty evidence; 5 trials; 8407 participants). Restricting the pooling to healthcare workers made no difference to the overall findings. Harms were poorly measured and reported, but discomfort wearing medical/surgical masks or N95/P2 respirators was mentioned in several studies. One ongoing study recruiting 576 people compares N95/P2 respirators with medical surgical masks for healthcare workers during COVID-19. Hand hygiene compared to control Settings included schools, childcare centres, homes, and offices. In a comparison of hand hygiene interventions with control (no intervention), there was a 16% relative reduction in the number of people with ARIs in the hand hygiene group (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.86; 7 trials; 44,129 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), suggesting a probable benefit. When considering the more strictly defined outcomes of ILI and laboratory-confirmed influenza, the estimates of effect for ILI (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.13; 10 trials; 32,641 participants; low-certainty evidence) and laboratory-confirmed influenza (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.30; 8 trials; 8332 participants; low-certainty evidence) suggest the intervention made little or no difference. We pooled all 16 trials (61,372 participants) for the composite outcome of ARI or ILI or influenza, with each study only contributing once and the most comprehensive outcome reported. The pooled data showed that hand hygiene may offer a benefit with an 11% relative reduction of respiratory illness (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.95; low-certainty evidence), but with high heterogeneity. Few trials measured and reported harms. There are two ongoing studies of handwashing interventions in 395 children outside of COVID-19. We identified one RCT on quarantine/physical distancing. Company employees in Japan were asked to stay at home if household members had ILI symptoms. Overall fewer people in the intervention group contracted influenza compared with workers in the control group (2.75% versus 3.18%; hazard ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.97). However, those who stayed at home with their infected family members were 2.17 times more likely to be infected. We found no RCTs on eye protection, gowns and gloves, or screening at entry ports. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The high risk of bias in the trials, variation in outcome measurement, and relatively low compliance with the interventions during the studies hamper drawing firm conclusions and generalising the findings to the current COVID-19 pandemic. There is uncertainty about the effects of face masks. The low-moderate certainty of the evidence means our confidence in the effect estimate is limited, and that the true effect may be different from the observed estimate of the effect. The pooled results of randomised trials did not show a clear reduction in respiratory viral infection with the use of medical/surgical masks during seasonal influenza. There were no clear differences between the use of medical/surgical masks compared with N95/P2 respirators in healthcare workers when used in routine care to reduce respiratory viral infection. Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness. Harms associated with physical interventions were under-investigated. There is a need for large, well-designed RCTs addressing the effectiveness of many of these interventions in multiple settings and populations, especially in those most at risk of ARIs.","Jefferson, Tom; Del Mar, Chris B; Dooley, Liz; Ferroni, Eliana; Al-Ansary, Lubna A; Bawazeer, Ghada A; van Driel, Mieke L; Jones, Mark A; Thorning, Sarah; Beller, Elaine M; Clark, Justin; Hoffmann, Tammy C; Glasziou, Paul P; Conly, John M",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,255,17

METHODS We used data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health 2014-2017 which included 2,888 pregnant women 18 years or older. The WHODAS instrument was utilized to measure disability as the degree of functional impairment due to emotional/behavioral problems experienced by the respondent. Multinomial logistic regression models were built to assess the magnitude and direction of the association between severity of mental health-related disability with opioid use and abuse/dependency in the past year. RESULTS Approximately 30% of pregnant women suffered from moderate/severe mental health-related disability, and 2% reported opioid abuse/dependency. Compared to those with no opioid use, the odds of opioid use in the past year for individuals with moderate/severe mental health-related disability were 1.73 (95% CI 1.36, 2.21) times higher than those with no/mild disability. Similarly, the odds of opioid abuse/dependency were at least three times higher (OR 3.51; 95% CI 1.80, 6.84) among those with moderate/severe mental health-related disability relative to pregnant women with no/mild disability. CONCLUSIONS Clinicians should consider screening for both opioid use and mental health conditions and related disabilities using screening tools such as the WHODAS during the initial prenatal visits.","Kitsantas, Panagiota; Adams, Amy R; Cheema, Jehanzeb; Kornides, Melanie L",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,255,16

Presently, this has been applied for modelling the tertiary structure of highly conserved eukaryotic TCTP (translationally controlled tumour protein) which is involved in a plethora of functions during growth and development and also acts as a biomarker for many cancers like lung, breast, and prostate cancer. The modelled TCTP structures of different organisms belonging to the eukaryotic group showed similar spatial arrangement of structural units except loops and similar patterns of root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation, and radius of gyration (Rg) inspected through molecular dynamics simulations. Essential dynamics (ED) analyses revealed different domains that exhibited different motions for the assistance in its multifunctional properties. Construction of a free-energy landscape (FEL) based on Rg versus RMSD was employed to characterize the folding behaviours of structures and observe that all proteins had nearly similar conformation and topologies, indicating common thermodynamic/kinetic pathways. A physico-chemical interaction study demonstrated the helices and sheets were well stabilized with ample amounts of bonding compared to turns or loops and charged residues were more accessible to solvent molecules. Hence, the current study reveals the important structural features of TCTP that aid in diverse functions in a wide range of organisms, thus extending our knowledge of TCTP and also providing a venue for designing the potent inhibitors against it.","Kumar, Rakesh; Saran, Shweta",Journal of molecular modeling,255,20

Although excessive vasoconstriction may be harmful, these agents may help reduce administration of potentially harmful resuscitation fluids. This systematic review aims to compare early vasopressor use to standard resuscitation in adults with trauma-induced shock. DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov and the Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception until October 2016, as well as the proceedings of 10 relevant international conferences from 2005 to 2016. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Randomised controlled trials and controlled observational studies that compared the early vasopressor use with standard resuscitation in adults with acute traumatic injury. RESULTS Of 8001 citations, we retrieved 18 full-text articles and included 6 studies (1 randomised controlled trial and 5 observational studies), including 2 published exclusively in abstract form. Across observational studies, vasopressor use was associated with increased short-term mortality, with unadjusted risk ratios ranging from 2.31 to 7.39. However, the risk of bias was considered high in these observational studies because patients who received vasopressors were systematically sicker than patients treated without vasopressors. One clinical trial (n=78) was too imprecise to yield meaningful results. Two clinical trials are currently ongoing. No study measured long-term quality of life or cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS Existing data on the effects of vasopressors following traumatic injury are of very low quality according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. With emerging evidence of harm associated with aggressive fluid resuscitation and, in selected subgroups of patients, with permissive hypotension, the alternatives to vasopressor therapy are limited. Observational data showing that vasopressors are part of usual care would provide a strong justification for high-quality clinical trials of early vasopressor use during trauma resuscitation.

India contributes to one-third of the global TB burden. However, no studies have been carried out in the Telangana (Hyderabad) population using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Therefore, the current study evaluated the role of RT-PCR as a rapid and non-invasive test to diagnose TB by testing for pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB). Materials and methods This hospital-based study examined 1670 samples (900 EPTB; 770 PTB) comprising tissue (n = 537), peritoneal fluid (n = 420), sputum (n = 166), bronchial fluid (n = 126), cerebrospinal fluid (n = 145), ascetic fluid (n = 76), sputum pus (n = 78), urine (n = 79), and bronchoalveolar fluid (n = 43) samples. DNA from samples was separated using specific isolation kits and subjected to RT-PCR. Results In this study, we enrolled 1670 subjects and categorized 54.4% as females and 45.6% as males. The collected samples were categorized as 48.5% of fluid samples, followed by tissue (32.2%), sputum (9.9%), urine (4.7%), and pus-swab (4.6%). RT-PCR analysis revealed that 4.7% patients were positive for Mtb. Our results revealed that 61% of the affected patients were male and 39% were female. Among the specimen types, tissue samples gave the highest proportion of positive results (36.3%). Conclusion The results showed that RT-PCR should be implemented and given top priority in TB diagnosis to save time and facilitate a definitive diagnosis. Tissue samples are highly recommended to screen the Mtb through the technique RTPCR.

METHODS Pseudo-monoenergetic CT images were obtained using the dual-energy mode on the Siemens Somatom Definition AS scanner. A range of PMR combinations (70-130 keV) were used with and without iMAR. A Virtual Water™ phantom was used for quantitative assessment of error in the presence of high density materials: titanium, alloys 330 and 600. The absolute values of CT number differences (AD) and normalised standard deviations (NSD) were calculated for different phantom positions. Image quality was assessed using an anthropomorphic pelvic phantom with an embedded hip prosthesis. Image quality was scored blindly by five observers. RESULTS AD and NSD values revealed differences in CT number errors between tested sets. AD and NSD were reduced in the vicinity of metal for images with iMAR (p < 0.001 for AD/NSD). For ROIs away from metal, with and without iMAR, 70 keV PMR and pCT AD values were lower than for the other reconstructions (p = 0.039). Similarly, iMAR NSD values measured away from metal were lower for 130 keV and 70 keV PMR (p = 0.002). Image quality scores were higher for 70 keV and 130 keV PMR with iMAR (p = 0.034). CONCLUSION The use of 70 keV PMR with iMAR allows for significant metal artefact reduction and low CT number errors observed in the vicinity of dense materials. It is therefore an attractive alternative to high keV imaging when imaging patients with metallic implants, especially in the context of radiotherapy planning.","Pawałowski, Bartosz; Panek, Rafał; Szweda, Hubert; Piotrowski, Tomasz",Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics,255,1

The characteristics, symptoms, blood glucose patterns, comorbidities, and treatments of TBIR all vary and are not defined. In this study, we described a case of TBIR that developed 6 months after DPP-4 inhibitor administration and immediately after the patient caught a cold. Treatment using prednisolone and insulin-like growth factor-1 was effective. We also conducted an observational survey-based case series study in a Japanese cohort comprising 21 cases. The average age of onset of TBIR was 62.3 ± 14.8 (17-84) years, and 61.9% of subjects were male. The majority of patients (90.4%) were 50 years old and over. During the study period, there was a high percentage (85.7%) of episodes of hypoglycemia, which was the trigger for diagnosis in more than 50% of cases. Glycemic patterns included 7 cases of hyperglycemia (33.3%), 10 cases of hypoglycemia (47.6%), and 4 cases of both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia (19.1%). In the hypoglycemic group, 90.0% of patients were male. Furthermore, 71.4% of cases were antinuclear antibody positive, and 81.0% of cases were complicated with autoimmune disease. Systemic lupus erythematosus (38.1%) and Sjögren's syndrome (23.8%) were relatively common as coexisting autoimmune diseases. Treatment was based on prednisolone use, which was used in 88.9% of patients. On the other hand, the effect of IGF-1 was limited. Overall, the prognosis of TBIR was good.","Hirota, Yusuke; Suwanai, Hirotsugu; Yamauchi, Toshimasa; Kadowaki, Takashi",Journal of diabetes research,255,1

The cost implications of dabigatran for this population are unknown but are important given the significant clinical implications. METHODS Hospitalized events, procedures, and study and non-study medications were documented. We applied Canadian unit costs to healthcare resources consumed for all patients in the trial, and calculated the average cost per patient in Canadian dollars for the duration of the study (median follow-up of 16 months). A sensitivity analysis was performed using only Canadian patients, and subgroup analyses were also conducted. RESULTS The total study cost for the dabigatran group was $9985 per patient, compared with $10,082 for placebo, a difference of - $97 (95% confidence interval [CI] - $2128 to $3672). Savings arising from fewer clinical events and procedures in the dabigatran 110 mg twice-daily group were enough to offset the cost of the study drug. In Canadian patients, the difference was $250 (95% CI -$2848 to $4840). Both differences were considered cost neutral. Dabigatran 110 mg twice daily was cost saving or cost neutral in many subgroups that were considered. CONCLUSION Dabigatran 110 mg twice daily was cost neutral for patients in the MANAGE trial. Our cost findings support the use of dabigatran 110 mg twice daily in patients with MINS.

Since the occurrence and development of cancer usually accompany with inflammation, and tumor signaling shares many components with inflammation signaling, the agents with anti-tumor activity are likely to possess anti-inflammation potential. Thus, the current study aims to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory activity along with the underlying mechanism of IDET in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed macrophages. By using Griess method and ELISA, we found that in both bone marrow derived macrophages and alveolar macrophage cell line, IDET, at relatively low concentrations (0.75, 1.5 and 3 μM), could inhibit LPS-induced expression of various pro-inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide (NO) generated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and IL-1β. Meanwhile, in activated MH-S cells, the inhibitory action of IDET on mRNA expression levels of these cytokines was also detected using qPCR. Mechanistically, the effects of IDET on two key inflammatory signalings, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) pathways, were determined in LPS-activated MH-S cells by reporter gene along with western blot assays. On the one hand, IDET suppressed NF-κB signaling via down-regulating phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB)-α and the subsequent p65 translocation. On the other hand, IDET dampened AP-1 signaling through attenuating phosphorylation of both c-jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2) and extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Our study indicates that IDET might be a promising constituent from the anti-inflammatory herb Elephantopus scaber Linn. in mitigating inflammatory conditions, especially respiratory inflammation.","Han, Yixin; Li, Ximeng; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Gao, Yuan; Qi, Ruijuan; Cai, Runlan; Qi, Yun",International immunopharmacology,255,24

One patient with fistula at the V3 segment had rapid fistula recurrence one week after covered stent treatment. The possible causes of failed treatment in this patient are discussed. The currently available treatment modalities for VV-AVF are also summarized after a literature review. At the end of this article, we propose a new concept of anatomically based approach for endovascular treatment of VV-AVF. Fistula in the V1-2 segments of vertebral artery could be treated safely and effectively by covered stent with the benefit of preserving VA patency. Embolization with variable embolizers should be considered first for fistula in the V3 segment because of the tortuous course and flexibility of the VA in this segment.","Yeh, Chih-Hua; Chen, Yao-Liang; Wu, Yi-Ming; Huang, Yu-Chieh; Wong, Ho-Fai","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",255,5

People experiencing disability due to Covid-19 express specific rehabilitation needs that deserve a systematic evidence-based approach. OBJECTIVES To provide the rehabilitation community with updates on the latest scientific literature on rehabilitation needs due to Covid-19. The first rapid ""living"" review will present the results of a systematic search performed up to March 31st, 2020. METHODS A systematic search on PubMed, Pedro and Google Scholar was performed using the search terms: ""Covid-19"", ""Coronavirus"", ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"", ""rehabilitation"", ""physical therapy modalities"", ""exercise"", ""occupational therapy"", and ""late complications"". Papers published up to March 31st, 2020, in English, were included. RESULTS Out of the 2758 articles retrieved, 9 were included in the present review. Four of them are ""calls for action"", 3 provide recommendations about rehabilitation interventions in the acute phase, 2 address the needs of people quarantined at home or with restricted mobility due to the lockdown, and 1 provides a Core Outcome Set to be used in clinical trials to test the efficacy of health strategies in managing Covid-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS All selected papers were based on previous literature and not on the current Covid-19 pandemic. Main messages included: 1) early rehabilitation should be granted to inpatients with Covid-19; 2) people with restricted mobility due to quarantine or lockdown should receive exercise programs to reduce the risk of frailty, sarcopenia, cognitive decline and depression; 3) telerehabilitation may represent the first option for people at home. Further updates are warranted in order to characterize the emerging disability in Covid-19 survivors and the adverse effects on the health of chronically disabled people.","Ceravolo, Maria G; De Sire, Alessandro; Andrenelli, Elisa; Negrini, Francesco; Negrini, Stefano",European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine,255,17

METHODS A retrospective, observational study encompassing all patients admitted with a diagnosis of HF over two 12-month periods before (2012/2013), and after (2015/2016) IHFS establishment. RESULTS Total admissions for HF increased by 40% (385 vs 540), with a greater number admitted to the cardiology ward (231 vs 121). After IHFS implementation, patients were more likely to see a cardiologist (35.1% vs 43.7%, p=0.009), undergo echocardiography (70.1% vs 81.5%, p<0.001), be initiated on all three disease modifying HF medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA)) in the heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) group (42% vs 99%, p<0.001) and receive specialist HF input (81.6% vs 85.4%, p=0.2). Both 30-day post-discharge mortality and HF related readmissions were significantly lower in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (8.9% vs 3.1%, p=0.032, 58% reduction, p=0.043 respectively) with no-significant reductions in all other HF groups. In-patient mortality was similar. Length of stay in Cardiology wards increased from 8.4 to 12.7 days (p<0.001). CONCLUSION Establishment of an IHFS within a DGH with limited resources and only a modest service re-design has resulted in significantly improved provision of specialist in-patient care, use of HFrEF medications, early heart failure nurse follow-up, and is associated with a reduction in early mortality, particularly in the HFpEF cohort, and HF related readmissions.","Hawley, Alasdair; He, Jingzhou; Crabtree, Alice; Iacovides, Stelios; Keeling, Phil",Open heart,255,31

This study examines the clinical implications of altering gas composition by measuring the spark gap distance as a marker of breakdown voltage and use of the ESU on a biologic model, both in room air and carbon dioxide. Paschen's Law predicted a 35% decrease in gap distance in carbon dioxide, while testing revealed an average drop of 37-47% as compared to air. However, surgical model testing revealed no perceivable clinical difference. Electrosurgery can be performed in carbon dioxide environments, although surgeons should be aware of potentially altered ESU performance.","Culp, William C; Kimbrough, Bradly A; Luna, Sarah; Maguddayao, Aris J; Eidson, Jack L; Paolino, David V",Journal of medical engineering & technology,255,1

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Elective surgeries during the pandemic was limited acutely. Access to surgical care was restored in a recovery phase but backlogs and societal shifts are hypothesized to impact surgical access. METHODS Adults with electronic health record orders for procedures (""procedure requests""), from March 16 to August 25, 2019 and March 16 to August 25, 2020, were included. Logistic regression was performed for requested procedures that were not scheduled. Linear regression was performed for wait time from request to scheduled or completed procedure. RESULTS The number of patients with procedure requests decreased 20.8%, from 26,789 in 2019 to 21,162 in 2020. Patients aged 36-50 and >65 years, those speaking non-English languages, those with Medicare or no insurance, and those living > 100 miles away had disproportionately larger decreases. Requested procedures had significantly increased adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of not being scheduled for patients with primary languages other than English, Spanish, or Cantonese (aOR 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-2.28); unpartnered marital status (aOR 1.21, 95% CI 1.07-1.37); uninsured or self-pay (aOR 2.03, 95% CI 1.53-2.70). Significantly longer wait times were seen for patients aged 36-65 years; with Medi-Cal insurance; from ZIP codes with lower incomes; and from ZIP codes > 100 miles away. CONCLUSIONS Patient access to elective surgeries decreased during the pandemic recovery phase with disparities based on patient age, language, marital status, insurance, socioeconomic status, and distance from care.

According to the latest report (18-February-2020), it has infected more than 72,000 people globally and led to deaths of more than 1,016 people in China. Methods: The 2019 novel coronavirus proteome was aligned to a curated database of viral immunogenic peptides. The immunogenicity of detected peptides and their binding potential to HLA alleles was predicted by immunogenicity predictive models and NetMHCpan 4.0. Results: We report in silico identification of a comprehensive list of immunogenic peptides that can be used as potential targets for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) vaccine development. First, we found 28 nCoV peptides identical to Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS CoV) that have previously been characterized immunogenic by T cell assays. Second, we identified 48 nCoV peptides having a high degree of similarity with immunogenic peptides deposited in The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Lastly, we conducted a de novo search of 2019-nCoV 9-mer peptides that i) bind to common HLA alleles in Chinese and European population and ii) have T Cell Receptor (TCR) recognition potential by positional weight matrices and a recently developed immunogenicity algorithm, iPred, and identified in total 63 peptides with a high immunogenicity potential.

The hourly variations of accumulated NoL and NO2 and surface ozone are also compared for 24 hours before and after the lightning activity for four days of study during the years of 2009-2013. The results show that there is a positive correlation between PM10 concentration and lightning flash number, obtained from observational data of WWLLN. Moreover, the comparison of NoL and surface pollutant concentration indicates a clear positive contribution from CG lightning in NO2 and ozone production. In days with a considerable number of lightning occurrences, the comparison of the hourly average of NO2 and O3 concentrations with the lightning flash number reveals that NO2 decreases, and O3 increases due to the significant increases of lightning strikes.","Gharaylou, Maryam; Mahmoudian, Alireza; Bidokhti, AbbasAli A; Dadras, Pegah Sadr",Environmental monitoring and assessment,255,1

Blood samples were obtained and submitted for evaluation of acid-base balance, performance of a CBC, and measurement of electrolyte and total protein concentrations. RESULTS Severe metabolic acidosis (extracellular base excess more negative than -10 mmol/L) was associated with abnormal mental status, delayed or absent suckle reflex, abnormal posture or gait, enophthalmos, and cold oral mucosal membranes. Clinical signs associated with severe metabolic acidosis were arranged into a grid to create a diagnostic diagram. Sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic diagram for the prediction of severe metabolic acidosis were 88% and 79%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Use of the diagnostic diagram may aid differentiation between severe and nonsevere acidosis patterns as determined on the basis of clinical signs.","Bellino, Claudio; Arnaudo, Fabrizio; Biolatti, Cristina; Borrelli, Antonio; Gianella, Paola; Maurella, Cristiana; Zabaldano, Giuseppe; Cagnasso, Aurelio; D'Angelo, Antonio",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,255,28

Contour, symmetry, and skin texture of the nose, along with adequate nasal airway patency, should be preserved. The Z-advancement flap is a novel reconstruction technique designed for optimal cosmesis and function. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the aesthetic and functional outcomes of Z-advancement flap nasal reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-nine consecutive patients with defects 1 cm or less in diameter on the lateral nasal tip or medial ala underwent Z-advancement flap repair. Patients completed a survey assessing cosmesis and airway patency. Three physicians evaluated standardized photographs on visibility of scar lines, erythema and telangiectasia, and contour and symmetry of the ala and nostril opening. RESULTS Twenty-eight (96%) patients completed survey questionnaires. All patients were satisfied with the look and feel of their reconstructed nose. Twenty-four (86%) saw no visible scar or abnormality. Postoperative photographs were available for review in 19 (66%) patients. In 95% to 96% of physician ratings, scars were invisible or visible only on close inspection, and alar symmetry was unchanged or only slightly altered. In 88%, nostril opening symmetry was unchanged or slightly altered. CONCLUSIONS The Z-advancement flap preserves aesthetic subunits of the nose to produce excellent cosmesis and patient satisfaction for defects of the lateral nasal tip or medial ala 1 cm or less in diameter.","Eberlin, Kyle R; Nguyen, Bichchau; Karia, Pritesh S; Carter, Joi B; Liang, Christine A; Schmults, Chrysalyne D",Dermatologic surgery : official publication for American Society for Dermatologic Surgery [et al.],255,1

The platforms are associations of research centres, university research groups and funding bodies in Member States that are dedicated to specialised areas of research in radiation protection, such as health risks (MELODI), radioecology (ALLIANCE), radiological emergencies (NERIS), dosimetry (EURADOS), medical use of radiation (EURAMED) and societal aspects (SHARE). Recently these platforms established an umbrella organisation MEENAS, to endorse further integration and joint activities in research, education and training, and infrastructures. A milestone in this process of integration and priority setting was achieved in 2020 when the first edition of the Joint Roadmap for Radiation Protection Research was finalised. In this paper we describe the various roles for research and development in the radiation protection context, ranging from basic scientific knowledge underpinning the system of protection to research supporting the development and application of international standards and research and development activities needed to ensure safety in radiation practices and in potential exposure scenarios. We describe the process of how the joint roadmap has been developed and how it could be implemented. Finally, we address the need to anticipate potential future exposure scenarios and to systematically consider the impact of emerging technologies and global challenges in the context of radiation protection. The joint roadmap is a living document that needs to be regularly updated to cover both current and potential exposures of humans and the environment.","Impens, Nathalie R E N; Salomaa, Sisko",Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,255,16

One patient population that may suffer from poor outcomes during the pandemic are those with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Many practices are performing some form of teleophthalmology services for their patients, and guidance is needed on how to maintain continuity of care amongst patients with AMD using teleophthalmology. METHODS A literature search was conducted, ending 1 August 2020, to identify AMD outcomes and telecare management strategies that could be used during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS 237 total articles were retrieved, 56 of which were included for analysis. Four American Academy of Ophthalmology and Center for Disease Control web resources were also included. DISCUSSION Risk-stratification models have been developed that let providers readily screen existing patients for their future risk of neovascular AMD (nAMD). When used with at-home monitoring devices to detect nAMD, providers may be able to determine who should be contacted via teleophthalmology for screening. Telemedicine triage can be used for new complaints of vision loss to determine who should be referred to a retinal specialist for management of suspected nAMD. To increase access and provider flexibility, smartphone fundus photography images sent to a centralized teleophthalmology service can aid in the detection of nAMD. Considerations should also be made for COVID-19 transmission, and teleophthalmology can be used to screen patients for the presence of COVID-19 prior to in-person office visits. Teleophthalmology has additional utility in connecting with nursing home, rural, and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients in the post-pandemic period.","Mintz, Joel; Labiste, Chase; DiCaro, Michael V; McElroy, Evan; Alizadeh, Reza; Xu, Kunyong",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,255,12

Meta-analyses were performed on baseline and subsequent time-points.- From the 6067 articles retrieved, 49 studies were included (61 % low quality). Meta-analyses showed short-term HRQoL differences between esophageal cancer patients receiving definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT), neoadjuvant chemo(radio)therapy (nC(R)T), or surgery alone (p < 0.001), with better HRQoL with nC(R)T and surgery compared to dCRT. Over the course of 12 months, no HRQoL difference was identified between treatments in esophageal cancer (p = 0.633). Esophagectomy, but not gastrectomy, resulted in a clinically relevant decline in HRQoL. No long-term HRQoL differences were identified between curative treatments in esophageal and gastric cancer.

Multiplex serological testing can be particularly useful because it can simultaneously analyze antibodies to multiple antigens that optimizes pathogen coverage, and controls for variability in the organism and the individual host response. Here we describe a SARS-CoV-2 IgG 3-plex fluorescent microsphere-based assay that can detect both IgM and IgG antibodies to three major SARS-CoV-2 antigens-the spike (S) protein, spike angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor-binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (Nc). The assay was shown to have comparable performance to a SARS-CoV-2 reference assay for IgG in serum obtained at ≥21 days from symptom onset but had higher sensitivity with samples collected at ≤5 days from symptom onset. Further, using soluble ACE2 in a neutralization assay format, inhibition of antibody binding was demonstrated for S and RBD.","Angeloni, Stephen; Cameron, Andrew; Pecora, Nicole D; Dunbar, Sherry",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,255,33

We found that Gorlin NES cells formed tumors in mouse cerebellum mimicking human medulloblastoma. Retransplantation of tumor-isolated NES (tNES) cells resulted in accelerated tumor formation, cells with reduced growth factor dependency, enhanced neurosphere formation in vitro, and increased sensitivity to Vismodegib. Using our model, we identified LGALS1 to be a GLI target gene that is up-regulated in both Gorlin tNES cells and SHH-subgroup of medulloblastoma patients. Taken together, we demonstrate that NES cells derived from Gorlin patients can be used as a resource to model medulloblastoma initiation and progression and to identify putative targets.","Susanto, Evelyn; Marin Navarro, Ana; Zhou, Leilei; Sundström, Anders; van Bree, Niek; Stantic, Marina; Moslem, Mohsen; Tailor, Jignesh; Rietdijk, Jonne; Zubillaga, Veronica; Hübner, Jens-Martin; Weishaupt, Holger; Wolfsberger, Johanna; Alafuzoff, Irina; Nordgren, Ann; Magnaldo, Thierry; Siesjö, Peter; Johnsen, John Inge; Kool, Marcel; Tammimies, Kristiina; Darabi, Anna; Swartling, Fredrik J; Falk, Anna; Wilhelm, Margareta",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,255,1

Primary cortical neurons, obtained from E15 mice pups, seeded either on PDL or Matrigel coated culture ware were investigated by DIC/bright field and fluorescence/confocal microscopy for their morphology, 2D and 3D structure, and distribution patterns. Patch clamp, western blot and RT-PCR studies were performed to investigate neuronal firing thresholds and sodium channel subtypes Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 expression. Cortical neurons cultured on PDL coating possessed a 2D structure composed of a few number of branched and tortuous neurites that contacted with each other in one to one manner, however neurons on Matrigel coating showed a more complicated dimensional network that depicted tight, linear axonal bundles forming a 3D interacted neuron-astrocyte construction. This difference in growth patterns also showed a significant alteration in neuronal firing threshold which was recorded between 80120pA on PDL and 2160pA on Matrigel. Neurons grown up on Matrigel showed increased levels of sodium channel protein expression of Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 compared to neurons on PDL. These results have demonstrated that a 3D interacted neuron-astrocyte construction on Matrigel enhances the development of Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 in vitro and decreases neuronal firing threshold by 40 times compared to conventional PDL, resembling in vivo neuronal networks and hence would be a better in vitro model of adult neurons.","Karahuseyinoglu, Sercin; Sekerdag, Emine; Aria, Mohammad Mohammadi; Cetin Tas, Yagmur; Nizamoglu, Sedat; Solaroglu, Ihsan; Gürsoy-Özdemir, Yasemin",Journal of neurochemistry,255,7

This paper describes the foremost methods and outcomes of airway management in patients in the emergency department who required intubation for status asthmaticus. METHODS We analyzed all intubations with a primary indication of asthma over a 3-y period (January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018) using the National Emergency Airway Registry (NEAR), a 25-center, prospective, observational registry of emergency department intubations. We report the incidence of intubations for asthma, methods and medications used, devices used, peri-intubation adverse events, and intubation success and failures using univariate descriptive statistics and cluster-adjusted incidence with 95% CI. RESULTS A total of 19,071 encounters were recorded during the study period, with 14,517 patients intubated for medical indications. Of those, 173 (1.2%, 95% CI 0.9-1.6) were intubated for asthma. The first-attempt success rate was 90.8% (95% CI 81.9-95.5), and overall intubation success was 100%. Compared to the medical registry as a whole, patients with asthma were more likely to undergo rapid-sequence intubation (96.5% [95% CI 92.9-98.3] vs 80.8% [95% CI 75.1-82.5]), preoxygenation with bi-level positive airway pressure (BPAP) (62.9% [95% CI 49.6-74.6] vs 13.5% (95% CI 10.4-16.9]), and induction with ketamine (51.8% [95% CI 30.6-71.4] vs 11.6% [95% CI 7.6-16.8]). The adverse event rate in the patients with asthma was 12.14% (95% CI 8.1-17.9) compared to 11.93% (95% CI 9.79-14.12) in the medical registry. CONCLUSIONS Status asthmaticus accounts for about 1% of emergent medical intubations. The majority of patients are intubated using rapid-sequence intubation after preoxygenation with BPAP and induction with ketamine, with the latter 2 practices being much more common for emergent intubations for status asthmaticus than for other medical indications.","Godwin, Haley T; Fix, Megan L; Baker, Olesya; Madsen, Troy; Walls, Ron M; Brown, Calvin A",Respiratory care,255,7

Leiomyomas of the oral cavity are unusual. Oral leiomyomas are uncommon due to the paucity of the smooth muscle in the mouth (except in blood vessels) and thus the involvement of jaw bones is extremely rare. Leiomyomas have been classified as solid angiomyoma, angioleiomyoma (vascular leiomyoma), and epithelioid variants. Angioleiomyomas are benign mesenchymal tumors derived from smooth muscle, which rarely occur in the oral cavity. Malignant transformation probably does not occur but careful histopathologic examination is still necessary to differentiate these benign lesions from their malignant counterparts due to different prognosis. Although uncommon in the maxilla and mandible, they should be included in the differential diagnosis of radiolucent lesions of jaw bones. An extensive search of literature was carried out on the Medline-PubMed and Google Scholar database using the keywords such as leiomyoma, angioleiomyoma, jaw bones, maxilla, mandible, intra-osseous to thoroughly search and collect all the reported cases of intraosseous leiomyoma (but our search was not limited to these terms only). To the best of our knowledge, only 23 cases of intraosseous leiomyomas have been reported so far in the jaw bones, among which only 8 belonged to angioleiomyomas.

Here, we investigated the expression of PD-1 and CXCR3 on CD8+CD28- T cells in association with the IFN-γ levels in patients with RA. A total of 42 RA patients, including 10 newly-diagnosed (ND) and 32 relapsed (RL) cases and also 20 healthy donors were enrolled. Phenotypic characterization of CD8 + T cells derived from peripheral blood (PB) and synovial fluid (SF) was performed by flow cytometry. The plasma and SF IFN-γ levels were also assessed by ELISA. The frequency of CD8+CD28- T cells showed no significant differences between patients and controls while its higher levels were observed in PB, versus SF of RL patients. Relapsed patients also showed higher CXCR3 and especially PD-1 expression on their CD8+CD28- T cells. The IFN-γ concentration was elevated in SF of ND patients while its plasma level was significantly lower in RL subgroup than controls. Although PD-1 could induce immune suppression in effector T cells, it is upregulated during inflammation and its overexpression on CD8+CD28- T cells within inflammatory synovium is associated with severity of disease in our cohort of RA patients.","Ajama, Faezeh; Aghaei, Mehrdad; Mohammadi, Saeed; Samiei, Hadise; Behnampour, Nasser; Memarian, Ali",Immunology letters,255,30

However, the pathological mechanisms underlying this manifestation are unknown. In this article, we present two cases of collapsing glomerulopathy (CG) associated with acute tubular necrosis during the course of COVID-19, and review the literature for similar reports. In our two cases, as in the 14 cases reported so far, the patients were of African ancestry. The 14 patients assessed had an APOL1 high-risk genotype. At the end of the reported period, two patients had died and five patients were still requiring dialysis. The 16 cases detailed in the present report strongly argue in favour of a causal link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the occurrence of CG in patients homozygous for APOL1 high-risk genotype for which the term COVID-associated nephropathy (COVIDAN) can be put forward.","Izzedine, Hassan; Brocheriou, Isabelle; Arzouk, Nadia; Seilhean, Danielle; Couvert, Philippe; Cluzel, Philippe; Pha, Micheline; Le Monnier, Ophelie; Varnous, Shadia; Andreelli, Fabrizio; Amoura, Zahir; Mathian, Alexis",Internal medicine journal,255,17

Studies have shown that recurrent seizures may increase the concentration of reactive oxygen species, which can lead to oxidative stress and neuronal damage. These seizures result in substantial deleterious effects on an individual's health. Organic and conventional grape juices are rich in polyphenols, compounds with important antioxidant activity. However, these juices could have differences in their polyphenol content. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective and anticonvulsant effects of organic and conventional grape juice treatments in Wistar rats against pentylenetetrazole (a convulsant drug)-induced damage. In addition, we evaluated potential behavioral changes in rats treated with the juices and the polyphenolic profile of those samples. Animals (n=16 in each group) received treatment with saline, organic or conventional grape juice for 17 days. On the eighteenth day, behavioral changes were evaluated by an open field test. Afterwards, half of the rats from each group received pentylenetetrazole and were observed for 30 min to evaluate possible seizure characteristics. The animals were subsequently killed by decapitation and their hippocampus, cerebellum and cerebral cortex tissues were isolated. The results of this study showed that neither organic nor conventional grape juice altered the behavior parameters, and no statistical differences were observed in the seizure characteristics of the groups. Nevertheless, both juice types were able to protect from lipid and protein oxidative damage, decrease nitric oxide content and increase enzymatic (superoxide dismutase and catalase) and non-enzymatic (sulfhydryl protein) antioxidant defenses in brain tissues following pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures. In general, organic juice showed superior results in each test, probably due to its higher polyphenol content relative to conventional juice. These results indicate that grape juices can provide further insight into natural neuroprotective compounds and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for epileptic patients.","Rodrigues, Adriana Dalpicolli; Scheffel, Thamiris Becker; Scola, Gustavo; Santos, Maitê Telles Dos; Fank, Bruna; de Freitas, Suzana Cesa Vieira; Dani, Caroline; Vanderlinde, Regina; Henriques, João Antonio Pegas; Coitinho, Adriana Simon; Salvador, Mirian",Neurochemistry international,255,16

In a study in Beirut in 2003, before banning the leaded gasoline, 79% of the participants showed blood lead levels (BLLs) higher than 5 µg/dL. The prevalence of lead exposure in Lebanon after the ban on leaded gasoline has not been studied. This study assessed the BLL in Lebanese children aged 1-6 years. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted in three hospitals in Beirut. The children's BLLs were tested, and their caregiver completed a questionnaire to identify subgroups at risk of exposure. Participants were provided with a WHO brochure highlighting the risks of lead. RESULTS Ninety children with a mean age of 3.5±1.5 years were enrolled in the study and had a mean BLL of 1.1±0.7 µg/dL, with all values being below 5.0 µg/dL, showing a marked decrease in BLL compared with the mean BLL before the ban on leaded gasoline in 2002. Having a father or a mother with a college degree (p=0.01 and p=0.035, respectively) and having a monthly household income greater than $1000 (p=0.021) were associated with significantly lower BLL. Having more rooms at home and residing close to construction sites were associated with a significantly lower BLL (p=0.001 and p=0.026, respectively). Residing in a house aged >40 years and receiving traditional remedies were associated with a significantly higher BLL (p=0.009 and p<0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSION BLLs have declined among Lebanese children and this could be attributed to multiple factors including the ban of leaded gasoline. It would be beneficial to conduct a larger study with a nationally representative sample to better characterise the BLL.","El Zahran, Tharwat; Mostafa, Hala; Hamade, Hani; Al Hariri, Moustafa; Saab, Aed; Tamim, Hani; Tohme, Rasha; Al Hamod, Dany A; Sinno, Durriyah; Sawaya, Rasha Dorothy; Kazzi, Ziad",Archives of disease in childhood,255,26

In rural areas, population-wide implementation of Stroke Units is challenging. Therefore, the TeleMedical Project for integrative Stroke Care (TEMPiS) was established in 2003 as a TeleStroke Unit network to overcome this barrier in Southeast Bavaria/Germany. Evaluation of its implementation between 2003 and 2005 had revealed improved process quality and clinical outcomes compared with matched hospitals without TeleStroke Units. Data on sustainability of these effects are lacking. METHODS Effects on the stroke care of the local population were analyzed by using data from official hospital reports. Prospective registries from 2003 to 2012 describe processes and outcomes of consecutive patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack treated in TEMPiS hospitals. Quality indicators assess diagnostics, treatment, and outcome. Rates and timeliness of intravenous thrombolysis as well as data on teleconsultations and secondary interhospital transfers were reported over time. RESULTS Within the covered area, network implementation increased the number of patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack treated in hospitals with (Tele-)Stroke Units substantially from 19% to 78%. Between February 2003 and December 2012, 54 804 strokes and transient ischemic attacks were treated in 15 regional hospitals, and 31 864 teleconsultations were performed. Intravenous thrombolysis was applied 3331 stroke cases with proportions increasing from 2.6% to 15.5% of all patients with ischemic stroke. Median onset-to-treatment times decreased from 150 (interquartile range, 127-163) to 120 minutes (interquartile range, 90-160) and door-to-needle times from 80 (interquartile range, 68-101) to 40 minutes (interquartile range, 29-59).

The aim is to minimize health care service disruption as well as reducing COVID-19 exposure. However, one of the major operational concerns is cancellations and rescheduling (C/Rs). C/Rs may create additional burden and cost to the patient, provider, and the health system. Our aim is to understand the reasons for C/Rs of the telehealth session after the scheduled start time. Materials and Methods: We reviewed electronic health records (EHRs) to identify the C/R reasons for behavioral health and speech language pathology departments. Documented C/Rs in the medical charts were identified from EHR by using a keyword-based and Natural Language Processing (NLP)-supported EHR search engine. From the search results, we randomly selected 200 notes and conducted a thematic analysis. Results: We identified four themes explaining C/R reasons. Most frequent theme was ""technicality"" (47, 36%), followed by ""engagement"" (34, 25%), ""scheduling"" (31, 24%), and ""unspecified"" (20, 15%). The findings showed that technical reasons are the leading cause of C/Rs, constituting 36% of the cases (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29-43%). Notably, ""engagement"" constituted a sizeable 25% (95% CI: 19-31%) of C/Rs, as a result of the inability to engage a patient to complete the telehealth session. Conclusions: The study shows that engagement is one of the new challenges to the pediatric telehealth visits. Future studies of new engagement models are needed for the success of telehealth. Our findings will help fill the literature gaps and may help with enhancing the digital experience for both caregivers and providers, reducing wasted time and resources due to preventable C/Rs, improving clinical operation efficiency, and treatment adherence.","Sezgin, Emre; Huang, Yungui; Lin, Deborah; Ramtekkar, Ujjwal; Pauline, Lindsey; Lin, Simon",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,255,12

Notably, all of these outbreaks have been linked to suspected zoonotic transmission of bat-borne viruses. Bats-the only flying mammal-display several additional features that are unique among mammals, such as a long lifespan relative to body size, a low rate of tumorigenesis and an exceptional ability to host viruses without presenting clinical disease. Here we discuss the mechanisms that underpin the host defence system and immune tolerance of bats, and their ramifications for human health and disease. Recent studies suggest that 64 million years of adaptive evolution have shaped the host defence system of bats to balance defence and tolerance, which has resulted in a unique ability to act as an ideal reservoir host for viruses. Lessons from the effective host defence of bats would help us to better understand viral evolution and to better predict, prevent and control future viral spillovers. Studying the mechanisms of immune tolerance in bats could lead to new approaches to improving human health. We strongly believe that it is time to focus on bats in research for the benefit of both bats and humankind.","Irving, Aaron T; Ahn, Matae; Goh, Geraldine; Anderson, Danielle E; Wang, Lin-Fa",Nature,255,1

Human genetic information is identifiable and contains sensitive information, but genetic information security is only recently gaining attention. Genetic data is generated in an evolving and distributed cyber-physical system, with multiple subsystems that handle information and multiple partners that rely and influence the whole ecosystem. This paper characterizes a general genetic information system from the point of biological material collection through long-term data sharing, storage and application in the security context. While all biotechnology stakeholders and ecosystems are valuable assets to the bioeconomy, genetic information systems are particularly vulnerable with great potential for harm and misuse. The security of post-analysis phases of data dissemination and storage have been focused on by others, but the security of wet and dry laboratories is also challenging due to distributed devices and systems that are not designed nor implemented with security in mind. Consequently, industry standards and best operational practices threaten the security of genetic information systems. Extensive development of laboratory security will be required to realize the potential of this emerging field while protecting the bioeconomy and all of its stakeholders.","Schumacher, Garrett J; Sawaya, Sterling; Nelson, Demetrius; Hansen, Aaron J",Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,255,20

We present a base mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in India and its neighbor, Pakistan. The base model was rigorously analyzed and parameterized using cumulative COVID-19 mortality data from each of the two countries. The model was used to assess the population-level impact of the control and mitigation strategies implemented in the two countries (notably non-pharmaceutical interventions). Numerical simulations of the basic model indicate that, based on the current baseline levels of the control and mitigation strategies implemented, the pandemic trajectory in India is on a downward trend. This downward trend will be reversed, and India will be recording mild outbreaks, if the control and mitigation strategies are relaxed from their current levels. By early September 2021, our simulations suggest that India could record up to 460,000 cumulative deaths under baseline levels of the implemented control strategies, while Pakistan (where the pandemic is comparatively milder) could see over 24,000 cumulative deaths at current mitigation levels. The basic model was extended to assess the impact of back-and-forth mobility between the two countries. Simulations of the resulting metapopulation model show that the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan increases with increasing values of the average time residents of India spend in Pakistan, with daily mortality in Pakistan peaking in mid-August to mid-September of 2021. Under the respective baseline control scenarios, our simulations show that the back-and-forth mobility between India and Pakistan could delay the time-to-elimination of the COVID-19 pandemic in India and Pakistan to November 2022 and July 2022, respectively.","Brozak, Samantha J.; Pant, Binod; Safdar, Salman; Gumel, Abba B.",,255,10

So also is its impact on social entrepreneurs. One of the main questions being, what is the extent to which small businesses overcome the imminent economic recession amid the threat of COVID-19? Many small businesses have already closed operations due to the countrywide lockdown in India and the resultant cash flow constraints. The government has introduced loan guarantee schemes as a way of support, but it is not sufficient for operational expenses. This study examines the survival traits of positive deviance and social entrepreneurial roles that may be pertinent to women?s empowerment, concerning the challenges that have emerged from the pandemic.Methodology:Case study methodology was adopted, engaging Rosenblatt?s Transactional Theory to collect qualitative data, which are part of the narratives based on the experiences of a focus group within the social entrepreneurial venture, called Pipal Tree, while a descriptive approach was deployed to isolate and analyze the relevant survival traits, that is, leadership, multidimensional resourcefulness, altruism, innovation, norm-violation and labelling/stigmatization.Findings:The findings revealed that every trait?that is, leadership, multidimensional resourcefulness, altruism, innovation, norm-violation, and labelling/stigmatization?could potentially play an important role and contribute towards the sustainability of social entrepreneurs to empower women amidst the pandemic. The paper observed that ultimately this insight might be relevant to social entrepreneurs, managers and policymakers in developing effective survival strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic.Originality values:This is a conceptualization and empirically based study that engaged in primary data collection, analysis and interpretation supported with literature evidence. As well as insights on the literature and methodology development, its unique contributions also include conceptualizing the phenomenon and strategy development. Additionally, it promotes diversity and inclusivity, as well as highlighting inequality.Social implication/Practical values:This study can serve as a guide towards addressing social issues relating to global social entrepreneurship policy-making. As such, it would be a powerful tool for women empowerment, policymakers, not-for-profit organizations, civil society and social entrepreneurs in the post-COVID-19 global environment.Theoretical contributions:This study has added the literature to the existing theory relating to social deviance, social entrepreneurship and women empowerment, thereby advancing knowledge. Highlighting issues about how humanity responds to this strange new threat from the COVID-19 pandemic is critical to saving lives. The new knowledge gained will often equip social entrepreneurs to capture new ways of survival (innovative ways) in complex and new challenges to cope with post-COVID-19 socio-economic circumstances. These benefits gained may be beneficial not only in Jharkhand India but nationally as well as globally. The authors also made an addition to the definition of positive deviance.Practical contributions:The study contributes towards enabling social entrepreneurs to cope in uncertain situations, which is critical to survival most challenging or crises and not just in entrepreneurship?so in critical decision-making, problem-solving, diversity management, gender equity, human rights advancement through women empowerment, business setting and expansion, in helping weakness into strengths and ensuring a level playing ground and inclusivity. Women empowerment can be a positive strength in policy formulation and implementation processes.

Cardiology trainees in the UK are expected to demonstrate Level 3 competency (perform the procedure unsupervised and deal with complications) in pericardiocentesis in order to meet the curriculum requirements to achieve their Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT). Given the high risk of complications associated with pericardiocentesis, it is now increasingly performed by interventional cardiologists in specialist centres, resulting in fewer opportunities for trainees to observe and practice this procedure during their training. This has become more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic when normal clinical activities were largely put on hold, resulting in an increase in demand for simulation-based training and assessment of practical procedures. Methods Four cardiology trainees attended a series of two teaching sessions held 1 month apart which involved an immersive simulated scenario on the management of a patient with life-threatening cardiac tamponade. This included a period of teaching from a qualified trainer, followed by an observed assessment whereby trainees attended to a simulated patient and initiated relevant treatment, including successfully performing pericardiocentesis whilst interacting with colleagues and the patient. The procedure was performed using an 'Ultrasound Guided Pericardiocentesis Simulator' and a patient actor. Trainees were assessed using the Joint Royal Colleges Physician Training Board (JRCPTB) Directly Observed Procedures (DOPS) proforma for pericardiocentesis. The assessment comprised of 9 different domains graded (A-F), and a point score (1-6) was assigned according to their level of competency, generating an overall assessment score out of 54 points and mean score out of 6 points. Results Three out of the 4 trainees improved their mean assessment scores by an average of 22% in subsequent sessions (figure 1). Trainee 1 was already fully competent on initial assessment (initial mean score 6/6), demonstrated sustained competency throughout subsequent assessments and consequently fulfilled their training requirements for pericardiocentesis. Conclusion Immersive simulation is an effective, low-risk and high-fidelity method of training and assessment of pericardiocentesis for cardiology trainees. Although additional trainee data will be required to comprehensively validate it as an effective assessment tool for pericardiocentesis, during times where clinical experience is limited, immersive simulation can be an essential alternative training tool to allow trainees to meet requirements for their training and maintain clinical competencies.","Mbonye, K.

Specifically, few programs enable high-throughput peak assessment of liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) data acquired in either selected or multiple reaction monitoring (SRM and MRM) modes. Results We present here Bayesian Annotations for Targeted Lipidomics (BATL), a Gaussian naïve Bayes classifier for targeted lipidomics that annotates peak identities according to eight features related to retention time, intensity, and peak shape. Lipid identification is achieved by modelling distributions of these eight input features across biological conditions and maximizing the joint posterior probabilities of all peak identities at a given transition. When applied to sphingolipid and glycerophosphocholine SRM datasets, we demonstrate over 95% of all peaks are rapidly and correctly identified.

There is emerging evidence that memorized items are represented rhythmically on the specific phase of the theta-band (4–7 Hz) neural oscillation. However, it is still unknown how this process impacts the accessibility to the active memory storage. Here we show that simply memorizing sequential information causes theta-band fluctuation in our behaviour (i.e., reaction time, RT). We measured RTs to a visual probe that appeared at sequentially memorized locations after a random interval. Consequently, RTs to the probes fluctuated in the theta range as a function of the random interval, and the behavioural rhythmicity supported the hypothesis of the phase-dependent coding of sequential working memory. The current results demonstrate that our behaviour fluctuates unconsciously in the theta-range when recalling sequential memory, suggesting that accessibility to sequential working memory is rhythmic rather than stable, possibly reflecting theta-phase dependent coding.","Ideriha, Takuya; Ushiyama, Junichi",bioRxiv,255,1

However, that task becomes challenging due to the massive data that learning management systems store and categorise. With the COVID-19 pandemic still on-going, face-to-face learning settings have migrate into online and blended ones, meaning an increase of online students and teachers in need for a tailored and effective support to their needs. A novel unsupervised clustering technique based on the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) artificial neural network model is used in this research to analyse 1,709,189 records of online students enrolled from 2015 to 2019 at Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR), a fully online Higher Education institution. SOM performs a precise and diverse user clustering based on those records. Results highlight that specific clusters are linked to the intake average profile at the university, with a clear relation between user interaction and a higher performance. Further, results show that, out of a targeted desk research compared to the analysis in this paper, face-to-face and online settings are connected through the methodological approach beyond the technology-based environment, which presents a similar behaviour in both contexts.

The Regulation merely gives a framework for the coordination of national legislation, and member states can still decide if they want to set up screening mechanisms and to screen foreign direct investments. The pandemic has accelerated these processes, and more and more European Union member states enacted legislation relating to the screening of foreign direct investments in strategic branches of the economy. The Commission has also issued a Guidance at the end of March 2020, in which it warns about the risk that the Coronavirus related economic shock might have on strategic industries, especially on healthcare related industries. At the same time, recognizing the importance of foreign direct investments for the economy, it pointed out in the Guidance the necessity to find a balance between the need for foreign capital and the protection of European Union strategic industries using appropriate screening tools.","Vig, Zoltán",Pro Futuro,255,1

In the course of the pandemic, a large number of new fundamental and medical issues have been revealed regarding the relationship between viral infection and many common chronic non-infectious diseases, among which immune-mediated rheumatic diseases (IMRD) occupy an important position. It is now well known that SARS-CoV-2 infection is accompanied by a wide range of extrapulmonary clinical and laboratory disorders, some of which are characteristic of IMRD and other autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases in humans. The most severe consequence of alterations in regulation of the immunity in COVID-19 and IMRD is the so-called cytokine storm syndrome, which is defined as COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory syndrome in COVID-19, and as macrophage activation syndrome in IMRD. The COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory syndrome was used as a reason for drug repurposing and off-label use of a wide range of anti-inflammatory drugs, which have been specially developed for the treatment of IMRD over the past 20 years. Common immunopathological mechanisms and approaches to pharmacotherapy in COVID-19 and IMRD determined the unique place of rheumatology among medical specialties contributing to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The article provides the basic provisions of the International and National Association of Rheumatologists and the Association of Rheumatologists of Russia (ARR) recommendations for management of patients with IMRD during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nasonov, E.

Design: Exploratory analysis of the number of STI tests done, positive rates for those tests and of percentage of compliance to follow-up from March to December 2020 and its comparison with historical data at the University Health Services, UW-Madison. Sample: students STI tests during the analyzed period. Measurement: Observed (2020) vs Expected (2015-2019, average) number of STI tests, positive rate, compliance to follow-up testing for STIs. Results: There was a significant decrease in the number of tests done and increase of positive rate when compared to historical for total sample and per sex. There was a decrease in the percentage of follow-up for the entire sample and females and an increase for males. Conclusions: Considering the three outcomes assessed, we observe an impact in STI testing during the pandemic. In concordance with national data, our analysis shows significant declines in STI testing and follow-up during 2020 compared to previous years and an increase in positivity rate. The finding of higher positivity with lower number of tests is likely due to triaging patients, facilitating testing for those at highest risk of infection.","Marconi, A. M.; Falk-Hanson, E.

This search reveals the lowest mass-ratio planetary caustic to date in the microlensing event OGLE-2019-BLG-1053, for which the planetary signal had not been noticed before. The planetary system has a planet-host mass ratio of $q = (1.25 \pm 0.13) \times 10^{-5}$. A Bayesian analysis yields estimates of the mass of the host star, $M_{\rm host} = 0.61_{-0.24}^{+0.29}~M_\odot$, the mass of its planet, $M_{\rm planet} = 2.48_{-0.98}^{+1.19}~M_{\oplus}$, the projected planet-host separation, $a_\perp = 3.4_{-0.5}^{+0.5}$ au, and the lens distance of $D_{\rm L} = 6.8_{-0.9}^{+0.6}$ kpc. The discovery of this very low mass-ratio planet illustrates the utility of our method and opens a new window for a large and homogeneous sample to study the microlensing planet-host mass-ratio function down to $q \sim 10^{-5}$.","Zang, Weicheng; Hwang, Kyu-Ha; Udalski, Andrzej; Wang, Tianshu; Zhu, Wei; Sumi, Takahiro; Gould, Andrew; Mao, Shude; Zhang, Xiangyu; Albrow, Michael D.; Chung, Sun-Ju; Han, Cheongho; Jung, Youn Kil; Ryu, Yoon-Hyun; Shin, In-Gu; Shvartzvald, Yossi; Yee, Jennifer C.; Cha, Sang-Mok; Kim, Dong-Jin; Kim, Hyoun-Woo; Kim, Seung-Lee; Lee, Chung-Uk; Lee, Dong-Joo; Lee, Yongseok; Park, Byeong-Gon; Pogge, Richard W.; Mr'oz, Przemek; Skowron, Jan; Szyma'nski, MichalK.; Soszy'nski, Igor; Pietrukowicz, Pawel; Kozlowski, Szymon; Ulaczyk, Krzysztof; Rybicki, Krzysztof A.; Iwanek, Patryk; Wrona, Marcin; Gromadzki, Mariusz; Bond, Ian A.; Abe, Fumio; Barry, Richard; Bennett, David P.; Bhattacharya, Aparna; Donachie, Martin; Fujii, Hirosane; Fukui, Akihiko; Hirao, Yuki; Itow, Yoshitaka; Kirikawa, Rintaro; Kondo, Iona; Koshimoto, Naoki; Li, Man Cheung Alex; Matsubara, Yutaka; Muraki, Yasushi; Miyazaki, Shota; Olmschenk, Greg; Ranc, Cl'ement; Rattenbury, Nicholas J.; Satoh, Yuki; Shoji, Hikaru; Silva, Stela Ishitani; Suzuki, Daisuke; Tanaka, Yuzuru; Tristram, Paul J.; Yamawaki, Tsubasa; Yonehara, Atsunori",,255,1

Coronaviruses are present in our lives almost constantly. Currently, the world is struggling with a pandemic caused by the new SARS CoV-2 coronavirus, which is the etiological factor of COVID-19 disease. Objective: The aim of the study is to review scientific reports and systematize current knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and the COVID-19 disease it causes in the face of the ongoing pandemic. State of knowledge: The course of SARS-CoV-2 infection is similar to cases caused by coronaviruses of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). Symptoms vary from mild to viral pneumonia, including fever, difficulty breathing, bilateral infiltrative pneumonia, and multi-organ failure in the most severe cases. COVID-19 disease also leads to complications, such as pulmonary fibrosis, neurological disorders, an increased risk of heart attack, thrombosis, and liver dysfunction. The review presents information about the taxonomy, structure, pathomechanism, clinical symptoms, complications, number of cases, diagnostics, and treatment of COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread quickly around the world, causing a rapidly increasing number of infections and deaths among patients. There is currently no effective vaccine or targeted treatment. The only way to prevent the spread of the virus remains quarantine, the isolation of sick people, and the use of a sanitary regime.","Zeidler, Agnieszka Karpiński Tomasz M.",Medycyna Środowiskowa = Environmental Medicine,255,32

In addition to the lack of efficient management through unpredicted events and occasions. Drawing on extended resources based view and resilience theory, this paper attempts to shed the light on the mediating role of resilience between supply chain integration and organizational performance represented in quality, cost and delivery performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. 224 questionnaires were collected and analyzed through process macro technique proposed by Andrew Hayes to test the mediating role of resilience. The results indicated that resilience can significantly mediate the relationship between supply chain integration and quality, cost and delivery performance. Therefore, this paper contributes to both extended resources based view and resilience theory. As it empathize on how organizations can acquire a unique bundle of resources through integration, which will allow them to maintain a desirable level of performance during market disruption through building resilience.

However, whether more active engagement in artistic and creative activities is associated with lower rates of depression remains unknown. We aimed to test whether active arts engagement was associated with concurrent and subsequent depression Methods: Using longitudinal data from 19,134 participants aged over 50 in the Health and Retirement Study, arts engagement was measured every four years, and depression every two years, between 2008 and 2016. A score of three or more on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale indicated depression. We fitted population-averaged panel data models using generalized estimating equations with a logit link. Results: Engaging in artistic and creative activities, such as clubs, hobbies, and baking/cooking was associated with reduced depression, independent of confounders. Concurrently, spending time on hobbies (monthly OR=0.80, 95% CI=0.72-0.88; weekly OR=0.81, 95% CI=0.73-0.89) and clubs (monthly OR=0.85, 95% CI=0.77-0.94; weekly OR=0.78, 95% CI=0.69-0.88) was associated with lower odds of depression versus not engaging. Longitudinally, the odds of depression two years later were reduced amongst people engaging in weekly baking/cooking (OR=0.85, 95% CI=0.75-0.95), hobbies (OR=0.81, 95% CI=0.71-0.92), and clubs (OR=0.82, 95% CI=0.71-0.94). Writing, reading, sewing, and attending non-religious organizations were not consistently associated with depression. Discussion: Active engagement in artistic and creative activities is associated with reduced odds of depression. We should consider how older adults can be supported to actively engage in the arts as a health-promoting behavior.","Bone, J. K.; Bu, F.; Fluharty, M. E.; Paul, E.; Sonke, J.

However, various factors may reduce TH levels, potentially impacting the onset and development of pregnancy. Such cases of thyroid dysfunction are divided into overt (clinical) hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, or isolated hypothyroxinemia, depending on the severity of deficiency. The reported incidence of overt hypothyroidism in pregnancy is 0.3-1.9%, while that of subclinical hypothyroidism is 1.5-5% and that of isolated hypothyroxinemia ranges between 1.3%-25.4%. On a global level, the most common factor for hypothyroidism is iodine deficiency, but in regions where iodine sufficiency is the norm, the most cause is autoimmune thyroiditis or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Early diagnosis and treatment of low TH levels can play a significant role in lowering the risk of negative outcomes such as recurring miscarriage, gestational hypertension, premature birth, and adverse fetal outcomes. However, there is no agreement on TH reference levels during pregnancy to be used to diagnose thyroid dysfunction, nor is there agreement on universal screening of pregnant women for thyroid function in the first trimester, so specific studies for different populations are needed. In extremely stressful events, as is the case during the COVID-19 pandemic, thyroid function may be altered early in pregnancy, so pregnant women in these situations merit extra monitoring of their thyroid function. As managed hypothyroidism is not a risk factor for more negative outcomes in patients with COVID-19, no extra precautions or measures need to be taken.

To study this, the formation of episodic memories was evaluated by free recall, recognition, and episode order tasks for an aversive and neutral content. The results indicated that aversive episodic memory is impaired both in the free recall task and in the recognition task. Even the beneficial effect that emotional memory usually has for the episodic order was undermined as there were no differences between the neutral and aversive condition. The present work adds to the evidence that indicates that the level of activation does not modify memory processes in a linear way, which also depends on the type of evocation that people are asked and the characteristics of the content to be encoded.","Sofía, León Candela; Matías, Bonilla; Benítez Facundo, Urreta; Ignacio, Brusco Luis; Jingyi, Wang; Cecilia, Forcato",bioRxiv,255,1

Past studies have indicated that mentoring programs can positively impact student soft skills development and employability. While undergraduate mentoring programs have mushroomed, research on undergraduate mentoring has not kept pace. This study used a mixed methods approach to examine the effectiveness of a public university’s initiative in mentoring new undergraduates. Using the College Student Mentoring Scale (CSMS), this study found that the university’s undergraduate mentoring initiative is moderately effective. The CSMS assessed four mentoring dimensions, namely academic subject knowledge support, degree and career support, psychological and emotional support as well as role modelling. The results of this study highlighted the mentoring functions that are considered as least effective so that informed and targeted efforts can be undertaken to enhance university freshman mentoring. Findings from this study suggest that a new dimension namely mentor-mentee compatibility, competencies and expectations could be added to the College Student Mentoring Scale (CSMS) to enhance concept operationalization. A limitation of this study is that it is based on mentees’ perspectives only. Future research could include the perspectives of mentors as well. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.","Chong, Y.; Thi, L.

Two days after an elective and uneventful intubation he developed severe and worsening surgical emphysema affecting his face, neck and both upper limbs. Ventilation was difficult to be achieved. Based on a negative chest X-ray, a CT scan of the chest was organized which showed extensive pneumomediastinum with no obvious cause. Therefore, urgent bronchoscopy was performed which showed a glassy lesion/laceration measuring 2 cm × 2 cm at the level of mid-trachea but no other signs of penetration through the airways were noted. Since events appeared 2 days after intubation, this was perceived as secondary to trauma during intubation on an inflammatory process background from RA and COVID-19 in the airways. The endotracheal tube was progressed beyond the site of laceration and bilateral pectoral fasciotomies were performed with negative suction vacuum dressings, which was successful in decreasing the surgical emphysema and achieving decreased ventilation requirements. Despite multi-organ support the patient continued to deteriorate and unfortunately passed away a week following admission.

What is not yet clear is how the current changes will affect the IT job market and the career behavior of information technology (IT) professionals. Regardless of what these changes will look like, retaining qualified IT professionals will remain a crucial challenge for many companies that want to master the digitization accelerated by COVID-19. This challenge raises the following major question-how will companies retain their IT staff, even in times of crisis? We therefore examine the construct of workplace social support by using a survey of 212 IT professionals to investigate the extent to which workplace social support can be used as a suitable instrument for reducing turnover intention during crises. We discover that workplace social support reduces the perceived negative influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on professional life and increases perceived job security during the crisis. Furthermore, IT professionals with a high level of workplace social support suffer less often from negative emotions such as anger or fear. This positive influence subsequently reduces IT professionals' turnover intention. Our study provides insights into the positive effects of workplace social support during crises and informs companies about how they can successfully guide their IT employees through a crisis. © 2021 ACM.","Prommegger, B.; Krcmar, H.","58th Computers and People Research Conference, SIGMIS-CPR 2021",255,1

The beginning of each semester brings about a wave of invitations to visit each professor in their office, at the allotted time for the section of their class. Recent developments such as the growing prevalence of texting and email, as well as specific events such as the Covid-19 pandemic have brought the norm away from these in person meetings between students and professors, to the detriment of the students' education. The SmArt WhiteBoard Replacement Interactive Device (SAWBRID) is an innovative solution composed of an interactive device with a Low-power screen that, through a user friendly mobile application, makes the facilitation of office hours and the student/professor interactions outside of the classroom far more flexible and simple. In whole, the project is centered around the individual professor, their schedule, and how that schedule is communicated. The SAWBRID sits in an accessible casing outside of the professor's office, relaying information about their schedule, available time slots to be scheduled through the mobile application, and personalized messages. The device is self-updating whenever a change is detected in the professor's schedule, or when they decide to update their personalized message. The student can access a professor's schedule through the mobile application and schedule an appointment, which will place their initials in the selected time slot on both the mobile application and the SAWBRID. The professor has a different interface to interact with their SAWBRID from the mobile application giving them more control over their schedule, the personalized messages they want to display and other features. We use security services such as confidentiality and authentication throughout the system to protect user credentials, user data, and to ensure the privacy of the users.

Persistent and/or recurrent COVID-19 has not yet been demonstrated in this population. We identified patients with B-cell lymphomas as having a particularly high risk for persistent SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Subsequent analysis of patients with lymphoid malignancies and COVID-19 identified discrete risk factors for severity of primary infection as compared to disease chronicity. Active therapy and diminished T-cell counts were key drivers of acute mortality in lymphoma patients with COVID-19 infection. Conversely, B-cell depleting therapy was the primary driver of re-hospitalization for COVID-19. In patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 positivity, we observed high levels of viral entropy consistent with intrahost viral evolution, particularly in patients with impaired CD8+ T-cell immunity. These results suggest that persistent COVID-19 infection is likely to remain a risk in patients with impaired adaptive immunity and that additional therapeutic strategies are needed to enable viral clearance in this high-risk population. Statement of Significance We establish persistent symptomatic COVID-19 infection as a novel clinical syndrome in patients with lymphoid malignancies and identify B-cell depletion as the key immunologic driver of persistent infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate ongoing intrahost viral evolution in patients with persistent COVID-19 infection, particularly in patients with impaired CD8+ T-cell immunity.","Lee, C. Y.; Shah, M.

Enteral nutrition influences intestinal gene regulation and the susceptibility for inflammatory bowel disorders, such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). In modern neonatology it is observed that lactase activity increases during intestinal maturation, but formula-fed infants exhibit lower activity levels than milk-fed infants. Since human breast milk has a high microRNA content in comparison to other body fluids, it is controversially discussed whether they could influence gene regulation in term and preterm neonates and thus might vertically transmit developmental relevant signals. Design: Following their discovery we utilized mammalian taxon-specific milk microRNA as tracers in human and porcine neonates, followed by functional studies in primary human fetal intestinal epithelial cells (HIEC-6). Results: Mammals have in common a significant number of milk microRNAs yet exhibit taxon-specific microRNA fingerprints. We traced intact bovine-specific microRNAs from formula-nutrition in human preterm stool and 9 days after the onset of enteral feeding in intestinal cells of preterm piglets. Few hours after introducing enteral feeding in preterm piglets with supplemented reporter microRNAs (cel-miR-39-5p/-3p), we observed enrichment of the xenobiotic cel-miR in blood serum and in Ago2-immunocomplexes from intestinal biopsies. This points to a transmissibility of milk microRNA signals. We performed Adenovirus type 5-based microRNA-gene transfer into HIEC-6 and examined predicted bovine milk microRNA targets on the protein and transcriptome levels. Conclusion: Results suggest that milk microRNAs could influence gene expression in intestinal epithelia of neonates under special conditions in vitro.","Weil, P. P.; Reincke, S.; Hirsch, C.

The purpose of this study was to examine its two-factor affect model in the realm of stress, depression, and fatigue in working adults. METHODS Affect, stress, depression, and fatigue were assessed with validated questionnaires in a sample of 228 adults (49.6% male; mean = 41.4 +/- 9 years) from the working population. RESULTS The GMS PA and NA scales were internally consistent (Cronbach's alpha = .94 and alpha = .93, respectively), and correlated in the expected direction with their corresponding mood scales from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Factor analyses of the 40 mood terms comprising the GMS and PANAS yielded one common PA-dimension, but two NA-dimensions reflecting emotional exhaustion (GMS) and anxious apprehension (PANAS) as different components of the stress process. A relatively high mean NA score of the GMS suggested that these working adults perceived terms that refer to malaise/deactivation as being relevant to describe their negative affective status. The GSM-NA scale was related to stress, depression and fatigue while the GMS-PA scale was positively associated with quality of life. LIMITATIONS This study is based on a cross-sectional design.

Perioperative outcomes-complications/reoperations and patient-preferred technique-were collected with mean clinical follow up of 4.8 and 2.0 years for mTKA and rTKA, respectively. RESULTS mTKA were performed significantly (p<0.01) more quickly than rTKA, including shorter tourniquet time (56 versus 73 minutes) and total operating room time (93 versus 116 minutes). rTKA patients length of stay (LOS) was significantly (p<0.01) decreased (1.8 days) compared to mTKA (2.3 days). For rTKA and mTKA, respectively, there was no difference in final range of motion (119 versus 122 degrees), Visual Analog Scale (1.6 versus 0.9), or Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Jr (85 versus 87). Twenty (56%) reported rTKA as the preferred technique over mTKA. CONCLUSION In same patient direct comparison, rTKA required longer operative time but improved LOS compared to mTKA. There was no difference in final outcomes with only slightly more patients preferring rTKA.","Pelkowski, Jessica N; Wilke, Benjamin K; Crowe, Matthew M; Sherman, Courtney E; Ortiguera, Cedric J; Ledford, Cameron K",Surgical technology international,255,1

In the past decade most developed and several developing countries have recommended influenza vaccination for those > 65 years of age. The World Health Organization (WHO) set a goal of 75% influenza vaccination coverage among the elderly by 2010, but it was not achieved. In 2011, the Technical Advisory Group at the Pan American Health Organization, Regional Office of WHO for the Americas, reiterated the influenza vaccine recommendation for older adults. Relatively little information has been compiled on the immunological aspect of aging or on reducing its impact, information particularly relevant for clinicians and gerontologist with firsthand experience confronting its effects. To fill this data gap, in 2012 the Americas Health Foundation (Washington, D.C., United States) and the nonprofit, Fighting Infectious Diseases in Emerging Countries (Miami, Florida, United States), convened a panel of Latin American clinicians and gerontologists with expertise in influenza to discuss key issues and develop a consensus statement. The major recommendations were to improve influenza surveillance throughout Latin America so that its impact can be quantified; and to conduct laboratory confirmation of influenza for all patients who have flu-like symptoms and are frail, immunosuppressed, have comorbidities, are respiratory compromised, or have been admitted to a hospital. The panel also noted that: since evidence for antivirals in the elderly is unclear, their use should be handled on a case-by-case basis; despite decreased immunological response, influenza vaccination in older adults is still crucial; indirect immunization strategies should be encouraged; and traditional infection control measures are essential in long-term care facilities.","Rüttimann, Ricardo W; Bonvehí, Pablo E; Vilar-Compte, Diana; Isturiz, Raúl E; Labarca, Jaime A; Vidal, Edison I",Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,255,5

For most other major human viral pathogens, the absence of an efficacious prophylactic vaccine is not for lack of effort. To identify the key parameters of biologic feasibility that determine ""certainty-of-success"" for developing prophylactic vaccines for major human viral pathogens, basic characteristics of viruses, such as primary genomic structure, route of transmission, and durability of viral infection were reviewed. These basic characteristics of viruses simply do not associate with successful vaccine development, so one must look elsewhere for characteristics predictive of successful vaccine development. Herein existing data are put forth in a way that demonstrates the impact of the combined effect of incubation period and broadly protective, relative immunogenicity on the ""certainty-of-success"" of developing effective vaccines for thirty viral pathogens. Both incubation period and broadly protective, relative immunogenicity appear to have accounted for much of the past successes in vaccine development, and may be useful in predicting where near term successes are most apt to occur.","Kaslow, David C",Human vaccines,255,19

In this study, we labeled de novo-synthesized viral RNA in situ with bromouridine triphosphate (BrUTP) in Huh7 cells expressing an HCV subgenomic replicon. By immunofluorescence staining using an anti-BrUTP antibody and confocal microscopy, we showed that the newly synthesized HCV RNA was localized to distinct speckle-like structures, which also contain all of the HCV nonstructural (NS) proteins. These speckles are distinct from lipid droplets and are separated from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where some HCV NS proteins also reside. Membrane flotation analysis demonstrated that almost all of the NS5A and part of the NS5B proteins and all of the viral RNA were present in membrane fractions which are resistant to treatment with 1% NP-40 at 4 degrees C. They were cofractionated with caveolin-2, a lipid-raft-associated intracellular membrane protein, in the presence or absence of the detergent. In contrast, the ER-resident proteins were detergent soluble. These properties suggest that the membranes on which HCV RNA replication occurs are lipid rafts recruited from the intracellular membranes. The protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide and puromycin did not inhibit viral RNA synthesis, indicating that HCV RNA replication does not require continuous protein synthesis. We suggest that HCV RNA synthesis occurs on a lipid raft membrane structure.","Shi, Stephanie T; Lee, Ki-Jeong; Aizaki, Hideki; Hwang, Soon B; Lai, Michael M C",Journal of virology,255,16

Studies conducted in the general population have linked depressive symptoms with poor dietary patterns. The aim of this study was to characterise the dietary intake and analyse the dietary pattern using the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) in a sample of psychiatric patients in a multiethnic Asian nation. METHODS Participants were recruited from an outpatient clinic and an inpatient unit at the Institute of Mental Health in Singapore. Self-reported dietary habits of a sample of psychiatric patients (N=380) were analysed using DASH. To examine the variables associated with DASH scores, a linear regression was conducted with the full sample and sociodemographic variables. RESULTS Persons with depressive disorders had a mean DASH score of 21.3 (±4.2), while persons with psychotic disorders had a mean DASH score of 21.2 (±4.9). Respondents who were older (B=1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-2.96, P<0.001), female (B=1.09, 95% CI 0.07-2.11, P=0.04) and economically inactive (B=1.98, 95% CI 0.006-3.96, P=0.049) were more likely to report a higher diet quality compared with their respective counterparts, while smokers (B= -1.39, 95% CI -2.45 to -0.34, P=0.009) tended to report a lower diet quality compared with their non-smoking counterparts. CONCLUSION Dietary patterns of persons with mental disorders were characterised. A host of sociodemographic factors, and not diagnosis of mental disorders, influenced the dietary quality of people with depressive and psychotic disorders. Clinicians treating psychiatric patients need to be aware of the nuanced reasons behind poor dietary choices and provide targeted psychoeducation to specific subgroups within the patient population.","Subramaniam, Mythily; Lau, Jue Hua; Abdin, Edimansyah; Vaingankar, Janhavi Ajit; Tan, James Junda; Zhang, Yunjue; Chang, Sherilyn; Shahwan, Shazana; Shafie, Saleha; Sambasivam, Rajeswari; Chong, Siow Ann","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",255,16

In the rescue kennel there was no difference in seroprevalence of the virus between dogs less than or more than four months of age. In the breeding colony, subclinical seroconversion occurred between six and 10 weeks of age. The virus was isolated from faecal samples from 45 of 100 dogs in the rescue kennel; it was isolated from 73 per cent of the dogs with diarrhoea and from 43 per cent of those which did not have diarrhoea. In field cases of acute, mainly haemorrhagic diarrhoea in pet dogs, eight of 32 were positive for canine coronavirus. No canine coronavirus was isolated from either clinically healthy pet dogs in a boarding kennel or from non-diarrhoeic pet dogs examined at the University of Liverpool Small Animal Hospital.

Fusion of coronaviruses with the host cell is mediated by the envelope spike protein. Two regions within the spike protein of SARS-CoV have been identified, showing a high degree of sequence conservation with the other CoV, which are characterized by the presence of heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2). By using synthetic and recombinant peptides corresponding to the HR1 and HR2 regions, we were able to characterize the fusion-active complex formed by this novel CoV by CD, native PAGE, proteolysis protection analysis, and size-exclusion chromatography. HR1 and HR2 of SARS-CoV associate into an antiparallel six-helix bundle, with structural features typical of the other known class I fusion proteins. We have also mapped the specific boundaries of the region, within the longer HR1 domain, making contact with the shorter HR2 domain. Notably, the inner HR1 coiled coil is a stable alpha-helical domain even in the absence of interaction with the HR2 region. Inhibitors binding to HR regions of fusion proteins have been shown to be efficacious against many viruses, notably HIV. Our results may help in the design of anti-SARS therapeutics.","Ingallinella, Paolo; Bianchi, Elisabetta; Finotto, Marco; Cantoni, Giovanna; Eckert, Debra M; Supekar, Vinit M; Bruckmann, Chiara; Carfi, Andrea; Pessi, Antonello",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,255,19

The scale consists of 42 items and permits the calculation of the scores of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-21, the BDI 13, the Melancholia Subscale, the Asthenia Subscale, the Anxiety Subscale and the Mania Subscale METHODS 29 depressed patients 30.48 +/- 9.83 years old, and 120 normal controls 27.45 +/- 10.85 years old entered the study. In 20 of them (8 patients and 12 controls) the instrument was re-applied 1-2 days later. Translation and Back Translation was made. Clinical Diagnosis was reached by consensus of two examiners with the use of the SCAN v.2.0 and the IPDE. CES-D and ZDRS were used for cross-validation purposes. The Statistical Analysis included ANOVA, the Spearman Correlation Coefficient, Principal Components Analysis and the calculation of Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS The optimal cut-off points were: BDI-21: 14/15, BDI-13: 7/8, Melancholia: 8/9, Asthenia: 9/10, Anxiety: 10/11. Chronbach's alpha ranged between 0.86 and 0.92 for individual scales. Only the Mania subscale had very low alpha (0.12). The test-retest reliability was excellent for all scales with Spearman's Rho between 0.79 and 0.91. CONCLUSIONS The Greek translation of the SRSDA and the scales that consist it are both reliable and valid and are suitable for clinical and research use with satisfactory properties. Their properties are close to those reported in the international literature. However one should always have in mind the limitations inherent in the use of self-report scales.","Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N; Iacovides, Apostolos; Kleanthous, Soula; Samolis, Stavros; Gougoulias, Kyriakos; St Kaprinis, George; Bech, Per",BMC psychiatry,255,1

We obtained demographics, body mass index, diabetes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) history, smoking status, steroid use, number of prior repairs, defect size, mesh size, number of anchors, and recurrence and infection at follow-up. We performed Kaplan-Meier analysis using a composite of recurrence or infection. Three of eight (interquartile range, 37.5%) patients were male. Median age and body mass index were 47.5 years (31.0, 54.7) and 32.2 (29.0, 36.0), respectively. Three patients had prior repairs, one each with two, three, and five prior attempts at fixation. One of eight patients (12.5%) had a history of MRSA infection. One of eight patients (12.5%) had a history of intermittent steroid use for sarcoidosis. Defect size was 90 cm2 (62.2, 165) and mesh size was 155 cm2 (150, 232) with four anchors (4, 5.5). Procedural complications included 2/10 (20%) with recurrence and 1/10 (10%) with postoperative MRSA infection. Follow-up was 12 months (3.0, 25.0). Mean freedom from recurrence and mesh infection (Kaplan-Meier) was 43.5 months (95%confidence interval = 24.2, 62.8). In conclusion, our series is one of the largest in the literature involving the suture anchor technique. Despite a high-risk patient population due to trauma, obesity, and prior smoking and MRSA history, we achieved an acceptable recurrence rate.

Therefore agents for passive immunization, such as VZV-specific immunoglobulin preparations (VZIG) derived from convalescent plasma, are crucial in the prophylaxis of VZV infection. This study describes the isolation of human VZV-neutralizing recombinant antibodies. A human single-chain variable fragment (scFv) phage display library was generated from RNA extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes of a convalescent varicella patient. Specific phage antibodies were selected against VZV-infected human fibroblasts, and eight unique clones were further expressed as soluble scFv in Escherichia coli. They all showed binding characteristics to varicella antigens with affinities in the K(D) range 0.1-0.2 muM. Two of the scFv antibodies, VZV4 and VZV5, showed dose-dependent in vitro neutralization of VZV. VZV39 also showed a neutralizing effect as scFv, an effect that was increased 4000-fold by conversion into IgG and was further increased by the addition of complement. This is possibly the first time that monovalent scFv antibodies have been shown to neutralize VZV in vitro. This finding will have an impact on the production of new prophylactic antibodies, as such antibody fragments can be cost-effectively produced in E. coli. The antibodies isolated bind both complement-dependent and -independent epitopes for neutralization, thus they may prove useful tools for the study of VZV virulence mechanisms.","Kausmally, L; Waalen, K; Løbersli, I; Hvattum, E; Berntsen, G; Michaelsen, T E; Brekke, O H",The Journal of general virology,255,29

In response to infection, numerous cytokines/chemokines are secreted by resident cells of the CNS and inflammatory leukocytes that participate in both host defense and disease. Among these are the ELR-positive chemokines that are able to signal through CXC chemokine receptors including CXCR2. Early following JHMV infection, ELR-positive chemokines contribute to host defense by attracting CXCR2-expressing cells including polymorphonuclear cells to the CNS that aid in host defense through increasing the permeability the blood-brain-barrier (BBB).

The prevalences found during the period 2000-2003 are compared with those reported for 1981-1984 and 1990-1993. It is shown that some infections were eliminated from laboratory animal colonies (e.g. K-virus and polyomavirus) by taking preventative measures whereas other infections such as mouse hepatitis virus and parvoviruses remained at a high rate. Further decreases in prevalence rates in the last 10 years were found for infections such as pneumonia virus of mice, reovirus type 3, Sendai virus, sialodacryoadenitis/rat coronavirus and Mycoplasma pulmonis. The introduction of new detection methods showed that mouse parvovirus and rat parvovirus, both members of the Parvoviridae family, remain a major threat to laboratory mice and rats. Guinea pig cytomegalovirus and para-influenza virus appeared to be the most prevalent agents among laboratory guinea pigs. The importance of a standardized, up-to-date screening programme is discussed.","Schoondermark-van de Ven, E M E; Philipse-Bergmann, I M A; van der Logt, J T M",Laboratory animals,255,27

STUDY DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PsycINFO (search dates 1966 to January 2002), and the Cochrane database on depression, anxiety and neurosis. We also searched the second Guide to Clinical Preventive Services, the 1993 Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Clinical Practice Guideline on Depression, and recent systematic reviews. Hand-checking of bibliographies and extensive peer review were also used to identify potential articles. OUTCOMES MEASURED A predefined search strategy targeted only studies of adults aged 65 years or older in primary care or community settings, including long-term care. Articles were included in this review if they reported original data and tested depression screening instruments against a criterion standard, yielding sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS Eighteen articles met criteria and are included in this review, representing 9 different screening instruments. The most commonly evaluated were the Geriatric Depression Scale (30- and 15-item versions), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and the SelfCARE(D). Differences in the performance of these 3 instruments were minimal; sensitivities ranged from 74% to 100% and specificities ranged from 53% to 98%. CONCLUSIONS Accurate and feasible screening instruments are available for detecting late-life depression in primary care. More research is needed to determine the accuracy of depression screening instruments for demented individuals, and for those with subthreshold depressive disorders.","Watson, Lea C; Pignone, Michael P",The Journal of family practice,255,15

METHOD One hundred and thirty eight patients were treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, a combination of ribavirin and low dose corticosteroid, and then intravenous high dose methylprednisolone according to responses. Sustained response to treatment was defined as (1) defervescence for > or =4 consecutive days, (2) resolution of lung consolidation by >25%, and (3) oxygen independence by the fourth day without fever. Patients with defervescence who achieved either criterion 2 or 3 were classified as partial responders. Patients who fell short of criteria 2 and 3 were non-responders. RESULTS Laboratory confirmation of SARS coronavirus infection was established in 132 (95.7%). None responded to antibiotics but 25 (18.1%) responded to ribavirin + low dose corticosteroid. Methylprednisolone was used in 107 patients, of whom 95 (88.8%) responded favourably. Evidence of haemolytic anaemia was observed in 49 (36%). A high level of C-reactive protein at presentation was the only independent predictor for use of methylprednisolone (odds ratio 2.18 per 10 mg/dl increase, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 4.25, p = 0.02). Thirty seven patients (26.8%) required admission to the intensive care unit and 21 (15.2%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. There were 15 deaths (mortality rate 10.9%), most with significant co-morbidities, whereas 122 (88.4%) had been discharged home 4 months after the outbreak onset. CONCLUSION The use of high dose pulse methylprednisolone during the clinical course of a SARS outbreak was associated with clinical improvement, but randomised controlled trials are needed to ascertain its efficacy in this condition.","Sung, J J Y; Wu, A; Joynt, G M; Yuen, K Y; Lee, N; Chan, P K S; Cockram, C S; Ahuja, A T; Yu, L M; Wong, V W; Hui, D S C",Thorax,255,1

Recently our research showed that some proteases facilitated SCoV's direct entry from the cell surface, resulting in a more efficient infection than the previously known infection via endosomal entry. To compare the inhibitory effect of the sHRP in each pathway, we selected two sHRPs, which showed a strong inhibitory effect on the interaction of two heptad repeats in a rapid and virus-free in vitro assay system. We found that they efficiently inhibited SCoV infection of the protease-mediated cell surface pathway but had little effect on the endosomal pathway. This finding suggests that sHRPs may effectively prevent infection in the lungs, where SCoV infection could be enhanced by proteases produced in this organ. This is the first observation that HRP exhibits different effects on virus that takes the endosomal pathway and virus that enters directly from the cell surface.","Ujike, Makoto; Nishikawa, Hiroki; Otaka, Akira; Yamamoto, Naoki; Yamamoto, Norio; Matsuoka, Masao; Kodama, Eiichi; Fujii, Nobutaka; Taguchi, Fumihiro",Journal of virology,255,16

If intervention is warranted, and open surgery is prohibitive, endovascular revascularization may be performed. The use of stents places the patient at additional risk due to their thrombogenic potential. The intent of this study was to compare outcomes following endovascular approaches (angioplasty alone vs. stent) in the setting of acute stroke. METHODS We extracted a population from the National Inpatient Sample (2012) and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2003-2011) composed of patients with carotid artery stenosis with infarction that were admitted nonelectively and received endovascular revascularization. Patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy or thrombolysis were excluded. Categorical variables were compared between treatment groups with Chi-squared tests. Binary logistic regression was performed to evaluate mortality and iatrogenic stroke while controlling for age, case severity, and comorbidity burden. RESULTS About 6,333 admissions met our criteria. A majority were treated via stenting (89%, n = 5,608). The angioplasty-alone group had significantly higher mortality (9.0% vs. 3.8%, p < 0.001) and iatrogenic stroke rate (3.9% vs. 1.9%, p < 0.001) than the stent group. The adjusted odds ratios of mortality and iatrogenic stroke for patients treated with angioplasty alone were 1.953 (p < 0.001) and 1.451 (p = 0.105), respectively, in comparison to patients treated with carotid stenting. CONCLUSION Multivariate analysis found the risk of mortality to be elevated following angioplasty alone. This may represent selection bias, but it also may indicate that symptomatic patients with stroke suffer from severe stenosis and unstable plaques that would benefit from stent placement. These results would caution angioplasty alone as an arm of a future randomized trial involving this severely burdened patient population requiring urgent intervention.","Villwock, Mark R; Padalino, David J; Deshaies, Eric M",Journal of vascular and interventional neurology,255,26

Recently, nitrogen- and carbon-doped TiO(2) substrates were shown to exhibit photocatalytic activities under visible-light illumination. Their antibacterial activity, however, remains to be quantified. In this study, we demonstrated that nitrogen-doped TiO(2) substrates have superior visible-light-induced bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli compared to pure TiO(2) and carbon-doped TiO(2) substrates. We also found that protein- and light-absorbing contaminants partially reduce the bactericidal activity of nitrogen-doped TiO(2) substrates due to their light-shielding effects. In the pathogen-killing experiment, a significantly higher proportion of all tested pathogens, including Shigella flexneri, Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Acinetobacter baumannii, were killed by visible-light-illuminated nitrogen-doped TiO(2) substrates than by pure TiO(2) substrates.

202631,202631,202631,Lightening the viral load to lessen covid-19 severity,16.302032,6.8916006,2020,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity is an important health behavior, due to its association with many physical and mental health conditions. During distressing events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a concern that physical activity levels may be negatively impacted. However, recent studies have shown inconsistent results. Additionally, there is a lack of studies in Australia on this topic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate changes in physical activity reported through the 10,000 Steps program and changes in engagement with the program during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data between January 1, 2018, and June 30, 2020, from registered members of the 10,000 Steps program, which included 3,548,825 days with step data, were used. The number of daily steps were logged manually by the members or synced automatically from their activity trackers connected to the program. Measures on program usage were the number of new registered members per day, the number of newly registered organizations per day, the number of steps logged per day, and the number of step entries per day. Key dates used for comparison were as follows: the first case with symptoms in Wuhan, China; the first case reported in Australia; the implementation of a 14-day ban for noncitizens arriving in Australia from China; the start of the lockdown in Australia; and the relaxing of restrictions by the Australian Government. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to test for significant differences in number of steps between subgroups, between engagement measures in 2019 versus 2020, and before and after an event. RESULTS: A decrease in steps was observed after the first case in Australia was reported (1.5%; P=.02) and after the start of the lockdown (3.4%; P<.001). At the time that the relaxing of restrictions started, the steps had already recovered from the lockdown. Additionally, the trends were consistent across genders and age groups. New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, and Victoria had the greatest step reductions, with decreases of 7.0% (P<.001), 6.2% (P=.02), and 4.7% (P<.001), respectively. During the lockdown, the use of the program increased steeply. On the peak day, there were more than 9000 step entries per day, with nearly 100 million steps logged per day; in addition, more than 450 new users and more than 15 new organizations registered per day, although the numbers decreased quickly when restrictions were relaxed. On average per day, there were about 55 new registered users (P<.001), 2 new organizations (P<.001), 25.6 million steps (P<.001), and 2672 log entries (P<.001) more in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has had negative effects on steps among Australians across age groups and genders. However, the effect was relatively small, with steps recovering quickly after the lockdown. There was a large increase in program usage during the pandemic, which might help minimize the health impact of the lockdown and confirms the important role of physical activity programs during times of distress and lockdowns.","To, Quyen G; Duncan, Mitch J; Van Itallie, Anetta; Vandelanotte, Corneel",J Med Internet Res,255,1

Where we look is influenced by bottom-up salience and top-down factors, like value. For reactive saccades in response to suddenly appearing stimuli, it has been shown that short-latency saccades are biased towards salience, and that top-down control increases with increasing latency. Here, we show, in a series of six experiments, that this transition towards top-down control is not determined by the time it takes to integrate value information into the saccade plan, but by the time it takes to inhibit suddenly appearing salient stimuli. Participants made consecutive saccades to three fixation crosses and a vertical bar consisting of a high-salient and a rewarded low-salient region. Endpoints on the bar were biased towards salience whenever it appeared or reappeared shortly before the last saccade was initiated. This was also true when the eye movement was already planned. When the location of the suddenly appearing salient region was predictable, saccades were aimed in the opposite direction to nullify this sudden onset effect. Successfully inhibiting salience, however, could only be achieved by previewing the target. These findings highlight the importance of inhibition for top-down eye-movement control.","Wolf, Christian; Lappe, Markus",Atten. percept. psychophys. (Print),255,1

Identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) T-cell epitopes and generation of peptide-human leukocyte antigen (peptide-HLA) tetramers facilitate direct ex vivo analyses of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and their T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires. We utilized a combination of peptide prediction and in vitro peptide stimulation to validate novel SARS-CoV-2 epitopes restricted by HLA-A*24:02, one of the most prominent HLA class I alleles, especially in Indigenous and Asian populations. Of the peptides screened, three spike-derived peptides generated CD8+ IFNÎ³+ responses above background, S1208-1216 (QYIKWPWYI), S448-456 (NYNYLYRLF) and S193-201 (VFKNIDGYF), with S1208 generating immunodominant CD8+ IFNÎ³+ responses. Using peptide-HLA-I tetramers, we performed direct ex vivo tetramer enrichment for HLA-A*24:02-restricted CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients and prepandemic controls. The precursor frequencies for HLA-A*24:02-restricted epitopes were within the range previously observed for other SARS-CoV-2 epitopes for both COVID-19 patients and prepandemic individuals. Naïve A24/SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells increased nearly 7.5-fold above the average precursor frequency during COVID-19, gaining effector and memory phenotypes. Ex vivo single-cell analyses of TCR&#945;ß repertoires found that the A24/S448 + CD8+ T-cell TCR&#945;ß repertoire was driven by a common TCRß chain motif, whereas the A24/S1208 + CD8+ TCR&#945;ß repertoire was diverse across COVID-19 patients. Our study provides an in depth characterization and important insights into SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses associated with a prominent HLA-A*24:02 allomorph.

This study aimed to investigate the association between the change in laboratory markers during the three days after pneumonia diagnosis and severe respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Data of 23 COVID-19 patients with pneumonia, admitted to the Kumamoto City Hospital between February and April 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 23 patients, eight patients received mechanical ventilation (MV) (MV group), and the remaining 15 comprised the non-MV group. The levels of hemoglobin (Hb) and albumin (Alb) decreased in the MV group during the three days after pneumonia diagnosis more than in the non-MV group (median Hb: 1.40 vs. -0.10 g/dL, P = 0.015; median Alb: 0.85 vs. -0.30 g/dL, P = 0.020). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the decrease in Hb was associated with receiving MV care (odds ratio: 0.313, 95% confidence interval: 0.100-0.976, P = 0.045). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed that the optimal cut-off value for the decrease in Hb level was -1.25 g/dL, with sensitivity and specificity values of 0.867 and 0.750, respectively.

Our aim therefore was to provide regular group reflective practice sessions with the aim of supporting junior doctor's mental wellbeing during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodJunior doctors within a critical care setting were offered two-weekly group reflective practice sessions focusing on ‘difficult or challenging cases and encounters.’ The sessions were offered to all junior and middle grade doctors within a critical care department in a small district general hospital. Consultants were also able to attend. The groups were facilitated by a consultant liaison psychiatrist and an accredited balint group leader. Critical care doctors were provided a feedback questionnaire assessing the impact of the sessions and the levels of stress and burnout. The themes emerging from the sessions were also explored.ResultA total of six reflective practice sessions were offered during a three-month period. A total of four reflective practice sessions were completed;two sessions were cancelled due to high workload on the department. Each session lasted approximately 50mins. On average a total of 3-4 junior doctors attended each session. The sessions were conducted face to face in a socially distanced manner and with all participants wearing face masks. The sessions were predominately attended by foundation doctors and SHOs. There was occasional attendance by middle grades and a consultant.The predominant themes that emerged included: guilt, prolonged suffering, desensitisation, support and exhaustion. Despite the challenges associated with the pandemic and lockdown, many of the doctors also acknowledged the benefit of being at work during both waves of the pandemic. There was a sense of collectiveness and group belonging. The group found it beneficial to be able to share their experiences and challenges faced;this was most striking amongst the very junior members of the team.Questionnaires were also provided to gain additional insight into the wellbeing of the critical care doctors. Worryingly the results highlighted a significant proportion of doctors were experiencing signs of burnout including fatigue (77%), lack of energy (54%), cynicism (31%), frustration and irritability (45%) and detachment (38%). Many of the issues highlighted were in response to the demand created by the pandemic and a lack of medical staffing wth 69% of doctors requesting regular feedback on staffing issues.ConclusionBurnout and low morale were already highlighted in a significant number of junior doctors prior to the pandemic. COVID-19 has identified a clear need for NHS employers and medical leaders to provide emotional and psychological support to staff. It is vital that we create an open environment where individuals can express their feelings openly without fear that they will be judged. Group reflective practice provides an avenue to build on collectiveness created during both waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. This pilot has demonstrated that if introduced as part of a wellbeing support package, junior doctors within a critical care setting are able to utilise the sessions in an effective and productive manner.","Ayeni, Itunuayo V.; Headon, Elizabeth",BJPsych Open,255,1

When presence is defined as being in the same place at the same time as another, suggesting that presence is essential to teaching-learning would certainly run counter to the recommended practice of social distancing. However, the question must be asked if it is essential for the teacher and learner to be in a particular place at the same moment for presence in teaching-learning to be known. Clarity of the meaning of presence in the teaching-learning endeavor is pursued through considering insights gained from the movie Patch Adams.

In Germany, the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown caused a substantial decrease in mobility, possibly affecting noise levels. The aim is to analyze the effects of the lockdown measures on noise levels in the densely populated Ruhr Area. We focus on the analysis of noise levels before and during lockdown considering different land use types, weekdays, and time of day. METHODS: We used data from 22 automatic sound devices of the SALVE (Acoustic Quality and Health in Urban Environments) project, running since 2019 in Bochum, Germany. We performed a pre/during lockdown comparison of A-weighted equivalent continuous sound pressure levels. The study period includes five weeks before and five weeks during the SARS-CoV-2 induced administrative lockdown measures starting on 16 March 2020. We stratified our data by land use category (LUC), days of the week, and daytime. RESULTS: We observed highest noise levels pre-lockdown in the 'main street' and 'commercial areas' (68.4 ± 6.7 dB resp. 61.0 ± 8.0 dB), while in 'urban forests' they were lowest (50.9 ± 6.6 dB). A distinct mean overall noise reduction of 5.1 dB took place, with noise reductions occurring in each LUC. However, the magnitude of noise levels differed considerably between the categories. Weakest noise reductions were found in the 'main street' (3.9 dB), and strongest in the 'urban forest', 'green space', and 'residential area' (5.9 dB each). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are in line with studies from European cities. Strikingly, all studies report noise reductions of about 5 dB. Aiming at a transformation to a health-promoting urban mobility can be a promising approach to mitigating health risks of noise in cities. Overall, the experiences currently generated by the pandemic offer data for best practices and policies for the development of healthy urban transportation-the effects of a lower traffic and more tranquil world were experienced firsthand by people during this time.","Hornberg, Jonas; Haselhoff, Timo; Lawrence, Bryce T; Fischer, Jonas L; Ahmed, Salman; Gruehn, Dietwald; Moebus, Susanne",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),255,21

Besides, the SARS-CoV-2 virus survives for several hours on different surfaces, where a new host can contract it with a delay. These passive modes of infection transmission remain an unexplored area for traditional mean-field epidemic models. Here, we design an agent-based model for simulations of infection transmission in an open system driven by the dynamics of social activity; the model takes into account the personal characteristics of individuals, as well as the survival time of the virus and its potential mutations. A growing bipartite graph embodies this biosocial process, consisting of active carriers (host) nodes that produce viral nodes during their infectious period. With its directed edges passing through viral nodes between two successive hosts, this graph contains complete information about the routes leading to each infected individual. We determine temporal fluctuations of the number of exposed and the number of infected individuals, the number of active carriers and active viruses at hourly resolution. The simulated processes underpin the latent infection transmissions, contributing significantly to the spread of the virus within a large time window. More precisely, being brought by social dynamics and exposed to the currently existing infection, an individual passes through the infectious state until eventually spontaneously recovers or otherwise is moves to a controlled hospital environment. Our results reveal complex feedback mechanisms that shape the dependence of the infection curve on the intensity of social dynamics and other sociobiological factors. In particular, the results show how the lockdown effectively reduces the spread of infection and how it increases again after the lockdown is removed. Furthermore, a reduced level of social activity but prolonged exposure of susceptible individuals have adverse effects. On the other hand, virus mutations that can gradually reduce the transmission rate by hopping to each new host along the infection path can significantly reduce the extent of the infection, but can not stop the spreading without additional social strategies. Our stochastic processes, based on graphs at the interface of biology and social dynamics, provide a new mathematical framework for simulations of various epidemic control strategies with high temporal resolution and virus traceability.","Tadic, Bosiljka; Melnik, Roderick",PLoS One,255,24

Here, we report an atomic model for full-length Nsp2 obtained by combining cryo-electron microscopy with deep learning-based structure prediction from AlphaFold2. The resulting structure reveals a highly-conserved zinc ion-binding site, suggesting a role for Nsp2 in RNA binding. Mapping emerging mutations from variants of SARS-CoV-2 on the resulting structure shows potential host-Nsp2 interaction regions. Using structural analysis together with affinity tagged purification mass spectrometry experiments, we identify Nsp2 mutants that are unable to interact with the actin-nucleation-promoting WASH protein complex or with GIGYF2, an inhibitor of translation initiation and modulator of ribosome-associated quality control. Our work suggests a potential role of Nsp2 in linking viral transcription within the viral replication-transcription complexes (RTC) to the translation initiation of the viral message. Collectively, the structure reported here, combined with mutant interaction mapping, provides a foundation for functional studies of this evolutionary conserved coronavirus protein and may assist future drug design.","Verba, K.; Gupta, M.; Azumaya, C.; Moritz, M.; Pourmal, S.; Diallo, A.; Merz, G.; Jang, G.; Bouhaddou, M.; Fossati, A.; Brilot, A.; Diwanji, D.; Hernandez, E.; Herrera, N.; Kratochvil, H.; Lam, V.; Li, F.; Li, Y.; Nguyen, H.; Nowotny, C.; Owens, T.; Peters, J.; Rizo, A.; Schulze-Gahmen, U.; Smith, A.; Young, I.; Yu, Z.; Asarnow, D.; Billesbølle, C.; Campbell, M.; Chen, J.; Chen, K.

Its use in the perioperative setting for patients with metastatic disease has not been well studied. We characterize perioperative plasma ctDNA and its association with progression-free survival (PFS) in patients undergoing surgery for peritoneal metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited 71 patients undergoing surgery for peritoneal metastases and evaluated their plasma with a targeted 73-gene ctDNA next-generation sequencing test before and after surgery. The association between perioperative ctDNA, as well as other patient factors, and PFS was evaluated by Cox regression. RESULTS: ctDNA was detectable in 28 patients (39.4%) preoperatively and in 37 patients (52.1%) postoperatively. Patients with high ctDNA [maximum somatic variant allele fraction (MSVAF) > 0.25%] had worse PFS than those with low MSVAF (< 0.25%) in both the pre- and postoperative settings (median 4.8 vs. 19.3 months, p < 0.001, and 9.2 vs.15.0 months, p = 0.049, respectively; log-rank test). On multivariate analysis, high-grade histology [hazard ratio (HR) 3.42, p = 0.001], incomplete resection (HR 2.35, p = 0.010), and high preoperative MSVAF (HR 3.04, p = 0.001) were associated with worse PFS. Patients with new postoperative alterations in the context of preoperative alteration(s) also had a significantly shorter PFS compared with other groups (HR 4.28, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: High levels of perioperative ctDNA and new postoperative ctDNA alterations in the context of preoperative alterations predict worse outcomes in patients undergoing resection for peritoneal metastases. This may highlight a role for longitudinal ctDNA surveillance in this population.","Baumgartner, Joel M; Riviere, Paul; Lanman, Richard B; Kelly, Kaitlyn J; Veerapong, Jula; Lowy, Andrew M; Kurzrock, Razelle",Ann Surg Oncol,255,1

We aimed to assess temporal trends in primary care-recorded common mental illness, episodes of self-harm, psychotropic medication prescribing, and general practitioner (GP) referrals to mental health services during the COVID-19 emergency in the UK. METHODS: We did a population-based cohort study using primary care electronic health records from general practices registered on the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We included patient records from Jan 1, 2010, to Sept 10, 2020, to establish long-term trends and patterns of seasonality, but focused primarily on the period January, 2019-September, 2020. We extracted data on clinical codes entered into patient records to estimate the incidence of depression and anxiety disorders, self-harm, prescriptions for antidepressants and benzodiazepines, and GP referrals to mental health services, and assessed event rates of all psychotropic prescriptions and self-harm. We used mean-dispersion negative binomial regression models to predict expected monthly incidence and overall event rates, which were then compared with observed rates to assess the percentage reduction in incidence and event rates after March, 2020. We also stratified analyses by sex, age group, and practice-level Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles. FINDINGS: We identified 14â210â507 patients from 1697 UK general practices registered in the CPRD databases. In April, 2020, compared with expected rates, the incidence of primary care-recorded depression had reduced by 43·0% (95% CI 38·3-47·4), anxiety disorders by 47·8% (44·3-51·2), and first antidepressant prescribing by 36·4% (33·9-38·8) in English general practices. Reductions in first diagnoses of depression and anxiety disorders were largest for adults of working age (18-44 and 45-64 years) and for patients registered at practices in more deprived areas. The incidence of self-harm was 37·6% (34·8-40·3%) lower than expected in April, 2020, and the reduction was greatest for women and individuals aged younger than 45 years. By September, 2020, rates of incident depression, anxiety disorder, and self-harm were similar to expected levels. In Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, rates of incident depression and anxiety disorder remained around a third lower than expected to September, 2020. In April, 2020, the rate of referral to mental health services was less than a quarter of the expected rate for the time of year (75·3% reduction [74·0-76·4]). INTERPRETATION: Consequences of the considerable reductions in primary care-recorded mental illness and self-harm could include more patients subsequently presenting with greater severity of mental illness and increasing incidence of non-fatal self-harm and suicide. Addressing the effects of future lockdowns and longer-term impacts of economic instability on mental health should be prioritised.

The market has seen a recent influx of unproven extraoral scavengers (EOSs), which claim to reduce the risk of particulate spread.Aims To investigate the efficacy of a commercially available EOS device on contamination reduction during dental aerosol generating procedures (AGPs). The secondary aim was to investigate differences between open and closed dental operatories.Method Dental procedures were simulated on a dental manikin using citric acid (10%) added to the water lines with universal indicating paper (UIP) placed in strategic locations in the operatory, on the clinician and assistant. Chromatic change related to settling of splatter containing citric acid on the UIP was analysed to calculate percentage intensity of splatter contamination.Results EOSs resulted in 20% reduction in frequency and 75% reduction in mean intensity of contamination of operatory sites. There was a 33% and 76% reduction in mean intensity contamination for clinician and assistant, respectively. Use of rubber dam and four-handed dentistry resulted in further reduction.Discussion This exploratory study demonstrates contamination by splatter in a simulated dental setting. The concern in dentistry regarding aerosol requires further quantitative investigation of smaller particles.Conclusions The routine use of four-handed dentistry and rubber dam should continue where possible to maximise risk mitigation during AGPs. However, on the basis of our findings, the use of an EOS device can further mitigate the magnitude and concentration of splatter.","Shahdad, Shakeel; Patel, Tulsi; Hindocha, Annika; Cagney, Neil; Mueller, Jens-Dominik; Seoudi, Noha; Morgan, Claire; Din, Ahmed",Br. dent. j,255,16

It examined the frequency of words used in Korean and Japanese tweets regarding COVID-19 and the corresponding changes in their interests. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed Twitter posts (Tweets) from February 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020 to determine public opinion of the COVID-19 pandemic in Korea and Japan. We collected data from Twitter (https://twitter.com/), a major social media platform in Korea and Japan. Python 3.7 Library was used for data collection. Data analysis included KR-WordRank and frequency analyses in Korea and Japan, respectively. Heat diagrams, word clouds, and rank flowcharts were also used. RESULTS: Overall, 1,470,673 and 4,195,457 tweets were collected from Korea and Japan, respectively. The word trend in Korea and Japan was analyzed every 5 days. The word cloud analysis revealed ""COVID-19"", ""Shinchonji"", ""Mask"", ""Daegu"", and ""Travel"" as frequently used words in Korea. While in Japan, ""COVID-19"", ""Mask"", ""Test"", ""Impact"", and ""China"" were identified as high-frequency words. They were divided into four categories: social distancing, prevention, issue, and emotion for the rank flowcharts. Concerning emotion, ""Overcome"" and ""Support"" increased from February in Korea, while ""Worry"" and ""Anxiety"" decreased in Japan from April 1. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the trend, people's interests in the economy were high in both countries, indicating their reservations on the economic downturn. Therefore, focusing policies toward economic stability is essential. Although the interest in prevention increased since April in both countries, the general public's relaxation regarding COVID-19 was also observed.","Lee, Hocheol; Noh, Eun Bi; Choi, Sea Hwan; Zhao, Bo; Nam, Eun Woo",Healthc Inform Res,255,22

Increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers are associated with development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The aim of the present study was to determine which cytokines are associated with respiratory insufficiency in patients hospitalised for COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on 67 consecutive patients were collected between March 8 and March 30, 2020. PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F) was calculated at hospital admission. The following cytokines were analysed: interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1&#945;, IL-18, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-ß, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), soluble IL-2 receptor alpha (sIL-2R&#945;; CD25), IL-12ß, IL-3, interferon (IFN) &#945;2a, monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG), monocyte-chemotactic protein 3 (MCP3) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). RESULTS: P/F lower than 300 was recorded in 22 out of 67 patients (32.8%). P/F strongly correlated with IL-6 (r = -0.62, P < 0.0001), M-CSF (r = -0.63, P < 0.0001), sIL-2R&#945; (r = -0.54, P < 0.0001), and HGF (r = -0.53, P < 0.0001). ROC curve analyses for IL-6 (AUC 0.83, 95% CI 0.73-0.93, P < 0.0001), M-CSF (AUC 0.87, 95% CI 0.79-0.96, P < 0.0001), HGF (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.70-0.93, P < 0.0001), and sIL-2R&#945; (AUC 0.80, 95% CI, 0.69-0.90, P < 0.0001) showed that these four soluble factors were highly significant. All four soluble factors correlated with LDH, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, and CRP. CONCLUSION: IL-6, M-CSF, sIL-2R&#945;, and HGF are possibly involved in the main biological processes of severe COVID-19, mirroring the level of systemic hyperinflammatory state, the level of lung inflammation, and the severity of organ damage.","Quartuccio, Luca; Fabris, Martina; Sonaglia, Arianna; Peghin, Maddalena; Domenis, Rossana; Cifù, Adriana; Curcio, Francesco; Tascini, Carlo",Cytokine,255,15

METHODS: History of gestation and the family was taken. Combined with prenatal ultrasonography and the phenotype of the abortus, a diagnosis was made for the proband. Fetal tissue and peripheral blood samples of its parents were collected for the extraction of genomic DNA. Whole exome sequencing was carried out to detect mutations related to the phenotype. Suspected mutations were verified in the parents through Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Prenatal ultrasound found that the forearms and hands of the fetus were anomalous, in addition with poorly formed vermis cerebellum, slight micrognathia, and increased echo of bilateral renal parenchyma. Examination of the abortus has noted upper limb and facial malformations. Whole exome sequencing revealed that the fetus carried a heterozygous c.2118delG (p.Lys706fs) frameshift mutation of the NIPBL gene. The same mutation was not found in either parent. CONCLUSION: The heterozygous c.2118delG (p.Lys706fs) frameshift mutation of the NIPBL gene probably underlies the CdLS in the fetus.

The interactions among market sizes, MNF's competition with local rival and the global tax rules play key roles in the MNF's decisions. In this paper, we study the preferences of a MNF and its contract manufacturer (CM) over two manufacturing outsourcing structures and investigate whether their objective conflicts can be reconciled. The MNF relies on the CM for production and sells goods in both Chinese and Southeast Asian markets. It is optional for the MNF to use a CM located in China, but has to suffer from the CM's differential prices because of China's partial value-added tax (VAT) refund policy. It is also optional for the MNF to use a CM located in Southeast Asia, resulting in uniform production fee for the goods sold in two markets. The former is traditional outsourcing structure (TS), and the latter is shifted outsourcing structure (SS). Interestingly, we find that, the MNF may first prefer SS, then prefer TS, and back to prefer SS, as the relative market potential between the Southeast Asian market and the Chinese market increases. The CM's preferences may switch twice, too. We identify the opportunities where the preferences of the MNF and the CM are aligned, which are driven by China's partial VAT refund policy.","Niu, Baozhuang; Li, Qiyang; Liu, Yaoqi",Int J Prod Econ,255,8

However, the jump to clinical testing was lethal in some cases as a full understanding of the mechanism of antiviral activity as opposed to pleiotropic activity/toxicity for these drugs was lacking. Through parallel lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses we observed massive reorganization of lipid profiles of infected Vero E6 cells, especially plasmalogens that correlated with increased levels of virus replication. Niclosamide (NIC), a poorly soluble anti-helminth drug identified for repurposed treatment of COVID-19, reduced the total lipid profile that would otherwise amplify during virus infection. NIC treatment reduced the abundance of plasmalogens, diacylglycerides, and ceramides, which are required for virus production. Future screens of approved drugs may identify more druggable compounds than NIC that can safely but effectively counter SARS-CoV-2 subversion of lipid metabolism thereby reducing virus replication. However, these data support the consideration of niclosamide as a potential COVID-19 therapeutic given its modulation of lipophagy leading to the reduction of virus egress and the subsequent regulation of key lipid mediators of pathological inflammation.","Garrett, Timothy; Coatsworth, Heather; Mahmud, Iqbal; Hamerly, Timothy; Stephenson, Caroline J.; Yazd, Hoda; Ayers, Jasmine B; Miller, Megan; Lednicky, John A; Dinglasan, Rhoel R.",,255,16

In the fight for attention, the posts containing images have more chances to make users stop scrolling through the crowded news feed than the posts containing only text. The effect is enhanced if the photos that are used in the posts are professional grade. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more businesses have moved to online. Every business makes efforts to catch the attention of potential customers with high quality images. These situations could lead to intended or accidental image copyright infringement. This paper proposes a system that can be used to detect and avoid copyright infringement. Photographers can use it to register their photos and businesses can use it to check if the image they want to use is copyright protected or not. If it is, the system also allows the purchase of the right to use the photo. The solution is based on blockchain because of its immutability property. Businesses can look for images on many sites, thus it is very probable that recompressed versions of the same photo would be stored in different places. Therefore, it is important to develop an algorithm that can extract a signature that is resistant to JPEG compression from the image.

PIMS-TS is thought to be a post- SARS-CoV-2 immune dysregulation with excessive inflammatory cytokine release. We studied 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations in children with PIMS-TS, admitted to a tertiary paediatric hospital in the United Kingdom (U.K), due to its postulated role in cytokine regulation and immune response. Eighteen children [median (range) age 8.9 (0.3 to 14.6) years, male=10] met the case definition. Majority were of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) origin [89%, 16/18]. Positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were present in 94% (17/18) and RNA by PCR in 6% (1/18). 72% of the cohort were vitamin D deficient (<30nmol/L). The mean 25OHD concentration was significantly lower when compared to the population mean from the 2015/16 National Diet and Nutrition Survey (children aged 4-10 years) [24 vs 54nmol/L (95% CI: -38.6, -19.7); p<0.001]. The PICU group had lower mean 25OHD concentrations compared to the non-PICU group, but this was not statistically significant [19.5 vs 31.9 nmol/L; p=0.11]. The higher susceptibility of BAME children to PIMS-TS and also vitamin D deficiency merits contemplation. Whilst any link between vitamin D deficiency and the severity of COVID-19 and related conditions including PIMS-TS requires further evidence, public health measures to improve vitamin D status of the U.K BAME population has been long overdue.","Darren, Angeline; Osman, Meissa; Masilamani, Kavitha; Habib Ali, Syed; Kanthimathinathan, Hari Krishnan; Chikermane, Ashish; Al-Abadi, Eslam; Welch, Steven B; Hackett, Scott; Scholefield, Barnaby R; Uday, Suma; Jyothish, Deepthi",Br J Nutr,255,10

METHODS: Participants were eligible for MMR and varicella immunity screening if they were an employee receiving primary care in an employer-sponsored health center between January 1, 2019 and November 1, 2020 who could not provide proof of immunization and 1) had it recommended by their provider, 2) specifically requested immunity testing (often because they had heard of measles outbreaks in their country of origin), or 3) were seen for an immigration physical for their Green Card application. RESULTS: Overall, 3494 patients were screened for their MMR immunity. Of these, 3057 were also screened for varicella immunity. Among these patients, 13.9% lacked measles immunity, 0.83% lacked immunity to all 3 components of MMR, and 13.2% lacked varicella immunity. Among the 262 patients who presented specifically for immunity screening, the rates of lacking immunity were higher for all conditions: 22.7% lacked measles immunity and 9.2% lacked varicella immunity. CONCLUSION: Given declines in immunizations during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is reason to be concerned that measles and varicella-associated morbidity and mortality may rise. Employers, especially those with large foreign-born populations or who require international travel may want to educate their populations about common contagious illnesses and offer immunity validation or vaccinations at no or low cost.","Ezeji-Okoye, Stephen; Bilodeau, Brittney L; Madhusudhan, Divya K; Pruett, Eileen; Thokala, Sujith; Bravata, Dena M",J Prim Care Community Health,255,1

He wanted to know if Thomas knew anything about these conditions.

Although many studies have pointed to the role of systemic racism in COVID-19 racial/ethnic disparities, few studies have examined the contribution of racial segregation. Residential segregation is associated with differing health outcomes by race/ethnicity for various diseases, including HIV. This commentary documents differing HIV and COVID-19 outcomes and service delivery by race/ethnicity and the crucial role of racial segregation. Using publicly available Census data, we divide US counties into quintiles by percentage of non-Hispanic white residents and examine HIV diagnoses and COVID-19 per 100,000 population. HIV diagnoses decrease as the proportion of white residents increase across US counties. COVID-19 diagnoses follow a similar pattern: Counties with the highest proportion of white residents have the fewest cases of COVID-19 irrespective of geographic region or state political party inclination (i.e., red or blue states). Moreover, comparatively fewer COVID-19 diagnoses have occurred in primarily white counties throughout the duration of the US COVID-19 pandemic. Systemic drivers place racial minorities at greater risk for COVID-19 and HIV. Individual-level characteristics (e.g., underlying health conditions for COVID-19 or risk behavior for HIV) do not fully explain excess disease burden in racial minority communities. Corresponding interventions must use structural- and policy-level solutions to address racial and ethnic health disparities.","Millett, Gregorio A; Honermann, Brian; Jones, Austin; Lankiewicz, Elise; Sherwood, Jennifer; Blumenthal, Susan; Sayas, Asal",AIDS Patient Care STDS,255,21

Debido a su similitud clínica y microbiológica con el agente del síndrome respiratorio agudo grave (SARS por sus siglas en inglés), el SARS-CoV1, que afecto a China en el año 2003, fue bautizado como SARS-CoV2, y la enfermedad que produce como COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 2019). Desde su identificación el mundo médico se vio inundado de reportes estadísticos, tablas y cifras que hacen al comportamiento epidemiológico del SARSCoV2, pero pocos autores han focalizado su investigación en los mecanismos patogénicos y si lo han hecho sus artículos han sido diluidos por la vorágine de datos estadísticos. El objetivo del presente trabajo es profundizar en los aspectos fisiopatológicos de la infección por SARS-CoV2 para lo cual realicé una revisión de la literatura desde el inicio de la actual pandemia hasta el mes de junio de 2020, utilizando para la búsqueda Mendeley y PubMed, centrado sobre todo en la capacidad del virus de alterar el delicado balance entre la angiotensina II y sus antagonistas, analizar las posibles razones de la peor evolución en un subgrupo de pacientes y proponer medidas terapéuticas enfocadas en estos hallazgos. El SARS-CoV2 infecta células que expresan el receptor primario para el virus, la enzima ACE2, presente en epitelio intestinal y respiratorio, así como en endotelio. Genera inicialmente hipoxia por lesión alveolar para luego generar disfunción endotelial por lesión directa, lesión mediada por anticuerpos, tormenta de citoquinas y alteración del balance entre la angiotensina II y sus antagonistas funcionales, con eventual trombosis en territorio pulmonar y sistémico, así como hemólisis angiopática y por hiperactividad macrofágica. La retroalimentación positiva entre hipoxia, inflamación y angiotensina II potencian el desarrollo de un síndrome de distrés y fallo multiorgánico, con escalada de la mortalidad. El análisis de la fisiopatología probable en la infección por SARS-CoV2 permite sacar algunas conclusiones siendo las centrales que el endotelio es uno de los actores centrales en la patogenia de la enfermedad y que los pacientes con mayor riesgo de complicaciones son aquellos con disfunción endotelial previa debida a la presencia de obesidad, diabetes mellitus o hipertensión, así como que existen diferentes fases o estadios, cada uno con una posible intervención terapéutica particular, es decir, que la COVID-19 es diferente entre pacientes y en el mismo paciente es diferente en el tiempo, con cada momento requiriendo una intervención terapéutica particular.","Mateos, Edgard Alexis",An.

Recent advances in virology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and clinical management of COVID-19 have contributed to the control and prevention of this disease, but re-positivity of SARS-CoV-2 in recovered COVID-19 patients has brought a new challenge for this worldwide anti-viral battle. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen is widely used in clinical diagnosis, but a positive RT-PCR result may be multifactorial, including false positive, SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment shedding, reinfection of SARS-CoV-2, or re-activation of COVID-19. Re-infection of SARS-CoV-2 or re-activation of COVID-19 is an indicator of live viral carriers and isolation/treatment is needed, but SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment shedding is not. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is recently reported to integrate into the host genome, but the far-reaching outcome is currently unclear. Therefore, it is critical for appropriate manipulation and prevention of COVID-19 to distinguish these causal factors of SARS-CoV-2 re-positivity. In this review article, we updated the current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 re-positivity in discharged COVID-19 patients with a focus on re-infection and re-activation. We proposed a hypothetical flowchart for handling of the SARS-CoV-2 re-positive cases.","Xia, Jiliang; Zeng, Ying; Tan, Zhenghong; Chen, Ting; Hu, Weilan; Shuai, Shulei; Cao, Deliang; Zeng, Xi",AIDS rev,255,3

One hypothesis is that population in SSA has been exposed to other coronaviruses prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulted in some degree of cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis. Our goal was to evaluate this hypothesis by comparing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibodies in pre-pandemic plasma samples collected from SSA and USA. METHOD: Pre-COVID-19 pandemic plasma samples from SSA and USA were collected and tested by immunofluorescence assay against the spike and nucleocapid proteins of all known human coronaviruses (HCoV). RESULTS: Significantly higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 serological cross-reactivity was detected in samples from SSA compared to USA. Majority of these cross-reactive samples cross-recognized SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein together with recognition of spike proteins from other HCoVs. Since nucleocapsid proteins from HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were detected by majority of samples, it implicates prior exposure to these two HCoVs as the likely source for cross-reactive antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: Low SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease in SSA appears to correlate with pre-pandemic serological cross-recognition of HCoVs, which are substantially more prevalent in SSA than USA.","Tso, For Yue; Lidenge, Salum J; Peña, Phoebe B; Clegg, Ashley A; Ngowi, John R; Mwaiselage, Julius; Ngalamika, Owen; Julius, Peter; West, John T; Wood, Charles",Int. j. infect. dis,255,16

METHODS: We enrolled 174 patients with DKD from three centres from January 2010 to July 2017. The severity and extent of arteriosclerosis were analysed on sections based on dual immunohistochemical staining of CD31 and &#945;-smooth muscle actin. An X-tile plot was used to determine the optimal cut-off value. The primary endpoint was renal survival (RS), defined as the duration from renal biopsy to end-stage renal disease or death. RESULTS: The baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 135 qualified patients was 45 (29 ~ 70) ml/min per 1.73 m2, and the average 24-h urine protein was 4.52 (2.45 ~ 7.66) g/24 h. The number of glomeruli in the biopsy specimens was 21.07 ± 9.7. The proportion of severe arteriosclerosis in the kidney positively correlated with the Renal Pathology Society glomerular classification (r = 0.28, P < 0.012), interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) (r = 0.39, P < 0.001), urine protein (r = 0.213, P = 0.013), systolic BP (r = 0.305, P = 0.000), and age (r = 0.220, P = 0.010) and significantly negatively correlated with baseline eGFR (r = - 0.285, P = 0.001). In the multivariable model, the primary outcomes were significantly correlated with glomerular class (HR: 1.72, CI: 1.15 ~ 2.57), IFTA (HR: 1.96, CI: 1.26 ~ 3.06) and the modified arteriosclerosis score (HR: 2.21, CI: 1.18 ~ 4.13). After risk adjustment, RS was independently associated with the baseline eGFR (HR: 0.97, CI: 0.96 ~ 0.98), urine proteinuria (HR: 1.10, CI: 1.04 ~ 1.17) and the modified arteriosclerosis score (HR: 2.01, CI: 1.10 ~ 3.67), and the nomogram exhibited good calibration and acceptable discrimination (C-index = 0.82, CI: 0.75 ~ 0.87).

The aim of this prospective cohort study is to assess nutrition status and outcome in patients with COVID-19 following ICU discharge. METHODS: Patients requiring a minimum of 14 days' stay in the ICU with mechanical ventilation were included. Nutrition status was assessed at inclusion (ICU discharge) and follow-up (after 15, 30, and 60 days). All patients had standardized medical nutrition therapy with defined targets regarding energy (30 kcal/kg/d) and protein intake (1.5 g/kg/d). RESULTS: Fifteen patients were included (67% males); the median age was 60 (33-75) years old. Body mass index at ICU admission was 25.7 (IQR, 24-31) kg/m². After a median ICU stay of 33 (IQR, 26-39) days, malnutrition was present in all patients (11.3% median weight loss and/or low muscle mass based on handgrip strength measurement). Because of postintubation dysphagia in 60% of patients, enteral nutrition was administered (57% nasogastric tube; 43% percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy). After 2 months, a significant improvement in muscle strength was observed (median handgrip strength, 64.7% [IQR, 51%-73%] of the predicted values for age vs 19% [IQR, 4.8%-28.4%] at ICU discharge [P < 0.0005]), as well as weight gain of 4.3 kg (IQR, 2.7-6.7 kg) (P < 0.0002).

Variability in specimens and methods prevent standardization of RT-qPCR assays and reliable quantitative reporting to assess viral load. We developed an extraction-free RT-qPCR assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and monitored viral load until convalescence in COVID-19 patients. Comparison of 231 matched anterior nares swab and saliva specimens demonstrated that extraction-free testing of saliva has equivalent analytical and clinical assay performance compared to testing of RNA extracts from either anterior nares or saliva specimens. Analysis of specimen pairs revealed higher viral loads in the nasal cavity compared to the oral cavity, although this difference did not impact clinical sensitivity for COVID-19. Extraction-free testing of a combination specimen consisting of both nasal swab and saliva is also demonstrated. Assessment of viral load by RT-qPCR and parallel digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) revealed that cycle threshold (Ct) values less than approximately 30 correlated well with viral load, whereas Ct values greater than 30 correspond to low viral loads <10 copies/{micro}L. Therefore, extraction-free saliva testing maximizes testing efficiency without compromising assay performance and approximates viral loads >10 copies/{micro}L. This technology can facilitate high-throughput laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2, monitor viral load in individual patients, and assess efficacy of therapies for COVID-19.","Qiu, Yue; Lu, Ling; Gao, Dexiang; McGrath, Patrick; Han, Chann; Kogut, Igor; Blomquist, Bob; Yao, Xin; Zevallos, Jose P; Harry, Brian; Lu, Shi-long",,255,21

In this work, we performed the first evaluation of the QIAstat-Dx respiratory SARS-CoV-2 panel (QIAstat-SARS) for SARS-CoV-2 detection. This assay is the first rapid multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay, including SARS-CoV-2 detection, and is fully compatible with a non-PCR-trained laboratory or point-of-care (PoC) testing. This evaluation was performed using 69 primary clinical samples (66 nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], 1 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sample [BAL], 1 tracheal aspirate sample, and 1 bronchial aspirate sample) comparing SARS-CoV-2 detection with the currently WHO-recommended reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) (WHO-RT-PCR) workflow. Additionally, a comparative limit of detection (LoD) assessment was performed for QIAstat-SARS and WHO-RT-PCR using a quantified clinical sample. Compatibility of sample pretreatment for viral neutralization or viscous samples with the QIAstat-SARS system were also tested. The QIAstat-Dx respiratory SARS-CoV-2 panel demonstrated a sensitivity comparable to that of the WHO-recommended assay with a limit of detection at 1,000 copies/ml. The overall percent agreement between QIAstat-Dx SARS and WHO-RT-PCR on 69 clinical samples was 97% with a sensitivity of 100% (40/40) and specificity at 93% (27/29). No cross-reaction was encountered for any other respiratory viruses or bacteria included in the panel. The QIAstat-SARS rapid multiplex PCR panel provides a highly sensitive, robust, and accurate assay for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. This assay allows rapid decisions even in non-PCR-trained laboratory or point-of-care testing, allowing innovative organization.","Visseaux, Benoit; Le Hingrat, Quentin; Collin, Gilles; Bouzid, Donia; Lebourgeois, Samuel; Le Pluart, Diane; Deconinck, Laurène; Lescure, François-Xavier; Lucet, Jean-Christophe; Bouadma, Lila; Timsit, Jean-François; Descamps, Diane; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Casalino, Enrique; Houhou-Fidouh, Nadhira",J. clin. microbiol,255,24

Seven (7) distinct yeasts were isolated and identified using cultural, microscopy and biochemical tests (temperature tolerance, flocculation, ethanol tolerance, H2S production and killer toxin production and the ability to assimilate and ferment sugars. The yeast isolates were screened using refractometric and spectrophotometric methods to select the isolate with the best ability for wine production. This isolate was molecularly characterized, grown in 1 L of potatoes dextrose broth, freeze dried and used for wine production. The population of yeast, bacteria and the physicochemical analysis of the must were monitored during fermentation. Populations of bacteria in the wine were assessed by standard pour plate count. The proximate content and physicochemical properties of the produced wine before and after ageing, as well as the sensorial quality of the produced wine was determined. All the yeast isolates possessed the ability to flocculate, tolerate ethanol concentration of between 5 and 20% and temperature range of 30-45 °C, produced low concentration of H2S and does not produce killer toxins. A palm wine isolate, identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae X01 was selected as the best isolate with the most ability for wine production. The total yeast count increases as the period of fermentation progressed while the total viable bacterial count reduced as the fermentation period progressed. There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in the physicochemical properties of the must during fermentation. At the end of the fermentation, the produced wine had 5.22% and 4.86% ethanol content for S. cerevisiae QA23 and S. cerevisiae X01 respectively. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between the proximate and physicochemical compositions of the produced wine before and after ageing using Saccharomyces cerevisiae X01 when compared to the control S. cerevisiae QA23. This study revealed that the Nigerian locally sourced S. cerevisiae X01 can be used as an alternative substrate for industrial scale production of wine with a mild alcoholic content.","Oladoja, Emmanuel Olalekan; Oyewole, Oluwafemi Adebayo; Okeke, Susan Kingsley; Azuh, Victor Okechukwu; Oladoja, Olakunle Israel; Jagaba, Aliyu",Arch. microbiol,255,20

It takes two forms: one is local, namely diffusion in space, and other is related to travel. With the advancement of transportation system, it is possible for diseases to move from one place to an entirely separate place very quickly. In a developing country like India, the mass movement of large numbers of individuals creates the possibility of spread of common infectious diseases. This has led to the study of infectious disease model to describe the infection during transport. An SIRS-type epidemic model is formulated to illustrate the dynamics of such infectious disease propagation between two cities due to population dispersal. The most important threshold parameter, namely the basic reproduction number, is derived, and the possibility of existence of backward bifurcation is examined, as the existence of backward bifurcation is very unsettling for disease control and it is vital to know from modeling analysis when it can occur. It is shown that dispersal of populations would make the disease control difficult in comparison with nondispersal case. Optimal vaccination and treatment controls are determined. Further to find the best cost-effective strategy, cost-effectiveness analysis is also performed. Though it is not a case study, simulation work suggests that the proposed model can also be used in studying the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, 2003.","Khatua, Anupam; Kar, Tapan Kumar; Nandi, Swapan Kumar; Jana, Soovoojeet; Kang, Yun",Energy Ecol Environ,255,16

The current pharmaceutical pipeline is disproportional focused on oncology, where about 1/3 of all phases of development is in this therapeutic area. The emphasis brings about substantial breakthroughs and has made positive impact on the quality of life. However, oncology remains a threat to human existence. To facilitate this process, a comprehensive list of novel/first molecularly targeted oncology drug approvals by the FDA from 2017 to 2020 is assessed. Here, we focus on molecularly targeted oncology drugs and not cytotoxic ones, although the latter remain important. To achieve this purpose, besides their sponsors, years of approval, drug classes, and cancer indications, clinical significance is included. The results show that approved molecularly targeted drugs span across diverse classes, including small molecule receptor inhibitors, and biologics such as monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, check-point inhibitors (i.e., PD1, PDL1, CTLA4) and CAR-T cell therapies. Although complete cure of cancer remains limited, we have made substantial inroads and more is yet to come.

The CoV spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) is an attractive vaccine target but is undermined by limited immunogenicity. We describe a dimeric form of MERS-CoV RBD that overcomes this limitation. The RBD-dimer significantly increased neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers compared to conventional monomeric form and protected mice against MERS-CoV infection. Crystal structure showed RBD-dimer fully exposed dual receptor-binding motifs, the major target for NAbs. Structure-guided design further yielded a stable version of RBD-dimer as a tandem repeat single-chain (RBD-sc-dimer) which retained the vaccine potency. We generalized this strategy to design vaccines against COVID-19 and SARS, achieving 10- to 100-fold enhancement of NAb titers. RBD-sc-dimers in pilot scale production yielded high yields, supporting their scalability for further clinical development.

Design/methodology/approach: We perfomed an observational study of ICF files of people with disabilities pre- and post-three-months lockdown imposed by the government to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: ICF qualifiers such as performing the daily routine (d230), using communication devices and techniques (d360) and doing housework (d640) showed a significant decrease of the disabilities (p &lt; 0.05). Instead, a significant increase (p &lt; 0.05) in disability was evident in relating with strangers (d730);informal social relationships (d750);acquiring, keeping and terminating a job (d845);complex economic transactions (d865);community life (d910);and recreation and leisure (d920). Practical implications: Telerehabilitation should not be regarded as home-based rehabilitation delivered through technology.

The proposed sensor was modeled on the basis of the total internal reflection (TIR) technique for real-time detection of ligand-analyte immobilization in the sensing region. The refractive index (RI) of the sensing region is changed due to the interaction of different concentrations of the ligand-analyte, thus impacting surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) excitation of the multi-layer sensor interface. The performance of the proposed sensor was numerically investigated by using the transfer matrix method (TMM) and the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The proposed SPR biosensor provides fast and accurate early-stage diagnosis of the COVID-19 virus, which is crucial in limiting the spread of the pandemic. In addition, the performance of the proposed sensor was investigated numerically with different ligand-analytes: (i) the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as ligand and the COVID-19 virus spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) as analyte, (ii) the virus spike RBD as ligand and the virus anti-spike protein (IgM, IgG) as analyte and (iii) the specific probe as ligand and the COVID-19 virus single-standard ribonucleic acid (RNA) as analyte. After the investigation, the sensitivity of the proposed sensor was found to provide 183.33°/refractive index unit (RIU) in SPR angle (Î¸SPR) and 833.33THz/RIU in SPR frequency (SPRF) for detection of the COVID-19 virus spike RBD; the sensitivity obtained 153.85°/RIU in SPR angle and 726.50THz/RIU in SPRF for detection of the anti-spike protein, and finally, the sensitivity obtained 140.35°/RIU in SPR angle and 500THz/RIU in SPRF for detection of viral RNA. It was observed that whole virus spike RBD detection sensitivity is higher than that of the other two detection processes. Highly sensitive two-dimensional (2D) materials were used to achieve significant enhancement in the Goos-Hänchen (GH) shift detection sensitivity and plasmonic properties of the conventional SPR sensor. The proposed sensor successfully senses the COVID-19 virus and offers additional (1 + 0.55) × L times sensitivity owing to the added graphene layers. Besides, the performance of the proposed sensor was analyzed based on detection accuracy (DA), the figure of merit (FOM), signal-noise ratio (SNR), and quality factor (QF). Based on its performance analysis, it is expected that the proposed sensor may reduce lengthy procedures, false positive results, and clinical costs, compared to traditional sensors. The performance of the proposed sensor model was checked using the TMM algorithm and validated by the FDTD technique.","Akib, Tarik Bin Abdul; Mou, Samia Ferdous; Rahman, Md Motiur; Rana, Md Masud; Islam, Md Rabiul; Mehedi, Ibrahim M; Mahmud, M A Parvez; Kouzani, Abbas Z",Sensors (Basel),255,21

Technology helps people schedule meetings as remote videoconferencing sessions rather than face-to-face interactions. Psychologists are in high demand because of an increase in stress as a result of COVID-19, and videoconferencing provides an opportunity for mental health clinicians to treat current and new referrals. However, shifting treatment from face-to-face to videoconferencing is not simple: both psychologists and clients miss in-person information cues, including body language. OBJECTIVE: This review proposes a new theoretical framework to guide the design of future studies examining the impact of a computer as a mediator of psychologist-client relationships and the influence of videoconferencing on the relationship process. METHODS: We conducted a literature review including studies focused on communication and key concepts of the therapeutic relationship and therapeutic alliance. RESULTS: Studies have reported that clients are generally satisfied with videoconference therapy in terms of the relationship with their therapists and the establishment of the therapeutic alliance. Conversely, studies indicate that psychologists continue to highlight difficulties in establishing the same quality of therapeutic relationship and therapeutic alliance. The contrasting experiences might underlie the differences in the type of emotional and cognitive work required by both actors in any therapy session; furthermore, the computer seems to take part in their interaction not only as a vehicle to transmit messages but also as an active part of the communication. A new model of interaction and relationship is proposed, taking into account the presence of the computer, along with further hypotheses. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to consider the computer as having an active role in the client-psychologist relationship; thus, it is a third party to the communication that either assists or interferes with the interaction between psychologists and clients.","Cataldo, Francesco; Chang, Shanton; Mendoza, Antonette; Buchanan, George",JMIR Ment Health,255,1

Sequence specificity was ensured by both the ligation process and Cas13a/crRNA recognition, allowing us to identify viral RNA mutation. Light-up RNA aptamer allows sensitive output of amplification signals via target-activated ribonuclease activity of CRISPR-Cas13a. The RNA virus assay has been designed to detect coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and SARS, as well as the influenza viruses such as, H1N1, H7N9, and H9N2. It was accommodated to sense as low as 82 copies of SARS-CoV-2. Particularly, it allowed us to strictly discriminate key mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 variant, D614G, which may induce higher epidemic and pathogenetic risk.

With learning promising to be online, at least in part, for the near future, instructors may be thinking of providing online collaborative learning opportunities to their students who are increasingly isolated from their peers because of social distancing guidelines. This paper aims to provide design recommendations for online collaborative project-based learning exercises based on this research in a software engineering course at the university level. Design/methodology/approach: Through joint work between learning scientists, course instructors and software engineering practitioners, instructional design best practices of alignment between the context of the learners, the learning objectives, the task and the assessment are actualized in the design of collaborative programming projects for supporting learning. The design, first segments a short real-time collaborative exercise into tasks, each with a problem-solving phase where students participate in collaborative programming, and a reflection phase for reflecting on what they learned in the task. Within these phases, a role-assignment paradigm scaffolds collaboration by assigning groups of four students to four complementary roles that rotate after each task. Findings: By aligning each task with granular learning objectives, significant pre- to post-test learning from the exercise as well as each task is observed. Originality/value: The roles used in the paradigm discourage divide-and-conquer tendencies often associated with collaborative projects. By requiring students to discuss conflicting ideas to arrive at a consensus implementation, their ideas are made explicit, thus providing opportunities for clarifying misconceptions through discussion and learning from the collaboration.","Sankaranarayanan, Sreecharan; Kandimalla, Siddharth Reddy; Cao, Mengxin; Maronna, Ignacio; An, Haokang; Bogart, Chris; Murray, R.

All elective cases have been put off, but oncology cases need to be done to prevent progression of the disease. There is concern about minimally invasive surgery due to aerosol formation. Here we discuss how we have dealt with this in our colorectal surgery department taking into account current evidence about the danger of viral transmission during laparoscopic surgery. Discussion: We report a case of 28 years old female patient with carcinoma rectum. The patient had near total intestinal obstruction. She was operated on utilizing laparoscopic anterior resection. The air seal (CONMED, Utica, NY) and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was utilized for safe gas evacuation. There is no evidence against laparoscopic surgery, which suggest viral transmission. One should take utmost precautions using N95 masks and personal protective equipment (PPE). Air filtration products like aerosol, HEPA filters will be of great aid in safe evacuation of gases. Conclusion: At present, there is no solid evidence to suggest viral transmission through surgical smoke. We believe due to effective smoke containment, less blood loss, and less postoperative stay, laparoscopy will be a non-inferior option than open surgical procedure. We advise taking all precautions for operating room staff to lessen the danger of transmission.","Pawar, Tushar; Pokharkar, Ashish; Gori, Jayesh; Pandey, Diwakar; Rohila, Jitender; Dsouza, Ashwin; Saklani, Avanish",J Laparoendosc Adv Surg Tech A,255,1

Compared to its predecessor SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more infective for being highly contagious and exhibiting tighter binding with host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2). The entry of the virus into host cells is mediated by the interaction of its spike protein with hACE-2. Thus, a peptide that has a resemblance to hACE-2 but can overpower the spike protein-hACE-2 interaction will be a potential therapeutic to contain this virus. The non-interacting residues in the receptor-binding domain of hACE-2 have been mutated to generate a library of 136 new peptides. Out of this library, docking and virtual screening discover seven peptides that can exert a stronger interaction with the spike protein than hACE-2. A peptide derived from simultaneous mutation of all the non-interacting residues of hACE-2 yields almost three-fold stronger interaction than hACE-2 and thus turns out here to be the best peptide inhibitor of the novel coronavirus. The binding of the best peptide inhibitor with the spike protein is explored further by molecular dynamics, free energy, and principal component analysis, which demonstrate its efficacy compared to hACE-2. The delivery of the screened inhibitors with nanocarriers like metal-organic frameworks will be worthy of further consideration to boost their efficacy.","Panda, Saroj Kumar; Sen Gupta, Parth Sarthi; Biswal, Satyaranjan; Ray, Abhik Kumar; Rana, Malay Kumar",J Proteome Res,255,1

To date, the only proven route of transmission is the faecal–oral route, but a possible localisation of FCoV in the reproductive tract of tom cats is of concern, owing to the involvement of the male reproductive tract during FIP and to the presence of reproduction disorders in FCoV-endemic feline catteries. The aim of the study was to investigate the presence and localisation of FCoV in semen and/or in the reproductive tract of tom cats, and its possible association with seroconversion and viraemic phase. Methods: Blood, serum, semen and/or testicle samples were obtained from 46 tom cats. Serology was performed on 38 serum samples, nested reverse transcriptase PCR (nRT-PCR) and reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were performed on 39 blood samples and on 17 semen samples, and histology, immunohistochemistry and nRT-PCR were performed on 39 testicles. Results: Twenty-four of 38 serum samples were positive on serology. Semen samples were negative on RT-PCR and RT-qPCR for FCoV, while all blood samples were negative at both molecular methods, except for one sample positive at RT-qPCR with a very low viral load. All testicles were negative at immunohistochemistry, while six were positive at nRT-PCR for FCoV. Serology and blood PCR results suggest that the virus was present in the environment, stimulating transient seroconversion. FCoV seems not to localise in the semen of tom cats, making the venereal route as a way of transmission unlikely. Although viral RNA was found in some testicles, it could not be correlated with the viraemic phase. Conclusions and relevance_ In the light of these preliminary results, artificial insemination appears safer than natural mating as it eliminates the direct contact between animals, thus diminishing the probability of faecal–oral FCoV transmission.","Stranieri, Angelica; Probo, Monica; Pisu, Maria C; Fioletti, Alberto; Meazzi, Sara; Gelain, Maria E; Bonsembiante, Federico; Lauzi, Stefania; Paltrinieri, Saverio",J.

Methods: Using insurance claims data, we identified 48,657 adults who underwent ACL reconstruction from 2010-2015, had prescription drug insurance and had &#8805;1 year of continuous insurance enrollment postoperatively. Chronic opioid use was defined as filling &#8805;120 days' supply from 3-12 months postoperatively. Logistic and linear regression, controlled for age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index value, were used to determine associations of preoperative depression with binary and continuous outcomes, respectively. Results: Preoperatively, 2,237 patients (4.6%) had depression and 2,387 (4.9%) were taking opioids; patients with depression had 6.5 times the odds (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.8, 7.3) of taking opioids than patients without depression. Postoperatively, 25% of patients filled &#8805;1 opioid prescription; mean duration of use was 13 ± 11 days, and 362 patients (0.7%) had chronic use. Patients with preoperative depression were less likely than patients without depression to fill an opioid prescription postoperatively (OR 0.2, 95% CI: 0.2, 0.2). Of patients who filled opioid prescriptions postoperatively, those with preoperative depression were more likely to refill that prescription at least once (OR 2.0, 95% CI: 1.9, 2.2) but did not have greater odds of chronic use (OR 0.9, 95% CI: 0.5, 1.5). Preoperative depression was not associated with greater cumulative opioid consumption from 3-12 months postoperatively (ß = -40, 95% CI: -226, 146). Conclusion: Although patients with preoperative depression were more likely to take opioids preoperatively and to obtain &#8805;1 opioid refill postoperatively, they did not have greater odds of chronic postoperative opioid use or greater cumulative opioid consumption after ACL reconstruction.","Best, Matthew J; Harris, Andrew B; Mohler, Jessica M; Wilckens, John H",,255,10

As a low-cost alternative to the traditional approaches of responding to such crisis, data-driven approaches can help to identify more tailored response strategies and guide towards more informed decision-making. Recently, social media platforms helped researchers and practitioners with sufficient details and coverage to understand how communities respond to natural hazards through social media interactions. However, the empirical literature does not provide any comprehensive guidance on public reactions to active shootings as observed through social media interactions. This study adopted a holistic data analytics approach to collect large-scale social media data from Twitter (∼252K tweets, 04.17.20-05.20.20). The 2020 Nova Scotia Attacks were among the major shooting events observed during this period in addition to the unprecedented experiences people were having due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study used several natural language processing and data mining approaches (such as temporal heatmaps, word bigrams, and topic mining) to cluster the social media crisis communication patterns of active shootings and create infographics of the diverse needs, concerns, and reactions observed in the aftermath of such events. Key interactions include bailing out of shooters, shooting investigation, police response, gun violence, lessons learned from previous school (Sandy Hook) and mass shootings (El Paso), vehicle ramming (Toronto Van Attack), mobility issues and health concerns during COVID-19 pandemic, changes in economy and education systems. This study would allow first responders and emergency management officials to enhance the capacity of social sharing platforms and facilitate risk communication in no-notice scenarios. Additionally, the infographics could serve as a data dictionary in future active shooting scenarios to maximize peer influence.","Ahmed Rusho, M.; Ashraf Ahmed, Md Mohaimin Sadri Arif",Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives,255,13

METHODS: We prospectively collected data on thoracic malignancies surgeries from January 1 to April 30, 2020. We included patients from six high-volume thoracic surgery departments: Nancy and Strasbourg (France), Freiburg (Germany), Milano and Torino (Italy), and Montreal (Canada). The centers involved in this research are all located in the most impacted regions of the countries concerned. An assessment of COVID-19-related symptoms, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 infection, rates of hospital and intensive care unit admissions and deaths was performed for each patient. Every death was tested for COVID-19 by PCR. RESULTS: In the study period, 731 patients who underwent 734 surgical procedures were included.

Understanding consumer food stockpiling behavior during COVID-19 pandemic can provide critical information for governments and policymakers to adjust inventory and response strategies. This paper analyzed consumer food stockpiling behavior, including the change of food reserve scale and willingness to pay for fresh food reserves in COVID-19. Our paper shows that the scale of food reserve extends from 3.37 to 7.37 days after the outbreak of COVID-19; if available, consumers on average are willing to pay 18.14 yuan (60.47%) premium for fresh products reserves. The result shows that food stockpiling behavior is fueled by a set of multiple motivations and subjective risk perception. Female, high education level and high-income consumers were more likely to reserve larger scale food reserves, but consumers' willingness to pay for fresh food reserves is determined by income. This study was conducted when new infection cases continued to rise in the world. The story of food stockpiling during the COVID-19 pandemic in China is similar with the rest of world.

The study has been carried out in the Community of Madrid, which has the highest number of cases in Spain. The objective is to understand the incidence of COVID-19, the course of the disease if it occurs and the psychosocial and occupational impact on this population. METHODS: We included 345 patients (246 of haemophilia, 69 of von Willebrand Disease, 2 rare bleeding disorders and 28 carriers of haemophilia). A telephone survey was used to collect the data. RESULTS: 42 patients presented symptoms suggestive of infection by COVID-19 and in 6 cases the disease was confirmed by RT-PCR. The cumulative incidence of our series was 1.73%. It is worth noting the complexity of the management of COVID-19 in two patients on prophylaxis with non-factor replacement therapy. Adherence to the prescribed treatment was maintained by 95.5% of patients. Although 94% were independent for daily living activities, 42.4% had a recognised disability and 58% required assistance, provided by the Madrid Haemophilia Association (Ashemadrid) in 75%of cases. Only 4.4% of consultations were held in person. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with congenital bleeding disorders infected with SARS-CoV-2presented a mild course of the disease that did not require admission. Their identification and treatment by a specialist team from a Haemophilia Treatment Center is essential to make a correct assessment of the risk of haemorrhage/thrombosis.COVID-19 had a major impact on the psychosocial aspects of these patients which must be remedied with recovery plans.","Álvarez Román, M T; Butta Coll, N; García Barcenilla, S; Pérez González, L; de la Plaza Collazo, I; De la Corte Rodríguez, H; Romero Garrido, J A; Martín Salces, M; Rivas Pollmar, M I; Cebanu, T; González-Zorrilla, E; Acuña, P; Monzón Manzano, E; Merchán, E C; Trelles Martínez, R; Blanco Bañares, M J; Gutiérrez Alvariño, M; Jiménez Yuste, V",Haemophilia,255,1

Some young adults may engage in unhealthy eating practices to cope with social distancing and isolation during the pandemic, which could increase incidental weight gain. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of eating to cope with the pandemic with body weight change in young adults before versus after spread of COVID-19. METHODS: Data included the baseline (October/2018-October/2019) and follow-up (May/2020-July/2020) assessments from an ongoing longitudinal cohort recruited from Southern California. A diverse sample of participants (54% Hispanic; age = 19.72[.47] years; N = 1,820) completed online self-report measures of weight at baseline and follow-up and were given a checklist of pandemic coping behaviors including overeating (yes/no) and eating high fat or sugary foods (yes/no) to cope with social distancing and isolation during the pandemic. RESULTS: With and without adjusting for confounders, young adults who did versus did not report overeating to cope with the pandemic gained more weight from baseline to follow-up (5.55 vs. 2.54 lbs). Unhealthy food intake to cope with the pandemic was not associated with weight change. Baseline weight moderated the association of eating coping practices with weight change such that individuals with higher baseline weight gained more weight if they engaged in eating to cope behaviors versus not (p's&#8804;.001). CONCLUSIONS: Unhealthy eating behavior to cope with the pandemic and corresponding body weight increases may be occurring in young adults.

Transportation industry which is deemed as an essential activity should continue to operate through the lockdowns while making it certain to exercise social distancing. Although some researchers, Departments of Transportation (DOT), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and private organizations have provided vital information and guidelines to mitigate the unintended consequences of the pandemic, the impacts of COVID-19 on various types of transportation modes have been rarely analyzed and compared. This paper gives rich information into the system and cognizance of the effect of COVID-19 and the developments that the transportation area has needed to embrace so as to cling to the lockdown rules while being operational and productive. The study contributes towards advising policymakers, stakeholders, and agencies on certain insights gained from the management of the COVID-19 from a transportation area point of view. Moreover, four key regulations are concluded for leaders inside the transportation framework business to reevaluate and act to manage the pandemic emergency. This research analyzes how each sector has addressed the short-term and long-term effects of the pandemic and results of the study concluded that the survival of transportation industry is not solely reliant on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic but on the resilience adapted by the different sectors to cope up with the situation. The findings also indicate that transportation departments should include a management plan to reduce the aftermaths of the pandemic and use the lockdown as an opportunity to address surging maintenance backlogs, improve technology, and safeguard the workforce. © 2021 International Conference on Transportation and Development 2021: Transportation Operations, Technologies, and Safety - Selected Papers from the International Conference on Transportation and Development 2021.

METHODS: 27 pediatric patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were included. CT examination and molecular assay tests were performed from all participants. A standard checklist was utilized to extract information, and two radiologists separately reviewed the CT images. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 4.7 ± 4.16 (mean ± SD) years. Seventeen patients were female, and ten were male. The most common imaging finding was ground-glass opacities followed by consolidations. Seven patients had a single area of involvement, five patients had multiple areas of involvement, and four patients had diffuse involvement. The sensitivity of CT imaging in diagnosing infections was 66.67%. Also, some uncommon imaging findings were seen, such as a tree-in-bud and lung collapse. CONCLUSION: CT imaging shows less involvement in pediatric compared to adult patients, due to pediatric patients having a milder form of the disease.

Based on the stressor-strain-outcome paradigm, a research model was proposed and investigated using survey-based data through a structured questionnaire. The results found that the perceived threat of COVID-19 contagion (emotional and cognitive threat) was positively correlated with physiological anxiety, depression, and emotional exhaustion, which led toward agonistic behaviour. Further, perceived social support was a key moderator that negatively affected the relationships between agonistic behaviour and physiological anxiety, depression, and emotional exhaustion. These findings significantly contributed to the current literature concerning COVID-19 and pandemic-related effects on human behaviour.

The low-Mach turbulent large-eddy simulation-based Eulerian/point-particle Lagrangian methodology directly couples mass, momentum, energy, and species to capture droplet evaporation physics that supports the ability to distinguish between droplets that deposit and those that persist in the environment. The cough mechanism is modeled as a pulsed spray with a prescribed log-normal droplet size distribution. Simulations demonstrate direct droplet deposition lengths in excess of three meters while the persistence of droplet nuclei entrained within a buoyant plume is noted. Including the effect of protective barriers demonstrates effective mitigation of large-droplet transport. For coughs into a protective barrier, jet impingement and large-scale recirculation can drive droplets vertically and back toward the subject while supporting persistence of droplet nuclei. Simulations in quiescent conditions demonstrate droplet preferential concentrations due to the coupling between vortex ring shedding and the subsequent advection of a series of three-dimensional rings that tilt and rise vertically due to a misalignment between the initial principle vortex trajectory and gravity. These resolved coughing simulations note vortex ring formation, roll-up and breakdown, while entraining droplet nuclei for large distances and time scales.","Domino, S.

In this paper, we present our work using mixed-integer programming and simulation for redesigning routes and bus schedules for University of Michigan (UM)'s campus bus system during the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose a hub-and-spoke design and utilize real data of student activities to identify hub locations and bus stops to be used in the new routes. Using the same total number of buses to operate, each new bus route has 50\% or fewer seats being used and takes maximumly 15 minutes, to reduce disease transmission through expiratory aerosol. We sample a variety of scenarios that cover variations of peak demand, social-distancing requirements, and break-down buses, to demonstrate the system resiliency of the new routes and schedules via simulation. The new bus routes are implemented and used by all UM campuses during the academic year 2020-2021, to ensure social distancing and short travel time. Our approach can be generalized to redesign public transit systems with social distancing requirement during the pandemic to reduce passengers' infection risk.","Chen, Gongyu; Fei, Xinyu; Jia, Huiwen; Yu, Xian; Shen, Siqian",,255,6

IVDs play a central role in the diagnosis of individuals, in the rationale use of medicines, in burden of disease estimates, as well as in public health surveillance; especially for detection of emerging epidemics, the identification and monitoring of antimicrobial resistance, and the documentation of infection rates in populations. This article examines how the state of (a) product quality, (b) pricing, and (c) development country manufacturing capacity, are affecting the supply of IVDs in Low-Income Countries (LICs). Data informing this work is derived from interviews with representatives of leading stakeholder organisations working in this space, and analysis of secondary literature. The findings of this analysis are that the supply of IVDs in LICs is undermined by (i) significant variation in product quality; (ii) inconsistent market demand from governments; (iii) limited opportunities for pooled procurement; (iv) a lack of transparency and consistency in product pricing; and (v) insufficient competition among producers capable of innovating for populations with limited purchasing power and low-resource settings. The article then examines four strategies for how these challenges can be overcome.","Stevenson, Michael",Glob Public Health,255,16

We document that firms that are more resilient to social distancing significantly outperformed those with lower resilience during the COVID-19 outbreak, even after controlling for the standard risk factors. Similar cross-sectional return differentials already emerged before the COVID-19 crisis: the 2014-19 cumulative return differential between more and less resilient firms is of similar size as during the outbreak, suggesting growing awareness of pandemic risk well in advance of its materialization. Finally, we use stock option prices to infer the market's return expectations after the onset of the pandemic: even at a two-year horizon, stocks of more pandemic-resilient firms are expected to yield significantly lower returns than less resilient ones, reflecting their lower exposure to disaster risk. Hence, going forward, markets appear to price exposure to a new risk factor, namely, pandemic risk.","Pagano, Marco; Wagner, Christian; Zechner, Josef",,255,30

The systematic search was conducted in Google Scholar, Science Direct, PsycINFO, and PubMed in October of 2020, to determine the current evidence and observations concerning the Internet-based addictive behaviors amid COVID-19. Studies were included if they considered the Internet-based addictive behaviors during the current pandemic. We used all the names of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2 previously 2019 nCoV), the name of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and common Internet-based addictive behaviors, namely Internet addiction, online gaming disorder, online gambling disorder, pornography use, and smartphone use disorder.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious disease, and its first outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China. A coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes severe respiratory distress (ARDS). Due to the primary involvement of the respiratory system, chest CT is strongly recommended in suspected COVID-19 cases, for both initial evaluation and follow-up. Objective. The aim of this review was to systematically analyze the existing literature on CT imaging features of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods. A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Open Access Journals (OAJ), and Google Scholar databases until April 15, 2020. All articles with a report of CT findings in COVID-19 patients published in English from the onset of COVID-19 outbreak to April 20, 2020, were included in the study. Result. From a total of 5041 COVID-19-infected patients, about 98% (4940/5041) had abnormalities in chest CT, while about 2% have normal chest CT findings. Among COVID-19 patients with abnormal chest CT findings, 80% (3952/4940) had bilateral lung involvement. Ground-glass opacity (GGO) and mixed GGO with consolidation were observed in 2482 (65%) and 768 (18%) patients, respectively. Consolidations were detected in 1259 (22%) patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. CT images also showed interlobular septal thickening in about 691 (27%) patients. Conclusion. Frequent involvement of bilateral lung infections, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, crazy paving pattern, air bronchogram signs, and intralobular septal thickening were common CT imaging features of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Awulachew, Ephrem; Diriba, Kuma; Anja, Asrat; Getu, Eyob; Belayneh, Firehiwot",Radiol.

This study was done to evaluate the preventive practices being followed by health care workers and identify reasons for suboptimal compliance. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was done in HCWs belonging to various occupational roles and socio-cultural backgrounds across India through online platforms and telephonic interviews from July 30, 2020 to August 30, 2020. A scientifically designed and pre-validated questionnaire with good validity (CVR = 0.87, S-CVI/Av = 0.978) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.85) was used. RESULTS: The responses of 956 participants were analysed. Various suboptimal practices like touching outer surface of masks, lack of social distancing in cafeteria and duty rooms, inability to wash hands for adequate duration and properly follow steps of hand hygiene, inability to don and doff PPE properly, carrying PPE to duty rooms before completely doffing, use of personal mobile phones during duty and improper sleep were identified. Lack of knowledge, long duty hours, shortage of PPE, high patient workload, and casual attitude regarding own safety were identified as important barriers. Resident doctors and paramedical staff in the age group 18-30 years reported lower adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Suboptimal compliance in preventive practices like handling PPE, distancing in cafeteria/duty rooms and hand hygiene is not uncommon in HCWs. Certain barriers are identified which should be addressed to ensure adequate safety of HCWs against COVID-19.","Agarwal, Ayush; Ranjan, Piyush; Saraswat, Arjun; Kasi, Keerthana; Bharadiya, Vishwesh; Vikram, Naval; Singh, Amandeep; Upadhyay, Ashish Datt; Baitha, Upendra; Klanidhi, Kamal Bandhu; Chakrawarty, Avinash",Diabetes Metab Syndr,255,16

This is evident from the varied contributors within this Handbook. Increased popularity, of course, does not mean increased acceptance. This handbook explores new agendas in ethnographic research in healthcare. The chapters highlight that qualitative methods are both exploratory and produce outcomes which are generalizable and of high value for patients, doctors, nurses, and all professionals within healthcare. The handbook provides an up-to-date reference point for ethnography in healthcare research. Taking a multi-disciplinary approach, the chapters offer a holistic view of ethnography within medical contexts. This edited volume is organized around major methodological themes, such as ethics, interviews, narrative analysis, and mixed methods. Through the use of case studies, it illustrates how methodological considerations for ethnographic healthcare research are distinct from those in other fields. The book details content on the methodological facets of undertaking ethnography for prospective researchers to help them to conduct research in both an ethical and safe manner. It highlights important issues such as the role of the researcher as the key research instrument, exploring how one's social behaviours enable the researcher to 'get closer' to his/her participants and thus uncover original phenomena. Furthermore, it invites critical discussion of applied methodological strategies within the global academic community by pushing forward the use of ethnography to enhance the body of knowledge in the field. The book offers an original guide for advanced students, prospective ethnographers, and healthcare professionals aiming to utilize this methodological approach.

Since then, to prevent its propagation, the Moroccan government declared a state of health emergency. A set of rapid and strict countermeasures have taken, including locking down cities, limiting population's mobility and prohibiting almost all avoidable activities. In the present study, we attempted to evaluate the changes in levels of some air pollutants (mainly PM10, NO2 and SO2) in Salé city (North-Western Morocco) during the lockdown measures. In this context, a continuous measurement of PM10, SO2 and NO2 was carried before and during the Covid-19 lockdown period. As a consequence of the security measures and control actions undertaken, the emissions from vehicle exhaust and industrial production were significantly reduced, which contribute to the decrease in the concentrations of the studied pollutants. The obtained results showed that the difference between the concentrations recorded before and during the lockdown period were respectively 75%, 49% and 96% for PM10, SO2 and NO2. PM10 levels were much less reduced than NO2. The three-dimensional air mass backward trajectories, using the HYSPLIT model, demonstrated the benefits of PM10 local emission reductions related to the lockdown were overwhelmed by the contribution of long-range transported aerosols outside areas. In addition, noteworthy differences in the air mass back trajectories and the meteorology between these two periods were evidenced.","Otmani, Anas; Benchrif, Abdelfettah; Tahri, Mounia; Bounakhla, Moussa; Chakir, El Mahjoub; El Bouch, Mohammed; Krombi, M039; hamed,",Sci Total Environ,255,26

[...]the book explores the relationship between democratic politics and challenges to neoliberal capitalism. The protests were unprecedented in scale and intensity, and for half a year the world watched as Hong Kong citizens fought increasingly militarized police with Molotov cocktails, homemade bows and arrows, and as ever, umbrella shields.

Despite the promise of decades of lab-on-a-chip research, no commercial products were available to deliver rapid results or enable testing in the field at the onset of the pandemic. In this critical review, we assess the current state of progress on the development of point-of-care technologies for the diagnosis of viral diseases that cause pandemics. While many previous reviews have reported on progress in various lab-on-a-chip technologies, here we address the literature from the perspective of the testing needs of a rapidly expanding pandemic. First, we recommend a set of requirements to heed when designing point-of-care diagnostic technologies to address the testing needs of a pandemic. We then review the current state of assay technologies with a focus on isothermal amplification and lateral-flow immunoassays. Though there is much progress on assay development, we argue that the largest roadblock to deployment exists in sample preparation. We summarize current approaches to automate sample preparation and discuss both the progress and shortcomings of these developments. Finally, we provide our recommendations to the field of specific challenges to address in order to prepare for the next pandemic.","Everitt, Micaela L; Tillery, Alana; David, Martha G; Singh, Nikita; Borison, Aviva; White, Ian M",Anal Chim Acta,255,16

Multiple vowel acoustic metrics, including F1 range, F2 range, vowel space area (VSA), vowel articulation index (VAI) and formant centralization ratio (FCR), were analyzed from vowel tokens embedded in connected speech produced. The participants included 25 clients with spastic dysarthria secondary to stroke (15 males, 10 females) and 25 speakers with no history of neurological disease (15 males, 10 females). Variance analyses were conducted and the results showed that the main effects of population, gender, and tone on F2 range, VSA, VAI, and FCR were all significant. Vowel production became centralized in the clients with post-stroke spastic dysarthria. Vowel production was found to be more centralized in males compared to females. Vowels in neutral tone (T0) were the most centralized among the other tones. The quantitative acoustic metrics of F2 range, VSA, VAI, and FCR were effective in predicting vowel production in Mandarin-speaking clients with post-stroke spastic dysarthria, and hence may be used as powerful tools to assess the speech performance for this population.","Ge, Shengnan; Wan, Qin; Yin, Minmin; Wang, Yongli; Huang, Zhaoming",Clin Linguist Phon,255,16

The molecular mechanism of virus infection and spread in the body is not yet disclosed, but studies on other betacoronaviruses show that, upon cell infection, these viruses inhibit macroautophagy/autophagy flux and cause the accumulation of autophagosomes. No drug has yet been approved for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, preclinical investigations suggested repurposing of several FDA-approved drugs for clinical trials. Half of these drugs are modulators of the autophagy pathway. Unexpectedly, instead of acting by directly antagonizing the effects of viruses, these drugs appear to function by suppressing autophagy flux. Based on the established cross-talk between autophagy and apoptosis, we speculate that over-accumulation of autophagosomes activates an apoptotic pathway that results in apoptotic death of the infected cells and disrupts the virus replication cycle. However, administration of the suggested drugs are associated with severe adverse effects due to their off-target accumulation. Nanoparticle targeting of autophagy at the sites of interest could be a powerful tool to efficiently overcome SARS-CoV-2 infection while avoiding the common adverse effects of these drugs.","Shojaei, Shahla; Suresh, Madhumita; Klionsky, Daniel J; Labouta, Hagar Ibrahim; Ghavami, Saeid",Virulence,255,22

The survey collected demographic data and questions regarding participants' working position since pandemic outbreak. PARTICIPANTS: Spanish healthcare workers working on the FL or usual ward were eligible. A total of 674 healthcare professionals answered the survey. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Burn-out syndrome was assessed by the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Medical Personnel. RESULTS: Of the 643 eligible responding participants, 408 (63.5%) were physicians, 172 (26.8%) were nurses and 63 (9.8%) other technical occupations. 377 (58.6%) worked on the FL. Most participants were women (472 (73.4%)), aged 31-40 years (163 (25.3%)) and worked in tertiary hospitals (>600 beds) (260 (40.4%)). Prevalence of burn-out syndrome was 43.4% (95% CI 39.5% to 47.2%), higher in COVID-19 FL workers (49.6%, p<0.001) than in non- COVID-19 FL workers (34.6%, p<0.001).

The scale showed adequate internal reliability (&#945; = .87; &#969; = .92) and concurrent validity, as indicated by significantly positive correlations with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; anxiety, r = .56; depression, r = .29) and Perceived Vulnerability to Disease (PVD; perceived infectability, r = .32; germ aversion, r = .29). Additionally, the FCV-19S not only directly increased all coping behaviors (ß = .21 - .36); it also indirectly increased stockpiling through conformity reason (indirect effect, ß = .04; total effect, ß = .31). These results suggest that the Japanese FCV-19S psychometric scale has equal reliability and validity to those of the original FCV-19S. These findings will contribute further to the investigation of various difficulties arising from fear about COVID-19 in Japan.","Wakashima, Koubun; Asai, Keigo; Kobayashi, Daisuke; Koiwa, Kohei; Kamoshida, Saeko; Sakuraba, Mayumi",PLoS One,255,2

We aimed to evaluate antihypertensive medications and COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality, accounting for healthcare-seeking behaviour. METHODS: A population-based case-control study was conducted including 16 866 COVID-19 cases and 70 137 matched controls from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We evaluated all-cause mortality among COVID-19 cases. Exposures were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers (B), calcium-channel blockers (C), thiazide diuretics (D) and other antihypertensive drugs (O). Analyses were adjusted for covariates and consultation frequency. RESULTS: ACEIs were associated with lower odds of COVID-19 diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-0.88) as were ARBs (AOR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.95) with little attenuation from adjustment for consultation frequency. C and D were also associated with lower odds of COVID-19 diagnosis. Increased odds of COVID-19 for B (AOR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.26) were attenuated after adjustment for consultation frequency (AOR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95-1.08). Patients treated with ACEIs or ARBs had similar odds of mortality (AOR 1.00, 95% CI 0.83-1.20) to patients treated with classes B, C, D or O or patients receiving no antihypertensive therapy (AOR 0.99, 95% CI 0.83-1.18). CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that antihypertensive therapy is associated with increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis or mortality; most classes of antihypertensive therapy showed negative associations with COVID-19 diagnosis.","Rezel-Potts, Emma; Douiri, Abdel; Chowienczyk, Phil J; Gulliford, Martin C",,255,20

METHODS: We performed a recollection of all the clinical and laboratory data of patients having acute neurological symptoms temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection at a third-level referral hospital in Mexico City (Instituto Nacional de Pediatría). Patients in an age group of 0-17 years with acute neurological signs (including ascending weakness with areflexia, diminished visual acuity, encephalopathy, ataxia, stroke, or weakness with plasma creatinine kinase (CK) elevation) were evaluated. RESULTS: Out of 23 patients with neurological manifestations, 10 (43%) had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the infected patients, 5 (50%) were males aged 2-16 years old (median age 11.8 years old). Four (40%) patients confirmed a close contact with a relative positive for SARS-CoV-2, while 6 (60%) cases had a history of SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms over the previous 2 weeks. The following diagnoses were established: 3 cases of GBS, 2 of ON, 2 of AIS, one of myositis with rhabdomyolysis, one ACA, and one of anti-NMDA-R encephalitis. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological manifestations temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were noticed in the pediatric population even without respiratory symptoms. In this study, 2 of 6 symptomatic patients had mild respiratory symptoms and 4 had unspecific symptoms. During this pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infection should be considered as etiology in patients with acute neurological symptoms, with or without previous respiratory manifestations, particularly in teenagers.","Sánchez-Morales, Areli Estela; Urrutia-Osorio, Marta; Camacho-Mendoza, Esteban; Rosales-Pedraza, Gustavo; Dávila-Maldonado, Luis; González-Duarte, Alejandra; Herrera-Mora, Patricia; Ruiz-García, Matilde",Childs Nerv Syst,255,20

DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study. METHODS: Setting and participants: all patients undergoing anterior segment surgery at an ambulatory surgical center (ASC) belonging to a tertiary academic center in South Florida during a 102-day period between June and September 2020 received nasal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 and underwent a relevant review of symptoms prior to surgery, with negative results required for both in order to proceed with surgery. Main outcomes and measurements: a small sample of aqueous humor (approximately 0.2 cc) was acquired at the beginning of anterior segment surgery from all participants. Aqueous humor was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Demographic information was acquired from participants for secondary analyses. RESULTS: A total of 70 samples were acquired. Of those, 39 samples were excluded due to insufficient material or inconclusive results. Of 31 samples that were successfully analyzed, 6 (19.4%) demonstrated detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA. None of the 6 individuals (0%) with detectable viral RNA in aqueous humor reported symptoms during the year, compared to 2 of 25 individuals (8%) with negative samples (P = 1). Positive samples were distributed throughout the study period, including both the first and the last days of enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in aqueous despite negative nasal swab testing confirmed its presence beyond the blood-ocular barrier in asymptomatic individuals and raises the possibility that the virus may persist in immunoprivileged spaces despite an absence of symptoms.","Koo, Ellen H; Eghrari, Allen O; Dzhaber, Daliya; Shah, Amar; Fout, Elizabeth; Dubovy, Sander; Maestre-Mesa, Jorge; Miller, Darlene",Am J Ophthalmol,255,16

This research examined the influence dark personality traits on attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine rules. We determined whether specific dark traits could predict non-compliance, beyond the global measure of dark personality traits. Additionally, previous research suggests that people are more likely to violate rules for the benefits of close relations, rather than for their own self-interests. We examined how this tendency interacts with dark traits. The 823 participants in the study completed measures of the dark triad, moral disengagement, and attitudes toward COVID-19 rules, and responded to vignettes about themselves or close relations escaping quarantine. Using a bifactor model approach, results showed that a general dark factor predicted non-compliance to COVID-19 rules, but that some moral disengagement mechanisms contributed to non-compliance beyond this factor. Vignette results showed that participants were more willing to break quarantine rules for a close relation than for themselves, except for those high in moral disengagement, who broke rules more-regardless of who was involved. These findings have important implications for intervention programs and policies, since individuals with dark traits tend to ""selfishly"" trespass norms, but anyone can ""go beyond the pale, i.e., go outside the limits of acceptable behavior, for a loved one.","Espinosa, Pablo; Clemente, Miguel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),255,14

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of nurses in four different regions in Italy between 20 and 28 December 2020 to obtain data on the acceptance of the upcoming COVID-19 vaccination in order to plan specific interventions to increase the rate of vaccine coverage. Results: A total of 531 out of the 5000 nurses invited completed the online questionnaire. Most of the nurses enrolled in the study (73.4%) were female. Among the nurses, 91.5% intended to accept vaccination, whereas 2.3% were opposed and 6.2% were undecided. Female sex and confidence in vaccine efficacy represent the main predictors of vaccine intention among the study population using a logistic regression model, while other factors including vaccine safety concerns (side effects) were non-significant. Conclusions: Despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, intention to be vaccinated was suboptimal among nurses in our sample. We also found a significant number of people undecided as to whether to accept the vaccine. Contrary to expectations, concerns about the safety of the vaccine were not found to affect the acceptance rate;nurses’ perception of vaccine efficacy and female sex were the main influencing factors on attitudes toward vaccination in our sample. Since the success of the COVID-19 immunization plan depends on the uptake rate, these findings are of great interest for public health policies. Interventions aimed at increasing employee awareness of vaccination efficacy should be promoted among nurses in order to increase the number of vaccinated people.","Trabucco Aurilio, Marco Mennini Francesco Saverio Gazzillo Simone Massini Laura Bolcato Matteo Feola Alessandro Ferrari Cristiana Coppeta Luca",Vaccines,255,16

METHODS: Thirty-nine patients admitted to the study hospital with confirmed COVID-19 who experienced various skin manifestations during hospitalization or in the convalescence period, were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients with COVID-19, admitted to the study hospital between 23 March and 12 September 2020, had intra-infectious rash or lesions of cutaneous vasculitis during convalescence. The most common cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 were erythematous and erythematous papular rash. Twenty-seven of the 39 patients had anosmia (69.2%), 26 patients had ageusia (66.7%), 34 patients had pneumonia (87.2%) and 24 patients had intra-infectious enterocolitis (61.5%). Skin biopsies were rarely performed in these patients. This article reports the results of biopsies performed in two patients, showing histopathological and immunohistochemical changes in erythematous rash and erythema multiforme-like lesions. Both skin biopsies revealed early fibrous remodelling of the dermis, suggesting similarity with changes that occur in the lungs and other tissues in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Correlations between skin lesions and anosmia, ageusia and enteritis in patients with COVID-19 do not seem to be accidental, but are associated with a similar response to ACE2 receptor expression in these tissues.","Birlutiu, Victoria; Feiereisz, Alin Iulian; Oprinca, George; Dobritoiu, Simona; Rotaru, Maria; Birlutiu, Rares Mircea; Iancu, Gabriela Mariana",Int J Infect Dis,255,20

Although state-wide stay-at-home orders in the United States received a large degree of media and political attention, relatively little peer-reviewed research has examined the impacts of such orders social distancing behaviors. METHOD: This study used daily GPS-derived movement from 2,858 counties in the United States from March 1 to May 7, 2020 to test the degree to which changes in state-level stay-at-home orders were associated with movement outside the home. RESULTS: From early March to early April, people in counties with state-level stay-at-home orders decreased their movement significantly more than counties without state-level stay-at-home orders; 3.1% more people stayed within 1 mile of home and 1.6% fewer vehicle miles were driven per day. From early April to early May, people in counties within states that ended their stay-at-home orders increased their movement significantly more than counties in states whose stay-at-home orders remained in place; 1.2% fewer people remained within 1 mile of home and 6.2% more vehicle miles were driven per day. The magnitude of changes associated with state-level stay-at-home orders were many times smaller than the total changes in movement across all counties over the same periods. CONCLUSIONS: Stay-at-home orders were associated with greater social distancing, but accounted for only part of this behavioral change. Research on behavior change would be useful to determine additional interventions that could support social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bourassa, Kyle J",Psychosom. med,255,9

As other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is enveloped, replicates in the cytoplasm and assembles at intracellular membranes. Here, we structurally characterize the viral replication compartment and report critical insights into the budding mechanism of the virus, and the structure of extracellular virions close to their native state by in situ cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging. We directly visualize RNA filaments inside the double membrane vesicles, compartments associated with viral replication. The RNA filaments show a diameter consistent with double-stranded RNA and frequent branching likely representing RNA secondary structures. We report that assembled S trimers in lumenal cisternae do not alone induce membrane bending but laterally reorganize on the envelope during virion assembly. The viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) are accumulated at the curved membrane characteristic for budding sites suggesting that vRNP recruitment is enhanced by membrane curvature. Subtomogram averaging shows that vRNPs are distinct cylindrical assemblies. We propose that the genome is packaged around multiple separate vRNP complexes, thereby allowing incorporation of the unusually large coronavirus genome into the virion while maintaining high steric flexibility between the vRNPs.","Klein, Steffen; Cortese, Mirko; Winter, Sophie L; Wachsmuth-Melm, Moritz; Neufeldt, Christopher J; Cerikan, Berati; Stanifer, Megan L; Boulant, Steeve; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Chlanda, Petr",Nat Commun,255,1

The appropriate use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) has been essential to ensuring staff and patient safety. To counteract sub-optimal PPE practice, a PPE helper programme was developed at a large London hospital group. Based on a behaviour change model of Capability, Opportunity and Motivation (COM-B), the programme provided PPE support, advice and education to ward staff. AIM: Evaluation of the PPE Helper Programme. METHODS: Clinical and non-clinical ward staff completed a questionnaire informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework and COM-B. The questionnaire was available in paper and electronic versions. Quantitative responses were analysed using descriptive and non-parametric statistics, free-text responses were analysed thematically. FINDINGS: Over a six-week period, PPE helpers made 268 ward visits. Overall, 261 questionnaires were available for analysis. Across the Trust, 68% of respondents reported having had contact with a PPE helper. Staff who had encountered a PPE helper responded significantly more positively to a range of statements about using PPE than those who had not. Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) staff were significantly more anxious in relation to the adequacy of PPE. Non-clinical and redeployed staff (e.g. domestic staff) were most positive about the impact of PPE helpers. Free-text comments showed that staff found the programme supportive and would have liked it earlier in the pandemic. CONCLUSION: A PPE Helper programme is a feasible and beneficial intervention for providing support, advice and education to ward staff during infectious disease outbreaks.","Castro-Sánchez, E; Cm, Alexander; C, Atchison; D, Patel; W, Leung; Me, Calamita; Garcia D, Meno; C, Cimpeanu; Jm, Mumbwatasai; D, Ramid; K, Doherty; Hs, Grewal; Ja, Otter; M, Wells",J. hosp. infect,255,16

The research for registration purposes gives us snapshots, thanks to which the new drugs arrive on the market. What is before the photo is not necessarily clear; for example, the characteristics of the patient population, which often differ between the trial and clinical practice that could begin years later. As it is not clear what there is after the photo; for example, the subsequent treatments which also change over time. Indeed, the time frame following the photo is often deliberately obscured by using surrogate endpoints that overestimate advantages. Regulatory agencies are called upon to decide on registration and reimbursement despite being essentially unable to fully understand the value, positioning and economic consequences of new drugs.

In this study we aimed to evaluate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of siRNA both in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: To identify the most effective molecule out of a panel of 15 in silico designed siRNAs, an in vitro screening system based on vectors expressing SARS-CoV-2 genes fused with the firefly luciferase reporter gene and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells was used. The most potent siRNA, siR-7, was modified by Locked nucleic acids (LNAs) to obtain siR-7-EM with increased stability and was formulated with the peptide dendrimer KK-46 for enhancing cellular uptake to allow topical application by inhalation of the final formulation - siR-7-EM/KK-46. Using the Syrian Hamster model for SARS-CoV-2 infection the antiviral capacity of siR-7-EM/KK-46 complex was evaluated. RESULTS: We identified the siRNA, siR-7, targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) as the most efficient siRNA inhibiting viral replication in vitro. Moreover, we showed that LNA-modification and complexation with the designed peptide dendrimer enhanced the antiviral capacity of siR-7 in vitro. We demonstrated significant reduction of virus titer and lung inflammation in animals exposed to inhalation of siR-7-EM/KK-46 in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we developed a therapeutic strategy for COVID-19 based on inhalation of a modified siRNA-peptide dendrimer formulation. The developed medication is intended for inhalation treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Khaitov, Musa; Nikonova, Alexandra; Shilovskiy, Igor; Kozhikhova, Ksenia; Kofiadi, Ilya; Vishnyakova, Lyudmila; Nikolskii, Alexander; Gattinger, Pia; Kovchina, Valeria; Barvinskaia, Ekaterina; Yumashev, Kirill; Smirnov, Valeriy; Maerle, Artem; Kozlov, Ivan; Shatilov, Artem; Timofeeva, Anastasiia; Andreev, Sergey; Koloskova, Olesya; Kuznetsova, Nadezhda; Vasina, Daria; Nikiforova, Maria; Rybalkin, Sergei; Sergeev, Ilya; Trofimov, Dmitriy; Martynov, Alexander; Berzin, Igor; Gushchin, Vladimir; Kovalchuk, Aleksey; Borisevich, Sergei; Valenta, Rudolf; Khaitov, Rakhim; Skvortsova, Veronica",Allergy,255,10

It is also in part an introductory review to relevant computational techniques for tackling viral threats, using COVID-19 as an example. Q-UEL tools for facilitating access to knowledge and bioinformatics tools were again used for efficiency, but the focus in this paper is even more on the virus. Subsequence KRSFIEDLLFNKV of the S2' spike glycoprotein proteolytic cleavage site continues to appear important. Here it is shown to be recognizable in the common cold coronaviruses, avian coronaviruses and possibly as traces in the nidoviruses of reptiles and fish. Its function or functions thus seem important to the coronaviruses. It might represent SARS-CoV-2 Achilles' heel, less likely to acquire resistance by mutation, as has happened in some early SARS vaccine studies discussed in the previous paper. Preliminary conformational analysis of the receptor (ACE2) binding site of the spike protein is carried out suggesting that while it is somewhat conserved, it appears to be more variable than KRSFIEDLLFNKV. However compounds like emodin that inhibit SARS entry, apparently by binding ACE2, might also have functions at several different human protein binding sites. The enzyme 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 is again argued to be a convenient model pharmacophore perhaps representing an ensemble of targets, and it is noted that it occurs both in lung and alimentary tract. Perhaps it benefits the virus to block an inflammatory response by inhibiting the dehydrogenase, but a fairly complex web involves several possible targets.","Robson, B",Comput Biol Med,255,24

It is infecting respiratory organs and, in more severe cases, the lungs, where it is infecting the human cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. In severe cases, it is characterized not only by difficulties in breathing through infected lungs, but also with disproportionally and, thus far, unexplained low levels of oxygen in the blood. Here, we propose that, besides the infection of respiratory organs through ACE2 receptors, there is an additional infection in the red blood cells (erythrocytes). There could be a possible for SARS-CoV-2 to pass through the alveoli membrane in the lungs and infect the red blood cells through another receptor. Using our own biophysical model, the Resonant Recognition Model, we propose that the red blood cell (RBC) Band3 protein on the surface of red blood cells is a possible entry point for the SARS-CoV-2 virus into red blood cells.","Cosic, Irena; Cosic, Drasko; Loncarevic, Ivan",Appl.

Yet there is scant quantitative evidence on the prevalence and geographic distribution of ISPs in the United States. To fill this gap, we construct a comprehensive, nationwide database of 2,138 geocoded ISP offices that offer low- or no-cost legal services to low-income immigrants. We use spatial optimization methods to analyze the geographic network of ISPs and measure ISPs' proximity to the low-income immigrant population. Because both ISPs and immigrants are highly concentrated in major urban areas, most low-income immigrants live close to an ISP. However, we also find a sizable fraction of low-income immigrants in underserved areas, which are primarily in midsize cities in the South. This reflects both a general skew in non-governmental organization service provision and the more recent arrival of immigrants in these largely Southern destinations. Finally, our optimization analysis suggests significant gains from placing new ISPs in underserved areas to maximize the number of low-income immigrants who live near an ISP. Overall, our results provide vital information to immigrants, funders, and policymakers about the current state of the ISP network and opportunities to improve it.","Yasenov, Vasil; Hausman, David; Hotard, Michael; Lawrence, Duncan; Siegel, Alexandra; Wolff, Jessica S.; Laitin, David D.; Hainmueller, Jens",,255,26

People are generally susceptible to COVID-19 because people lack immunity to this new virus. With the spread of this epidemic disease from Wuhan, a national outbreak soon appeared, and now many countries have this disease. Unfortunately, no effective drug for COVID-19 treatment has been found so far. METHODS: We designed a retrospective study based on patients admitted to The Affiliated Infectious Hospital of Soochow University from January 22, 2020, to February 25, 2020, with diagnosed COVID-19. We analyzed correlations between RT-PCR negative time and laboratory indicators, then divided all cases into 2 groups according to oxygenation index, data of RT-PCR negative time and related laboratory indicators of the two groups were com-pared. RESULTS: We collected 84 confirmed patients whose RT-PCR had turned negative, including 23 patients with the lowest oxygenation index &#8804; 300 mmHg and 61 patients had > 300 mmHg. There was a positive correlation between the RT-PCR negative time and age, WBC count, LDH, SCr. There were statistically significant differences in fever numbers, WBC count, lymphocyte count, CRP, ALT, AST, albumin, LDH, SCr, D-dimer, and fibrinogen between the two groups based on the oxygenation index. CONCLUSIONS: Age, WBC count, LDH, and SCr may be related to the duration of COVID-19 disease.

291793,291793,291793,Alcohol consumption and obesity: The hidden scare with COVID-19 severity,16.047472,7.099617,2020,"Rationale: During the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been significant uncertainty and heightened fear regarding the poor prognosis of COVID-19 and the disproportionate impact on minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Prior studies have demonstrated that baseline characteristics including older age, white race, female gender, and poor functional status are all associated with the decision to forego resuscitative efforts during critical illness. We sought to understand if demographic characteristics are stronger predictors for the decision to forgo resuscitative efforts than comorbid condition or severity of critical illness during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on all adults admitted to Boston Medical Center (BMC) ICU between March 1 and June 7 with confirmed Covid-19 infection. Patients were dichotomized into two groups: patients with code status conversion to DNAR and patients that remained full code during the entirety of their critical illness. Univariate analysis and logistic regression was performed to identify variables associated with code status conversion. Results: A total of 281 patients were hospitalized in the ICU with COVID-19 infection and 70% (n = 198) remained full code while 29.5% (n = 83) instituted DNAR orders. Older age was associated with decision to institute DNAR order (65 years-old SD±15 v 58 years-old SD±15, p &lt; 0.001). The other demographic factors including gender, race, language preference, and insurance status were not associated with decision to institute DNAR order. The comorbid conditions of cardiopulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, or malignancy were not associated with decision to institute DNAR. The intra-critical illness factors including need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (OR 5.2 95% CI 2.6-11.2), need for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (OR 3.8 95% CI 1.8-8) and admission SOFA score (5 SD ± 3.5 v 7 SD ± 4, p &lt; 0.001) were associated with decision to institute DNAR order. Conclusion: This preliminary study suggests that at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic and height of uncertainty, factors associated with the decision to forgo resuscitative efforts are primarily intra-critical illness factors as opposed to baseline demographic characteristics. A larger multi-center study is required to confirm the findings from a single-center safety net hospital.","Mesfin, N. M.; Han, A.; Garcia, M. A.; Johnson, S.

Unprecedented global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) resulted in restricted availability, as well as evolving guidance on use, the latter of which was complicated by conflicting guidance provided by numerous healthcare bodies. AIM: To assess perceived confidence and knowledge of PPE guidance as published by Public Health England (PHE) amongst doctors of varying specialties and grades. METHOD: A nationwide 11-point survey comprising of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and a 5-point Likert scale assessing perceived confidence was disseminated to UK-based doctors using multiple platforms. Statistical analysis using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey's honest significant difference (Tukey HSD) and Pearson's chi-squared test was undertaken to assess for statistical significance. RESULTS: Data collated from 697 respondents revealed that average perceived confidence was low across all specialties and grades. Notably, 59% (n = 411) felt they had received insufficient education regarding up-to-date guidance, with 81% (n = 565) advocating further training. Anaesthetics and ophthalmology were highest and lowest scoring specialties in knowledge-based MCQs, achieving scores of 59% and 31%, respectively. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between specialty, but not grade. CONCLUSION: Ensuring uniformity in published guidance, coupled with education may aid knowledge and subsequent confidence regarding the appropriate use of PPE. The absence of a unified consensus and sustained training not only poses significant ramifications for patient and healthcare professional (HCP) safety, but also risks further depletion of already sparse resources. Because of the novelty of COVID-19, appropriate PPE is continually evolving leaving an absence in formal training and education. This paper reveals insight into confidence and knowledge of PPE amongst doctors of various specialities/grades during a global pandemic, highlighting key deficits in education and training.","Al-Hity, Shams; Bhamra, Navdeep; Kumar, Ravi; Gupta, Keshav Kumar; Howard, James; Jolly, Karan; Darr, Adnan",Int J Clin Pract,255,21

In the COVID-19 situation, finding targets for drug repurposing can be an effective way to present new fast treatments. We have designed a two-step solution to address this approach. In the first step, we identify essential proteins from virus targets or their associated modules in human cells as possible drug target candidates. For this purpose, we apply two different algorithms to detect some candidate sets of proteins with a minimum size that drive a significant disruption in the COVID-19 related biological networks. We evaluate the resulted candidate proteins sets with three groups of drugs namely Covid-Drug, Clinical-Drug, and All-Drug. The obtained candidate proteins sets approve 16 drugs out of 18 in the Covid-Drug, 273 drugs out of 328 in the Clinical-Drug, and a large number of drugs in the All-Drug. In the second step, we study COVID-19 associated proteins sets and recognize proteins that are essential to disease pathology. This analysis is performed using DAVID to show and compare essential proteins that are contributed between the COVID-19 comorbidities. Our results for shared proteins show significant enrichment for cardiovascular-related, hypertension, diabetes type 2, kidney-related and lung-related diseases.","Habibi, Mahnaz; Taheri, Golnaz; Aghdam, Rosa",Sci Rep,255,30

To date, the application of digital technologies in response to COVID-19 pandemic has been narrowed to public-health needs related to containment and mitigation. However, information and communications technology (ICT)-based initiatives directed toward prediction and prevention of psychosocial support are still limited. Given the power of digital health solutions to allow easy and accurate characterization and intervention for health and disease, as well as to flatten the COVID19 incidence curves in many countries, our ECLB-COVID19 consortium is highlighting the importance of providing innovative ICT-based solutions (ICT-COVID-Companion) to improve elderly physical and mental health, thereby preventing/dampening psychosocial strain during pandemics. Based on innovative approaches (e.g., emotional/social computing, open social platform, interactive coaching, gamification, fitness-tracker, internet of things) and smart digital solutions (smartwatch/smartphone), smart companions must provide safe personalised physical, mental and psychosocial health surveillance. Additionally, by delivering personalised multi-dimension crisis-oriented health recommendations, such innovative crisis-oriented solutions would help (i) facilitate a user's adherence to active and healthy confinement lifestyle (AHCL), (ii) achieve a rapid psychosocial recovery in case of depression issues and (iii) enhance preparedness for eventual future pandemics.","Ammar, Achraf Bouaziz Bassem Trabelsi Khaled Glenn Jordan M.; Zmijewski, Piotr Müller Patrick Chtourou Hamdi Jmaiel Mohamed Chamari Karim Driss Tarak Hökelmann Anita",Biology of Sport,255,1

All restaurants need to reformat their business models, some restaurants are temporarily closed, and some restaurants offer takeaway and/or delivery services. The purposes of this study were twofold: to determine the relationship between restaurant service quality and revisit intention and to examine the moderating effect of trust on this relationship. This study examined how service quality in restaurants affects revisit intention during pandemic conditions. This study indicated that restaurant service quality influences customer trust. In the same way, customer trust has a positive effect on revisit intention. However, restaurant service quality does not directly affect on revisit intention.

In order to prevent the resurgence of the epidemic, the Chinese government has continued the use of effective prevention and control measures in key epidemic areas. New prevention and control measures have also been developed based on the characteristics of the epidemic and the social habits of the Chinese people. The strategies applied in China include large-scale nucleic acid testing, travel health code management, and patient treatment based on a combination of Chinese and Western medicine. These measures can provide a reference point for the global public health system that is facing the pandemic. The article suggests that to prevent a pandemic, we must not only rely on vaccines and drugs, but also need to take actions and apply social measures to manage the risk of infectious diseases.","Yu, X.; Li, N.; Dong, Y.",Risk Management &amp; Healthcare Policy,255,6

Sixteen percent of patients display reduced inflammation yet comparably poor outcomes. Comparison of patients who died to severely ill survivors identifies dynamic immune cell-derived and tissue-associated proteins associated with survival, including exocrine pancreatic proteases. Using derived tissue-specific and cell type-specific intracellular death signatures, cellular ACE2 expression, and our data, we infer whether organ damage resulted from direct or indirect effects of infection.

An objective and quantitative means of monitoring the impact and response of these interventions at a local level is urgently required. Here we explore the utility of the recently developed open-source mobile health platform RADAR-base as a toolbox to test the effect and response to NPIs aimed at limiting the spread of COVID-19. Methods We included 1062 participants recruited in Italy, Spain, Denmark, the UK, and the Netherlands. We derived features from the phone and wearable device for length of time spent at home, distance travelled from home, heart rate, sleep, and patterns of phone use. We visualised data using time series plots and performed statistical tests to assess differences in behaviour during baseline, pre-, and post-lockdown periods. Findings We found significant changes in behaviours between baseline/pre-lockdown and post-lockdown for all features except total sleep duration. In general, participants spent more time at home, travelled much less, and were more active on their phones, interacting with others by using social apps. Nevertheless, the response across nations differed with Denmark showing attenuated changes in behaviour. Interpretation Differences in the extracted features by country may reflect variations in communication and implementation of different NPIs as well as cultural differences. We have demonstrated that generalised open-source mobile health monitoring platforms such as RADAR-base which leverages data from wearables and mobile technologies are valuable tools for helping understand the behavioural impact of public health interventions implemented in response to infectious outbreaks such as COVID-19.","Sun, Shaoxiong; Folarin, Amos; Ranjan, Yatharth; Rashid, Zulqarnain; Conde, Pauline; Stewart, Callum; Cummins, Nicholas; Matcham, Faith; Costa, Gloria Dalla; Leocani, Letizia; Sorensen, Per Soelberg; Buron, Mathias; Guerrero, Ana Isabel; Zabalza, Ana; Penninx, Brenda WJH; Lamers, Femke; Siddi, Sara; Haro, Josep Maria; Myin-Germeys, Inez; Rintala, Aki; Narayan, Vaibhav A.; Comi, Giancarlo; Hotopf, Matthew; Dobson, Richard JB",,255,20

As a result, the general population has significantly decreased their physical activity levels. The consequences of this abrupt, sedentary lifestyle in Spanish people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS) were unknown. Our aim was to examine the impact of COVID-19 home confinement on neuromuscular performance, functional capacity, physical self-perception, and anxiety in pwMS. METHODS: Eighteen pwMS (8:10 men/women, age: 43.41±10.88 years, Expanded Disability Status Scale: 2.85±1.34) participated in the study. Rate of force development (RFD) and maximal voluntary isometric contraction during knee extension in both legs, Timed-Up and Go test (TUG), sit-to-stand test, 6 min walk test, 10 m walk test, Physical-Self Perception Questionnaire (PSPQ) and State-Train Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were performed just before and after home confinement. RESULTS: A non-significant moderate effect (p = 0.07; ES = -0.48) was observed in the time in the sit-to-stand test compared to pre-home confinement. There was a significant increase in the time in TUG (p = 0.02; ES = -0.67). The PSQP score decreased (p = 0.01; ES = 0.79) and STAI-state increased (p = 0.01; ES = -0.65) following home confinement. CONCLUSION: Home confinement had an impact on functional capacity, physical self-perception and state anxiety. However, neuromuscular performance was not altered after home confinement.","Andreu-Caravaca, Luis; Ramos-Campo, Domingo J; Chung, Linda H; Manonelles, Pedro; Abellán-Aynés, Oriol; Rubio-Arias, Jacobo Á",Mult Scler Relat Disord,255,24

Considering the importance of the ongoing coronavirus crisis, we decided to evaluate genomes of all coronaviruses sequenced to date (stated more broadly, the order Nidovirales) to determine if they contain non-canonical nucleic acid structures. We discovered much evidence of putative G-quadruplex sites and even much more of inverted repeats (IRs) loci, which in fact are ubiquitous along the whole genomic sequence and indicate a possible mechanism for genomic RNA packaging. The most notable enrichment of IRs was found inside 5′UTR for IRs of size 12+ nucleotides, and the most notable enrichment of putative quadruplex sites (PQSs) was located before 3′UTR, inside 5′UTR, and before mRNA. This indicates crucial regulatory roles for both IRs and PQSs. Moreover, we found multiple G-quadruplex binding motifs in human proteins having potential for binding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Non-canonical nucleic acids structures in Nidovirales and in novel SARS-CoV-2 are therefore promising druggable structures that can be targeted and utilized in the future.","Bartas, Martin; Brázda, Václav; Bohálová, Natália; Cantara, Alessio; Volná, Adriana; Stachurová, Tereza; Malachová, Kateřina; Jagelská, Eva B.; Porubiaková, Otília; Červeň, Jiří; Pečinka, Petr",Front.

We simulate the effect of different lengths of FG or the zero interest rate policy under the circumstance of the global liquidity trap. We show that the size of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution plays an important role in determining the beggar-thy-neighbor effect or the prosper-thy-neighbor effect of home FG policy on the foreign economy. And in the former case, by targeting a minimum welfare loss of the individual country alone but not global welfare loss, two central banks can perform interesting FG bargaining in which they cooperatively adopt the same length of FG or strategically deviate from cooperation.","Ida, Daisuke; Iiboshi, Hirokuni",,255,23

CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and neutralizing antibodies all contribute to control SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, heterogeneity is a major factor in disease severity and in immune innate and adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2. We performed a deep analysis by flow cytometry of lymphocyte populations of 125 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected patients on the day of hospital admission. Five clusters of patients were identified using hierarchical classification on the basis of their immunophenotypic profile, with different mortality outcomes. Some characteristics were observed in all the clusters of patients, such as lymphopenia and an elevated level of effector CD8+CCR7- T cells. However, low levels of T cell activation are associated to a better disease outcome; on the other hand, profound CD8+ T-cell lymphopenia, a high level of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activation and a high level of CD8+ T-cell senescence are associated with a higher mortality outcome. Furthermore, a cluster of patient was characterized by high B-cell responses with an extremely high level of plasmablasts. Our study points out the prognostic value of lymphocyte parameters such as T-cell activation and senescence and strengthen the interest in treating the patients early in course of the disease with targeted immunomodulatory therapies based on the type of adaptive response of each patient.","Clavarino, Giovanna; Leroy, Corentin; Epaulard, Olivier; Raskovalova, Tatiana; Vilotitch, Antoine; Pernollet, Martine; Dumestre-Perard, Chantal; Defendi, Federica; Marechal, Marion Le; Gouellec, Audrey Le; Audoin, Pierre; Bosson, Jean-Luc; Poignard, Pascal; Roustit, Matthieu; Jacob, Marie-Christine; Cesbron, Jean-Yves",,255,6

Data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients were retrieved from electronic medical record. Supervised k-means clustering of serial C-reactive protein levels (CRP), absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), and absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) was used to assign immune responses to one of three groups. Then, relationships between patterns of inflammatory responses and clinical course and outcome of COVID-19 were assessed in a discovery and validation cohort. Unbiased clustering analysis grouped 105 patients of a discovery cohort into three distinct clusters. Cluster 1 (hyper-inflammatory immune response) was characterized by high CRP levels, high ANC, and low ALC, whereas Cluster 3 (hypo-inflammatory immune response) was associated with low CRP levels and normal ANC and ALC. Cluster 2 showed an intermediate pattern. All patients in Cluster 1 required oxygen support whilst 61% patients in Cluster 2 and no patient in Cluster 3 required supplementary oxygen. Two (13.3%) patients in Cluster 1 died, whereas no patient in Clusters 2 and 3 died. The results were confirmed in an independent validation cohort of 116 patients. We identified three different patterns of inflammatory immune response to COVID-19. Hyper-inflammatory immune responses with elevated CRP, neutrophilia, and lymphopenia are associated with a severe disease and a worse outcome. Therefore, targeting the hyper-inflammatory response might improve the clinical outcome of COVID-19.","Lee, Eunyoung Emily; Song, Kyoung-Ho; Hwang, Woochang; Ham, Sin Young; Jeong, Hyeonju; Kim, Jeong-Han; Oh, Hong Sang; Kang, Yu Min; Lee, Eun Bong; Kim, Nam Joong; Chin, Bum Sik; Park, Jin Kyun",Sci Rep,255,30

Nevertheless, a survey based on the data of the 2009 H1N1 epidemic in Istanbul, Turkey [19] displayed an unexpected time shift between the hospital referrals and fatalities. With the motivation of investigating the underlying reason, we use multistage SIR and SEIR models to provide an explanation for this time shift. Numerical solutions of these models present strong evidences that the delay is approximately half of the infection period of the epidemic disease. In addition, graphs of the classical SIR and the multistage SIR models; and the classical SEIR and the multistage SEIR models are compared for various epidemic parameters. Depending on the number of stages, it is observed that the delay varies for relatively small stage numbers whereas it does not change for large numbers in multistage systems. One important result that follows immediately from this observation is that this fixed delay for large numbers explains the time shift. Additionally, depending on the stage number and the duration of the epidemic disease, the distance between the points where each infectious stage reaches its maximum is found approximately both graphically and qualitatively for both systems. Variations of the time shift, the maximum point of the sum of all infectious stages, and the in ection point of the removed stage are observed subject to the stage number N and it is shown that these variations stay unchanged for greater values of N.","Dobie, Ayse Peker; Demirci, Ali; Bilge, Ayse Humeyra; Ahmetolan, Semra",,255,25

Vacation may help alleviate burnout and improve WLI but working while on vacation may negate these potential benefits. Little is known about the work patterns of women physicians on vacation, and we attempted to further characterize it in this study. Methods: In this online cross-sectional study of 498 members of the Physician Women in Leadership Facebook Group, we collected demographic information, information regarding burnout/WLI, self-reported work patterns while on vacation, and perceived impact of working during vacation on burnout/WLI. We also asked about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these behaviors. Results: At baseline, 37.5% of respondents reported burnout and 58.4% reported lack of satisfaction with WLI. About 94.4% of respondents reported engaging in some level of work-related behavior while on vacation (primarily answering work-related emails and participating in work-related meetings), but 73.3% reported that such engagement was detrimental to their mental health and WLI. About 66.3% reported an increase in at least one work-related behavior on vacation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents identified and/or endorsed multiple strategies to reduce work-related engagement on vacation, many involving good modeling by leadership and/or national associations. Conclusions: Engagement in work-related behavior while on vacation is almost universal among women physicians, but most feel that it has negative effects on mental health and WLI. Strategies to encourage reduced engagement should be developed/strengthened and endorsed/modeled by those in leadership.","Marshall, Ariela L; Elafros, Melissa; Duma, Narjust",J. womens health (Larchmt.),255,16

A randomised control trial (RCT) for a novel smartphone app-based model of care, named TeleClinical Care - Cardiac (TCC-Cardiac), commenced in February 2019, targeted at patients being discharged after care for an acute coronary syndrome or episode of decompensated heart failure. The app was paired to a digital sphygmomanometer, weighing scale and a wearable fitness band, all loaned to the patient, and allowed clinicians to respond to abnormal readings. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated several modifications to the trial in order to protect participants from potential exposure to infection. The use of TCC-Cardiac during the pandemic inspired the development of a similar model of care (TCC-COVID), targeted at patients being managed at home with a diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: Recruitment for the TCC-Cardiac trial was terminated shortly after the World Health Organization announced COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Telephone follow-up was commenced, in order to protect patients from unnecessary exposure to hospital staff and patients. Equipment was returned or collected by a 'no-contact' method. The TCC-COVID app and model of care had similar functionality to the original TCC-Cardiac app. Participants were enrolled exclusively by remote methods. Oxygen saturation and pulse rate were measured by a pulse oximeter, and symptomatology measured by questionnaire. Measurement results were manually entered into the app and transmitted to an online server for medical staff to review. RESULTS: A total of 164 patients were involved in the TCC-Cardiac trial, with 102 patients involved after the onset of the pandemic. There were no hospitalisations due to COVID-19 in this cohort. The study was successfully completed, with only three participants lost to follow-up. During the pandemic, 5 of 49 (10%) of patients in the intervention arm were readmitted compared to 12 of 53 (23%) in the control arm. Also, in this period, 28 of 29 (97%) of all clinically significant alerts received by the monitoring team were managed successfully in the outpatient setting, avoiding hospitalisation. Patients found the user experience largely positive, with the average rating for the app being 4.56 out of 5. 26 patients have currently been enrolled for TCC-COVID. Recruitment is ongoing. All patients have been safely and effectively monitored, with no major adverse clinical events or technical malfunctions. Patient satisfaction has been high. CONCLUSION: The TCC-Cardiac RCT was successfully completed despite the challenges posed by COVID-19. Use of the app had an added benefit during the pandemic as participants could be monitored safely from home. The model of care inspired the development of an app with similar functionality designed for use with patients diagnosed with COVID-19.","Indraratna, Praveen; Biswas, Uzzal; Yu, Jennifer; Schreier, Guenter; Ooi, Sze-Yuan; Lovell, Nigel H; Redmond, Stephen J",Yearb. med. inform.

Upon reviewing the metadata fields in each article, we discovered that 2010 began a metadata renaissance as publishers embraced metadata for improved search engine ranking, search engine tracking, social media tracking, and social media sharing. When analyzing individual fields, we find that one application of metadata stands out above all others: social cards -- the cards generated by platforms like Twitter when one shares a URL. Once a metadata standard was established for cards in 2010, its fields were adopted by 20% of articles in the first year and reached more than 95% adoption by 2016. This rate of adoption surpasses efforts like Schema.org and Dublin Core by a fair margin. When confronted with these results on how news publishers spend their metadata budget, we must conclude that it is all about the cards.","Jones, Shawn M.; Neblitt-Jones, Valentina; Weigle, Michele C.; Klein, Martin; Nelson, Michael L.",,255,16

We analysed the temporal trend in total excess mortality and deaths among positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 by geographical area (north and centre-south), age and sex, taking into account the deficit in mortality in previous months. METHODS: Data from the Italian rapid mortality surveillance system was used to quantify excess deaths during the epidemic, to estimate the mortality deficit during the previous months and to compare total excess mortality with deaths among positive cases of SARS-CoV-2. Data were stratified by geographical area (north vs centre and south), age and sex. RESULTS: COVID-19 had a greater impact in northern Italian cities among subjects aged 75-84 and 85+ years. COVID-19 deaths accounted for half of total excess mortality in both areas, with differences by age: almost all excess deaths were from COVID-19 among adults, while among the elderly only one third of the excess was coded as COVID-19. When taking into account the mortality deficit in the pre-pandemic period, different trends were observed by area: all excess mortality during COVID-19 was explained by deficit mortality in the centre and south, while only a 16% overlap was estimated in northern cities, with quotas decreasing by age, from 67% in the 15-64 years old to 1% only among subjects 85+ years old. CONCLUSIONS: An underestimation of COVID-19 deaths is particularly evident among the elderly. When quantifying the burden in mortality related to COVID-19, it is important to consider seasonal dynamics in mortality. Surveillance data provides an impartial indicator for monitoring the following phases of the epidemic, and may help in the evaluation of mitigation measures adopted.","Michelozzi, Paola; de039,; Donato, Francesca; Scortichini, Matteo; Pezzotti, Patrizio; Stafoggia, Massimo; De Sario, Manuela; Costa, Giuseppe; Noccioli, Fiammetta; Riccardo, Flavia; Bella, Antonino; Demaria, Moreno; Rossi, Pasqualino; Brusaferro, Silvio; Rezza, Giovanni; Davoli, Marina",BMC Public Health,255,16

In this study, COVID-19 ARDS patients admitted to the Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale of Lecco, Italy, between March 5th to April 15th, 2020, and who had received anakinra off-label were retrospectively evaluated and compared with a cohort of matched controls who did not receive immunomodulatory treatment. The primary end point was survival at day 28. The population consisted of 112 patients (56 treated with anakinra and 56 controls). Survival at day 28 was obtained in 69 patients (61.6%) and was significantly higher in anakinra-treated patients than in the controls (75.0 versus 48.2%, p = 0.007). When stratified by continuous positive airway pressure support at baseline, anakinra-treated patients' survival was also significant compared with the controls (p = 0.008). Univariate analysis identified anakinra usage (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.47-7.17) as a significant survival predictor. This was not supported by multivariate modeling.

The tournament was conducted within ‘bubbles’. All personnel travelling to the tournament were required to be in possession of a negative RT-PCR test within 72 hours of arrival and subjected to a testing schedule during the tournament. Each location was assigned a COVID-19 protocol enforcement officer to ensure adherence to regular testing, hygiene measures, physical distancing and daily symptom reporting (via ScribePro app).ResultsThe study involved 70 recruited staff with a combined 1321 test days on the symptom checker app. The mean number of days completed on the symptom checker app was 18.87 days (range: 7–28). Of the five questions asked as part of the daily symptom checker, only one was answered positively (0.015%). This individual was isolated, assessed within 20 min and tested. The initial diagnosis was likely a non-COVID-19-related viral illness. Further testing returned three negative tests during the remainder of the tournament.ConclusionsThere was no person-to-staff transmission of COVID-19 during the tournament within our sample. The organisation of a sporting tournament during the COVID-19 pandemic is possible with risk mitigation strategies. These strategies include setting up a bubble with regular testing, hygiene measures, physical distancing and daily symptom reporting.","Massey, Andrew Lindsay Sarah Seow Dexter Gordon Jonny Lowe David J.",BMJ Open Sport &amp; Exercise Medicine,255,1

We evaluated a cost-effective strategy for SARS-CoV-2 testing to determine point prevalence in a rural community with a generally low prevalence of infection. METHODS: We voluntarily tested asymptomatic clinic employees and conducted 2 community SARS-CoV-2 testing events in Cashton, Wisconsin, that included testing for asymptomatic persons. We also partnered with local clinics and public health departments to conduct weekly drive-up clinics for asymptomatic, high-risk persons identified through enhanced contact tracing. This was possible as testing capacity in Wisconsin never reached its maximum, and we continued symptomatic testing through our clinic. RESULTS: We tested 61 employees, 268 individuals at 2 community events, 36 high-risk asymptomatic people at drive-up clinic events, and 128 symptomatic people within our clinic. We observed 1 positive result in asymptomatic people and 5 positive results in symptomatic patients, confirming the low prevalence in our area. CONCLUSIONS: Our testing events confirmed a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing prevalence information to local businesses and schools. We reinforced our partnership with local public health departments to facilitate enhanced contact tracing and test asymptomatic persons, and we provided a service to asymptomatic persons requiring testing for travel, school, or work. Local businesses and community members appreciated the services and expressed relief for point-in-time testing results during a period of stress and uncertainty.","Freiberg, M.; Henningfield, M.

However, proper auscultation of these patients is difficult when medical workers wear personal protective equipment and when it is necessary to minimize contact with patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to design and develop a low-cost electronic stethoscope enabling ear-contactless auscultation and digital storage of data for further analysis. The clinical feasibility of our device was assessed in comparison to a standard electronic stethoscope. METHODS: We developed a prototype of the ear-contactless electronic stethoscope, called Auscul Pi, powered by Raspberry Pi and Python. Our device enables real-time capture of auscultation sounds with a microspeaker instead of an earpiece, and it can store data files for later analysis. We assessed the feasibility of using this stethoscope by detecting abnormal heart and respiratory sounds from 8 patients with heart failure or structural heart diseases and from 2 healthy volunteers and by comparing the results with those from a 3M Littmann electronic stethoscope. RESULTS: We were able to conveniently operate Auscul Pi and precisely record the patients' auscultation sounds. Auscul Pi showed similar real-time recording and playback performance to the Littmann stethoscope. The phonocardiograms of data obtained with the two stethoscopes were consistent and could be aligned with the cardiac cycles of the corresponding electrocardiograms. Pearson correlation analysis of amplitude data from the two types of phonocardiograms showed that Auscul Pi was correlated with the Littmann stethoscope with coefficients of 0.3245-0.5570 for healthy participants (P<.001) and of 0.3449-0.5138 among 4 patients (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Auscul Pi can be used for auscultation in clinical practice by applying real-time ear-contactless playback followed by quantitative analysis. Auscul Pi may allow accurate auscultation when medical workers are wearing protective suits and have difficulties in examining patients with COVID-19.

The analysis using synthesized data shows that our model correctly estimates $R$ and detects a short-term shock of the detection rate. Then, we apply our model to data from several countries to evaluate the effectiveness of public healthcare measures.

Microfluidics can separate and detect various particles/aerosols as well as cells/viruses in a cost-effective and easy-to-operate manner. There are a number of papers reviewing microfluidic separation and detection, but to the best of our knowledge, the two topics are normally reviewed separately. In fact, these two themes are closely related with each other from the perspectives of public health: understanding separation or sorting technique will lead to the development of new detection methods, thereby providing new paths to guide the separation routes. Therefore, the purpose of this review paper is two-fold: reporting the latest developments in the application of microfluidics for separation and outlining the emerging research in microfluidic detection.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine anxiety, depression, and musculoskeletal complaints that may occur in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data were cross-sectional, collected by the online questionnaire method consisted of demographic questions, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Nordic Musculoskeletal System Query (NMQ), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). RESULTS: Among the groups, the number of doctors in the frontline group, the fear of being infected, the number of tests performed, and personal protective equipment were higher than the second-line group (pâ<â0.05). It was found that 73.4% of the participants had anxiety, 83.5% had depression, and 94.9% had musculoskeletal pain. It was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the applied scale scores between the groups (pâ>â0.05). About musculoskeletal system complaints of the participants, neck pain presence was determined as 73.4% in the last 12 months, and upper back pain was the highest with 61.4% in the last week. Neck (pâ<â0.005) and upper back pain (pâ=â0.04) parameters in the last seven days of the NMQ scale applied to the participants were found to be statistically significantly higher in the contact group.

Effective audits can establish a framework for reporting research efforts, ensuring accurate reporting, and spearheading quality improvement. Although a variety of data auditing models and standards exist, barriers to effective auditing including costs, regulatory requirements, travel, and design complexity must be considered. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Congenital Cardiac Research Collaborative conducted a virtual data training initiative and remote source data verification audit on a retrospective multicentre dataset. CCRC investigators across nine institutions were trained to extract and enter data into a robust dataset on patients with tetralogy of Fallot who required neonatal intervention. Centres provided de-identified source files for a randomised 10% patient sample audit. Key auditing variables, discrepancy types, and severity levels were analysed across two study groups, primary repair and staged repair. RESULTS: Of the total 572 study patients, data from 58 patients (31 staged repairs and 27 primary repairs) were source data verified. Amongst the 1790 variables audited, 45 discrepancies were discovered, resulting in an overall accuracy rate of 97.5%. High accuracy rates were consistent across all CCRC institutions ranging from 94.6% to 99.4% and were reported for both minor (1.5%) and major discrepancies type classifications (1.1%). CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that implementing a virtual multicentre training initiative and remote source data verification audit can identify data quality concerns and produce a reliable, high-quality dataset. Remote auditing capacity is especially important during the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Pettus, Joelle A; Pajk, Amy L; Glatz, Andrew C; Petit, Christopher J; Goldstein, Bryan H; Qureshi, Athar M; Nicholson, George T; Meadows, Jeffery J; Zampi, Jeffrey D; Law, Mark A; Shahanavaz, Shabana; Kelleman, Michael S; McCracken, Courtney M",Cardiol Young,255,28

SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells by utilizing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of an envelope homotrimeric spike (S) glycoprotein to interact with the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We thoroughly studied the differences between the two RBDs of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 when they bind with ACE2 through molecular dynamics simulations. The peculiarities of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD are obvious in several aspects such as fluctuation of the binding interface, distribution of binding free energy on residues of the receptor-binding motifs, and the dissociation process. Based on these peculiarities of SARS-CoV-2 revealed by simulations, we proposed a strategy of destroying the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 by employing enzymatic digestion. This unique strategy is promising for developing a skin-friendly, nontoxic, and convenient disinfectant to protect people from infection by SARS-CoV-2.","Cao, Yufei; Ge, Jun",Langmuir,255,16

To expedite drug discovery, a computational approach is widely employed for the initial screening of anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidates. This study aimed to investigate the potential of peptides from quinoa seed proteins as multi-target antagonists against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain, main protease, and papain-like protease. Five quinoa proteins were hydrolyzed in silico by papain and subtilisin. Among the 1465 peptides generated, seven could interact stably with the key binding residues and catalytic residues of the viral targets, mainly via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The seven peptides were comparable or superior to previously reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 peptides based on docking scores. Key residues in the seven peptides contributing to binding to viral targets were determined by computational alanine scanning. The seven peptides were predicted in silico to be non-toxic and non-allergenic. The peptides ranged between 546.66 and 3974.87 g/mol in molecular mass, besides exhibiting basic and cationic properties (isoelectric points: 8.26-12.10; net charges: 0.1-4.0). Among the seven peptides, VEDKGMMHQQRMMEKAMNIPRMCGTMQRKCRMS was found to bind the largest number of key residues on the targets. In conclusion, seven putative non-toxic, non-allergenic, multi-target anti-SARS-CoV-2 peptides were identified from quinoa seed proteins. The in vitro and in vivo efficacies of the seven peptides against SARS-CoV-2 deserve attention in future bench-top testing.

To date, no effective therapeutic is available to fight its associated disease, COVID-19. Our discovery of a novel insertion of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding motif at S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site (681-686 (PRRARS)) and two other GAG-binding-like motifs within SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (SGP) led us to hypothesize that host cell surface GAGs may interact SARS-CoV-2 SGPs to facilitate host cell entry. Using a surface plasmon resonance direct binding assay, we found that both monomeric and trimeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP bind more tightly to immobilized heparin (KD = 40 pM and 73 pM, respectively) than the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV SGPs (500 nM and 1 nM, respectively). In competitive binding studies, the IC50 of heparin, tri-sulfated non-anticoagulant heparan sulfate, and non-anticoagulant low molecular weight heparin against SARS-CoV-2 SGP binding to immobilized heparin were 0.056 µM, 0.12 µM, and 26.4 µM, respectively. Finally, unbiased computational ligand docking indicates that heparan sulfate interacts with the GAG-binding motif at the S1/S2 site on each monomer interface in the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP, and at another site (453-459 (YRLFRKS)) when the receptor-binding domain is in an open conformation. The current study serves a foundation to further investigate biological roles of GAGs in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Furthermore, our findings may provide additional basis for further heparin-based interventions for COVID-19 patients exhibiting thrombotic complications.","Kim, So Young; Jin, Weihua; Sood, Amika; Montgomery, David W; Grant, Oliver C; Fuster, Mark M; Fu, Li; Dordick, Jonathan S; Woods, Robert J; Zhang, Fuming; Linhardt, Robert J",Antiviral Res,255,24

We estimated all-cause excess mortality, compared to the historical trends, to obtain an indirect estimate of COVID-19-related deaths. Methods: We assembled time series of the seasonal number of all-cause mortalities from March 21, 2013 (spring of 1392 SH) to March 19, 2020 (winter 1398 SH) for each province of Iran and nationwide with the vital statistics data from the National Organization for Civil Registration (NOCR). We estimated the expected seasonal mortality and excess mortality (the difference between the number of registered and expected deaths). Moreover, we reviewed the provincial number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 to assess their association with excess deaths. Results: The results of our analysis showed around 7507 (95% CI: 3,350 - 11,664) and 5180 (95% CI: 1,023 - 9,337) all-cause excess mortality in fall and winter, respectively. There were 3778 excess deaths occurred in Qom, Gilan, Mazandaran, and Golestan provinces in the winter, all among the COVID-19 epicenters based on the number of confirmed cases. Conclusion: We think most of the excess deaths in the winter were related to COVID-19. Also, we think the influenza epidemic might have been the main reason for the excess mortality in the fall and parts of excess deaths in the winter of 1398 SH. Moreover, a review of all available clinical and paraclinical records and through analyses of the surveillance data for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) can help to obtain a more accurate estimate of COVID-19 mortality.","Tadbiri, Hooman; Moradi-Lakeh, Maziar; Naghavi, Mohsen",Med J Islam Repub Iran,255,24

Using 129Xe MRI, we found COVID-19 patients have higher ventilation defects percentage (5.9% vs 3.7%), unchanged microstructure, longer gas-blood exchange time (43.5 ms vs 32.5 ms), and reduced RBC/TP (0.279 vs 0.330) compared with healthy subjects. These findings suggest regional ventilation and alveolar airspace dimensions are relatively normal around the time of discharge, while gas-blood exchange function is diminished.

Coronavirus (CoV) virions contain single-stranded RNA genomes with a lipid envelope and four proteins, three of which are associated with the lipid envelope and thus are thought to be easily denatured by heat or surfactant-type chemicals. Prior studies have shown that a temperature as low as 75°C with a treatment duration of 15 min can effectively inactivate CoV. The degree of CoV heat inactivation greatly depends on the length of heat treatment time and the temperature applied. With the goal of finding whether sub-second heat exposure of CoV can sufficiently inactivate CoV, we designed and developed a simple fluidic system that can measure sub-second heat inactivation of CoV. The system is composed of a stainless-steel capillary immersed in a temperature-controlled oil bath followed by an ice bath, through which virus solution can flow at various speeds. Flowing virus solution at different speeds, along with temperature control and monitoring system, allows the virus to be exposed to the desired temperature and treatment durations with high accuracy. Using mouse hepatitis virus, a betacoronavirus, as a model CoV system, we identified that 71.8°C for 0.51 s exposure is sufficient to obtain >5 Log10 reduction in viral titer (starting titer: 5 × 107 PFU/ml), and that when exposed to 83.4°C for 1.03 s, the virus was completely inactivated (>6 Log10 reduction).","Jiang, Yuqian; Zhang, Han; Wippold, Jose A; Gupta, Jyotsana; Dai, Jing; de Figueiredo, Paul; Leibowitz, Julian L; Han, Arum",Biotechnol Bioeng,255,27

Segmentation of lung infections in computerized tomography (CT) slices could be be used to improve diagnosis and understanding of COVID-19 in patients. Deep learning systems lack interpretability because of their black box nature. Inspired by human communication of complex ideas through language, we propose a symbolic framework based on emergent languages for the segmentation of COVID-19 infections in CT scans of lungs. We model the cooperation between two artificial agents - a Sender and a Receiver. These agents synergistically cooperate using emergent symbolic language to solve the task of semantic segmentation. Our game theoretic approach is to model the cooperation between agents unlike Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The Sender retrieves information from one of the higher layers of the deep network and generates a symbolic sentence sampled from a categorical distribution of vocabularies. The Receiver ingests the stream of symbols and cogenerates the segmentation mask. A private emergent language is developed that forms the communication channel used to describe the task of segmentation of COVID infections. We augment existing state of the art semantic segmentation architectures with our symbolic generator to form symbolic segmentation models. Our symbolic segmentation framework achieves state of the art performance for segmentation of lung infections caused by COVID-19. Our results show direct interpretation of symbolic sentences to discriminate between normal and infected regions, infection morphology and image characteristics. We show state of the art results for segmentation of COVID-19 lung infections in CT.","Chowdhury, Aritra; Santamaria-Pang, Alberto; Kubricht, James R.; Qiu, Jianwei; Tu, Peter",,255,1

To control the rapid dispersion of the virus, China has imposed national lockdown policies to practise social distancing. This has led to reduced human activities and hence primary air pollutant emissions, which caused improvement of air quality as a side-product. To investigate the air quality changes during the COVID-19 lockdown over the YRD Region, we apply the WRF-CAMx modelling system together with monitoring data to investigate the impact of human activity pattern changes on air quality. Results show that human activities were lowered significantly during the period: industrial operations, VKT, constructions in operation, etc. were significantly reduced, leading to lowered SO2, NOx, PM2.5 and VOCs emissions by approximately 16-26%, 29-47%, 27-46% and 37-57% during the Level I and Level II response periods respectively. These emission reduction has played a significant role in the improvement of air quality. Concentrations of PM2.5, NO2 and SO2 decreased by 31.8%, 45.1% and 20.4% during the Level I period; and 33.2%, 27.2% and 7.6% during the Level II period compared with 2019. However, ozone did not show any reduction and increased greatly. Our results also show that even during the lockdown, with primary emissions reduction of 15%-61%, the daily average PM2.5 concentrations range between 15 and 79 µg m-3, which shows that background and residual pollutions are still high. Source apportionment results indicate that the residual pollution of PM2.5 comes from industry (32.2-61.1%), mobile (3.9-8.1%), dust (2.6-7.7%), residential sources (2.1-28.5%) in YRD and 14.0-28.6% contribution from long-range transport coming from northern China. This indicates that in spite of the extreme reductions in primary emissions, it cannot fully tackle the current air pollution. Re-organisation of the energy and industrial strategy together with trans-regional joint-control for a full long-term air pollution plan need to be further taken into account.","Li, Li; Li, Qing; Huang, Ling; Wang, Qian; Zhu, Ansheng; Xu, Jian; Liu, Ziyi; Li, Hongli; Shi, Lishu; Li, Rui; Azari, Majid; Wang, Yangjun; Zhang, Xiaojuan; Liu, Zhiqiang; Zhu, Yonghui; Zhang, Kun; Xue, Shuhui; Ooi, Maggie Chel Gee; Zhang, Dongping; Chan, Andy",Sci Total Environ,255,1

South Tyrol is considered a model for fostering peaceful interethnic relations thanks to a complex power-sharing system. However, the arrival of migrants from foreign countries and the more recent influx of asylum seekers have revitalized debates around the borders between South Tyrol/Italy and Austria and among South Tyrolean linguistic groups. The current COVID-19 pandemic has brought further complexity to the issue. I use the concept of securitization - the process through which an issue is considered as an existential threat requiring exceptional measures - in order to understand why and how borders become exclusionary and restrictive, shaping dynamics of othering. With this framework, the article explores how South Tyrolean borders have been subjected to (de)securitizing and resecuritizing moves in discourses and practices. In this way, I shed new light on debates on the articulation of borders and interethnic relations that are occurring due to recent international migration, consolidation of nationalist agendas, and the current pandemic. © The Author(s), 2021.

However, Current studies largely concentrate on the effects of a single pollutant (BaP or DBP). The liver is vital for biogenic activities. The eï¬ects of BaP and DBP co-exposure on liver remain unclear. Thus, we treated human normal liver cell (L02 cell) with BaP or/and DBP. We found that compared to individual exposure, co-exposure to BaP and DBP induced further increased levels of AST and ALT. BaP and DBP co-exposure caused further increased levels of IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-&#945;, decreased IL-10 level, and a higher percentage of apoptotic cells and S-phase arrest cells. BaP and DBP co-exposure worsen the decrease of miR-122-5p level and chaos of SOCS1/STAT3 signaling. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assays showed that SOCS1 was a validated target of miR-122-5p. miR-122-5p overexpression alleviated the increased SOCS1 expression, decreased phospho-STAT3 expression, decreased IL-10 level, increased TNF-&#945; levels, increased percentage of apoptosis and S-phase arrest, and cytotoxicity induced by BaP and DBP co-exposure in hepatocytes. These results suggested that miR-122-5p negatively regulated the synergistic effects on apoptosis and disorder of inflammatory factor secretion involved in hepatocyte injury caused by BaP and DBP co-exposure through targeting SOCS1/STAT3 signaling.","Liu, Yining; Chen, Wenyan; Chen, Jing; Ma, Yemei; Cen, Yanli; Wang, Shengli; He, Xiu; You, Mingdan; Yang, Guanghong",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,255,15

From the start of the pandemic, we used electronic medical record-assisted telephone follow-up (E-TFU) of cancer survivors (CS) to minimize hospital exposure. The aim of this prospective study was to assess how breast cancer survivors (bCSs) perceived E-TFU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 15-item survey was e-mailed to bCSs who had been managed with E-TFU. The responses were measured using Likert-like scales and were correlated with the main characteristics of the bCS using Pearson's test. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-seven of 343 bCSs (40%) completed the survey between March 9 and June 2, 2020. Their median age was 59 years. Although 80.3% of bCSs were satisfied with E-TFU, only 43.8% would like to have E-TFU in the future. A low educational level was correlated with higher COVID-19-related anxiety (P = .025). An older age (P = .002) and a low educational level (P < .0001) were correlated with the need to be accompanied to reach the hospital. A personal history of second cancer was inversely correlated with understanding medical advice (P = .015) and the expectation of feeling relief after a follow-up visit (P = .0027). Furthermore, pandemic phase II was correlated with satisfaction with E-TFU (P = .010). CONCLUSION: E-TFU was an important means of avoiding hospital contacts during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the majority of bCSs in the survey were satisfied with this procedure. Further studies are needed to investigate the implementation of telemedicine even outside an emergency situation.","Merz, Valeria; Ferro, Antonella; Piras, Enrico Maria; Zanutto, Alberto; Caffo, Orazio; Messina, Carlo",JCO Oncol Pract,255,16

This survey aims to highlight the status of the implementation of occupational protection measures for nurses working on the front line against COVID-19, and to analyze the problems in the process of wearing protective equipment.This cross-sectional study was conducted among 165 nurses who worked in COVID-19-stricken areas in China in March 2020. The questionnaire covered 3 aspects, namely: general information, the current condition of protective equipment wearing, and the wearing experience of protective equipment.A total of 160 (96.97%) valid questionnaires were collected. The average time of wearing protective equipment for the nurses surveyed was 6.38â±â3.30âhours per working day. For first-line nurses with low risk of infection, repeated wear of protective equipment was as follows: medical protective mask 30.77%, double latex gloves 8.46%, goggles/protective mask 15.38%, protective suit 15.38%; less wear of protective equipment were as follows: work cap 7.69%, surgical mask 7.69%, single layer latex gloves 30.77%, goggles/protective mask 30.77%, and isolation gown 46.15%. For nurses who were at moderate risk of infection, repeated wear of protective equipment was as follows: surgical mask 62.22%, goggles/protective mask 68.89%, and isolation gown 65.56%; less wear: work cap 3.33%, medical protective mask 15.56%, latex gloves 15.56%, goggles/protective mask 5.56%, and protective suit 16.67%. For front-line nurses with high risk of infection, repeated wear of protective equipment was as follows: surgical mask 64.91%, more than double latex gloves 8.77%, goggles/protective mask 75.44%, isolation gown 75.44%; less wear: work cap 1.75%, medical protective mask 1.75%, latex gloves 26.32%, goggles/ protective mask 1.75%, protective suit 1.75%. The main discomforts of wearing protective equipment were poor vision due to fogging (81.88%), stuffiness (79.38%), poor mobility (74.38%), sweating (72.5%), and skin damage (61.25%).More detailed personal protection standards should be developed, and the work load of nurses should be reduced. Actions should be taken to ensure the scientific implementation of personal protective measures. To solve practical clinical problems, future protective equipment may focus on the research and development of protective equipment applicable for different risk levels, as well as the research on integrated design, fabric innovation, and reusability.","Wu, Maojie; Zhang, Lin; Ning, Ning; Liu, Li; Liu, Xiaoyan",Medicine (Baltimore),255,16

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Governmental- designated facility in the eastern province, Saudi Arabia. PARTICIPANTS: 128 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 quarantined individuals who had a history of travel abroad in the last 14 days before the quarantine or were in direct contact with laboratory-confirmed cases. The study was from March 18th-till April 16th. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY MEASURES: The clinical presentation, prevalence of asymptomatic carriers among SARS-COV-2 positive quarantined subjects, and the difference between virus clearance among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. RESULTS: Sixty-nine of the 128 residents (54%) were completely asymptomatic until the end of the study. The remaining 59 residents (46%) had only mild symptoms. The most common symptom was a sudden loss of smell and taste, accounting for 47.5%. The median time to virus clearance was significantly different between the two groups. Symptomatic residents cleared the virus at a median of 17 days (95% CI, 12.4-21.6) from the first positive PCR vs. 11days (95% CI, 8.7-13.3) in the asymptomatic group (P = 0.011). False-negative test results occurred in 18.8% of the total residents and false-positive results in 3%. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of asymptomatic carriers among quarantined travelers and those identified by contact tracing is high in our study. Therefore, testing, tracing, and isolating travelers and contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases, regardless of symptoms, were very effective measures for early disease identification and containment. Loss of taste and smell were the most common presentations in our mild symptomatic residents and should be used as a screening tool for COVID-19. The persistent positive PCR beyond 14 days observed in the mild symptomatic residents despite being symptoms free, warrant further studies to determine its implications on disease spread and control.","Alshami, Alanoud; Alattas, Rabab; Anan, Hadeel; Alhalimi, Abdulbary; Alfaraj, Ahmed; Al Qahtani, Hadi",PLoS One,255,16

COVID-19 also presents with multiple ancillary systemic diseases and often involves cardiovascular, inflammatory, and/or neurological complications. Pathological viral genomes consisting of ssvRNA, like cellular messenger RNA (mRNA), are susceptible to attack, destruction, neutralization, and/or modulation by naturally occurring small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) within the host cell, some of which are known as microRNAs (miRNAs). This paper proposes that the actions of the 2650 known human miRNAs and other sncRNAs form the basis for an under-recognized and unappreciated innate-immune regulator of ssvRNA viral genome activities and have implications for the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 invasion, infection, and replication. Recent research indicates that both miRNA and mRNA abundance, speciation, and complexity varies widely amongst human individuals, and this may: (i) In part explain the variability in the innate-immune immunological and pathophysiological response of different human individuals to the initiation and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple tissue types;and (ii) further support our understanding of human biochemical and genetic individuality and the variable resistance of individuals to ssvRNA-mediated viral infection and disease. This commentary will briefly address current findings and concepts in this fascinating research area of non-coding RNA and innate-immunity with special reference to natural host miRNAs, SARS-CoV-2, and the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Lukiw, Walter J.",Non-Coding RNA,255,1

Contrary to conventional medicine, it is based on a teleological image of humanity, a holistic and sustainable approach towards curing sickness, and an up-to-date concept of medical theory in terms of healing arts. However, under today's frameworked conditions of industrialisation, commercialisation and commodification, the strengths of homeopathy tend to be disregarded or even attacked, and a special kind of reductionist and materialist rationality, compatible with expanding markets and profits, is preferably facilitated.

The widespread of this epidemic has not only threatened human health but also production, economy, social functioning, education, etc. In this critical pandemic situation, a large number of the population are fighting for their lives and economic challenges for survival. Although digital health would not be the main contributor in combating COVID-19, it could play a very important supporting role in control and prevention work. During this isolation period, various digital applications are needed to ensure a normal life for most of the people. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics, big data, cloud computing, Internet of things (IoT) and other digital technologies are playing a vital role in managing routine activities through work from home, online education, remote patient treatment, citizen protection, risk communication, and medical supplies. On the downside, various technical threats like online fraud and cyber-attacks are rising and increasing challenges in the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this paper is to explore the available COVID-19 statistics and understand the impacts with technical threats to relief measures in India caused in the current pandemic.

The survey was carried out among 128 dental HCWs from three dental clinics of Ekaterinburg, Russia. The mean age of the sample was 38.6 years. Depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21); PTSD was assessed using the PTSD Symptom Scale-Self-Report (PSS-SR); subjective distress was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The results indicated that 20.3-24.2% HCWs had mild to extremely severe symptoms of psychological distress, and 7.1-29.7% had clinical symptoms of PTSD. No differences between females and males were revealed. HCWs working directly with patients had significantly higher levels of PTSD symptoms and the risk of PTSD development compared to those working indirectly, whereas older HCWs had significantly higher levels of both psychological distress and PTSD symptoms compared to younger HCWs. Thus, dental HCWs are at high risk for psychological distress and PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sarapultseva, Maria; Zolotareva, Alena; Kritsky, Igor; Nasretdinova, Natal039; ya,; Sarapultsev, Alexey",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),255,30

A test-and-isolate strategy, using PCR diagnostic tests, could help to minimise the impact of this second wave. Meanwhile, population-level serological surveillance can provide valuable insights into the level of immunity in the population. Using a mathematical model, consistent with an Indian megacity, we examined how seroprevalence data could guide a test-and-isolate strategy, for fully lifting restrictions. For example, if seroprevalence is 20% of the population, we show that a testing strategy needs to identify symptomatic cases within 5-8 days of symptom onset, in order to prevent a resurgent wave from overwhelming hospital capacity in the city. This estimate is robust to uncertainty in the effectiveness of the lockdown, as well as in immune protection against reinfection. To set these results in their economic context, we estimate that the weekly cost of such a PCR-based testing programme would be less than 2.1% of the weekly economic loss due to the lockdown. Our results illustrate how PCR-based testing and serological surveillance can be combined to design evidence-based policies, for lifting lockdowns in Indian cities and elsewhere.","Mandal, Sandip; Das, Hemanshu; Deo, Sarang; Arinaminpathy, Nimalan",Sci Rep,255,16

Meta-analysis of 10 studies (n = 41,807, weighted age 56 ± 8 years, men 51%, hypertension 34%, diabetes 21%, statin users 14%) that reported adjusted hazard ratios for mortality in statin users versus non-users showed pooled estimate at 0.65 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.53, 0.81). Meta-analysis of 6 studies that reported continuation of statin therapy during hospitalization (58-100% of patients) revealed a pooled hazard ratio of 0.54 (95% CI 0.47, 0.62). Meta-analysis of 12 studies (n = 72,881, weighted age 65 ± 2 years, men 54%, hypertension 66%, diabetes 43%, statin users 30%) that reported adjusted odds ratios for mortality showed pooled estimate at 0.65 (95% CI 0.55, 0.78). Multivariable meta-regression analysis did not reveal any significant association of hazard or odds ratios with anthropometric characteristics or comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of retrospective observational studies showed that statin therapy was associated with an about 35% decrease in the adjusted risk of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Kollias, Anastasios; Kyriakoulis, Konstantinos G; Kyriakoulis, Ioannis G; Nitsotolis, Thomas; Poulakou, Garyphallia; Stergiou, George S; Syrigos, Konstantinos",Atherosclerosis,255,13

Although SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks respiratory systems, manifestations of multiple organs have been detected. A significant concern was raised about whether COVID-19 may affect female and male reproductive functions. These findings imposed more restrictions on social relationships between individuals even if inside the family, adding more physiologic load. In this context, there is a crucial need to identify the biological and behavioral reproductive risk factors associated with COVID-19 disease. Questions regarding the potential risks of sexual transmission during intercourse and/or application of ART, vertical transmission (throughout pregnancy, delivery, and breastfeeding), the health of pregnant and postpartum women, and fetal or postnatal health problems of neonates/children remain largely unanswered. The contribution of individuals to different social and economic activities depends on the maintenance of good quality life and health. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic raised on the end of December 2019 has drastically affected different aspects of human wellbeing. The pandemic not only affected the health of individuals, but also negatively affected mental health and social interaction. This review illustrates: a) scientific findings related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the reproductive process, considering gender, hormonal balance, gonad functions, pregnancy, and ART, b) the sociosexual dimension of COVID-19 disease and precautions that should be taken to avoid infection via sexual transmission or vertical transmission, which may alleviate the fear associated with continuing normal social relationships and economic activities.","Hashem, Nesrein M; Abdelnour, Sameh A; Alhimaidi, Ahmad R; Swelum, Ayman A",,255,1

The aims of this study were to identify clinical differences between patients with vasovagal syncope and those with epileptic seizures, which account for a large proportion of TLOC cases, and to evaluate the effectiveness of various diagnostic tests. METHODS: The medical records of 160 children and adolescents with TLOC were analyzed retrospectively, and age, sex, clinical symptoms, and trigger factors were recorded. The cardiological and neurological evaluations performed included electrocardiograms, computed tomography scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalograms (EEGs), echocardiograms, and head-up tilt tests (HUTTs). Overall assessments of the 160 patients generated final diagnoses. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 14.6 years old and TLOC occurred more frequently among girls (59.4%). The most common final diagnosis was vasovagal syncope (n = 102, 63.4%), followed by undetermined (n = 21, 13.1%) and epileptic seizures (n = 17, 10.6%). There were many other diagnoses, including cardiogenic syncope (1.3%). Patients diagnosed with vasovagal syncope were much more likely to have dizziness or light-headedness and blurred vision as pre-symptoms (p < 0.05), whereas patients diagnosed with epileptic seizures were more likely to have convulsions as an accompanying sign (p < 0.05). In addition, standing up was the most significant trigger factor for TLOC among those diagnosed with vasovagal syncope (p < 0.05). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the HUTT for vasovagal syncope were 95.1%, 75.0%, and 91.8%, respectively. Similarly, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of EEGs for epileptic seizures were 80.0%, 70.6%, and 80.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Vasovagal syncope and epileptic seizures should be considered as possible causes of most cases of TLOC in children and adolescents. An accurate case history and appropriate evaluation are essential for correct diagnoses.","Choi, Young Ju; Han, Mi Young; Lee, Eun Hye",,255,24

A total of forty, day-old Hy-Line W-36 layer pullets were equally divided and randomly assigned to one of two dietary treatments with SCFP, or without (PCON) and orally gavaged on Day 28 with 10 6 CFU/mL of SE. Another twenty, day-old layer pullets were fed the same control feed without SCFP and blank inoculated on Day 28 with 1 ml of sterile PBS to serve as a negative control (NCON). Qualitative and quantitative analyses of cecal Salmonella contents were performed for all birds on Day 32. The prevalence of SE in the ceca of all directly challenged birds was 100%, however, the SE concentration in birds fed SCFP diet (3.35 Log 10 CFU/g) was significantly lower ( P <0.0001) than that of the PCON birds not fed SCFP (4.49 Log 10 CFU/g). Moreover, the proportion of SE colonized individuals with enumerable SE concentrations was lower in SCFP fed birds (57.9%) when compared to the PCON (95.0%). These data suggest that inclusion of SCFP in the diet may aid in the reduction of SE within the ceca of commercial laying hens and could serve as an additional, pre-harvest food safety hurdle.","Gingerich, Eric; Frana, Tim; Logue, Catherine M; Smith, Douglas P; Pavlidis, Hilary O; Chaney, William Evan",J. foof prot,255,30

It was responsible for the death of over one million people and posed an economic recession. This paper studies the spread pattern of COVID-19, aiming to establish a prediction model for this event. We harness Data Mining and Machine Learning methodologies to train regression models to predict the number of confirmed cases in a spatial-temporal space. We introduce an innovative concept ‒ the Center of Infection Mass (CoIM) ‒ adapted from the field of physics. We empirically evaluated our model on western European countries, based on the CoIM index and other features, and showed that a relatively high accurate prediction of the spread can be obtained. Our contribution is twofold: first, we introduced a prediction methodology and proved empirically that a prediction can be made even to the range of over a month;second, we showed promise in adopting the CoIM index to prediction models, when models that adopt the CoIM yield significantly better results than those that discard it. By applying our model, and better controlling the inherent tradeoff between life-saving and economy we believe that decision-makers can take close to optimal measures. Thus, this methodology may contribute to public welfare.","Hirschprung, Ron S.; Hajaj, Chen",Heliyon,255,2

From the many public responses, especially those on Twitter regarding the #newnormal campaign, a sentiment analysis process needs to be carried out to find out the perceptions that exist in society through social media. In this study, data were obtained through the crawling process on Twitter using the Twitter API. The method used in the sentiment analysis process is lexicon-based. The lexicon-based method works by labeling words containing sentiments based on a lexicon dictionary that already has weight on each word or doesn’t have weight on words in a lexicon dictionary. The classification results using lexicon-based are also used to make training data in the testing process using the naive Bayes classifier algorithm. In general, the research stages in this sentiment analysis include data crawling, text preprocessing, feature extractions, and the classification process. The sentiment analysis process results showed that the percentage of social media users on Twitter about #newnormal was 33.19% containing negative sentiments and 66.36% containing positive sentiments. Meanwhile, for testing the naive Bayes classifier algorithm in the sentiment analysis process got an accuracy of 79.72%.","Mustofa, R. L.; Prasetiyo, B.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,255,1

This study addresses the cytological features of the infection and highlights the more influential inflammatory components. The correlation between pathological variables and clinical data is also analyzed. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of the cytopathological features of BAL in 20 COVID-19 patients and 20 members of a matched cohort from a critical ICU who had acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by other pulmonary conditions. RESULTS: A comparison of the controls (n = 20) and the COVID-19 patients (n = 20) revealed that the latter had a higher neutrophil count (median, 63.8% of the cell count) with lower percentages of macrophages and lymphocytes. An increase in the expression of CD68-positive, monocytic multinucleated giant cells (MGCs) was reported; megakaryocytes were not detected on CD61 staining. Perls staining showed isolated elements. In situ RNA analysis demonstrated scattered chromogenic signals in type II pneumocytes. An ultrastructural analysis confirmed the presence of intracytoplasmic vacuoles containing rounded structures measuring 140 nm in diameter (putative viral particles). In COVID-19 patients, the clinicopathological correlation revealed a positive correlation between lactate dehydrogenase values and MGCs (r = 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of BAL samples might be implemented as a routine practice for the evaluation of COVID-19 patients in ICUs in the appropriate clinical scenario. Additional studies using a larger sample size of patients who developed COVID-19 during the second wave of the epidemic in the autumn of 2020 are needed to further support our findings.","Canini, Valentina; Bono, Francesca; Calzavacca, Paolo; Capitoli, Giulia; Foti, Giuseppe; Fraggetta, Filippo; Galimberti, Stefania; Gianatti, Andrea; Giani, Marco; Nasr, Ahmed; Paciocco, Giuseppe; Pagni, Fabio; Rona, Roberto; L039,; Imperio, Vincenzo",Cancer cytophathol,255,29

In spite of its clinical relevance and impact on feline health, currently the therapeutic possibilities for treatment of FIP in cats are limited. The emergence of the pandemic Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), etiological agent of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), able to infect a broad spectrum of animal species including cats, triggered the interest for the development of novel molecules with antiviral activity for treatment of CoV infections in humans and animals. Essential oils (EOs) have raised significant attention for their antiviral properties integrating and, in some cases, replacing conventional drugs. Thymus vulgaris EO (TEO) has been previously shown to be effective against several RNA viruses including CoVs. In the present study the antiviral efficacy of TEO against FIPV was evaluated in vitro. TEO at 27 µg/ml was able to inhibit virus replication with a significant reduction of 2 log10 TCID50/50 µl. Moreover, virucidal activity was tested using TEO at 27 and 270 µg/ml, over the cytotoxic threshold, determining a reduction of viral titre as high as 3.25 log10 TCID50/50 µl up to 1 h of time contact. These results open several perspectives in terms of future applications and therapeutic possibilities for coronaviruses considering that FIPV infection in cats could be a potential model for the study of antivirals against CoVs.","Catella, Cristiana; Camero, Michele; Lucente, Maria Stella; Fracchiolla, Giuseppe; Sblano, Sabina; Tempesta, Maria; Martella, Vito; Buonavoglia, Canio; Lanave, Gianvito",Res Vet Sci,255,29

Intrapulmonary p63+ progenitor cells, a rare cell type in mice but potentially encompassing more numerous classic basal cells in humans, are activated in such severe injury settings, proliferating and migrating into the injured alveolar parenchyma, providing a short-term ""emergency"" benefit. While the fate of these cells is controversial, most studies indicate that they represent a maladaptive repair pathway with a fate restriction toward airway cell types, rarely differentiating into AT2 or AT1 cells.

We derive several key epidemiological metrics and then propose an age-stratified vaccination strategy to decrease the mortality and hospitalizations. Through extensive study, we discover that the outcome of vaccination prioritization depends on the reproduction number R0. Specifically, the elderly should be prioritized only when R0 is relatively high. If ongoing intervention policies, such as universal masking, could suppress R0 at a relatively low level, prioritizing the high-transmission age group (i.e., adults aged 20-39) is most effective to reduce both mortality and hospitalizations. These conclusions provide useful recommendations for age-based vaccination pri-oritization for COVID-19.

One of the potential prognostic indicators in patients with COVID-19 is frailty. The degree of frailty could be used to assist both the triage into intensive care, and decisions regarding treatment limitations. Our study sought to determine the interaction of frailty and age in elderly COVID-19 ICU patients. METHODS: A prospective multicentre study of COVID-19 patients &#8805; 70 years admitted to intensive care in 138 ICUs from 28 countries was conducted. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. Frailty was assessed using the clinical frailty scale. Additionally, comorbidities, management strategies and treatment limitations were recorded. RESULTS: The study included 1346 patients (28% female) with a median age of 75 years (IQR 72-78, range 70-96), 16.3% were older than 80 years, and 21% of the patients were frail. The overall survival at 30 days was 59% (95% CI 56-62), with 66% (63-69) in fit, 53% (47-61) in vulnerable and 41% (35-47) in frail patients (p < 0.001). In frail patients, there was no difference in 30-day survival between different age categories. Frailty was linked to an increased use of treatment limitations and less use of mechanical ventilation. In a model controlling for age, disease severity, sex, treatment limitations and comorbidities, frailty was independently associated with lower survival. CONCLUSION: Frailty provides relevant prognostic information in elderly COVID-19 patients in addition to age and comorbidities.

This pandemic also represents a major challenge for statisticians involved in quantifying the phenomenon and in offering timely tools for the monitoring and surveillance of critical pandemic parameters. In a recent paper, Alleva et al. (2020) proposed a two-stage sample design to build a continuous-time surveillance system designed to correctly quantify the number of infected people through an indirect sampling mechanism that could be repeated in several waves over time to capture different target variables in the different stages of epidemic development. The proposed method exploits the indirect sampling (Lavalle, 2007; Kiesl, 2016) method employed in the estimation of rare and elusive populations (Borchers, 2009; Lavall\'ee and Rivest, 2012) and a capture/recapture mechanism (Sudman, 1988; Thompson and Seber, 1996). In this paper, we extend the proposal of Alleva et al. (2020) to include a spatial sampling mechanism (M\""uller, 1998; Grafstr\""om et al., 2012, Jauslin and Till\`e, 2020) in the process of data collection to achieve the same level of precision with fewer sample units, thereby facilitating the process of data collection in a situation where timeliness and costs are crucial elements. We present the basic idea of the new sample design, analytically prove the theoretical properties of the associated estimators and show the relative advantages through a systematic simulation study where all the typical elements of an epidemic are accounted for.","Alleva, Giorgio; Arbia, Giuseppe; Falorsi, Piero Demetrio; Nardelli, Vincenzo; Zuliani, Alberto",,255,5

Here, we use empirical vessel tracking data and a newly developed algorithm to estimate the global maritime trade losses during the first eight months of the pandemic. Our results show widespread trade losses on a port level with the largest absolute losses found for ports in China, the Middle-East and Western Europe, associated with the collapse of specific supply-chains (e.g. oil, vehicle manufacturing). In total, we estimate that global maritime trade reduced by -7.0% to -9.6% during the first eight months of 2020, which is equal to around 206-286 million tonnes in volume losses and up to 225-412 billion USD in value losses. The fishery, mining and quarrying, electrical equipment and machinery manufacturing, and transport equipment manufacturing sectors are hit hardest, with losses up to 11.8%. Moreover, we find a large geographical disparity in losses, with some small islands developing states and low-income economies suffering the largest relative trade losses. We find a clear negative impact of COVID-19 related business and public transport closures on country-wide exports. Overall, we show how real-time indicators of economic activity can support governments and international organisations in economic recovery efforts and allocate funds to the hardest hit economies and sectors.","Verschuur, Jasper; Koks, Elco; Hall, Jim",,255,1

ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 protein spike triggers viral fusion with the cell plasma membrane, resulting in viral RNA genome delivery into the host. Despite ACE2's critical role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, full understanding of ACE2 expression, including in response to viral infection, remains unclear. ACE2 was thought to encode five transcripts and one protein of 805 amino acids. In the present study, we identify a novel short isoform of ACE2 expressed in the airway epithelium, the main site of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Short ACE2 is substantially upregulated in response to interferon stimulation and rhinovirus infection, but not SARS-CoV-2 infection. This short isoform lacks SARS-CoV-2 spike high-affinity binding sites and, altogether, our data are consistent with a model where short ACE2 is unlikely to directly contribute to host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Blume, Cornelia; Jackson, Claire L; Spalluto, Cosma Mirella; Legebeke, Jelmer; Nazlamova, Liliya; Conforti, Franco; Perotin, Jeanne-Marie; Frank, Martin; Butler, John; Crispin, Max; Coles, Janice; Thompson, James; Ridley, Robert A; Dean, Lareb S N; Loxham, Matthew; Reikine, Stephanie; Azim, Adnan; Tariq, Kamran; Johnston, David A; Skipp, Paul J; Djukanovic, Ratko; Baralle, Diana; McCormick, Christopher J; Davies, Donna E; Lucas, Jane S; Wheway, Gabrielle; Mennella, Vito",Nat Genet,255,33

METHODS: A nationwide online, cross-sectional survey was conducted in Qatar from 15th October 2020 to 15th November 2020 with voluntary participation open to all adult residents. Of the respondents, the population group for this study comprised the 341 pregnant and breastfeeding participants. The survey utilized a composite questionnaire incorporating a validated instrument to measure vaccine attitudes. The responses were recorded and analysed with statistical analysis being performed with SPSS software. Outcome measures included intentions towards vaccination and potential factors influencing vaccine hesitancy (contextual factors, vaccine specific concerns and group/individual influences). RESULTS: Perinatal women exhibited a vaccine hesitancy rate of 25% towards COVID-19 immunisation. The main concerns of the group were of infection risks and main factor determining vaccine hesitancy was of vaccine specific safety concerns. Previous vaccine ""acceptors"" showed vaccine hesitancy to COVID-19 immunisation. A third of the group cited non availability of the vaccine as a concern. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine trials amongst pregnant and lactating women have lagged behind those for general populations and this has compounded concerns around safety in this special group. Perinatal women constitute a vulnerable group and play an important role in vaccination of wider family members. This study highlights the need for trials and data for COVID-19 vaccine in this group to be able to achieve appreciable numbers needed for herd immunity and ultimately control of the pandemic.","Mohan, Suruchi; Reagu, Shuja; Lindow, Stephen; Alabdulla, Majid",J Perinat Med,255,28

A mobile lab was deployed between March and May 2020 to characterize the spatial distribution of sub-10 nm particle number concentration. New particle formation and growth events were observed regularly. Also observed were direct emissions of sub-10 nm particles. Analysis against meteorological variables, gas-phase species, and particle concentrations show that the sub-10nm particles dominated number concentration during periods of low planetary boundary layer height, low solar radiation, and northeast winds. The spatial patterns observed during mobile deployments suggest that multiple temporally stable and spatially confined point sources of sub-10 nm particles are present within the city.

In analysing the annual reports and other documentary sources through qualitative content analysis, the study explores how different actors responded to the conceptual and technical contradictions posed by the monetary valuation of “heritage assets”, the accounting phraseology of accounting standards.FindingsFour phases emerge from the analysis undertaken of the empirical material, each characterised by a distinctive nature of the paradox, the institutional responses discerned and the outcomes. Although a persisting heterogeneity in the practice of accounting for cultural heritage is evident, responses by cultural institutions are shown to have minimised, so far, the negative impacts of monetary valuation in terms of commercialisation of deaccessioning decisions and distorted accountability.Originality/valueIn applying the theoretical lens of paradox theory in the context of the financial reporting of heritage, as assets, the study enhances an understanding of the challenges and responses by major public cultural institutions in a country that has led this development globally, providing insights to accounting standard setters arising from the accounting practices observed.","Ferri, Paolo Shannon I.

We addressed prevailing primary concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, current levels of negative emotions and risk factors predicting negative emotions. On April 1st to 4th 2020, 5158 adults from the general public completed an online survey. Participants ranked their top ten current primary concerns about COVID-19, and completed standardized measures of negative emotions. The top three primary concerns were related to health and well-being of family and loved ones. Levels of negative emotion were high. Modelling of predictors of negative emotions established several risk factors related to demographic variables, personal vulnerabilities, financial stresses, and social distancing perceptions; particularly being young, female, or having a mental illness diagnosis. The data provides important characterization of the current Australian mental health. It appears that specific groups may need special attention to ensure their mental health is protected.

We conducted a historical review of the literature on the origin of the face mask, the scientific evidence of its benefits, and its implications for domestic and international politics. Material and Methods: We performed a comprehensive search for peer- and nonpeer- reviewed literature published between 1905 and 2020. Results: Face mask wearing in hospital settings to prevent disease transmission from health care workers to their patients originates with the first use of the mask in surgery in 1897 by German surgeon Johann von Mikulicz. During the first half of the 20th century, various scientific investigators focused on determining the most effective type of medical mask. The role of the face mask in the general population as a preventive intervention during public health emergencies is supported by historical reports spanning from the European Bubonic Plague in 1619, to the Great Manchurian Plague of 1910-1911, the influenza pandemic of 1918, and the current coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although the face mask has helped against airborne disease transmission, its benefits during pandemics have been filtered through the prism of political leanings and geopolitical interests. Conclusions: Our review suggests that while face mask alone cannot stop pandemics, in conjunction with other nonpharmacologic interventions it can be useful in mitigating them. When cooperation rather than division becomes the norm in the global response to pandemics, the face mask can then unite rather than divide us.","Kristo, Gentian; He, Katherine; Whang, Edward; Fisichella, Piero M",J Laparoendosc Adv Surg Tech A,255,16

We predict the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and sgRNAs to be enriched toward the host mitochondrial matrix and nucleolus, and that the 5' and 3' viral untranslated regions contain the strongest, most distinct localization signals. We interpret the mitochondrial residency signal as an indicator of intracellular RNA trafficking with respect to double-membrane vesicles, a critical stage in the coronavirus life cycle.

Patients' fear regarding the pandemic would be the only reason to reduce surgeries, so Taiwan could be the most suitable place for research on the influence of psychological factors. This study aimed to assess the impact of patients' fear on orthopedic surgeries in Taiwan amid the peak period of the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The investigation period included the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 to April 2020) and the corresponding period in the previous year. The following data on patients with orthopedic diseases were collected: outpatient visits, hospital admission, and surgical modalities. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a 22%-29% and 20%-26% reduction in outpatients, 22%-27% and 25%-37% reduction in admissions, and 26%-35% and 18%-34% reduction in surgeries, respectively, at both hospitals. The weekly mean number of patients was significantly smaller during the COVID-19 pandemic for all types of surgery and elective surgeries at the university hospital, and for all types of surgery, elective surgeries, and total knee arthroplasties at the community hospital. Further, patients visiting the community hospital during the pandemic were significantly younger, for all types of surgery, elective surgeries, and total knee arthroplasties. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in orthopedic surgeries in Taiwan's hospitals during COVID-19 could be attributed to patients' fear. Even without restriction, the pandemic inevitably led to a reduction of about 20%-30% of the operation volume.","Shih, Chia-Lung; Huang, Peng-Ju; Huang, Hsuan-Ti; Chen, Chung-Hwan; Lee, Tien-Ching; Hsu, Chia-Hao",J Orthop Surg (Hong Kong),255,24

Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a retrospective cohort study of 20â¯736 adults with a diagnosis of COVID-19 who were included in the US American Heart Association COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry and admitted to 107 acute care hospitals in 31 states from March through November 2020. A multiple mixed-effects logistic regression was then used to estimate the odds of in-hospital death adjusted for patient age, sex, body mass index, and medical history as well as vital signs, use of supplemental oxygen, presence of pulmonary infiltrates at admission, and hospital site. Main Outcomes and Measures: In-hospital death adjusted for exposures for 4 periods in 2020. Results: The registry included 20â¯736 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March through November 2020 (9524 women [45.9%]; mean [SD] age, 61.2 [17.9] years); 3271 patients (15.8%) died in the hospital. Mortality rates were 19.1% in March and April, 11.9% in May and June, 11.0% in July and August, and 10.8% in September through November. Compared with March and April, the adjusted odds ratios for in-hospital death were significantly lower in May and June (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.58-0.76; P < .001), July and August (odds ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.49-0.69; P < .001), and September through November (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.47-0.73). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, high rates of in-hospital COVID-19 mortality among registry patients in March and April 2020 decreased by more than one-third by June and remained near that rate through November. This difference in mortality rates between the months of March and April and later months persisted even after adjusting for age, sex, medical history, and COVID-19 disease severity and did not appear to be associated with changes in the characteristics of patients being admitted.","Roth, Gregory A; Emmons-Bell, Sophia; Alger, Heather M; Bradley, Steven M; Das, Sandeep R; de Lemos, James A; Gakidou, Emmanuela; Elkind, Mitchell S V; Hay, Simon; Hall, Jennifer L; Johnson, Catherine O; Morrow, David A; Rodriguez, Fatima; Rutan, Christine; Shakil, Saate; Sorensen, Reed; Stevens, Laura; Wang, Tracy Y; Walchok, Jason; Williams, Joseph; Murray, Christopher",JAMA Netw Open,255,24

Herbal medicine is one type of dietary supplement that has been used for thousands of years for treatment or prophylaxis of many diseases including influenza virus infection. Although there are many previous studies about these issues, I did not find many research about using these herbs in treatment or prophylaxis of other influenza infections including H5N1, H1N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2. Objective: To collect, evaluate, and explore new important data about using medicinal herbs in these disorders' treatment or prophylaxis. Materials and Methods: I collected and explored new results and data from 24 professional health-care givers who had an experience about using these herbs in treatment or prophylaxis of these diseases. Then, I evaluated descriptively and quantitatively the results with alpha significance level ≤5% by tests such as Chi-square one-sample and reliability and validity tests. Results: The study showed many significant results about using these herbs, through using descriptive tests including one-sample Chi-square test, like in SARS-CoV-2 treatment (n = 414) with mean = 2.5870 ± 0.06730 and P &lt; 0.05, while in SARS-CoV-2, prophylaxis (n = 275) with mean = 2.1164 ± 0.06271 and P &lt; 0.05. Conclusion: This study revealed that there are some particular herbs that can be used in the treatment and prophylaxis of these diseases as adjunctives to the main typical treatment regimen, not as a monotherapy.

As new antibody tests become available, it is important to evaluate their performance and utility. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the Abbott PanbioTM COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Device against the Abbott ArchitectTM SARS CoV-2 IgG Assay for the detection of the COVID-19 IgG antibody. METHODS: Two panels of specimens were utilized to challenge both antibody tests: (1) a set of 150 prepandemic negative specimens collected in 2014, and (2) a set of 122 specimens from 87 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the US and UK that were confirmed with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test result. RESULTS: The ArchitectTM test had a specificity of 100 % and sensitivity of 99.1 % and 93.9 % when excluding or including immunocompromised patients, respectively for specimens collected >14 days post symptom onset or >5 days post-RNA testing. The PanbioTM test had 99.3 % agreement to ArchitectTM. Notably, Nâ¯=â¯6 immune-compromised individuals were identified that did not develop detectable antibodies by day 30. CONCLUSION: There is good concordance between the ArchitectTM SARS CoV-2 IgG Assay and PanbioTM COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Device for the detection of SARS CoV-2 IgG.","Batra, Rahul; Olivieri, Luis Gonzalez; Rubin, Delfin; Vallari, Ana; Pearce, Sandra; Olivo, Ana; Prostko, John; Nebbia, Gaia; Douthwaite, Sam; Rodgers, Mary; Cloherty, Gavin",J Clin Virol,255,16

In the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed whether those trained through these programmes were involved in the COVID-19 response and if so, in which area(s) of the emergency response they were applying their skills. Methods: From the records for each training programme, we identified the individuals who had completed training during the relevant timespan of each programme: 1999-2018 for the CRDF scheme, 2015-2020 for PGTS, and 2009-2019 for SORT-IT. Between March and April 2020, we sent trainees an online questionnaire by e-mail. Results: Out of 1254 trained, 1143 could be contacted and 699 responded to the survey. Of the latter, 411 were involved with the COVID-19 response, of whom 315 (77%) were applying their acquired skills in 85 countries. With some overlap between programmes, 84% of those trained through CRDF were applying their skills in 27 countries, 91% of those trained through PGTS were applying their skills in 19 countries, and through SORT IT, this was 73% in 62 countries. Skills were being applied in various areas of the emergency response, including: emergency preparedness, situation analysis/surveillance, infection control and clinical management, data generation, mitigating the effect of COVID on the health system, and research. Depending on the type of training programme, 26-74% were involved in implementation, operational or clinical research. Conclusion: Research training programmes build research capacity and equip health workers with transferable core competencies and skillsets prior to epidemics. This becomes invaluable in building health system resilience at a time of pandemics.","Zachariah, Rony; Maher, Dermot; Aseffa, Abraham; Vahedi, Mahnaz; Launois, Pascal; Khogali, Mohammed; Aslanyan, Garry; Reeder, John C",F1000Res,255,16

Design: A living, systematic review. Database: We conducted searches in the centralized repository L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L·OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from the Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L·OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customized to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. Today it is maintained through regular searches in 39 databases. Methods: We included randomized trials evaluating the effect of macrolides as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomized trials evaluating macrolides in infections caused by other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomized studies in COVID-19 were searched in case we found no direct evidence from randomized trials. Two reviewers independently screened each study for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Measures included all-cause mortality; the need for invasive mechanical ventilation; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, length of hospital stay, respiratory failure, serious adverse events, time to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negativity. We applied the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. Results: The search in the L·OVE platform retrieved 424 references. We considered 260 as potentially eligible and were reviewed in full texts. We included one randomized clinical trial that evaluated the use of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine compared to hydroxychloroquine alone in hospitalized patients with COVID 19. The estimates for all outcomes evaluated resulted in insufficient power to draw conclusions. The quality of the evidence for the main outcomes was low to very low. Conclusions: Macrolides in the management of patients with COVID 19 showed no beneficial effects compared to standard of care. The evidence for all outcomes is inconclusive. Larger trials are needed to determine the effects of macrolides on pulmonary and other outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: An observational study using data from a previous study conducted prior to the pandemic. We compared frequency of sexual intercourse, desire for pregnancy, Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score, contraception type, and menstrual abnormalities among women during the pandemic with 6-12 months prior to the pandemic. Participants were contacted by telephone for questioning. RESULTS: Average frequency of sexual intercourse was significantly increased during the pandemic compared with 6-12 months prior (2.4 vs 1.9, P=0.001). Before the pandemic 19 (32.7%) participants desired to become pregnant, whereas during the pandemic it had decreased to 3 (5.1%) (P=0.001). Conversely, use of contraception during the pandemic significantly decreased among participants compared with prior (24 vs 10, P=0.004). Menstrual disorders were more common during the pandemic than before (27.6% vs 12.1%, P=0.008). Participants had significantly better FSFI scores before the pandemic compared with scores during the pandemic (20.52 vs 17.56, P=0.001).

Partisanship was more strongly associated with physical distancing than numerous other factors, including counties' COVID-19 cases, population density, median income, and racial and age demographics. Contrary to our predictions, the observed partisan gap strengthened over time and remained when stay-at-home orders were active. Additionally, county-level consumption of conservative media (Fox News) was related to reduced physical distancing. Finally, the observed partisan differences in distancing were associated with subsequently higher COVID-19 infection and fatality growth rates in pro-Trump counties.

Currently, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as a pandemic causes greater public health concern. CoV diversity is due to the large size and replication mechanisms of the genomes together with having bats as their optimum natural hosts. The ecological behavior and unique immune characteristics of bats are optimal for the homologous recombination of CoVs. The relationship of spatial structural characteristics of the spike protein, a protein that is critical for recognition by host receptors, in different CoVs may provide evidence in explaining the coevolution of CoVs and their hosts.

Avaliação da atividade antimicrobiana de óleos essenciais frente a isolados de Staphylococcus spp. e Pasteurella spp. oriundos da cavidade bucal de gatos domésticos. 2017, 79 p. Dissertação de mestrado - Faculdade de Zootecnia e Engenharia de Alimentos, Universidade de São Paulo, Pirassununga, 2017. As afecções bucais em gatos domésticos são causas frequentes de atendimento clínico. São enfermidades multifatoriais, cuja etiopatogenia ainda não foi elucidada. Contudo, acredita-se que o desequilíbrio da microbiota bucal e da resposta imune local resulte num processo inflamatório, que a longo prazo poderá interferir no comportamento do animal, ocasionar perda de dentes e levar até a morte. A microbiota bucal é composta por diferentes gêneros bacterianos, dentre estes destacam-se Staphylococcus spp. e a Pasteurella spp. O tratamento das afecções bucais é baseado no uso de antimicrobianos e anti-inflamatórios, porém há uma alta taxa de insucesso. Adicionalmente, como a escolha dos antimicrobianos na maioria das vezes é feita de maneira empírica e indiscriminada, existe a possibilidade de surgimento de bactérias multirresistentes. Desta maneira, nos últimos anos vários esforços foram realizados com intuito de superar o advento da resistência bacteriana e os produtos naturais possuem potencial para isto, dentre estes destacam-se os óleos essenciais de plantas. Visto isso, o presente estudo objetivou isolar e identificar cepas de Staphylococcus spp. e Pasteurella spp. de amostras da cavidade bucal de gatos domésticos sadios e com gengivite. Posteriormente, os isolados foram submetidos ao teste de sensibilidade antimicrobiana frente a seis óleos essenciais (OEs): Citrus bergamia (bergamota), Anthemis nobile (camomila romana), Cymbopogon citratus (capim-limão), Copaifera officinalis (Copaiba), Eugenia caryophyllus (cravo) e Melaleuca alternifólia (tea tree ou melaleuca). Os resultados mostraram que Staphylococcus spp. e Pasteurella spp. estão presentes tanto na cavidade bucal de gatos sadios, quanto em animais com gengivite. Os OEs com melhor efetividade antimicrobiana frente a maioria dos isolados foram capim limão, cravo, melaleuca e camomila romana. Os achados obtidos no presente estudo foram similares a outras investigações anteriores. Já os OEs de copaíba e bergamota não apresentaram nenhuma ação antimicrobiana. As discrepâncias observadas podem ser explicadas, principalmente, pelas diferenças de composição química, de concentração dos compostos químicos, pelo sinergismo entre eles, pela origem fitogeográfica e condições de cultivo da planta utilizada para obtenção dos OEs.","CONTIERI, NATALIA BERTINI",,255,18

We know that the fight against the spread of the virus, when not correctly done, favours the development of variants of the original covid-19 strain and, we also know that these variants especially the one defined as the ""English"" variant, has the ability to spread much more and more quickly than the original strain. We know that people, even at lethal risk of complications, are especially old aged, but we also know that those who are oligosymptomatic or asymptomatic patients can spread the infection. Grossi E. et al. report in the following pages the results of a research conducted on pregnant women which shows how the risk of contracting the infection is higher in pregnancy although in an asymptomatic form and that the risk is also transmitted to the unborn child.

Lung transplantation is the last line of treatment for chronic end-stage lung diseases. There were several cases of lung transplantation reported in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. However, anesthetic management of lung transplantation in this subpopulation is rare. We report the anesthetic and perioperative management of lung transplantation in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. Patient concerns: A 70-year-old man with a 7-day history of fever was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. His throat swab was positive for COVID-19, but negative for other common viruses. Chest radiography showed multiple inflammatory foci in both lungs. By day 5, he presented respiratory distress. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed progressive deterioration of both lungs. Starting on day 7, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in bronchoalveolar lavage samples were continuously negative. However, his lung condition deteriorated. By day 17, a veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated. After 10 days of ECMO support, the patient's lung condition did not improve. CT scan revealed bilateral parenchymal consolidation with pulmonary fibrosis and hydrothorax. Diagnosis: Irreversible lung function loss induced by COVID-19 pneumonia. Interventions: Bilateral transplantation was performed because the patient's lung condition did not improve and CT scan revealed parenchymal consolidation with pulmonary fibrosis after 10 days of ECMO support. Thirty-six hours after the surgery, ECMO was discontinued. A percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and a stent implantation were performed because of acute coronary syndrome and myocardial ischemia 4 days postoperatively. Outcomes: The patient remained hospitalized because of requirements for intermittent assisted ventilation via tracheostomy. Lessons: This case further supports the consideration that lung transplantation can potentially be the successful therapy for these patients who have developed irreversible lung function lose due to COVID-19 pneumonia. However, most critical patients with COVID-19 are older individuals with various comorbidities, which present new anesthetic challenges.","Guo, ShaoHui Li Ang Yin PengFei Zhu ShengMei Yao YongXing",Medicine,255,11

Spreading across all regions of the world, this corona virus disease has disrupted even some of the most advanced economies and healthcare systems. With an increasing global death toll and no near end in sight, questions on the efficacy of global response mechanisms, including the role and relevancy of global health institutions, have emerged. Using a reflexive content analytic approach, this study sheds light on some of these questions, underscoring the disconnect between science, policymaking, and society. Global health funding approaches; politicization of the pandemic, including political blame gaming; mistrust of government and other institutions; and a lack of robust accountability measures are some of the pandemic response obstacles. However, COVID-19 has also presented an opportunity for a collaboration that may potentially solidify global solidarity. A pandemic response built on strategic global health diplomacy, vaccine diplomacy, and science diplomacy can spur both political and economic benefits, advancing development, health security, and justice. The virus thrives and flourishes in face of political divisions and lack of cooperation.

In the past decades, the rise of genetic-based screening methods and high-throughput sequencing approaches allowed the uncovering of unique and elusive aspects of RNA virus replication and pathogenesis at an unprecedented scale. However, viruses often hijack critical host functions or trigger pathological dysfunctions, perturbing cellular proteostasis, macromolecular complex organization or stoichiometry, and post-translational modifications. Such effects require the monitoring of proteins and proteoforms both on a global scale and at the structural level. Mass spectrometry (MS) has recently emerged as an important component of the RNA virus biology toolbox, with its potential to shed light on critical aspects of virus-host perturbations and streamline the identification of antiviral targets. Moreover, multiple novel MS tools are available to study the structure of large protein complexes, providing detailed information on the exact stoichiometry of cellular and viral protein complexes and critical mechanistic insights into their functions. Here, we review top-down and bottom-up mass spectrometry-based approaches in RNA virus biology with a special focus on the most recent developments in characterizing host responses, and their translational implications to identify novel tractable antiviral targets.","Simanjuntak, Yogy; Schamoni-Kast, Kira; Grün, Alice; Uetrecht, Charlotte; Scaturro, Pietro",Viruses,255,24

The fact that women often report a negative experience in vaginal childbirth, with physical pain and feelings of unsafety, neglect or abuse, may explain the high acceptability of elective cesarean sections. The recognition of the information needs and of the right to informed choice in childbirth can contribute to change this reality. The internet has been the main source of health information, but its quality is highly variable. OBJECTIVE: Develop and evaluate an information/communication strategy through a smartphone application about childbirth, to facilitate informed choice for access to safer and evidence-based care, in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: Randomized-controlled trial, with two arms (intervention and control), closed, blind, parallel, to be conducted in a smartphone application designed for behavior and opinion research in Brazil, with women in reproductive age previously registered in the app. After completing an entry questionnaire to verify the eligibility criteria and ethical consent, around 20,000 participants will be randomly allocated between the intervention and control groups in a 1: 1 ratio. Participants allocated to the intervention group will be invited to engage in a digital information and communication strategy, designed to expand evidence-based knowledge on the advantages and disadvantages of options in labor and birth, and safety of care processes. The information is based on the guidelines of the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization for a positive childbirth experience, and are updated to include the new challenges and disruptions in maternity care within the Covid-19 pandemic. The control group will receive information about disposable and reusable diapers as placebo intervention. The groups will be compared in their responses on a mission to prepare the birth plan, as well as in the entry and exit questionnaires, regarding answers less or more aligned with the guidelines for a positive childbirth experience. A qualitative component to map information needs is included. RESULTS: The digital trial will start recruiting participants in late October 2020 and data collection is projected to finish by December 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This study will evaluate an innovative intervention that has the potential to promote better communication between women and providers, so that they can make better choices and ensure their rights during the pandemic.

We examined the value of core surveillance system attributes to the Australian public, before and during the early stages of the current pandemic. DESIGN: A discrete choice experiment was conducted in Australia with a representative group of respondents, before and after the WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. We identified and investigated the relative importance of seven attributes associated with technologically enhanced disease surveillance: respect for personal autonomy; privacy/confidentiality; data certainty/confidence; data security; infectious disease mortality prevention; infectious disease morbidity prevention; and attribution of (causal) responsibility. Specifically, we explored how the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak influenced participant responses. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 2008 Australians (general public) completed the experiment: 793 before COVID-19 outbreak onset (mean age 45.9 years, 50.2% male) and 1215 after onset (mean age 47.2 years, 49% male). RESULTS: All seven attributes significantly influenced respondents' preferences for communicable disease surveillance systems. After onset, participants demonstrated greater preference for a surveillance system that could prevent a higher number of illnesses and deaths, and were less concerned about their personal autonomy. However, they also increased their preference for a system with high data security. CONCLUSIONS: Public acceptance of technology-based communicable disease surveillance is situation dependent. During an epidemic, there is likely to be greater tolerance of technologically enhanced disease surveillance systems that result in restrictions on personal activity if such systems can prevent high morbidity and mortality. However, this acceptance of lower personal autonomy comes with an increased requirement to ensure data security. These findings merit further research as the pandemic unfolds and strategies are put in place that enable individuals and societies to live with SARS-CoV-2 endemicity.","Degeling, Chris; Chen, Gang; Gilbert, Gwendolyn L; Brookes, Victoria; Thai, Thi; Wilson, Andrew; Johnson, Jane",BMJ Open,255,12

Heparin (delivered systemically) is currently used to treat anticoagulant anomalies in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, in the United Kingdom, Brazil and Australia, nebulised unfractionated heparin (UFH) is being trialled in COVID-19 patients as a potential treatment. A systematic comparison of the potential antiviral effect of various heparin preparations on live wild type SARS-CoV-2, in vitro, is needed. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Seven different heparin preparations including UFH and low MW heparins (LMWH) of porcine or bovine origin were screened for antiviral activity against live SARS-CoV-2 (Australia/VIC01/2020) using a plaque inhibition assay with Vero E6 cells. Interaction of heparin with spike protein RBD was studied using differential scanning fluorimetry and the inhibition of RBD binding to human ACE2 protein using elisa assays was examined. KEY RESULTS: All the UFH preparations had potent antiviral effects, with IC50 values ranging between 25 and 41 µg·ml-1 , whereas LMWHs were less inhibitory by ~150-fold (IC50 range 3.4-7.8 mg·ml-1 ). Mechanistically, we observed that heparin binds and destabilizes the RBD protein and furthermore, we show heparin directly inhibits the binding of RBD to the human ACE2 protein receptor. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This comparison of clinically relevant heparins shows that UFH has significantly stronger SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity compared to LMWHs. UFH acts to directly inhibit binding of spike protein to the human ACE2 protein receptor. Overall, the data strongly support further clinical investigation of UFH as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19.","Tree, Julia A; Turnbull, Jeremy E; Buttigieg, Karen R; Elmore, Michael J; Coombes, Naomi; Hogwood, John; Mycroft-West, Courtney J; Lima, Marcelo A; Skidmore, Mark A; Karlsson, Richard; Chen, Yen-Hsi; Yang, Zhang; Spalluto, Cosma Mirella; Staples, Karl J; Yates, Edwin A; Gray, Elaine; Singh, Dave; Wilkinson, Tom; Page, Clive P; Carroll, Miles W",,255,23

These variants frequently hold mutations on the Spike protein's receptor-binding domain (RBD), which, binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, mediates viral entry into host cells. Here, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and dynamical network theory of the wild-type and mutant RBD/ACE2 adducts disclose that while the N501Y mutation (UK variant) enhances the Spike's binding affinity toward ACE2, the concomitant N501Y, E484K, and K417N mutations (South African variant) aptly adapt to increase SARS-CoV-2 propagation via a two-pronged strategy: (i) effectively grasping ACE2 through an allosteric signaling between pivotal RBD structural elements and (ii) impairing the binding of antibodies elicited by infected or vaccinated patients. This information unlocks the molecular terms and evolutionary strategies underlying the increased virulence of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, setting the basis for developing the next-generation anti-COVID-19 therapeutics.","Spinello, Angelo; Saltalamacchia, Andrea; Borisek, Jure; Magistrato, Alessandra",J Phys Chem Lett,255,23

Risk for suffering COVID-19 was evaluated by Cox regression, estimating multivariable HRs adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities and medications use. RESULTS: During the study period, 2324 cohort members were PCR-tested, with 1944 negative and 380 positive results, which means an incidence of 480.5 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100 000 persons-period. Assessing the total study cohort, only age (HR 1.02; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.03; p=0.002), nursing-home residence (HR 21.83; 95% CI 16.66 to 28.61; p<0.001) and receiving diuretics (HR 1.35; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.76; p=0.026) appeared independently associated with increased risk. Smoking (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.93; p=0.022), ACE inhibitors (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.99; p=0.046) and antihistamine (HR 0.47; 95% CI 0.22 to 1.01; p=0.052) were associated with a lower risk. Among community-dwelling individuals, cancer (HR 1.52; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.24; p=0.035), chronic respiratory disease (HR 1.82; 95% CI 1.08 to 3.07; p=0.025) and cardiac disease (HR 1.53; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.19; p=0.021) emerged to be also associated with an increased risk. Receiving ACE inhibitors (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.99; p=0.046) and influenza vaccination (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.91; p=0.012) was associated with decreased risk. CONCLUSION: Age, nursing-home residence and multiple comorbidities appear predisposing for COVID-19. Conversely, receiving ACE inhibitors, antihistamine and influenza vaccination could be protective, which should be closely investigated in further studies specifically focused on these concerns.","Vila-Córcoles, Angel; Ochoa-Gondar, Olga; Satué-Gracia, Eva M; Torrente-Fraga, Cristina; Gomez-Bertomeu, Frederic; Vila-Rovira, Angel; Hospital-Guardiola, Immaculada; de Diego-Cabanes, Cinta; Bejarano-Romero, Ferran; Basora-Gallisà, Josep",BMJ Open,255,16

In the ensuing months it has been transmitted worldwide. Here the authors present the current knowledge on the epidemiology of this virus. SARS-CoV­2 replicates mainly in the upper and lower respiratory tract and is primarily transmitted by droplets from asymptomatic and symptomatic infected subjects. The estimate for the basic reproduction number (R) is currently between 2 and 3, while the incubation period is 6 (median, range 2-14) days. Although most infections are uncomplicated, 5-10% of cases develop pneumonia, which can lead to hospitalization, respiratory failure and multiorgan failure. Risk factors for a complicated disease course include age, hypertension, chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary disease and immunodeficiency. The overall case fatality rate is 1.4%, with the rate rising in the sixth decade of life. Nosocomial and infections in medical personnel have been reported. Drastic reductions in social contact have been implemented in many countries with outbreaks of SARS-CoV­2, leading to rapid reductions in R.

Yet, cost-effective remediation technologies have been lacking. In this study, we prepared a type of FeSx based on commercial FeSO4.7H2O and CaSx and tested a microwave-assisted technology based on FeSx for reductive immobilization of high concentrations of Cr(VI) in a field contaminated soil. The as-prepared FeSx particles appeared as a honeycomb-like and highly porous structure. The microwave-assisted FeSx reduction process was able to rapidly reduce the TCLP-based reachability of Cr(VI) from 391.8 to 2.6 mg·L-1. The dosage of FeSx, S/Fe molar ratio, initial moisture content, microwave power, and irradiation time can all affect the treatment effectiveness. After 500 days curing under atmospheric conditions, the TCLP-leached concentration of Cr remained below the regulatory limit of 5 mg·L-1, while other treatments failed to meet the goal. Sx2- or S2- served as the primary electron donors, whereas Fe facilitated the microwave absorption and the formation of the stable final product of FeCr2O4. S and Fe are mostly precipitated in soil. The microwave-assisted FeSx reduction was shown to be an effective approach to rapidly reduce the leachability of Cr(VI) in contaminated soil, especially in heavily contaminated soil.","Wang, Jianle; Liu, Xueming; Zhu, Zhihua; Yuan, Le; Zhao, Dongye; Deng, Hong; Lin, Zhang",J Hazard Mater,255,28

In recent disasters, numerous hospitals were damaged, and this hampered the recovery of the affected communities. Had these hospitals business continuity plans (BCPs) to recover quickly after the disaster, most of the damage could have been avoided. This study conducted a scoping review of the historical trend and regional differences in hospital BCPs to validate the improvement of the BCP concept based on our own experience at Tohoku University Hospital, which was affected by the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami (GEJET). We searched PubMed by using keywords related to BCP and adapted 97 articles for our analysis. The number of articles on hospital BCPs has increased in the 2000s, especially after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. While there are regional specificity of hazards, there were many common topics and visions for BCP implementation, education, and drills. From our 2011 GEJET experience, we found that BCPs assuming region-specific disasters are applicable in various types of disasters. Thus, we suggest the following integral and universal components for hospital BCPs: (1) alternative methods and resources, (2) priority of operation, and (3) resource management. Even if the type and extent of disasters vary, the development of BCPs and business continuity management strategies that utilize the abovementioned integral components can help a hospital survive disasters in the future.","Sasaki, Hiroyuki; Maruya, Hiroaki; Abe, Yoshiko; Fujita, Motoo; Furukawa, Hajime; Fuda, Mikiko; Kamei, Takashi; Yaegashi, Nobuo; Tominaga, Teiji; Egawa, Shinichi",Tohoku J Exp Med,255,29

The level of impact on the mental health of orthodontic patients in treatment is unknown. The objective of the study was to evaluate the mental health of orthodontic patients in China during the early stage of the pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was conducted on a convenience sample of anonymous participants. The questionnaire, in Chinese (Mandarin), comprised 5 sections. Sections 1-3 included demographic, epidemical, and orthodontic status of the patients. Section 4 assessed mental health-related to orthodontics. Section 5 was the Kessler-10 Mental Distress Scale. A total of 48 orthodontists were invited to distribute the questionnaires to their patients. Descriptive statistics, principal component analysis, K-means cluster analysis, and bivariate logistics regression analysis were performed with significance set at P <0.05. RESULTS: Questionnaires were collected from 558 patients (104 males, 354 females; mean age 24.78 ± 6.33 years). The prevalence of mental distress was 38% (174/458). Higher odds ratios were associated with female participants, missed appointments, and Hubei residence. The type of orthodontic appliance was associated with the anxiety of prolonged treatment duration. The manner of communication with patients regarding the postponement of appointments was associated with patients' concerns of prolonged treatment duration. The frequency of contact from dentists was associated with patients' independence. CONCLUSIONS: Over one-third of orthodontic patients experienced mental distress during the pandemic. Multiple factors affected the level of anxiety of orthodontic patients, such as the type of orthodontic appliance, time since last dental visit, manner of communication with the orthodontist, and the localities of the pandemic progression.","Xiong, Xin; Wu, Yange; Fang, Xinyi; Sun, Wei; Ding, Qin; Yi, Yating; Huang, Yanmei; Gong, Jinglei; Liu, Jin; Wang, Jun",Am. j. orthod. dentofacial orthop,255,16

The spread of COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the human mobility patterns such as daily transportation-related behavior of the public. There is a requirement to understand the disease spread patterns and its routes among neighboring individuals for the timely implementation of corrective measures at the required placement. To increase the effectiveness of contact tracing, countries across the globe are leveraging advancements in mobile technology and Internet of Things (IoT) to aid traditional manual contact tracing to track individuals who have come in close contact with identified COVID-19 patients. Even as the first administration of vaccines begins in 2021, the COVID-19 management strategy will continue to be multi-pronged for the foreseeable future with digital contact tracing being a vital component of the response along with the use of preventive measures such as social distancing and the use of face masks. After some months of deployment of digital contact tracing technology, deeper insights into the merits of various approaches and the usability, privacy, and ethical trade-offs involved are emerging. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of digital contact tracing solutions in terms of their methodologies and technologies in the light of the new data emerging about international experiences of deployments of digital contact tracing technology. We also provide a discussion on open challenges such as scalability, privacy, adaptability and highlight promising directions for future work.","Shahroz, Muhammad Ahmad Farooq Younis Muhammad Shahzad Ahmad Nadeem Kamel Boulos Maged N.; Vinuesa, Ricardo Qadir Junaid",Transportation Engineering,255,16

We learned that both SARS and COVID-19 patients had thyroid abnormalities. In the limited number of SARS cases, where it was examined, decreased serum T3, T4 and TSH levels were detected. In a study of survivors of SARS approximately 7% of the patients had hypothyroidism. In the previous evaluation evidence was found that pituitary function was also affected in SARS. Others suggested a hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction. One result published recently indicates that a primary injury to the thyroid gland itself may play a key role in the pathogenesis of thyroid disorders in COVID-19 patients, too. Subacute thyroiditis, autoimmune thyroiditis and an atypical form of thyroiditis are complications of COVID-19. Thyroid hormone dysfunction affects the outcome by increasing mortality in critical illnesses like acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is a leading complication in COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a membrane-bound enzyme, which is also expressed in the thyroid gland and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses it for docking, entering as well as replication. Based on the available results obtained in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, beside others, we suggest that it is necessary to monitor thyroid hormones in COVID-19.","Speer, Gábor; Somogyi, Péter",Endocr. j,255,12

We derive analytical expressions for the probability of containment of the outbreak, which is complementary to the probability of seeding a deterministically growing epidemic. This probability depends on the statistics of the intra-community contact network and the initial conditions, in particular, on the contact degree of patient zero. Based on this model, we suggest surveillance protocols by which individuals are tested proportionally to their degree in the contact network.

A reduction in the quality of life and the presence of prolonged fatigue are some of the most imminent problems that emerge among these professionals. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a holistic intervention (workshop) for health science students aimed at developing skills that will enable them to obtain a better self-assessment of their quality of life, and prolonged fatigue. Methods: Pre- and post-measures of quality of life, and prolonged fatigue were obtained from 130 health science students, including a group of 96 attendees (cases) of a 4-h wellness workshop and 34 students who did not attend (controls). Results: Paired t tests indicated a significant improvement in nearly all dimensions related to quality of life, and prolonged fatigue in the case group who attended the workshop. Conclusions: A comprehensive wellness strategy that utilizes a holistic approach can play an important role in improving and promoting essential skills to improve healthcare provider's self-assessment about the quality of life and reduce their prolonged fatigue.

SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect multiple organ systems, including the digestive tract. Little is known about the consequences of COVID-19 infection in emergency surgical patients. METHODS: Perioperative data for COVID-19 patients undergoing emergency surgery from March 1, 2020, to May 23, 2020 were collected prospectively (NCT04323644). RESULTS: During this period, 215 patients underwent surgery, including 127 patients in an emergency setting, of whom 13 (10.2%) had COVID-19. Two scenarios were identified: (a) patients who were admitted to a hospital for an acute surgical condition with a concomitant diagnosis of COVID-19, and (b) patients with severe COVID-19 developing acute abdominal pathologies during their hospital stay. When compared with those in group B, patients in group A globally recovered better, with a lower mortality rate (14.3% vs. 33.3%), lower ARDS rate (28.5% vs. 50.0%), less rates of preoperative invasive ventilation (14.3% vs. 50.0%) and postoperative invasive ventilation (28.5% vs. 100.0%), and a shorter duration of invasive ventilation. No causality between SARS-CoV-2 infection and gastrointestinal affliction was found. CONCLUSION: Our observations underline that mild co-infection with COVID-19 did not result in more complications for emergency abdominal surgery.

To design a prevention and control strategy for this new infectious disease, it is essential to first understand people’s knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding COVID-19. This study sought to determine KAP among rural and urban residents as well as predictors of preventive practices associated with COVID-19 in Bangladesh. A social media-based (Facebook) cross-sectional survey was conducted to explore these variables among Bangladeshi adults. Of 1520 respondents who completed the questionnaire, low level of good or sufficient knowledge of COVID-19 (70.8%) and practices associated with COVID-19 (73.8%) were found. Despite the low level of knowledge and practices, respondents’ attitude (78.9%) towards COVID-19 was relatively high. Results suggest that compared to urban, rural residents are at a particularly high risk of COVID-19 because they were found to have significantly lower knowledge (p = 0.001) and practice levels (p = 0.002) than were urban residents. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified gender, education, knowledge of COVID-19 transmission, signs and symptoms, and sources of information as factors significantly associated with preventive practices against COVID-19. Further attention and effort should be directed toward increasing both knowledge and practices targeting the general population in Bangladesh, particularly the rural and less educated residents. Findings from this study provide baseline data that can be used to promote integrated awareness of and effective health education programs about COVID-19 prevention and control strategies in Bangladesh, and similar COVID-19 endemic countries.","Rahman, Md Siddikur Karamehic-Muratovic Ajlina Amrin Miftahuzzannat Arman Hossain Chowdhury Md Selim Mondol Haque Ubydul Parveen Ali",Epidemiologia,255,19

Reply,16.003704,7.240339,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine the associations of BMI with testing positive for severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and risk of adverse outcomes in a cohort of Veterans Affairs enrollees. METHOD: Adjusted relative risks/hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for the associations between BMI category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, class 1 obesity, class 2 obesity, and class 3 obesity) and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 or experiencing hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and death among those testing positive. RESULTS: Higher BMI categories were associated with higher risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test compared with the normal weight category (class 3 obesity adjusted relative risk: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.28-1.42). Among 25,952 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, class 3 obesity was associated with higher risk of mechanical ventilation (adjusted HR [aHR]: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.35-2.32) and mortality (aHR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.12-1.78) compared with normal weight individuals. These associations were present primarily in patients younger than 65 and were attenuated or absent in older age groups (interaction P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Veterans Affairs enrollees with higher BMI were more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were more likely to be mechanically ventilated or die if infected with SARS-CoV-2. Higher BMI contributed relatively more to the risk of death in those younger than 65 years of age as compared with other age categories.","Eastment, McKenna C; Berry, Kristin; Locke, Emily; Green, Pamela; O039,; Hare, Ann; Crothers, Kristina; Dominitz, Jason A; Fan, Vincent S; Shah, Javeed A; Ioannou, George N",Obesity (Silver Spring),255,26

BACKGROUND: Our diffuse primary care network had no existing model of care by which to provide coordinated result tracking and monitoring of outpatients with COVID-19. DESIGN: Quality improvement implementation project. METHODS: We used the Replicating Effective Programs model to guide implementation, iterative Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles and SQUIRE reporting guidelines. Two transitional care registered nurses, and a geriatrician medical director developed a protocol that included detailed initial assessment, overnight delivery of monitoring equipment and phone-based follow-up tailored to risk level and symptom severity. We tripled programme capacity in time for the surge of cases by training Primary Care registered nurses. RESULTS: Between 23 March and 15 May 2020, 120 Veterans with COVID-19 were enrolled for outpatient monitoring; over one-third were aged 65 years or older, and 70% had medical conditions associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes. All Veterans received an initial call within a few hours of the laboratory reporting positive results. The mean length of follow-up was 8.1 days, with an average of 4.2 nurse and 1.3 physician or advanced practice clinician contacts per patient. The majority (85%) were managed entirely in the outpatient setting. After the surge, the model was disseminated to individual primary care teams through educational sessions.

Remdesivir (RDV), a prodrug and requires intracellular conversions to the active triphosphate nucleoside (TN) has surfaced as an active anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug. To properly design therapeutic treatment regimens, it is imperative to determine if adequate intracellular TN concentrations are achieved in target tissues, such as the lung. Since measurement of such concentrations is unrealistic in patients, a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model (PBPK) model was developed to characterize RDV and TN disposition. Specifically, a hybrid PBPK model was developed based on previously reported data in humans The model represented each tissue as a 2-compartment model - both extracellular and intracellular compartment wherein each intracellular compartment contained a comprehensive metabolic model to the ultimate active metabolite TN. Global sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to assess which parameters and how highly sensitive ones impacted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMNCs) and intracellular lung TN profiles. Finally, clinical multiple-dose regimens indicated that minimum lung intracellular TN concentrations ranged from approximately 9 uM to 4 uM, which suggest current regimens are effective based on in vitro EC50 values. The model can be used to explore tissue drug disposition under various conditions and regimens, and expanded to pharmacodynamic models.","Gallo, James M",Clinical and translational science (Online),255,20

(MA) roots are needed as the source of active stilbenes in the industrial production of traditional medicines and cosmeceuticals. A recent investigation demonstrated resveratrol and its derivatives to be promising anti-COVID-19 agents. However, conventional cultivation of MA does not meet the demand for its stilbenes, and root quality usually varies between crops. This study established the in vitro non-GMO root culture of MA and optimized the root density, precursor feeding, and elicitors for stilbene productivity. A root culture with optimal inoculum density (3 g/flask of 30 mL medium) accumulated mulberroside A, oxyresveratrol, and resveratrol at 18.7 ± 1.00 mg/g, 136 ± 5.05 µg/g, and 41.6 ± 5.84 µg/g dry weight (DW), respectively. The feeding of L-tyrosine shortened the time required to reach the stilbene productive stage. Root cultures co-treated with 200 µM methyl jasmonate and 2 mg/mL yeast extract accumulated the highest contents of mulberroside A (30.3 ± 2.68 mg/g DW), oxyresveratrol (68.6 ± 3.53 µg/g DW), and resveratrol (10.2 ± 0.53 µg/g DW). In summary, root culture is a promising and sustainable source of stilbenes for the development of health products and agents for further investigation as potential anti-COVID-19 agents.","Inyai, Chadathorn; Yusakul, Gorawit; Komaikul, Jukrapun; Kitisripanya, Tharita; Likhitwitayawuid, Kittisak; Sritularak, Boonchoo; Putalun, Waraporn",,255,16

The purpose of this study was to quantify the change in the composition of inpatient imaging volumes for modality types and Current Procedural Terminology-coded groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective study of inpatient imaging volumes in a large health care system was performed, analyzing weekly imaging volumes by modality types (radiography, CT, MRI, ultrasound, interventional radiology, nuclear medicine) in years 2020 and 2019. The data set was split to compare pre-COVID-19 (weeks 1-9) and post-COVID-19 (weeks 10-16) periods. Further subanalyses compared early post-COVID-19 (weeks 10-13) and late post-COVID-19 (weeks 14-16) periods. Statistical comparisons were performed using &#967;2 and independent-samples t tests. RESULTS: Compared with 2019, total inpatient imaging volume in 2020 post-COVID-19, early and late post-COVID-19 periods, declined by 13.6% (from 78,902 to 68,168), 16.6% (from 45,221 to 37,732), and 9.6% (from 33,681 to 30,436), respectively. By week 16, inpatient imaging volume rebounded and was only down 4.2% (from 11,003 to 10,546). However, a statistically significant shift (P < .0001) in the 2020 composition mix was observed largely comprised of radiography (74.3%), followed by CT (12.7%), ultrasound (8%), MRI (2.4%), interventional radiology (2.3%), and nuclear medicine (0.4%). Although the vast majority of imaging studies declined, few Current Procedural Terminology-coded groups showed increased trends in imaging volumes in the late post-COVID-19 period, including CT angiography chest, radiography chest, and ultrasound venous duplex. DISCUSSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a decrease in inpatient imaging volumes accompanied by a shift away from cross-sectional imaging toward radiography. These findings could have significant implications in planning for a potential resurgence.","Naidich, Jason J; Boltyenkov, Artem; Wang, Jason J; Chusid, Jesse; Hughes, Danny; Sanelli, Pina C",J Am Coll Radiol,255,5

Advancements in technology (e.g., digital devices and mHealth) enrich our ability to collect social networks and health data. The purpose of this scoping review was to identify and map the use of technology in measuring older adults' social networks for health and social care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Joanna Briggs Institute methodology was followed. PubMed (MEDLINE), Sociological Abstracts, SocINDEX, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched for relevant articles. Conference abstracts and proceedings were searched via Conference Papers Index, the American Sociological Society, and The Gerontological Society of America. Studies published in English from January 2004 to March 2020 that aimed to improve health or social care for older adults and used technology to measure social networks were included. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers using an a priori extraction tool. RESULTS: The majority of the 18 reviewed studies were pilot or simulation research conducted in Europe that focused on older adults living in the community. The various types of technologies used can be categorized as environment-based, person-based, and data-based. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Technology facilitates objective and longitudinal data collection on the social interactions and activities of older adults. The use of technology to measure older adults' social networks, however, is primarily in an exploratory phase.

Older adults, which frequently present multiple chronic comorbidities, are more susceptible to COVID-19 and experience more likely negative outcomes, in terms of disease severity and mortality. However, chronological age per se may not entirely explain the dramatic scenario described among the frailest and oldest persons. Comorbidities and functional status may indeed play a relevant role. Patients at high risk of adverse clinical outcomes in COVID-19 infection are the same at risk of malnutrition, namely older adults and multimorbid individuals. In fact, COVID-19 can negatively impact on nutritional status, both in patients admitted to the hospital with the most severe manifestations of the infection, as well as in those who experience milder/asymptomatic forms of the disease. Despite being quite difficult in these emergency circumstances, nutritional status needs to be assessed in all COVID-19 patients upon admission and during hospital stay.

METHODS: Patients' self-reports of current gout flares were assessed with the question, 'Are you having a gout flare today?' which was then compared with a concurrent, blinded, physician's assessment. Based on agreement or disagreement with physicians on the presence of a gout flare, flares were divided into concordant and discordant groups, respectively. Within the discordant group, two subgroups-patient-reported flare but the physician disagreed and physician-reported flare but the patient disagreed-were identified. The factors associated with discordance were analysed with multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 268 gout flares, 81 (30.2%) flares were discordant, with either patient or physician disagreeing on the presence of a flare. Of the discordant flares, in 57 (70.4%) the patient reported a flare but the physician disagreed. In multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for demographics, disagreement among patients and physicians on the presence of a gout flare was associated with lower pain scores at rest [odds ratio (OR) for each point increase on 0-10 point pain scale 0.81 (95% Wald CI 0.73, 0.90), P < 0.0001] and less presence of joint swelling [OR 0.24 (95% CI 0.10, 0.61), P = 0.003] or joint warmth [OR 0.39 (95% CI 0.20, 0.75), P = 0.005]. CONCLUSION: Although patients and physicians generally agree about the presence of gout flare, discordance may occur in the setting of low pain scores and in the absence of swollen or warm joints.","Jagpal, Aprajita; Rahn, Elizabeth J; Mudano, Amy S; Dalbeth, Nicola; Taylor, William; Saag, Kenneth G; Singh, Jasvinder A; Cavagna, Lorenzo; Uhlig, Till; Perez-Ruiz, Fernando; McCarthy, Geraldine; Gerritsen, Martijn; Stamp, Lisa; Vazquez Mellado, Janitzia; Lin, Chingtsai; Vargas-Santos, Ana Beatriz; Louthrenoo, Worawit; Neogi, Tuhina; Chen, Yi-Hsing; Castelar-Pinheiro, Geraldo da Rocha; Gaffo, Angelo",Rheumatology (Oxford),255,21

D-dimer is a product that is a part of fibrin abasement, which can be used as a test for the diagnosis of thrombotic disorders. Higher D-dimer levels are a strong indicator of mortality in patients with active COVID-19. This study aimed to determine the relationship between D-dimer levels and the clinical prognosis of COVID-19 patients. This observational, prospective study was conducted between April 2020 and September 2020. All patients with COVID-19 infection were considered for this study, along with their D-dimer values. Patients with higher D-dimer levels and pre-existing morbidities experienced a longer hospital stay and increased complications when compared to patients without pre-existing morbidities. Abnormally elevated D-dimer levels were frequently observed upon admission due to COVID-19 and are analogous to the increased occurrence of critical illness, thrombotic events, acute kidney injury, and death. Therefore, D-dimer levels could be a valuable clinical biomarker and an important indicator of prognosis for patients with COVID-19 with pre-existing morbidities.

In many cases, due to lockdowns or analytical delays, the analysis of wastewater samples might only be possible after prolonged storage. In this study, the effect of storage conditions on the RNA copy numbers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewater influent was studied and compared to the persistence of norovirus over time at 4 °C, -20 °C, and -75 °C using the reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays E-Sarbeco, N2, and norovirus GII. For the first time in Finland, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was tested in 24 h composite influent wastewater samples collected from Viikinmäki wastewater treatment plant, Helsinki, Finland. The detected and quantified SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers of the wastewater sample aliquots taken during 19-20 April 2020 and stored for 29, 64, and 84 days remained surprisingly stable. In the stored samples, the SARS betacoronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 copy numbers, but not the norovirus GII copy numbers, seemed slightly higher when analyzed from the pre-centrifuged pellet-that is, the particulate matter of the influent-as compared with the supernatant (i.e., water fraction) used for ultrafiltration, although the difference was not statistically significant. Furthermore, when wastewater was spiked with SARS-CoV-2, linear decay at 4 °C was observed on the first 28 days, while no decay was visible within 58 days at -20 °C or -75 °C. In conclusion, freezing temperatures should be used for storage when immediate SARS-CoV-2 RNA analysis from the wastewater influent is not possible. Analysis of the particulate matter of the sample, in addition to the water fraction, can improve the detection frequency.","Hokajärvi, Anna-Maria; Rytkönen, Annastiina; Tiwari, Ananda; Kauppinen, Ari; Oikarinen, Sami; Lehto, Kirsi-Maarit; Kankaanpää, Aino; Gunnar, Teemu; Al-Hello, Haider; Blomqvist, Soile; Miettinen, Ilkka T; Savolainen-Kopra, Carita; Pitkänen, Tarja",Sci Total Environ,255,1

Of 437 Americans and their travel companions on the ship, 114 (26%) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We interviewed 229 American passengers and crew after disembarkation following a ship-based quarantine to identify risk factors for infection and characterize transmission onboard the ship. RESULTS: The attack rate for passengers in single-person cabins or without infected cabinmates was 18% (58/329), compared with 63% (27/43) for those sharing a cabin with an asymptomatic infected cabinmate, and 81% (25/31) for those with a symptomatic infected cabinmate. Whole genome sequences from specimens from passengers who shared cabins clustered together. Of 66 SARS-CoV-2-positive American travelers with complete symptom information, 14 (21%) were asymptomatic while on the ship. Among SARS-CoV-2-positive Americans, 10 (9%) required intensive care, of whom 7 were &#8805;70 years. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on cruise ships. High rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in cabinmates of individuals with asymptomatic infections suggest that triage by symptom status in shared quarters is insufficient to halt transmission. A high rate of intensive care unit admission among older individuals complicates the prospect of future cruise travel during the pandemic, given typical cruise passenger demographics. The magnitude and severe outcomes of this outbreak were major factors contributing to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's decision to halt cruise ship travel in U.S. waters in March 2020.","Plucinski, Mateusz M; Wallace, Megan; Uehara, Anna; Kurbatova, Ekaterina V; Tobolowsky, Farrell A; Schneider, Zachary D; Ishizumi, Atsuyoshi; Bozio, Catherine H; Kobayashi, Miwako; Toda, Mitsuru; Stewart, Andrea; Wagner, Riley L; Moriarty, Leah F; Murray, Rachel; Queen, Krista; Tao, Ying; Paden, Clinton; Mauldin, Matthew R; Zhang, Jing; Li, Yan; Elkins, Christopher A; Lu, Xiaoyan; Herzig, Carolyn T A; Novak, Ryan; Bower, William; Medley, Alexandra M; Acosta, Anna M; Knust, Barbara; Cantey, Paul T; Pesik, Nicki T; Halsey, Eric S; Cetron, Martin S; Tong, Suxiang; Marston, Barbara J; Friedman, Cindy R",Clin. infect. dis,255,16

As states start lifting these mandates to reopen the economy, voluntary public compliance with public health recommendations may significantly influence the extent of resurgence in COVID-19 infection rates. Population-level risk from reopening may therefore be predicted from public intent to comply with public health recommendations. We are conducting a global, convergent design mixed-methods survey on public knowledge, perceptions, preferred health information sources, and understanding of and intent to comply with public health recommendations. With over 9,000 completed surveys from every US state and over 70 countries worldwide, to our knowledge this is the largest pandemic messaging study to date.

It has been known since the 2003 SARS epidemic that the receptor critical for SARS-CoV entry into host cells is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S1 domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV attaches the virus to its cellular receptor ACE2 on the host cells.

Serology, which detects the host antibody response to the infection, is the most appropriate tool for this task, since virus-derived markers are most reliably detected during the acute phase of infection. Here we show that our ELISA protocol, which is based on antibody binding to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the viral Spike protein expressed as a novel fusion protein, detects antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination. We also show that our ELISA is accurate and versatile. It compares favorably with commercial assays widely used in clinical practice to determine exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our protocol accommodates use of various blood- and non-blood-derived biospecimens, such as breast milk, as well as dried blood obtained with microsampling cartridges that are appropriate for remote collection. As a result, our RBD-based ELISA protocols are well suited for seroepidemiology and other large-scale studies requiring parsimonious sample collection outside of healthcare settings.","Datta, Pratik; Ukey, Rahul; Bruiners, Natalie; Honnen, William; Caryannopoulos, Mary O; Reichman, Charles; Choudhary, Alok K; Onyuka, Alberta; Handler, Deborah; Guerrini, Valentina; Mishra, Pankaj; Dewald, Hannah K; Lardizabal, Alfred; Lederer, Leeba; Leiser, Aliza L; Hussain, Sabiha; Jagpal, Sugeet K; Radbel, Jared; Bhowmick, Tanaya; Horton, Daniel B; Barrett, Emily S; Xie, Yingda L; Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, Patricia; Weiss, Stanley H; Woortman, Melissa; Parmar, Heta; Roy, Jason; Dominguez-Bello, Maria Gloria; Blaser, Martin; Carson, Jeffrey L; Panettieri, Reynold A; Libutti, Steven K; Raymond, Henry F; Pinter, Abraham; Gennaro, Maria Laura",,255,16

Clinical information, laboratory tests, and chest computed tomography (CT) scans at admission were collected. Two experienced radiologists reviewed the scans for the patterns, distribution, and CT scores of lung abnormalities. Six machine learning models were established to predict the severity of COVID-19. After parameter tuning and performance comparison, the optimal model was explained using Shapley Additive explanations to output the crucial factors. This study enrolled and classified 198 patients into mild (n = 162; 46.93 ± 14.49 years old) and severe (n = 36; 60.97 ± 15.91 years old) groups. The severe group had a higher temperature (37.42 ± 0.99°C vs. 36.75 ± 0.66°C), CT score at admission, neutrophil count, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio than the mild group. The XGBoost model ranked first among all models, with an AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.924, 90.91%, and 97.96%, respectively. The early stage of chest CT, total CT score of the percentage of lung involvement, and age were the top three contributors to the prediction of the deterioration of XGBoost. A higher total score on chest CT had a more significant impact on the prediction. In conclusion, the XGBoost model to predict the severity of COVID-19 achieved excellent performance and output the essential factors in the deterioration process, which may help with early clinical intervention, improve prognosis, and reduce mortality.","Zheng, Bowen; Cai, Yong; Zeng, Fengxia; Lin, Min; Zheng, Jun; Chen, Weiguo; Qin, Genggeng; Guo, Yi",Biomed Res Int,255,20

Reinforcement and lamination of the aligned nanofibers generates mechanically robust structures that retain very high porosity and low tortuosity when applied to high pressure desalination operations. The cross-hatched nanofiber layers support the polyamide active layer firmly and reduce resistance to water flow due to the high porosity, low tortuosity, high mechanical strength, and minimal thickness of the structures. The nanofiber composite membrane gives a water flux significantly greater than when a traditional support layer is used, at 99 ± 5 m-2 h-1 with NaCl rejection of 98.7% at 15.5 bar.","Kim, Seungju; Heath, Daniel E; Kentish, Sandra E",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),255,1

Extensive contract tracing during the outbreak has resulted in a dataset of epidemiologically linked cases. This data contains useful information about the transmission dynamics of the virus, its dependence on factors such as age, and its response to different control measures. We use Monte-Carlo network construction techniques to provide an estimate of the number of secondary cases for every individual infected during the outbreak. We then apply standard statistical techniques to quantify differences between groups of individuals. Children under 10 years old are significantly under-represented in the case data. Children infected fewer people on average and had a lower probability of transmitting the disease in comparison to adults and the elderly. Imported cases infected fewer people on average and also had a lower probability of transmitting than domestically acquired cases. Superspreading is a significant contributor to the epidemic dynamics, with 20% of cases among adults responsible for 65-85% of transmission.

In this study, we designed a new type of cannulated screws called degradable magnesium alloy bionic cannulated screws (DMBCS) and our aim was to compare the biomechanical properties of DMBCS, the traditionally used titanium alloy bionic cannulated screws (TBCS) and titanium alloy cannulated screws (TTCS). METHODS: A proximal femur model was established based on CT data of a lower extremity from a voluntary healthy man. Garden type III femoral neck fracture was constructed and fixed with DMBCS, TBCS, and TTCS, respectively. Biomechanical effect which three type of CS models have on femoral neck fracture was evaluated and compared using von Mises stress distribution and displacement. RESULTS: In the normal model, the maximum stress value of cortical bone and cancellous bone was 76.18 and 6.82 MPa, and the maximum displacement was 5.52 mm. Under 3 different fracture healing status, the stress peak value of the cortical bone and cancellous bone in the DMBCS fixation model was lower than that in the TTCS and TBCS fixation, while the maximum displacement of DMBCS fixation model was slightly higher than that of TTCS and TBCS fixation models. As the fracture heals, stress peak value of the screws and cortical bone of intact models are decreasing, while stress peak value of cancellous bone is increasing initially and then decreasing. CONCLUSIONS: The DMBCS exhibits the superior biomechanical performance than TTCS and TBCS, whose fixation model is closest to the normal model in stress distribution. DMBCS is expected to reduce the rates of post-operative complications with traditional internal fixation and provide practical guidance for the structural design of CS for clinical applications.","Ding, Kai; Yang, Weijie; Zhu, Jian; Cheng, Xiaodong; Wang, Haicheng; Hao, Du; Yinuo, Song; Zhu, Yanbin; Zhang, Yingze; Chen, Wei; Zhang, Qi",J Orthop Surg Res,255,1

However, prolonged lockdown can lead to negative consequences in terms of mental health. The goal of the research is to examine the relationship between anxiety and general psychosomatic functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic; the impact of psychological flexibility and mindfulness is also considered. Variables were measured with self-report questionnaires and symptom checklists. The sample included 170 people (M = 27.79, SD = 8.16). Pearson's correlation, stepwise regression, and path analysis were conducted. The results showed a significant positive relationship between state anxiety and somatic and psychological responses to the pandemic. Path analysis revealed that mindfulness had a direct negative impact on and decreased the level of state anxiety (b = -0.22, p = 0.002), whereas psychological flexibility influenced the variable indirectly (b = 0.23, p = 0.002) by enhancing psychosomatic functioning (b = -0.64, p < 0.001). Psychological flexibility and mindfulness may mediate the development of mental disorders and facilitate achieving overall wellbeing. The study points to the usefulness of mindfulness practice as a form of self-help with anxiety symptoms; this is crucial during the pandemic because contact with clients is restricted.","Wielgus, Benita; Urban, Witold; Patriak, Aleksandra; Cichocki, Lukasz",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),255,1

This underscores an urgent need for developing a drug against SARS-CoV-2. The main protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is considered an essential protein for maintaining the viral life cycle and, therefore, a potential target for drug development. In a recent study, 1000 potential ligands were identified for 3CLpro by screening 1.3 billion compounds from the ZINC15 library. In the current study, we have further screened these 1000 compounds using structure-based virtual screening utilizing the Schrödinger suite and identified nine compounds having a docking score of â¼ -11.0 kcal/mol or less. The top 5 hits display good pharmacological profiles revealing better absorption, proper permeability across the membrane, uniform distribution, and non-toxic. The molecular docking study is further complemented by molecular dynamics simulations of the top 5 docked complexes. The binding free energy analyses via the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) scheme reveals that ZINC000452260308 is the most potent (&#916;Gbind = -14.31 kcal/mol) inhibitor.

Moreover, drainage in the head and neck area needs cosmetic care, especially in the pediatric population. In this report, we introduce our method of percutaneous abscess drainage using an indwelling needle cannula. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten pediatric and five adult patients with cervical and/or facial abscess treated with this drainage method were retrospectively reviewed. Using an indwelling needle cannula (18-14 G Surflow®, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), abscesses were penetrated under ultrasonic examination. Once purulent retention was identified, the inner metal needle was removed and the outer elastic needle was left and fixed. The outer needle was connected to the tube for continuous suction drainage for large abscess. RESULTS: The primary diseases of these abscesses were cervical abscess of dental origin (5), purulent lymphadenitis (3), pyriform sinus fistula (2) and subperiosteal abscess due to mastoiditis (2), circumorbital cellulitis (1), infection of Warthin's tumor (1), and unknown origin (1). The median (range) duration of drainage was 4 days (3-9 days). Abscesses were successfully treated, and no patients required additional incision for abscess drainage. No apparent scars after drainage were observed. CONCLUSION: This technique resembles the usual venous placement of an indwelling needle cannula and is thought to be familiar to physicians. Although simple and inexpensive, this drainage is safe, effective, and minimally invasive for the treatment of abscess.","Tanaka, Kumiko; Tsunoda, Atsunobu; Tou, Miri; Sonoda, Kenji; Arai, Shinpei; Anzai, Takashi; Matsumoto, Fumihiko",Am J Otolaryngol,255,16

This study aimed to determine the incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 in a large cohort of IBD patients on biologic therapy. METHODS: This observational retrospective multicenter study collected data about COVID-19 in IBD patients on biologic therapy in Italy, between February and May 2020. The main end-points were (i) to assess both the cumulative incidence and clinical outcome of COVID-19, according to different biologic agents and (ii) to compare them with the general population and a cohort IBD patients undergoing non-biologic therapies. RESULTS: Among 1816 IBD patients, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was 3.9 per 1000 (7/1816) with a 57% hospitalization rate and a 29% case-fatality rate. The class of biologic agents was the only risk factor of developing COVID-19 (P = 0.01).

The anti-tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) demonstrates non-specific protective innate immune-boosting effects. Here, we determined if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion in a retrospective observational study of a diverse cohort of health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: We assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and collected medical questionnaires, including BCG vaccination status and pre-existing demographic and clinical characteristics, from an observational cohort of HCWs in a multi-site Los Angeles healthcare organization. We used multi-variate analysis to estimate if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion. RESULTS: Of the 6,201 HCWs, 29.6% reported a history of BCG vaccination whereas 68.9% did not receive BCG vaccination. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG as well as incidence of self-reported clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 were significantly decreased among HCWs with a history of BCG vaccination compared to those without BCG vaccination. After adjusting for age and sex, we found that history of BCG vaccination, but not meningococcal, pneumococcal or influenza vaccination, was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion. CONCLUSIONS: History of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and reduced reported COVID-19-related clinical symptoms in this cohort of HCWs. Therefore, large randomized prospective clinical trials of BCG vaccination are urgently needed to confirm if BCG vaccination can induced a protective effect against SARS-CoV2 infection.

Information on cardiac injury is scarce. We aimed to evaluate cardiovascular damage in patients with COVID-19 and determine the correlation of high-sensitivity cardiac-specific troponin T (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) with the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: We included 872 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 from February to April 2020. We tested 651 patients for high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) and 506 for NT-proBNP on admission. Cardiac injury was defined as hs-TnT> 14ng/L, the upper 99th percentile. Levels of NT-proBNP> 300 pg/mL were considered related to some extent of cardiac injury. The primary composite endpoint was 30-day mortality or mechanical ventilation (MV). RESULTS: Cardiac injury by hs-TnT was observed in 34.6% of our COVID-19 patients. Mortality or MV were higher in cardiac injury than noncardiac injury patients (39.1% vs 9.1%). Hs-TnT and NT-proBNP levels were independent predictors of death or MV (HR, 2.18; 95%CI, 1.23-3.83 and 1.87 (95%CI, 1.05-3.36), respectively) and of mortality alone (HR, 2.91; 95%CI, 1.211-7.04 and 5.47; 95%CI, 2.10-14.26, respectively). NT-ProBNP significantly improved the troponin model discrimination of mortality or MV (C-index 0.83 to 0.84), and of mortality alone (C-index 0.85 to 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial injury measured at admission was a common finding in patients with COVID-19. It reliably predicted the occurrence of mortality and need of MV, the most severe complications of the disease. NT-proBNP improved the prognostic accuracy of hs-TnT.","Calvo-Fernández, Alicia; Izquierdo, Andrea; Subirana, Isaac; Farré, Nuria; Vila, Joan; Durán, Xavier; García-Guimaraes, Marcos; Valdivielso, Sandra; Cabero, Paula; Soler, Cristina; García-Ribas, Cora; Rodríguez, Clara; Llagostera, Marc; Mojón, Diana; Vicente, Miren; Solé-González, Eduard; Sánchez-Carpintero, Andrea; Tevar, Cristina; Marrugat, Jaume; Vaquerizo, Beatriz",Rev. esp. de cardiol.

This review evaluates the preclinical and clinical evidence on use of cloth and surgical face masks in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and proposes a trial to gather further evidence. METHODS: PubMed, EMbase, and the Cochrane Library were searched. Studies of SARS-CoV-2 and face masks and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of n &#8805; 50 for other respiratory illnesses were included. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in this study. One preclinical and 1 observational cohort clinical study found significant benefit of masks in limiting SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Eleven RCTs in a meta-analysis studying other respiratory illnesses found no significant benefit of masks (±hand hygiene) for influenza-like-illness symptoms nor laboratory confirmed viruses. One RCT found a significant benefit of surgical masks compared with cloth masks. CONCLUSION: There is limited available preclinical and clinical evidence for face mask benefit in SARS-CoV-2. RCT evidence for other respiratory viral illnesses shows no significant benefit of masks in limiting transmission but is of poor quality and not SARS-CoV-2 specific. There is an urgent need for evidence from randomized controlled trials to investigate the efficacy of surgical and cloth masks on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and user reported outcomes such as comfort and compliance.","Nanda, Akriti; Hung, Ivan; Kwong, Ava; Man, Vivian Chi-Mei; Roy, Pankaj; Davies, Lucy; Douek, Michael",Journal of evidence-based medicine (Online),255,16

Objective To conduct a meta-analysis of the frequency of LQT in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection treated with HCQ. Data Sources PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and preprint servers (medRxiv, Research Square) were searched for studies published between December 2019 and June 30, 2020. Methods Effect statistics were pooled using random effects. The quality of observational studies and randomized controlled trials was appraised with STROBE and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tools, respectively. Outcomes Critical LQT was defined as: (1) maximum QT corrected (QTc)&#8805;500 ms (if QRS<120 ms) or QTc&#8805;550 ms (if QRS&#8805;120 ms), and (2) QTc increase &#8805;60 ms. Results In the 28 studies included (n=9124), the frequency of LQT during HCQ treatment was 6.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.7-10.2). In 20 studies (n=7825), patients were also taking other QT-prolonging drugs. The frequency of LQT in the other 8 studies (n=1299) was 1.7% (95% CI: 0.3-3.9). Twenty studies (n=6869) reported HCQ discontinuation due to LQT, with a frequency of 3.7% (95% CI: 1.5-6.6). The frequency of ventricular arrhythmias during HCQ treatment was 1.68% (127/7539) and that of arrhythmogenic death was 0.69% (39/5648). Torsades de Pointes occurred in 0.06% (3/5066). Patients aged >60 years were at highest risk of HCQ-associated LQT (P<0.001). Conclusions HCQ-associated cardiotoxicity in SARS-CoV-2 patients is uncommon but requires ECG monitoring, particularly in those aged >60 years and/or taking other QT-prolonging drugs.","Oscanoa, Teodoro J; Vidal, Xavier; Kanters, Jørgen K; Romero-Ortuno, Roman",Int J Antimicrob Agents,255,24
414628,414628,414628,Uremia-Associated Immunological Aging and Severity of COVID-19 Infection,16.326502,7.203231,2021,"BACKGROUND: Lockdown was imposed for children for 75 days in Turkey to limit the spread of COVID-19. During this period, children have to stay indoors, which might probably increase their exposures to indoor allergens and pollutants. Besides, reduced exposures to respiratory tract infections and outdoor pollutants might be favorable outcomes of this lockdown period. We evaluated the effects of the lockdown on house dust mite (HDM)-sensitized children with respiratory allergies. METHODS: Three-month clinical and medication data of 165 mild-moderate asthmatic children with or without allergic rhinitis (AR), who were grouped according to their HDM sensitization status, were retrieved from patient records. Demographics, asthma control tests, nasal visual analog scores, and outdoor air quality monitoring data were used for assessments in comparisons with the same period in the previous year. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients had asthma, and 81 patients had asthma with AR. Sensitization to HDM was present in 61.8% of the children. Patients experienced reduced numbers of upper respiratory tract infections (P = .008) and reduced asthma exacerbations (P < .001) compared with the same period in the previous year. Asthma control tests were significantly improved (P < .001), and cumulative inhaled corticosteroid usages were significantly reduced (P < .001). Noteworthily, nasal symptoms were significantly worsened in HDM-sensitized asthmatics with AR (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted that reduction in respiratory tract infections and outdoor pollution may play roles in asthma control and prevent exacerbations despite continuous indoor allergen exposure. Besides, worsening of nasal symptoms in HDM-sensitized asthmatics with AR implies the importance of indoor avoidance measures for AR control.","Yucel, Esra; Suleyman, Ayse; Hizli Demirkale, Zeynep; Guler, Nermin; Tamay, Zeynep Ulker; Ozdemir, Cevdet",Pediatr. allergy immunol,255,26

The epidemiology of emotional disorders is greatly influenced by stressful events. This study sought to assess the prevalence rate and socio-demographic correlates of depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents affected by the outbreak of COVID-19. We conducted a cross-sectional study among Chinese students aged 12-18 years during the COVID-19 epidemic period. An online survey was used to conduct rapid assessment. A total of 8079 participants were involved in the study. An online survey was used to collect demographic data, assess students' awareness of COVID-19, and assess depressive and anxiety symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, respectively. The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and a combination of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 43.7%, 37.4%, and 31.3%, respectively, among Chinese high school students during the COVID-19 outbreak. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender was the higher risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms. In terms of grades, senior high school was a risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms; the higher the grade, the greater the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Our findings show there is a high prevalence of psychological health problems among adolescents, which are negatively associated with the level of awareness of COVID-19. These findings suggest that the government needs to pay more attention to psychological health among adolescents while combating COVID-19.","Zhou, Shuang-Jiang; Zhang, Li-Gang; Wang, Lei-Lei; Guo, Zhao-Chang; Wang, Jing-Qi; Chen, Jin-Cheng; Liu, Mei; Chen, Xi; Chen, Jing-Xu",Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry,255,16

The stronger the suppression measure, the faster it achieves the low numbers of infections that are conducive to subsequent management.

Statistical analysis was performed to determine differences in well-being and compliance to social distancing measures between respondents with and without self-reported IBS. Factors associated with improvement or worsening of IBS symptoms were evaluated. RESULTS: Out of 2704 respondents, 2024 (74.9%) did not have IBS, 305 (11.3%) had self-reported IBS, and 374 (13.8%) did not know what IBS was. Self-reported IBS respondents reported significantly worse emotional, social, and psychological well-being compared with non-IBS respondents and were less compliant to social distancing measures (28.2% vs 35.3%, P = 0.029); 61.6% reported no change, 26.6% reported improvement, and 11.8% reported worsening IBS symptoms.

A fundamental goal of algorithmic fairness is to avoid the pitfalls in human judgement by learning policies that improve the overall outcomes while providing fair treatment to protected classes. In this paper, we propose a causal framework that learns optimal intervention policies from data subject to fairness constraints. We define two measures of treatment bias and infer best treatment assignment that minimizes the bias while optimizing overall outcome. We demonstrate that there is a dilemma of balancing fairness and overall benefit; however, allowing preferential treatment to protected classes in certain circumstances (affirmative action) can dramatically improve the overall benefit while also preserving fairness. We apply our framework to data containing student outcomes on standardized tests and show how it can be used to design real-world policies that fairly improve student test scores. Our framework provides a principled way to learn fair treatment policies in real-world settings.","He, Yuzi; Burghardt, Keith; Guo, Siyi; Lerman, Kristina",,255,24

METHODS: Patients totaling 239 were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were included in this study. Patients were divided into the improvement group and the death group according to their outcome (improvement or death). Clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters were collected from medical records. Continuous variables were tested by an independent sample T test, and categorical variables were analyzed by the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in death patients. The time-dependent area under curves (AUC) based on white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count by age, blood urea nitrogen, and C-reactive protein were plotted. RESULTS: Efficacy evaluation indicated that 99 (41.4%) patients had deteriorated, and 140 (58.6%) patients had improved. Oxygen saturation, hemoglobin levels, infection-related indicators, lymphocyte and platelet counts, C-reactive protein, serum albumin, liver and kidney function, and lactate dehydrogenase in improvement group were statistically significant between the improvement and death groups. A survival analysis revealed that comorbidities, lymphocyte counts, platelet count, serum albumin, C-reactive protein level, and renal dysfunction may be risk factors in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Patients with comorbidities, lower lymphocyte counts in hemogram, platelet count and serum albumin, high C-reactive protein level, and renal dysfunction may have higher risk for death.

Adolescents consume substantially more free sugar than is recommended. National (UK) School Food Standards (SFS) are in place but are not mandatory in all schools, and their impact on the diets of secondary school pupils is unknown. We aim to evaluate how SFS and wider healthy eating recommendations (from the national School Food Plan (SFP)) are implemented in secondary schools and how they influence pupils' diets and dental health. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Secondary-level academies/free schools in the West Midlands, UK were divided into two groups: SFS mandated and SFS non-mandated. Using propensity scores to guide sampling, we aim to recruit 22 schools in each group. We will compare data on school food provision and sales, school food culture and environment, and the food curriculum from each group, collected through: school staff, governor, pupil, parent surveys; school documents; and observation. We will explore the implementation level for the SFS requirements and SFP recommendations and develop a school food typology. We aim to recruit 1980 pupils aged 11-15 years across the 44 schools and collect dietary intake (24-hour recall) and dental health data through self-completion surveys. We will compare free sugar/other dietary intake and dental health across the two SFS groups and across the identified school types. School type will be further characterised in 4-8 case study schools through school staff interviews and pupil focus groups. Evaluation of economic impact will be through a cost-consequence analysis and an exploratory cost-utility analysis.

The expression of tachykinins increases in the hypothalamus before puberty and, therefore, they are considered as initiators of pubertal development by stimulating the awakening of Kiss1 neurons. This is supported by studies showing delayed or absent puberty onset in humans and mice devoid of tachykinin signaling, and the advancement of puberty onset in rodents subjected to chronic activation of tachykinin receptors. This review compiles the current knowledge on the role of tachykinins in the control of puberty onset.","Navarro, Víctor M",Curr Opin Endocr Metab Res,255,1

There is concern that people living with HIV (PLWH), especially those with severe immunosuppression, and COVID-19 may have severe disease and a negative clinical outcome. Most studies on COVID-19 in PLWH are from Asia, Europe and America where population dynamics, antiretroviral treatment coverage and coexisting opportunistic infections may differ from that in sub-Saharan Africa. We report on the clinical profile and outcome of three cases of PLWH co-infected with SARS-CoV-2. They all presented with fever, cough and breathlessness and also had advanced HIV infection as evidenced by opportunistic infections, high HIV viral loads and low CD4 counts. The patients responded favourably to the standard of care and were discharged home. Our findings suggest that PLWH with advanced immunosuppression may not necessarily have an unfavourable disease course and outcome. However, case-controlled studies with a larger population size are needed to better understand the impact of COVID-19 in this patient population.

Three factors were revealed including (1) intervention and support from the government to combat and manage the pandemic, (2) intervention and support from businesses to prevent stockpiling or panic buying, and (3) influence of different categories of social groups, namely, family and relatives, peers and friends, acquaintance and non-acquainted social-media group. The second study collected data from five countries (Australia, India, China, Vietnam and Indonesia) to understand the relationship between these factors and panic buying engagement or disengagement.

Many systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been performed to synthesize evidence for better understanding this new disease. However, some concerns have been raised about rapid COVID-19 research. This meta-epidemiological study aims to methodologically assess the current systematic reviews and meta-analyses on COVID-19. METHODS: We searched in various databases for systematic reviews with meta-analyses published between 1 January 2020 and 31 October 2020. We extracted their basic characteristics, data analyses, evidence appraisal, and assessment of publication bias and heterogeneity. RESULTS: We identified 295 systematic reviews on COVID-19. The median time from submission to acceptance was 33 days. Among these systematic reviews, 73.9% evaluated clinical manifestations or comorbidities of COVID-19. Stata was the most used software programme (43.39%). The odds ratio was the most used effect measure (34.24%). Moreover, 28.14% of the systematic reviews did not present evidence appraisal. Among those reporting the risk of bias results, 14.64% of studies had a high risk of bias. Egger's test was the most used method for assessing publication bias (38.31%), while 38.66% of the systematic reviews did not assess publication bias. The I2 statistic was widely used for assessing heterogeneity (92.20%); many meta-analyses had high values of I2 . Among the meta-analyses using the random-effects model, 75.82% did not report the methods for model implementation; among those meta-analyses reporting implementation methods, the DerSimonian-Laird method was the most used one. CONCLUSIONS: The current systematic reviews and meta-analyses on COVID-19 might suffer from low transparency, high heterogeneity, and suboptimal statistical methods. It is recommended that future systematic reviews on COVID-19 strictly follow well-developed guidelines. Sensitivity analyses may be performed to examine how the synthesized evidence might depend on different methods for appraising evidence, assessing publication bias, and implementing meta-analysis models.","Rosenberger, Kristine J; Xu, Chang; Lin, Lifeng",J. eval. clin. pract.

With the similar context, in this article, we have studied sequence variability of the virus primarily focusing on three aspects: (a) sequence variability among SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in human host, which are in the same coronavirus family, (b) sequence variability of SARS-CoV-2 in human host for 54 different countries and (c) sequence variability between coronavirus family and country specific SARS-CoV-2 sequences in human host. For this purpose, as a case study, we have performed topological analysis of 2391 global genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in association with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV using an integrated semi-alignment based computational technique. The results of the semi-alignment based technique are experimentally and statistically found similar to alignment based technique and computationally faster. Moreover, the outcome of this analysis can help to identify the nations with homogeneous SARS-CoV-2 sequences, so that same vaccine can be applied to their heterogeneous human population.","Sarkar, Jnanendra Prasad; Saha, Indrajit; Seal, Arijit; Maity, Debasree; Maulik, Ujjwal",Infect Genet Evol,255,33

In the absence of vaccines and effective therapeutical solutions, non-pharmaceutic intervention has become a major way for controlling the epidemic. Gentle mitigation interventions are able to slow down the epidemic but not to halt it well. While strict suppression interventions are efficient for controlling the epidemic, long-term measures are likely to have negative impacts on economics and people's daily live. Hence, dynamically balancing suppression and mitigation interventions plays a fundamental role in manipulating the epidemic curve. METHODS: We collected data of the number of infections for several countries during the COVID-19 pandemics and found a clear phenomenon of periodic waves of infection. Based on the observation, by connecting the infection level with the medical resources and a tolerance parameter, we propose a mathematical model to understand impacts of combining intervention measures on the epidemic dynamics. RESULTS: Depending on the parameters of the medical resources, tolerance level, and the starting time of interventions, the combined intervention measure dynamically changes with the infection level, resulting in a periodic wave of infections controlled below an accepted level. The study reveals that, (a) with an immediate, strict suppression, the numbers of infections and deaths are well controlled with a significant reduction in a very short time period; (b) an appropriate, dynamical combination of suppression and mitigation may find a feasible way in reducing the impacts of epidemic on people's live and economics. CONCLUSIONS: While the assumption of interventions deployed with a cycle of period in the model is limited and unrealistic, the phenomenon of periodic waves of infections in reality is captured by our model. These results provide helpful insights for policy-makers to dynamically deploy an appropriate intervention strategy to effectively battle against the COVID-19.","Han, Yuexing; Xie, Zeyang; Guo, Yike; Wang, Bing",BMC Public Health,255,23

First, participants were recruited to a low-dose cohort, and within each age group, participants were randomly assigned to receive either intramuscular ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (2·2â×â1010 virus particles) or a control vaccine, MenACWY, using block randomisation and stratified by age and dose group and study site, using the following ratios: in the 18-55 years group, 1:1 to either two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY; in the 56-69 years group, 3:1:3:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY; and in the 70 years and older, 5:1:5:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY. Prime-booster regimens were given 28 days apart. Participants were then recruited to the standard-dose cohort (3·5-6·5â×â1010 virus particles of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and the same randomisation procedures were followed, except the 18-55 years group was assigned in a 5:1 ratio to two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY. Participants and investigators, but not staff administering the vaccine, were masked to vaccine allocation. The specific objectives of this report were to assess the safety and humoral and cellular immunogenicity of a single-dose and two-dose schedule in adults older than 55 years. Humoral responses at baseline and after each vaccination until 1 year after the booster were assessed using an in-house standardised ELISA, a multiplex immunoassay, and a live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) microneutralisation assay (MNA80). Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo IFN-Î³ enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The coprimary outcomes of the trial were efficacy, as measured by the number of cases of symptomatic, virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04400838, and ISRCTN, 15281137. FINDINGS: Between May 30 and Aug 8, 2020, 560 participants were enrolled: 160 aged 18-55 years (100 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 60 assigned to MenACWY), 160 aged 56-69 years (120 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY), and 240 aged 70 years and older (200 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY). Seven participants did not receive the boost dose of their assigned two-dose regimen, one participant received the incorrect vaccine, and three were excluded from immunogenicity analyses due to incorrectly labelled samples. 280 (50%) of 552 analysable participants were female. Local and systemic reactions were more common in participants given ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 than in those given the control vaccine, and similar in nature to those previously reported (injection-site pain, feeling feverish, muscle ache, headache), but were less common in older adults (aged &#8805;56 years) than younger adults. In those receiving two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, after the prime vaccination local reactions were reported in 43 (88%) of 49 participants in the 18-55 years group, 22 (73%) of 30 in the 56-69 years group, and 30 (61%) of 49 in the 70 years and older group, and systemic reactions in 42 (86%) participants in the 18-55 years group, 23 (77%) in the 56-69 years group, and 32 (65%) in the 70 years and older group. As of Oct 26, 2020, 13 serious adverse events occurred during the study period, none of which were considered to be related to either study vaccine. In participants who received two doses of vaccine, median anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses 28 days after the boost dose were similar across the three age cohorts (standard-dose groups: 18-55 years, 20â713 arbitrary units [AU]/mL [IQR 13â898-33â550], n=39; 56-69 years, 16â170 AU/mL [10â233-40â353], n=26; and &#8805;70 years 17â561 AU/mL [9705-37â796], n=47; p=0·68). Neutralising antibody titres after a boost dose were similar across all age groups (median MNA80 at day 42 in the standard-dose groups: 18-55 years, 193 [IQR 113-238], n=39; 56-69 years, 144 [119-347], n=20; and &#8805;70 years, 161 [73-323], n=47; p=0·40). By 14 days after the boost dose, 208 (>99%) of 209 boosted participants had neutralising antibody responses. T-cell responses peaked at day 14 after a single standard dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (18-55 years: median 1187 spot-forming cells [SFCs] per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells [IQR 841-2428], n=24; 56-69 years: 797 SFCs [383-1817], n=29; and &#8805;70 years: 977 SFCs [458-1914], n=48). INTERPRETATION: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 appears to be better tolerated in older adults than in younger adults and has similar immunogenicity across all age groups after a boost dose. Further assessment of the efficacy of this vaccine is warranted in all age groups and individuals with comorbidities.

METHODS: Observational study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Amman, Jordan. Demographic data, clinical presentation and smoking status were collected. Sinonasal symptoms, using Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) Questionnaire, were evaluated. Smell/taste dysfunction was followed for three months. RESULTS: Ninety-Seven patients had satisfactory responses. Eighty-six patients were symptomatic (41 at presentation, and 45 during admission). Among those patients, 59.3% had cough, 52.3% sore throat and 48.8% fever. The most common initial symptom was sore throat. Shortness of breath and smell/taste dysfunction were significantly higher in females. Surprisingly, shortness of breath was more common in non-smokers. Smell/taste dysfunction affected 25.6% of patients, but was the first symptom in only one patient. Fourteen of 22 symptoms in SNOT-22 had significant increase. The overall average of symptoms scores increased from 0.472 to 1.034, with smell/taste dysfunction to have the most increment. The latter symptom recovered completely in 81% and dysgeusia developed in 9.5% at three months, and it recovered completely in all patients at six months. CONCLUSION: Although COVID-19 may produce severe lower airways disease, it has modest effect on nose and paranasal sinuses. Moreover, smell/taste dysfunction is a prominent symptom, but it usually recovers dramatically.","Tarifi, Amjed; Al Shdaifat, Amjad A; Al-Shudifat, Abdel-Ellah M; Azab, Mohammed; Ismail, Ja039; far,; Bashir, Rand; Amro, Aous; Altarifi, Ahmad; Khader, Yousef",Int J Clin Pract,255,16

Although these changes are necessary, they will differentially affect patients in a way that highlights and exacerbates existing inequities in health care access and outcomes. Socially vulnerable groups are already disproportionately affected by COVID-19 infection and more likely to experience severe morbidity and mortality. Some reasons for this include a limited ability to practice risk-reducing behaviors such as physical distancing, higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions, and less access to medical care. Additionally, the structural changes now taking place in health care delivery have negatively affected the ability of socially vulnerable groups to obtain necessary obstetric and gynecologic care, which may lead to poorer outcomes. As physician-leaders enact new policies to respond to the COVID-19 public health crisis, it is important to consider the potential for exacerbating existing health inequities and to be proactive in creating policies that promote equity.","Onwuzurike, Chiamaka; Meadows, Audra R; Nour, Nawal M",Obstet Gynecol,255,1

The analysis herein reported is carried out for three concentration regimes: (i) low (≲108 virions/ml), (ii) intermediate (∼109-1010 virions/ml), and (iii) high (≳1011 virions/ml). Given the high binding effectiveness of f-AuNPs to virions, three different configurations are expected to arise: (i) virions completely surrounded by f-AuNPs, (ii) aggregates (dimers or trimers) of virions linked by f-AuNPs, and (iii) single f-AuNP surrounded by virions. It is demonstrated that 20 nm diameter gold nanoparticles functionalized against all three kinds of SARS-CoV-2 proteins (membrane, envelope, and spike) allow one to reach a limit of detection (LOD) of ∼106 virions/ml, whereas the use of only one kind of f-AuNP entails a ten-fold worsening of the LOD. It is also shown that the close proximity (∼5 nm) of the f-AuNP to the virions assumed throughout this analysis is essential to avoid the hook effect, thereby pointing out the importance of realizing an apt functionalization procedure that keeps thin the dielectric layer (e.g., proteins or aptamers) surrounding the gold nanoparticles. © 2021 Author(s).","Minopoli, A.; Scardapane, E.; Acunzo, A.; Campanile, R.; Della Ventura, B.; Velotta, R.",AIP Advances,255,16

Applying the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) to the unconstrained control problems (i.e. without costs of control or resource limitations), we prove that, for all the policies investigated, only bang-bang controls with at most one switch are admitted. When a switch occurs, the optimal strategy is to delay the control action some amount of time and then apply the control at the maximum rate for the remainder of the outbreak. This result is in contrast with previous findings on the unconstrained problems of minimizing the total infectious burden over an outbreak, where the optimal strategy is to use the maximal control for the entire epidemic. Then, the critical consequence of our results is that, in a wide range of epidemiological circumstances, it may be impossible to minimize the total infectious burden while minimizing the epidemic duration, and vice versa. Moreover, numerical simulations highlighted additional unexpected results, showing that the optimal control can be delayed also when the control reproduction number is lower than one and that the switching time from no control to maximum control can even occur after the peak of infection has been reached. Our results are especially important for livestock diseases where the minimization of outbreaks duration is a priority due to sanitary restrictions imposed to farms during ongoing epidemics, such as animal movements and export bans.","Bolzoni, Luca; Bonacini, Elena; Soresina, Cinzia; Groppi, Maria",,255,23

We collected high-resolution satellite images for 5 million 1km $\times$ 1km grid cells covering 21 African countries. We contribute to the growing body of literature in this area by training our machine learning algorithm on ground-truth data. We show that our approach strongly improves the predictive accuracy.

This study aims to summarize the international experience of performance-based risk-sharing arrangements (PBRSAs) and identify the preconditions for a successful implementation of such schemes. Their implications for the Chinese healthcare market are discussed. METHODS: A systematic literature review (in PubMed) was conducted to review the evidence on the nature and performance of PBRSAs in the past 10 years. Grey literature was searched for reports in government websites of the countries in scope. RESULTS: The search identifies 463 records from PubMed and 3 additional records from other sources. Thirty-one publications are included in the final review. The following preconditions were identified to support a successful implementation of PBRSAs: (1) Identify meaningful and feasible outcome measurements; (2) Establish an effective and efficient data collection infrastructure; (3) Control of the implementation costs; (4) Develop governance and administrative infrastructure to allow delisting and rebate/refund; (5) Clarify personal data protection issues. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of PBRSAs has proven to be challenging. Although the Chinese healthcare system is not yet well equipped to implement such schemes, some recent changes may pave the way to successful PBRSAs for particular innovative products.","Xu, Weiwei; Wu, Jing",Int J Technol Assess Health Care,255,1

This study examines the factors that led to the receipt of user fee exemption cards, and the effect of card possession on the utilisation of healthcare services. Methods: A panel data set of 1652 randomly selected ultra-poor individuals was used. Logistic regression was applied on the end line data to identify factors associated with the receipt of user fee exemption cards. Random-effects modelling was applied to the panel data to determine the effect of the card possession on healthcare service utilisation among those who reported an illness six months before the surveys. Results: Out of the ultra-poor surveyed in 2017, 75.51% received exemption cards. Basic literacy (p = 0.03), living within 5 km from a healthcare centre (p = 0.02) and being resident in Diébougou or Gourcy (p = 0.00) were positively associated with card possession. Card possession did not increase health service utilisation (ß = -0.07; 95% CI = -0.45; 0.32; p = 0.73). Conclusion: A better intervention design and implementation is required.

This study explores if it has also affected trust in political institutions. As early research suggests that trust is associated with governments' responses to the pandemic, citizens' health behaviours, public compliance with regulations, and overall levels of COVID-19 mortality, it is important to understand what drives citizens' trust during the crisis. Using high-quality data from the German GESIS Covid-19 Special Survey, we analyse predictors of institutional trust at the onset of the pandemic in March 2020. We pay specific attention to the effect of sociotropic and egotropic impact of the crisis. We find that on the societal level, the intensity of the health threat, but not policy responses, are linked to trust, while on the individual level, employment in a ""critical occupation"" and individual family situations matter. We argue that in the ongoing management of the crisis, consequences for specific groups of citizens, such as families, need to be considered.

One of the applications is the Decision Support System (DSS) that helps the medical experts particularly doctors in diagnosing TB grade 1+. 2+, and 3+ rapidly. Another problem is related to the imbalance between the number of patients and the number of medical practitioners in the condition of pandemic Corona Virus Disease (Covid-19) today. Hence, DSS is highly required and it can be used for the long-term management of Covid. In this study, the rapid classification of normal lung, tuberculosis lung, and Covid-19 lung based on the Chest X-Ray (CXR) image was proposed as the initial step of DSS implementation. The proposed image processing based CXR classification using Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) obtained the highest accuracy rate of 88.37%. This accuracy was obtained in the second scenario with the 208 CXR datasets. The small number of datasets used was related to the limited number of CXR Covid-19 images with good quality brightness.

They combine the potential of mRNA to encode for almost any protein with an excellent safety profile and a flexible production process. During the last decade, the mRNA vaccine approach has been increasingly recognized and viewed as a versatile tool for the development of new innovative therapeutics not only in infectious disease settings but also in cancer. mRNA vaccines traditionally consist of a messenger RNA synthesized by in vitro transcription using a bacteriophage RNA polymerase and a template DNA that encodes the antigen(s) of interest. Once administered and internalized by host cells, the mRNA transcripts are translated directly in the cytoplasm of the cell. The resulting antigens are presented to the immune system cells to stimulate an immune response. Dendritic cells (DCs) can be utilized as a carrier by delivering tumor-associated antigen mRNAs or total tumor RNA to their cytoplasm;then, the mRNA-loaded DCs can be delivered to the host to elicit a specific immune response. Recently, 2 mRNA vaccines were approved for the first time for human use--to prevent COVID-19 infection--bringing excitement for the future possibilities of this approach for cancer immunotherapy as well as for preventing other infectious diseases.","Copur, Mehmet Sitki",Oncology (08909091),255,16

Use of face masks is therefore recommended for both personal and social protection. We found social distancing effective at reducing transmission potential across all droplet sizes. However, the presence of a human body 1 m away modifies the aerodynamics so that downstream droplet dispersion is enhanced, which has implications on safe distancing in queues. Based on median viral load, we found that an average of 0.55 viral copies is inhaled at 1 m distance per cough. Droplet evaporation results in significant reduction in droplet counts, but airborne transmission remains possible even under low humidity conditions.","Li, Hongying; Leong, Fong Yew; Xu, George; Kang, Chang Wei; Lim, Keng Hui; Tan, Ban Hock; Loo, Chian Min",,255,16

Candida species are major constituents of the human mycobiome and the main cause of invasive fungal infections, with a high mortality rate. Invasive yeast infections (IYIs) are increasingly recognized as s complication of severe COVID-19. Despite the marked immune dysregulation in COVID-19, no prominent defects have been reported in immune cells that are critically required for immunity to Candida. This suggests that relevant clinical factors, including prolonged ICU stays, central venous catheters, and broad-spectrum antibiotic use, may be key factors causing COVID-19 patients to develop IYIs. Although data on the comparative performance of diagnostic tools are often lacking in COVID-19 patients, a combination of serological and molecular techniques may present a promising option for the identification of IYIs. Clinical awareness and screening are needed, as IYIs are difficult to diagnose, particularly in the setting of severe COVID-19. Echinocandins and azoles are the primary antifungal used to treat IYIs, yet the therapeutic failures exerted by multidrug-resistant Candida spp. such as C. auris and C. glabrata call for the development of new antifungal drugs with novel mechanisms of action.","Arastehfar, Amir; Carvalho, Agostinho; Nguyen, M Hong; Hedayati, Mohammad Taghi; Netea, Mihai G; Perlin, David S; Hoenigl, Martin",,255,22

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed systemic (political and health care systems), demographic (aging, race) and,based on the results of our approach, spatial (spatial isolation and connectivity) yvulnerabilities as well. In this paper, we develop a risk prediction model based on two composite indicators of social vulnerability. These indicators reflect the two main contrasting risks associated with COVID-19, demographic vulnerability and, as consequences of the lockdowns, economic vulnerability.

The data is in the form of absolute numbers and proportions. Using the percentages, retrospective synthetic data of 100 survivors and 100 deaths were generated using random number libraries so that proportions of ages, genders, co-morbidities, and occupations were constant as in the original data. Logistic regression of the four predictor factors of age, sex, co-morbidities and occupation revealed that only age and comorbidities significantly affected mortality. Sex and occupation when adjusted for other factors in the equation were not significant predictors of mortality. Age and presence of co-morbidities correlated negatively with survival with co-efficient of -1.23 and -2.33 respectively. Odds ratio (OR) for dying from COVID-19 for every 10-year increase in age was 3.4 compared to the previous band of 10 years.

Since 2019, COVID-19, an emerging infection has swept the world and caused severe losses. Biosafety laboratories are mandatory sites for detecting high-risk viruses, so related research is urgently needed to prevent further laboratory-acquired infections of operators. This study investigated the effects of obstacles on exposure infection of staff in a biosafety laboratory with related experimental equipment. The numerical simulation results are highly verified by the measured results. The results indicate that although the equipment layout does not affect the bioaerosol removal time, nearly 17% of the pollutant particles in the actual laboratory cannot be discharged effectively compared with the ideal situation. These particles lingered in the lower space under the influence of vortex, which would increase the respiratory risk of operators. In addition, after the experiment a large part of bioaerosol particles would be captured by equipment and floor, and the deposition rate per unit area is 0.45%/m 2and 0.8%/m 2, respectively. Although the results show that the equipment layout could reduce the pollution on the floor, the disinfection is still an important link, especially on the surfaces of equipment. Meanwhile, the result also indicates that the action should be light and slow when operating in BSL-3 laboratory, so as to avoid the secondary suspension pollution of bioaerosol particles on the equipment surface and floor.","Liu, Zhijian; Zhuang, Wenbin; Hu, Xiaoqi; Zhao, Zhiheng; Rong, Rui; Ding, Wenjun; Li, Jinsong; Li, Na",Build.

We, therefore, interrogated redirected human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by single-cell RNA sequencing and characterized them experimentally in bulk and single-cell assays and a mouse xenograft model. TCR8 expression enhanced CD8+ T cell function and preserved less differentiated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after tumor challenge.

Methods: 131 health-care workers at the Department of Infectious Diseases in Västerås, Sweden, were included in the study. Abbott's SARS-COV-2 IgG immunoassay was used with a signal cut-off ratio of &#8805;1.4. Every third week from the beginning of May, blood samples were drawn, and the participants completed a questionnaire regarding symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and the result of any SARS-CoV-2 PCR performed since the last sampling occasion.

At the end, 25 (19%) of 131 participants were seropositive. One case of asymptomatic infection was detected, and two cases with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 did not develop IgG antibodies. Conclusion: The low rate of seroconversion during the study suggests that it is possible to prevent transmission of SARS-COV-2 in a high-exposure environment.

Following successful preclinical studies with mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP), we tested an mRNA-LNP formulation (CV7202). METHODS: In this phase 1, multi-center, controlled study in Belgium and Germany we enrolled 55 healthy 18-40-year-olds to receive intramuscular injections of 5 µg (n = 10), 1 µg (n = 16), or 2 µg (n = 16) CV7202 on Day 1; subsets (n = 8) of 1 µg and 2 µg groups received second doses on Day 29. Controls (n = 10) received rabies vaccine, Rabipur, on Days 1, 8 and 29. Safety and reactogenicity were assessed up to 28 days post-vaccination using diary cards; immunogenicity was measured as RABV-G-specific neutralizing titers (VNT) by RFFIT and IgG by ELISA. RESULTS: As initially tested doses of 5 µg CV7202 elicited unacceptably high reactogenicity we subsequently tested 1 and 2 µg doses which were better tolerated. No vaccine-related serious adverse events or withdrawals occurred. Low, dose-dependent VNT responses were detectable from Day 15 and by Day 29%, 31% and 22% of 1, 2 and 5 µg groups, respectively, had VNTs &#8805; 0·5 IU/mL, considered an adequate response by the WHO. After two 1 or 2 µg doses all recipients had titers &#8805; 0.5 IU/mL by Day 43. Day 57 GMTs were not significantly lower than those with Rabipur, which elicited adequate responses in all vaccinees after two doses. CV7202-elicited VNT were significantly correlated with RABV-G-specific IgG antibodies (r2 = 0.8319, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Two 1 µg or 2 µg doses of CV7202 were well tolerated and elicited rabies neutralizing antibody responses that met WHO criteria in all recipients, but 5 µg had unacceptable reactogenicity for a prophylactic vaccine.

Thanks to a combination of experiments on lipid vesicles supported by colloidal scaffolds and theoretical work, we demonstrate that the local geometry and global chemical composition of the bilayer determine both the spatial arrangement and the amount of mixing of the lipids. In the mixed phase, a strong geometrical anisotropy can give rise to an antimixed state, where the lipids are mixed, but their relative concentration varies across the membrane. After phase separation, the bilayer organizes in multiple lipid domains, whose location is pinned in specific regions, depending on the substrate curvature and the bending rigidity of the lipid domains. Our results provide critical insights into the phase separation of cellular membranes and, more generally, two-dimensional fluids on curved substrates.","Rinaldin, Melissa; Fonda, Piermarco; Giomi, Luca; Kraft, Daniela J",Nat Commun,255,24

One of these factors is the nsp13 helicase. Both the holo-RdRp and nsp13 are essential for viral replication and are targets for treating the disease COVID-19. Here we present cryoelectron microscopic structures of the SARS-CoV-2 holo-RdRp with an RNA template product in complex with two molecules of the nsp13 helicase. The Nidovirales order-specific N-terminal domains of each nsp13 interact with the N-terminal extension of each copy of nsp8. One nsp13 also contacts the nsp12 thumb. The structure places the nucleic acid-binding ATPase domains of the helicase directly in front of the replicating-transcribing holo-RdRp, constraining models for nsp13 function.

Mitigation efforts created an imbalance between population health, capacity of the healthcare system and economic prosperity. Each pandemic arising from a new virus is unknown territory for policy makers, and there is considerable uncertainty of the appropriateness of responses and outcomes. METHODS: A qualitative approach was used to review mixed sources of data including Australian reports, official government publications, and COVID-19 data to discern robust future responses. Publicly available epidemiological and economic data were utilised to provide insight into the impact of the pandemic on Australia's healthcare system and economy. RESULTS: Policies implemented by Australian government to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 impacted the healthcare sector and the economy. This paper incorporates lessons learned to inform optimal economic preparedness. The rationale for an economic response plan concomitant with the health pandemic plan is explored to guide Australian government policy makers in ensuring holistic and robust solutions for future pandemics. CONCLUSIONS: In future, an Australian Economic Pandemic Response Plan will aid in health and economic system preparedness, whilst a strong Australian economy and strategic planning will ensure resilience to future pandemics.","Higginson, Shannen; Milovanovic, Katarina; Gillespie, James; Matthews, Andrew; Williams, Christopher; Wall, Laura; Moy, Naomi; Hinwood, Madeline; Melia, Adrian; Paolucci, Francesco",,255,23

PURPOSE: Cost-avoidance studies of pharmacist interventions are common and often the first type of study conducted by investigators to quantify the economic impact of clinical pharmacy services. The purpose of this primer is to provide guidance for conducting cost-avoidance studies pertaining to clinical pharmacy practice. SUMMARY: Cost-avoidance studies represent a paradigm conceptually different from traditional pharmacoeconomic analysis. A cost-avoidance study reports on cost savings from a given intervention, where the savings is estimated based on a counterfactual scenario. Investigators need to determine what specifically would have happened to the patient if the intervention did not occur. This assessment can be fundamentally flawed, depending on underlying assumptions regarding the pharmacists' action and the patient trajectory. It requires careful identification of the potential consequence of nonaction, as well as probability and cost assessment. Given the uncertainty of assumptions, sensitivity analyses should be performed. A step-by-step methodology, formula for calculations, and best practice guidance is provided. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-avoidance studies focused on pharmacist interventions should be considered low-level evidence. These studies are acceptable to provide pilot data for the planning of future clinical trials. The guidance provided in this article should be followed to improve the quality and validity of such investigations.","Patanwala, Asad E; Narayan, Sujita W; Haas, Curtis E; Abraham, Ivo; Sanders, Arthur; Erstad, Brian L",Am. j. health system pharm,255,20

Recently, scientific research has widely demonstrated that the microbiota plays a fundamental role in modulating metabolic responses in the immune system. There is, in fact, a two-way interaction between lifestyle, infection, and immunity. The immune response is compromised if nutrition is unbalanced or insufficient, because diet affects the intestinal flora predisposing people to infections and, at the same time, the nutritional state can be aggravated by the immune response itself to the infection. We evaluate the link between balanced diet, the efficiency of the immune system, and microbiota with the aim of providing some practical advice for individuals, with special attention to the elderly. A correct lifestyle that follows the Mediterranean model, which is especially rich in plant-based foods along with the use of extra-virgin olive oil, are the basis of preventing LGI and other chronic pathologies, directly influencing the intestinal microbiota and consequently the immune response.","Suardi, Carlotta; Cazzaniga, Emanuela; Graci, Stephanie; Dongo, Dario; Palestini, Paola",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),255,21

The rapidly emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants could increase the transmissibility, aggravate the severity, and even fade the vaccine protection. Although the coinfections of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory pathogens have been reported, whether multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants coinfection exists remains controversial. This study collected 12,986 and 4,113 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the GISAID database on May 11, 2020 (GISAID20May11) and April 1, 2021 (GISAID21Apr1), respectively. With the single-nucleotide variants (SNV) and network clique analysis, we constructed the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) coexistence networks and noted the SNP number of the maximal clique as the coinfection index. The coinfection indices of GISAID20May11 and GISAID21Apr1 datasets were 16 and 34, respectively. Simulating the transmission routes and the mutation accumulations, we discovered the linear relationship between the coinfection index and the coinfected variant number. Based on the linear relationship, we deduced that the COVID-19 cases in the GISAID20May11 and GISAID21Apr1 datasets were coinfected with 2.20 and 3.42 SARS-CoV-2 variants on average. Additionally, we performed Nanopore sequencing on 42 COVID-19 patients to explore the virus mutational characteristics. We found the heterozygous SNPs in 41 COVID-19 cases, which support the coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 variants and challenge the accuracy of phylogenetic analysis. In conclusion, our findings reported the coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 variants in COVID-19 patients, demonstrated the increased coinfected variants number in the epidemic, and provided clues for the prolonged viral shedding and severe symptoms in some cases.","Li, Yinhu; Jiang, Yiqi; Li, Zhengtu; Yu, Yonghan; Chen, Jiaxing; Jia, Wenlong; Ng, Yen Kaow; Ye, Feng; Shen, Bairong; Li, Shuai Cheng",,255,16

Patients with schizophrenia are not participatory and have increased mortality and morbidity, patients with dementia cannot be cared for while depression, anxiety, bipolar tubing are associated with low immune status. Social stress is amplified by social isolation, amplifying depression and the mechanisms of decreased immunity. Hygiene measures and prophylactic behavior are impossible to put into practice in conditions of chronic mental illness. In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the risk for severe development is associated with the presence of comorbidities and immune system deficiency. Prothrombotic status, cytokine storm and alveolar destruction are mechanisms that aggravate the evolution of patients, especially in the context in which they have dysfunction of the autonomic system. The activity of proinflammatory cytokines is accentuated by hyperglutamatergia, which potentiates oxidative stress and triggers the mechanisms of neural apoptosis by stimulating microglial activation. Activation of M1-type microglia has an important role in pathogenesis of major psychiatric disorders, such as major depression, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and may associate hippocampal atrophy and disconnection of cognitive structures. Memantine and Amantadine, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor inhibitors, have demonstrated, through their pharmacological profile, psychotropic effects but also antiviral properties. In the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on these arguments, we suggest that they can be associated with the therapy with the basic psychotropics, Memantine or Amantadine, for the control of neuropsychiatric symptoms but also as adjuvants with antiviral action.","Marinescu, Ileana; Marinescu, Dragos; Mogoanta, Laurentiu; Efrem, Ion Cristian; Stovicek, Puiu Olivian",Rom J Morphol Embryol,255,29

These enzymes have a remarkable ability to cleave carotenoids at specific alkene bonds while leaving chemically similar sites within the polyene intact. Although several bacterial and eukaryotic CCDs have been characterized, the long-standing goal of experimentally visualizing a CCD-carotenoid complex at high resolution to explain this exquisite regioselectivity remains unfulfilled. CCD genes are also present in some archaeal genomes, but the encoded enzymes remain uninvestigated. Here, we address this knowledge gap through analysis of a metazoan-like archaeal CCD from Candidatus Nitrosotalea devanaterra (NdCCD). NdCCD was active toward ß-apocarotenoids but did not cleave bicyclic carotenoids. It exhibited an unusual regiospecificity, cleaving apocarotenoids solely at the C14'-C13' alkene bond to produce ß-apo-14'-carotenals. The structure of NdCCD revealed a tapered active site cavity markedly different from the broad active site observed for the retinal-forming Synechocystis apocarotenoid oxygenase (SynACO) but similar to the vertebrate retinoid isomerase RPE65. The structure of NdCCD in complex with its apocarotenoid product demonstrated that the site of cleavage is defined by interactions along the substrate binding cleft as well as selective stabilization of reaction intermediates at the scissile alkene. These data on the molecular basis of CCD catalysis shed light on the origins of the varied catalytic activities found in metazoan CCDs, opening the possibility of modifying their activity through rational chemical or genetic approaches.","Daruwalla, Anahita; Zhang, Jianye; Lee, Ho Jun; Khadka, Nimesh; Farquhar, Erik R; Shi, Wuxian; von Lintig, Johannes; Kiser, Philip D",Proc.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 628 patients with HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer who underwent up-front TORS from 2007 to 2017. Patients were stratified into two cohorts based on early-stage (cT1/2) versus locally-advanced (cT3/4) tumor at presentation. RESULTS: We identified 589 patients who presented with early-stage tumors, and 39 patients with locally-advanced tumors. Of these, 73% of patients required adjuvant radiation, and 33% required adjuvant chemoradiation. There was no significant difference in the administration of adjuvant radiation or chemoradiation between the two cohorts. Patients in the locally-advanced disease cohort were significantly more likely to have Stage II/III disease by clinical and pathologic criteria by American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition criteria (p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in 5-year overall survival (OS) or recurrence-free survival (RFS) based on Kaplan-Meier survival estimates between the two cohorts (p = 0.75, 0.6, respectively), with estimated OS of 91% at 5 years, and estimated RFS of 86% at 5 years across the study population. CONCLUSIONS: Up-front TORS offers favorable survival outcomes for appropriately selected locally-advanced cases of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer. Furthermore, up-front TORS is comparably effective in allowing avoidance of adjuvant therapy, particularly chemotherapy, in both cT1/T2 and locally-advanced HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer. In the absence of clear technical contraindication to surgery, cT3/T4 classification should not be considered an absolute contraindication to surgery.","Yver, Christina M; Shimunov, David; Weinstein, Gregory S; Rajasekaran, Karthik; Cannady, Steven B; Lukens, John N; Lin, Alexander; Swisher-McClure, Samuel; Cohen, Roger B; Aggarwal, Charu; Bauml, Joshua M; Loevner, Laurie A; Newman, Jason G; Chalian, Ara A; Rassekh, Christopher H; Basu, Devraj; O039,; Malley, Bert W; Brody, Robert M",Oral Oncol,255,20

Initially, we observed increased ADCP with ibrutinib, whilst second generation BTK inhibitors failed to synergistically interact with monoclonal antibody treatment. Kinase activity profiling under BTK inhibition identified significant loss of Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) only under ibrutinib treatment. We validated this potential off-target effect via JAK inhibition in vitro as well as with CRISPR/Cas9 JAK2-/- experiments in vivo, showing increased ADCP and prolonged survival, respectively.

One hundred and fifty-eight patients from two hospitals were enrolled to identify the indicators of severe COVID-19 and observe the natural course of COVID-19 patients without clinical intervention. The total computed tomography (CT) score, a quantitative score based on assessment of the number, quadrant, and area of the lesions in CT, tended to perform better than assessment based only on the number or area of the lesions (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.0887, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression showed that the total CT score, chest tightness, lymphocyte, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were independent factors for severe COVID-19.

Vitamin D reduces proinflammatory cytokines, and has the possibility of reducing complications from respiratory tract illnesses. METHOD: This was a retrospective, observational, cohort study of patients with COVID-19 disease within a New York City Health System. Adult patients were included if they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and had a serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level (25(OH)D) within the three previous months prior to their detected SARS-CoV-2 test. Patients were compared and evaluated based upon their 25(OH)D levels. The primary endpoints were hospitalization, need for oxygen support, and 90-day mortality. RESULTS: 437 COVID-19 patients were included [67 (IQR: 56-79) years] within this cohort. Deficient plasma 25(OH)D levels (<20 ng/ml) were associated with an increased likelihood of oxygen support [OR:2.23 (95% CI: 1.46-3.44, p = 0.0002)] from COVID-19. Deficient plasma 25(OH)D levels were not independently associated with 90-day mortality or risk of hospitalization. Hospitalization rates (98%), oxygen support (93%), and mortality rates (49%) were highest in patients who had 25(OH)D levels less than 10 ng/ml when compared to other 25(OH)D levels.

We study the ratio of new diagnoses between 2019 and 2020 and find an average decline of 31.1% in new diagnoses, with substantial drops in April (61.1%), May (55.6%), and November (52%). Neoplasms experience the largest decline (49.7%), with heterogeneity in the magnitudes of the declines across different types of cancer diagnoses. While we find evidence of temporal variation in new diagnoses, reductions in diagnoses early in the year are not recouped by the year end.

Our findings provide a year-end summary of the impact of the pandemic on healthcare activities and can help guide health authorities to design evidence-based plans to target under-diagnosed conditions in 2021.","Pifarré I Arolas, Héctor; Vidal-Alaball, Josep; Gil, Joan; López, Francesc; Nicodemo, Catia; Saez, Marc",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),255,16

METHOD: Data were from 29,148 adults participating in the Covid-19 Social Study in September-October 2020. Linear regression analyses examined associations between smoking status (current/former/never) and four types of general negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial logistic regression examined associations between smoking status and uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for Covid-19. Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics and diagnosed health conditions. RESULTS: Relative to never and former smokers, current smokers reported significantly greater mistrust of vaccine benefit, were more worried about unforeseen future effects, had greater concerns about commercial profiteering, and had a stronger preference for natural immunity (Badjs 0.16-0.36, p<0.001). Current smokers were more likely to be uncertain (27.6% vs. 22.7% of never smokers: RRadj 1.43 [95%CI 1.31-1.56]; vs. 19.3% of former smokers: RRadj 1.55 [1.41-1.73]) or unwilling (21.5% vs. 11.6% of never smokers: RRadj 2.12 [1.91-2.34]; vs. 14.7% of former smokers: RRadj 1.53 [1.37-1.71]) to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Current smokers hold more negative attitudes towards vaccines in general, and are more likely to be undecided or unwilling to vaccinate against Covid-19, compared with never and former smokers. With a disproportionately high number of smokers belonging to socially clustered and disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, lower vaccine uptake in this group could also exacerbate health inequalities. IMPLICATIONS: These results suggest that without intervention, smokers will be less likely than non-smokers to take up the offer of a Covid-19 vaccine when offered. Targeted policy action may be required to ensure low uptake of Covid-19 vaccination programmes does not compound health inequalities between smokers and non-smokers.","Jackson, Sarah E; Paul, Elise; Brown, Jamie; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",Nicotine tob. res,255,24

Objective: To review current evidence on air contamination with SARS-CoV-2 in hospital settings and the factors associated with contamination, including viral load and particle size. Evidence Review: The MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases were systematically queried for original English-language articles detailing SARS-CoV-2 air contamination in hospital settings between January 1 and October 27, 2020. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and culture were described and compared according to the setting, clinical context, air ventilation system, and distance from patients. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies per meter cubed of air were pooled, and their distribution was described by hospital areas. Particle sizes and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies or median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per meter cubed were analyzed after categorization as less than 1 µm, from 1 to 4 µm, and greater than 4 µm. Findings: Among 2284 records identified, 24 cross-sectional observational studies were included in the review. Overall, 82 of 471 air samples (17.4%) from close patient environments were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with a significantly higher positivity rate in intensive care unit settings (intensive care unit, 27 of 107 [25.2%] vs non-intensive care unit, 39 of 364 [10.7%]; P < .001). There was no difference according to the distance from patients (&#8804;1 m, 3 of 118 [2.5%] vs >1-5 m, 13 of 236 [5.5%]; P = .22). The positivity rate was 5 of 21 air samples (23.8%) in toilets, 20 of 242 (8.3%) in clinical areas, 15 of 122 (12.3%) in staff areas, and 14 of 42 (33.3%) in public areas. A total of 81 viral cultures were performed across 5 studies, and 7 (8.6%) from 2 studies were positive, all from close patient environments. The median (interquartile range) SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations varied from 1.0 × 103 copies/m3 (0.4 × 103 to 3.1 × 103 copies/m3) in clinical areas to 9.7 × 103 copies/m3 (5.1 × 103 to 14.3 × 103 copies/m3) in the air of toilets or bathrooms. Protective equipment removal and patient rooms had high concentrations per titer of SARS-CoV-2 (varying from 0.9 × 103 to 40 × 103 copies/m3 and 3.8 × 103 to 7.2 × 103 TCID50/m3), with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the region of particle size less than 1 µm; staff offices had peaks in the region of particle size greater than 4 µm. Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review, the air close to and distant from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 was frequently contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA; however, few of these samples contained viable viruses. High viral loads found in toilets and bathrooms, staff areas, and public hallways suggest that these areas should be carefully considered.","Birgand, Gabriel; Peiffer-Smadja, Nathan; Fournier, Sandra; Kerneis, Solen; Lescure, François-Xavier; Lucet, Jean-Christophe",JAMA Netw Open,255,16

The chest X-ray (CXR) is one of the alternatives to achieve fast diagnosis but the unavailability of large scale annotated data makes the clinical implementation of machine learning-based COVID detection methods difficult. Another important issue is the usage of ImageNet pre-trained networks which does not guarantee to extract reliable feature representations. In this paper, we propose the use of hierarchical convolutional network (HCN) architecture to naturally augment the data along with diversified features. The HCN uses the first convolution layer from COVIDNet followed by the convolutional layers from well known pre-trained networks to extract the features. The use of the convolution layer from COVIDNet ensures the extraction of representations relevant to the CXR modality. We also propose the use of ECOC for encoding multiclass problems to binary classification for improving the recognition performance. Experimental results show that HCN architecture is capable of achieving better results in comparison to the existing studies. The proposed method can accurately triage potential COVID-19 patients through CXR images for sharing the testing load and increasing the testing capacity.","Dev, Kapal; Khowaja, Sunder Ali; Jaiswal, Aman; Bist, Ankur Singh; Saini, Vaibhav; Bhatia, Surbhi",,255,26

This paper aims to describe different aspects of critical care in the FTA. For this, we reviewed official information about population size and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity in the FTA and literature on FTA ICU specificities. Persons living in or visiting the FTA are exposed to specific risks, mainly severe road traffic injuries, envenoming, stab or ballistic wounds, and emergent tropical infectious diseases. These diseases may require specific knowledge and critical care management. However, there are not enough ICU beds in the FTA. Indeed, there are 7.2 ICU beds/100 000 population in Guadeloupe, 7.2 in Martinique, and 4.5 in French Guiana. In addition, seriously ill patients in remote areas regularly have to be transferred, most often by helicopter, resulting in a delay in admission to intensive care. The COVID-19 crisis has shown that the health care system in the FTA is unready to face such an epidemic and that intensive care bed capacity must be increased. In conclusion, the critical care sector in the FTA requires upgrading of infrastructure, human resources, and equipment as well as enhancement of multidisciplinary care. Also needed are promotion of training, research, and regional and international medical and scientific cooperation.","Kallel, Hatem; Resiere, Dabor; Houcke, Stéphanie; Hommel, Didier; Pujo, Jean Marc; Martino, Frederic; Carles, Michel; Mehdaoui, Hossein; Medicine, Antilles-Guyane Association of Critical Care",Rev. panam. salud pública,255,1

Some of these compounds have displayed promising results in successful Phase I, II, III and IV clinical trials. Additionally, the cyanobacterial compounds applied to medical research have demonstrated an exciting future with great potential to be developed into new medicines. Most of these compounds have exhibited strong pharmacological activities, including neurotoxicity, cytotoxicity and antiviral activity against HCMV, HSV-1, HHV-6 and HIV-1, so these metabolites could be promising candidates for COVID-19 treatment. Therefore, the effective large-scale production of natural marine products through synthesis is important for resolving the existing issues associated with chemical isolation, including small yields, and may be necessary to better investigate their biological activities. Herein, we highlight the total synthesized and stereochemical determinations of the cyanobacterial bioactive compounds.

In Germany, they include antenatal classes, breastfeeding classes and pregnancy-specific yoga or gymnastics courses. Studies suggest that various types of non-medical ANC carry benefits for both the women and their babies. Little is known about the uptake of non-medical ANC among different socioeconomic population subgroups, but one may expect lower utilization among socio-economically disadvantaged women. We analyzed factors contributing to the utilization of non-medical ANC in general and antenatal classes in particular. METHODS: Baseline data of the Bielefeld BaBi birth cohort (2013-2016) and the Berlin perinatal study (2011-2012) were analyzed. Comparing the two cohorts allowed to increase the socio-economic and migration background variance of the study population and to capture the effect of the local context on uptake of services. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to study associations between the uptake of non-medical ANC and socio-economic and migration status. RESULTS: In Berlin and Bielefeld, being a first generation migrant and having lower levels of education were associated with lower non-medical ANC uptake. In Berlin, being a 2nd generation woman or having a low income was also associated with lower uptake. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: Our study suggests that non-medical ANC remains in some part the prerogative of non-migrant, well-educated and economically privileged women. Since differences in non-medical ANC have the potential to create inequalities in terms of birth outcomes and maternal health during pregnancy and post-partum, more efforts are needed to promote the use of non-medical ANC by all population groups.","Ludwig, Angelique; Miani, Céline; Breckenkamp, Jürgen; Sauzet, Odile; Borde, Theda; Doyle, Ina-Merle; Brenne, Silke; Höller-Holtrichter, Chantal; David, Matthias; Spallek, Jacob; Razum, Oliver",Matern. child health j,255,20

OBJECTIVE: Using a patient-centered approach, we explored the experiences and needs of people living with dementia and their care partners during the COVID-19 pandemic as part of an ongoing evaluation of dementia support services in British Columbia, Canada. METHODS: A survey instrument was developed around the priorities identified in the context of the COVID-19 and Dementia Task Force convened by the Alzheimer Society of Canada. RESULTS: A total of 417 surveys were analyzed. Overall, respondents were able to access information that was helpful for maintaining their own health and managing a period of social distancing. Care partners reported a number of serious concerns, including the inability to visit the person that they care for in long-term or palliative care. Participants also reported that the pandemic increased their levels of stress overall and that they felt lonelier and more isolated than they did before the pandemic. The use of technology was reported as a way to connect socially with their loved ones, with the majority of participants connecting with others at least twice per week.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) received an Emergency Use Authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). CCP with a signal-to-cutoff ratio of &gt;= 12 using the Ortho VITROS severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) test (OVSARS2IgG) is permitted to be labeled ""high titer."" Little is known about the relationship between OVSARS2IgG ratio and neutralizing capacity of plasma/sera against genuine SARS-CoV-2. Methods. Nine hundred eighty-one samples from 196 repeat CCP donors 0-119 days post-initial donation (DPID) were analyzed. Neutralizing capacity was assessed for 50% (PRNT50) and 90% (PRNT90) reduction of infectious virus using the gold standard plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). A subset of 91 donations was evaluated by OVSARS2IgG and compared to PRNT titers for diagnostic accuracy. Results. Of donations, 32.7%/79.5% (PRNT90/PRNT50) met a 1:80 titer initially but only 14.0%/48.8% (PRNT90/PRNT50) met this cutoff &gt;= 85 DPID. Correlation of OVSARS2IgG results to neutralizing capacity allowed extrapolation to CCP therapy results. CCP with OVSARS2IgG ratios equivalent to a therapeutically beneficial group had neutralizing titers of &gt;= 1:640 (PRNT50) and/or &gt;= 1:80 (PRNT90). Specificity and positive predictive value of the OVSARS2IgG for qualifying highly neutralizing CCP was optimal using ratios significantly greater than the FDA cutoff. Conclusions. This information provides a basis for refining the recommended properties of CCP used to treat COVID-19.","Girardin, R. C.; Dupuis, A. P.; Payne, A. F.; Sullivan, T. J.; Strauss, D.; Parker, M.

However, such restrictions could precipitate unintended negative consequences on lifestyle behaviors. The main objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence and determinants of unhealthy behavior changes during the COVID-19 lockdown among residents of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods: A cross-sectional web-based survey of adults residing in the UAE was carried out during lockdown (n = 2060). Using a multi-component questionnaire, the collected data included questions regarding the following lifestyle changes: Increased dietary intake, increased weight, decreased physical activity, decreased sleep, and increased smoking. An unhealthy lifestyle change score was calculated based on the number of unhealthy lifestyle changes each participant reported. In addition, sociodemographic and living conditions information was collected. Descriptive statistics as well as simple and multiple linear regression analyses were used to examine the prevalence and determinants of the unhealthy lifestyle changes considered in this study. Results: Among the unhealthy lifestyle changes examined, increased food intake was the most common (31.8%), followed by decreased physical activity (30%), increased weight (29.4%), decreased sleep (20.8%), and increased smoking (21%). In addition to identifying the correlates of each of the aforementioned lifestyle changes, the results of the multiple regression linear analyses revealed the following correlates for the overall unhealthy lifestyle change score: females (ß = 0.32, CI: 0.22; 0.42), living in an apartment (ß = 0.12, CI: 0.003; 0.23) and being overweight/obese (ß = 0.24, CI: 0.15; 0.32) had higher scores, while older adults (>40 years) had lower scores (ß = -0.23, CI: -0.34; -0.12). Conclusions: The COVID-19 lockdown has resulted in a high prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and practices among UAE residents. The findings of this study provided the evidence base for officials to design interventions targeting high-risk groups and aiming to improve healthy lifestyle factors among residents during the pandemic.","Radwan, Hadia; Al Kitbi, Mahra; Hasan, Hayder; Al Hilali, Marwa; Abbas, Nada; Hamadeh, Rena; Saif, Eman Rashid; Naja, Farah",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),255,24

With the pandemic and a worrying global recession as a result of COVID-19, our ability to achieve the 17 United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the post-pandemic era has been questioned. There is concern that the economic stagnation caused by COVID-19 will not only push more populations below the poverty line but also limit international support to ensure progress toward achieving the SDGs in Africa. This article highlights how the COVID-19 pandemic could threaten the actualization of the SDGs in Africa. We assessed relevant published literature, observations, and current global trends. Our results suggest that although the improvement of healthcare systems has become a priority in Africa, there is a need to ensure that some SDGs are not sacrificed to achieve control of the pandemic.

However, their wide adoption is hindered by a number of software and hardware limitations. The existing general-purpose hardware platforms used to accelerate DNNs are facing new challenges associated with the growing amount of data and are exponentially increasing the complexity of computations. An emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) devices and processing-in-memory (PIM) paradigm is creating a new hardware architecture generation with increased computing and storage capabilities. In particular, the shift towards ReRAM-based in-memory computing has great potential in the implementation of area and power efficient inference and in training large-scale neural network architectures. These can accelerate the process of the IoT-enabled AI technologies entering our daily life. In this survey, we review the state-of-the-art ReRAM-based DNN many-core accelerators, and their superiority compared to CMOS counterparts was shown. The review covers different aspects of hardware and software realization of DNN accelerators, their present limitations, and future prospectives. In particular, comparison of the accelerators shows the need for the introduction of new performance metrics and benchmarking standards. In addition, the major concerns regarding the efficient design of accelerators include a lack of accuracy in simulation tools for software and hardware co-design.","Smagulova, Kamilya; Fouda, Mohammed E.; Kurdahi, Fadi; Salama, Khaled; Eltawil, Ahmed",,255,20

A biopsychosocial-spiritual approach to health management may be beneficial. Primary Study Objective * To assess the effect of gentle yoga and mindfulness meditation on spiritual well-being in cancer survivors. Methods/Design * This is a mixed methods, quasiexperimental pilot study providing 10 weeks of gentle yoga and mindfulness meditation twice per week to cancer survivors. Setting * The intervention was provided at a South Florida university in the summer months. Participants * Ten cancer survivors self-selected to participate in the 10-week study;2 participants did not complete the post-test data collection. Intervention * Each class opened and closed with 5 to 6 minutes of nonmoving mindfulness meditation. The mindfulness meditation techniques included body scan, breath awareness, visualization, affirmation, and compassion meditations. The gentle yoga practice was a series of beginner yoga postures and stretches. The mindfulness meditation techniques of breath and body awareness during yoga created what is referred to as a ""moving meditation"" with yoga postures encompassing the movement portion. Primary Outcome Measures * The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Spiritual Well-Being 12 Item Scale (FACIT-Sp-12) and 2 open-ended questions. Results * The FACIT-Sp-12 pre- and post-test data were analyzed using a paired samples t test. There was a significant improvement in overall spiritual well-being from pretest (д = 34.25, SD = 7.28) to post-test (д = 39.50, SD = 7.91);t (7) = -4.02, P = 0.003. Qualitative data: the participants reported improvements in various aspects of spirituality, fitness, emotional well-being, stress management, sleep, and a sense of social connectedness. Conclusion * The biopsychosocial-spiritual approach to health care may play a vital role in addressing the wellbeing of the whole person. Gentle yoga and mindfulness meditation can result in improvement in measures of spiritual well-being among cancer survivors and may be further utilized as an accessible intervention for those who are suffering throughout all segments of society.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed among adult patients admitted to a quaternary care center in New York City between March 1 and April 3, 2020. Patients were included if they underwent TTE during the hospitalization after a known positive diagnosis for COVID-19. Demographic and clinical data were obtained using chart abstraction from the electronic medical record. RESULTS: Of 749 patients, 72 (9.6%) underwent TTE following positive results on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 polymerase chain reaction testing. The most common clinical indications for TTE were concern for a major acute cardiovascular event (45.8%) and hemodynamic instability (29.2%). Although most patients had preserved biventricular function, 34.7% were found to have left ventricular ejection fractions &#8804; 50%, and 13.9% had at least moderately reduced right ventricular function. Four patients had wall motion abnormalities suggestive of stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Using Spearman rank correlation, there was an inverse relationship between high-sensitivity troponin T and left ventricular ejection fraction (&#961; = -0.34, P = .006). Among 20 patients with prior echocardiograms, only two (10%) had new reductions in LVEF of >10%. Clinical management was changed in eight individuals (24.2%) in whom TTE was ordered for concern for acute major cardiovascular events and three (14.3%) in whom TTE was ordered for hemodynamic evaluation.

We constructed receiver-operating characteristic curves, calculated diagnostic parameters, and developed a multivariable model for predicting adverse outcome. RESULTS: We analysed data from 817 patients with post-exertion oxygen saturation recorded after excluding 54 in whom measurement appeared unfeasible. The c-statistic for post-exertion change in oxygen saturation was 0.589 (95% CI 0.465 to 0.713), and the positive and negative likelihood ratios of a 3% or more desaturation were, respectively, 1.78 (1.25 to 2.53) and 0.67 (0.46 to 0.98). Multivariable analysis showed that post-exertion oxygen saturation was not a significant predictor of adverse outcome when baseline clinical assessment was taken into account (p=0.368). Secondary analysis excluding patients in whom post-exertion measurement appeared inappropriate resulted in a c-statistic of 0.699 (0.581 to 0.817), likelihood ratios of 1.98 (1.26 to 3.10) and 0.61 (0.35 to 1.07), and some evidence of additional prognostic value on multivariable analysis (p=0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Post-exertion oxygen saturation provides modest prognostic information in the assessment of selected patients attending the emergency department with suspected COVID-19.

Here, we show that thiol-based mucolytic agents, P2119 and P2165, potently inhibit infection by human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and decrease the binding of spike glycoprotein to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Proteomics and reactive cysteine profiling link the antiviral activity of repurposed mucolytic agents to the reduction of key disulfides, specifically, by disruption of the Cys379-Cys432 and Cys391-Cys525 pairs distal to the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein. Computational analyses provide insight into conformation changes that occur when these disulfides break or form, consistent with an allosteric role, and indicate that P2119/P2165 target a conserved hydrophobic binding pocket in the RBD with the benzyl thiol warhead pointed directly towards Cys432. These collective findings establish the vulnerability of human coronaviruses to repurposed thiol-based mucolytics and lay the groundwork for developing these compounds as a potential treatment, preventative and/or adjuvant against infection.","Shi, Yunlong; Zeida, Ari; Edwards, Caitlin E; Mallory, Michael L; Sastre, Santiago; Machado, Matias R; Pickles, Raymond J; Fu, Ling; Liu, Keke; Yang, Jing; Boucher, Richard C; Radi, Rafael; Carroll, Kate S",,255,10

SARS CoV-2 is an enveloped, single stranded RNA virus that depends on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to replicate. Therefore, SARS CoV-2 RdRp is considered as a promising target to cease virus replication. SARS CoV-2 polymerase shows high structural similarity to Hepatitis C Virus-1b genotype (HCV-1b) polymerase. Arising from the high similarity between SARS CoV-2 RdRp and HCV NS5B, we utilized the reported small-molecule binders to the palm subdomain of HCV NS5B (genotype 1b) to generate a high-quality DEKOIS 2.0 benchmark set and conducted a benchmarking analysis against HCV NS5B. The three highly cited and publicly available docking tools AutoDock Vina, FRED and PLANTS were benchmarked. Based on the benchmarking results and analysis via pROC-Chemotype plot, PLANTS showed the best screening performance and can recognize potent binders at the early enrichment. Accordingly, we used PLANTS in a prospective virtual screening to repurpose both the FDA-approved drugs (DrugBank) and the HCV-NS5B palm subdomain binders (BindingDB) for SARS CoV-2 RdRp palm subdomain. Further assessment by molecular dynamics simulations for 50 ns recommended diosmin (from DrugBank) and compound 3 (from BindingDB) to be the best potential binders to SARS CoV-2 RdRp palm subdomain. The best predicted compounds are recommended to be biologically investigated against COVID-19. In conclusion, this work provides in-silico analysis to propose possible SARS CoV-2 RdRp palm subdomain binders recommended as a remedy for COVID-19. Up-to-our knowledge, this study is the first to propose binders at the palm subdomain of SARS CoV2 RdRp. Furthermore, this study delivers an example of how to make use of a high quality custom-made DEKOIS 2.0 benchmark set as a procedure to elevate the virtual screening success rate against a vital target of the rapidly emerging pandemic.","Elghoneimy, Laila K; Ismail, Muhammad I; Boeckler, Frank M; Azzazy, Hassan M E; Ibrahim, Tamer M",Comput Biol Med,255,0

This study employed a survey design to assess parental perspectives on the impact of school closures and of returning to school in England, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Eighty-three parents of children and young people with various types of need responded to the survey between September and December 2020. The survey included multiple choice questions and open-ended questions for further in-depth examination of parental perspectives. Results show that: the majority of parents reported that school closures had a detrimental effect on their children’s mental health (particularly those from the most deprived neighbourhoods) and on their own mental and physical health (particularly for ethnically diverse parents and for those whose children attend specialized settings);returning to school was considered to have a positive impact on children’s mental and physical health for the vast majority of parents, despite fearing exposure to the virus;many parents have reported that their children were calmer and happier at home during school closures and became more anxious and stressed upon returning to school.

The online survey was conducted from June 17 to 29, 2020. Respondents reported the frequency of travel before the pandemic, during the pandemic, and anticipated travel when normal activities resume for walking, bicycling, personal vehicle use, and public transit. Analyses were conducted in July and August 2020. RESULTS: During the pandemic, local travel significantly decreased (-10.36%, 95% CI= -16.26, -4.02) relative to prepandemic levels. Within travel modes, significant decreases were reported for public transit, personal vehicle use, and walking. There was no change in reported bicycle use during the pandemic period relative to prepandemic levels. When normal activities resume, respondents anticipated a significant increase in bicycling (24.54%, 95% CI=3.24, 50.24). Anticipated travel using personal vehicles, public transit, and walking were not significantly different from the prepandemic levels. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike the other local travel modes, bicycling did not decrease during the pandemic and is anticipated to significantly increase.

Thereby, cardiovascular comorbidity has a major impact on mortality. We investigated whether coronary calcification as a marker for coronary artery disease (CAD) is appropriate for risk prediction in COVID-19. METHODS: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n = 109) were analyzed regarding clinical outcome after native computed tomography (CT) imaging for COVID-19 screening. CAC (coronary calcium score) and clinical outcome (need for intensive care treatment or death) data were calculated following a standardized protocol. We defined three endpoints: critical COVID-19 and transfer to ICU, fatal COVID-19 and death, composite endpoint critical and fatal COVID-19, a composite of ICU treatment and death. We evaluated the association of clinical outcome with the CAC. Patients were dichotomized by the median of CAC. Hazard ratios and odds ratios were calculated for the events death or ICU or a composite of death and ICU. RESULTS: We observed significantly more events for patients with CAC above the group's median of 31 for critical outcome (HR: 1.97[1.09,3.57], p = 0.026), for fatal outcome (HR: 4.95[1.07,22.9], p = 0.041) and the composite endpoint (HR: 2.31[1.28,4.17], p = 0.0056. Also, odds ratio was significantly increased for critical outcome (OR: 3.01 [1.37, 6.61], p = 0.01) and for fatal outcome (OR: 5.3 [1.09, 25.8], p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The results indicate a significant association between CAC and clinical outcome in COVID-19. Our data therefore suggest that CAC might be useful in risk prediction in patients with COVID-19.","Zimmermann, Gregor S; Fingerle, Alexander A; Müller-Leisse, Christina; Gassert, Felix; von Schacky, Claudio E; Ibrahim, Tareq; Laugwitz, Karl-Ludwig; Geisler, Fabian; Spinner, Christoph; Haller, Bernhard; Makowski, Markus R; Nadjiri, Jonathan",PLoS One,255,16

The primary outcome of severe COVID-19 was defined by respiratory rate &#8805;30, SpO2 &#8804;93% or intensive care unit admission. The association between clinical factors on severe COVID-19 outcome was analyzed by cox regression. Adjusted mediation analysis of C-reactive protein (CRP) on the relationship between diabetes and severe COVID-19 was performed. Of 1042 hospitalized patients, mean age 39 ± 11 years, 13% had diabetes, 9% prediabetes and 78% normoglycemia. Severe COVID-19 occurred in 4.9% of subjects. Compared to normoglycemia, diabetes was significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on both univariate (hazard ratio [HR]: 9.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.54-17.84; p < .001) and multivariate analysis (HR: 3.99; 95% CI: 1.92-8.31; p < .001), while prediabetes was not a risk factor (HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.22-4.03; p = .929). CRP, a biomarker of inflammation, mediated 32.7% of the total association between diabetes and severe COVID-19 outcome. In conclusion, CRP is a partial mediator of the association between diabetes and severe COVID-19 infection, confirming that inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 in diabetes.","Koh, Huilin; Moh, Angela Mei Chung; Yeoh, Ester; Lin, Yi; Low, Serena Kiat Mun; Ooi, Say Tat; Tan, Seng Kiong; Lin, Jaime Hui Xian; Hoong, Caroline Wei Shan",J Med Virol,255,16

The aim of our study was to compare the number of acute appendicitis cases and the proportion of complicated appendicitis before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all data collected from a multi-center database of patients presenting to the emergency department for acute appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 12 to June 6, 2020, and compared these data with those from the same periods in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The number of acute appendicitis cases, proportion of complicated appendicitis, and pre- and postoperative patient characteristics were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 306 patients were included in this evaluation. Sixty-five patients presented during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (group A), and 241 patients in previous years (group B: 2017-2019). The number of consultations for acute appendicitis decreased by almost 20 percent during the pandemic compared with previous periods, with a significant increase in complicated appendicitis (52% in group A versus 20% in group B, p < 0,001.). Comparing the two groups, significant differences were also noted in the duration of symptoms (symptoms > 48h in 61% and 26%, p < 0,001), the intervention time (77 vs 61 minutes, p = 0,002), length of hospital stay (hospitalization of > 2 days in 63% and 32%, p < 0.001) and duration of antibiotic treatment (antibiotics > 3 days in 36% and 24% p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decreased number of consultations for acute appendicitis, with a higher proportion of complicated appendicitis, most likely due to patient delay in consulting the emergency department at symptom onset. Patients and general practitioners should be aware of this problem to avoid a time delay from initial symptoms to consultation.","Burgard, Marie; Cherbanyk, Floryn; Nassiopoulos, Konstantinos; Malekzadeh, Sonaz; Pugin, François; Egger, Bernhard",PLoS One,255,16

METHODS: Baseline survey was conducted from February 10, 2020 to February 25, 2020 in patients with COVID-19 in a designated hospital on the discharge day. After discharge, patients were free to choose whether isolate in a centralized isolation site (i.e. designated hotel) or their own home for another two weeks. A follow-up survey was conducted at the end of the 2-week post-discharge isolation. Depression, anxiety as well as self-rated health were assessed at both time points using the 9-item patient health questionnaire, 7-item generalized anxiety disorder scale and self-rated health scores, respectively. RESULTS: Fifty centrally isolated and 45 home isolated patients completed both the baseline and the follow-up assessments. Significant effects of time and time by isolation form were found on depression and anxiety levels, with a significant decrease in depression and anxiety shown in home isolated but not in centrally isolated patients. Besides, a significant time effect was identified on self-rated health with significant improvement found in home isolated but not in centrally isolated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Home isolation is superior to centralized isolation in the recovery of COVID-19-associated depression, anxiety as well as self-rated health. More attention needs to be paid to the psychological well-being of centrally isolated patients. A sustained and integrated rehabilitation plan is warranted for patients with COVID-19 to achieve both physical and psychological recovery.","Ju, Yumeng; Chen, Wentao; Liu, Jin; Yang, Aiping; Shu, Kongliang; Zhou, Yun; Wang, Mi; Huang, Mei; Liao, Mei; Liu, Jiyang; Liu, Bangshan; Zhang, Yan",J Psychosom Res,255,22

The Italian government was forced to introduce quarantine measures quickly, and all elective health services were stopped or postponed. This emergency has dramatically changed the management of paediatric and adult patients with congenital heart disease. We analysed data from 14 Italian congenital cardiac surgery centres during lockdown, focusing on the impact of the pandemic on surgical activity, patients and healthcare providers and resource allocation. METHODS: Fourteen centres participated in this study. The period analysed was from 9 March to 4 May. We collected data on the involvement of the hospitals in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and on limitations on regular activity and on the contagion among patients and healthcare providers. RESULTS: Four hospitals (29%) remained COVID-19 free, whereas 10 had a 39% reduction in the number of beds for surgical patients, especially in the northern area. Two hundred sixty-three surgical procedures were performed: 20% elective, 62% urgent, 10% emergency and 3% life-saving. Hospital mortality was 0.4%. Compared to 2019, the reduction in surgical activity was 52%. No patients operated on had positive test results before surgery for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. Three patients were infected during the postoperative period. Twenty-nine nurses and 12 doctors were infected. Overall, 80% of our infected healthcare providers were in northern centres.

There is good evidence that ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and high expression of ACE2 may increase susceptibility to infection. We aimed to explore risk factors affecting susceptibility to infection and prioritize drug repositioning candidates, based on Mendelian randomization (MR) studies on ACE2 lung expression. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a phenome-wide MR study to prioritize diseases/traits and blood proteins causally linked to ACE2 lung expression in GTEx. We also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in MR, as these drugs may alter ACE2 expression and may be clinically relevant. RESULTS: The most consistent finding was tentative evidence of an association between diabetes-related traits and increased ACE2 expression. Based on one of the largest genome-wide association studies on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to date (N = 898,130), T2DM was causally linked to raised ACE2 expression (P = 2.91E-03; MR-IVW). Significant associations (at nominal level; P < 0.05) with ACE2 expression were observed across multiple diabetes data sets and analytic methods for T1DM, T2DM, and related traits including early start of insulin. Other diseases/traits having nominal significant associations with increased expression included inflammatory bowel disease, (estrogen receptor-positive) breast cancer, lung cancer, asthma, smoking, and elevated alanine aminotransferase. We also identified drugs that may target the top-ranked proteins in MR, such as fostamatinib and zinc. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggested that diabetes and related traits may increase ACE2 expression, which may influence susceptibility to infection (or more severe infection). However, none of these findings withstood rigorous multiple testing corrections (at false discovery rate <0.05). Proteome-wide MR analyses might help uncover mechanisms underlying ACE2 expression and guide drug repositioning. Further studies are required to verify our findings.","Rao, Shitao; Lau, Alexandria; So, Hon-Cheong",Diabetes Care,255,16

METHODS: In April 2020, a cross-sectional survey among PLWH was conducted using a web-based multilingual questionnaire. The research tool assessed HIV follow-up, psychosocial well-being, COVID-19 (flu-like) symptoms and prevention measures. Consenting respondents provided answers anonymously. RESULTS: Three hundred seventeen PLWH were included (mean age 43.4 ± 11.7; 71.6% men); 60.3% of participants resided in Belgium and Brazil. One hundred forty (44.2%) reported experiencing a cold with at least one flu-like symptom since January 2020. Of the 18 who reported COVID-19 test results, 4 (22.2%) were positive. Seventy-four (23.3%) respondents screened positive for major depressive disorders, whereas 72 (22.7%) had generalized anxiety disorders.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantify the associations of coronavirus disease 2019 with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancy and to characterize the epidemiology and risk factors. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a matched case-control study of pregnant patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 cases who delivered between 16 and 41 weeks' gestation from March 11 to June 11, 2020. Uninfected pregnant women (controls) were matched to coronavirus disease 2019 cases on a 2:1 ratio based on delivery date. Maternal demographic characteristics, coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms, laboratory evaluations, obstetrical and neonatal outcomes, and clinical management were chart abstracted. The primary outcomes included (1) a composite of adverse maternal outcome, defined as preeclampsia, venous thromboembolism, antepartum admission, maternal intensive care unit admission, need for mechanical ventilation, supplemental oxygen, or maternal death, and (2) a composite of adverse neonatal outcome, defined as respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, 5-minute Apgar score of <5, persistent category 2 fetal heart rate tracing despite intrauterine resuscitation, or neonatal death. To quantify the associations between exposure to mild and severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 and adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, unadjusted and adjusted analyses were performed using conditional logistic regression (to account for matching), with matched-pair odds ratio and 95% confidence interval based on 1000 bias-corrected bootstrap resampling as the effect measure. Associations were adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 61 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 cases were enrolled during the study period (mild disease, n=54 [88.5%]; severe disease, n=6 [9.8%]; critical disease, n=1 [1.6%]). The odds of adverse composite maternal outcome were 3.4 times higher among cases than controls (18.0% vs 8.2%; adjusted odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-13.4).

Stratified analyses by disease severity indicated that the morbidity associated with coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy was largely driven by the severe or critical disease phenotype. Major risk factors for associated morbidity were black and Hispanic race, advanced maternal age, medical comorbidities, and antepartum admissions related to coronavirus disease 2019. CONCLUSION: Coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, an association that is primarily driven by morbidity associated with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019. Black and Hispanic race, obesity, advanced maternal age, medical comorbidities, and antepartum admissions related to coronavirus disease 2019 are risk factors for associated morbidity.","Brandt, Justin S; Hill, Jennifer; Reddy, Ajay; Schuster, Meike; Patrick, Haylea S; Rosen, Todd; Sauer, Mark V; Boyle, Carla; Ananth, Cande V",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,255,1

Due to extremely high transmission rate, people are more susceptible to viral infection. COVID-19 patients having chronic type-2 asthma prevails a major risk as it may aggravate the disease and morbidities. OBJECTIVE: The present review mainly focuses on correlating the influence of COVID-19 in type-2 asthmatic patients. Besides, it delineates the treatment measures and drugs that can be used to manage mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of COVID-19 in asthmatic patients, thus preventing any exacerbation. METHODS: An in-depth research was carried out from different peer-reviewed articles till September 2020 from several renowned databases like PubMed, Frontier, MEDLINE, and related websites like WHO, CDC, MOHFW, and the information was analysed and written in a simplified manner. RESULTS: The progressive results were quite conflicting as severe cases of COVID-19 shows an increase in the level of several cytokines that can augment inflammation to the bronchial tracts, worsening the asthma attacks. Contradicting to this, certain findings reveal the decrease in the severity of COVID-19 due to the elevation of T-cells in type-2 asthmatic patients, as prominent reduction of T-cell is seen in most of the COVID-19 positive patients. This helps to counteract the balance of immune responses and hence ameliorate the disease progression. CONCLUSION: Asthmatic patients must remain cautious during the COVID-19 pandemic by maintaining all the precautions to stay safe due to limited research data. Future strategies should include a better understanding of asthmatic exacerbation and its relation to COVID-19.","Ghosh, Srijit; Das, Srijita; Mondal, Rupsa; Abdullah, Salik; Sultana, Shirin; Singh, Sukhbir; Sehgal, Aayush; Behl, Tapan",Int Immunopharmacol,255,32

Congruently, SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, has been demonstrated to infect the gastrointestinal tissues, and be shed in feces. In the present study, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from wastewater, sludge, surface water, ground water, sediment, and soil samples of municipal and hospital wastewater systems and related environments in Wuhan during the COVID-19 middle and low risk periods, and the viral RNA copies quantified using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). From the findings of this study, during the middle risk period, one influent sample and three secondary effluents collected from waste water treatment plant 2, as well as two samples from Jinyintan Hospital wastewater system influent were SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive. One sludge sample collected from Guanggu Branch of Tongji Hospital, which was obtained during the low risk period, was also positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These study findings demonstrate the significance of WBE in continuous surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 at the community level, even when the COVID-19 prevalence is low. Overall, this study can be used as an important reference for contingency management of wastewater treatment plants and COVID-19 prevention and control departments of Wuhan.","Zhao, Lu Atoni Evans Nyaruaba Raphael Du Yao Zhang Huaiyu Donde Oscar Huang Doudou Xiao Shuqi Ren Nanjie Ma Teng Shu Zhu Yuan Zhiming Tong Lei Xia Han",Journal of Environmental Sciences,255,16

Current evidence suggests that severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 are associated with a dysregulated immune response. However, little is known about how the innate immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we modeled SARS-CoV-2 infection using primary human airway epithelial (pHAE) cultures, which are maintained in an air-liquid interface. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in pHAE cultures and is directionally released on the apical, but not basolateral, surface. Transcriptional profiling studies found that infected pHAE cultures had a molecular signature dominated by proinflammatory cytokines and chemokine induction, including interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;), and CXCL8, and identified NF-&#954;B and ATF-4 as key drivers of this proinflammatory cytokine response. Surprisingly, we observed a complete lack of a type I or III interferon (IFN) response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, pretreatment and posttreatment with type I and III IFNs significantly reduced virus replication in pHAE cultures that correlated with upregulation of antiviral effector genes. Combined, our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 does not trigger an IFN response but is sensitive to the effects of type I and III IFNs. Our studies demonstrate the utility of pHAE cultures to model SARS-CoV-2 infection and that both type I and III IFNs can serve as therapeutic options to treat COVID-19 patients.IMPORTANCE The current pandemic of respiratory illness, COVID-19, is caused by a recently emerged coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. This virus infects airway and lung cells causing fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Severe cases of COVID-19 can result in lung damage, low blood oxygen levels, and even death. As there are currently no vaccines approved for use in humans, studies of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed. Our research identifies an excellent system to model SARS-CoV-2 infection of the human airways that can be used to test various treatments. Analysis of infection in this model system found that human airway epithelial cell cultures induce a strong proinflammatory cytokine response yet block the production of type I and III IFNs to SARS-CoV-2. However, treatment of airway cultures with the immune molecules type I or type III interferon (IFN) was able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, our model system identified type I or type III IFN as potential antiviral treatments for COVID-19 patients.","Vanderheiden, Abigail; Ralfs, Philipp; Chirkova, Tatiana; Upadhyay, Amit A; Zimmerman, Matthew G; Bedoya, Shamika; Aoued, Hadj; Tharp, Gregory M; Pellegrini, Kathryn L; Manfredi, Candela; Sorscher, Eric; Mainou, Bernardo; Lobby, Jenna L; Kohlmeier, Jacob E; Lowen, Anice C; Shi, Pei-Yong; Menachery, Vineet D; Anderson, Larry J; Grakoui, Arash; Bosinger, Steven E; Suthar, Mehul S",J. virol,255,33

METHODS: A 16-question survey was created to assess the availability and personal thoughts of healthcare professionals regarding PPE supply in England. The survey was distributed via social media (Facebook© and Twitter©) to UK COVID-19 healthcare professional groups, with responses collected over 3 weeks in March 2020 during the beginning of the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 121 responses from physicians in 35 different hospitals were collected (105 inpatient wards, 16 from intensive care units). In inpatient wards, eye and face protection were unavailable to 19% (20/105). Fluid-resistant surgical masks were available to 97% (102/105) whereas filtering facepiece class 3 (FFP3) respirator for 53% (56/105) of respondents. Gloves were accessible for all respondents (100%). Body protection was available primarily as a plastic apron 84% (88/105). All of respondents working in intensive care had access to full-body PPE, except FFP3 respirators (available in 88%, 14/16). PPE is 'Always' available for 30% (36/121) of all respondents. There was a statistically significant difference between London and non-London respondents that 'Always' had PPE available (44 versus 19%, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Our survey demonstrated an overall lack of PPE volume supply in the UK hospitals during March 2020, demonstrating a lack of preparedness for a pandemic. PPE was more readily available in London which was the epicentre of the outbreak. Eye and full body protection are in most lack of supply.","Mantelakis, Angelos; Spiers, Harry V M; Lee, Chang Woo; Chambers, Alastair; Joshi, Anil",Ann. Work Expo. Health,255,30

They completed a series of questionnaires covering demographic and work-related information, symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, social support, self-efficacy, and symptoms of insomnia and general health. Higher symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were associated with higher symptoms of insomnia and lower general health. Higher scores of depression, anxiety, and stress directly predicted higher insomnia scores and lower general health scores, while the indirect effect of social support was modest. Compared to normative data, full-time frontline hospital staff members had a 3.14 higher chance to complain about insomnia and a significantly lower general health.

The present study reviewed all studies with imaging findings presentation of LAP after COVID-19 vaccination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a literature search in online databases, including Scopus, Medline (PubMed), Web of Science, Embase (Elsevier), Cochrane library, and Google Scholar. RESULTS: A total of 19 studies (68 cases), including 60 (88.2%) females and eight (11.8%) males with a presentation of LAP after COVID-19 vaccination, were reviewed. LAP was identified after first or second dosages of three types of COVID-19 vaccines, including Pfizer-BioNTech (nâ¯=â¯30, 44.1%), Moderna (nâ¯=â¯17, 25%), and Oxford-AstraZeneca (nâ¯=â¯1, 1.5%).

AIMS: To assess the functionality, perceived safety, droplet protection and aerosol protection of several barrier techniques. METHODS: Firstly, a simulation study with 12 different laryngoscopists was conducted to assess the time taken to perform an intubation (via direct laryngoscopy, via video laryngoscopy and via a bougie) with four different barrier techniques (personal protective equipment only, a plastic sheet, a tented plastic sheet and an intubation box). Secondly, a cough at the time of intubation was simulated using ultraviolet dye to assess the spread of droplets; and thirdly, smoke was used to assess the spread of aerosols. RESULTS: Intubation time using the box was non-inferior to using no barrier. Based on subjective ratings by the laryngoscopists, the most functional technique was no barrier followed by the intubation box, then the tented sheet, then the plastic sheet. The technique that conferred the highest feeling of safety to the laryngoscopists was the intubation box, followed by the tented sheet, then no barrier and then the plastic sheet. All the barriers prevented the ultraviolet dye contaminating the head and torso of the laryngoscopist. Smoke remained within the intubation box if plastics sheets were used to cover the openings and suction was ineffective at clearing it. With no barrier in place, smoke was effectively cleared away from the patient in a theatre with laminar flow but tended to spread up toward the laryngoscopist in a room without laminar flow. CONCLUSIONS: A well-designed intubation box is an effective barrier against droplets and is non-inferior to no barrier in relation to intubation time.However, a box interferes with laminar flow in theatres with formal ventilation systems and may result in accumulation of aerosols if it is completely enclosed.","Lee-Archer, Paul; Boyd, Daniel; Du, Trung; Elliott, Robert; Graydon, Cameron; Paterson, Neil; Morawska, Lidia",Paediatr. anaesth,255,16

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey (August-October in 2020) of internal medicine physicians at two academic hospitals in Vancouver, Canada. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Physician burnout and its components, emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and personal accomplishment were measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. RESULTS: The response rate was 38% (n=302/803 respondents, 49% women,). The prevalence of burnout was 68% (emotional exhaustion 63%, depersonalisation 39%) and feeling low personal accomplishment 22%. In addition, 21% reported that they were considering quitting the profession or had quit a position. Women were more likely to report emotional exhaustion (OR 2.00, 95% CI: 1.07 to 3.73, p=0.03) and feeling low personal accomplishment (OR 2.26, 95% CI: 1.09 to 4.70, p=0.03) than men. Visible ethnic minority physicians were more likely to report feeling lower personal accomplishment than white physicians (OR 1.81, 95% CI: 1.28 to 2.55, p=0.001).

CONCLUSION: Burnout affects 2 out of 3 internal medicine physicians during the pandemic. Women, ethnic minority physicians and those who feel that COVID-19 affects burnout were more likely to report components of burnout. Further understanding of factors driving feelings of low personal accomplishment in women and ethnic minority physicians is needed.","Khan, Nadia; Palepu, Anita; Dodek, Peter; Salmon, Amy; Leitch, Heather; Ruzycki, Shannon; Townson, Andrea; Lacaille, Diane",BMJ Open,255,16

The objectives of this study were to find out if it was possible to prevent, or delay, the local outbreaks of COVID-19 through restrictions on travel from abroad and if the virus has already established in-country transmission, to what extent would its impact be mitigated through quarantine of symptomatic patients? Methods: These questions were addressed in the context of India, using simple mathematical models of infectious disease transmission. While there remained important uncertainties in the natural history of COVID-19, using hypothetical epidemic curves, some key findings were illustrated that appeared insensitive to model assumptions, as well as highlighting critical data gaps. Results: It was assumed that symptomatic quarantine would identify and quarantine 50 per cent of symptomatic individuals within three days of developing symptoms. In an optimistic scenario of the basic reproduction number (R0) being 1.5, and asymptomatic infections lacking any infectiousness, such measures would reduce the cumulative incidence by 62 per cent. In the pessimistic scenario of R0=4, and asymptomatic infections being half as infectious as symptomatic, this projected impact falls to two per cent. Interpretation & conclusions: Port-of-entry-based entry screening of travellers with suggestive clinical features and from COVID-19-affected countries, would achieve modest delays in the introduction of the virus into the community. Acting alone, however, such measures would be insufficient to delay the outbreak by weeks or longer. Once the virus establishes transmission within the community, quarantine of symptomatics may have a meaningful impact on disease burden. Model projections are subject to substantial uncertainty and can be further refined as more is understood about the natural history of infection of this novel virus. As a public health measure, health system and community preparedness would be critical to control any impending spread of COVID-19 in the country.","Mandal, Sandip; Bhatnagar, Tarun; Arinaminpathy, Nimalan; Agarwal, Anup; Chowdhury, Amartya; Murhekar, Manoj; Gangakhedkar, Raman R.; Sarkar, Swarup",Indian J.

Yet, the mere presence of these threats is not enough to automatically predispose to illness. The susceptibility of an individual to viral or bacterial infections is dependent upon immune competence. Many factors can interfere with the functioning of the immune system. Epigenetic alterations in the form of lifestyle or environmental factors can lead to impaired immunity. For example, exposure to air pollution can increase the risk of complications and mortality from COVID-19. Obesity can also exacerbate the damaging effects of air pollution on the lungs and may enhance the association between air pollution and increased COVID-19 severity. Poor sleep is another factor leading to impaired immunity, likely due to the coinciding melatonin depletion. Melatonin has been found to have antiviral and immune-enhancing effects, and it has been proposed that this hormone may be beneficial in COVID-19 patients. Zinc and vitamins D and C have also been well studied for their ability to shorten the duration of upper respiratory infections, and vitamin D has been found to reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients. Cannabidiol can both directly and indirectly improve immunity by enhancing natural killer cell activity, reducing inflammation, and relieving stress. Other dietary supplements backed by solid scientific evidence to show they act as immune enhancers are astragalus, a yeast fermentate (EpiCor®), olive leaf extract, berberine, N-acetyl cysteine, and garlic.","Meletis, Chris D.; Wilkes, Kimberly",Alternative therapies in health and medicine,255,19

Their disadvantage is linked to their lower social status and fewer social goods compared with dominant population groups.Albeit limited by methodology, early studies attribute lower uptake of COVID-19 amongst ethnic minorities to the wider determinants of vaccine uptake, hesitancy or lack of vaccine confidence, including lower levels of trust and greater concerns about vaccine safety. Early sentinel studies are needed in all early adopter countries.One emerging theme among those of reproductive age in minority communities concerns a worry regarding COVID-19 vaccine's potential adverse effect on fertility. Respected professional groups reassure this is not a credible rationale. Drug and vaccine regulators use understandable, cautious and conditional language in emergency licencing of new gene-based vaccines. Technical assessments on whether there is any potential genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity should be more emphatic.From a public health perspective, sentinel studies should identify such community concerns and act early to produce convincing explanations and evidence. Local public health workforces need to be diverse, multiskilled, and able to engage well with minorities and vulnerable groups. The local Directors of Public Health in the UK are based in each local government area and have a remit and opportunity to stimulate speedy action to increase vaccine uptake.During the rapid Pandemic Pace of the vaccines roll-out, extra efforts to minimise uptake variations are likely to achieve improvements in the next year or two. We expect variations will not disappear however, given that underlying inequalities persist in less inclusive social systems.","Reid, John A; Mabhala, Mzwandile A",Isr J Health Policy Res,255,20

The risk/benefit assessment and the main infection control policies in the clinical practices are also looked at. Expert opinion Regulatory agencies have amended their medical devices directives to address the pandemic, but each in a different way. In this exceptional situation scientist and technology experts in collaboration with medical specialists should work together to re-assess the risk analysis on medical equipment management and their use and re-use in this context with the aim to improve global health care Every effort must be made to provide the necessary devices at least with the minimum acceptable performances for Covid-19 patients while maintaining a high standard of safety for users.

When COVID-19 struck our community, our team determined that we needed to change our approach to emergent stroke cases without sacrificing efficiency and safety. Our goals with the changes in our hyperacute stroke response pathway (called Code Brain) in our ED was to minimize COVID-19 exposure to our team, reduce PPE usage, and maintain an environment of safety and readiness, all while providing the same high-quality stroke care. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if the changes we made to our Code Brain pathway in the ED effected our door-to-needle time for tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) administration our door-to-groin puncture (DTG) times, or our CT scan turn-around times (CT TAT) under 45 minutes percentage. Implementation: It was decided that the stroke team RNs would respond to the bedside and a neurology resident or fellow would respond via telemedicine robot at bedside. The stroke team nurse is the safety monitor who ensures proper PPE use. The patient is moved through the Code Brain pathway with the telemedicine robot in tow, assuring constant contact with the patient by the stroke physician and stroke nurse. We implemented our revised Code Brain pathway on March 17, 2020. We retrospectively collected data from November 2019 to July 2020 and extracted our DTN, DTG and CT TAT times for a 4 1/2 month comparison. Results: From November 2019 through March 17, 2020, our DTN median time was 39 minutes, DTG median time was 101 minutes, and CT TAT under 45 minutes was 97%. From March 18, 2020 to July 2020, our DTN median time was 54 minutes, DTG median time was 101 minutes, and CT TAT under 45 minutes was 95%. Variables to consider are the length of time it takes to apply the appropriate PPE for the stroke nurse, obtaining the telemedicine robot from our ED storage area and connectivity issues. Conclusion: Although we radically changed the way we approach our Code Brain patients, our response and treatment times changed only slightly. We will continue to streamline this process for optimal outcomes.","Steiner, N. E.; Izzo, R.; Paletz, L. B.; Robertson, B.; Wolber, N.; Guerra, S.; Song, S. S.",Stroke,255,26

METHODS: Retrospective observational study of 81 consecutive patients admitted with Covid-19 respiratory infection who underwent MDCT for clinical suspicion of PTE (sudden dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, severe respiratory failure (SRF) not corrected with high O2 flow) and/or raised D-dimer. RESULTS: Of the 81 patients studied [64 (79.01%) men], acute PTE was identified in 22 (27.16%), bilaterally in 13 (59.09%), and 13 (59,09%) showed areas of hypoperfusion. Of the 59 (72.83%) patients without PTE, hypoperfusion was observed in 41 (69.49%) (attributable in one case to pulmonary emphysema). In 18 (22.2%) of the total number of patients, neither PTE nor hypoperfusion were seen. A crazy paving pattern is a risk factor for developing PTE (OR 1.94; 95% CI 0.28-13.57), as are consolidations (OR 1.44; 95% CI 0.24-8.48) and septal thickening/bronchiectasis (OR 1.47; 95% CI 0.12-17.81). Patients with O2-refractory SRF showed a 6.36-fold higher risk for hypoperfusion on the iodine map. CONCLUSION: By adding the functional image to the anatomical image, pulmonary angiography with MDCT and iodine mapping can demonstrate not only PTE in main, lobar and segmental arteries, but also the presence of hypoperfusion in distal vessels. This makes it a highly useful tool for the accurate diagnosis and therapeutic orientation of patients with Covid-19 lung involvement.","Pérez Dueñas, Virginia; Allona Krauel, María; Agrela Rojas, Emilio; Ramírez Prieto, Maria Teresa; Díez Izquierdo, Laura; López de la Guardia, Ulpiano; Torres Sánchez, Isabel",Arch. bronconeumol.

METHODS: A 58-question, web-based survey was administered to orthopaedic residents in South Korea. A total of 229 orthopaedic residents from 43 hospitals completed the survey questionnaire. RESULTS: The average working time of 72.7 hours/week before the pandemic was decreased to 65.6 hours/week during the pandemic (p < 0.001). The time working in the operating room was significantly decreased during the pandemic, but not in the emergency centre and outpatient clinic. The education times for lecture and clinical case discussion were decreased during the pandemic (both, p < 0.001), respectively. While the use of traditional teaching methods was decreased, the use of online-based teaching methods was increased (p < 0.001). However, satisfaction level with online-based teaching methods was significantly lower compared with that of traditional teaching methods. The average working time exposed to the patients with COVID-19 was 9.7 hours/week. About 47.6% of orthopaedic residents experienced isolation or quarantine. The average score for quality of life, which was 68.9 out of 100 scores before the pandemic, decreased to 61.7 during the pandemic (p < 0.001). The most stressful factor for orthopaedic residents during the pandemic was family/relative health, followed by their own health and residency program.

The objective of this work was to detect if the care strategy ""Voluntary early discharge and home visit by the midwife (2nd year EIR)"" applied by the HULP during the COVID-19 pandemic had any adverse effect on the woman and/or the newborn. METHODS: Cross-sectional observational descriptive study using convenience sampling among women included in the early discharge-home visit program from March 24th to May 5th 2020. 222 medical records and telephone surveys to postpartum women who complied with the inclusion criteria were analyzed. The statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.4. RESULTS: The average of inpatient time was 25 hours and 15 minutes. 8.6% of newborns were sent back to the HULP, and 2.2% were readmitted for hyperbilirubinemia. 2.3% of parents took their infants to the Emergency Care Unit, but only 0.46% needed readmission. 0.4% of postpartum women were readmitted. At the discharge, 84.2% of newborns exclusively breastfed.

However, many factors have been shown to be particularly associated with COVID-19 mortality including demographic characteristics, behavior, comorbidities, and social conditions. Kidney transplant candidates may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 as many are dialysis-dependent and have comorbid conditions. We examined factors associated with COVID-19 mortality among kidney transplant candidates from the National Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients from March 1 to December 1, 2020. We evaluated crude rates and multivariable incident rate ratios (IRR) of COVID-19 mortality. There were 131 659 candidates during the study period with 3534 all-cause deaths and 384 denoted a COVID-19 cause (5.00/1000 person years).

Followed up for 28 days. Among these, bevacizumab plus standard care markedly improves the PaO2/FiO2 ratios at days 1 and 7. By day 28, 24 (92%) patients show improvement in oxygen-support status, 17 (65%) patients are discharged, and none show worsen oxygen-support status nor die. Significant reduction of lesion areas/ratios are shown in chest computed tomography (CT) or X-ray within 7 days. Of 14 patients with fever, body temperature normalizes within 72 h in 13 (93%) patients. Relative to comparable controls, bevacizumab shows clinical efficacy by improving oxygenation and shortening oxygen-support duration.

We acquire stereo images using a mobile camera to enable a three-dimensional (3D) analysis of the skin surface. However, geometric changes in the observed skin structure caused by the lens distortion of the mobile phone result in a low accuracy of the 3D information extracted through stereo matching. Therefore, our study proposes a Distortion Correction Matrix (DCM) to correct the fine distortion of close-up mobile images, pixel by pixel. We verified the correction performance by analyzing the results of correspondence point matching in the stereo image corrected using the DCM. We also confirmed the correction results of the image taken at the five different working distances and derived a linear regression model for the relationship between the angle of the image and the distortion ratio. The proposed DCM considers the distortion degree, which appears to be different in the left and right regions of the image. Finally, we performed a fine distortion correction, which is difficult to check with the naked eye. The results of this study can enable the accurate and precise 3D analysis of the skin surface using corrected mobile images.","Moon, Cho-I; Lee, Onseok",,255,16

However, these tests can occasionally produce discrepant results, causing confusion in their interpretation. Here, we evaluated the performance and features of three diagnostic assays: quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) v2.1, and the LUMIPULSE antigen test. Twenty-seven serial nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from a prolonged viral shedding patient who had been hospitalized for 51 days. We examined the SARS-CoV-2 detection rates of the three tests. The overall agreement rate was 81% between RT-qPCR and FilmArray RP v2.1, 63% between the antigen test and FilmArray RP v2.1, and 59% between the antigen test and RT-qPCR. We obtained concordant results in samples with high viral loads (low threshold cycle values) by all three tests. RT-qPCR and FilmArray RP v2.1 accurately detected SARS-CoV-2 at the early to intermediate phases of infection, but the results varied at the late phase. The antigen test also produced a positive result at the early phase but varied at the intermediate phase and consistently produced negative results at late phase of infection. These results demonstrated FilmArray RP v2.1 could detect SARS-CoV-2 with accuracy comparable to RT-qPCR. Further, there were discrepant results using different types of diagnostic tests during the clinical course of prolonged viral shedding patient.

However, its efficacy has not been compared with that of chemotherapy in a phase III trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: PEARL is a multicentre, phase III randomised study in which patients with aromatase inhibitors (AIs)-resistant MBC were included in two consecutive cohorts. In cohort 1 (C1), patients were randomised 1:1 to palbociclib plus exemestane or capecitabine. On discovering new evidence about oestrogen receptor-1 (ESR1) mutations inducing resistance to AIs, the trial was amended to include cohort 2 (C2), in which patients were randomised 1:1 between palbociclib plus fulvestrant and capecitabine. The stratification criteria were disease site, prior sensitivity to ET, prior chemotherapy for MBC, and country of origin. Co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) in C2 and in wild-type ESR1 patients (C1+C2). ESR1 hotspot mutations were analysed in baseline circulating tumour DNA. RESULTS: From March-2014 to July-2018, 296 and 305 patients were included in C1 and C2, respectively. Palbociclib plus ET was not superior to capecitabine in both C2 (median PFS: 7.5 vs. 10.0 months; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.13; 95% confidence Interval [CI]: 0.85-1.50) and wild-type ESR1 patients (median PFS: 8.0 vs. 10.6 months; aHR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.87-1.41). The most frequent grade 3-4 toxicities with palbociclib plus exemestane, palbociclib plus fulvestrant, and capecitabine were neutropenia (57.4%, 55.7% and 5.5%), hand/foot syndrome (0%, 0% and 23.5%), and diarrhoea (1.3%, 1.3% and 7.6%). Palbociclib plus ET offered better quality of life (aHR for time to deterioration of global health status: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.53-0.85).

These sentiment-aware intelligent systems are driven by language models which broadly fall into two paradigms: 1. Lexicon-based and 2. Contextual. Although recent contextual models are increasingly dominant, we still see demand for lexicon-based models because of their interpretability and ease of use. For example, lexicon-based models allow researchers to readily determine which words and phrases contribute most to a change in measured sentiment. A challenge for any lexicon-based approach is that the lexicon needs to be routinely expanded with new words and expressions. Crowdsourcing annotations for semantic dictionaries may be an expensive and time-consuming task. Here, we propose two models for predicting sentiment scores to augment semantic lexicons at a relatively low cost using word embeddings and transfer learning. Our first model establishes a baseline employing a simple and shallow neural network initialized with pre-trained word embeddings using a non-contextual approach. Our second model improves upon our baseline, featuring a deep Transformer-based network that brings to bear word definitions to estimate their lexical polarity. Our evaluation shows that both models are able to score new words with a similar accuracy to reviewers from Amazon Mechanical Turk, but at a fraction of the cost.","Alshaabi, Thayer; Oort, Colin Van; Fudolig, Mikaela; Arnold, Michael V.; Danforth, Christopher M.; Dodds, Peter Sheridan",,255,26

Methacholine (MCH) acts by inducing airway tightening/bronchoconstriction, and more importantly, MCH is hydrolyzed by cholinesterase enzyme (ChE). Recently, the American Thoracic Society raised concerns about pulmonary function testing during the COVID-19 pandemic due to recently reported correlation between cholinesterase and COVID-19 pneumonia severity/mortality, and it was shown that cholinesterase levels are reduced in the acute phase of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This work describes the microfabrication of potentiometric sensors using copper as the substrate and chemically polymerized graphene nanocomposites as the transducing layer for tracking the kinetics of MCH enzymatic degradation in real blood samples. The in-vitro estimation of the characteristic parameters of the MCH metabolism [Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and reaction velocity (Vmax)] were found to be 241.041 µM and 56.8 µM/min, respectively. The proposed sensor is designed to be used as a companion diagnostic device that can (i) answer questions about patient eligibility to perform methacholine challenge tests, (ii) individualize/personalize medical dosing of methacholine, (iii) provide portable and inexpensive devices allowing automated readouts without the need for operator intervention (iv) recommend therapeutic interventions including intensive care during early stages and reflecting the disease state of COVID-19 pneumonia. We hope that this methacholine electrochemical sensor will help in assaying ChE activity in a ""timely"" manner and predict the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 to improve treatment outcomes and decrease mortality.","ElDin, Norhan Badr; El-Rahman, Mohamed K Abd; Zaazaa, Hala E; Moustafa, Azza A; Hassan, Said A",Biosens Bioelectron,255,29

The purpose of this study was to analyze the characteristics of otorhinolaryngological findings in order to improve COVID-19 diagnostic systems in a primary care setting. METHODS: A total of 351 patients (mean age, 36.0 ± 15.4 years) diagnosed with COVID-19 by otolaryngologists who belong to the Japan Otorhinolaryngologists Association were included in the study. A web-based questionnaire was used to collect information regarding the timing of positive identification of COVID-19, the route of infection, symptoms, and findings in the tonsils, nasal cavity, pharynx, ear, and neck. A modified Centor score was calculated for cases in which age, symptoms, and tonsil and neck findings were described. RESULTS: Symptoms included fever (56%), olfactory disturbance (46%), and a sore throat (56%). Of the individuals considered, 63% had ordinary rhinoscopic findings, 21% experienced watery rhinorrhea, and 12% had observable mucosal redness. Further, 87% had ordinary tonsillar findings, 13% displayed tonsillar redness, with enlargement and white mucus observe in 2% and 1% of participants, respectively. A total of 193 patients had a calculated Centor score of 3 points in 2%, and scores of the remaining participants were &#8804;2 points. CONCLUSION: Of all patients considered, 40% had nasal findings and 4% had purulent nasal discharge. In contrast, only 13% of the patients had tonsillar findings, and no patients had Centor scores &#8805;4 points. Symptom differentiation from that of bacterial infections is difficult. In areas where COVID-19 is prevalent, the disease should be considered in patients presenting with fever, olfactory disturbances, and sore throat with minimal or no clinical findings in the nasal cavity and pharynx.","Kimura, Yurika; Nogami, Kenichiro; Watanabe, Kazuo; Yoshimura, Tadashi; Asai, Hideyo; Fujioka, Osamu; Kawasaki, Yoshiaki; Igarashi, Mitsuru; Inamura, Naoki; Kawashima, Kayoko; Nishino, Hiroshi; Fukuyo, Kazumasa",Auris Nasus Larynx,255,29

Segmentation is so far the most widely investigated medical image processing task, but the various segmentation challenges have typically been organized in isolation, such that algorithm development was driven by the need to tackle a single specific clinical problem. We hypothesized that a method capable of performing well on multiple tasks will generalize well to a previously unseen task and potentially outperform a custom-designed solution. To investigate the hypothesis, we organized the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) - a biomedical image analysis challenge, in which algorithms compete in a multitude of both tasks and modalities. The underlying data set was designed to explore the axis of difficulties typically encountered when dealing with medical images, such as small data sets, unbalanced labels, multi-site data and small objects. The MSD challenge confirmed that algorithms with a consistent good performance on a set of tasks preserved their good average performance on a different set of previously unseen tasks. Moreover, by monitoring the MSD winner for two years, we found that this algorithm continued generalizing well to a wide range of other clinical problems, further confirming our hypothesis. Three main conclusions can be drawn from this study: (1) state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms are mature, accurate, and generalize well when retrained on unseen tasks; (2) consistent algorithmic performance across multiple tasks is a strong surrogate of algorithmic generalizability; (3) the training of accurate AI segmentation models is now commoditized to non AI experts.","Antonelli, Michela; Reinke, Annika; Bakas, Spyridon; Farahani, Keyvan; AnnetteKopp-Schneider,; Landman, Bennett A.; Litjens, Geert; Menze, Bjoern; Ronneberger, Olaf; M.Summers, Ronald; Ginneken, Bram van; Bilello, Michel; Bilic, Patrick; Christ, Patrick F.; Do, Richard K.

Regardless, the non-negligible share of health-care spending is still considered wasteful, and the search for efficiency gains in healthcare is still relevant. The relevance even increases in the context of events related to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease in 2020, presenting new challenges for performance management in hospitals. Considering the gaps between the environmental settings of various countries, a finding of one universal theory of effective hospital management is unlikely. The contextual examination of hospital management on the national level and knowledge-sharing is then a more suitable approach to aid the practitioners in search of the most appropriate mix of management practices.This study employed a mixed methodological approach to examine individual aspects of performance management from the hospital management’s perspective to identify the areas of potential efficiency gains. The core research phase consisted of on-site visits in three public hospitals taking place since September 2019 with the respondents from various management levels and both clinicians and non-clinicians. During an approximately hour-long session the respondents were asked to fill out the questionnaire examining the aspects of the performance management system employed in their institution (e.g., the scope of measurement, reliability of data, communication of results, engagement of management) and interviewed to examine the rationale of provided responses. The on-site research stage resulted in 87 complete data sets further analyzed using statistical analysis with results interpreted using commentaries and rationales obtained from interviews.The findings were similar among all examined institutions and mostly consistent with similarly natured studies. While the performance measurement appeared to reflect the clinical performance better than the organizational one, it is also perceived as inadequate to the complexity of service. The management seemed to consider performance management for operational purposes rather than being incentive-oriented or exploratory, in line with the perceived lack of connection between the performance measurement and the organizational strategy. Combined with poor communication of performance management principles, this discrepancy appears to contribute to the potential tension between the hospital and clinical management in setting priorities between the economic performance and the quality of care. Overall, these findings should provide insight into aspects influencing performance management employed in public hospitals in the Czech Republic and present the evidence for the discussion of potential efficiency gains in practice.","Krupička, Josef",Network of Institutes and Schools of Public Administration in Central and Eastern Europe.

Many estimation methods require linking cases by direct transmission, a difficult task for most diseases. METHODS: Using a subset of cases with detailed genetic and/or contact investigation data to develop a training set of probable transmission events, we build a model to estimate the relative transmission probability for all case-pairs from demographic, spatial and clinical data. Our method is based on naive Bayes, a machine learning classification algorithm which uses the observed frequencies in the training dataset to estimate the probability that a pair is linked given a set of covariates. RESULTS: In simulations, we find that the probabilities estimated using genetic distance between cases to define training transmission events are able to distinguish between truly linked and unlinked pairs with high accuracy (area under the receiver operating curve value of 95%). Additionally, only a subset of the cases, 10-50% depending on sample size, need to have detailed genetic data for our method to perform well. We show how these probabilities can be used to estimate the average effective reproductive number and apply our method to a tuberculosis outbreak in Hamburg, Germany. CONCLUSIONS: Our method is a novel way to infer transmission dynamics in any dataset when only a subset of cases has rich contact investigation and/or genetic data.","Leavitt, Sarah V; Lee, Robyn S; Sebastiani, Paola; Horsburgh, C Robert; Jenkins, Helen E; White, Laura F",Int J Epidemiol,255,29

Secondary aims were to determine: 1) the frequency of neurological complaints during the hospital stay; 2) whether the presence of any neurological complaint at presentation or any of the individual types of neurological complaints at admission predicted three separate outcomes: death, length of hospital stay, or the need for intubation; and 3) if the presence of any neurological complaint or any of the individual types of neurological complaints developed during hospital stay predicted the previous three outcomes. Setting: The Louisiana Health Sciences Center - New Orleans Institutional Review Board and the University Medical Center Clinical Research Review Committee approved the study protocol. Data acquisition: We reviewed the electronic medical records (EMR) of patients hospitalized during March (March 1st through March 31st) 2020 at the University Medical Center New Orleans (UMCNO), who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the same hospitalization. The EMR team generated a list of 257 patients admitted for COVID-19. We excluded seven patients because of a negative COVID-19 test result or incomplete medical record documentation. Three neurology residents (DC, MS, DB) reviewed the EMR in detail to capture the relevant medical history, clinical course, and laboratory test results and abstracted data into an electronic data collection spreadsheet.We recorded the presentation or development of the following neurological complaints: headache, syncope, altered mental status, seizure, status epilepticus, and ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Statistical analysis: We used ""R"" (statistics software) and Microsoft Excel to generate summary tables. To analyse hospital length of stay or death, we fitted a competing risks proportional hazards model for time to discharge or death using the crr() function in R version 4.0.0. The competing risks model allowed the analysis of hospital stay, taking into account that the censoring of cases due to death was not random. To predict the likelihood of intubation, we used the glm() function in R to fit a logistic regression model.

The comparison between the two groups found that, patients with elder age, underlying diseases, more lung lesions and low protein contents, were more likely to develop lung infections. At last, univariate analysis showed that 6 factors, including indwelling gastric catheter, the number of deep vein catheters, tracheal intubation tracheotomy, invasive mechanical ventilation, hormonal application, and the use of more than three antibacterial drugs, are risk factors for COVID-19 secondary pulmonary infection. Generalized linear models and logistic regression analysis showed antimicrobial use as an independent risk factor for COVID-19 secondary lung infection. There are many risk factors for secondary lung infection in severe COVID-19 patients, and it is recommended to use antibiotics reasonably.","Tang, Haicheng; Zhao, Zhangyan; Zhang, Xiaolin; Pan, Lei; Wu, Qingguo; Wang, Mei; Zhang, Yunbin; Li, Feng",Microb Pathog,255,26

METHODS: Seventy-six patients with suspected COVID-19 in fever isolation wards of Second Hospital of Lanzhou University were enrolled From January 31, 2020 to February 22, 2020. Their clinical baseline data were collected. The anxiety of patients was assessed by Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and the depression of patients was assessed by Hamilton Depression Scale. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors of anxiety and depression in these patients. RESULTS: Female patients are more likely to have anxiety (OR=3.206, 95%CI: 1.073-9.583, P<0.05) and depression (OR=9.111, 95%CI: 2.143-38.729, P<0.01) than male patients; patients with known contact history of epidemic area and personnel in epidemic area are more likely to have depression (OR=3.267, 95%CI: 1.082-9.597, P<0.05).

This study evaluated anxiety symptom severity and associations with appetitive traits in students at a large public University in the U.S. during the pandemic. METHODS: Current undergraduate and graduate/professional students completed a cross-sectional survey in fall 2020. Demographic information, anxiety symptoms in the past 2 weeks assessed by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and appetitive traits assessed by the Adult Eating Behavior Questionnaire (AEBQ) were evaluated. Mean scores for eight AEBQ scales (four food approach and four food avoidance traits) were calculated. Differences in mean scores were examined between participants with moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 score &#8805; 10) and those with mild to no anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 score < 10) via independent samples t-tests and effect sizes. Associations between GAD-7 score and individual appetitive traits were also examined, adjusting for age and gender. RESULTS: Of the 1243 students who completed the survey (57% undergraduates; mean age = 26.5 years), 51.9% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. Groups experiencing the highest degree of moderate to severe anxiety symptoms included transgender, gender fluid, and other-gendered participants (73.6%); the youngest age group [18-20 years (62%)]; undergraduate students (60.7%); and Hispanic/Latinx participants (57.7%). Participants with moderate to severe anxiety symptoms had higher scores for most food approach and avoidance traits but lower scores for enjoyment of food than those with mild to no anxiety symptoms. Effect sizes were largest for hunger and emotional over-eating (Cohen's d = 0.31 and 0.30, respectively). Adjusting for age and gender, GAD-7 score was significantly and positively associated with hunger, emotional over-eating, food and satiety responsiveness, and food fussiness and negatively associated with enjoyment of food. CONCLUSIONS: Over half of students at a U.S. University reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms during COVID-19. More severe anxiety symptoms were associated with increased hunger, emotional over-eating, and food and satiety responsiveness and decreased enjoyment of food. Universities must consider strategies to address anxiety, particularly in younger students; transgender, gender fluid, and students of other genders; and across race/ethnicities keeping in mind associations with appetitive traits.","Coakley, Kathryn E; Le, Huyen; Silva, Spirit Rae; Wilks, Aspen",Nutr J,255,21

METHODS: 1. Tblastx searches of SARS-CoV-2 are performed by limiting searches to five Plasmodium species that infect humans. 2. Aligned sequences in the respective organisms' proteomes are searched with blastp. 3. Binding predictions of the identified SARS-CoV-2 peptide to HLA supertype representatives are performed. 4. Blastp searches of predicted epitopes that bind strongly to the identified HLA allele are performed by limiting searches to H. sapiens and Plasmodium species, separately. 5. Peptides with minimum 60% identity to the predicted epitopes are found in results. 6. Peptides among those, which bind strongly to the same HLA allele, are predicted. 7. Step-4 is repeated by limiting searches to H. sapiens, followed by the remaining steps until step-7, for peptides sourced by Plasmodium species after step-6. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 peptide with single letter amino acid code CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC has the highest identity to P. vivax. Its YFCTCYFGLF part is predicted to bind strongly to HLA-A*24:02. Peptides in the human proteome both homologous to YFCTCYFGLF and with a strong binding affinity to HLA-A*24:02 are YYCARRFGLF, YYCHCPFGVF, and YYCQQYFFLF. Such peptides in the Plasmodium species' proteomes are FFYTFYFELF, YFVACLFILF, and YFPTITFHLF. The first one belonging to P. falciparum has a homologous peptide (YFYLFSLELF) in the human proteome, which also has a strong binding affinity to the same HLA allele. CONCLUSION: Immune responses to the identified-peptides with similar sequences and strong binding affinities to HLA-A*24:02 can be related to autoimmune response risk in individuals with HLA-A*24:02 serotypes, upon getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 or P. falciparum.","Adiguzel, Yekbun",Acta Trop,255,21

Though SARS-CoV-2 is known as a respiratory virus, its detection in faecal matter and wastewater demonstrates its enteric involvement resulting in vulnerable aquatic environment. Here, we provide the latest updates on wastewater-based epidemiology, which is gaining interest in the current situation as a unique tool of surveillance and monitoring of the disease. Transport pathways with its migration through wastewater to surface and subsurface waters, probability of infectivity and ways of inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 are discussed in detail. Epidemiological models, especially compartmental projections, have been explained with an emphasis on its limitation and the assumptions on which the future predictions of disease propagation are based. Besides, this review covers various predictive models to track and project disease spread in the future and gives an insight into the probability of a future outbreak of the disease.","Kumar, Manish; Mohapatra, Sanjeeb; Mazumder, Payal; Singh, Ashwin; Honda, Ryo; Lin, Chuxia; Kumari, Rina; Goswami, Ritusmita; Jha, Pawan Kumar; Vithanage, Meththika; Kuroda, Keisuke",Curr Pollut Rep,255,19

METHODS: This retrospective telephone survey investigated 196 consecutive patients with COVID-19 at 3 months after discharge from two hospitals in Wuhan, China. The characteristics of the patient's disease course and time to recovery from olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunction (OD and/or GD) were collected by telephone interview. Demographic data were collected from the patient medical records. RESULTS: A total of 196 patients with COVID-19 completed the study. The most prevalent general symptoms were fever, cough, and fatigue. Overall, 19.9% of the patients reported OD and/or GD. In 87.2% of these cases, OD or GD appeared after the general symptoms. The time to recovery from OD and/or GD was more than 4 weeks in 51.4% of the patients. Patients with COVID-19 and OD and/or GD had significantly higher rates of cardiovascular disease than patients without OD and/or GD (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Recovery from chemosensory dysfunction (OD and/or GD) was slow, with over half of the patients taking more than 4 weeks to recover.

Infiltration of inflammatory cells is reported to play critical roles in the pathogenesis of hepatic IRI. Although T lymphocytes, neutrophils and monocytes infiltrated into the liver underwent IRI, we found that neutrophil depletion significantly attenuated the injury and serum liver enzyme levels in a murine model. Interestingly, the expression of CD321/JAM-A/F11R, one of essential molecules for transmigration of circulating leukocytes into inflammatory tissues, was significantly augmented on hepatic sinusoid endothelium at 1 h after ischemia and maintained until 45 min after reperfusion. The intraportal administration of anti-CD321 monoclonal antibody (90G4) significantly inhibited the leukocytes infiltration after reperfusion and diminished the damage responses by hepatic IRI (serum liver enzymes, inflammatory cytokines and hepatocyte cell death). Taken together, presented results demonstrated that blockade of CD321 by 90G4 antibody significantly attenuated hepatic IRI accompanied with substantial inhibition of leukocytes infiltration, particularly inhibition of neutrophil infiltration in the early phase of reperfusion. Thus, our work offers a potent therapeutic target, CD321, for preventing liver IRI.","Yin, Enzhi; Fukuhara, Takeshi; Takeda, Kazuyoshi; Kojima, Yuko; Fukuhara, Kyoko; Ikejima, Kenichi; Bashuda, Hisashi; Kitaura, Jiro; Yagita, Hideo; Okumura, Ko; Uchida, Koichiro",Sci Rep,255,16

Deep-learning artificial intelligent (AI) methods have the potential to help improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy for reading portable CXRs. PURPOSE: The study aimed at developing an AI imaging analysis tool to classify COVID-19 lung infection based on portable CXRs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Public datasets of COVID-19 (N = 130), bacterial pneumonia (N = 145), non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia (N = 145), and normal (N = 138) CXRs were analyzed. Texture and morphological features were extracted. Five supervised machine-learning AI algorithms were used to classify COVID-19 from other conditions. Two-class and multi-class classification were performed. Statistical analysis was done using unpaired two-tailed t tests with unequal variance between groups. Performance of classification models used the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: For the two-class classification, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 100%, 100%, and 100% for COVID-19 vs normal; 96.34%, 95.35% and 97.44% for COVID-19 vs bacterial pneumonia; and 97.56%, 97.44% and 97.67% for COVID-19 vs non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia. For the multi-class classification, the combined accuracy and AUC were 79.52% and 0.87, respectively. CONCLUSION: AI classification of texture and morphological features of portable CXRs accurately distinguishes COVID-19 lung infection in patients in multi-class datasets. Deep-learning methods have the potential to improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy for portable CXRs.","Hussain, Lal; Nguyen, Tony; Li, Haifang; Abbasi, Adeel A; Lone, Kashif J; Zhao, Zirun; Zaib, Mahnoor; Chen, Anne; Duong, Tim Q",Biomed Eng Online,255,3

However, capacity has not always matched this increased demand. As such, passengers experience long waiting times and are denied boarding during the peak hours. Crowded platforms and the subsequent customer dissatisfaction and safety issues have become a serious concern. The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically reduced passengers’ willingness to board crowded trains, causing a surge in demand for real-time crowding information. In this paper, we propose a real-time predictive decision support platform which addresses both, operations control and customer information needs. The system provides crowding predictions on trains and platforms, communicates this information to passengers, and takes into account their response to it. It is demonstrated through a case study that providing predictive information to passengers can potentially reduce denied boarding and lead to better utilization of train capacity.","Noursalehi, Peyman Koutsopoulos Haris N.; Zhao, Jinhua",Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,255,0

Here we present a simple modification of the SIR equations to include the heterogeneity of social connection networks. A typical power-law model of social interactions from network science reproduces the observation that individuals with a high number of contacts, ""hubs"" or ""superspreaders"", can become the primary conduits for transmission. Conversely, once the tail of the distribution is saturated, herd immunity sets in at a smaller overall recovered fraction than in the analogous SIR model. The new dynamical equations suggest that cutting off the tail of the social connection distribution, i.e., stopping superspreaders, is an efficient non-pharmaceutical intervention to slow the spread of a pandemic, such as the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Szapudi, Istvan",Appl Netw Sci,255,32

The Group Method of Data Handling is a novel self organized data mining technique with data driven adaptive learning capability which grasps the auto correlative relations between the samples and gives a high forecasting accuracy irrespective of the length and stochasticity of a time series. The GMDH model has been first validated and standardized by forecasting the number of active and confirmed cases during lockdown III-IV with an accuracy of 2.58% and 2.00% respectively. Thereafter, the number of active cases has been forecasted for the rest of 2020 to predict the impact of lockdown relaxation on spread of COVID-19 and indicate preparatory measures necessary to counter it.","Vaishnav, Vaibhav; Vajpai, Jayashri",Chaos Solitons Fractals,255,30

It has been reported also in patients with COVID-19, Hodgkin disease and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We analyzed the clinical relevance of Low T3 syndrome in COVID-19 patients and, in particular, in those with associated hematological malignancies. METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive patients, hospitalized during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Sant'Andrea University Hospital in Rome, were subdivided in 38 patients (Group A), showing low levels of FT3, and in 24 patients (Group B), with normal FT3 serum values. During the acute phase of the disease, we measured serum, radiologic and clinical disease severity markers and scores, in search of possible correlations with FT3 serum values. In addition, in 6 COVID-19 patients, 4 with Low T3 syndrome, including 2 with a hematological malignancy, and 2 with normal FT3 values, we performed, high-dimensional single-cell analysis by mass cytometry, multiplex cytokine assay and gene expression profiling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). RESULTS: Low FT3 serum values were correlated with increased Absolute Neutrophil Count, NLR and dNLR ratios and with reduced total count of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Low FT3 values correlated also with increased levels of inflammation, tissue damage and coagulation serum markers as well as with SOFA, LIPI and TSS scores. The CyTOF analysis demonstrated reduction of the effector memory and terminal effector subtypes of the CD4+ T lymphocytes. Multiplex cytokine assay indicates that mainly IL-6, IP-10 and MCAF changes are associated with FT3 serum levels, particularly in patients with coexistent hematological malignancies. Gene expression analysis using Nanostring identified four genes differently expressed involved in host immune response, namely CD38, CD79B, IFIT3 and NLRP3.

In a multicenter, international study, we investigated if overweight, obesity, and diabetes were independently associated with COVID-19 severity and whether the BMI-associated risk was increased among those with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively extracted data from health care records and regional databases of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 from 18 sites in 11 countries. We used standardized definitions and analyses to generate site-specific estimates, modeling the odds of each outcome (supplemental oxygen/noninvasive ventilatory support, invasive mechanical ventilatory support, and in-hospital mortality) by BMI category (reference, overweight, obese), adjusting for age, sex, and prespecified comorbidities. Subgroup analysis was performed on patients with preexisting diabetes. Site-specific estimates were combined in a meta-analysis. RESULTS: Among 7,244 patients (65.6% overweight/obese), those with overweight were more likely to require oxygen/noninvasive ventilatory support (random effects adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.44; 95% CI 1.15-1.80) and invasive mechanical ventilatory support (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI 1.03-1.46). There was no association between overweight and in-hospital mortality (aOR, 0.88; 95% CI 0.74-1.04). Similar effects were observed in patients with obesity or diabetes. In the subgroup analysis, the aOR for any outcome was not additionally increased in those with diabetes and overweight or obesity. CONCLUSIONS: In adults hospitalized with COVID-19, overweight, obesity, and diabetes were associated with increased odds of requiring respiratory support but were not associated with death. In patients with diabetes, the odds of severe COVID-19 were not increased above the BMI-associated risk.","Longmore, Danielle K; Miller, Jessica E; Bekkering, Siroon; Saner, Christoph; Mifsud, Edin; Zhu, Yanshan; Saffery, Richard; Nichol, Alistair; Colditz, Graham; Short, Kirsty R; Burgner, David P",Diabetes care,255,16

Methods: Epidemiological, business and economic data were extracted from official government sources covering the period 31st January to 13th August 2020; healthcare system data up to end of June 2019. Results: UK-wide COVID-19 cases and deaths were 313,798 and 46,706 respectively (472 cases and 70 deaths per 100,000 population) by 12th August. There were regional variations in England, with London and North West (756 and 666 cases per 100,000 population respectively) disproportionately affected compared with other regions. As of 11th August, 13,618,470 tests had been conducted in the UK. Increased risk of mortality was associated with age (&#8805;60 years), gender (male) and BAME groups. Since onset of the pandemic, emergency department attendance, primary care utilisation and cancer referrals and inpatient/outpatient referrals have declined; emergency ambulance and NHS111 calls increased. Business sectors most impacted are the arts, entertainment and recreation, followed by accommodation and food services. Government interventions aimed at curtailing the business and economic impact have been implemented, but applications for state benefits have increased. Conclusions: The impact of COVID-19 on the UK population, health system and economy has been profound. More data are needed to implement the optimal policy and technological responses to preventing further spikes in COVID-19 cases, and to inform strategic planning to manage future pandemics.","Flynn, Darren; Moloney, Eoin; Bhattarai, Nawaraj; Scott, Jason; Breckons, Matthew; Avery, Leah; Moy, Naomi",,255,32

At present, there is a lack of study to systematically analyze the features of hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (α‐HBDH) in COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: Electronic medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, α‐HBDH results and outcomes of all included patients were extracted. RESULTS: α‐HBDH in COVID‐19 group was higher than that in excluded group (p < 0.001), and there was no significant difference in α‐HBDH before and after the exclusion of 5 patients with comorbidity in heart or kidney (p = 0.671). In COVID‐19 group, the α‐HBDH value in ≥61 years old group, severe group, and critical group, death group all increased at first and then decreased, while no obvious changes were observed in other groups. And there were significant differences of the α‐HBDH value among different age groups (p < 0.001), clinical type groups (p < 0.001), and outcome groups (p < 0.001). The optimal scale regression model showed that α‐HBDH value (p < 0.001) and age (p < 0.001) were related to clinical type. CONCLUSIONS: α‐HBDH was increased in COVID‐19 patients, obviously in ≥61 years old, death and critical group, indicating that patients in these three groups suffer from more serious heart and kidney and other tissues and organs damage, higher α‐HBDH value, and risk of death. The difference between death and survival group in early stage might provide a approach to judge the prognosis. The accuracy of the model to distinguish severe/critical type and other types was 85.84%, suggesting that α‐HBDH could judge the clinical type accurately.","Zhu, Haoming; Qu, Gaojing; Yu, Hui; Huang, Guoxin; Chen, Lei; Zhang, Meiling; Wan, Shanshan; Pei, Bin",J Clin Lab Anal,255,20

To address the current gap in knowledge about post‐acute needs of those infected by COVID‐19, we examined discharge function data to better prepare patients, providers, and health systems to return patients to optimal levels of functioning. OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of functional decline and related rehabilitation needs at hospital discharge. DESIGN: Prospective chart review. SETTING: Academic tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized adults with a laboratory confirmed COVID‐19 diagnosis, with admission dates between March 4, 2020 and May 1, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Discharge location; need for outpatient physical, occupational, or speech therapy; need for durable medical equipment at discharge; presence of dysphagia at discharge; functional decline. RESULTS: Three hundred eleven potential cases were reviewed. The final number of cases included in analysis was N = 288; patient ages ranged from 20 to 95 years old (mean 66.80 ± 15.31 years). Nearly 20 % of COVID‐19 survivors were discharged to a location other than their home. Forty‐five percent of survivors experienced functional decline impacting their discharge. Eighty‐seven survivors (80.6%) who showed functional change during hospitalization were referred for additional therapy at discharge. At least 73 (67.6%) of these patients required durable medical equipment at discharge (in 12 cases this was not clearly documented). Twenty‐nine (26.7%) of the survivors who showed functional changes had ongoing dysphagia at the time of hospital discharge. Ninety‐seven of the survivors (40.6%) were never assessed by a PM&R physician, physical therapist, occupational therapist, or speech language pathologist during their hospitalization.

We analyzed genetic and clinical data from 97 patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Through targeted next-generation-sequencing we found an ADAMTS13 variant in 49 patients, along with two risk factor variants (C3, 21 patients; CFH,34 patients). 31 (32%) patients had a combination of these, which was independently associated with ICU hospitalization (p = 0.022). Analysis of almost infinite variant combinations showed that patients with rs1042580 in thrombomodulin and without rs800292 in complement factor H did not require ICU hospitalization.

Previously the functional role of this extra domain has been completely unknown, and it was believed that the coronavirus 3CL proteases share the same enzymatic mechanism with picornavirus 3C proteases, which contain the chymotrypsin fold but have no extra domain. To understand the functional role of the extra domain and to characterize the enzyme-substrate interactions by use of the dynamic light scattering, circular dichroism, and NMR spectroscopy, we 1) dissected the full-length SARS 3CL protease into two distinct folds and subsequently investigated their structural and dimerization properties and 2) studied the structural and binding interactions of three substrate peptides with the entire enzyme and its two dissected folds. The results lead to several findings; 1) although two dissected parts folded into the native-like structures, the chymotrypsin fold only had weak activity as compared with the entire enzyme, and 2) although the chymotrypsin fold remained a monomer within a wide range of protein concentrations, the extra domain existed as a stable dimer even at a very low concentration. This observation strongly indicates that the extra domain contributes to the dimerization of the SARS 3CL protease, thus, switching the enzyme from the inactive form (monomer) to the active form (dimer). This discovery not only separates the coronavirus 3CL protease from the picornavirus 3C protease in terms of the enzymatic mechanism but also defines the dimerization interface on the extra helical domain as a new target for design of the specific protease inhibitors. Furthermore, the determination of the preferred solution conformation of the substrate peptide S1 together with the NMR differential line-broadening and transferred nuclear Overhauser enhancement study allows us to pinpoint the bound structure of the S1 peptide.","Shi, Jiahai; Wei, Zheng; Song, Jianxing",J Biol Chem,255,6

METHODS: The present work has been designed as a cross-sectional single-centre study to compare characteristics of patients with lung involvement either from MAS or severe COVID-19. Chest CT scans were assessed by using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based software. RESULTS: Ten patients with MAS and 47 patients with severe COVID-19 with lung involvement were assessed. Although all patients showed fever and dyspnoea, patients with MAS were characterised by thrombocytopaenia, whereas patients with severe COVID-19 were characterised by lymphopaenia and neutrophilia. Higher values of H-score characterised patients with MAS when compared with severe COVID-19. AI-reconstructed images of chest CT scan showed that apical, basal, peripheral and bilateral distributions of ground-glass opacities (GGOs), as well as apical consolidations, were more represented in severe COVID-19 than in MAS. C reactive protein directly correlated with GGOs extension in both diseases. Furthermore, lymphopaenia inversely correlated with GGOs extension in severe COVID-19.

The current study examined how living alone was associated with daily social contact and emotional well-being among older adults during the pandemic. METHOD: Adults (N = 226) aged 69+ completed a brief survey assessing their living situation, social contact with different social partners (in person, by phone, electronically), and emotions during the morning, afternoon and evening the prior day. RESULTS: Older adults who live alone were less likely to see others in person or to receive or provide help. Living alone was associated with more positive emotions concurrent with in-person contact. In contrast, phone contact was associated with higher levels of negative affect among those living alone, but not among those who live with others. Older adults who live alone were more likely to have contact with friends (rather than family). DISCUSSION: Findings suggest older adults who live alone may be more reactive to social contact during the COVID-19 outbreak than older adults who reside with others. In-person contact may confer distinct benefits not available via telephone contact, suggesting that possible interventions during the pandemic may work best with safe forms of in-person contact, possibly with non-family members.","Fingerman, Karen L; Ng, Yee To; Zhang, Shiyang; Britt, Katherine; Colera, Gianna; Birditt, Kira S; Charles, Susan T",J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci,255,15

SETTING: A total of 26 dermatology and sexually transmitted disease (STD) departments, 34 obstetrics-gynaecology clinics and 28 urology outpatient clinics selected from 34 hospitals of Shenzhen regarded as our study sites. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2754 participants were recruited in this study, and 2534 participants completed the questionnaire survey and provided genital tract secretion specimens. There were 1106 male and 1428 female participants. Eligible participants were patients who presented for outpatient STD care at the selected clinics for the first time in October 2012 were at least 18 years old, and were able to give informed consent. OUTCOME MEASURES: Untested rate, true-positive rate, false-negative rate and unreported rate of gonorrhoea, as well as reported gonorrhoea incidence sex ratio and true diagnosis sex ratio were calculated and used to describe the results. RESULTS: 2534 participants were enrolled in the study. The untested rate of gonorrhoea among females was significantly higher than that among males (female 88.1%, male 68.3%, p=0.001). The male-to-female sex ratios of untested rate, true-positive rate, false-negative rate and unreported rate were 1:1.3, 1.2:1, 1:1.6 and 1:1.4, respectively. The reported gonorrhoea incidence sex ratio of new diagnosed gonorrhoea was 19.8:1 (male vs female: 87/1106 vs 5/1420), while the true diagnosis sex ratio was 2.5:1 (male vs female: 161/1106 vs 84/1420). These data indicate that the sex ratio of reported gonorrhoea incidence has been overestimated by a factor of 7.9 (19.8/2.5). CONCLUSIONS: We found the current reported gonorrhoea incidence and sex ratios to be inaccurate due to underestimations of gonorrhoea incidence, especially among women.","Xiong, Mingzhou; Lan, Lina; Feng, Tiejian; Zhao, Guanglu; Wang, Feng; Hong, Fuchang; Wu, Xiaobing; Zhang, Chunlai; Wen, Lizhang; Liu, Aizhong; Best, John McCulloch; Tang, Weiming",BMJ Open,255,2

Modern plasma product production technology remains largely based on the ethanol fractionation process, but much has evolved in the last few years to improve product purity, to enhance the recovery of immunoglobulin G, and to isolate new plasma proteins, such as α1-protease inhibitor, von Willebrand factor, and protein C. Because of the human origin of the starting material and the pooling of 10 000 to 50 000 donations required for industrial processing, the major risk associated to plasma products is the transmission of blood-borne infectious agents. A complete set of measures—and, most particularly, the use of dedicated viral inactivation and removal treatments—has been implemented throughout the production chain of fractionated plasma products over the last 20 years to ensure optimal safety, in particular, and not exclusively, against HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus. In this review, we summarize the practices of the modern plasma fractionation industry from the collection of the raw plasma material to the industrial manufacture of fractionated products. We describe the quality requirements of plasma for fractionation and the various treatments applied for the inactivation and removal of blood-borne infectious agents and provide examples of methods used for the purification of the various classes of plasma protein therapies. We also highlight aspects of the good manufacturing practices and the regulatory environment that govern the whole chain of production. In a regulated and professional environment, fractionated plasma products manufactured by modern processes are certainly among the lowest-risk therapeutic biological products in use today.","Burnouf, Thierry",Transfus Med Rev,255,16

Novel therapeutic intervention requires knowledge of intracellular pathways responsible for viral replication, specifically those untargeted by antiretroviral drugs. An understudied phenomenon is the nucleolar localization of Rev phosphoprotein, which completes nucleocytoplasmic transport of unspliced/partially spliced HIV mRNA through multimerization with intronic cis-acting targets—the Rev-response element (RRE). Rev contains a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) comprising the COOH terminus of the arginine-rich motif for accumulation within nucleoli—speculated as the interaction ground for Rev with cellular proteins mediating mRNA-independent nuclear export and splicing. Functionality of Rev nucleolar access during HIV-1 production and infection was investigated in the context of deletion and single-point mutations within Rev-NoLS. Mutations induced upon Rev-NoLS are hypothesized to inactivate the HIV-1 infectious cycle. HIV-1(HXB2) replication ceased with Rev mutations lacking nucleolar access due to loss or replacement of multiple arginine residues. Rev mutations missing single arginine residues remained strictly nucleolar in pattern and participated in proviral production, however, with reduced efficiency. Viral RNA packaging also decreased in efficiency after expression of nucleolar-localizing mutations. These results were observed during propagation of variant HIV-1(NL4-3) containing nucleolar-localizing mutations within the viral backbone (M4, M5, and M6). Lentiviral particles produced with Rev single-point mutations were transducible at extremely low frequency. Similarly, HIV-1(NL4-3) Rev-NoLS variants lost infectivity, unlike virulent WT (wild type) HIV-1(NL4-3). HIV-1(NL4-3) variants were capable of CD4(+) host entry and reverse transcription as WT HIV-1(NL4-3), but lacked ability to complete a full infectious cycle. We currently reveal that viral integration is deregulated in the presence of Rev-NoLS mutations.","Arizala, Jerlisa Ann C.; Takahashi, Mayumi; Burnett, John C.; Ouellet, Dominique L.; Li, Haitang; Rossi, John J.",AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,255,16

Adherence to the 6-monthly dosing schedule of denosumab, the parenteral anti-osteoporosis medication most often used in Singapore, was significantly reduced during the lockdown period compared to that during pre-COVID-19 times. Patients managed by endocrinologists were more likely to be adherent. PURPOSE: No study thus far has quantified actual adherence rates to anti-osteoporosis therapy with denosumab during COVID-19 or explored factors associated with it. We aimed to estimate the adherence rates to denosumab in Singaporean men and women during COVID-19 lockdown and to compare it with those during the pre-COVID-19 period. METHOD: We conducted this retrospective, electronic medical records, and pharmacy claims database study at Singapore General Hospital, the largest hospital in the country. Patients initiated on subcutaneous denosumab between August 2019 and December 2019 and were thus scheduled to receive the second dose during the COVID-19 first-wave period from February 2020 to June 2020 (lockdown group) were analyzed, as were patients initiated anytime on denosumab between September 2011 and December 2018 (pre-COVID-19 group). Data extracted from the hospital’s electronic prescription platform and patients’ pharmacy purchase records were matched. Adherence was defined as being punctual (with an allowable delay of up to 4 weeks) with the second dose scheduled 6 months from the 1st dose. A sensitivity analysis with an allowable delay up to 8 weeks was also performed. We compared the adherence rates between the two periods and explored factors associated with adherence. RESULTS: A total of 768 and 1458 patients respectively during the lockdown and pre-COVID-19 periods were analyzed. The mean adherence rate during lockdown was 63.9%. The odds of being adherent during lockdown were higher if patients were managed by endocrinologists as opposed to those by other specialists [OR 2.516 (95% CI: 1.836–3.448); p < 0.001]. Adherence rates during the pre-COVID-19 period was 75.4%. Overall, the odds of being adherent to denosumab was significantly lower during lockdown than that during the pre-COVID-19 period [OR 0.525 (95% CI 0.430–0.640); p < 0.001], and odds of being adherent were higher if patients were managed by endocrinologists than if they were managed by other specialists (OR 1.765 (95% CI: 1.444–2.158; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Adherence to denosumab was significantly lower during COVID-19 lockdown than the pre-COVID-19 period. The odds of being adherent were higher in patients managed by endocrinologists. Whether healthcare providers from certain specialties spend more time counselling and educating patients about the importance of adherence to osteoporosis medications needs to be explored further.","Chandran, Manju; Hao, Ying; Kwee, Ann Kerwen; Cheen, Mcvin Hua Heng; Chin, Yun Ann; Ng, Valerie Yun Ting",Osteoporos Int,255,20

A Brief Exploratory Survey,16.295956,6.9872084,2020-11-25,"BACKGROUND: Effective management of the spread of a novel infectious disease, such as the COVID-19 virus can be achieved through influencing people’s behavior to adopt preventive measures. The public’s perceptions and attitudes towards the virus, governmental guidance and preventive measures were unknown in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVES: 1) investigate the public perception of COVID-19, anxiety level, the COVID-19 information sources sought, adoption of preventive measures, and ability and willingness to self-isolate during and post-lockdown periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia; 2) investigate socio-demographic factors associated with adoption of preventive measures against COVID-19 and self-isolation practices. METHOD: Between April 22nd and June 21st 2020, Saudi adults aged ≥18 years voluntarily completed a self-administered web-based cross-sectional survey, distributed through social media (WhatsApp) and emails to representatives in education, health, business, and social sectors across all Saudi Arabian regions. The survey included questions on anxiety level, COVID-19 risk perceptions and adoption of preventive measures. Weighted percentages, Pearson’s chi-square tests, and multiple logistic regression were applied to evaluate associations between these factors and socio-demographic variables. RESULTS: A total of 2393 respondents completed the survey. A majority (74%) were worried about the COVID-19 outbreak and of those, 27% reported that it was likely that they would be infected with COVID-19; 16% believed it would be life-threatening or severe. However, only 11% of respondents reported high anxiety level. Adoption of hygiene practices and social distancing were lower among older (> 65 years) compared to younger (18–24 years) respondents (OR: 0.06; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.28 and OR 0.06; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.27 respectively). High percentages of respondents reported being able to (88%) and were willing to (82%) self-isolate. Those with the lowest gross household income and those with at least one flu symptom were less able and willing to self-isolate. A significant increase in levels of anxiety, perceived effectiveness of social distancing and hygiene practices was reported in the post-lockdown compared to during the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The study reported high levels of adoption of preventive measures, willingness and perceived ability to self-isolate during the early phase of the pandemic. Vulnerable groups such as the elderly, and those with low socio-economic status reported lower adoption of preventive measures or ability and willingness to self-isolate. Tailored public health messages and interventions are needed to achieve high adherence to these preventive measures in these groups.

METHODS: The Italian Stroke Organization performed a multicenter study involving 93 Italian Stroke Units. We collected information on hospital admissions for cerebrovascular events from March 1 to March 31, 2020 (study period), and from March 1 to March 31, 2019 (control period). RESULTS: Ischemic strokes decreased from 2399 in 2019 to 1810 in 2020, with a corresponding hospitalization rate ratio (RR) of 0.75 ([95% CI, 0.71–0.80] P<0.001); intracerebral hemorrhages decreased from 400 to 322 (hospitalization RR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.69–0.93]; P=0.004), and transient ischemic attacks decreased from 322 to 196 (hospitalization RR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.51–0.73]; P<0.001). Hospitalizations decreased in Northern, Central, and Southern Italy. Intravenous thrombolyses decreased from 531 (22.1%) in 2019 to 345 in 2020 (19.1%; RR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.75–0.99]; P=0.032), while primary endovascular procedures increased in Northern Italy (RR, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.13–2.32]; P=0.008). We found no correlation (P=0.517) between the hospitalization RRs for all strokes or transient ischemic attack and COVID-19 incidence in the different areas. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalizations for stroke or transient ischemic attacks across Italy were reduced during the worst period of the COVID-19 outbreak. Intravenous thrombolytic treatments also decreased, while endovascular treatments remained unchanged and even increased in the area of maximum expression of the outbreak. Limited hospitalization of the less severe patients and delays in hospital admission, due to overcharge of the emergency system by COVID-19 patients, may explain these data.","Sacco, Simona; Ricci, Stefano; Ornello, Raffaele; Eusebi, Paolo; Petraglia, Luca; Toni, Danilo",Stroke,255,26

Elabela (ELA) serves as a crucial regulator to maintain vascular function and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertensive vascular remodeling. This study aims to explore regulatory roles and underlying mechanisms of ELA in rat aortic adventitial fibroblasts (AFs) in response to angiotensin II (ATII). In cultured AFs, exposure to ATII resulted in marked decreases in mRNA and protein levels of ELA, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as well as increases in apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and cellular migration, which were partially blocked by the exogenous replenishment of ELA and recombinant FGF21, respectively. Moreover, treatment with ELA strikingly reversed ATII-mediated the loss of FGF21 and ACE2 levels in rat aortic AFs. FGF21 knockdown with small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly counterbalanced protective effects of ELA on ATII-mediated the promotion of cell migration, apoptosis, inflammatory, and oxidative injury in rat aortic AFs. More importantly, pretreatment with recombinant FGF21 strikingly inhibited ATII-mediated the loss of ACE2 and the augmentation of cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory injury in rat aortic AFs, which were partially prevented by the knockdown of ACE2 with siRNA. In summary, ELA exerts its anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant effects in rat aortic AFs via activation of the FGF21–ACE2 signaling. ELA may represent a potential candidate to predict vascular damage and targeting the FGF21–ACE2 signaling may be a promising therapeutic intervention for vascular adventitial remodeling and related disorders.","Song, Juan-Juan; Yang, Mei; Liu, Ying; Song, Jia-Wei; Liu, Xiao-Yan; Miao, Ran; Zhang, Zhen-Zhou; Liu, Yu; Fan, Yi-Fan; Zhang, Qian; Dong, Ying; Yang, Xin-Chun; Zhong, Jiu-Chang",J Mol Histol,255,26

Transfer learning using the VGG19 pre-trained convolutional neural network was performed with all voice samples. The performance of the model using the polysyllabic sentence yielded the highest classification performance of all models. The coughing sound produced the lowest classification performance while the ability of the monosyllabic ‘ah’ sound to predict the recent COVID-19 fell between the other two vocalizations. The model using the polysyllabic sentence achieved 85% accuracy, 89% sensitivity, and 77% specificity.

Though ARDS diagnosis is based on clinical criteria, biological markers of acute lung damage have been extensively studied in adults and children. Biomarkers of inflammation, alveolar epithelial and capillary endothelial disruption, disordered coagulation, and associated derangements measured in the circulation and other body fluids, such as bronchoalveolar lavage, have improved our understanding of pathobiology of ARDS. The biochemical signature of ARDS has been increasingly well described in adult populations, and this has led to the identification of molecular phenotypes to augment clinical classifications. However, there is a paucity of data from pediatric ARDS (pARDS) patients. Biomarkers and molecular phenotypes have the potential to identify patients at high risk of poor outcomes, and perhaps inform the development of targeted therapies for specific groups of patients. Additionally, because of the lower incidence of and mortality from ARDS in pediatric patients relative to adults and lack of robust clinical predictors of outcome, there is an ongoing interest in biological markers as surrogate outcome measures. The recent definition of pARDS provides additional impetus for the measurement of established and novel biomarkers in future pediatric studies in order to further characterize this disease process. This chapter will review the currently available literature and discuss potential future directions for investigation into biomarkers in ARDS among children.","Orwoll, Benjamin E.; Sapru, Anil",Front Pediatr,255,1

We explore the psychological, social, and neuroscientific effects of COVID-19 and set out the immediate priorities and longer-term strategies for mental health science research. These priorities were informed by surveys of the public and an expert panel convened by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the mental health research charity, MQ: Transforming Mental Health, in the first weeks of the pandemic in the UK in March, 2020. We urge UK research funding agencies to work with researchers, people with lived experience, and others to establish a high level coordination group to ensure that these research priorities are addressed, and to allow new ones to be identified over time. The need to maintain high-quality research standards is imperative. International collaboration and a global perspective will be beneficial. An immediate priority is collecting high-quality data on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across the whole population and vulnerable groups, and on brain function, cognition, and mental health of patients with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for research to address how mental health consequences for vulnerable groups can be mitigated under pandemic conditions, and on the impact of repeated media consumption and health messaging around COVID-19. Discovery, evaluation, and refinement of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of the pandemic are required. Rising to this challenge will require integration across disciplines and sectors, and should be done together with people with lived experience. New funding will be required to meet these priorities, and it can be efficiently leveraged by the UK's world-leading infrastructure.

They trigger intrinsic, innate and adaptive immune responses, which limit infection. Viruses restore homeostasis by harnessing evolutionary conserved stress responses, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response (UPR(ER)). The canonical UPR(ER) restores homeostasis based on a cell-autonomous signalling network modulating transcriptional and translational output. The UPR(ER) remedies cell damage, but upon severe and chronic stress leads to cell death. Signals from the UPR(ER) flow along three branches with distinct stress sensors, the inositol requiring enzyme (Ire) 1, protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), and the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). This review shows how both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses use the UPR(ER) to control cell stress and metabolic pathways, and thereby enhance infection and progeny formation, or undergo cell death. We highlight how the Ire1 axis bypasses apoptosis, boosts viral transcription and maintains dormant viral genomes during latency and persistence periods concurrent with long term survival of infected cells. These considerations open new options for oncolytic virus therapies against cancer cells where the UPR(ER) is frequently upregulated. We conclude with a discussion of the evolutionary impact that viruses, in particular retroviruses, and anti-viral defense has on the UPR(ER).","Prasad, Vibhu; Greber, Urs F",FEMS Microbiol Rev,255,16

Severely injured patients are often in continuous need of intensive care and ventilator treatment. The question arises, whether restrictions related to COVID-19 have led to a decrease in severely injured patients and thus to an increase in intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all seriously injured patients with an injury severity score (ISS) ≥16 was performed between 17 March and 30 April 2020 at a level 1 trauma center in Germany. The mechanism of injury and the ISS were recorded. Further data were collected as to whether it was a work-related accident, a documented suicide attempt and if surgery was necessary in the first 24 h after arrival in hospital. Data from 2018 and 2019 served as a control group. RESULTS: There was no substantial difference in the total number of seriously injured patients (2018 n = 30, 2019 n = 23, 2020 n = 27). Furthermore, there was no relevant difference in the number of patients needing intensive care or ventilator treatment when leaving the shock room. The number of patients needing an operative intervention within the first 24 h after arriving at hospital was slightly higher in 2020. The mean ISS was at a constant level during all 3 years. In 2020 there was no polytraumatized motorbike rider, who did not have a work-related accident (2018 n = 5, 2019 n = 4, 2020 n = 0). A noticeable increase in work-related accidents was observed (2018: 10%, 2019: 26.1%, 2020 44.4%). DISCUSSION: Restrictions related to COVID-19 did not lead to a reduction in seriously injured patients needing ICU care. Due to the monocentric data analysis there is room for misinterpretation.

Virus and host cell dynamics are tightly connected, generating a complex dynamics that conveys in virion assembly to ensure virus spread in the body. Starting from the knowledge of relevant processes in (+ss)RNA virus replication, transcription, translation, virions budding and shedding, and their respective energy costs, we built up a systems thinking (ST)–based diagram of the virus–host interaction, comprehensive of stocks, flows, and processes as well-described in literature. In ST approach, stocks and flows are expressed by a proxy of the energy embedded and transmitted, respectively, whereas processes are referred to the energy required for the system functioning. In this perspective, healthiness is just a particular configuration, in which stocks relevant for the system (equivalent but not limited to proteins, RNA, DNA, and all metabolites required for the survival) are constant, and the system behavior is stationary. At time of infection, the presence of additional stocks (e.g., viral protein and RNA and all metabolites required for virion assembly and spread) confers a complex network of feedbacks leading to new configurations, which can evolve to maximize the virions stock, thus changing the system structure, output, and purpose. The dynamic trajectories will evolve to achieve a new stationary status, a phenomenon described in microbiology as integration and symbiosis when the system is resilient enough to the changes, or the system may stop functioning and die. Application of external driving forces, acting on processes, can affect the dynamic trajectories adding a further degree of complexity, which can be captured by ST approach, used to address these new configurations. Investigation of system configurations in response to external driving forces acting is developed by computational analysis based on ST diagrams, with the aim at designing novel therapeutic approaches.","Romano, Alessandra; Casazza, Marco; Gonella, Francesco",Front Microbiol,255,2

However, isolated optic neuritis was infrequently reported in humans with COVID-19. If it occurred, optic neuritis was usually a part of a demyelinating syndrome. Case presentation In this paper, we report a case of optic neuritis concomitant with an undiagnosed pituitary macroadenoma discovered during active COVID-19 infection. The case was a 33-year-old woman with infertility who was recently found to have a pituitary macroadenoma secreting prolactin. During active COVID-19 infection, the patient developed optic neuritis that responded well to corticosteroids. Brain imaging and hormonal profile negated the presence of any demyelinating disease or pituitary apoplexy. Clinical discussion A dilemma of whether optic neuritis occurring concomitantly with pituitary macroadenoma is just a coincidence, or there is an association remains unresolved. Whether COVID-19 infection might precipitate optic neuritis in patients with pituitary macroadenoma or not remains an issue to be answered by observing data from future case reports about similar findings. Conclusion Optic neuritis in concomitant with pituitary macroadenoma following COVID-19 infection represents a dilemma of whether the visual symptoms are attributed to the tumor or COVID-19 infection.","Al-Salihi, Mohammed Maan; Rahman, Md Moshiur; Al-Jebur, Maryam Sabah; Rahman, Sabrina; Lozada-Martinez, Ivan David; Rahman, Raphia; Moscote-Salazar, Luis Rafael",International journal of surgery open,255,20

In this study, we aimed to compare the clinical course of COVID-19 in adult SCD patients under the organ injury mitigation and clinical care improvement program (BASCARE) with healthcare professionals without significant comorbid conditions. The study was planned as a retrospective, multicenter and cross-sectional study. Thirty-nine SCD patients, ages 18 to 64 years, and 121 healthcare professionals, ages 21 to 53, were included in the study. The data were collected from the Electronic Health Recording System of PRANA, where SCD patients under the BASCARE program had been registered. The data of other patients were collected from the Electronic Hospital Data Recording System and patient files. In the SCD group, the crude incidence of COVID-19 was 9%, while in healthcare professionals at the same period was 23%. Among the symptoms, besides fever, loss of smell and taste were more prominent in the SCD group than in healthcare professionals. There was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of development of pneumonia, hospitalization, and need for intubation (43 vs 5%, P < 0.00001; 26 vs 7%, P = 0.002; and 10 vs 1%, P = 0.002, respectively). Prophylactic low molecular weight heparin and salicylate were used more in the SCD group than in healthcare professionals group (41 vs 9% and 28 vs 1%; P < 0.0001 for both). The 3-month mortality rate was demonstrated as 5% in the SCD group, while 0 in the healthcare professionals group. One patient in the SCD group became continously dependent on respiratory support. The cause of death was acute chest syndrome in the first case, hepatic necrosis and multi-organ failure in the second case. In conclusion, these observations supported the expectation that the course of COVID-19 in SCD patients will get worse. The BASCARE program applied in SCD patients could not change the poor outcome.","Boğa, Can; Asma, Süheyl; Leblebisatan, Göksel; Şen, Nazan; Tombak, Anıl; Demiroğlu, Yusuf Ziya; Yeral, Mahmut; Akın, Şule; Yeşilağaç, Hasan; Habeşoğlu, Mehmet Ali; Arıboğan, Anış; Kasar, Mutlu; Korur, Aslı; Özdoğu, Hakan",Ann Hematol,255,16

We conducted a comprehensive global study investigating the number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published on different health conditions, and how this compares with the global disease burden that they impose. METHODS: We use machine learning to monitor PubMed daily, and find and analyse RCT reports. We assessed RCTs investigating the leading causes of morbidity and mortality from the Global Burden of Disease study. Using regression models, we compared numbers of actual RCTs in different health conditions to numbers predicted from their global disease burden (disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)). We investigated whether RCT numbers differed for conditions disproportionately affecting countries with lower socioeconomic development. RESULTS: We estimate 463 000 articles describing RCTs (95% prediction interval 439 000 to 485 000) were published from 1990 to July 2020. RCTs recruited a median of 72 participants (IQR 32–195). 82% of RCTs were conducted by researchers in the top fifth of countries by socio-economic development. As DALYs increased for a particular health condition by 10%, the number of RCTs in the same year increased by 5% (3.2%–6.9%), but the association was weak (adjusted R(2)=0.13). Conditions disproportionately affecting countries with lower socioeconomic development, including respiratory infections and tuberculosis (7000 RCTs below predicted) and enteric infections (9700 RCTs below predicted), appear relatively under-researched for their disease burden. Each 10% shift in DALYs towards countries with low and middle socioeconomic development was associated with a 4% reduction in RCTs (3.7%–4.9%). These disparities have not changed substantially over time. CONCLUSION: Research priorities are not well optimised to reduce the global burden of disease. Most RCTs are produced by highly developed countries, and the health needs of these countries have been, on average, favoured.","Marshall, Iain James; L'Esperance, Veline; Marshall, Rachel; Thomas, James; Noel-Storr, Anna; Soboczenski, Frank; Nye, Benjamin; Nenkova, Ani; Wallace, Byron C",BMJ Glob Health,255,15

The manifestations of this disease are still being described in a variety of different contexts and patient populations. RESULTS: We report the case of a neonate who demonstrated COVID‐19 after surgical correction of transposition of the great arteries. In addition, the patient demonstrated an evolving and persistent tachyarrhythmia consistent with neither the most likely postoperative complications nor typical COVID‐19. DISCUSSION: The patient had negative preoperative testing for the virus and presented with profound oxygen desaturation and respiratory failure several days postoperatively. This raised concern for a complication of his arterial switch operation. It was found that one of the patient's caregivers was an asymptomatic carrier of COVID‐19, and imaging ruled out intracardiac shunting. After initiating treatment for COVID‐19, the patient's oxygen requirements and need for anti‐arrhythmic agents improved. CONCLUSION: We propose that, despite negative preoperative testing, coronavirus infection may present as refractory tachyarrhythmia, and may be considered along with surgical complications as a cause for unexplained hypoxemia postoperatively.","Lopez, Raymond A.; Padilla, Luz A.; Sorabella, Robert A.; Cleveland, David C.; Rhodes, Leslie A.; Dabal, Robert J.",J Card Surg,255,33

To uncover these events, we performed transcriptome analyses of lung biopsies from COVID-19 patients, revealing a gene enrichment pattern similar to that of PPARγ-knockout macrophages. Single-cell gene expression analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluids revealed a characteristic trajectory of PPARγ-related disturbance in the CD14+/CD16+ cells. We identified a correlation with the disease severity and the reduced expression of several members of the PPARγ complex such as EP300, RXRA, RARA, SUMO1, NR3C1, CCDC88A. CHIP-seq analyses confirmed repression of the PPARγ-RXRA-NR3C1 cistrome in COVID-19 lung samples. Further analysis of protein-protein networks highlighted an interaction between the PPARγ-associated protein SUMO1 and a nucleoprotein of the SARS virus. Overall, these results demonstrate for the first time, the involvement of the PPARγ complex in severe COVID-19 lung disease and suggest strongly its role in the major monocyte / macrophage-mediated inflammatory storm.","Desterke, Christophe; Turhan, Ali G.; Bennaceur-Griscelli, Annelise; Griscelli, Frank",iScience,255,32

Our method to estimate the reproduction number using Bayesian inference with time-dependent priors enhances previous approaches by considering a dynamic prior continuously updated as restrictive measures and comportments within the society evolve. In addition, to allow direct comparison between reproduction number and introduction of public health measures in a specific country, the infection dates are inferred from daily confirmed cases and confirmed death. The evolution of this reproduction number in combination with the stringency index is analyzed on 31 European countries. We show that most countries required tough state interventions with a stringency index equal to 79.6 out of 100 to reduce their reproduction number below one and control the progression of the pandemic. In addition, we show a direct correlation between the time taken to introduce restrictive measures and the time required to contain the spread of the pandemic with a median time of 8 days. This analysis is validated by comparing the excess deaths and the time taken to implement restrictive measures. Our analysis reinforces the importance of having a fast response with a coherent and comprehensive set of confinement measures to control the pandemic.

METHODS: Prospective repeated-measures cohort study on a sample of participants aged 60 and over. A total of 2, 785 respondents at the baseline (May 2019) were followed during the COVID-19 (August 2020). The changes in psychological distress before and during the COVID-19 were assessed using generalized estimation equations with adjusting for sex, age, education, economic status, marital status, tea drinking status, smoking status, alcohol drinking status, sedentary time, sleep quality and ADL. RESULTS: The psychological distress of older people has significantly increased in August 2020 compared with May 2019. Both older adults who remained frail and transitioned into frail state reported more psychological distress during the COVID-19. Similarly, both pre-existing multimorbidity and emerging multimorbidity groups were associated with more psychological distress. The group of frailty progression who reported new emerging multimorbidity showed more increase in psychological distress, in comparison with those remained non-frail state who reported no multimorbidity. CONCLUSION: Psychological distress has increased among the community-dwelling older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, and sustained and progressive frail state, as well as multimorbidity were all associated with a greater increase of psychological distress. These findings suggest that future public health measures should take into account the increased psychological distress among older people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the assessment of frailty and multimorbidity might help in warning of psychological distress.","Wang, Yi; Fu, Peipei; Li, Jie; Jing, Zhengyue; Wang, Qiong; Zhao, Dan; Zhou, Chengchao",Age Ageing,255,31

Often real-time PCR screening of large populations is a feasible method to generate this information. Since test capacities are usually limited, pooling of test specimens is often necessary to increase screening capacity, provided that the test sensitivity is not significantly compromised. However, when a traditional pool is tested positive, all samples in the pool need individual retesting, which becomes ineffective at a higher proportion of positive samples. Here, we report a new pooling protocol that mitigates this problem by replicating samples across multiple pools.

METHODS: Multicenter, retrospective study analyzing the at-admission pDd cut-off value to predict VTE and anticoagulation intensity along hospitalization due to COVID-19. RESULTS: Among 9386 patients, 2.2% had VTE: 1.6% pulmonary embolism (PE), 0.4% deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and 0.2% both. Those with VTE had a higher prevalence of tachypnea (42.9% vs. 31.1%; p = 0.0005), basal O2 saturation <93% (45.4% vs. 33.1%; p = 0.0003), higher at admission pDd (median [IQR]: 1.4 [0.6–5.5] vs. 0.6 [0.4–1.2] μg/ml; p < 0.0001) and platelet count (median [IQR]: 208 [158–289] vs. 189 [148–245] platelets × 10(9)/L; p = 0.0013).

With new examples occurring approximately one each year, the majority are viruses originating from an animal host. Of the many factors responsible, changes to local ecosystems that perturb the balance between pathogen and principal host species is one of the major drivers, together with increasing urbanization of mankind and changes in human behavior. Many emerging viruses have RNA genomes and as such are capable of rapid mutation and selection of new variants in the face of environmental changes in host numbers and available target species. This review summarizes recent work on aspects of virus emergence and the current understanding of the molecular and immunological basis whereby viruses may cross between species and become established in new ecological niches. Emergence is hard to predict, although mathematical modeling and spatial epidemiology have done much to improve the prediction of where emergence may occur. However, much needs to be done to ensure adequate surveillance is maintained of animal species known to present the greatest risk thus increasing general alertness among physicians, veterinarians and those responsible for formulating public health policy.","Howard, Colin R; Fletcher, Nicola F",Emerg Microbes Infect,255,20

Recent genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics studies have identified tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) as an oncogene that is frequently mutated or overexpressed in many types of cancer and metastases. A member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, TYK2 mediates the signals of numerous cytokines involved in immune and inflammatory signaling. In cancer cells, activation of TYK2 can lead to decreased cell death as well as increased cell growth and invasion. Multiple drugs that specifically block TYK2 or JAKs are currently FDA-approved or in clinical trials. In this review, we provide an overview of the screening, molecular, and animal studies that have characterized the role of TYK2 in cancer and metastases, and the potential of TYK2 inhibitors as effective cancer therapies. ABSTRACT: Advances in genomic analysis and proteomic tools have rapidly expanded identification of biomarkers and molecular targets important to cancer development and metastasis. On an individual basis, personalized medicine approaches allow better characterization of tumors and patient prognosis, leading to more targeted treatments by detection of specific gene mutations, overexpression, or activity. Genomic and proteomic screens by our lab and others have revealed tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) as an oncogene promoting progression and metastases of many types of carcinomas, sarcomas, and hematologic cancers. TYK2 is a Janus kinase (JAK) that acts as an intermediary between cytokine receptors and STAT transcription factors. TYK2 signals to stimulate proliferation and metastasis while inhibiting apoptosis of cancer cells. This review focuses on the growing evidence from genomic and proteomic screens, as well as molecular studies that link TYK2 to cancer prevalence, prognosis, and metastasis. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of TYK2 is currently used clinically for autoimmune diseases, and now provides promising treatment modalities as effective therapeutic agents against multiple types of cancer.","Borcherding, Dana C.; He, Kevin; Amin, Neha V.; Hirbe, Angela C.",Cancers (Basel),255,15

Objective: To examine whether there is an association between the importance of religious or spiritual beliefs and care preferences and palliative care needs in people who receive dialysis. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted among adults who were undergoing maintenance dialysis at 31 facilities in Seattle, Washington, and Nashville, Tennessee, between April 22, 2015, and October 2, 2018. The survey included a series of questions assessing patients' knowledge, preferences, values, and expectations related to end-of-life care. Data were analyzed from February 12, 2020, to April 21, 2021. Exposures: The importance of religious or spiritual beliefs was ascertained by asking participants to respond to this statement: ""My religious or spiritual beliefs are what really lie behind my whole approach to life."" Response options were definitely true, tends to be true, tends not to be true, or definitely not true. Main Outcomes and Measurements: Outcome measures were based on self-reported engagement in advance care planning, resuscitation preferences, values regarding life prolongation, preferred place of death, decision-making preference, thoughts or discussion about hospice or stopping dialysis, prognostic expectations, and palliative care needs. Results: A total of 937 participants were included in the cohort, of whom the mean (SD) age was 62.8 (13.8) years and 524 (55.9%) were men. Overall, 435 (46.4%) participants rated the statement about religious or spiritual beliefs as definitely true, 230 (24.6%) rated it as tends to be true, 137 (14.6%) rated it as tends not to be true, and 135 (14.4%) rated it as definitely not true. Participants for whom these beliefs were more important were more likely to prefer cardiopulmonary resuscitation (estimated probability for definitely true: 69.8% [95% CI, 66.5%-73.2%]; tends to be true: 60.8% [95% CI, 53.4%-68.3%]; tends not to be true: 61.6% [95% CI, 53.6%-69.6%]; and definitely not true: 60.6% [95% CI, 52.5%-68.6%]; P for trend = .003) and mechanical ventilation (estimated probability for definitely true: 42.6% [95% CI, 38.1%-47.0%]; tends to be true: 33.5% [95% CI, 25.9%-41.2%]; tends not to be true: 35.1% [95% CI, 27.2%-42.9%]; and definitely not true: 27.9% [95% CI, 19.6%-36.1%]; P for trend = .002) and to prefer a shared role in decision-making (estimated probability for definitely true: 41.6% [95% CI, 37.7%-45.5%]; tends to be true: 35.4% [95% CI, 29.0%-41.8%]; tends not to be true: 36.0% [95% CI, 26.7%-45.2%]; and definitely not true: 23.8% [95% CI, 17.3%-30.3%]; P for trend = .001) and were less likely to have thought or spoken about stopping dialysis. These participants were no less likely to have engaged in advance care planning, to value relief of pain and discomfort, to prefer to die at home, to have ever thought or spoken about hospice, and to have unmet palliative care needs and had similar prognostic expectations. Conclusions and Relevance: The finding that religious or spiritual beliefs were important to most study participants suggests the value of an integrative approach that addresses these beliefs in caring for people who receive dialysis.","Scherer, Jennifer S; Milazzo, Kaylin C; Hebert, Paul L; Engelberg, Ruth A; Lavallee, Danielle C; Vig, Elizabeth K; Kurella Tamura, Manjula; Roberts, Glenda; Curtis, J Randall; O039,; Hare, Ann M",JAMA Netw Open,255,24

The N95 mask is a prototype, high-efficiency protective device that can effectively protect against airborne pathogens of less than 0.3 μm. The N95 mask is tightly fitting and has high filtration capacity. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a greater requirement for FFR. This rising demand greatly exceeds current production capabilities and stockpiles, resulting in shortages. To address this, our team has invented a new type of half-piece respirator made from silicone and assembled with HEPA or elastostatic filter. A variety of methods have been used to evaluate this new device, including a qualitative fit test with the Bitrex® test kit and filtration test. The preliminary results showed that the new N99 respirators pass the fit test. The filtration tests also confirmed the superiority of N99 over traditional N95 masks, with a mean performance of protection greater than 95%. For the filters, we used two types: SafeStar, which is a kind of HEPA filter; and CareStar, which is considered an elastostatic filler. CareStar was developed to filter virus and bacteria in the operating room, with a limit duration of use up to 24 h, while the safe star was designed for 72 h use and has the quality equivalent to a HEPA filter. Our study demonstrated superior filtration efficacy of both filters, more than 98% even after 24 h of use. CareStar has significantly more filtration efficacy than a safe star (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the development of our new N99 half-piece respirator should ultimately be applicable to healthcare workers with at least non-inferiority to the previously used N 95 respirators.. Currently, the adequate supply of such equipment is not feasible. The advent of the new protective device will help protect healthcare workers and replenish the shortage of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Manomaipiboon, Anan; Pupipatpab, Sujaree; Chomdee, Pongsathorn; Boonyapatkul, Pathiporn; Trakarnvanich, Thananda",bioRxiv,255,1

METHODS: Logistic regression analysis was utilized to test the effects of MetS and its indicators on the incidence of DR and vision-related functional burden. The spline smoothing functions of continuous indicators of MetS were used to establish the logistic generalized additive model (GAM). The effective degree of freedom (EDF) =1 was served as a sign of linear relationship. EDF>1 was a sign of a more complex association between MetS and DR. RESULTS: The proportion of difficulties of looking for objects on the crowded shelves in the DR group was higher than that in the non-DR group (19.40 vs 12.10, P<0.05). Elevated fasting glucose (Glu) and blood pressure levels were related to the vision-related functional burden. The risk of DR development increased by 6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03–1.09, P<0.001] and 1% (95% CI: 1.01–1.02, P=0.004) per 1 unit increase in Glu and systolic blood pressure (SBP) of DM patients, respectively. In the univariate GAM, Glu had a linear effect on DR (EDF=1, P<0.001) with a positive correlation after controlling SBP. And there was a nonlinear correlation between SBP and DR after controlling Glu (EDF=2.44, P=0.024). CONCLUSION: Both Glu and blood pressure were associated with the occurrence of DR and vision-related functional burden. Controlling the levels of Glu and blood pressure may reduce the risk of DR and vision loss among DM patients.","Sun, Qing; Tang, Liang; Zeng, Qiurong; Gu, Mingjun",Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,255,22

This study aimed to reveal whether there is a significant relationship between the level of internet addiction of university students and their age and self-esteem. For this purpose, internet addiction and self-esteem scales were used in addition to questions such as age, gender, the purpose of internet use, and internet daily usage time. We used a quantitative research method to obtain cross-sectional data from 400 Turkish young people using online surveys. Correlation, regression, mediation, and moderation analyses were performed using SPSS and the PROCESS macro plugin for data analysis. Internet addiction was significantly associated with self-esteem, gender, age, and daily internet usage. In addition, we discovered that self-esteem and daily usage time played a mediation role in the effect of the age variable on internet addiction. Moreover, the moderation roles of social networks, gender, and location in the impact of self-esteem on internet addiction were determined. With this study, we understood that as age increases, self-esteem triggers the decrease of internet addiction. In this sense, policies should be developed to increase self-esteem among young people to ensure the conscious use of the internet.","Koçak, Orhan; Yılmaz, İlayda; Younis, Mustafa Z.",Healthcare (Basel),255,20

The methods used have significant differences based on tissue source, cell isolation, culture conditions, and assessment of culture purity. We modified and optimized a method for generating tracheal epithelial cultures from Syrian golden hamsters and characterized the cultures for cell composition and function. Soon after initial plating, the epithelial cells reached a high transepithelial resistance and formed tight junctions. The cells differentiated into a heterogeneous, multicellular culture containing ciliated, secretory, and basal cells after culture at an air-liquid interface (ALI). The, secretory cell populations initially consisted of MUC5AC-positive goblet cells and MUC5AC/CCSP double-positive cells, but the makeup changed to predominantly Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP)-positive Clara cells after 14 d. The ciliated cell populations differentiated rapidly after ALI as judged by the appearance of β tubulin IV-positive cells. The cultures produced mucus, CCSP, and trypsin-like proteases and were capable of wound repair as judged by increased expression of matrilysin.

METHODS: Two hundred and three students (76.4% women, mean age 24.3, SD ± 4.9) responded to an anonymous online cross-sectional survey between July 15 and September 30, 2020, on DE experience and cognitive and social-cognitive variables. A short version of the Beck Depression Inventory-II, ten images from the Eyes Task, and five memory vignette stimuli were included in the survey. Descriptive, one-way ANOVA, correlation, and logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Half of the student sample reported significant impairment in concentration and learning abilities during DE. Regarding psychological health, 19.7%, 27.1%, and 23.6% of the sample reported mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms, respectively. Correlation analyses showed a statistically significant negative association between depression and the overall subjective evaluation of DE (r = − 0.359; p < 0.000). Changes in one’s study context and habits, i.e., studying alone at one’s parents’ home instead of studying with colleagues or alone in a university “social place” (e.g., the university library), seemed to increase the likelihood of poor academic performance by almost 3 times (O.R. 3.918; p = 0.032). This predictor was no longer statistically significant in the subsequent step when the individual impairment predictors were entered. Learning concentration impairment during DE (O.R. 8.350; p = 0.014), anxiety about COVID-19 contagion for oneself or others (O.R. 3.363; p = 0.022), female gender (O.R. 3.141; p = 0.045), and depressive symptomatology (O.R. 1.093; p = 0.047) were ultimately determined to be the strongest predictors of poor academic performance, whereas the appreciation of DE represented a protective variable (O.R. 0.610; p < 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: The study showed a negative impact of DE on the mental health of students presenting depressive symptoms and impairment in concentration and learning, the latter identified as the strongest predictors of poor academic performances. The study confirms the emerging need to monitor the impact of DE, which occurred during the 2019/2020 academic year and will continue in the coming months, to refine educational offerings and meet students' psychological needs by implementing psychological interventions based on the modifiable variables that seem to compromise students’ psychological well-being and academic outcomes.

Mutations R203K/G204R on N, carried by high transmissibility SARS-CoV-2 lineages including B.1.1.7 and P.1, has a rapid spread in the pandemic during the past year. In this study, we performed comprehensive population genomic analyses and virology experiment concerning on the evolution, causation and virology consequence of R203K/G204R mutations. The global incidence frequency (IF) of 203K/204R has rose up from nearly zero to 76% to date with a shrinking from August to November in 2020 but bounced later. Our results show that the emergence of B.1.1.7 is associated with the second growth of R203K/G204R mutants. We identified positive selection evidences that support the adaptiveness of 203K/204R variants. The R203K/G204R mutant virus was created and compared with the native virus. The virus competition experiments show that 203K/204R variants possess a replication advantage over the preceding R203/G204 variants, possibly in relation to the ribonucleocapsid (RNP) assemble during the virus replication. Moreover, the 203K/204R virus increased the infectivity in a human lung cell line and induced an enhanced damage to blood vessel of infected hamsters’ lungs. In consistence, we observed a positive association between the increased severity of COVID-19 and the IF of 203K/204R from in silicon analysis of global clinical and epidemic data.

Our objective is to investigate the comparative effectiveness of various CHIs strategies for elderly patients with pneumonia. Methods: A comprehensive search strategy was executed to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by browsing through several databases from their inception to first, Feb 2020; All of the direct and indirect evidence included was rated by Network meta-analysis under a Bayesian framework. Results: We ultimately identified 34 eligible randomized controlled trials that involved 3,111 elderly participants and investigated 4 CHIs combined with Western medicine (WM) (Xiyanping injection [XYP]+WM, Yanhuning injection [YHN]+WM, Tanreqing injection [TRQ]+WM, Reduning injection [RDN]+WM), contributing 34 direct comparisons between CHIs. Seen from the outcome of Clinical effective rate and time for defervescence, patients taking medicine added with CHIs [Clinical effective rate, XYP + WM(Odd ratio (OR): 0.74, 95%Credible intervals (CrIs):0.55–0.98), YHN + WM(OR: 0.66, 95%CrI: 0.45–0.95), TRQ + WM(OR: 0.65, 95%CrI: 0.50–0.83), RDN + WM(OR: 0.60, 95%CrI: 0.40–0.89); Time for defervescence, YHN + WM(Mean difference (MD): −2.11, 95%CrI: −3.26 to −0.98), XYP + WM(MD: −2.06, 95%CrI: −3.08 to −1.09), RDN + WM(MD: −1.97, 95%CrI: −3.61 to −0.35), TRQ + WM(MD: −1.69, 95%CrI: −2.27 to −1.04)] showed statistically better effect compared with participants in the Control group (CG) who only took WM. Meanwhile, based on the time for disappearance of cough, 3 out of 4 CHIs [TRQ + WM(MD: −2.56, 95%CrI: −3.38 to −1.54), YHN + WM(MD: −2.36, 95%CrI: −3.86 to −1.00) and XYP + WM(MD: −2.21, 95%CrI: −3.72 to −1.10)] strategies indicated improvement of clinical symptoms. Only XYP + WM(MD −1.78, 95%CrI: −3.29 to −0.27) and TRQ + WM (MD: −1.71, 95%CrI: −2.71 to −0.73) could significantly shorten the time for disappearance of pulmonary rales. Conclusion: According to the statistical effect size (The surface under the cumulative ranking), we found that XYP + WM was presumably to be the preferable treatment for treating elderly patients with pneumonia compared with WM alone in terms of clinical effective rate. Our findings were based on very limited evidence and thus should be interpreted with caution. The application of the findings requires further research.","Yuan, Yang; Zheng, Quan; Si, Zhilin; Liu, Juhua; Li, Zhi; Xiong, Lian; Liu, Pan; Li, Xu; He, Chengshi; Liang, Jinghong",Front Pharmacol,255,18

The IP test did not react with sera from either 15 specific pathogen-free (SPF) dogs or 7 SPF dogs immunized with a multivalent vaccine, including canine parvovirus type 2, canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus type 2, and canine parainfluenza virus. To compare the IP test with the neutralizing test (NT), sera from 240 healthy dogs and from 3 experimentally CCV-infected dogs were examined. All 60 sera positive for NT antibody were positive for IP antibody, and all 180 sera negative for NT antibody were negative for IP antibody in the healthy dogs. The IP titres showed similar changes with time after CCV inoculation to those of the NT titres in the experimentally infected dogs. These findings indicate that the IP test specifically detected anti-CCV antibodies. When the IP test and NT were compared in dogs with diarrhoeic signs. 2.1% of 48 sera and 20.3% of 74 sera, which were all negative for NT antibody, were positive for IP antibody in the dogs of under one year of age and at least one year of age, respectively. The difference between the IP and NT titres (log(10) [reciprocal of IP titre] – log(10) [reciprocal of NT titre]) for the diarrhoeic dogs of under one year of age (2.350±0.931) was significantly larger than that for the healthy dogs (0.982±0.447) (p<0.0001), the NT titre being negative or very low, despite a high IP titre in many diarrhoeic dogs. Hence, the IP test is more able to detect anti-CCV antibodies, especially in dogs showing clinical signs. The IP-positivity rate was significantly higher in the diarrhoeic dogs of under one year of age (48.7%) than in the healthy dogs (25.0%) (χ(2) = 19.844, p<0.0001), suggesting that CCV may contribute to diarrhoea in many juvenile dogs.","Soma, T.; Hara, M.; Ishii, H.; Yamamoto, S.",Vet Res Commun,255,21

Benzaldehydes from depolymerized lignin, such as vanillin, syringaldehyde, and 4-methoxy benzaldehyde, represent renewable feedstocks for the synthesis of ionic liquids. We herein report syntheses of novel lignin-derived ionic liquids, with extended N-alkyl chains, and examine their melting points, cellulose dissolution capacities, and toxicity profiles against Daphnia magna and E. coli strain 1A1. The latter organism has been engineered to produce isoprenol, a drop-in biofuel and precursor for commodity chemicals. RESULTS: The new N,N-diethyl and N,N-dipropyl methyl benzylammonium ILs were liquids at room temperature, showing 75–100 °C decreased melting points as compared to their N,N,N-trimethyl benzylammonium analog. Extension of N-alkyl chains also increased antibacterial activity threefold, while ionic liquids prepared from vanillin showed 2- to 4-fold lower toxicity as compared to those prepared from syringaldehyde and 4-methoxybenzaldehyde. The trend of antibacterial activity for anions of lignin-derived ILs was found to be methanesulfonate < acetate < hydroxide. Microcrystalline cellulose dissolution, from 2 to 4 wt% after 20 min at 100 °C, was observed in all new ILs using light microscopy and IR spectroscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Ionic liquids prepared from H-, S- and G-lignin oxidation products provided differential cytotoxic activity against E. coli and D. magna, suggesting these compounds could be tailored for application specificity within a biorefinery.","Liu, Shihong; Gonzalez, Michael; Kong, Celine; Weir, Scott; Socha, Aaron M.",Biotechnol Biofuels,255,1

Non-invasive mechanical ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula can reduce the rate of endotracheal intubation in adult respiratory distress syndrome, although failure rate is high. OBJECTIVE: To describe the rate of endotracheal intubation, the effectiveness of treatment, complications and mortality in patients with severe respiratory failure due to COVID-19. METHODS: Prospective cohort study in a first-level hospital in Madrid. Patients with a positive polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 and admitted to the Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit with tachypnea, use of accessory musculature or Sp(O2) <92% despite Fi(O2)> 0.5 were included. Intubation rate, medical complications, and 28-day mortality were recorded. Statistical analysis through association studies, logistic and Cox regression models and survival analysis was performed. RESULTS: Seventy patients were included. 37.1% required endotracheal intubation, 58.6% suffered medical complications and 24.3% died. Prone positioning was independently associated with lower need for endotracheal intubation (OR 0.05; 95% CI 0.005 to 0.54, p = 0.001). The adjusted HR for death at 28 days in the group of patients requiring endotracheal intubation was 5.4 (95% CI 1.51 to 19.5; p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of endotracheal intubation in patients with severe respiratory failure from COVID-19 was 37.1%. Complications and mortality were lower in patients in whom endotracheal intubation could be avoided.

It has also been associated with encephalitis recently by detection of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients presented with encephalitis. This retrospective study aimed to present clinical features of HBOV infections in children with respiratory symptoms and describe unexplained encephalopathy in a subgroup of these patients. Results of 1,143 pediatric nasal samples from mid‐December 2013 to July 2014 were reviewed for detection of HBOV. A multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction assay was used for viral detection. Medical records of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. HBOV was detected in 30 patients (2.6%). Median age was 14 months (5–80). Clinical diagnoses were upper respiratory tract infection (n = 10), bronchopneumonia (n = 9), acute bronchiolitis (n = 5), pneumonia (n = 4), acute bronchitis (n = 1), and asthma execarbation (n = 1). Hospitalization was required in 16 (53.3%) patients and 10 (62.5%) of them admitted to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Noninvasive mechanical ventilation modalities was applied to four patients and mechanical ventilation to four patients. Intractable seizures developed in four patients while mechanically ventilated on the 2nd–3rd days of PICU admission. No specific reason for encephalopathy was found after a thorough investigation. No mortality was observed, but two patients were discharged with neurological sequela. HBOV may lead to respiratory infections in a wide spectrum of severity. This report indicates its potential to cause severe respiratory infections requiring PICU admission and highlights possible clinical association of HBOV and encephalopathy, which developed during severe respiratory infection.

He was diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia; however, there was a delay in the diagnosis of TB because of the patient's refusal of lymph node biopsy and late recognition of the association between TB and immune thrombocytopenia. Treatment with steroids without antituberculosis medications may have led to reactivation and dissemination of tuberculous infection in this patient.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the molecular epidemiology of HRV infections in young children seeking acute medical care. STUDY DESIGN: Nasal swabs collected from symptomatic children <3 years of age receiving care in the Emergency and Urgent Care Departments at Seattle Children's Hospital were analyzed by a rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system (FilmArray®) for multiple viruses including HRV/enterovirus. HRV-positive results were confirmed by laboratory-developed real-time reverse transcription PCR (LD-PCR). Clinical data were collected by chart review. A subset of samples was selected for sequencing using the 5’ noncoding region. Associations between LRTI and HRV species and genotypes were estimated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 595 samples with HRV/enterovirus detected by FilmArray, 474 (80%) were confirmed as HRV by LD-PCR. 211 (96%) of 218 selected samples were sequenced; HRV species A, B, and C were identified in 133 (63%), 6 (3%), and 72 (34%), respectively.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the altered pathological inflammation in COVID-19 are largely unknown. We report here that toll-like receptor (TLR) 4-mediated inflammatory signaling molecules are upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients, compared with healthy controls (HC). METHODS: A total of 48 subjects including 28 COVID-19 patients (8 severe/critical vs. 20 mild/moderate cases) admitted to Chungnam National University Hospital, and age/sex-matched 20 HC were enrolled in this study. PBMCs from the subjects were processed for nCounter Human Immunology gene expression assay to analyze the immune related transcriptome profiles. Recombinant proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) were used to stimulate the PBMCs and monocyte-derived macrophages, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify the mRNA expressions of the pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. RESULTS: Among the most highly increased inflammatory mediators in severe/critically ill patients, S100A9, an alarmin and TLR4 ligand, was found as a noteworthy biomarker, because it inversely correlated with the serum albumin levels. We also observed that recombinant S2 and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 significantly increased pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and S100A9 in human primary PBMCs. CONCLUSION: These data support a link between TLR4 signaling and pathological inflammation during COVID-19 and contribute to develop therapeutic approaches through targeting TLR4-mediated inflammation.","Sohn, Kyung Mok; Lee, Sung-Gwon; Kim, Hyeon Ji; Cheon, Shinhyea; Jeong, Hyeongseok; Lee, Jooyeon; Kim, In Soo; Silwal, Prashanta; Kim, Young Jae; Paik, Seungwha; Chung, Chaeuk; Park, Chungoo; Kim, Yeon-Sook; Jo, Eun-Kyeong",J Korean Med Sci,255,1

However, while hundreds to thousands of nuclear genomes of parasitic protozoa have been generated and analyzed, information about the diversity, structure and evolution of their mitochondrial genomes remains fragmentary, mainly because of their extraordinary complexity. Indeed, unicellular flagellates of the order Kinetoplastida contain structurally the most complex mitochondrial genome of all eukaryotes, organized as a giant network of homogeneous maxicircles and heterogeneous minicircles. We recently developed KOMICS, an analysis toolkit that automates the assembly and circularization of the mitochondrial genomes of Kinetoplastid parasites. While this tool overcomes the limitation of extracting mitochondrial assemblies from Next-Generation Sequencing datasets, interpreting and visualizing the genetic (dis)similarity within and between samples remains a time-consuming process. RESULTS: Here, we present a new analysis toolkit-rKOMICS-to streamline the analyses of minicircle sequence diversity in population-scale genome projects. rKOMICS is a user-friendly R package that has simple installation requirements and that is applicable to all 27 trypanosomatid genera. Once minicircle sequence alignments are generated, rKOMICS allows to examine, summarize and visualize minicircle sequence diversity within and between samples through the analyses of minicircle sequence clusters. We showcase the functionalities of the (r)KOMICS tool suite using a whole-genome sequencing dataset from a recently published study on the history of diversification of the Leishmania braziliensis species complex in Peru. Analyses of population diversity and structure highlighted differences in minicircle sequence richness and composition between Leishmania subspecies, and between subpopulations within subspecies. CONCLUSION: The rKOMICS package establishes a critical framework to manipulate, explore and extract biologically relevant information from mitochondrial minicircle assemblies in tens to hundreds of samples simultaneously and efficiently. This should facilitate research that aims to develop new molecular markers for identifying species-specific minicircles, or to study the ancestry of parasites for complementary insights into their evolutionary history.","Geerts, Manon; Schnaufer, Achim; Van den Broeck, Frederik",BMC Bioinformatics,255,1

METHODS: We followed up 460 subjects suspected of TB, and finally enrolled 132 patients, including 60 TB patients, 24 non‐TB disease controls (TB‐DCs), and 48 healthy controls (HCs). The differential expression of miR‐30c and miR‐142‐3p in serum samples of the TB patients, TB‐DCs, and HCs were identified by reverse transcription–quantitative real‐time PCR. Diagnostic models were developed by analyzing the characteristics of miRNA and electronic health records (EHRs). These models evaluated by the area under the curves (AUC) and calibration curves were presented as nomograms. RESULTS: There were differential expression of miR‐30c and miR‐142‐3p between TB patients and HCs (p < 0.05). Individual miRNA has a limited diagnostic value for TB. However, diagnostic performance has been both significantly improved when we integrated miR‐142‐3p and ordinary EHRs to develop two models for the diagnosis of tuberculosis.

By contrast with influenza viruses, little is known about the contemporaneous global diversity of these viruses, and the relevance of such for development of pharmaceutical interventions. Although far less advanced than for influenza, antiviral drugs and vaccines are in different stages of development for several of these viruses, but no interventions have been licensed. This scarcity of global genetic data represents a substantial knowledge gap and impediment to the eventual licensing of new antiviral drugs and vaccines for NIRVs. Enhanced genetic surveillance will assist and boost research and development into new antiviral drugs and vaccines for these viruses. Additionally, understanding the global diversity of respiratory viruses is also part of emerging disease preparedness, because non-human coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses have been listed as priority concerns in a recent WHO research and development blueprint initiative for emerging infectious diseases. In this Personal View, we explain further the rationale for expanding the genetic database of NIRVs and emphasise the need for greater investment in this area of research.","Tang, Julian W; Lam, Tommy T; Zaraket, Hassan; Lipkin, W Ian; Drews, Steven J; Hatchette, Todd F; Heraud, Jean-Michel; Koopmans, Marion P; Abraham, Ashta Mary; Baraket, Amal; Bialasiewicz, Seweryn; Caniza, Miguela A; Chan, Paul KS; Cohen, Cheryl; Corriveau, André; Cowling, Benjamin J; Echavarria, Marcela; Fouchier, Ron; Fraaij, Pieter LA; Hachette, Todd F; Jalal, Hamid; Jennings, Lance; Kabanda, Alice; Kadjo, Herve A; Khanani, Mohammed Rafiq; Koay, Evelyn SC; Krajden, Mel; Lee, Hong Kai; Lipkin, W.

We feel a contrast between these measures and our freedom. This contrast, we argue, is a false perception. It only appears to us because we look at the issue through our contemporary moral philosophy of utilitarianism and an understanding of freedom as absence of constraints. Both these views can be substituted with more sophisticated alternatives, namely an ethics of virtue and a notion of freedom of the will. These offer a fuller picture of morality and enable us to cooperate with the current restrictions by consciously choosing to adhere to them instead of perceiving them as draconian and immoral. We ask whether we should collaborate with the restrictions and argue that considerations of virtue will lead to an affirmative answer. More broadly, virtue ethics permits to deal with the practical concerns about how an individual should behave during this pandemic, given the current lockdown measures or lack thereof. In section 1, we present how utilitarianism and a notion of freedom as negative liberty support the opposition to restrictive measures. In section 2, we outline an alternative based on an ethics of virtue and a more elaborated notion of free will. In the concluding section 3 we argue that considerations of virtue should guide the individual and public response to the emergency.","Bellazzi, Francesca; Boyneburgk, Konrad v",J Law Biosci,255,27

This study aimed to explore the roles of ACE2, apelin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in SARS-CoV-2-mediated cardiorenal damage. METHODS AND RESULTS: The published RNA-sequencing datasets of cardiomyocytes infected with SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 patients were used. String, UMAP plots and single cell RNA sequencing data were analyzed to show the close relationship and distinct cardiorenal distribution patterns of ACE2, apelin and SGLT2. Intriguingly, there were decreases in ACE2 and apelin expression as well as marked increases in SGLT2 and endothelin-1 levels in SARS-CoV-2-infected cardiomyocytes, animal models with diabetes, acute kidney injury, heart failure and COVID-19 patients. These changes were linked with downregulated levels of interleukin (IL)-10, superoxide dismutase 2 and catalase as well as upregulated expression of profibrotic genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Genetic ACE2 deletion resulted in upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines containing IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17 and tumor necrosis factor α. More importantly, dapagliflozin strikingly alleviated cardiorenal fibrosis in diabetic db/db mice by suppressing SGLT2 levels and potentiating the apelin-ACE2 signaling. CONCLUSION: Downregulation of apelin and ACE2 and upregulation of SGLT2, endothelin-1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines contribute to SARS-CoV-2-mediated cardiorenal injury, indicating that the apelin-ACE2 signaling and SGLT2 inhibitors are potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19 patients.","Li, Xue-Ting; Zhang, Mi-Wen; Zhang, Zhen-Zhou; Cao, Yu-Dan; Liu, Xiao-Yan; Miao, Ran; Xu, Yuan; Song, Xiao-Fang; Song, Jia-Wei; Liu, Ying; Xu, Ying-Le; Li, Jing; Dong, Ying; Zhong, Jiu-Chang",Int J Cardiol,255,31

However, HCTs for COVID‐19 pose ethical and practical challenges, in part due to the unclear and developing risks. In this article , we introduce an interactive model for exploring some risks of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐COV‐2) dosing study, a prerequisite for any COVID‐19 challenge trials. The risk estimates we use are based on a Bayesian evidence synthesis model which can incorporate new data on infection fatality risks (IFRs) to patients, and infer rates of hospitalization. The model estimates individual risk, which we then extrapolate to overall mortality and hospitalization risk in a dosing study. We provide a web tool to explore risk under different study designs. Based on the Bayesian model, IFR for someone between 20 and 30 years of age is 15.1 in 100,000, with a 95% uncertainty interval from 11.8 to 19.2, while risk of hospitalization is 130 per 100,000 (100–160). However, risk will be reduced in an HCT via screening for comorbidities, selecting lower‐risk population, and providing treatment. Accounting for this with stronger assumptions, we project the fatality risk to be as low as 2.5 per 100,000 (1.6–3.9) and the hospitalization risk to be 22.0 per 100,000 (14.0–33.7). We therefore find a 50‐person dosing trial has a 99.74% (99.8–99.9%) chance of no fatalities, and a 98.9% (98.3–99.3%) probability of no cases requiring hospitalization.","Manheim, David; Wiȩcek, Witold; Schmit, Virginia; Morrison, Josh",Risk Anal,255,30

SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, which exhibits wide variation in the course of disease in different people, ranging from asymptomatic and mild courses to very severe courses that can result in respiratory failure and death. Despite the rapid progression of knowledge, we still do not know how individual cells of the immune system interact with the virus or its components, or how immune homeostasis becomes disrupted, leading to the rapid deterioration of a patient’s condition. In the present work, we show that SARS-CoV-2 proteins induce the expression and secretion of IL-6 by human monocytes and macrophages, the first line cells of antiviral immune responses. IL-6 may play a negative role in the course of COVID-19 by inhibiting Th1-dependent immunity and stimulating Th17 lymphocytes, thus leading to an increased probability of a cytokine storm.","Karwaciak, Iwona; Sałkowska, Anna; Karaś, Kaja; Dastych, Jarosław; Ratajewski, Marcin",Vaccines (Basel),255,28

In this study we evaluated the influence of commensal bacterial [two strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. reuteri] colonization and rotavirus infection on distribution and frequencies of monocytes/macrophages and conventional DCs (cDCs) in ileum, spleen and blood. Gnotobiotic pigs were inoculated with LAB and virulent Wa strain human rotavirus (HRV) (LAB+HRV+), HRV only (LAB−HRV+), LAB only (LAB+HRV−) or mock (LAB−HRV−). The cDCs were characterized as SWC3(+)CD11R1(+), whereas monocytes/macrophages were identified as SWC3(+)CD11R1(−) by flow cytometry in the gnotobiotic pigs at 10 days of age. Infection with HRV alone activated/recruited significantly more monocytes/macrophages to the intestine than LAB colonization and 56% versus 28% of these cells expressed CD14. Colonization with LAB alone also significantly increased the frequencies of monocytes/macrophages and cDCs and the CD14 expression on monocytes/macrophages in ileum and spleen compared to the controls. LAB colonization plus HRV infection significantly reduced macrophage and cDC frequencies in spleen compared to LAB colonization or HRV infection alone, suggesting that LAB colonization down-regulated HRV− infection-induced monocyte/macrophage activation/recruitment at the systemic lymphoid tissue. These results illustrated the distribution of porcine monocytes/macrophages and cDCs and the frequencies of CD14 expression on these cells in intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues in the early stage of immune responses to intestinal colonization by LAB versus infection by an enteric pathogen HRV and will facilitate further in vivo studies on functional characterization of these immune cells in neonates.","Zhang, Wei; Wen, Ke; Azevedo, Marli S.P.; Gonzalez, Ana; Saif, Linda J.; Li, Guohua; Yousef, Ahmed E.; Yuan, Lijuan",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,255,1

Here, we describe a novel approach for siRNA cellular delivery using siRNA encapsulated into liposomes additionally bearing arginine octamer (R8) molecules attached to their outer surface (R8-liposomes). The R8-liposomal human double minute gene 2 (HDM2)-siRNA demonstrated a significant stability against degradation in the blood serum (siRNA-loaded R8-liposomes remained intact even after 24-h incubation), and higher transfection efficiency into all three tested lung tumor cell lines. siRNA delivery successfully proceeds in the presence of plasma proteins, and R8-liposomes demonstrate low non-specific toxicity. The mechanism of action of R8-liposome-encapsulated siRNA is associated with the RNAi-mediated degradation of the target mRNA. siRNA in R8-liposomes effectively inhibited the targeted gene and significantly reduced the proliferation of cancer cells. The approach offers the potential for siRNA delivery for various in vitro and in vivo applications.","Zhang, Chunling; Tang, Ning; Liu, XingJun; Liang, Wei; Xu, Wei; Torchilin, Vladimir P.",J Control Release,255,24

METHODS: We interviewed and surveyed experts (in total, n=24) across key digital health stakeholder groups—venture capitalists, digital health companies, payers, and health care system providers or leaders—guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that external policy, regulatory demands, internal organizational workflow, and integration needs often take priority over patient needs and patient preferences for digital health tools, which lowers patient acceptance rates. We discovered alignment, across all 4 stakeholder groups, in the desire to engage both patients and frontline health care providers in broader dissemination and evaluation of digital health tools. However, major areas of misalignment between stakeholder groups have stymied the progress of digital health tool uptake—venture capitalists and companies focused on external policy and regulatory demands, while payers and providers focused on internal organizational workflow and integration needs.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the performance of multiple blood biomarkers in elucidating stroke etiology with a focus on new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) and cardioembolism. METHODS: Between January and December 2017, information on clinical and laboratory parameters and stroke characteristics was prospectively collected from ischemic stroke patients recruited from the National University Hospital, Singapore. Multiple blood biomarkers (N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP], d-dimer, S100ß, neuron-specific enolase, vitamin D, cortisol, interleukin-6, insulin, uric acid, and albumin) were measured in plasma. These variables were compared with stroke etiology and the risk of new-onset AF and cardioembolism using multivariable regression methods. RESULTS: Of the 515 ischemic stroke patients (mean age 61 years; 71% men), 44 (8.5%) were diagnosed with new-onset AF, and 75 (14.5%) had cardioembolism. The combination of 2 laboratory parameters (total cholesterol ≤169 mg/dL; triglycerides ≤44.5 mg/dL) and 3 biomarkers (NT-proBNP ≥294 pg/mL; S100ß ≥64 pg/mL; cortisol ≥471 nmol/l) identified patients with new-onset AF (negative predictive value [NPV] 90%; positive predictive value [PPV] 73%; area under curve [AUC] 85%). The combination of 2 laboratory parameters (total cholesterol ≤169 mg/dL; triglycerides ≤44.5 mg/dL) and 2 biomarkers (NT-proBNP ≥507 pg/mL; S100ß ≥65 pg/mL) identified those with cardioembolism (NPV 86%; PPV 78%; AUC 87%).

OBJECTIVE: To address this research gap, the aim of this article is to document the subjective dimensions of physicians’ work during the peak of the pandemic for comparison with a pre-COVID-19 situation. In addition, the relationship between workload and the individual characteristics of the physician or the percentage of tele-assistance is examined. METHODS: This study performs a subjective measurement procedure for the analysis of work overload through the NASA-TLX questionnaire, with a total of 102 records from 16 doctors from a Primary Health Centers of the Granada-Metropolitan Health district (Andalusia, Spain).

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey linked to 3 active clinical trials and 1 cohort study. SETTING: 5 academic internal medicine practices and 2 federally qualified health centers. PATIENTS: 630 adults aged 23 to 88 years living with 1 or more chronic conditions. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to COVID-19. RESULTS: A fourth (24.6%) of participants were “very worried” about getting the coronavirus. Nearly a third could not correctly identify symptoms (28.3%) or ways to prevent infection (30.2%). One in 4 adults (24.6%) believed that they were “not at all likely” to get the virus, and 21.9% reported that COVID-19 had little or no effect on their daily routine. One in 10 respondents was very confident that the federal government could prevent a nationwide outbreak. In multivariable analyses, participants who were black, were living below the poverty level, and had low health literacy were more likely to be less worried about COVID-19, to not believe that they would become infected, and to feel less prepared for an outbreak.

The interrelations between these markets have not been accounted for in the existing energy system modelling efforts, leading to a distortion of understanding of the market impact on the technological choices and operations in the real world. This study investigates the strategic and operational decision-making problem for such an energy system characterized by three competing technologies from crude oil, natural gas, and coal. A stochastic programming model is constructed by incorporating multiple volatile energy prices interrelated with each other. Oil price is modelled by the mean-reverting Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process and serves as the exogenous variable in the ARIMAX models for natural gas and downstream plastic prices. The K-means clustering method is employed to extract a handful of distinctive patterns from a large number of simulated price projections to enhance the computing efficiency without losing retaining critical information and insights from the price co-movement. The model results suggest that the high volatility of the energy market weakens the possibility of selecting the corresponding technology. The oil-based route, for example, gradually loses its market share to the coal approach, attributed to a higher volatile oil market. The proposed method is applicable to other problems of the same kind with high-dimensional stochastic variables.

Reduced income dispersion reduced mortality (RR=0.88; 95%CI: 0.83–0.93) and the number of critical cases (RR=0.92; 95% CI: 0.87–0.97). Rapid border closures, full lockdowns, and wide-spread testing were not associated with COVID-19 mortality per million people. However, full lockdowns (RR=2.47: 95%CI: 1.08–5.64) and reduced country vulnerability to biological threats (i.e. high scores on the global health security scale for risk environment) (RR=1.55; 95%CI: 1.13–2.12) were significantly associated with increased patient recovery rates. INTERPRETATION: In this exploratory analysis, low levels of national preparedness, scale of testing and population characteristics were associated with increased national case load and overall mortality.","Chaudhry, Rabail; Dranitsaris, George; Mubashir, Talha; Bartoszko, Justyna; Riazi, Sheila",EClinicalMedicine,255,1

This contrasted with its Scandinavian neighbours which implemented stringent restrictions. The influence these different approaches had on mobility, and thus on COVID-19 mortality was investigated. METHODS: Datasets indicating restriction severity and community mobility were examined; Google's ‘Community Movement Reports' (CMR) show activity at key location categories; the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker collates legislative restrictions into a ‘Stringency Index’ (SI). RESULTS: CMR mobility categories were negatively correlated with COVID-19 mortality. The strongest correlations were obtained by negatively time lagging mortality data, suggesting restrictions had a delayed influence. During the ‘first wave’ a model using SI (AIC 632.87) proved favorable to one using contemporaneous CMR data and SI (AIC 1193.84), or lagged CMR data and SI (AIC 642.35). Validation using ‘second wave’ data confirmed this; the model using SI solely again being optimal (RMSE: 0.2486 vs. 0.522 and 104.62). Cross-country differences were apparent in all models; Swedish data, independent of SI and CMR, proved significant throughout. There was a significant association for Sweden and the death number across models. CONCLUSION: SI may provide a broader, more accurate, representation of changes in movement in response to COVID-19 restrictions.","Sulyok, Mihály; Walker, Mark David",Travel Med Infect Dis,255,1

METHODS: This retrospective observational study was carried out at the University Hospital of Strasbourg (France) from March to April 2020. The analysed population excluded patients from intensive care units but included all other adult patients with COVID-19 who received at least one dose of lopinavir/ritonavir combination, hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin, while inpatients. Analyses were performed by using data extracted from electronic medical records. RESULT: During the study period, 278 patients were included. A rapid decrease in lopinavir/ritonavir prescriptions was observed. This was accompanied by an increase in hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin prescriptions until the end of March, followed by a decrease leading to the disappearance of these two medications in April. The pharmaceutical analysis of the prescriptions resulted in 59 PIs of which 21 were associated with lopinavir/ritonavir, 32 with hydroxychloroquine and 6 with azithromycin. Regarding the medication-related problems, the most frequent ones were incorrect treatment durations (n=32 (54.2%)), drug interactions with potential torsadogenic reactions (n=14 (23.7%)) and incorrect dosing (n=6 (10.2%)). From the 59 PIs, 48 (81.4%) were accepted and physicians adjusted the medication regimens in a timely manner.

Following an initial lack of evidence, the relatively novel data, supporting the survival benefit to severe and critical COVID-19 patients, is of limited scale. Materials and methods: This retrospective study observed medical records and disease outcomes of 200 patients with moderate, severe and critical COVID-19 receiving methylprednisolone (MP). The dose of methylprednisolone was 0.5 to 2 mg per kg in these patients. Results: Median age of presentation was 59 years. The median duration of symptoms at presentation was five days. The most common presenting symptoms were cough (77.5%), fever (67.5%) and shortness of breath (63.5%). Majority of patients (85%) presented in the first week of illness. One or more comorbidities were present in 75% of patients. Complications seen in the study cohort were cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 92 (46%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 44 (22%) and multi-organ dysfunction 17 (8.5%). The median time for initiation of corticosteroid therapy was four hours. Overall survival (OS) in patients receiving methylprednisolone was 83.5%.

However, this issue has never been fully elucidated. Based on the premise that SARS patients belonging to a given genotype group having a significantly higher SARS infection rate than others would imply that genotype group being more susceptible, we make use of a compartmental model describing disease transmission dynamics and clinical and gene data of 100 laboratory confirmed SARS patients from Chinese Han population in Taiwan to estimate the infection rates of distinct candidate genotype groups among these SARS-infected individuals. The results show that CXCL10(−938AA) is always protective whenever it appears, but appears rarely and only jointly with either Fgl2(+158T/*) or HO-1(−497A/*), while (Fgl2)(+158T/*) is associated with higher susceptibility unless combined with CXCL10/IP-10(−938AA), when jointly is associated with lower susceptibility.

Design Cross-sectional, anonymous survey Setting and Participants: 323 females aged 13-19 years recruited from clinic waiting areas at a children’s hospital. We oversampled on days when clinics serving adolescents with potential fertility compromise were scheduled. Main Outcome Measures We measured fertility desire by agreement with the statement “I want to have children someday”. To measure compromised fertility we asked “In the past year, has a doctor, nurse or other medical professional ever talked to you about the possibility that you may have decreased fertility and may not be able to have your own biological child someday?”. To measure depression severity, we used the PHQ-9 scale; scores were dichotomized into no/mild and moderate/severe. Results Mean age was 16.06±1.87 years; 57% Hispanic, 24% black; 93.5% cisgender, 6.5% transgender/gender diverse; 70% heterosexual, 30% sexual minority; 35% moderate/severe depression; 12% compromised fertility. Overall, 89% wanted children. Fewer transgender/gender diverse than cisgender participants wanted children [67% v. 93%, p <0.001] as did fewer with moderate/severe v. no/mild depression [83% v. 93%, p<0.05], while those with compromised fertility v. those without and heterosexual v. sexual minority participants had similar fertility desires.

While dysregulated or inadequate IFN responses have been associated with severe coronavirus infection, the extent to which the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 activates or antagonizes these pathways is relatively unknown. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infects patient-derived nasal epithelial cells, present at the initial site of infection; induced pluripotent stem cell-derived alveolar type 2 cells (iAT2), the major cell type infected in the lung; and cardiomyocytes (iCM), consistent with cardiovascular consequences of COVID-19 disease. Robust activation of IFN or OAS-RNase L is not observed in these cell types, whereas PKR activation is evident in iAT2 and iCM. In SARS-CoV-2–infected Calu-3 and A549(ACE2) lung-derived cell lines, IFN induction remains relatively weak; however, activation of OAS-RNase L and PKR is observed. This is in contrast to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, which effectively inhibits IFN signaling and OAS-RNase L and PKR pathways, but is similar to mutant MERS-CoV lacking innate immune antagonists. Remarkably, OAS-RNase L and PKR are activated in MAVS knockout A549(ACE2) cells, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can induce these host antiviral pathways despite minimal IFN production. Moreover, increased replication and cytopathic effect in RNASEL knockout A549(ACE2) cells implicates OAS-RNase L in restricting SARS-CoV-2. Finally, while SARS-CoV-2 fails to antagonize these host defense pathways, which contrasts with other coronaviruses, the IFN signaling response is generally weak. These host–virus interactions may contribute to the unique pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","Li, Yize; Renner, David M.; Comar, Courtney E.; Whelan, Jillian N.; Reyes, Hanako M.; Cardenas-Diaz, Fabian Leonardo; Truitt, Rachel; Tan, Li Hui; Dong, Beihua; Alysandratos, Konstantinos Dionysios; Huang, Jessie; Palmer, James N.; Adappa, Nithin D.; Kohanski, Michael A.; Kotton, Darrell N.; Silverman, Robert H.; Yang, Wenli; Morrisey, Edward E.; Cohen, Noam A.; Weiss, Susan R.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,255,5

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung failure, and fulminant pneumonia are major lung diseases in H7N9 patients. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising choice for treating virus-induced pneumonia, and was needed to treat H7N9 induced ARDS at the time. MSCs transplant into patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were conducted in a single center and open-label clinical trial. Based on the principle of voluntariness and informed consent, 44 patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were included as a control group while 17 patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were served as an experimental group with allogeneic menstrual blood-derived MSC. Notably, MSC transplantation significantly lower the mortality compared with in control group (17.6% died in MSC group vs 54.5% died in control group). Furthermore, MSC transplantation did not result in harmful effects in human body within the 5 year follow up period with 4 patients. Collectively, these results suggest that MSCs significantly improve survival rate of H7N9 induced ARDS and provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of H7N9 induced ARDS in both preclinical research and clinical studies. Because H7N9 and the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) share similar complications (such as ARDS and lung failure) and corresponding multi-organ dysfunction, MSC-based therapy could be a possible alternative for treating COVID-19.","Chen, Jiajia; Hu, Chenxia; Chen, Lijun; Tang, Lingling; Zhu, Yixin; Xu, Xiaowei; Chen, Lu; Gao, Hainv; Lu, Xiaoqing; Yu, Liang; Dai, Xiahong; Xiang, Charlie; Li, Lanjuan",Engineering (Beijing),255,1

The authors suggest that, in the setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to severe COVID-19, a ""differentiation bridge from plasmablasts to developing neutrophils"" connected these distantly related cell types. This conclusion is controversial as it appears to violate several basic principles in cell biology relating to cell lineage identity and fidelity. Correctly classifying cells and their developmental history is an important issue in cell biology and we suggest that this conclusion is not supported by the data as we show here that: (1) regressing out covariates such as unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) can lead to overfitting; and (2) that UMAP embeddings may reflect the expression of similar genes but not necessarily direct cell lineage relationships.","Alquicira-Hernandez, Jose; Powell, Joseph; Phan, Tri Giang",bioRxiv,255,29

METHODS: A nationwide ecologic study based on open-sourced, anonymized, aggregated data provided by the Israel Ministry of Health. The correlations between municipal SES, vaccination percentage, and active COVID-19 cases during the vaccination campaign were analyzed by using weighted Pearson correlations. To assess the adequacy of first dose vaccination rollout relative to the municipality COVID-19 disease burden, a metric termed the vaccination need ratio was devised by dividing the total number of active cases (per 10,000 people) by the vaccination percentage of the population over 60 in each municipality, and its correlation with the SES was examined. RESULTS: 23 days after initiation of the vaccination campaign, 760,916 (56.8%) individuals over the age of 60 were vaccinated in Israel with the first dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. A negative correlation was found between the COVID-19 active case burden and the vaccination percentage of the study population in each municipality (r=-0.47, 95% confidence interval [-0.59 to -0.30]). The vaccination percentage significantly correlated with the municipal SES (r=0.83, 95% confidence interval [0.79 to 0.87]). This finding persisted but was attenuated over a five-week period. A negative correlation between the vaccination need ratio and municipal SES (r=-0.80, 95% confidence interval [-0.88 to -0.66]) was found. CONCLUSION: Lower COVID-19 vaccination percentage was associated with lower SES and high active disease burden. Vaccination efforts should focus on areas with lower SES and high disease burden to assure equality of vaccine allocation and potentially provide a more diligent disease mitigation.","Caspi, Gil; Dayan, Avshalom; Eshal, Yael; Liverant-Taub, Sigal; Twig, Gilad; Shalit, Uri; Lewis, Yair; Shina, Avi; Caspi, Oren",Clin Microbiol Infect,255,16

We performed an initial survey of TE load and diversity in the putative ancient asexual ostracod Darwinula stevensoni. We examined long contiguous stretches of DNA in clones from a genomic fosmid library, totaling about 2.5 Mb, and supplemented these data with results on TE abundance and diversity from an Illumina draft genome. In contrast to other TE studies in putatively ancient asexuals, which revealed relatively low TE content, we found that at least 19% of the fosmid dataset and 26% of the genome assembly corresponded to known transposons. We observed a high diversity of transposon families, including LINE, gypsy, PLE, mariner/Tc, hAT, CMC, Sola2, Ginger, Merlin, Harbinger, MITEs and helitrons, with the prevalence of DNA transposons. The predominantly low levels of sequence diversity indicate that many TEs are or have recently been active. In the fosmid data, no correlation was found between telomeric repeats and non-LTR retrotransposons, which are present near telomeres in other taxa. Most TEs in the fosmid data were located outside of introns and almost none were found in exons. We also report an N-terminal Myb/SANT-like DNA-binding domain in site-specific R4/Dong non-LTR retrotransposons. Although initial results on transposable loads need to be verified with high quality draft genomes, this study provides important first insights into TE dynamics in putative ancient asexual ostracods.","Schön, Isa; Rodriguez, Fernando; Dunn, Matthew; Martens, Koen; Shribak, Michael; Arkhipova, Irina R.",Genes (Basel),255,16

The high popularity of R. adamsii coupled with poor scientific knowledge prompted the addressing of gaps related to metabolic and biomedical data of Sagan Dalya tea. The application of solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric techniques for the metabolomic study of R. adamsii leaf extracts resulted in the identification of more than 170 compounds, including carbohydrates, organic acids, simple phenol glycosides, triterpene glycosides, flavonoids, prenylated phenols, benzoic acid derivatives, hydroxycinnamates, dihydrochalcones, catechins, and procyanidins, most of which were identified for the first time in the plant. Extended surveys of the seasonal content of all detected compounds prove that specific metabolite variations reflect the bioactivity of R. adamsii extracts. Regarding in vitro methods, the expressed antioxidant potential of R. adamsii extracts was investigated via radical-scavenging, nitric oxide scavenging, and ferrous (II) ion chelating assays. The animal-based swimming to exhaustion test demonstrates the stimulating influence of R. adamsii extract on physical performance and endurance, concluding that the drug could act as an adaptogen. Thus, Sagan Dalya tea (R. adamsii) has confirmed its “old” application as a tonic remedy and requires further precise study as a novel adaptogenic plant.","Olennikov, Daniil N.; Nikolaev, Vyacheslav M.; Chirikova, Nadezhda K.",Antioxidants (Basel),255,16

This review aimed to summarize the epidemiologic traits, clinical spectrum, CT results and laboratory findings of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We scoped for relevant literatures published during 1st December 2019 to 16th July 2020 based on three databases using English and Chinese languages. We reviewed and analyzed the relevant outcomes. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic was found to have a higher transmission rate compared to SARS and MERS and involved 4 stages of evolution. The basic reproduction number (R(0)) is 3.32 (95% CI:3.24–3.39), the incubation period was 5.24 days (95% CI:3.97–6.50, 5 studies) on average, and the average time for symptoms onset varied by countries. Common clinical spectrums identified included fever (38.1–39.0 °C), cough and fatigue, with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) being the most common complication reported. Body temperatures above 39.0 °C, dyspnea, and anorexia were more common symptoms in severe patients. Aged over 65 years old, having co-morbidities, and developing complications were the commonest high-risk factors associated with severe conditions. Leucopenia and lymphopenia were the most common signs of infection while liver and kidney damage were rare but may cause bad outcomes for patients. The bilateral, multifocal Ground-Glass Opacification (GGO) on peripheral, and the consolidative pulmonary opacity were the most frequent CT results and the tendency of mortality rates differed by region. CONCLUSIONS: We provided a bird’s-eye view of the COVID-19 during the current pandemic, which will help better understanding the key traits of the disease. The findings could be used for disease’s future research, control and prevention.","Xie, Yewei; Wang, Zaisheng; Liao, Huipeng; Marley, Gifty; Wu, Dan; Tang, Weiming",BMC Infect Dis,255,1

At the time of writing this paper no medical therapy is officially recommended or has shown results in improving the outcomes in COVID-19 patients. With the aim of diminishing the impact in Hospital admissions and reducing the number of medical complications, we implemented a strategy based on a Hospital Home-Care Unit (HHCU) using an easy-to-use treatment based on an oral administration regimen outside the hospital with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plus azithromycin (AZM) for a short period of 5 days. Patients and methods: Patients [≥] 18 years old visiting the emergency room at the Hospital Universitario San Pedro de Logrono (La Rioja) between March, 31st and April, 12th diagnosed with COVID-19 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by a specific PCR, as follows: Patients with pneumonia (CURB [≤] 1) who did not present severe comorbidities and had no processes that contraindicated this therapeutic regime. Olygosimptomatic patients without pneumonia aged [≥] 55 years. Patients [≥] 18 years old without pneumonia with significant comorbidities. We excluded patients with known allergies to some of the antimicrobials used and patients treated with other drugs that increase the QTc or with QTc >450msc. The therapeutic regime was: HCQ 400 mg every twice in a loading dose followed by 200 mg twice for 5 days, plus AZM 500 mg on the first day followed by 250 mg daily for 5 days. A daily telephone follow-up was carried out from the hospital by the same physician. The end-points of our study were: 1.- To measure the need for hospital admission within 15 days after the start of treatment. 2.- To measure the need to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) within 15 days after the start of the treatment. 3.- To describe the severity of the clinical complications developed. 4.- To measure the mortality within 30 days after starting treatment (differentiating if the cause is COVID-19 or something else). 5.-To describe the safety and adverse effects of the therapeutic regime. Results: During the 13 days studied a total of 502 patients were attended in the emergency room due to COVID-19. Forty-two were sent at home; 80 were attended by the HHCU (patients on this study) and 380 were admitted to the Hospital. In our series there were a group of 69 (85.18%) patients diagnosed with pneumonia (37 males and 32 females). Most of them, 57 (82.60%) had a CURB65 score of <1 (average age 49) and 12 (17.40%) a CURB score of 1 (average age 63). Eighteen (22.50%) of the pneumonia patients also had some morbidity as a risk factor. 11 patients (13.75%) without pneumonia were admitted to the HHCU because comorbidities or age [≥] 55 years. Six patients with pneumonia had to be hospitalized during the observation period, 3 of them because side effects and 3 because of worsening. One of these patients, with morbid obesity and asthma, had clinical worsening needing mechanical ventilation at ICU and developed acute distress respiratory syndrome. With the exception of the patient admitted to the ICU, the rest of the patients were discharged at home in the following 8 days (3 to 8 days). Twelve patients (15%), 11 of whom had pneumonia, experienced side effects affecting mainly the digestive. In another patient a QTc interval prolongation (452 msc) was observed. In total 3 of these patients had to be admitted in the Hospital, 2 because of vomiting and 1 because a QTc interval lengthening. None of the patients needed to stop the HCQ or AZM and all the 80 patients finished the therapeutic strategy. From the group without pneumonia only a patient developed diarrhea that did not require hospitalization or stop the medication. Conclusions: Our strategy has been associated with a reduction in the burden of hospital pressure, and it seems to be successful in terms of the number of patients who have developed serious complications and / or death. None of the patients died in the studied period and only 6 have to be admitted in conventional hospitalization area.","Oteo, J.

Cyclophilins, a family of host peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), play a pivotal role in the life cycles of many viruses and therefore represent an attractive target for broad-spectrum antiviral development. We report here the pangenotypic anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity of a small-molecule cyclophilin inhibitor (SMCypI). Mechanistic and modeling studies revealed that the SMCypI bound to cyclophilin A in competition with cyclosporine (CsA), inhibited its PPIase activity, and disrupted the CypA-nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) interaction. Resistance selection showed that the lead SMCypI hardly selected amino acid substitutions conferring low-level or no resistance in vitro. Interestingly, the SMCypI selected D320E and Y321H substitutions, located in domain II of the NS5A protein. These substitutions were previously associated with low-level resistance to cyclophilin inhibitors such as alisporivir. Finally, the SMCypI inhibited the replication of other members of the Flaviviridae family with higher 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) than for HCV. Thus, because of its chemical plasticity and simplicity of synthesis, our new family of SMCypIs represents a promising new class of drugs with the potential for broad-spectrum anti-Flaviviridae activity as well as an invaluable tool to explore the role of cyclophilins in viral life cycles.","Nevers, Quentin; Ruiz, Isaac; Ahnou, Nazim; Donati, Flora; Brillet, Rozenn; Softic, Laurent; Chazal, Maxime; Jouvenet, Nolwenn; Fourati, Slim; Baudesson, Camille; Bruscella, Patrice; Gelin, Muriel; Guichou, Jean-François; Pawlotsky, Jean-Michel; Ahmed-Belkacem, Abdelhakim",Antimicrob Agents Chemother,255,1

Following the first COVID‐19 wave, we estimated the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) among blood donors across Canada. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This serial cross‐sectional study was conducted between May 9 and July 21, 2020 from blood donors donating at all Canadian Blood Services locations. We used the Abbott Architect assay to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG antibodies from retention plasma. Seroprevalence was standardized to population‐level demographics and assay characteristics were adjusted using the Rogan‐Gladen equation. Results were stratified by region, age, ethnicity, ABO groups, and quantiles of material and social deprivation indices. Temporal trends were evaluated at 2‐week intervals. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression compared SARS‐CoV‐2 reactive to non‐reactive donors by sociodemographic variables. RESULTS: Overall 552/74642 donors, had detectable antibodies, adjusted seroprevalence was 7.0/1000 donors (95% CI; 6.3, 7.6). Prevalence was differential by geography, Ontario had the highest rate, 8.8/1000 donors (7.8, 9.8), compared to the Atlantic region 4.5/1000 donors (2.6, 6.4); adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.2 (1.5, 3.3). Donors that self‐identified as an ethnic minority were more likely than white donors to be sero‐reactive aOR 1.5 (1.2, 1.9). No temporal trends were observed. DISCUSSION: Worldwide, blood services have leveraged their operational capacity to inform public health. While >99% of Canadians did not show humoral evidence of past infection, we found regional variability and disparities by ethnicity. Seroprevalence studies will continue to play a pivotal role in evaluating public health policies by identifying trends and monitor disparities.","Saeed, Sahar; Drews, Steven J.; Pambrun, Chantale; Yi, Qi‐Long; Osmond, Lori; O'Brien, Sheila F.",Transfusion,255,1

Recent research suggests that decreasing the intensity of MV using lung protective ventilation (LPV) with lower tidal volume (Vt) and driving pressure (∆P) could improve survival. Extra-corporal CO(2) removal (ECCO(2)R) precisely enables LPV by allowing lower Vt, ∆P and mechanical power while maintaining PaCO(2) within a physiologic range. This study evaluates the potential cost-effectiveness of ECCO(2)R-enabled LPV in France. METHODS: We modelled the distribution over time of ventilated ARDS patients across 3 health-states (alive & ventilated, alive & weaned from ventilation, dead). We compared the outcomes of 3 strategies: MV (no ECCO(2)R), LPV (ECCO(2)R when PaCO(2) > 55 mmHg) and Ultra-LPV (ECCO(2)R for all). Patients characteristics, ventilation settings, survival and lengths of stay were derived from a large ARDS epidemiology study. Survival benefits associated with lower ∆P were taken from the analysis of more than 3000 patients enrolled in 9 randomized trials. Health outcomes were expressed in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were computed with both Day 60 cost and Lifetime cost. RESULTS: Both LPV and ULPV as enabled by ECCO2R provided favorable results at Day 60 as compared to MV. Survival rates were increased with the protective strategies, notably with ULPV that provided even more manifest benefits as compared to MV. LPV and ULPV produced +0.162 and + 0.627 incremental QALYs as compared to MV, respectively. LPV and ULPV costs were augmented because of their survival benefits. Nonetheless, ICERs of LPV and ULPV vs. MV were all well below the €50,000 threshold. ULPV also presented with favorable ICERs as compared to LPV (i.e. less than €25,000/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: ECCO(2)R-enabled LPV strategies might provide cost-effective survival benefit. Additional data from interventional and observational studies are needed to support this preliminary model-based analysis.","Ethgen, Oliver; Goldstein, Jacques; Harenski, Kai; Mekontso Dessap, Armand; Morimont, Philippe; Quintel, Michael; Combes, Alain",J Crit Care,255,30

A major limitation of sequence homology-based identification for highly divergent microorganisms is the short length of reads generated by most highly parallel sequencing technologies. Short reads require a high level of sequence similarities to annotated genes to confidently predict gene function or homology. Such recognition of highly divergent homologues can be improved by reference-free (de novo) assembly of short overlapping sequence reads into larger contigs. We describe an ensemble strategy that integrates the sequential use of various de Bruijn graph and overlap-layout-consensus assemblers with a novel partitioned sub-assembly approach. We also proposed new quality metrics that are suitable for evaluating metagenome de novo assembly. We demonstrate that this new ensemble strategy tested using in silico spike-in, clinical and environmental NGS datasets achieved significantly better contigs than current approaches.","Deng, Xutao; Naccache, Samia N.; Ng, Terry; Federman, Scot; Li, Linlin; Chiu, Charles Y.; Delwart, Eric L.",Nucleic Acids Res,255,15

OBJECTIVE: To describe the association between asthma diagnosis and endotype and clinical outcomes among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Retrospective multicenter cohort study of outpatients and inpatients presenting to six hospitals in the Mount Sinai Health System New York metropolitan region between March 7 th to June 7 th , 2020, with COVID-19 infection, with and without a history of asthma. The primary outcome assessed was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and hospital length of stay. Outcomes were compared in patients with or without asthma using a multivariate Cox regression model. Outcomes stratified by blood eosinophilia count were also assessed. RESULTS: Of 10,523 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, 4902 patients were hospitalized, and 468 had a diagnosis of asthma (4.4%). When adjusted for COVID-19 disease severity, comorbidities, and concurrent therapies, patients with asthma had a lower mortality [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.64 (0.53-0.77), p<0.001] and a lower rate of hospitalization and ICU admission [OR 0.43 (0.28-0.64) p<0.001 and OR 0.51 (0.41-0.64), p<0.001 respectively]. Those with blood eosinophils ≥200 cells/μL, both with and without asthma, had lower mortality. CONCLUSION: Patients with asthma may be at a reduced risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19 infection. Eosinophilia, both in those with and without asthma, may be associated with reduced mortality risk.","Ho, Kam Sing; Howell, Daniel; Rogers, Linda; Narasimhan, Bharat; Verma, Hannah; Steiger, David",Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol,255,26

This project was conducted to determine whether negative-pressure isolation for multiple patients can be achieved quickly and effectively using general hospital space not previously dedicated to respiratory isolation. METHODS: The physical therapy gymnasium was the area designated to test the ability to create a negative-pressure isolation environment in a large space. The conversion was planned in advance of an unscheduled drill to convert the space. Four high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtered forced air machines were used to generate negative pressure. The units were vented to the outside air by a 25-foot length of 10-inch-diameter reusable duct. We evaluated the time needed for equipment setup and room conversion and noted any subjective difficulty with either setup or operation of the equipment. We measured the ability of the equipment to generate a negative air pressure relative to adjacent areas and determined the noise levels created during the use of different combinations of machines at various power settings. RESULTS: After drill activation and the request for equipment setup, 1 hour was required to convert the physical therapy gymnasium into an operational negative-pressure environment. The room pressure readings “high” power ranged from −1.5 to −13 Pa (−0.006 to −0.052 inches of water), and noise levels ranged from 70 to 76 dB. Calculated air changes per hour using 1, 2, 3, or 4 units running simultaneously at “high” power were 4.1, 8.2, 12.3, and 16.4, respectively. Using 4 units at once running at “low” power setting yielded 8.2 air changes per hour and generated a room pressure reading of −8.0 Pa, or −0.032 inches of water. CONCLUSION: Portable HEPA filtered forced air units are an effective means of creating large patient care areas with the negative-pressure environment required for respiratory isolation. This design results in a significantly lower-cost alternative compared with construction of individual rooms or units with similar capability and can be retrofitted to existing space. This type of unit would allow treatment of many more patients than current hospital capability would permit and would be an important asset in meeting the needs created by bioterrorism or a naturally occurring epidemic.","Rosenbaum, Robert A.; Benyo, Jeffrey S.; O'Connor, Robert E.; Passarello, Brent A.; Williams, Daniel R.; Humphrey, Brian D.; Ross, Robert W.; Berry, James M.; Krebs, Jeffrey G.",Ann Emerg Med,255,24

METHODS: The participants were 289 university students ranging in age, income, and ethnic backgrounds. They were presented with scenarios describing avian flu outbreaks affecting their community. They reported their anticipated emotional responses (positive emotion, negative emotion) and behavioral responses (helping, avoidance, sacrifice, illegal behavior) as if the scenarios were actually occurring. They also were assessed on individual differences expected to predict their responses. RESULTS: Participants were only modestly familiar with the avian flu and anticipated strong emotional and behavioral responses to an outbreak. Path analyses were conducted to test a model for predicting responses. The model showed that age, sex, income, spirituality, resilience, and neuroticism were related to responses. Spirituality, resilience, and income predicted better emotional responses, and neuroticism and female sex predicted worse emotional responses. Age, sex, income, and spirituality had direct effects on behavior. The emotional responses were directly related to each behavior and mediated the effects of individual differences.

By employing this method, we learnt an individual’s behavioral routine preferences. We then analyzed daily routines for an individual and for eight smart home residents grouped by health diagnoses. We observed that the behavioral routine preferences changed over time. Specifically, the probability that the observed behavior was the same at the beginning of data collection as it was at the end (months later) was lower for residents experiencing cognitive decline than for cognitively healthy residents. When comparing aggregated behavior between groups of residents from the two diagnosis groups, the behavioral difference was even greater. Furthermore, the behavior preferences were used by a random forest classifier to predict a resident’s cognitive health diagnosis, with an accuracy of 0.84.","Lin, Beiyu; Cook, Diane J.",Sensors (Basel),255,20

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been recommended to treat critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) patients in a few reviews, but the clinical study evidence on its efficacy in COVID‐19 patients was lacking. METHODS: 325 patients with laboratory‐confirmed critical COVID‐19 were enrolled from 4 government‐designated COVID‐19 treatment centres in southern China from December 2019 to March 2020. The primary outcomes were 28‐ and 60‐day mortality, and the secondary outcomes were the total length of in‐hospital and the total duration of the disease. Subgroup analysis was carried out according to clinical classification of COVID‐19, IVIG dosage and timing. RESULTS: In the enrolled 325 patients, 174 cases used IVIG and 151 cases did not. The 28‐day mortality was improved with IVIG after adjusting confounding in overall cohort (P = 0.0014), and the in‐hospital and the total duration of disease were longer in the IVIG group (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that only in patients with critical type, IVIG could significantly reduce the 28‐day mortality, decrease the inflammatory response and improve some organ functions (all P < 0.05); the application of IVIG in the early stage (admission ≤ 7 days) with a high dose (> 15 g per day) exhibited significant reduction in 60‐day mortality in the critical‐type patients.

Methods: Herein, we compare several analytic platforms with 15 positive and 30 negative SARS-CoV-2 infected controls followed by viral neutralization assessment. We then applied these platforms in a clinically relevant population: 114 individuals with unknown histories of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: In control populations, the best performing antibody detection assays were SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG (specificity 87%, sensitivity 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 93%), spike IgG3 (specificity 93%, sensitivity 97%, PPV 93%, NPV 97%), and nucleocapsid (NP) protein IgG (specificity 93%, sensitivity 97%, PPV 93%, NPV 97%). Neutralization of positive and negative control sera showed 100% agreement. 20 unknown individuals had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with 16 demonstrating virus neutralization. The antibody assays that best predicted virus neutralization were RBD IgG (misidentified 2), spike IgG3 (misidentified 1), and NP IgG (misidentified 2). Conclusion: These data suggest that meaningful evaluation of antibody assay performance requires testing in an unknown population. Further, these results indicate coupling of virus neutralization analysis to a positive antibody test is required to categorize patients based on SARS-CoV-2 immune protection status following virus exposure or vaccine administration. One of the antibody detection platforms identified in this study followed by the pseudoneutralization or focus reduction assay would provide a practical testing strategy to assess for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with optimal prediction of correlates to neutralizing immunity.","Rathe, J.

Methods: There were 28,544 EHCPs who received their first dose of COVID-19 vaccines between December 15, 2020, and March 8, 2021. The EHCPs self-reported adverse reactions to a centralized COVID-19 command center (CCC). The CCC screened and collected information on the quality of reaction, symptoms, and timing of the onset of the reaction. Results: Of 1253 calls to the CCC, 113 were identified as requiring consideration by a panel of three (American Board of Allergy and Immunology) ABAI-certified allergists for future dosing or formal in-person assessment. Of the 113 EHCPs, 94 (83.2%) were recommended to get their second dose. Eighty of 94 received their second planned dose without a severe or immediate reaction. Of the 14 of 113 identified as needing further evaluation, 6 were evaluated by a physician and subsequently received their second dose without a serious adverse reaction. Eight of 14 did not receive their second dose. Only 5 of the 113 EHCPs reported reactions (4.4%) were recommended to not take the second dose: 3 (2.6%) because of symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis, and 2 because of neurologic complications (seizure, stroke). Conclusion: The panel demonstrated that, by consideration of reaction history alone, the ECHPs could be appropriately triaged to receive scheduled second dosing of COVID-19 vaccines without delays for in-person evaluation and allergy testing.","Arroliga, Mercedes E; Dhanani, Karim; Arroliga, Alejandro C; Huddleston, Penny S; Trahan, Jason; Aguilar, Toni; Weldon, David",Allergy Asthma Proc,255,20

Protective behaviors such as social distancing and mask-wearing have been shown effective at curbing infection rates. These practices are subject to individual perceptions of risk and responsibility. This study aimed to characterize the risk perceptions and protective behaviors of residents in a rural central Michigan region. Specifically, we examined whether individual risk status predicted protective behaviors and concern about the pandemic. METHODS: Participants were identified via medical records at participating clinics. The high-risk group was those with conditions that put them at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and was compared to healthy controls. Data were collected via phone survey. Participants were asked about their protective behaviors and level of concern about the ongoing pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients participated in the survey; 73 were high-risk acknowledgers, 29 were high-risk deniers, and 48 were healthy controls. There was no significant difference between the groups on level of concern regarding the pandemic or protective behaviors (P > .05). Compared to other comorbidities, obese people were significantly more likely to deny their risk (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, high risk, whether acknowledged or denied, did not appear to significantly impact behaviors or concern. The high percentage of those at high risk who did not acknowledge this suggests many factors including a potential lack of patient education regarding their comorbidities, specifically, how their illness increases their risk of severe illness from COVID-19.","Greathouse, Frances R.; Nagia, Sally T.; Rayyan, Morsi S.; Bailey, Beth A.",J Prim Care Community Health,255,22

Materials and methods All imaging departments in the UK were contacted and asked about the provision of home reporting and IT support before and after the first wave of the pandemic. Results One hundred and thirty-seven of the 217 departments contacted replied, producing a response rate of 61%. There was a 147% increase in the provision of remote access viewing and reporting platforms during the pandemic. Although 578 consultants had access to a viewing platform pre-pandemic, this had increased to 1,431 during the course of the first wave. Conclusion This survey represents work undertaken by UK NHS Trusts in co-ordinating and providing increased home-reporting facilities to UK radiologists during the first wave of this global pandemic. The impact of these facilities has been shown to allow more than just the provision of reporting of both elective and emergency imaging and provides additional flexibility in how UK radiologists can help support and provide services. This is a good start, but there are potential problems that now need to be overcome.","Callaway, M.; Greenhalgh, R.; Harden, S.; Elford, J.; Drinkwater, K.; Vanburen, T.; Ramsden, W.",Clin Radiol,255,1

METHODS: The TB incidence from January 2006 to December 2017 was obtained, and then the time series was partitioned into training subsamples (from January 2006 to December 2016) and testing subsamples (from January to December 2017). Among them, the training set was used to develop the EEMD-SARIMA-NARNN combined model, whereas the testing set was used to validate the forecasting performance of the model. Whilst the forecasting accuracy level of this novel method was compared with the basic SARIMA model, basic NARNN model, error-trend-seasonal (ETS) model, and traditional SARIMA-NARNN mixture model. RESULTS: By comparing the accuracy level of the forecasting measurements including root-mean-square error, mean absolute deviation, mean error rate, mean absolute percentage error, and root-mean-square percentage error, it was shown that the EEMD-SARIMA-NARNN combined method produced lower error rates than the others. The descriptive statistics suggested that TB was a seasonal disease, peaking in late winter and early spring and a trough in autumn and early winter, and the TB epidemic indicated a drastic increase by a factor of 1.7 from 2006 to 2017 in Tibet, with average annual percentage change of 5.8 (95% confidence intervals: 3.5–8.1). CONCLUSION: This novel data-driven hybrid method can better consider both linear and nonlinear components in the TB incidence than the others used in this study, which is of great help to estimate and forecast the future epidemic trends of TB in Tibet. Besides, under present trends, strict precautionary measures are required to reduce the spread of TB in Tibet.","Li, Jizhen; Li, Yuhong; Ye, Ming; Yao, Sanqiao; Yu, Chongchong; Wang, Lei; Wu, Weidong; Wang, Yongbin",Infect Drug Resist,255,16

For dental practices and hospitals in countries/regions that are (potentially) affected with COVID-19, strict and effective infection control protocols are urgently needed. AIM AND OBJECTIVE: To investigate knowledge and perception of COVID-19 among pedodontists in India. POPULATION AND METHODS: A quick online cross-sectional study was conducted among 335 pedodontists in India. The questionnaire was sent to 410 pedodontists in India, out of those 335 responded. The study objective and questionnaire were sent to pedodontists via “Google Forms”. The collected data were sent for appropriate statistics. RESULTS: Of the total participants, 82% of pedodontists think that children are silent carriers of COVID-19. Sixty-two percent of pedodontists say that it is very difficult to treat pediatric dental patients by use of a personal protective equipment (PPE) kit. Sixty-four percent of pedodontists will overcome this financial crisis by increasing working time and 36% of them by increasing the cost of treatment.

However, little is currently known about the potential for pre-existing resistance to RDV and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversification that might impact RDV efficacy as the virus continue to spread globally. In this study, >90,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from globally circulating clinical isolates, including sequences from recently emerged United Kingdom and South Africa variants, and >300 from mink isolates were analyzed for genetic diversity in the RNA replication complex (nsp7, nsp8, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14) with a focus on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the molecular target of RDV. Overall, low genetic variation was observed with only 12 amino acid substitutions present in the entire RNA replication complex in [â¥]0.5% of analyzed sequences with the highest overall frequency (82.2%) observed for nsp12 P323L that consistently increased over time. Low sequence variation in the RNA replication complex was also observed among the mink isolates. Importantly, the coronavirus Nsp12 mutations previously selected in vitro in the presence of RDV were identified in only 2 isolates (0.002%) within all the analyzed sequences. In addition, among the sequence variants observed in [â¥]0.5% clinical isolates, including P323L, none were located near the established polymerase active site or sites critical for the RDV mechanism of inhibition. In summary, the low diversity and high genetic stability of the RNA replication complex observed over time and in the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants suggests a minimal global risk of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 resistance to RDV.","Martin, Ross; Li, Jiani; Parvangada, Aiyappa; Perry, Jason K; Cihlar, Tomas; Mo, Hongmei; Porter, Danielle P; Svarovskaia, Evguenia S",bioRxiv,255,26

The CSC adopted by US states ration intensive care unit (ICU) admission using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, which is used to compare expected in-hospital mortality among eligible patients. However, it is unknown if Black and White patients with equivalent SOFA scores have equivalent in-hospital mortality. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether reliance on SOFA is associated with bias against Black patients in CSC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted using data from the eICU Collaborative Research Database of patients admitted to 233 US ICUs in 2014 to 2015. Included individuals were Black and White adult patients in the ICU, who were followed up to hospital discharge. Data were analyzed from May 2020 through April 2021. EXPOSURE: SOFA scores at ICU admission. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hierarchical logistic regression with hospital fixed effects was used to measure the interaction between race and SOFA as a factor associated with in-hospital mortality, as well as the odds of death among Black and White patients with equivalent priority for resource allocation according to the SOFA-based ranking rules of 3 statewide CSC (denoted A, B, and C) under shortage conditions that were severe (ie, only patients with the highest priority would be eligible for allocation), intermediate (ie, patients in the highest 2 tiers would be eligible for allocation), or low (ie, only patients with the lowest priority would be at risk of exclusion). RESULTS: Among 111 885 ICU encounters representing 95 549 patients, there were 16 688 encounters with Black patients (14.9%) and 51 464 (46.0%) encounters with women and the mean (SD) age was 63.3 (16.9) years. The median (interquartile range) SOFA score was not statistically significantly different between Black and White patients (4 [2-6] for both groups; P = .19), but mortality was lower among Black individuals compared with White individuals with equivalent SOFA scores (odds ratio [OR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99; P < .001). This was associated with lower mortality among Black patients compared with White patients prioritized for resource allocation in 3 CSC under shortage conditions that were severe (system A: OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.58-0.74; P < .001; system B: OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.64-0.78; P < .001; system C: OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.67-0.80; P < .001), intermediate (system A: OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.67-0.80; P < .001; system B: OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.77-0.89; P < .001; system C: OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.77-0.89; P < .001), and low (system A: OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.77-0.89; P < .001; system C: OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81-0.92; P < .001; not applicable for system B, which had fewer tiers). When SOFA-based ranking rules were adjusted for Black patients to simulate equitable allocation based on observed mortality, the proportion upgraded to higher priority ranged from 379 Black patient encounters (2.3%) in low shortage conditions to 2601 Black patient encounters (15.6%) in severe shortage conditions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that SOFA scores were associated with overestimated mortality among Black patients compared with White patients, and this was associated with a structural disadvantage for Black patients in CSC allocation systems. These findings suggest that guidelines should be revised to correct this inequity and alternative methods should be developed for more equitable triage.","Miller, William Dwight; Han, Xuan; Peek, Monica E.; Charan Ashana, Deepshikha; Parker, William F.",JAMA Netw Open,255,1

OBJECTIVE: This research aims to develop a deep learning methodology for automated differentiation of tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis based on routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 146 patients who underwent radiation therapy after glioma resection and presented with suspected recurrent lesions at the follow-up MRI examination were selected for analysis. Routine MRI scans were acquired from each patient, including T1, T2, and gadolinium-contrast-enhanced T1 sequences. Of those cases, 96 (65.8%) were confirmed as glioma recurrence on postsurgical pathological examination, while 50 (34.2%) were diagnosed as necrosis. A light-weighted deep neural network (DNN) (ie, efficient radionecrosis neural network [ERN-Net]) was proposed to learn radiological features of gliomas and necrosis from MRI scans. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate performance of the model in both image-wise and subject-wise classifications. Preoperative diagnostic performance of the model was also compared to that of the state-of-the-art DNN models and five experienced neurosurgeons. RESULTS: DNN models based on multimodal MRI outperformed single-modal models. ERN-Net achieved the highest AUC in both image-wise (0.915) and subject-wise (0.958) classification tasks. The evaluated DNN models achieved an average sensitivity of 0.947 (SD 0.033), specificity of 0.817 (SD 0.075), and accuracy of 0.903 (SD 0.026), which were significantly better than the tested neurosurgeons (P=.02 in sensitivity and P<.001 in specificity and accuracy). CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning offers a useful computational tool for the differential diagnosis between recurrent gliomas and necrosis. The proposed ERN-Net model, a simple and effective DNN model, achieved excellent performance on routine MRI scans and showed a high clinical applicability.","Gao, Yang; Xiao, Xiong; Han, Bangcheng; Li, Guilin; Ning, Xiaolin; Wang, Defeng; Cai, Weidong; Kikinis, Ron; Berkovsky, Shlomo; Di Ieva, Antonio; Zhang, Liwei; Ji, Nan; Liu, Sidong",JMIR Med Inform,255,1

Additionally, Acanthamoeba may serve as an incubator-like reservoir for microorganisms, including those that are pathogenic to humans, where the microorganisms use amoebae’s defences to resist harsh environment and evade host defences and drugs, whilst growing in numbers inside the amoebae. Furthermore, amoebae can also be used as a “genetic melting pot” where exchange of genes as well as adaptation of microorganisms, leading to higher pathogenicity, may arise. Here, we describe bacteria, fungi and viruses that are known to interact with Acanthamoeba spp.","Mungroo, Mohammad Ridwane; Siddiqui, Ruqaiyyah; Khan, Naveed Ahmed",Folia Microbiol (Praha),255,1

This scoring system has been translated into other languages. Given the lack of an Italian version of the OES, the present study was designed to establish, culturally adapt, and validate the Italian version. METHODS: The OES questionnaire was culturally adapted to Italian patients in accordance with the literature guidelines with a pilot phase including seven patients with elbow problems and seven healthy subjects. The study includes 110 participants from three hospitals, who underwent elbow surgery for acute (70%) or chronic diseases. At least one month after elbow surgery, at the “index visit”, the physician completed the Mayo Elbow Performance Index and patients completed the following questionnaires: the Italian OES, the shortened version of the Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire (QuickDASH) and the Short-Form 36 Health Survey. Internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha. Reproducibility was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient in ten patients who completed the OES again two-three days after the index visit. Construct validity was assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients. Responsiveness was evaluated in 68 patients who answered the questionnaires four months after the index visit, using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the effect size and the standardized response mean calculation. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha was excellent: 0.86 (0.82-0.90) for OES pain, 0.92 (0.90-0.94) for OES function, and 0.90 (0.87-0.93) for OES social/psychological. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.94 (0.78-0.98) for OES pain, 0.91 (0.71-0.97) for OES function, 0.95 (0.83-0.98) for OES social-psychological and 0.93 (0.76-0.98) for OES total. The Spearman ρ was >0.7 for OES pain and QuickDASH, for OES function and both QuickDASH and Mayo Elbow Performance Index, and for OES social-psychological and QuickDASH. Regarding responsiveness, the mean of the changes between the two visits ranged from 33.9 for OES pain, to 44 points for OES function and OES social/psychological. The effect size and the standardized response mean were >0.8 for all OES domains. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the Italian version of the OES, translated in accordance with the international standardized guidelines, is reliable, valid, and responsive in patients who have undergone elbow surgery.","Padovani, Sara; Capuzzo, Maurizia; Massari, Leo; Caruso, Gaetano; Arrigoni, Paolo; Zaolino, Carlo; Cucchi, Davide; Valpiani, Giorgia; Colozza, Alessandra",JSES Int,255,1

However, the fate and status of SARS-CoV-2 in soil and the possible risks for human health through contaminated food are unknown. Therefore, this perspective paper discusses the challenges of determining the SARS-CoV-2 in soil and the mechanisms concerning its adsorption, movement, and infectivity in soil, considering what has already been reported by perspective papers published up to May 2021. These issues are discussed, drawing attention to the soil virus bibliography and considering the chemical structure of the virus. The mechanistic understanding of the status and behavior of SARS-CoV-2 in soil requires setting up an accurate determination method. In addition, future researches should provide insights into i) plant uptake and movement inside the plant, ii) virus adsorption and desorption in soil with the relative infectivity, and iii) its effects on soil functions. Models should simulate spatial localization of virus in the soil matrix.","Pietramellara, Giacomo; Imran Pathan, Shamina; Datta, Rahul; Vranová, Valerie; Ceccherini, MariaTeresa; Nannipieri, Paolo",Saudi J Biol Sci,255,32

This population appears to be at higher risk for critical illness due to comorbidities and chronic immunosuppressive state Methods This was a single-center, retrospective study of 7 lung-transplant recipients who were symptomatic and tested positive for COVID-19 between Feb 2020 and Oct 2020. Demographics, including single vs double lung transplantation, time from transplant were included. Laboratory data on admission, immunosuppressive regimen and adjustment during hospitalization, oxygen requirements and outcomes were also collected Results To date, 7 out of 227 post-lung transplant patients followed at our center became symptomatic with COVID-19 infection. The average age was 60.5 years and 70% were female. All patients had double lung transplantation performed between Apr 2010 and Nov 2019. The average body mass index was 27.0 kg/m2. 85% required hospitalization, three had to be admitted to the intensive care unit, two required invasive mechanical ventilation. Two patients died (one due to acute kidney injury and refractory shock and one refused intubation). One patient on mechanical ventilation required VV ECMO 3 days after admission as a bridge to recovery. All patients were on standard triple immunosuppressive regimen [tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone]. Mycophenolate was stopped for all patients at the time of the infection, and those who required oxygen supplementation (n=5) received dexamethasone and convalescent plasma. Two of them were not eligible for Remdesivir. Elevated d-dimer (0.78 - 5.57 mg/L), LDH (253 - 985 U/L) and the degree of hypoxemia on admission correlated to worse outcomes Conclusion COVID-19 infection in lung transplant patients has a variable course. In our study, d-dimer, LDH and the degree of hypoxemia on admission had a linear correlation with unfavorable outcome, similar to what has been reported for non lung-transplant patients with COVID-19. Intubation and mechanical ventilation portend a poor prognosis. In our cohort reduction in net immunosuppression (stopping anti-metabolite) and supportive treatment was utilized.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the first viral pathogen confirmed to be widely transmissible in animal food. Because the potential for viral contamination in animal food is not well characterized, the objectives of this study were to 1) observe the magnitude of virus contamination in an animal food manufacturing facility, and 2) investigate a proposed method, feed sequencing, to decrease virus decontamination on animal food-contact surfaces. A U.S. virulent PEDV isolate was used to inoculate 50 kg swine feed, which was mixed, conveyed, and discharged into bags using pilot-scale feed manufacturing equipment. Surfaces were swabbed and analyzed for the presence of PEDV RNA by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Environmental swabs indicated complete contamination of animal food-contact surfaces (0/40 vs. 48/48, positive baseline samples/total baseline samples, positive subsequent samples/total subsequent samples, respectively; P < 0.05) and near complete contamination of non-animal food-contact surfaces (0/24 vs. 16/18, positive baseline samples/total baseline samples, positive subsequent samples/total subsequent samples, respectively; P < 0.05). Flushing animal food-contact surfaces with low-risk feed is commonly used to reduce cross-contamination in animal feed manufacturing. Thus, four subsequent 50 kg batches of virus-free swine feed were manufactured using the same system to test its impact on decontaminating animal food-contact surfaces. Even after 4 subsequent sequences, animal food-contact surfaces retained viral RNA (28/33 positive samples/total samples), with conveying system being more contaminated than the mixer. A bioassay to test infectivity of dust from animal food-contact surfaces failed to produce infectivity. This study demonstrates the potential widespread viral contamination of surfaces in an animal food manufacturing facility and the difficulty of removing contamination using conventional feed sequencing, which underscores the importance for preventing viruses from entering and contaminating such facilities.","Schumacher, Loni L.; Huss, Anne R.; Cochrane, Roger A.; Stark, Charles R.; Woodworth, Jason C.; Bai, Jianfa; Poulsen, Elizabeth G.; Chen, Qi; Main, Rodger G.; Zhang, Jianqiang; Gauger, Phillip C.; Ramirez, Alejandro; Derscheid, Rachel J.; Magstadt, Drew M.; Dritz, Steve S.; Jones, Cassandra K.",PLoS One,255,20

Given the constant rise in bacterial resistance to antibiotics, treatment failure is increasingly frequent. In this context, innovative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Stimulation of innate immune cells in the respiratory tract [via activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs)] is an attractive approach for rapidly activating the body's immune defenses against a broad spectrum of microorganisms. Previous studies of the TLR5 agonist flagellin in animal models showed that standalone TLR stimulation does not result in the effective treatment of pneumococcal respiratory infection but does significantly improve the therapeutic outcome of concomitant antibiotic treatment. Here, we investigated the antibacterial interaction between antibiotic and intranasal flagellin in a mouse model of pneumococcal respiratory infection. Using various doses of orally administered amoxicillin or systemically administered cotrimoxazole, we found that the intranasal instillation of flagellin (a dose that promotes maximal lung pro-inflammatory responses) induces synergistic rather than additive antibacterial effects against antibiotic–susceptible pneumococcus. We next set up a model of infection with pneumococcus that is resistant to multiple antibiotics in the context of influenza superinfection. Remarkably, the combination of amoxicillin and flagellin effectively treated superinfection with the amoxicillin-resistant pneumococcus since the bacterial clearance was increased by more than 100-fold compared to standalone treatments. Our results also showed that, in response to flagellin, the lung tissue generated an innate immune response even though it had been damaged by the influenza virus and pneumococcal infections. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the selective boosting of lung innate immunity is a conceptually advantageous approach for improving the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment and fighting antibiotic-resistant bacteria.","Matarazzo, Laura; Casilag, Fiordiligie; Porte, Rémi; Wallet, Frederic; Cayet, Delphine; Faveeuw, Christelle; Carnoy, Christophe; Sirard, Jean-Claude",Front Immunol,255,20

Successful health policy implementation relies on early identification of infected individuals and extensive contact tracing. However, rural communities, where resources for testing are sparse or simply absent, face distinctive challenges to achieving this success. Accordingly, we report the development of an academic, public land grant University laboratory-based detection assay for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 in samples from various clinical specimens that can be readily deployed in areas where access to testing is limited. The test, which is a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)-based procedure, was validated on samples provided by the state laboratory and submitted for FDA Emergency Use Authorization. Our test exhibits comparable sensitivity and exceeds specificity and inclusivity values compared to other molecular assays. Additionally, this test can be re-configured to meet supply chain shortages, modified for scale up demands, and is amenable to several clinical specimens. Test development also involved 3D engineering critical supplies and formulating a stable collection media that allowed samples to be transported for hours over a dispersed rural region without the need for a cold-chain. These two elements that were critical when shortages impacted testing and when personnel needed to reach areas that were geographically isolated from the testing center. Overall, using a robust, easy-to-adapt methodology, we show that an academic laboratory can supplement COVID-19 testing needs and help local health departments assess and manage outbreaks. This additional testing capacity is particularly germane for smaller cities and rural regions that would otherwise be unable to meet the testing demand.","Ceci, A.; Munoz-Ballester, C.; Tegge, A.; Brown, K.

The aim of this study was to define the key cytokine(s) responsible for trypsin upregulation. Mice were infected with influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) or treated individually or with a combination of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor α. The levels of these cytokines and trypsin in the lungs were monitored. The neutralizing effects of anti-IL-1β antibodies on cytokine and trypsin expression in human A549 cells and lung inflammation in the infected mice were examined. Infection induced interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor α, and ectopic trypsin in mouse lungs in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Intraperitoneal administration of interleukin-1β combined with other cytokines tended to upregulate trypsin and cytokine expression in the lungs, but the combination without interleukin-1β did not induce trypsin. In contrast, incubation of A549 cells with interleukin-1β alone induced both cytokines and trypsin, and anti-interleukin-1β antibody treatment abrogated these effects. Administration of the antibody in the infected mice reduced lung inflammation area. These findings suggest that IL-1β plays a key role in trypsin upregulation and has a pathological role in multiple organ failure.","Indalao, I.

METHODS: Google Trends (GT) was utilized for systematic acquisition of pharyngitis-related search terms (sore throat, cough, fever, cold). Six countries from both hemispheres including four English (United Kingdom, United States, Canada, and Australia) and two non-English speaking countries (Austria and Germany) were selected for further analysis. Time series data on relative search interest for pharyngitis-related search terms, covering a timeframe between 2004 and 2019 were extracted. Following reliability analysis using the intra-class correlation coefficient, the cosinor time series analysis was utilized to determine annual peaks in public-inquiries. RESULTS: The extracted datasets of GT proved to be highly reliable with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.83 to 1.0. Graphical visualization showed annual seasonal peaks for pharyngitis-related search terms in all included countries. The cosinor time series analysis revealed these peaks to be statistically significant during winter months (all p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study revealed seasonal variations for pharyngitis-related terms which corresponded to winter incidence peaks of acute pharyngitis. These results highlight the need for easily accessible information on diagnosis, therapy, and red-flag symptoms for this common disease.

We analyzed a series of critically ill COVID-19 patients to see if any of our dataset’s clinical variables were associated with patient outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of the Hospital in Pordenone from March 11, 2020, to April 17, 2020. Patients’ characteristics of survivors and deceased groups were compared. The variables with a different distribution between the two groups were implemented in a generalized linear regression model (LM) and in an Artificial Neural Network (NN) model to verify the “robustness” of the association with mortality. RESULTS: In the considered period, we reviewed the data of 22 consecutive patients: 8 died. The causes of death were a severe respiratory failure (3), multi-organ failure (1), septic shock (1), pulmonary thromboembolism (2), severe hemorrhage (1). Lymphocyte and the platelet count were significantly lower in the group of deceased patients (p-value 0.043 and 0.020, respectively; cut-off values: 660/mm3; 280,000/mm3, respectively).

Here, we longitudinally measured Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N)-specific antibodies in 1,309 healthcare workers (HCW) including 393 convalescent COVID-19 and 916 COVID-19 negative HCW up to 405 days. From M1 to M7-9 after infection, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies decreased moderately in convalescent HCW in a biphasic model, with men showing a slower decay of anti-N (p=0.02), and a faster decay of anti-S (p=0.0008) than women. At M11-13, anti-N antibodies dramatically decreased (half-life: 210 days) while anti-S stabilized (half-life: 630 days) at a median of 2.41 log Arbitrary Units (AU)/mL (Interquartile Range (IQR): 2.11 -2.75). One case of reinfection was recorded in convalescent HCW (0.47 per 100 person-years) versus 50 in COVID-19 negative HCW (10.11 per 100 person-years).

After SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, anti-S levels reached 4 logs regardless of pre-vaccination IgG levels, type of vaccine, and number of doses.

Though the ease of use and low cost of pulse oximetry makes this an attractive option for identifying problems at an early stage, there are important considerations with pulse oximetry about which patients and providers may not be aware that can interfere with successful implementation of such monitoring programs. Only a few independent studies have examined the performance of pocket oximeters and smart phone–based systems, but the limited available data raise questions about their accuracy, particularly as saturation falls below 90%. There are also multiple sources of error in pulse oximetry that must be accounted for, including rapid fluctuations in measurements when the arterial oxygen pressure/tension falls on the steep portion of the dissociation curve, data acquisition problems when pulsatile blood flow is diminished, accuracy in the setting of severe hypoxemia, dyshemoglobinemias, and other problems.

Lui D et al concluded that COVID-19 infection can lead to exacerbation of pre-existing autoimmune thyroid disease [5]. Therefore, early diagnosis and management of thyroid disorders during the pandemic time might help to reduce any potential risks and improve clinical outcome of COVID-19 infection in patients with previously undiagnosed thyroid disease. One suggested approach is to offer checking TSH level as a screening tool for individuals who are at higher risk of developing thyroid disorder, such as old age, personal history of autoimmune diseases and family history of thyroid illness [6], to increase the chance of early diagnosis and treatment of subclinical and overt thyroid disorder during this pandemic. Patients with confirmed thyroid disorder might be suitable candidates to be prioritised to receive COVID-19 vaccine to reduce risk of morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 infection.

The high prevalence of HIV-1 subtype C in southern Africa necessitates the development of cheap, effective vaccines. One means of production is the use of plants, for which a number of different techniques have been successfully developed. HIV-1 Pr55Gag is a promising HIV-1 vaccine candidate: we compared the expression of this and a truncated Gag (p17/p24) and the p24 capsid subunit in Nicotiana spp. using transgenic plants and transient expression via Agrobacterium tumefaciens and recombinant tobamovirus vectors. We also investigated the influence of subcellular localisation of recombinant protein to the chloroplast and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) on protein yield. We partially purified a selected vaccine candidate and tested its stimulation of a humoral and cellular immune response in mice. RESULTS: Both transient and transgenic expression of the HIV antigens were successful, although expression of Pr55Gag was low in all systems; however, the Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of p24 and p17/p24 yielded best, to more than 1 mg p24/kg fresh weight. Chloroplast targeted protein levels were highest in transient and transgenic expression of p24 and p17/p24. The transiently-expressed p17/p24 was not immunogenic in mice as a homologous vaccine, but it significantly boosted a humoral and T cell immune response primed by a gag DNA vaccine, pTHGagC. CONCLUSION: Transient agroinfiltration was best for expression of all of the recombinant proteins tested, and p24 and p17/p24 were expressed at much higher levels than Pr55Gag. Our results highlight the usefulness of plastid signal peptides in enhancing the production of recombinant proteins meant for use as vaccines. The p17/p24 protein effectively boosted T cell and humoral responses in mice primed by the DNA vaccine pTHGagC, showing that this plant-produced protein has potential for use as a vaccine.","Meyers, Ann; Chakauya, Ereck; Shephard, Enid; Tanzer, Fiona L; Maclean, James; Lynch, Alisson; Williamson, Anna-Lise; Rybicki, Edward P",BMC Biotechnol,255,24

Inequalities and burden of comorbidities of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vary importantly inside the countries. We aimed to analyze the Municipality-level factors associated with a high COVID-19 mortality rate of in Mexico. Methods. We retrieved information from 142,643 cumulative confirmed symptomatic cases and 18,886 deaths of COVID-19 as of June 20th, 2020 from the publicly available database of the Ministry of Health of Mexico. Public official data of the most recent census and surveys of the country were used to adjust a negative binomial regression model with the quintiles (Q) of the distribution of sociodemographic and health outcomes among 2,457 Municipality-level. Expected Mortality Rates (EMR), Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) and 95% Confidence Intervals are reported. Results. Factors associated with high MR of COVID-19, relative to Quintile 1 (Q1), were; diabetes prevalence (Q4, IRR=2.60), obesity prevalence (Q5, IRR=1.93), diabetes mortality rate (Q5, IRR=1.58), proportion of indigenous population (Q2, IRR=1.68), proportion of economically active population (Q5, IRR=1.50), density of economic units that operate essential activities (Q4, IRR=1.54) and population density (Q5, IRR=2.12). We identified 1,351 Municipality-level without confirmed COVID-19 deaths, of which, 202 had nevertheless high (Q4, Mean EMR= 8.0 deaths per 100,000) and 82 very high expected COVID-19 mortality (Q5, Mean EMR= 13.8 deaths per 100,000). Conclusion. This study identified 1,351 Municipality-level of Mexico that, in spite of not having confirmed COVID-19 deaths yet, share characteristics that could eventually lead to a high mortality scenario later in the epidemic and warn against premature easing of mobility restrictions.

California, one of the most populous U.S. states and seat of the 2015 measles outbreak originating at Disneyland, presents an opportunity for observing these changes. This article offers a longitudinal case study of five decades of measles news coverage by the Los Angeles Times and the San Francisco Chronicle, which represented two of the largest news markets in California when the measles vaccine was released, in 1963, and during the 2015 outbreak. Measles reporting during this period displays patterns pointing to an active role for journalists in shaping public understanding of health and medical matters, especially as they recede from public memory, through the employment of available and circulating political and cultural frames. Moreover, journalistic frames in this period of reporting incorporated presentist descriptions of the disease, which imposed present values on the medical past, and which were constructed of decontextualized historical references that supported prevailing contemporary notions of the disease. Framing and the tendency toward presentism, in the context of shifting public health discourse, had the effect of communicating an increasingly severe sounding disease over time, and of shifting blame for that disease’s spread from nature to government to individuals. Journalistic framing and causal stories have much power to shape public understanding of medical matters as they recede from public memory.","Conis, Elena; Hoenicke, Sarah",J Med Humanit,255,20

In this preliminary study, we collected 109 fecal specimens during April–July 2011 from a colony of straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) in an urban park (Agodi Gardens) of Ibadan, Nigeria, and analyzed for Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia duodenalis and E. bieneusi using PCR targeting the small subunit rRNA gene, triosephosphate isomerase gene, and ribosomal internal transcribed spacer, respectively. Genotypes of these enteric parasites were determined by DNA sequencing of the PCR products. Altogether, 6 (5.5%), 0 and 16 (14.7%) specimens were positive for Cryptosporidium spp., G. duodenalis, and E. bieneusi, respectively. DNA sequence analysis of the PCR products indicated the presence of two novel Cryptosporidium genotypes named as bat genotype XIV (in 5 specimens) and bat genotype XV (in 1 specimen) and one known E. bieneusi genotype (Type IV in 1 specimen) and two novel E. bieneusi genotypes (Bat1 in 13 specimens and Bat2 in 2 specimens). In phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, the two novel Cryptosporidium genotypes were genetically related to Bat genotype II previously identified in fruit bats in China and Philippines, whereas the two novel E. bieneusi genotypes were genetically related to Group 5, which contains several known genotypes from primates. With the exception of Type IV, none of the Cryptosporidium and E. bieneusi genotypes found in bats in this study are known human pathogens. Thus, straw-colored fruit bats in Nigeria are mainly infected with host-adapted Cryptosporidium and E. bieneusi genotypes.","Li, Na; Ayinmode, Adekunle B.; Zhang, Hongwei; Feng, Yaoyu; Xiao, Lihua",Int J Parasitol Parasites Wildl,255,16

Data synthesis We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science, from 1st January 2020 to 15th May 2020, for observational studies of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects modeling. A total of 83 eligible studies with 78,874 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included. The pooled prevalence of established diabetes was 14.34% (95% CI 12.62-16.06%). However, the prevalence of diabetes was higher in non-Asian vs. Asian countries (23.34% [95% CI 16.40-30.28] vs. 11.06% [95% CI 9.73-12.39]), and in patients aged ≥60 years vs. those aged <60 years (23.30% [95% CI 19.65-26.94] vs. 8.79% [95% CI 7.56-10.02]). Pre-existing diabetes was associated with an approximate twofold higher risk of having severe/critical COVID-19 illness (n=22 studies; random-effects odds ratio 2.10, 95% CI 1.71-2.57; I 2 =41.5%) and ∼threefold increased risk of in-hospital mortality (n=15 studies; random-effects odds ratio 2.68, 95% CI 2.09-3.44; I 2 =46.7%). Funnel plots and Egger’s tests did not reveal any significant publication bias. Conclusions Pre-existing diabetes is significantly associated with greater risk of severe/critical illness and in-hospital mortality in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.","Mantovani, Alessandro; Byrne, Christopher D.; Zheng, Ming-Hua; Targher, Giovanni",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,255,1

The new virus revealed 79% and 50% genomic similarities with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), respectively. Accordingly, since the disease resists testing and adopting new therapeutics, repositioning pre-existing drugs may present a fast and attractive strategy with known safety, characteristics, and dosage used. However, they are not specific and targeted. Therefore, several drugs have been investigated for their efficacy and safety in the treatment of COVID-19; most of them are undergoing clinical trials. This article summarizes clinical investigations of potential therapeutic drugs used as COVID-19 therapy. Subsequently, it prepares a pattern of results and therapeutic targets to help further experiment designs. We have investigated drugs as classified in the following three groups; 1) The drugs which computationally showed effectiveness (in silico) but needed further lab confirmations; 2) Emetine, Teicoplanin, and Nelfinavir have shown effectiveness in vitro; 3) The drugs currently under clinical trial.","Tarighi, Parastoo; Eftekhari, Samane; Chizari, Milad; Sabernavaei, Mahsa; Jafari, Davod; Mirzabeigi, Parastoo",Eur J Pharmacol,255,1

However, their accessibility can be limited by the long examination time and inability to evaluate multiple samples at once. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the analytical performance of the newly developed rapid molecular assays GENECUBE(®) HQ SARS-CoV-2 and GENECUBE(®) FLU A/B. METHOD: This prospective study was conducted between 14 December 2020 and 9 January 2021 at a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) center. Samples were collected from the nasopharynx with flocked swabs. Molecular tests were performed with the GENECUBE(®) system and reference reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and the results of the two assays were compared. RESULT: Among 1065 samples, 81 (7.6%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the reference RT-PCR. Three showed discordance between GENECUBE(®) HQ SARS-CoV-2 and the reference RT-PCR; the total, positive, and negative samples of concordance for the two assays were 99.7%, 100%, and 99.7%, respectively. All discordant cases were positive with GENECUBE(®) HQ SARS-CoV-2 and negative with the reference RT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all three samples using another molecular assay for SARS-CoV-2.

Until an effective treatment or a vaccine is developed, the current recommendations are to contain the disease, and control its transmission. It is now clear that the primary mode of SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission is aerosol/droplet spread, and by contacting virus‐contaminated surfaces acting as fomites (inanimate vectors). Furthermore, recent data indicate that the live virus particles are present in saliva, and, more alarmingly, asymptomatic individuals may transmit the infection. By virtue of the nature of the practice of dentistry where intrinsically, a high volume of aerosols is produced, as well as the close proximity of dentists and patients during treatment, dentists and allied health staff are considered the highest risk health professional group for acquiring SARS‐CoV‐2 during patient management. Therefore, several organizations and specialty associations have proposed guidelines and recommendations for limiting the transmission of SARS‐COV‐2 from carriers to dentists and vice versa. This paper aims to provide a review of these guidelines, and concludes with a brief look at how the practice of dentistry may be impacted by COVID‐19, in the post‐pandemic era.","Jamal, Mohamed; Shah, Maanas; Almarzooqi, Sameeha Husain; Aber, Hend; Khawaja, Summayah; El Abed, Rashid; Alkhatib, Zuhair; Samaranayake, Lakshman Perera",Oral Dis,255,0

According to the quality indicators recommended by Sociedad Española de Medicina Intensiva Crítica y Unidades Coronarias, and due to the importance of prone position (PP) as a treatment in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, it is fundamental to keep accurate record of serious adverse events occurring during the prone position procedure and its posterior analysis. Objectives To establish fulfilment of the Sociedad Española de Medicina Intensiva Crítica y Unidades Coronarias standards of quality according to the register of serious complications. To identify the incidence of serious complications registered as well as to identify possible factors related to these complications. Method Retrospective, cross-sectional descriptive study, polyvalent ICU (16 beds). Study population Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome treated with PP (January 2012–December 2013). Study variables PP recording, accidental extubation, removal of catheters, decubitus ulcers (DU), ETT obstruction, urgency of the procedure, hours in PP, nutritional intake, type of feeding tube, food regurgitation/retention and use of prokinetics/muscle relaxant. Results The study sample comprised 38 cases, with an adequate record of complications in 92.1% of the cases. DU were the only serious complication recorded, with a 25.7% incidence. Possible factors related to DU: more hours in PP in patients developing DU (p =0.067). Less incidence of DU in well-nourished patients (p =0.577). 82.9% of patients were not appropriately nourished. Conclusions The percentage of records duly completed is very high. The presence of DU (grade 1–2 mostly) is to be noted. There is no statistical significance, although a trend is obsersed, between DU and hours in PP.","Jové Ponseti, E.; Villarrasa Millán, A.; Ortiz Chinchilla, D.",Enfermería Intensiva (English ed.),255,24

Human transmission of this virus occurs via respiratory droplets from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, that are released into the environment after sneezing or coughing. These droplets are capable of staying in the air as aerosols or surfaces and can be transmitted to persons through inhalation or contact with contaminated surfaces. Thus, there is an urgent need for advanced theranostic solutions to control the spread of Covid‐19 infection. The development of such fit‐for‐purpose technologies hinges on a proper understanding of the transmission, incubation and structural characteristics of the virus in the external environment as well as within the host. Hence, this article describes the development of an intrinsic model to describe the incubation characteristics of the virus under varying environmental factors. It also discusses on the evaluation of SARS‐CoV‐2 structural nucleocapsid protein properties via computational approaches to generate high‐affinity binding probes for effective diagnosis and targeted treatment applications by specific targeting of viruses. In addition, this article provides useful insights on the transmission behavior of the virus and create new opportunities for theranostics development.","Sabbih, Godfred O.; Korsah, Maame A.; Jeevanandam, Jaison; Danquah, Michael K.",Biotechnol Prog,255,32

These tasks are challenging and require an integrated knowledge of the complex processes that regulate gene expression and, ultimately, protein functionality in vivo, the effects of mutations/polymorphisms and the different sources of interindividual phenotypic variability. A remarkable example of our advances in these challenging tasks is the highly polymorphic CYP2D6 gene, which encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in the metabolization of many of the most marketed drugs (including SARS-Cov-2 therapies such as hydroxychloroquine). Since the introduction of simple activity scores (AS) over 10 years ago, its ability to establish genotype–phenotype correlations on the drug metabolizing capacity of this enzyme in human population has provided lessons that will help to improve this type of score for this, and likely many other human genes and proteins. Multidisciplinary research emerges as the best approach to incorporate additional concepts to refine and improve such functional/activity scores for the CYP2D6 gene, as well as for many other human genes associated with simple and complex genetic diseases.","Pey, Angel L.",J Pers Med,255,29

Limited data exist on the epidemiology of ICU-acquired infections in China. This retrospective study was carried out to determine the current status of nosocomial infection in China. METHODS: A retrospective review of nococomial infections in the ICU of a tertiary hospital in East China between 2003 and 2007 was performed. Nosocomial infections were defined according to the definitions of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The overall patient nosocomial infection rate, the incidence density rate of nosocomial infections, the excess length of stay, and distribution of nosocomial infection sites were determined. Then, pathogen and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were further investigated. RESULTS: Among 1980 patients admitted over the period of time, the overall patient nosocomial infection rate was 26.8% or 51.0 per 1000 patient days., Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) accounted for most of the infections (68.4%), followed by urinary tract infections (UTI, 15.9%), bloodstream (BSI, 5.9%), and gastrointestinal tract (GI, 2.5%) infections. There was no significant change in LRTI, UTI and BSI infection rates during the 5 years. However, GI rate was significantly decreased from 5.5% in 2003 to 0.4% in 2007. In addition, A. baumannii, C. albicans and S. epidermidis were the most frequent pathogens isolated in patients with LRTIs, UTIs and BSIs, respectively. The rates of isolates resistant to commonly used antibiotics ranged from 24.0% to 93.1%. CONCLUSION: There was a high and relatively stable rate of nosocomial infections in the ICU of a tertiary hospital in China through year 2003–2007, with some differences in the distribution of the infection sites, and pathogen and antibiotic susceptibility profiles from those reported from the Western countries. Guidelines for surveillance and prevention of nosocomial infections must be implemented in order to reduce the rate.","Ding, Ji-Guang; Sun, Qing-Feng; Li, Ke-Cheng; Zheng, Ming-Hua; Miao, Xiao-Hui; Ni, Wu; Hong, Liang; Yang, Jin-Xian; Ruan, Zhan-Wei; Zhou, Rui-Wei; Zhou, Hai-Jiao; He, Wen-Fei",BMC Infect Dis,255,2

Here, we demonstrate a CRISPR-Cas13-based strategy, PAC-MAN (prophylactic antiviral CRISPR in human cells), for viral inhibition that can effectively degrade RNA from SARS-CoV-2 sequences and live influenza A virus (IAV) in human lung epithelial cells. We designed and screened CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) targeting conserved viral regions and identified functional crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2. This approach effectively reduced H1N1 IAV load in respiratory epithelial cells. Our bioinformatic analysis showed that a group of only six crRNAs can target more than 90% of all coronaviruses. With the development of a safe and effective system for respiratory tract delivery, PAC-MAN has the potential to become an important pan-coronavirus inhibition strategy.","Abbott, Timothy R.; Dhamdhere, Girija; Liu, Yanxia; Lin, Xueqiu; Goudy, Laine; Zeng, Leiping; Chemparathy, Augustine; Chmura, Stephen; Heaton, Nicholas S.; Debs, Robert; Pande, Tara; Endy, Drew; La Russa, Marie F.; Lewis, David B.; Qi, Lei S.",Cell,255,24

Using a multiplex platform to assess serum IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 N, S and RBD proteins, and detailed symptom reporting, we screened over 500 HCW (25% of the total workforce) in a quaternary level hospital to explore the relationship between workplace and evidence of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Whilst 45% of the cohort reported symptoms that they consider may have represented COVID-19, overall seroprevalence was 14% with anosmia and fever being the most discriminating symptoms for seropositive status. There was a significant difference in seropositive status between staff working in clinical and non-clinical roles (9% patient facing critical care, 15% patient facing non-critical care, 22% nonpatient facing). In the seropositive cohort, symptom severity increased with age for men and not for women. In contrast, there was no relationship between symptom severity and age or sex in the seronegative cohort reporting possible COVID-19 symptoms. Of the 12 staff screened PCR positive (10 symptomatic), 3 showed no evidence of seroconversion in convalescence. Conclusion: The current approach to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) appears highly effective in protecting staff from patient acquired infection in the critical care environment including protecting staff managing interhospital transfers of COVID-19 patients. The relationship between seroconversion and disease severity in different demographics warrants further investigation. Longitudinally paired virological and serological surveillance, with symptom reporting are urgently required to better understand the role of antibody in the outcome of HCW exposure during subsequent waves of COVID-19 in health care environments.","Baxendale, D.

We hypothesized that this might also affect the number of PED visits due to injuries. Therefore, we investigated these changes in PED visits after the COVID-19 outbreak through a long-term multicenter observational study. We assessed the changes in the proportion of injured pediatric patients’ weekly visits and the trend in the rate changes since the COVID-19 epidemic began by segmented regression analysis. We also evaluated the weekly change in the distribution of detailed diagnostic codes among pediatric patients with injuries before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The proportion of injury-related PED visits increased when COVID-19 was first confirmed in Korea. After the COVID-19 epidemic, the proportion of foreign body ingestions and fracture patients among all pediatric patients with injuries increased significantly every week. The changes in the proportion of injured pediatric patients after the COVID-19 outbreak may have been the result of social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. The risk of pediatric infections decreased but the risk of injury remained. Therefore, parents should take precautions to prevent infectious diseases and be careful to prevent children’s injuries at home.","Choi, Arum; Bae, Woori; Kim, Kyunghoon; Kim, Sukil",Children (Basel),255,1

We recently identified immunogenic epitopes within CVB3 viral protein 1 that induce anti-viral T cell responses in mouse models of CVB infections. In our investigations to determine the protective responses of the viral epitopes, we unexpectedly noted that animals immunized with complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) alone and later challenged with CVB3 were completely protected against myocarditis. Similarly, the pancreatitis-inducing ability of CVB3 was remarkably reduced to only 10% in the CFA group as opposed to 73.3% in the control group that received no CFA. Additionally, no mortalities were noted in the CFA group, whereas 40% of control animals died during the course of 21 days post-infection with CVB3. Taken together, our data suggest that the adjuvant effects of CFA may be sufficient for protection against CVB infections. These observations may provide new insights into our understanding of the occurrence of viral infections. One example is Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) as individuals suffering from COVID-19 who have been vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin appear to have fewer morbidities and mortalities than unvaccinated individuals.","Gangaplara, Arunakumar; Massilamany, Chandirasegaran; Lasrado, Ninaad; Steffen, David; Reddy, Jay",bioRxiv,255,1

Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen (DO) in the Thames River are usually around 8 mg/l and 7.5 mg/l respectively, while phosphorus and ammonium range between 0.1–0.6 mg/l and 0.1–0.4 mg/l respectively. The Thames has seen great improvements in water quality over the past decades, due to high levels of sewage treatment and regulation of industrial effluents which have improved water quality conditions. Conversely, the Hindon River suffers from extremely poor water quality and this is mainly attributed to the direct discharge of partially treated or untreated municipal and industrial wastewater into the river. BOD is in the range of 15–60 mg/l and DO is below 5 mg/l. Phosphorus ranges around 2–6 mg/l at most of the monitoring stations and ammonia-nitrogen in the range of 10–40 mg /l in Galeta at Hindon. The analysis of variance also depicts the spatial and temporal variation in water quality in the Hindon River. Besides, non-point sources, pollution from point sources with minimal base flow in the river during dry season, result in low dilution capacity causing high pollutant concentrations which impacts the river ecosystem and fisheries. To restore the Hindon River, resources must be focussed on mainly treating sewage and industrial effluents and by developing appropriate river basin management and regulatory plans.","Sharma, Vasker; Joshi, Himanshu; Bowes, Michael J.",Water Air Soil Pollut,255,14

Accordingly, an increasing number of psychosocial intervention studies have included SpWb as a study endpoint, and may improve SpWb even if not designed explicitly to do so. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated effects of psychosocial interventions on SpWb in adults with cancer and tested potential moderators of intervention effects. Methods: Six literature databases were systematically searched to identify RCTs of psychosocial interventions in which SpWb was an outcome. Doctoral-level rater pairs extracted data using Covidence following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Standard meta-analytic techniques were applied, including meta-regression with robust variance estimation and risk-of-bias sensitivity analysis. Results: Forty-one RCTs were identified, encompassing 88 treatment effects among 3883 survivors. Interventions were associated with significant improvements in SpWb (g = 0.22, 95% CI [0.14, 0.29], p < 0.0001). Studies assessing the FACIT-Sp demonstrated larger effect sizes than did those using other measures of SpWb (g = 0.25, 95% CI [0.17, 0.34], vs. g = 0.10, 95% CI [-0.02, 0.23], p = 0.03]. No other intervention, clinical, or demographic characteristics significantly moderated effect size. Conclusions: Psychosocial interventions are associated with small-to-medium-sized effects on SpWb among cancer survivors. Future research should focus on conceptually coherent interventions explicitly targeting SpWb and evaluate interventions in samples that are diverse with respect to race and ethnicity, sex and cancer type.","McLouth, Laurie E; Ford, C Graham; Pustejovsky, James E; Park, Crystal L; Sherman, Allen C; Trevino, Kelly; Salsman, John M",Psychooncology,255,20

During the COVID-19 pandemic, significant increases in close-to-home LTPA raised concerns for public health and land managers alike. This project illustrates a novel, integrated monitoring approach to estimating COVID-19 risk exposure during trail-related LTPA, with implications for other public spaces. METHODS: COVID-19 risk exposure was conservatively calculated from the integration of in-person observations of LTPA trail groups and automated monitoring of trail traffic volumes in spring 2020. Trained observers tracked 1,477 groups. Traffic volume estimates and observed distance data were integrated, considering occlusion and total trail traffic volume. RESULTS: 70% of groups had one or more encounters. Among individual users, 38.5% were 100% compliant across all events observed but 32.7% were not compliant. Considering trail traffic volumes and annual daily traffic volume, exposure to risk of COVID-19 was conservatively estimated at 61.5% among individual trail users. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring opportunities and challenges of health risk exposure exist. Adjusted exposure measures based on volume counts can approximate numbers of unique individuals exposed, inform management actions, efficacy and policy decisions.","Schneider, Ingrid E.; Lindsey, Greg; Petesch, Michael; Wynveen, Christopher J.; Budruk, Megha; Hendricks, Bill; Gibson, Heather; Shinew, Kim; Stein, Taylor; VanderWoude, Deonne",J Transp Health,255,26

Herein, we develop a rapid and unamplified nanosensing platform for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human throat swab specimens. A gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-decorated graphene field-effect transistor (G-FET) sensor was fabricated, after which complementary phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligos (PMO) probe was immobilized on the AuNP surface. This sensor allowed for highly sensitive testing of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp as PMO does not have charges, leading to low background signal. Not only did the method present a low limit of detection in PBS (0.37 fM), throat swab (2.29 fM), and serum (3.99 fM), but also it achieved a rapid response to COVID-19 patients’ samples within 2 min. The developed nanosensor was capable of analyzing RNA extracts from 30 real clinical samples. The results show that the sensor could differentiate the healthy people from infected people, which are in high agreement with RT-PCR results (Kappa index = 0.92). Furthermore, a well-defined distinction between SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and SARS-CoV RdRp was also made. Therefore, we believe that this work provides a satisfactory, attractive option for COVID-19 diagnosis.","Li, Jiahao; Wu, Ding; Yu, Yi; Li, Tingxian; Li, Kun; Xiao, Meng-Meng; Li, Yirong; Zhang, Zhi-Yong; Zhang, Guo-Jun",Biosens Bioelectron,255,11

These changes correspond to its transmission and pathogenicity due to which the concept of social distancing appeared into the picture. In this paper, a few findings from the whole genome sequence analysis of viral genome sequences submitted from India are presented. The data used for analysis comprises 440 collective genome sequences of virus submitted in GenBank, GISAID, and SRA projects, from around the world as well as 28 viral sequences from India. Multiple sequence alignment of all genome sequences was performed and analysed. A novel non-synonymous mutation 4809C>T (S1515F) in NSP3 gene of SARS-CoV2 Indian strains is reported along with other frequent and important changes from around the world: 3037C>T, 14408C>T, and 23403A>G. The novel change was observed in samples collected in the month of March, whereas was found to be absent in samples collected in January with the respective persons’ travel history to China. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the sequences with this change as one separate clade. Mutation was predicted as stabilising change by insilco tool DynaMut. A second patient in the world to our knowledge with multiple (Wuhan and USA) strain contraction was observed in this study. The infected person is among the two early infected patients with travel history to China. Strains sequenced in Iran stood out to have different variants, as most of the reported frequent variants were not observed. The objective of this paper is to highlight the similarities and changes observed in the submitted Indian viral strains. This helps to keep track on the activity, that how virus is changing into a new subtype. Major strains observed were European with the novel change in India and other being emergent clade of Iran.

The research is based on a qualitative Delphi study encompassing 49 experts from eleven EU countries. The paper aims to demonstrate how disruptive innovations affect organizational changes and determine critical factors in organizations that impact the initiating and promoting R&D of disruptive innovation. We discovered that disruptive innovations impact product/process development methods, new production concepts, new materials for products, and new organization plans. Additionally, we identified organizational changes related to the development and use of disruptive innovations in the future. We also indicate how disruptive innovations influence social and technological changes in the organizational environment. The analysis also disclosed three main groups of disruptive innovations and their impact on future smart factory development, namely the following: technological changes, the emergence of innovative products, business models and solutions and organizational culture as one of the crucial key success factors. The analysis also examined the enablers of the successful development/introduction of disruptive innovations, wherein internal and external factors were determined. Additionally, we presented obstacles and the approaches necessary to mitigate them. We can conclude from the findings that in the timeframe of 5–10 years, only the SME that uses/develops disruptive innovations will survive in the market. However, the companies do not always have a clear idea of the meaning of disruptive innovations. Therefore, it is important to set clear goals regarding the achievement of disruptive innovations in companies.

This study investigates the types and prevalence of occupational disruptions, and associated symptoms of mental illness, among Australian frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A national cross-sectional online survey was conducted between 27 August and 23 October 2020. Frontline healthcare workers were invited to participate via dissemination from major health organisations, professional associations or colleges, universities, government contacts, and national media. Data were collected on demographics, home and work situations, and validated scales of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and burnout. Results: Complete responses were received from 7846 healthcare workers (82.4%). Most respondents were female (80.9%) and resided in the Australian state of Victoria (85.2%). Changes to working conditions were common, with 48.5% reporting altered paid or unpaid hours, and many redeployed (16.8%) or changing work roles (27.3%). Nearly a third (30.8%) had experienced a reduction in household income during the pandemic. Symptoms of mental illness were common, being present in 62.1% of participants. Many respondents felt well supported by their workplaces (68.3%) and believed that workplace communication was timely and useful (74.4%). Participants who felt well supported by their organisation had approximately half the risk of experiencing moderate to severe anxiety, depression, burnout, and PTSD. Half (50.4%) of respondents indicated a need for additional training in using personal protective equipment and/or caring for patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: Occupational disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic occurred commonly in health organisations and were associated with worse mental health outcomes in the Australian health workforce. Feeling well supported was associated with significantly fewer adverse mental health outcomes.

A Comparative Study with the Pre-COVID Era in an Italian Breast Unit,16.262667,7.2184525,2020-11-11,"OBJECTIVE: The susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model and its variants are widely used to predict the progress of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide, despite their rather simplistic nature. Nevertheless, robust estimation of the SIR model presents a significant challenge, particularly with limited and possibly noisy data in the initial phase of the pandemic. METHODS: The K-means algorithm is used to perform a cluster analysis of the top 10 countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases, to observe if there are any significant differences among countries in terms of robustness. RESULTS: As a result of model variation tests, the robustness of parameter estimates is found to be particularly problematic in developing countries. The incompatibility of parameter estimates with the observed characteristics of COVID-19 is another potential problem. Hence, a series of research questions are visited. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a Single Parameter Estimation (SPE) approach to circumvent these potential problems if the basic SIR is the model of choice, and we check the robustness of this new approach by model variation and structured permutation tests. Dissemination of quality predictions is critical for policy- and decision-makers in shedding light on the next phases of the pandemic.","Senel, Kerem; Ozdinc, Mesut; Ozturkcan, Selcen",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,255,1

These viruses have also contributed internal genes to H5N1, H5N6, H7N9, and H10N8 viruses, which have been isolated from humans with infections and are a substantial public health threat. To investigate the potential pathogenic mechanism of the H9N2 virus, we performed serial lung-to-lung passage of an avirulent H9N2 avian influenza virus (A/Chicken/Shandong/416/2016 [SD/416]) in mice to increase the pathogenicity of this virus. We generated a mouse-adapted (MA) virus that exhibited increased viral titers in the lungs, caused severe lung damage in mice, and induced body weight loss in mice; however, the avirulent parental virus did not cause any clinical symptoms in infected mice. Global gene expression analysis was performed and indicated that the transcriptional responses of these viruses were distinct. The lungs of mice infected with the MA virus exhibited the downregulation of genes related to innate immunity and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, which was not seen in infections with the avirulent parental virus. These data indicated that the MA virus might evade immune surveillance and changed its replication capacity to increase the viral replication level and pathogenicity. Our study demonstrates that host factors play an important role in the adaptive evolution of influenza virus in new hosts.

Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which causes pneumonia, requires intensive care unit hospitalization in about 10% of cases and can lead to a fatal outcome. Several efforts are currently made to find a treatment for COVID-19 patients. So far, several anti-viral and immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs have demonstrated some efficacy on COVID-19 both in vitro and in animal models as well as in cases series. In COVID-19 patients a pro-inflammatory status with high levels of interleukin (IL)-1B, IL-1 receptor (R)A and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α has been demonstrated. Moreover, high levels of IL-6 and TNF-α have been observed in patients requiring intensive-care-unit hospitalization. This provided rationale for the use of anti-rheumatic drugs as potential treatments for this severe viral infection. Other agents, such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine might have a direct anti-viral effect. The anti-viral aspect of immunosuppressants towards a variety of viruses has been known since long time and it is herein discussed in the view of searching for a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Perricone, Carlo; Triggianese, Paola; Bartoloni, Elena; Cafaro, Giacomo; Bonifacio, Angelo F.; Bursi, Roberto; Perricone, Roberto; Gerli, Roberto",J Autoimmun,255,17

What has emerged during the past 1 year is that, apart from its potentially fatal respiratory presentation from which the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) derives its name, it presents with a myriad of gastrointestinal (GI) and liver manifestations. Expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor throughout the GI tract and liver, which is the receptor for the SARS-CoV-2, may be responsible for the GI and liver manifestations. Besides acting directly via the ACE-2 receptor, the virus triggers a potent immune response, which might have a role in pathogenesis. The virus leads to derangement in liver function tests in close to 50% of the patients. The impact of these derangements in patients with a normal underlying liver seems to be innocuous. Severe clinical presentations include acute decompensation and acute-on-chronic liver failure in a patient with chronic liver disease, leading to high mortality. Evolving data suggests that, contrary to intuition, liver transplant recipients and patients with autoimmune liver disease on immunosuppression do not have increased mortality. The exact mechanism underlying why immunosuppressed patients fare well as compared to other patients remains to be deciphered. With newer variants of COVID-19, which can spread faster than the original strain, the data on hepatic manifestations needs to be updated to keep a step ahead of the virus.","Elhence, Anshuman; Vaishnav, Manas; Biswas, Sagnik; Chauhan, Ashish; Anand, Abhinav; Shalimar,",J Clin Transl Hepatol,255,10

The number of scientific reports and publications increases exponentially day by day. While the majority of infected subjects are asymptomatic or show mild symptoms, there is an important proportion of patients who requires hospitalization and, sometimes, intensive care. Immune response to novel coronavirus is complex, involves both innate and adaptive immunity, and is biphasic. Significant differences were observed when comparing severe and non-severe patients. Analysis of the reported results from clinical trials clearly show an involvement of specific cellular immunity (predominantly leucopenia, decreased counts of CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) T lymphocytes, changes of T cell compartment) and the so-called cytokine storm, which is associated with worsening of symptoms and the promotion of lung damage. An interesting finding regarding eosinopenia that can have both diagnostic and prognostic value is reported by some authors. Examination of selected immune parameters could help to identify severe patients with the risk of unfavorable course of the disease, predict the prognosis and recognize improvement in the clinical status. Moreover, detailed analysis of the immune changes could help to select novel prospective therapeutic strategies.","Jesenak, Milos; Brndiarova, Miroslava; Urbancikova, Ingrid; Rennerova, Zuzana; Vojtkova, Jarmila; Bobcakova, Anna; Ostro, Robert; Banovcin, Peter",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,255,28

The emergence of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS‐CoV‐2) variants has raised concerns of reduced sensitivity to neutralization by their elicited antibodies. We aimed to systematically review the most recent in vitro studies evaluating the effectiveness of BNT162b2 and mRNA‐1273 induced neutralizing antibodies against SARS‐CoV‐2 variants of concern. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science in addition to bioRxiv and medRxiv with terms including ‘SARS‐CoV‐2’, ‘BNT162b2’, ‘mRNA‐1273’, and ‘neutralizing antibody’ up to June 29, 2021. A modified version of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist was used for assessing included study quality. A total 36 in vitro studies meeting the eligibility criteria were included in this systematic review. B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), and B.1.617.2 (Delta) are four SARS‐CoV‐2 variants that have recently been identified as variants of concern. Included studies implemented different methods regarding pseudovirus or live virus neutralization assays for measuring neutralization titres against utilized viruses. After two dose vaccination by BNT162b2 or mRNA‐1273, the B.1.351 variant had the least sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies, while B.1.1.7 variant had the most sensitivity; that is, it was better neutralized relative to the comparator strain. P.1 and B.1.617.2 variants had an intermediate level of impaired naturalization activity of antibodies elicited by prior vaccination. Our review suggests that immune sera derived from vaccinated individuals might show reduced protection of individuals immunized with mRNA vaccines against more recent SARS‐CoV‐2 variants of concern.","Noori, Maryam; Nejadghaderi, Seyed Aria; Arshi, Shahnam; Carson‐Chahhoud, Kristin; Ansarin, Khalil; Kolahi, Ali‐Asghar; Safiri, Saeid",Rev Med Virol,255,14

Due to its ability to absorb light in the blue spectrum, CUR is also used as a photosensitizer (PS) in antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy (aPDT). However, CUR is hydrophobic, unstable in solutions, and has low bioavailability, which hinders its clinical use. To circumvent these drawbacks, drug delivery systems (DDSs) have been used. In this review, we summarize the DDSs used to carry CUR and their antimicrobial effect against viruses, bacteria, and fungi, including drug-resistant strains and emergent pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. The reviewed DDSs include colloidal (micelles, liposomes, nanoemulsions, cyclodextrins, chitosan, and other polymeric nanoparticles), metallic, and mesoporous particles, as well as graphene, quantum dots, and hybrid nanosystems such as films and hydrogels. Free (non-encapsulated) CUR and CUR loaded in DDSs have a broad-spectrum antimicrobial action when used alone or as a PS in aPDT. They also show low cytotoxicity, in vivo biocompatibility, and improved wound healing. Although there are several in vitro and some in vivo investigations describing the nanotechnological aspects and the potential antimicrobial application of CUR-loaded DDSs, clinical trials are not reported and further studies should translate this evidence to the clinical scenarios of infections.","Trigo-Gutierrez, Jeffersson Krishan; Vega-Chacón, Yuliana; Soares, Amanda Brandão; Mima, Ewerton Garcia de Oliveira",Int J Mol Sci,255,16

Methods: We analyzed the temporal distribution of EMS calls in the Austin-Travis County area between January 1st, 2019, and December 31st, 2020. Change point detection was performed to identify critical dates marking changes in EMS call distributions, and time series regression was applied for forecasting Covid-19 EMS incidents. Results: Two critical dates marked the impact of Covid-19 on the distribution of EMS calls: March 17th, when the daily number of non-pandemic EMS incidents dropped significantly, and May 13th, by which the daily number of EMS calls climbed back to 75% of the number in pre-Covid-19 time. The new daily count of the hospitalization of Covid-19 patients alone proves a powerful predictor of the number of pandemic EMS calls, with an r2 value equal to 0.85. In particular, for every 2.5 cases where EMS takes a Covid-19 patient to a hospital, one person is admitted. Conclusion: The mean daily number of non-pandemic EMS demand was significantly less than the period before Covid-19 pandemic. The number of EMS calls for Covid-19 symptoms can be predicted from the daily new hospitalization of Covid-19 patients. These findings may be of interest to EMS departments as they plan for future pandemics, including the ability to predict pandemic-related calls in an effort to adjust a targeted response.","Xie, Yangxinyu; Kulpanowski, David; Ong, Joshua; Nikolova, Evdokia; Tran, Ngoc Mai",International journal of clinical practice,255,3

OBJECTIVE: We implemented a strategy to reduce nosocomial acquisition. METHODS: We summarized our experience in implementing a multipronged infection control strategy in the first 300 days (December 31, 2019, to October 25, 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic under the governance of Hospital Authority in Hong Kong. RESULTS: Of 5,296 COVID-19 patients, 4,808 (90.8%) were diagnosed in the first pandemic wave (142 cases), second wave (896 cases), and third wave (3,770 cases) in Hong Kong. With the exception of 1 patient who died before admission, all COVID-19 patients were admitted to the public healthcare system for a total of 78,834 COVID-19 patient days. The median length of stay was 13 days (range, 1–128). Of 81,955 HCWs, 38 HCWs (0.05%; 2 doctors and 11 nurses and 25 nonprofessional staff) acquired COVID-19. With the exception of 5 of 38 HCWs (13.2%) infected by HCW-to-HCW transmission in the nonclinical settings, no HCW had documented transmission from COVID-19 patients in the hospitals.

However, these measures have been associated with the onset or increase of anxiety and depression symptoms in the population. Music listening was previously shown to regulate emotion, consequently reducing depression symptoms. Since previous studies with Brazilian samples have already shown a high prevalence of depressive symptoms during the first confinement period, the aim of this study was threefold: (i) to compare groups with severe depression symptoms and no depression in what concerns to demographic and socio-economic factors as well as symptoms of anxiety and resilience levels, (ii) to explore changes in music listening daily routine during the confinement measures by both groups (no depression and severe depression), and (iii) to investigate which were the main factors influencing both two groups to music listening during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study included 494 Brazilian respondents aged 18 years and above. Our online survey comprised demographics, socio-economic, and COVID-19 related questionnaires, with questions regarding music listening used during social distancing measures on which the participants rated how much each of the 41 potential reasons for listening to music changed in importance compared to the situation before the pandemic and also the evaluation of anxiety, depression, and resilience levels. The respondents with severe depression were younger and showed higher levels of anxiety symptoms and lower resilience level. Furthermore, they were increasingly likely to listen to music to feel emotionally better with the situation, to feel comfort, to forget problems, to be energetic, to decrease sad feelings, to relax, to cheer up, to forget concerns, to express feelings, to reduce anxiety, to remember better times, to relieve boredom, to mentally stimulate themselves, and to ward off stressful thoughts compared to the participants with no depression. The exploratory factor analysis (FA) identified four types of music listening functions during social distancing measures: negative mood management, cognitive functioning, positive mood management, and physical involvement, in which the participants with severe depression revealed significant differences compared to non-depressed participants for the negative mood management factor, which shows the importance of music listening to regulate their negative emotions. As a conclusion, we can argue that most of our respondents used music listening to cope with and regulate their moods during confinement, especially those who presented with severe depression symptoms.","Ribeiro, Fabiana Silva; Lessa, João Paulo Araújo; Delmolin, Guilherme; Santos, Flávia H.",Front Psychol,255,29

In recent years, numerous proofs of concept have established that plants can produce biologically active recombinant proteins and immunologically relevant vaccine antigens that are comparable to those made in conventional expression systems. Driving many of these advances is the remarkable plasticity of the plant proteome which enables extensive engineering of the host cell, as well as the development of improved expression vectors facilitating higher levels of protein production. To date, the only plant‐derived viral glycoprotein to be tested in humans is the influenza haemagglutinin which expresses at ~50 mg/kg. However, many other viral glycoproteins that have potential as vaccine immunogens only accumulate at low levels in planta. A critical consideration for the production of many of these proteins in heterologous expression systems is the complexity of post‐translational modifications, such as control of folding, glycosylation and disulphide bridging, which is required to reproduce the native glycoprotein structure. In this review, we will address potential shortcomings of plant expression systems and discuss strategies to optimally exploit the technology for the production of immunologically relevant and structurally authentic glycoproteins for use as vaccine immunogens.","Margolin, Emmanuel; Chapman, Ros; Williamson, Anna‐Lise; Rybicki, Edward P.; Meyers, Ann E.",Plant Biotechnol J,255,20

Here we combined nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry (nESI-MS) and acoustic levitation (AL) techniques to study the chlorination chemistry of three model lipids (DPPE, POPG, DOPG) mediated by HOCl at the air-water interface of levitated water droplet. For DPPE with no CC double bonds, HOCl was insensitive to the alkane chains, and showed considerable delay directing to head amino groups compared to that in aqueous environment. Chlorination chemistry, for POPG and DOPG with CC double bonds, preferentially reacted with double bonds of one chain. The mechanism was discussed in light of these observations, and it is concluded that the increased hydrophilicity of the chlorinated chain disturbed the lipid packing and attracted it toward the water phase. In addition, the reaction rate constant and reactive uptake coefficient suggested that the chlorination of lipids exposed to HOCl at the air-water interface is likely to occur rapidly. These results gain the knowledge of HOCl mediated lipid interface reaction at the molecule level, and would better understand the adverse health effects associated with elevated indoor pollutants.","Guo, Changlu; Yang, Miao; He, Jing; Kan, Guangfeng; Yu, Kai; Liu, Zhuo; Lin, Sifan; Jiang, Jie; Zhang, Hong",Sci Total Environ,255,20

METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively studied patients admitted with an acute cardiovascular syndrome as their principal diagnosis to 13 hospitals across Northwell Health during March 11 through May 26, 2020 (first COVID‐19 epidemic wave) and the same period in 2019. Three thousand sixteen patients (242 COVID‐19 positive) were admitted for an acute cardiovascular syndrome during the first COVID‐19 wave compared with 9422 patients 1 year prior (decrease of 68.0%, P<0.001). During this time, patients with cardiovascular disease presented later to the hospital (360 versus 120 minutes for acute myocardial infarction), underwent fewer procedures (34.6% versus 45.6%, P<0.001), were less likely to be treated in an intensive care unit setting (8.7% versus 10.8%, P<0.001), and had a longer hospital stay (2.91 [1.71–6.05] versus 2.87 [1.82–4.95] days, P=0.033). Inpatient cardiovascular mortality during the first epidemic outbreak increased by 111.1% (3.8 versus 1.8, P<0.001) and was not related to COVID‐19‐related admissions, all cause in‐hospital mortality, or incidence of out‐of‐hospital cardiac deaths in New York. Admission during the first COVID‐19 surge along with age and positive COVID‐19 test independently predicted mortality for cardiovascular admissions (odds ratios, 1.30, 1.05, and 5.09, respectively, P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: A lower rate and later presentation of patients with cardiovascular pathology, coupled with deviation from common clinical practice mandated by the first wave of the COVID‐19 pandemic, might have accounted for higher in‐hospital cardiovascular mortality during that period.","Mountantonakis, Stavros E.; Makker, Parth; Saleh, Moussa; Coleman, Kristie M.; Husk, Gregg; Jauhar, Rajiv; Singh, Varinder; Epstein, Laurence M.; Kuvin, Jeffrey",J Am Heart Assoc,255,16

Several pieces of experimental evidence suggest that genetic variants influencing the onset, maintenance and resolution of the immune response may be fundamental in predicting the evolution of the disease. The identification of genetic variants behind immune system reactivity and function in COVID-19 may help in the elaboration of personalized therapeutic strategies. In the frenetic look for universally shared treatment plans, those genetic variants that are common to other diseases/models may also help in addressing future research in terms of drug repurposing.

We found that the late gestation placental expression pattern of TMPRSS2 (the spike proteinase required for SARS-CoV-2 cellular infection), is usually absent in the trophoblast but rarely, weakly expressed in the placental endothelium. We now show the developmental protein expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 by immunohistochemistry throughout gestation, from first through third trimester. We found TMPRSS2 expression was rarely detectable in villous endothelium and very rarely detectable in the ST across gestation. We found ACE2 expression varied during gestation with circumferential ST expression more common in early gestations and polarized expression more common in later gestation. Although this study is small, these preliminary results suggest that earlier gestation pregnancies may be more vulnerable to infection than later gestation pregnancies.","Roberts, Drucilla J; Bebell, Lisa M; Edlow, Andrea G",J Infect Dis,255,20

OBJECTIVE: To describe our approach in using health information technology to provide a continuum of services during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our health system deployed four COVID-19 telehealth programs, and four biomedical informatics innovations to screen and care for COVID-19 patients. Using programmatic and electronic health record data we describe the implementation and initial utilization. RESULTS: Through collaboration across multi-disciplinary teams and strategic planning, four telehealth program initiatives have been deployed in response to COVID-19: virtual urgent care screening, remote patient monitoring for COVID-19 positive patients, continuous virtual monitoring to reduce workforce risk and utilization of personal protective equipment, and the transition of outpatient care to telehealth. Biomedical Informatics was integral to our institutional response in supporting clinical care through new and reconfigured technologies. Through linking the telehealth systems and the electronic health record, we have the ability to monitor and track patients through a continuum of COVID-19 services. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 has facilitated the rapid expansion and utilization of telehealth and health informatics services. We anticipate that patients and providers will view enhanced telehealth services as an essential aspect of the healthcare system. Continuation of telehealth payment models at federal and private levels will be a key factor in whether this new uptake is sustained. CONCLUSION: There are substantial benefits in utilizing telehealth during the COVID-19, including the ability to rapidly scale the number of patients being screened and providing continuity of care.","Ford, Dee; Harvey, Jillian B; McElligott, James; King, Kathryn; Simpson, Kit N; Valenta, Shawn; Warr, Emily H; Walsh, Tasia; Debenham, Ellen; Teasdale, Carla; Meystre, Stephane; Obeid, Jihad S; Lenert, Leslie A",J Am Med Inform Assoc,255,18

The objective of this systematic review is to identify the facilitators and barriers affecting the delivery of routine health care services during the pandemic to provide a framework for future research. In total, 32 articles were identified for common themes surrounding facilitators of routine care during COVID-19. Identified constructed in the literature include enhanced education initiatives for parents/patients regarding routine vaccinations, an importance of routine vaccinations as compared to the risk of COVID-19 infection, an enhanced use of telehealth resources (including diagnostic imagery) and identified patient throughput/PPE initiatives. Reviewers identified the following barriers to the delivery of routine care: conservation of medical providers and PPE for non-routine (acute) care delivery needs, specific routine care services incongruent the telehealth care delivery methods, and job-loss/food insecurity.

A literature review",16.29239,6.9147344,2021-03-25,"BACKGROUND: The number of opioid-involved overdose deaths in the United States remains a national crisis. The HEALing Communities Study (HCS) will test whether Communities That HEAL (CTH), a community-engaged intervention, can decrease opioid-involved deaths in intervention communities (n = 33), relative to wait-list communities (n = 34), from four states. The CTH intervention seeks to facilitate widespread implementation of three evidence-based practices (EBPs) with the potential to reduce opioid-involved overdose fatalities: overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND), effective delivery of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), and safer opioid analgesic prescribing. A key challenge was delineating an EBP implementation approach useful for all HCS communities. METHODS: A workgroup composed of EBP experts from HCS research sites used literature reviews and expert consensus to: 1) compile strategies and associated resources for implementing EBPs primarily targeting individuals 18 and older; and 2) determine allowable community flexibility in EBP implementation. The workgroup developed the Opioid-overdose Reduction Continuum of Care Approach (ORCCA) to organize EBP strategies and resources to facilitate EBP implementation. CONCLUSIONS: The ORCCA includes required and recommended EBP strategies, priority populations, and community settings. Each EBP has a “menu” of strategies from which communities can select and implement with a minimum of five strategies required: one for OEND, three for MOUD, and one for prescription opioid safety. Identification and engagement of high-risk populations in OEND and MOUD is an ORCCArequirement. To ensure CTH has community-wide impact, implementation of at least one EBP strategy is required in healthcare, behavioral health, and criminal justice settings, with communities identifying particular organizations to engage in HCS-facilitated EBP implementation.","Winhusen, Theresa; Walley, Alexander; Fanucchi, Laura C.; Hunt, Tim; Lyons, Mike; Lofwall, Michelle; Brown, Jennifer L.; Freeman, Patricia R.; Nunes, Edward; Beers, Donna; Saitz, Richard; Stambaugh, Leyla; Oga, Emmanuel; Herron, Nicole; Baker, Trevor; Cook, Christopher D.; Roberts, Monica F.; Alford, Daniel P.; Starrels, Joanna L.; Chandler, Redonna",Drug Alcohol Depend,255,1

However, the wearer's vigorous movements during cardiopulmonary resuscitation may affect the protective performance of the respirator. Herein, we aimed to assess the effects of chest compressions (CCs) on the protective performance of respirators. METHODS: This crossover study evaluated 30 healthcare providers from 1 emergency department who performed CC with real-time feedback. The first, second, and third groups started with a cup-type, fold-type, and valve-type respirator, respectively, after which the respirators were randomized for each group. The fit factors were measured using a quantitative fit testing device before and during the CC in each experiment. The protection rate was defined as the proportion of respirators achieving a fit factor ≥100. RESULTS: The fold-type respirator had a significantly greater protection rate at baseline (100.0% ± 0.0%) compared to the cup-type (73.6% ± 39.6%, P = .003) and valve-type respirators (87.5% ± 30.3%, P = .012). During the CC, the fit factor values significantly decreased for the cup-type (44.9% ± 42.8%, P < .001) and valve-type respirators (59.5% ± 41.7%, P = .002), but not for the fold-type respirator (93.2% ± 21.7%, P = .095). CONCLUSIONS: The protective performances of respirators may be influenced by CC. Healthcare providers should identify the respirator that provides the best fit for their intended tasks.","Shin, Hyungoo; Oh, Jaehoon; Lim, Tae Ho; Kang, Hyunggoo; Song, Yeongtak; Lee, Sanghyun",Medicine (Baltimore),255,10

Interestingly, severe COVID-19 is characterized by fever, hyperferritinemia, and a hyper-inflammatory process with a massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may be responsible for the high rate of mortality. These findings may advocate for a similarity between severe COVID-19 and some challenging rheumatic diseases, such as adult onset Still's disease, secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome, which have been included in the “hyperferritinemic syndrome” category. Furthermore, as performed in these hyper-inflammatory states, severe COVID-19 may benefit from immunomodulatory therapies.","Ruscitti, Piero; Berardicurti, Onorina; Di Benedetto, Paola; Cipriani, Paola; Iagnocco, Annamaria; Shoenfeld, Yehuda; Giacomelli, Roberto",Front Immunol,255,24

These are now in planning amid the ongoing rollout of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines globally. While traditional case-control (TCC) and test-negative design (TND) studies feature prominently among strategies used to assess vaccine effectiveness, such studies may encounter important threats to validity. Here we review the theoretical basis for estimation of vaccine direct effects under TCC and TND frameworks, addressing specific natural history parameters of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 relevant to these designs. Bias may be introduced by misclassification of cases and controls, particularly when clinical case criteria include common, non-specific indicators of COVID-19. When using diagnostic assays with high analytical sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection, individuals testing positive may be counted as cases even if their symptoms are due to other causes. The TCC may be particularly prone to confounding due to associations of vaccination with healthcare-seeking behavior or risk of infection. The TND reduces but may not eliminate this confounding, for instance if individuals who receive vaccination seek care or testing for less-severe infection. These circumstances indicate the two study designs cannot be applied naively to datasets gathered through public health surveillance or administrative sources. We suggest practical strategies to reduce bias in vaccine effectiveness estimates at the study design and analysis stages.","Lewnard, J. A.; Patel, M. M.; Jewell, N. P.; Verani, J.

Many therapeutic agents ranging widely between antivirals and anti-inflammatory drugs have been used to mitigate the disease burden. In the deluge of the drugs being used for COVID-19 infection, glucocorticoids (GCs) stand out by reducing mortality amongst in-hospital severe-to-critically ill patients. Health-care practitioners have seen this as a glimmer of hope and started using these drugs more frequently than ever in clinical practice. The fear of mortality in the short term has overridden the concern of adverse long-term consequences with steroid use. The ease of availability, low cost, and apparent clinical improvement in the short term have led to the unscrupulous use of the steroids even in mild COVID-19 patients including self-medication with steroids. The use of GCs has led to the increasing incidence of hyperglycemia and consequent acute complications of diabetic ketoacidosis and mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients. There is an urgent need to dissipate information about optimum management of hyperglycemia during steroid use. In view of this, the Endocrine Society of India has formulated this position statement about the diagnosis and management of hyperglycemia due to the use of GCs in patients with COVID-19 infection.","Das, Sambit; Rastogi, Ashu; Harikumar, K.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a layperson-delivered, empathy-focused program of telephone calls could rapidly improve loneliness, depression, and anxiety in at-risk adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From July 6 to September 24, 2020, we recruited and followed up 240 adults who were assigned to receive calls (intervention group) or no calls (control group) via block randomization. Loneliness, depression, and anxiety were measured using validated scales at enrollment and after 4 weeks. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted. Meals on Wheels Central Texas (MOWCTX) clients received calls in their homes or wherever they might have been when the call was received. The study included MOWCTX clients who fit their service criteria, including being homebound and expressing a need for food. A total of 296 participants were screened, of whom 240 were randomized to intervention or control. INTERVENTIONS: Sixteen callers, aged 17 to 23 years, were briefly trained in empathetic conversational techniques. Each called 6 to 9 participants over 4 weeks daily for the first 5 days, after which clients could choose to drop down to fewer calls but no less than 2 calls a week. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was loneliness (3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale, range 3-9; and 6-item De Jong Giervald Loneliness [De Jong] Scale, range 0-6). Secondary outcomes were depression (Personal Health Questionnaire for Depression), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), and self-rated health (Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire). RESULTS: The 240 participants were aged 27 to 101 years, with 63% aged at least 65 years (n = 149 of 232), 56% living alone (n = 135 of 240), 79% women (n = 190 of 240), 39% Black or African American (n = 94 of 240), and 22% Hispanic or Latino (n = 52 of 240), and all reported at least 1 chronic condition. Of 240 participants enrolled, 13 were lost to follow-up in the intervention arm and 1 in the control arm. Postassessment differences between intervention and control after 4 weeks showed an improvement of 1.1 on the UCLA Loneliness Scale (95% CI, 0.5-1.7; P < .001; Cohen d of 0.48), and improvement of 0.32 on De Jong (95% CI, −0.20 to 0.81; P = .06; Cohen d, 0.17) for loneliness; an improvement of 1.5 on the Personal Health Questionnaire for Depression (95% CI, 0.22-2.7; P < .001; Cohen d, 0.31) for depression; and an improvement of 1.8 on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (95% CI, 0.44 to 3.2; P < .001; Cohen d, 0.35) for anxiety. General physical health on the Short Form Health Questionnaire Survey showed no change, but mental health improved by 2.6 (95% CI, 0.81 to 4.4; P = .003; Cohen d of 0.46). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A layperson-delivered, empathy-oriented telephone call program reduced loneliness, depression, and anxiety compared with the control group and improved the general mental health of participants within 4 weeks.

The psychological impact of lockdown and working as a healthcare worker on the frontline has been chronicled in studies pertaining to previous infectious disease pandemics that have reported the presence of depressive symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Potentially linked to psychological well-being and not yet studied is the possibility that lockdown and working on the frontline of the pandemic are associated with perceptions of coercion. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The present study aimed to examine perceived coercion in those who have experienced COVID-19-related lockdown and/or worked as a frontline healthcare worker across three European countries. It aimed to describe how such perceptions may impact on psychological well-being, coping and post-traumatic growth. It will employ an explanatory mixed-methods research methodology consisting of an online survey and online asynchronous virtual focus groups (AVFGs) and individual interviews. χ(2) tests and analyses of variance will be used to examine whether participants from different countries differ according to demographic factors, whether there are differences between cohorts on perceived coercion, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic growth scores. The relationship between coercion and symptoms of distress will be assessed using multiple regression. Both the AVFGs and the narrative interviews will be analysed using thematic narrative analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by University College London’s Research Ethics Committee under Project ID Number 7335/004.

We describe how regular reflective rounds were designed and implemented within an existing educational program at a UK children's hospital and report on the feedback received from participants. METHODS: Eight face‐to‐face reflective rounds took place in Southampton Children's Hospital, UK, from September 2017 to February 2020 with a further virtual round in July 2020 during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Each round was facilitated by a clinical psychologist and consultant. For each round, up to three volunteer panellists from different staff groups were invited to share their personal experiences on a pre‐selected subject to the large group. The group would then contribute to the discussion by offering their own reflections. Feedback forms were distributed to attendees and collated. RESULTS: Eight rounds were held with mean attendance of 32 (range 19–47). Across the eight rounds, the total attendance was 256 staff members. The virtual round had 20 participants. Feedback was received from 202 participants. The majority (98%) would recommend the rounds to colleagues with 64 participants (32%) rating the rounds as ‘exceptional’ and 91 (45%) as ‘excellent’. The virtual round received similar positive feedback. CONCLUSION: Large group reflective practice can be implemented within an existing regular educational program. Rounds have been well received by participants and are likely to be of relevance and value to other healthcare groups. The rounds can also be delivered effectively virtually, which may increase participation.","Baker, Jonathan; Savage, Amy; Pendleton, Shannon; Bate, Jessica M",J Paediatr Child Health,255,16

All individuals of all age groups are at risk of COVID‐19. This study aims to describe the knowledge and attitude of Jordanian parents regarding COVID‐19 in children, including clinical signs of the disease, modes of transmission and protection measures. METHOD: A cross‐section study among Jordanian parents was conducted. The size of the sample was 810. Information regarding the clinical signs of the disease, modes of transmission, protection measures against COVID‐19 and satisfaction with governmental measures was collected. RESULTS: The findings indicate that the parents had a good understanding of the clinical signs, mode of transmission and protection measures and were satisfied with governmental measures. According to the parents’ responses, the resource they used the most about COVID‐19 was social media (78%), followed by news channels. Many correctly stated that fever was a clinical sign, followed by cough (77%). Almost 90% of the parents have an appropriate attitude towards companioning children within crowds. Generally, people are more susceptible to the virus within crowds. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we believe that the findings reported here are important for understanding the clinical characteristics and vertical transmission potential of COVID‐19 infection in children, from the perspective of parents. The knowledge of parents about COVID‐19 in children was considered good in the case of most parents. This knowledge helps with creating educational programs to increase awareness for areas that have weaknesses.","Abuhammad, Sawsan",Int J Clin Pract,255,16

Naturally, different possibilities (including herbal medicines having known therapeutic significance) have been explored by the scientists. The systematic scientific study (beginning with in silico study) of herbal medicines in particular and any drug in general is now possible as the structural components (proteins) of COVID-19 are already characterized. The main protease of COVID-19 virus is M(pro) or 3CL(pro) which is a key CoV enzyme and an attractive drug target as it plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription. In the present study, 3CL(pro) is used to study drug:3CL(pro) interactions and thus to investigate whether all or any of the main chemical constituents of Tinospora cordifolia (e.g. berberine (C(20)H(18)NO(4)), β-sitosterol (C(29)H(50)O), coline (C(5)H(14)NO), tetrahydropalmatine (C(21)H(25)NO(4)) and octacosanol (C(28)H(58)O)) can be used as an anti-viral drug against SARS-CoV-2. The in silico study performed using tools of network pharmacology, molecular docking including molecular dynamics have revealed that among all considered phytochemicals in Tinospora cordifolia, berberine can regulate 3CL(pro) protein's function due to its easy inhibition and thus can control viral replication. The selection of Tinospora cordifolia was motivated by the fact that the main constituents of it are known to be responsible for various antiviral activities and the treatment of jaundice, rheumatism, diabetes, etc. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted to control it provide a natural experiment to investigate the links between nature exposure and mental health under extreme conditions. Using a survey distributed online, we tested the following hypotheses: 1) People will show greater symptoms of depression and anxiety under lockdown conditions that did not allow contact with outdoor nature spaces; 2) Where access to public outdoor nature spaces was strictly restricted, (2a) those with green/blue nature view or (2b) access to private outdoor spaces such as a garden or balcony will show fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety, and a more positive mood. Based on 5,218 responses from 9 countries, we found that lockdown severity significantly affected mental health, while contact with nature helped people to cope with these impacts, especially for those under strict lockdown. People under strict lockdown in Spain (3,403 responses), perceived that nature helped them to cope with lockdown measures; and emotions were more positive among individuals with accessible outdoor spaces and blue-green elements in their views. These findings can help decision-makers in developing potential future lockdown measures to mitigate the negative impacts, helping people to be more resilient and maintain better mental health, using the benefits that ecosystem services are providing us.","Pouso, Sarai; Borja, Ángel; Fleming, Lora E.; Gómez-Baggethun, Erik; White, Mathew P.; Uyarra, María C.",Sci Total Environ,255,20

A total of 62 European cardiologists as authors and 29 further experts as reviewers have contributed to this 119-page document. The emphasis of the guidelines is on a cautious strategy in dealing with a pandemic, which is still characterized by many unknown factors. It is consciously limited to cardiovascular diseases. In the last update from 10 June 2020 many practical instructions for cardiovascular diagnostics and treatment under the conditions of a pandemic are given. These recommendations largely depend on the already well-known guidelines of the ESC. To recapitulate them might be helpful but much is redundant. The sections on the pathophysiology and pathomechanisms by which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could specifically affect the cardiovascular system, are informative but sometimes in need of supplementation. It is counterproductive to recommend that pathohistological and molecular investigations of tissues from affected and deceased patients should be avoided.

Markers of disease activity like ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and D-dimers are frequently monitored to detect the best opportunity for intensive treatment. METHODS: All patients of >18 years of age were included. The primary variables of interest, ferritin, CRP, and D-dimers, for each patient throughout hospitalization were recorded. Primary clinical outcomes of length of stay in ICU and survival were recorded. DEMOGRAPHICS: age, gender, BMI, and nationality. Ferritin, CRP, and D-dimers were recorded daily if available for the whole ICU stay, and all other variables were recorded on admission day to ICU. RESULTS: The sample includes 235 records. More than 95% of patients have all markers on the day of admission to ICU were ferritin (median 1,278; IQR 1,424), D-dimer 1.21 (3.4), and CRP 129.5 (121). Daily average levels of markers were different from their admission day level: ferritin 1,395 (1,331), D-dimer 3.11 (5.52), and CRP 107 (75.8). Multiple logistic regression analysis determined that average CRP during the stay was the only predictor of survival. DISCUSSION: Data on markers utilization to detect the acute phase of inflammation help clinicians focus on the opportunity window for intensive treatment. CONCLUSION: Average CRP during the stay in ICU is higher than CRP on admission. Average CRP is the only factor that predicts survival.","Nadeem, Rashid; Elhoufi, Ashraf Mahmoud; Iqbal, Naheed Elahi; Obaida, Zainab Abdulameer; Elgohary, Doaa Mohamed; Singh, Mukesh Kumar; Zoraey, Shymaa Farouk; Abdalla, Rami M.; Eltayeb, Sara Yousif; Danthi, Crystal Sharon; Azaza, Nouha; Ahmed, Waleed Mohamed; Hafeez, Muzammil; AlSada, Maryam; Mir, Fatima Farid",Dubai Medical Journal,255,11

O-GlcNAcylation of MAVS, a down-stream target of MDA5, renders it more effective for type 1 interferon induction. High-dose glucosamine administration up-regulates O-GlcNAcylation by increasing the cellular pool of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine.

METHODS: Authors emailed a cross-sectional survey in April-May, 2020 to students in clinical training years at six US medical schools which included validated General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Primary Care-PTSD (PC-PTSD-5) screening tools, and asked students about pandemic-related stress and specific concerns. Authors used quantitative and thematic analysis to present results. RESULTS: Of 2511 eligible students, 741 responded (29.5%). Most students (84.1%) reported at least “somewhat” increased levels of stress and anxiety related to the pandemic. On the GAD-7, 34.3% showed mild, 16.1% moderate, and 9.5% severe anxiety symptoms, with 39.6% demonstrating no/minimal symptoms. One quarter (25.4%) screened positive for PTSD risk symptoms. Top concerns of students chosen from a pre-populated list included inadequate COVID-19 testing, undiagnosed or asymptomatic spread and racial or other disparities in the pandemic. In thematic analysis, students’ reactions to removal from clinical learning included: understanding the need to conserve PPE (32.2%), a desire to help (27.7%), worry over infectious risk to others (25.4%) and self (21.2%), and lost learning opportunities (22.5%). Female students were significantly more likely to report anxiety and PTSD risk symptoms. Asian students had a greater risk of moderate anxiety and those underrepresented in medicine (UIM) had greater risk of moderate and severe anxiety symptoms compared to white students. CONCLUSIONS: During the initial peak phase of COVID-19, over 60% of US medical students screened positive for pandemic-related anxiety and one quarter were at risk for PTSD. Female and UIM students were significantly more affected. Medical schools should consider broad support of students, and targeted outreach to female and UIM students.","Lee, Carmen M.; Juarez, Marianne; Rae, Guenevere; Jones, Lee; Rodriguez, Robert M.; Davis, John A.; Boysen-Osborn, Megan; Kashima, Kathleen J.; Krane, N.

Monitoring of molecular markers conferring resistance to different antimalarials is important to track the spread of resistant parasites and to optimize the therapeutic lifespan of current drugs. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of known mutations in the drug resistance genes Pfcrt, Pfmdr1, Pfdhfr and Pfdhps in two different epidemiological settings in Cameroon. Dried blood spots collected in 2018 and 2019 from asymptomatic individuals were used for DNA extraction and then the Plasmodium infection status was determined byPCR. Detection of SNPs was performed by nested PCR followed by allele-specific restriction analysis (ASRA). The prevalence of each genotype was compared between sites using the Chi square and Fisher’s exact tests. A high prevalence of the Pfcrt K76 wild type allele was found in both sites (88.5 and 62.29% respectively; P< 0,0001). The prevalence of Pfmdr1 mutations 86Y and 1246Y was respectively 55.83 and 1.45% in Mfou and 45.87 and 5.97% in Tibati, with significant difference between the studied areas (P<0.0001). Overall, the Pfdhfr triple-mutant genotype (51I/59R/108N) was highly prevalent (> 96%), however no SNP was detected at codon 164. In Pfdhps, the prevalence of the 437G mutation reached (90%) and was at higher frequency in Mfou (P< 0.0001). Overall, the Pfdhps mutations 540E and 581G were less common (0.33 and 3.26%, respectively). The quadruple resistant genotype (Pfdhfr 51I/59R/108N+Pfdhp437G) was found almost 90% of the samples. The wild-type genotype (Pfdhfr N51/C59/S108/164I+Pfdhps A437/K540/A581) was never identified and the sextuple mutant (Pfdhfr 51I/59R/108N+Pfdhp437G/540E/581G), kwon as super resistant appeared in two samples from Tibati. These findings demonstrate declining trends in the prevalence of mutations conferring resistance to 4-aminoquinolines, especially to chloroquine.

Although the primary triggering factors of ITP remain unknown, a loss of immune tolerance—mostly represented by a regulatory T-cell defect—allows T follicular helper cells to stimulate autoreactive splenic B cells that differentiate into antiplatelet antibody-producing plasma cells. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa is the main target of antiplatelet antibodies leading to platelet phagocytosis by splenic macrophages, through interactions with Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) and complement receptors. This allows macrophages to activate autoreactive T cells by their antigen-presenting functions. Moreover, the activation of the classical complement pathway participates to platelet opsonization and also to their destruction by complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Platelet destruction is also mediated by a FcγR-independent pathway, involving platelet desialylation that favors their binding to the Ashwell-Morell receptor and their clearance in the liver. Cytotoxic T cells also contribute to ITP pathogenesis by mediating cytotoxicity against megakaryocytes and peripheral platelets. The deficient megakaryopoiesis resulting from both the humoral and the cytotoxic immune responses is sustained by inappropriate levels of thrombopoietin, the major growth factor of megakaryocytes. The better understanding of ITP pathogenesis has provided important therapeutic advances. B cell-targeting therapies and thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) have been used for years. New emerging therapeutic strategies that inhibit FcγR signaling, the neonatal Fc receptor or the classical complement pathway, will deeply modify the management of ITP in the near future.","Audia, Sylvain; Mahévas, Matthieu; Nivet, Martin; Ouandji, Sethi; Ciudad, Marion; Bonnotte, Bernard",Hemasphere,255,16

Epithelial-immune cell interactions and elevated cytokine and chemokine levels, i.e. cytokine storm, seem to play a central role in severity and lethality in COVID-19. The present perspective places a central cellular pro-inflammatory signal pathway, NF-κB, in the context of recently published data for COVID-19 and provides a hypothesis for a therapeutic approach aiming at the simultaneous inhibition of whole cascades of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The simultaneous inhibition of multiple cytokines/chemokines is expected to have much higher therapeutic potential as compared to single target approaches to prevent cascade (i.e. redundant, triggering, amplifying, and synergistic) effects of multiple induced cytokines and chemokines in critical stage COVID-19 patients.","Kircheis, Ralf; Haasbach, Emanuel; Lueftenegger, Daniel; Heyken, Willm T.; Ocker, Matthias; Planz, Oliver",Front Immunol,255,7

The limitations to high-level expression of active viral surface glycoproteins in yeast are not well understood. To identify possible bottlenecks we performed a detailed study on overexpression of recombinant mumps hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (MuHN) and measles hemagglutinin (MeH) in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, combining the analysis of recombinant proteins with a proteomic approach. RESULTS: Overexpressed recombinant MuHN and MeH proteins were present in large aggregates, were inactive and totally insoluble under native conditions. Moreover, the majority of recombinant protein was found in immature form of non-glycosylated precursors. Fractionation of yeast lysates revealed that the core of viral surface protein aggregates consists of MuHN or MeH disulfide-linked multimers involving eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) and is closely associated with small heat shock proteins (sHsps) that can be removed only under denaturing conditions. Complexes of large Hsps seem to be bound to aggregate core peripherally as they can be easily removed at high salt concentrations. Proteomic analysis revealed that the accumulation of unglycosylated viral protein precursors results in specific cytosolic unfolded protein response (UPR-Cyto) in yeast cells, characterized by different action and regulation of small Hsps versus large chaperones of Hsp70, Hsp90 and Hsp110 families. In contrast to most environmental stresses, in the response to synthesis of recombinant MuHN and MeH, only the large Hsps were upregulated whereas sHsps were not. Interestingly, the amount of eEF1A was also increased during this stress response. CONCLUSIONS: Inefficient translocation of MuHN and MeH precursors through ER membrane is a bottleneck for high-level expression in yeast. Overexpression of these recombinant proteins induces the UPR's cytosolic counterpart, the UPR-Cyto, which represent a subset of proteins involved in the heat-shock response. The involvement of eEF1A may explain the mechanism by which only large chaperones, but not small Hsps are upregulated during this stress response. Our study highlights important differences between viral surface protein expression in yeast and mammalian cells at the first stage of secretory pathway.","Čiplys, Evaldas; Samuel, Dhanraj; Juozapaitis, Mindaugas; Sasnauskas, Kęstutis; Slibinskas, Rimantas",Microb Cell Fact,255,24

Such risks, along with other socioeconomic and development trends, will affect cause-of-death patterns experienced in the coming decades. This study explores future mortality trends using the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) framework, a widely utilized tool for understanding socioeconomic development trends in a world with climate change. Existing projections for GDP, urbanization, and demographic trends based on SSP narratives are incorporated into an integrated assessment model, International Futures (IFs), in order to project mortality levels by cause of death for all countries from 2020 to 2100. Under more optimistic SSPs, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) rise as a proportion of all deaths, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, while more pessimistic SSPs suggest a continued high burden of largely preventable communicable diseases. In high-income countries, significant continued burdens of NCDs are projected for the remainder of the century under all SSPs. Comparisons are also made to recent cause-of-death projections from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) to assess how the IFs and IHME models vary.

Social and environmental concerns have entered Amazonian discourses and policies only since the 1990s. Since then, reports of threats to forests and indigenous people have alternated with reports of socio-economic progress and environmental achievements. These contradictions often arise from limited thematic, sectoral, temporal, or spatial perspectives, and lead to misinterpretation. Our paper offers a comprehensive picture of discourses, policies, and socio-environmental dynamics for the entire region over the last five decades. We distinguish eight historical policy phases, each of which had little effect on near-linear dynamics of demographic growth and land-use expansion, although some policies showed the potential to change the course of development. To prevent local, national, and international actors from continuing to assert harmful interests in the region, a coherent long-term commitment and change in the collective mindset are needed.","Pokorny, Benno; Pacheco, Pablo; de Jong, Wil; Entenmann, Steffen Karl",Ambio,255,24

Increased worry is also likely considering the substantial financial, educational and health concerns accompanying COVID-19. White matter (WM) integrity has been shown to be associated with anxiety and depression symptoms, including worry, as well being closely associated with sleep quality. This study aimed to investigate the associations between pre-COVID sleep quality, WM structural integrity and levels of worry and rumination about COVID. METHODS: N = 30 adolescent participants from Queensland, Australia, completed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scanning pre-COVID, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) pre and during COVID, and 9 items designed to measure 3 constructs, perceived impact of COVID, general worry, and COVID-specific worry and rumination. RESULTS: Sleep quality (PSQI total) was significantly poorer during COVID compared with pre-COVID. Sleep onset latency measured pre-COVID was significantly associated with COVID-specific worry and rumination. While the structural integrity of a number of WM tracts (measured pre-COVID) were found to be significantly associated with COVID-specific worry and rumination. Follow-up regression analysis using a model including pre-COVID sleep onset latency, structural integrity of the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC), gender and change in PSQI explained a significant 47% of the variance in COVID-specific worry and rumination. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that adolescents with poor sleep quality and perturbed WM integrity may be at risk of heightened reactivity to future stressful events and interventions should focus on improving sleep onset latency.","Jamieson, Daniel; Kannis-Dymand, Lee; Beaudequin, Denise A.; Schwenn, Paul; Shan, Zack; McLoughlin, Larisa T.; Lagopoulos, Jim; Hermens, Daniel F.",J Adolesc,255,1

For example, families must interpret inconsistent media and public health messages about COVID-19, which may in turn have implications for health risk behavior. Adding to this complexity, household structures and routines are adapting in response to COVID-19. Adult family members in some families may suddenly experience extreme physical proximity, while others must coordinate to make decisions about their health and prevention behaviors while maintaining physical distance. Furthermore, members of these families must balance relational maintenance while communicating to assess and avoid health risks. The ongoing ambiguity of information about COVID-19 means that these relational processes must be managed in the midst of chronic uncertainty. The current study uses semistructured interviews and interpretive analysis to understand how adult children (aged 23-51 years) manage chronic uncertainty about COVID-19 in communication with their parents. Findings explore themes of navigating information about COVID-19 risks and protections, managing uncertainty management about media and political messages, and accepting time-related uncertainties.","Hernandez, Rachael A.; Colaner, Colleen",Am Behav Sci,255,33

However, using these models in medical computer vision tasks suffers from several limitations, viz., (i) adapting to visual characteristics that are unlike natural images; (ii) modeling random noise during training due to stochastic optimization and backpropagation-based learning strategy; (iii) challenges in explaining DL black-box behavior to support clinical decision-making; and (iv) inter-reader variability in the ground truth (GT) annotations affecting learning and evaluation. This study proposes a systematic approach to address these limitations for COVID-19 detection using chest X-rays (CXRs). Specifically, our contribution benefits from (i) pretraining specific to CXRs in transferring and fine-tuning the learned knowledge toward improving COVID-19 detection performance; (ii) using ensembles of the fine-tuned models to further improve performance compared to individual constituent models; (iii) performing statistical analyses at various learning stages to validate our claims; (iv) interpreting learned individual and ensemble model behavior through class-selective relevance mapping (CRM)-based region of interest (ROI) localization; (v) analyzing inter-reader variability and ensemble localization performance using Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) methods. We observe that: (i) ensemble approaches improved classification and localization performance; and, (ii) inter-reader variability and performance level assessment helped guide algorithm design and parameter optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to construct ensembles, perform ensemble-based disease ROI localization, and analyze inter-reader variability and algorithm performance for COVID-19 detection in CXRs.","Rajaraman, S.; Sornapudi, S.; Alderson, P.

We assessed pathways by which SARS-CoV-2 could access the placenta. Placentae, from PTB with or without chorioamnionitis (ChA), or from term pregnancies (n = 12/13/group) were collected. Peripheral blood was collected from healthy pregnant women (n = 6). Second trimester placental explants (16–20 weeks, n = 5/group) were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, to mimic bacterial infection) and ACE2, CCL2, IL-6/8 and TNFα mRNA was assessed. ChA-placentae exhibited increased ACE2 and CCL2 mRNA expression (p < 0.05). LPS increased cytokine and ACE2 mRNA in placental explants. Placental ACE2 protein localized to syncytiotrophoblast, fetal endothelium, extravillous trophoblast and in immune cells-subsets (M1/M2 macrophage and neutrophils) within the villous stroma. Significantly increased numbers of M1 macrophage and neutrophils were present in the ChA-placenta (p < 0.001). Subsets of peripheral immune cells from pregnant women express the ACE2 mRNA and protein. A greater fraction of granulocytes was positive for ACE2 protein expression compared to lymphocytes or monocytes. These data suggest that in pregnancies complicated by ChA, ACE2 positive immune cells in the maternal circulation have the potential to traffic SARS-CoV-2 virus to the placenta and increase the risk of vertical transmission to the placenta/fetus.","Lye, Phetcharawan; Dunk, Caroline E.; Zhang, Jianhong; Wei, Yanxing; Nakpu, Jittanan; Hamada, Hirotaka; Imperio, Guinever E.; Bloise, Enrrico; Matthews, Stephen G.; Lye, Stephen J.",Cells,255,16

Objective: To evaluate the clinical usefulness and psychometric properties of the COVID-19 Yorkshire Rehabilitation Scale (C19-YRS) in patients with PCS. Design: A prospective, observational study of 187 consecutive patients attending a post-COVID-19 rehabilitation clinic. The C19-YRS was used to record patients' symptoms, functioning and disability. A global health question was used to measure the overall impact of PCS on health. Classical psychometric methods (data quality, scaling assumptions, targeting, reliability and validity) were used to assess the C19-YRS. Results: For the overall scale, missing data were low, scaling and targeting assumptions were satisfied, and internal consistency was high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.891). Relationships between perception of health and patients' reports of symptoms, functioning and disability demonstrated good concordance. Conclusions: This is the first study to examine the psychometric properties of an outcome measure in patients with PCS. In this sample of patients, the C19-YRS was clinically useful and satisfied standard psychometric criteria, providing preliminary evidence of its suitability as a measure of PCS.","Preston, N.

Consequently, the design of these urban environments requires new approaches. It is our view that Human Factors and Ergonomics approaches can be used to provide these insights. This article explores the opportunities for making public spaces safer and more accessible for community use under pandemic conditions. The study utilizes a sociotechnical systems model of an archetype public space, developed pre‐COVID‐19, to explore the infrastructure and activities that are impacted by the introduction of the virus to the public space system. The aim was to identify those elements of the system that are completely unavailable under pandemic conditions, those elements that become limited in use, and those which remained unaffected by the presence of the virus. The findings show that under pandemic conditions pre‐COVID‐19 public spaces were surprisingly resilient with proportionally few elements within the model completely unavailable. They also demonstrate that overall, the public spaces system, while still operating, is significantly constrained in achieving and optimizing community and individual health and well‐being. The insertion of five (5) urban design interventions within the system model presented unique insights into the possibilities for optimizing adaptive capacity. These interventions revealed design opportunities across several levels of the systems model. Such insights are argued to assist in not only re‐establishing community access under pandemic conditions but also more inclusive access to a broader range of the community under all conditions.","Stevens, Nicholas J.; Tavares, Silvia G.; Salmon, Paul M.",Hum Factors Ergon Manuf,255,1

In response, the National Health Service (NHS) in England has been working since 2008 to quantify and reduce its carbon footprint. This Article presents the latest update to its greenhouse gas accounting, identifying interventions for mitigation efforts and describing an approach applicable to other health systems across the world. METHODS: A hybrid model was used to quantify emissions within Scopes 1, 2, and 3 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, as well as patient and visitor travel emissions, from 1990 to 2019. This approach complements the broad coverage of top-down economic modelling with the high accuracy of bottom-up data wherever available. Available data were backcasted or forecasted to cover all years. To enable the identification of measures to reduce carbon emissions, results were disaggregated by organisation type. FINDINGS: In 2019, the health service's emissions totalled 25 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, a reduction of 26% since 1990, and a decrease of 64% in the emissions per inpatient finished admission episode. Of the 2019 footprint, 62% came from the supply chain, 24% from the direct delivery of care, 10% from staff commute and patient and visitor travel, and 4% from private health and care services commissioned by the NHS. INTERPRETATION: This work represents the longest and most comprehensive accounting of national health-care emissions globally, and underscores the importance of incorporating bottom-up data to improve the accuracy of top-down modelling and enabling detailed monitoring of progress as health systems act to reduce emissions.

Some patients required Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. The use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in these patients is controversial, as the aerosol dispersion may contaminate the environment and health-care co-workers. METHODS: Describe the respiratory profile, the mortality rate, and the benefit of using NIV in patients with confirmed diagnosis of influenza AH1N1 who were admitted in the ICU during the year 2009. RESULTS: A total of 1, 401 cases of influenza A H1N1 were confirmed in our hospital by real-time RT-PCR in 2009, and 20 patients were admitted to the ICU. The patients' ages ranged from 18 to 74 years (median of 42). Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) was present in 70% of patients. The median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 7 (range 7 to 25). Of the 14 patients who developed ARF, 85.7% needed NIV and 14% needed invasive MV at admission. Our success rate (41.6%) with NIV was higher than that described by others. The hospital mortality rate was 2.1%. When influenza A H1N1 arrived in Brazil, the disease was already on endemic alert in other countries. The population was already aware of the symptoms and the health-care system of the treatment. This allowed patients to be properly and promptly treated for influenza A H1N1, while health-care workers took protective measures to avoid contamination.

To assess the motor and mental health changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemics in Cuban patients with cerebellar ataxias, three hundred four patients with cerebellar ataxias and 167 healthy controls were interviewed for risks of exposure to COVID-19, and the self-perception of the pandemics’ impact on the disease progression and on the mental health. All subjects underwent the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The patients reported low exposition to SARS-CoV2 infection, but one case was confirmed with a mild COVID-19. Overall, depressive and anxiety symptoms were significantly and marginally increased in patients, respectively, with higher scores in cases with severe and moderate ataxia. Positive patient’s impression of psychopathological changes was associated to increased age, age at onset, and anxiety. Sixty-seven patients had a positive self-perception of ataxia progression, which was mainly influenced by higher anxiety scores but not by the adherence to at-home exercise programs. However, the practice of physical exercise was related with lower depression and anxiety scores, but this therapeutical effect was not significantly influenced by the disease stage. We demonstrated the negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental and motor deficits in Cuban patients with cerebellar ataxias and the positive effect of the at-home physical exercise programs on their mental well-being.

According to this hypothesis, these agents have capacity to evade the host immune system leading to chronic infection, inflammation, and subsequent deposition of Aβ and phosphorylated-tau in the brain. Co-existing proteinopathies and age-related pathologies are common in AD and the brains of elderly individuals, but whether these are also related to neuroinfections remain to be established. This study determined the prevalence and distribution of neurodegenerative proteinopathies in patients with infection-induced acute or chronic inflammation associated with herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis (n = 13) and neurosyphilis (n = 23). The mean age at death in HSV patients was 53 ± 12 years (range 24–65 years) and survival was 9 days–6 years following initial infection. The mean age at death and survival in neurosyphilis patients was 60 ± 15 years (range 36–86 years) and 1–5 years, respectively. Neuronal tau-immunoreactivity and neurites were observed in 8 HSV patients and 19 neurosyphilis patients, and in approximately half of these, this was found in regions associated with inflammation and expanding beyond regions expected from the Braak stage of neurofibrillary degeneration. Five neurosyphilis patients had cortical ageing-related tau astrogliopathy. Aβ-plaques were found in 4 HSV patients and 11 neurosyphilis patients.

In vitro experiments showed that the truncated protein produced by the rs12252 C allele exhibited an impaired anti-HTNV activity. We also proved that IFITM3 was able to inhibit HTNV infection in both HUVEC and A549 cells by overexpression and RNAi assays, likely via a mechanism of inhibiting virus entry demonstrated by binding and entry assay. Localization of IFITM3 in late endosomes was also observed. In addition, we demonstrated that the transcription of IFITM3 is negatively regulated by an lncRNA negative regulator of interferon response (NRIR).

Unlike envelope glycoproteins of other viruses, the transmembrane glycoprotein El is glycosylated normally in the presence of tunicamycin. This suggests that glycosylation of El does not involve transfer of core oligosaccharides from dolichol pyrophosphate intermediates to asparagine residues, but may occur by 0-linked glycosylation of serine or threonine residues. Synthesis of the peplomeric glycoprotein E2 is not readily detectable in the presence of tunicamycin. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation of E2 by tunicamycin either prevents synthesis or facilitates degradation of the protein moiety of E2. Radiolabeling with carbohydrate precursors and borate gel electrophoresis of glycopeptides show that different oligcsaccharide side chains are attached to El and E2. The two coronavirus envelope glycoproteins thus appear to be glycosylated by different mechanisms. In tunicamycin-treated cells, noninfectious virions lacking peplomers are formed at intracytoplasmic membranes and released from the cells. These virions contain normal amounts of nucleocapsid protein and glycosylated El, but lack E2. Thus the transmembrane glycoprotein El is the only viral glycoprotein required for the formation of the viral envelope or for virus maturation and release. The peplomeric glycoprotein E2 appears to be required for attachment to virus receptors on the plasma membrane. The coronavirus envelope envelope glycoprotein E1 appears to be a novel type of viral glycoprotein which is post-translationally glycosylated by a tunicamycin-resistant process that yields oligosaccharide side chains different from those of N-linked glycoproteins. These findings suggest that El may be particularly useful as a model for studying the biosynthesis, glycosylation, and intracellular transport of 0-linked glycoproteins.","Holmes, Kathryn V.; Doller, Elizabeth W.; Sturman, Lawrence S.",Virology,255,16

Therefore, we encourage stakeholders to provide real-time data about the characteristics of recruited participants, including clearly identifiable subgroups, like cancer patients, with sample sizes large enough to determine safety and efficacy. Moreover, we envisage a prompt implementation of suitable registries for pharmacovigilance reporting, in order to monitor the effects of COVID-19 vaccines and immunization rates in patients with cancer. That said, data extrapolation from other vaccines trials (e.g. anti-influenza virus), showed a favorable safety and efficacy profile for cancer patients. On the basis of the evidence discussed, we believe that the benefits of the vaccination outweigh the risks. Consequently, healthcare authorities should prioritize vaccinations for cancer patients, with time-point of administration agreed on a case-by-case basis. In this regard, the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the European Society of Medical Oncology are advocating for cancer patients a high priority status, in the hope of attenuating the consequences of the pandemic in this particularly vulnerable population.","Corti, Chiara; Crimini, Edoardo; Tarantino, Paolo; Pravettoni, Gabriella; Eggermont, Alexander M.M.; Delaloge, Suzette; Curigliano, Giuseppe",Eur J Cancer,255,25

While crucial to control the pandemic, isolation might have a significant impact on productivity and mental health. Especially for researchers working in healthcare, the current situation is complex. We therefore carried out a survey amongst researchers in the field of radiation oncology to gain insights on the impact of social isolation and working from home and to guide future work. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey was conducted between March 27(th) and April 5(th), 2020. The first part contained 14 questions intended to capture an overview of the specific aspects related to research while in isolation. The second (optional) part of the questionnaire was the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a self-reported measure used to assess levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: From 543 survey participants, 48.8% reported to work full-time from home. The impact on perceived productivity, with 71.2% of participants feeling less productive, caused 58% of participants to feel some level of guilt. Compared to normative data, relatively high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were recorded for the 335 participants who filled out the HADS questionnaire. Group comparisons found the presence of a supportive institutional program as the sole factor of statistical significance in both anxiety and depressive symptom levels. People having to work full-time on location showed higher depressive symptom levels than those working from home. Anxiety scores were negatively correlated with the number of research years. CONCLUSION: Results of the survey showed there is a non-negligible impact on both productivity and mental health. As the radiation oncology research community was forced to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, lessons can be learned to face future adverse situations but also to improve work-life balance in general.","Dhont, Jennifer; Di Tella, Marialaura; Dubois, Ludwig; Aznar, Marianne; Petit, Steven; Spałek, Mateusz; Boldrini, Luca; Franco, Pierfrancesco; Bertholet, Jenny",Clin Transl Radiat Oncol,255,29

We aimed to increase the utilization of video visits for pediatric patients at our medical center using an iterative quality improvement process. METHODS: A multispecialty improvement team identified opportunities to increase video visit utilization and prioritized interventions using benefit-effort analyses. Interventions focused on 6 key drivers. The outcome measure was the percentage of ambulatory encounters conducted by video. The process measure was the percentage of ambulatory pediatricians conducting video visits. The balancing measure was the percentage of no-shows among scheduled video visits. All measures were analyzed using statistical process control. RESULTS: Interventions were associated with increases in our outcome and process measures from 0.1% to 1.2% and 0.6% to 6.3%, respectively, during the first 8 months. Subsequently, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic was associated with further increases in these measures to 41.8% and 73.5%, respectively, over 3 months. The balancing measure increased from 0% at baseline to 14.7% with no special cause variation during the intervention period. The most impactful interventions included clinician training outreach, providing equipment, and streamlining MyChart patient enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: This improvement project effectively increased pediatric ambulatory video visit utilization, although the most significant driver of utilization was the COVID-19 pandemic. Project interventions implemented before COVID-19 facilitated rapid video visit adoption during the pandemic. A similar improvement process may be beneficial for other medical centers aiming to improve video visit utilization.","Rosenthal, Jennifer L.; Sigal, Ilana S.; Kamerman-Kretzmer, Rory; Say, Daphne S.; Castellanos, Bianca; Nguyen, Stephanie; Nakra, Natasha A.; Restrepo, Bibiana; Crossen, Stephanie S.",Pediatr Qual Saf,255,1

Among these alternatives is collection of nasal-swab samples, which can be performed by the patient, avoiding the need for healthcare personnel and personal protective equipment. Previous studies have reached opposing conclusions regarding whether nasal sampling is concordant or discordant with NP. To resolve this disagreement, we compared nasal and NP specimens collected by healthcare workers in a cohort consisting of individuals clinically suspected of COVID-19 and outpatients known to be SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive undergoing follow-up. We investigated three different transport conditions, including traditional viral transport media (VTM) and dry swabs, for each of two different nasal-swab collection protocols on a total of 308 study participants, and compared categorical results and Ct values to those from standard NP swabs collected at the same time from the same patients. All testing was performed by RT-PCR on the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 RealTime EUA (limit of detection [LoD], 100 copies viral genomic RNA/mL transport medium). We found high concordance (Cohen’s kappa >0.8) only for patients with viral loads above 1,000 copies/mL. Those with viral loads below 1,000 copies/mL, the majority in our cohort, exhibited low concordance (Cohen’s kappa = 0.49); most of these would have been missed by nasal testing alone. Previous reports of high concordance may have resulted from use of assays with higher LoD (≥1,000 copies/mL). These findings counsel caution in use of nasal testing in healthcare settings and contact-tracing efforts, as opposed to screening of asymptomatic, low-prevalence, low-risk populations. Nasal testing is an adjunct, not a replacement, for NP.","Callahan, Cody; Lee, Rose A.; Lee, Ghee Rye; Zulauf, Kate; Kirby, James E.; Arnaout, Ramy",medRxiv,255,1

Delays in decompensation recognition are associated with worse outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to predict acute respiratory failure requiring any advanced respiratory support (including noninvasive ventilation). With the advent of the coronavirus disease pandemic, concern regarding acute respiratory failure has increased. DERIVATION COHORT: All admission encounters from January 2014 to June 2017 from three hospitals in the Emory Healthcare network (82,699). VALIDATION COHORT: External validation cohort: all admission encounters from January 2014 to June 2017 from a fourth hospital in the Emory Healthcare network (40,143). Temporal validation cohort: all admission encounters from February to April 2020 from four hospitals in the Emory Healthcare network coronavirus disease tested (2,564) and coronavirus disease positive (389). PREDICTION MODEL: All admission encounters had vital signs, laboratory, and demographic data extracted. Exclusion criteria included invasive mechanical ventilation started within the operating room or advanced respiratory support within the first 8 hours of admission. Encounters were discretized into hour intervals from 8 hours after admission to discharge or advanced respiratory support initiation and binary labeled for advanced respiratory support. Prediction of Acute Respiratory Failure requiring advanced respiratory support in Advance of Interventions and Treatment, our eXtreme Gradient Boosting-based algorithm, was compared against Modified Early Warning Score. RESULTS: Prediction of Acute Respiratory Failure requiring advanced respiratory support in Advance of Interventions and Treatment had significantly better discrimination than Modified Early Warning Score (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.85 vs 0.57 [test], 0.84 vs 0.61 [external validation]). Prediction of Acute Respiratory Failure requiring advanced respiratory support in Advance of Interventions and Treatment maintained a positive predictive value (0.31–0.21) similar to that of Modified Early Warning Score greater than 4 (0.29–0.25) while identifying 6.62 (validation) to 9.58 (test) times more true positives. Furthermore, Prediction of Acute Respiratory Failure requiring advanced respiratory support in Advance of Interventions and Treatment performed more effectively in temporal validation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.86 [coronavirus disease tested], 0.93 [coronavirus disease positive]), while achieving identifying 4.25–4.51× more true positives. CONCLUSIONS: Prediction of Acute Respiratory Failure requiring advanced respiratory support in Advance of Interventions and Treatment is more effective than Modified Early Warning Score in predicting respiratory failure requiring advanced respiratory support at external validation and in coronavirus disease 2019 patients.

Discriminating different chicken breeds based on their phenotypic characteristics is one strategy to avoid chicken adulteration. The main objective of this study was to authenticate and group dominant chicken breeds in Malaysia, including commercial chickens (Cobb, Hubbard, DeKalb) and cross-bred village chickens (Ayam Kampung, Akar Putra). The further discrimination of village chickens from underaged colored broilers (UCBs) (Hubbard, Sasso) was performed based on phenotype traits. The results showed that the breed had a significant effect (p < 0.05) on phenotypic characteristics, while the sex effect was not significant for some characteristics. In the first phase, the most remarkable discriminating factors were abdominal fat weight, breast muscle weight, chest circumference, shank length, and wingspan. However, in the second phase, notable variations in phenotypic characteristics between village chickens and UCBs were not detected. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed the successful separation of village chickens from high-performance breeds (broiler and colored broiler). Nevertheless, there was overlap among observations for Sasso and village chickens, which approved the possible similarities in their phenotypic characteristics. This study showed clear breed clustering, which leads to the chicken authentication based on their phenotypic characteristics.","Nematbakhsh, Sara; Selamat, Jinap; Idris, Lokman Hakim; Abdull Razis, Ahmad Faizal",Foods,255,20

Spleen samples of all the animals inoculated with parasites had positive polymerase chain reaction tests for Leishmania DNA. Positive spleen cultures for Leishmania were detected earlier (P≤0.018) and were more frequent (five out of the five animals) in intravenously infected animals than in the intradermally infected animals, in presence (two out of the six animals) or absence (three out of the five animals) of salivary gland lysate of L. longipalpis. Significant increase in serum antibodies against Leishmania was observed only in the intravenously infected group (P=0.004). In addition, dogs with infection confirmed by isolation of amastigotes or detection of parasite DNA were, nevertheless, negative for anti-Leishmania antibodies up to 5 months or more after infection. Only animals of the intravenously infected group developed progressive decreases in hematocrit (Pearson r=−0.8076, P=0.0026) and hemoglobin (Pearson r=−0.8403, P=0.0012) during the infection period. No significant difference in the course of infection was observed between groups of intradermally infected animals. The data presented herein confirms that the intradermal inoculation of dogs with Leishmania produces an asymptomatic form of infection. It also fails to show an advantage in using L. longipalpis saliva as an infection-enhancing agent in experimental canine leishmaniasis.","Paranhos-Silva, Moacir; Oliveira, Geraldo G.S.; Reis, Eliana A.; de Menezes, Rejane M.C.; Fernandes, Octávio; Sherlock, Ítalo; Gomes, Regis B.B.; Pontes-de-Carvalho, Lain C.; dos-Santos, Washington L.C.",Vet Parasitol,255,1

The 3C-like protease (3CLpro), the major protease of SARS-CoV-2, is one of the most interesting targets for antiviral drug development because it is highly conserved among SARS-CoVs and plays an important role in viral replication. Herein, we developed high throughput screening for SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitor based on AlphaScreen. We screened 91 natural product compounds and found that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an FDA-approved drug, inhibited 3CLpro activity. The 3CLpro inhibitory effect of ATRA was confirmed in vitro by both immunoblotting and AlphaScreen with a 50% inhibition concentration (IC(50)) of 24.7 ± 1.65 µM. ATRA inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 and Calu-3 cells, with IC(50) = 2.69 ± 0.09 µM in the former and 0.82 ± 0.01 µM in the latter. Further, we showed the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of ATRA on the currently circulating variants of concern (VOC); alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. These results suggest that ATRA may be considered as a potential therapeutic agent against SARS-CoV-2.","Morita, Takeshi; Miyakawa, Kei; Jeremiah, Sundararaj Stanleyraj; Yamaoka, Yutaro; Sada, Mitsuru; Kuniyoshi, Tomoko; Yang, Jinwei; Kimura, Hirokazu; Ryo, Akihide",Viruses,255,24
