12097,In Response,2020-07-16,"In recent years, advances in communications technology and market factors have led to a substantial expansion of telemedicine practice. One potential use of telemedicine is in disaster response, both as a resource for responders as well as a direct link to patients. The advantages of using telehealth to assist in disaster response are accompanied by important questions related to social impact, ethical implications, and regulatory oversight. A narrative review of several of these issues is presented here. The next steps in the development of a robust disaster telemedicine system will include the development of best practices and ethical guidelines agreed upon by all stakeholders, as well as the development of public-private partnerships geared at providing the highest quality disaster telemedicine to the greatest possible number of patients.","Tedeschi, Christopher",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7387787/,631
60701,COVID 19 in neonates.,2020-05-18,"AIM The aim of this study was to analyse postoperative infection in patients undergoing surgery for Crohn's disease (CD) according to the use of preoperative immunosuppressants, including infliximab. METHOD With IRB approval, the records of all patients with CD who underwent abdominal surgery between 2001 and 2008 were reviewed for comorbidity, preoperative medication, type of surgery, stoma construction and postoperative complications. Patients were divided into three categories according to the preoperative medication within 90 days of surgery as follows: infliximab (IFX), other drugs including steroids and/or immunosuppressive agents (OD) and no drugs (ND). RESULTS Two hundred and twenty-five patients were identified. Preoperative comorbidity, surgical indication and type of surgery were not significantly different among the three groups. Ileocolic resection was the most common procedure [50.8%, IFX group; 61.2%, OD group; 41.3%, ND group (P = 0.09)]. Other procedures included total colectomy (16%), protectomy (15%) and others (18%). Laparoscopic surgery was performed in 47.7%, 45.9% and 29.3% of patients in the IFX, OD and ND groups, respectively (P = 0.04). There were no differences in postoperative rates of infection [pneumonia (P = 0.14), wound infection (P = 0.35), abscess (P = 0.34) or anastomotic leakage (P = 0.44)]. Reoperation was needed in 3.0%, 8.2% and 2.6% of patients in the IFX, OD and ND groups, respectively. Multiple logistic regression found no relationship between infliximab use and infection. CONCLUSION There was no difference in the rate of postoperative complications among the groups of patients undergoing surgery for CD pretreated with IFX or other immunosuppressive drugs.","Canedo, J; Lee, S-H; Pinto, R; Murad-Regadas, S; Rosen, L; Wexner, S D",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1318.2010.02469.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20969715/,631

80365,A speculated cause of respiratory inhibition in infants.,2018,"In this paper, we investigate how message construction, style, content, and the textual content of embedded images impacted message retransmission over the course of the first 8 months of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States. We analyzed a census of public communications (n = 372,466) from 704 public health agencies, state and local emergency management agencies, and elected officials posted on Twitter between January 1 and August 31, 2020, measuring message retransmission via the number of retweets (ie, a message passed on by others), an important indicator of engagement and reach. To assess content, we extended a lexicon developed from the early months of the pandemic to identify key concepts within messages, employing it to analyze both the textual content of messages themselves as well as text included within embedded images (n = 233,877), which was extracted via optical character recognition. Finally, we modelled the message retransmission process using a negative binomial regression, which allowed us to quantify the extent to which particular message features amplify or suppress retransmission, net of controls related to timing and properties of the sending account. In addition to identifying other predictors of retransmission, we show that the impact of images is strongly driven by content, with textual information in messages and embedded images operating in similar ways. We offer potential recommendations for crafting and deploying social media messages that can ""cut through the noise"" of an infodemic.","Renshaw, Scott Leo; Mai, Sabrina; Dubois, Elisabeth; Sutton, Jeannette; Butts, Carter T",Health security,https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2020.0200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33606574/,631

Progressive stage. Scalp psoriasis. Nail psoriasis”. This was the first time the patient had experienced psoriasis exacerbation of this severity in his medical history. Presumably, exacerbation of psoriasis was due to the use of hydroxychloroquine. The exacerbation of psoriasis during the pandemic outbreak of Coronavirus disease can be explained by the following reasons: use of hydroxychloroquine, excessive inflammatory response to COVID-19, psychological stress, anxiety, depression, the decline in household income, limited outdoor activities. It is necessary to focus attention of physicians to the fact that patients who have suffered from COVID-19 may develop exacerbation of psoriasis. © 2021 Kazan Medical Journal.

425609,In Response,2020,"Background. Irisin (a glycosylated protein) is cleaved from fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5), which is expressed mainly in animal muscle tissues and has multiple metabolic regulatory activities. However, their roles in controlling myofiber types in skeletal muscle remain unclear. Methodology. Two different commercial hybridized pigs, LJH (a crossed pig containing Chinese native pig genotypes) and DLY (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire) were selected to analyze FNDC5 mRNA expression and the mRNA composition of four adult myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms (IIIaIIxIIb) in the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle. C2C12 myoblasts were cultured to investigate the effects of FNDC5 on the four MyHCs mRNA expressive levels, using small interfering RNA for depletion and a eukaryotic expression vector carrying FNDC5 for overexpression. ZLN005 (a small molecule activator of FNDC5’s upstream control gene PGC1α) or recombinant human irisin protein were also used. Results. In LD muscle, LJH pigs had the higher FNDC5 mRNA level, and MyHC I or IIa proportion than DLY pigs (P &lt; 0.05). For C2C12 cells in vitro, small interfering RNA (si-592) silencing of FNDC5 expression markedly reduced MyHC IIa mRNA levels (P &lt; 0.05), while FNDC5 overexpression significantly increased MyHC IIa mRNA levels (P &lt; 0.05). Exogenous irisin increased the mRNA levels of PGC1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha), FNDC5, MyHCI, MyHCIIa, NRF1 (nuclear respiratory factor 1), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), and TFAM (mitochondrial transcription factor A,) (P &lt; 0.05), and the enzyme activities of SDH (succinate dehydrogenase), CK (creatine kinase), and MDH (malate dehydrogenase) in C2C12 myotubes (P &lt; 0.05). These results showed that FNDC5 mRNA expression had a significant association with the characteristics of myofiber types in porcine muscle, and participated in regulating MyHCs mRNA expression of C2C12 myogenic differentiation cells in vitro. FNDC5 could be an important factor to control muscle fiber types, which provides a new direction to investigate pork quality via muscle fiber characteristics.","Men, X. M.; Xu, Z.

463207,SARS-CoV-2-viruset svekker immunresponsen,2020,"The ongoing COVID-19 corona virus outbreak has caused a global disaster with its deadly spreading. Due to the absence of effective remedial agents and the shortage of immunizations against the virus, population vulnerability increases. In the current situation, as there are no vaccines available; therefore, social distancing is thought to be an adequate precaution (norm) against the spread of the pandemic virus. The risks of virus spread can be minimized by avoiding physical contact among people. The purpose of this work is, therefore, to provide a deep learning platform for social distance tracking using an overhead perspective. The framework uses the YOLOv3 object recognition paradigm to identify humans in video sequences. The transfer learning methodology is also implemented to increase the accuracy of the model. In this way, the detection algorithm uses a pre-trained algorithm that is connected to an extra trained layer using an overhead human data set. The detection model identifies peoples using detected bounding box information. Using the Euclidean distance, the detected bounding box centroid's pairwise distances of people are determined. To estimate social distance violations between people, we used an approximation of physical distance to pixel and set a threshold. A violation threshold is established to evaluate whether or not the distance value breaches the minimum social distance threshold. In addition, a tracking algorithm is used to detect individuals in video sequences such that the person who violates/crosses the social distance threshold is also being tracked. Experiments are carried out on different video sequences to test the efficiency of the model. Findings indicate that the developed framework successfully distinguishes individuals who walk too near and breaches/violates social distances; also, the transfer learning approach boosts the overall efficiency of the model. The accuracy of 92% and 98% achieved by the detection model without and with transfer learning, respectively. The tracking accuracy of the model is 95%.","Ahmed, Imran; Ahmad, Misbah; Rodrigues, Joel J P C; Jeon, Gwanggil; Din, Sadia",Sustain Cities Soc,,631

500205,In Response,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the diagnostic accuracy of CT and initial reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detecting COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We searched three databases, PubMed, EMBASE, and EMCARE, to identify studies reporting diagnostic accuracy of both CT and RT-PCR in detecting COVID-19 infection between December 2019 and May 2020. For accurate comparison, only those studies that had patients undergoing both CT and RT-PCR were included. Pooled diagnostic accuracy of both the tests was calculated by using a bivariate random effects model. RESULTS: Based on inclusion criteria, only 11 studies consisting of 1834 patients were included in the final analysis that reported diagnostic accuracy of both CT and RT-PCR, in the same set of patients. Sensitivity estimates for CT scan ranged from 0.69 to 1.00 and for RT-PCR varied ranging from 0.47 to 1.00. The pooled estimates of sensitivity for CT and RT-PCR were 0.91 [95% CI (0.84-0.97)] and 0.84 [95% CI (0.71-0.94)], respectively. On subgroup analysis, pooled sensitivity of CT and RT-PCR was 0.95 [95% CI (0.88-0.98)] and 0.91 [95% CI (0.80-0.96), p = o.ooo1]. The pooled specificity of CT and RT-PCR was 0.31 [95% CI (0.035-0.84)] and 1.00 [95% CI (0.96-1.00)]. CONCLUSION: CT is more sensitive than RT-PCR in detecting COVID-19 infection, but has a very low specificity. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Since the results of a CT scan are available quickly, it can be used as an adjunctive initial diagnostic test for patients with a history of positive contact or epidemiological history.","Mair, Manish Devendra; Hussain, Mohammed; Siddiqui, Saad; Das, Sudip; Baker, Andrew; Conboy, Peter; Valsamakis, Theodoros; Uddin, Javed; Rea, Peter",Br J Radiol,,631
519183,In Response,2021,"OBJECTIVES: N95 mask is essential for healthcare workers dealing with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, N95 mask causes discomfort breathing with marked reduction in air exchange. This study was designed to investigate whether the use of N95 mask affects rescuer's fatigue and chest compression quality during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). METHODS: After a brief review of CPR, each participant performed a 2-minute continuous chest compression on a manikin wearing N95 (N95 group, n = 40) or surgical mask (SM group, n = 40). Compression rate and depth, the proportions of correct compression rate, depth, complete chest recoil and hand position were documented. Participants' fatigue was assessed using Borg score. RESULTS: Significantly lower mean chest compression rate and depth were both achieved in the N95 group than in the SM group (p < 0.05, respectively). In addition, the proportion of correct compression rate (61 ± 19 vs. 75 ± 195, p = 0.0067), depth (67 ± 16 vs. 90 ± 14, p < 0.0001) and complete recoil (91 ± 16 vs. 98 ± 5%, p = 0.0248) were significantly decreased in the N95 group as compared to the SM group. At the end of compression, the Borg score in the N95 group was significantly higher than that in the SM group (p = 0.027). CONCLUSION: Wearing a N95 mask increases rescuer's fatigue and decreases chest compression quality during CPR. Therefore, the exchange of rescuers during CPR should be more frequent than that recommended in current guidelines when N95 masks are applied.","Tian, Yu; Tu, Xiaopeng; Zhou, Xianlong; Yu, Jiangtao; Luo, Shan; Ma, Liping; Liu, Chang; Zhao, Yan; Jin, Xiaoqing",Am. j. emerg. med,,631

We sought to describe the rapid expansion of the Delta lineage in Ontario, Canada (population 15 million) using mutation profile information and confirmatory whole genome sequencing. Methods: All laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases reported to Public Health Ontario between April 1st and June 12th 2021, with cycle threshold values <=35, were eligible for screening for the N501Y and the E484K mutations. We classified cases via mutation screening as: (1) N501Y-/E484K- (wild-type/Delta), (2) Alpha (N501Y+/E484K-), (3) Beta/Gamma (N501Y+/E484K+), or (4) N501Y-/E484K+ (predominantly B.1.525, and B.1.1.318). Results: The N501Y-/E484K- mutation profile went from having a 29% transmission deficit relative to Alpha (relative Re = 0.71, 95%CI: 0.64, 0.77) on April 1st to having a 50% transmission advantage on June 12th (relative Re = 1.50, 95%CI: 1.31, 1.71). Whole genome sequencing of N501Y-/E484K- cases (N=583) confirmed that the pattern of increasing relative reproduction number coincided with the replacement of wild-type with Delta variant (from 2.2% in early April, to 83% in late May). Discussion: Delta is rapidly overtaking other SARS-CoV-2 variants in Ontario, and has a substantial transmission advantage. An inflection in the proportion of cases missing the N501Y mutation from rapidly decreasing to rapidly increasing, may be an early warning signal for Delta lineage expansion.","Brown, K.

Furthermore, the model incorporates the effect of age-dependent severity of COVID-19 and realistic trajectories of patients through the healthcare system. We assess the impact of the governmental non-pharmacological interventions, such as population-wide social distancing, social distancing within specific subsets of population, reduction of travel between the municipalities, and self-quarantining of the infected individuals. We also evaluate the impact of relaxing of strict restrictions, efficacy of the simple state feedback-based restrictions in controlling the outbreak, and the effect of superspreaders on the disease dynamics. Our simulations show that non-pharmacological interventions reduce the number of infected individuals and the number of fatalities, especially when the social distancing of particularly susceptible subgroups of the population is employed along with case isolation.","Gasparek, M.; Racko, M.; Dubovsky, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.11.20096362v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.20096362,631

679950,The Importance of Resilience and Resolution in the COVID-19 Era. A Surgeon’s View,2020-10-19,"Canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC) is associated with multiple factors. The possible transmission source can be via community-acquired infection (CAI) or hospital-associated infection (HAI), but the variable factors within these two routes are not well described. This study aimed to (i) investigate a cross-sectional incidence of canine respiratory viruses, including influenza (CIV), parainfluenza, distemper (CDV), respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), adenovirus-2, and herpesvirus, in respiratory-diseased dogs, and (ii) analyze the possibly related risk factors. In total 209 dogs with respiratory illness, consisting of 133 CAI and 76 HAI dogs, were studied. Both nasal and oropharyngeal swabs were sampled from each dog and subjected for CIRDC virus detection using multiplex PCRs. Common six viruses associated with CIRDC were detected in both groups with CIV and CRCoV being predominantly found. Only CDV was significantly more prevalent in CAI than HAI dogs. Multiple virus detections were found in 81.2% and 78.9% of CAI and HAI dogs, respectively. Co-detection of CIV and CRCoV was represented the highest proportion and most often found with other CIRD viruses. Moreover, the clinical severity level was notably related to the age of infected dogs, but not to the vaccination status, sex and transmission route. Since healthy or control dogs were not included in this study, the prevalence of the CIRD virus infections could not be assessed.","Piewbang, Chutchai; Rungsipipat, Anudep; Poovorawan, Yong; Techangamsuwan, Somporn",Heliyon,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844019363868; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844019363868; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02726; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31844690/,631
680186,"Dataset on the Fear, Preventive Behaviour and Anxiety Disorder during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan",2020-11-24,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis, which are typically transmitted via respiratory droplets, are leading causes of invasive diseases, including bacteraemic pneumonia and meningitis, and of secondary infections subsequent to post-viral respiratory disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of invasive disease due to these pathogens during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this prospective analysis of surveillance data, laboratories in 26 countries and territories across six continents submitted data on cases of invasive disease due to S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and N meningitidis from Jan 1, 2018, to May, 31, 2020, as part of the Invasive Respiratory Infection Surveillance (IRIS) Initiative. Numbers of weekly cases in 2020 were compared with corresponding data for 2018 and 2019. Data for invasive disease due to Streptococcus agalactiae, a non-respiratory pathogen, were collected from nine laboratories for comparison. The stringency of COVID-19 containment measures was quantified using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Changes in population movements were assessed using Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports. Interrupted time-series modelling quantified changes in the incidence of invasive disease due to S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and N meningitidis in 2020 relative to when containment measures were imposed. FINDINGS: 27 laboratories from 26 countries and territories submitted data to the IRIS Initiative for S pneumoniae (62 837 total cases), 24 laboratories from 24 countries submitted data for H influenzae (7796 total cases), and 21 laboratories from 21 countries submitted data for N meningitidis (5877 total cases). All countries and territories had experienced a significant and sustained reduction in invasive diseases due to S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and N meningitidis in early 2020 (Jan 1 to May 31, 2020), coinciding with the introduction of COVID-19 containment measures in each country. By contrast, no significant changes in the incidence of invasive S agalactiae infections were observed. Similar trends were observed across most countries and territories despite differing stringency in COVID-19 control policies. The incidence of reported S pneumoniae infections decreased by 68% at 4 weeks (incidence rate ratio 0·32 [95% CI 0·27–0·37]) and 82% at 8 weeks (0·18 [0·14–0·23]) following the week in which significant changes in population movements were recorded. INTERPRETATION: The introduction of COVID-19 containment policies and public information campaigns likely reduced transmission of S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and N meningitidis, leading to a significant reduction in life-threatening invasive diseases in many countries worldwide.
