1228,1228,1228,Identification of MicroRNA-Like RNAs in Mycelial and Yeast Phases of the Thermal Dimorphic Fungus Penicillium marneffei,7.688828,8.233467,2013-08-22,"BACKGROUND: Penicillium marneffei is the most important thermal dimorphic fungus causing systemic mycosis in China and Southeast Asia. While miRNAs are increasingly recognized for their roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in animals and plants, miRNAs in fungi were less well studied and their potential roles in fungal dimorphism were largely unknown. Based on P. marneffei genome sequence, we hypothesize that miRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) may be expressed in the dimorphic fungus. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We attempted to identify milRNAs in P. marneffei in both mycelial and yeast phase using high-throughput sequencing technology. Small RNAs were more abundantly expressed in mycelial than yeast phase. Sequence analysis revealed 24 potential milRNA candidates, including 17 candidates in mycelial and seven in yeast phase. Two genes, dcl-1 and dcl-2, encoding putative Dicer-like proteins and the gene, qde-2, encoding Argonaute-like protein, were identified in P. marneffei. Phylogenetic analysis showed that dcl-2 of P. marneffei was more closely related to the homologues in other thermal dimorphic pathogenic fungi than to Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus spp., suggesting the co-evolution of dcl-2 among the thermal dimorphic fungi. Moreover, dcl-2 demonstrated higher mRNA expression levels in mycelial than yeast phase by 7 folds (P<0.001). Northern blot analysis confirmed the expression of two milRNAs, PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2, only in mycelial phase. Using dcl-1(KO), dcl-2(KO), dcl(DKO) and qde-2(KO) deletion mutants, we showed that the biogenesis of both milRNAs were dependent on dcl-2 but not dcl-1 or qde-2. The mRNA expression levels of three predicted targets of PM-milR-M1 were upregulated in knockdown strain PM-milR-M1 (KD), supporting regulatory function of milRNAs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings provided the first evidence for differential expression of milRNAs in different growth phases of thermal dimorphic fungi and shed light on the evolution of fungal proteins involved in milRNA biogenesis and possible role of post-transcriptional control in governing thermal dimorphism.","Lau, Susanna K.

Diagnosis of AA is still challenging and some controversies on its management are still present among different settings and practice patterns worldwide. In July 2015, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) organized in Jerusalem the first consensus conference on the diagnosis and treatment of AA in adult patients with the intention of producing evidence-based guidelines. An updated consensus conference took place in Nijemegen in June 2019 and the guidelines have now been updated in order to provide evidence-based statements and recommendations in keeping with varying clinical practice: use of clinical scores and imaging in diagnosing AA, indications and timing for surgery, use of non-operative management and antibiotics, laparoscopy and surgical techniques, intra-operative scoring, and peri-operative antibiotic therapy. METHODS: This executive manuscript summarizes the WSES guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of AA. Literature search has been updated up to 2019 and statements and recommendations have been developed according to the GRADE methodology. The statements were voted, eventually modified, and finally approved by the participants to the consensus conference and by the board of co-authors, using a Delphi methodology for voting whenever there was controversy on a statement or a recommendation. Several tables highlighting the research topics and questions, search syntaxes, and the statements and the WSES evidence-based recommendations are provided. Finally, two different practical clinical algorithms are provided in the form of a flow chart for both adults and pediatric (< 16 years old) patients. CONCLUSIONS: The 2020 WSES guidelines on AA aim to provide updated evidence-based statements and recommendations on each of the following topics: (1) diagnosis, (2) non-operative management for uncomplicated AA, (3) timing of appendectomy and in-hospital delay, (4) surgical treatment, (5) intra-operative grading of AA, (6) ,management of perforated AA with phlegmon or abscess, and (7) peri-operative antibiotic therapy.","Di Saverio, Salomone; Podda, Mauro; De Simone, Belinda; Ceresoli, Marco; Augustin, Goran; Gori, Alice; Boermeester, Marja; Sartelli, Massimo; Coccolini, Federico; Tarasconi, Antonio; de’ Angelis, Nicola; Weber, Dieter G.; Tolonen, Matti; Birindelli, Arianna; Biffl, Walter; Moore, Ernest E.; Kelly, Michael; Soreide, Kjetil; Kashuk, Jeffry; Ten Broek, Richard; Gomes, Carlos Augusto; Sugrue, Michael; Davies, Richard Justin; Damaskos, Dimitrios; Leppäniemi, Ari; Kirkpatrick, Andrew; Peitzman, Andrew B.; Fraga, Gustavo P.; Maier, Ronald V.; Coimbra, Raul; Chiarugi, Massimo; Sganga, Gabriele; Pisanu, Adolfo; de’ Angelis, Gian Luigi; Tan, Edward; Van Goor, Harry; Pata, Francesco; Di Carlo, Isidoro; Chiara, Osvaldo; Litvin, Andrey; Campanile, Fabio C.; Sakakushev, Boris; Tomadze, Gia; Demetrashvili, Zaza; Latifi, Rifat; Abu-Zidan, Fakri; Romeo, Oreste; Segovia-Lohse, Helmut; Baiocchi, Gianluca; Costa, David; Rizoli, Sandro; Balogh, Zsolt J.; Bendinelli, Cino; Scalea, Thomas; Ivatury, Rao; Velmahos, George; Andersson, Roland; Kluger, Yoram; Ansaloni, Luca; Catena, Fausto",World J Emerg Surg,274,28

Nosocomial infections caused by multidrug resistant microorganisms are a reason for morbidity and mortality worldwide. Plant-based antimicrobial agents are based on synergistic mechanisms which prevent resistance and have been used for centuries against ailments. We suggest the use of cost-effective, eco-friendly Aloe Vera Barbadensis Miller (AV)-iodine biomaterials as a new generation of antimicrobial agents. In a facile, one-pot synthesis, we encapsulated fresh AV gel with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a stabilizing agent and incorporated iodine moieties in the form of iodine (I(2)) and sodium iodide (NaI) into the polymer matrix. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), x-ray diffraction (XRD), microstructural analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) verified the composition of AV-PVP-I(2), AV-PVP-I(2)-NaI. AV, AV-PVP, AV-PVP-I(2), AV-PVP-I(2)-NaI, and AV-PVP-NaI were tested in-vitro by disc diffusion assay and dip-coated on polyglycolic acid (PGA) sutures against ten microbial reference strains. All the tested pathogens were more susceptible towards AV-PVP-I(2) due to the inclusion of “smart” triiodides with halogen bonding in vitro and on dip-coated sutures. The biocomplexes AV-PVP-I(2), AV-PVP-I(2)-NaI showed remarkable antimicrobial properties. “Smart” biohybrids with triiodide inclusions have excellent antifungal and promising antimicrobial activities, with potential use against surgical site infections (SSI) and as disinfecting agents.","Edis, Zehra; Bloukh, Samir Haj",Biomimetics (Basel),274,8

New York City was swiftly declared the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States as case numbers grew exponentially in a matter of days, quickly threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the health care system. This burgeoning crisis led practitioners across specialties to adapt and mobilize rapidly. Plastic surgeons and trainees within the New York University Langone Health system faced uncertainty in terms of future practice, in addition to immediate and long-term effects on undergraduate and graduate medical education. The administration remained vigilant and adaptive, enacting departmental policies prioritizing safety and productivity, with early deployment of faculty for clinical support at the front lines. The authors anticipate that this pandemic will have far-reaching effects on the future of plastic surgery education, trends in the pursuit of elective surgical procedures, and considerable consequences for certain research endeavors. Undoubtedly, there will be substantial impact on the physical and mental well-being of health care practitioners across specialties. Coordinated efforts and clear lines of communication between the Department of Plastic Surgery and its faculty and trainees allowed a concerted effort toward the immediate challenge of tempering the spread of coronavirus disease of 2019 and preserving structure and throughput for education and research. Adaptation and creativity have ultimately allowed for early rebooting of in-person clinical and surgical practice. The authors present their coordinated efforts and lessons gleaned from their experience to inform their community’s preparedness as this formidable challenge evolves.","Berman, Zoe P.; Diep, Gustave K.; Alfonso, Allyson R.; Ramly, Elie P.; Bluebond-Langner, Rachel; Bernstein, G.

Therefore, this study aims to provide more additional evidence for clinical work of talaromycosis. METHODS: To collect clinical information of patients with talaromycosis admitted to hospitals in Zhejiang Province, China from January 1, 2010 to May 31, 2020, retrospectively analyzed clinical characteristics and prognosis, COX multivariate regression analysis was used for survival analysis. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were enrolled, including 76 males, 73 HIV-positive patients, with an average age of 40.1 ± 13.0. Compared to HIV-positive group, the negative group had higher admission age (47.7 ± 14.6 vs 38.1 ± 11.9, p = 0.003) and lower proportion of male (89.0% vs 57.9%, p = 0.004), there was no significant difference in imaging of lungs. There were significantly more HIV-positive patients in those with pleural effusion (100% vs 69.4%, p = 0.001). COX multivariate regression analysis suggested pleural effusion (HR = 3.220; 95% CI 1.117–9.287; p = 0.030) and HIV infection (HR = 0.057; 95% CI 0.009–0.370; p = 0.003) which were independent predictors of prognosis in patients with talaromycosis. CONCLUSIONS: In non-endemic areas, clinical symptoms, signs, and laboratory tests of patients with talaromycosis are similar to those in endemic areas. Patients with pleural effusion have lower survival rate, HIV-infected people are less likely to relapse, and there is no significant correlation between extent of lung involvement and survival of infected patients.

BACKGROUND Patients with CKD exhibit high risks for both thrombotic and bleeding events, thus complicating decision making regarding antiplatelet therapy in the setting of ACS. METHODS The PROMETHEUS study was a multicenter observational study comparing outcomes with prasugrel versus clopidogrel in ACS PCI patients. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 90 days and at 1 year were defined as a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or unplanned revascularization. Clinically significant bleeding was defined as bleeding requiring transfusion or hospitalization. Cox regression multivariable analysis was performed for adjusted associations between CKD status and clinical outcomes. Hazard ratios for prasugrel versus clopidogrel treatment were generated using propensity score stratification. RESULTS The total cohort included 19,832 patients, 28.3% with and 71.7% without CKD. CKD patients were older with greater comorbidities including diabetes and multivessel disease. Prasugrel was less often prescribed to CKD versus non-CKD patients (11.0% vs. 24.0%, respectively; p < 0.001). At 1 year, CKD was associated with higher adjusted risk of MACE (1.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.18 to 1.37) and bleeding (1.46; 95% confidence interval: 1.24 to 1.73). Although unadjusted rates of 1-year MACE were lower with prasugrel versus clopidogrel in both CKD (18.3% vs. 26.5%; p < 0.001) and non-CKD (10.9% vs. 17.9%; p < 0.001) patients, associations were attenuated after propensity stratification. Similarly, unadjusted differences in 1-year bleeding with prasugrel versus clopidogrel (6.0% vs. 7.4%; p = 0.18 in CKD patients; 2.6% vs. 3.5%; p = 0.008 in non-CKD patients) were not significant after propensity score adjustment. CONCLUSIONS Although risks for 1-year MACE were significantly higher in ACS PCI patients with versus without CKD, prasugrel use was 50% lower in patients with renal impairment. Irrespective of CKD status, outcomes associated with prasugrel use were not significant after propensity adjustment. These data highlight the need for randomized studies evaluating the optimal antiplatelet therapy in CKD patients with ACS.","Baber, Usman; Chandrasekhar, Jaya; Sartori, Samantha; Aquino, Melissa; Kini, Annapoorna S; Kapadia, Samir; Weintraub, William; Muhlestein, Joseph B; Vogel, Birgit; Faggioni, Michela; Farhan, Serdar; Weiss, Sandra; Strauss, Craig; Toma, Catalin; DeFranco, Anthony; Baker, Brian A; Keller, Stuart; Effron, Mark B; Henry, Timothy D; Rao, Sunil; Pocock, Stuart; Dangas, George; Mehran, Roxana",JACC.

There are few data about the epidemiology of H1N1 influenza among HCWs. METHODS We conducted a prospective surveillance study for all HCWs at King Abdulaziz Medical City (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) who were confirmed positive for H1N1 influenza by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from June 1 through November 30, 2009. RESULTS During 6 months of surveillance, 526 HCWs were confirmed positive for H1N1 influenza. The distribution of these cases showed 2 clear outbreaks: an initial outbreak (peak at early August) and a shorter second wave (peak at end of October). Among all PCR-confirmed cases, the attack rate was significantly higher in clinical HCWs than in nonclinical HCWs (6.0% vs 4.3%; P < .001) and in HCWs in emergency departments than in HCWs in other hospital locations (17.4% vs 5.0%, P < .001). The percentage of HCWs who received regular influenza vaccination was greater for clinical HCWs than for nonclinical HCWs (46.2% vs 24.6%; P < .001). The majority of HCWs with confirmed H1N1 influenza were young (mean age + or - standard deviation, 34.5 + or - 9.5 years), not Saudi (58.4%), female (55.1%), and nurses (36.1%). Approximately 4% of women who were less than 50 years old were pregnant. Reported exposures included contact with a case (41.0%), contact with a sick household member (23.8%), and recent travel history (13.3%). Respiratory symptoms (98.0%), including cough (90.1%), were the most frequently reported symptoms, followed by muscle aches (66.2%), fever (62.5%), headache (57.9%), diarrhea (16.5%), and vomiting (9.8%). None of these HCWs died, and all recovered fully without hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS The results confirm the vulnerability of HCWs, whether clinical or nonclinical, to emerging H1N1 influenza.","Balkhy, Hanan H; El-Saed, Aiman; Sallah, Mahmoud",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,274,31

PATIENTS AND METHODS In all, 114 consecutive patients (82% male) underwent RARC and urinary diversion between April 2013 and December 2015 [ileal conduit (97 patients) and orthotopic neobladder (17)]. Surgery was performed by two surgeons within a designated regional cancer centre. No exclusion criteria were applied. All patients were managed on the Exeter Enhanced Recovery Pathway (ERP) in a unit where embedded enhanced recovery practice was already established. Data were collected prospectively on the national cystectomy registry - the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) Complex Operations Dataset. RESULTS RARC was technically feasible in all but one case. The mean operating time was 3-5 h with an overall transfusion rate of 8.8%. There were higher-grade complications (Clavien-Dindo grade III-IV) in 18.4% of patients, with a 30-day mortality rate of 0.9%. The median (range) LOS after RARC was 7 (3-68) days, with a re-admission rate of 18.4%. CONCLUSIONS The present series shows that RARC can be safely implemented in a unit experienced in robot-assisted surgery (RAS). Case-selection in this setting is not deemed necessary. There are benefits in terms of lower transfusion rates and reduced LOS. The side-effect profile appears to differ from that of open RC, and despite the fact that complication rate is equivalent; 'technical' complications are over-represented in the RAS group. As such, they should improve with experience, recognition, and modification of surgical technique. ERPs can be safely applied to all patients undergoing RARC to maximise the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.","Miller, Catherine; Campain, Nicholas J; Dbeis, Rachel; Daugherty, Mark; Batchelor, Nicholas; Waine, Elizabeth; McGrath, John S",BJU international,274,1

Objective To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an investigational inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine in China. Interventions In the phase 1 trial, 96 participants were assigned to 1 of the 3 dose groups (2.5, 5, and 10 μg/dose) and an aluminum hydroxide (alum) adjuvant-only group (n = 24 in each group), and received 3 intramuscular injections at days 0, 28, and 56. In the phase 2 trial, 224 adults were randomized to 5 μg/dose in 2 schedule groups (injections on days 0 and 14 [n = 84] vs alum only [n = 28], and days 0 and 21 [n = 84] vs alum only [n = 28]). Design, Setting, and Participants Interim analysis of ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 clinical trials to assess an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. The trials were conducted in Henan Province, China, among 96 (phase 1) and 224 (phase 2) healthy adults aged between 18 and 59 years. Study enrollment began on April 12, 2020. The interim analysis was conducted on June 16, 2020, and updated on July 27, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary safety outcome was the combined adverse reactions 7 days after each injection, and the primary immunogenicity outcome was neutralizing antibody response 14 days after the whole-course vaccination, which was measured by a 50% plaque reduction neutralization test against live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Results Among 320 patients who were randomized (mean age, 42.8 years; 200 women [62.5%]), all completed the trial up to 28 days after the whole-course vaccination. The 7-day adverse reactions occurred in 3 (12.5%), 5 (20.8%), 4 (16.7%), and 6 (25.0%) patients in the alum only, low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively, in the phase 1 trial; and in 5 (6.0%) and 4 (14.3%) patients who received injections on days 0 and 14 for vaccine and alum only, and 16 (19.0%) and 5 (17.9%) patients who received injections on days 0 and 21 for vaccine and alum only, respectively, in the phase 2 trial. The most common adverse reaction was injection site pain, followed by fever, which were mild and self-limiting; no serious adverse reactions were noted. The geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies in the low-, medium-, and high-dose groups at day 14 after 3 injections were 316 (95% CI, 218-457), 206 (95% CI, 123-343), and 297 (95% CI, 208-424), respectively, in the phase 1 trial, and were 121 (95% CI, 95-154) and 247 (95% CI, 176-345) at day 14 after 2 injections in participants receiving vaccine on days 0 and 14 and on days 0 and 21, respectively, in the phase 2 trial. There were no detectable antibody responses in all alum-only groups.

Regarding late toxicities, laryngeal edema grade 3 was noted in 5/57 patients with laryngeal cancer, while severe dysphagia was noted in 4/124 and tracheoesophageal fistula formation in 1/124 patients. The complete response rates obtained were 73%, 84%, and 67% in patients with laryngeal, nasopharyngeal, and other tumors, respectively. The 3-year locoregional progression-free survival was 58%, 73%, and 55%, respectively. CONCLUSION HypoAR chemoradiotherapy is feasible, with acceptable early and late radiotherapy toxicities, response rates and LPFS.","Koukourakis, Ioannis M; Zygogianni, Anna; Kouloulias, Vassilios; Kyrgias, George; Panteliadou, Marianthi; Nanos, Christos; Abatzoglou, Ioannis; Koukourakis, Michael I",Anticancer research,274,1

It has been assumed, but insufficiently examined, that trait changes occur gradually over the years through the accumulation of daily experiences. The current longitudinal measurement burst study examined (a) how changes in average momentary stress reactivity are coupled with changes in trait neuroticism, (b) the extent to which this coupling is specific to stress reactivity and neuroticism, and (c) the extent to which there are age differences in the association between changes in stress reactivity and changes in neuroticism. Participants (N = 581; 50% male) between 14 and 86 years of age completed up to 3 waves (T1-T3) of Big Five trait questionnaires and experience-sampling assessments during 6 years. During each three-week experience-sampling period, participants reported their momentary affect and occurrences of hassles on average 55 times. Latent change models showed that increases over time in affective reactivity to daily hassles were associated with increases in neuroticism. This effect was consistent from T1 to T2 as well as from T2 to T3, and most pronounced in young adulthood. Importantly, the results were specific to associations between stress reactivity and neuroticism because changes in frequency of hassles in daily life did not predict changes in neuroticism, and stress reactivity did not consistently predict changes in the other Big Five traits. The findings help to inform theoretical models that outline how short-term states might contribute to gradual longer-term changes in traits like neuroticism.

Several ongoing studies have reported hydroxychloroquine-induced cardiotoxicity, including development of torsade de pointes (TdP). Meanwhile, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are expected to serve as a tool for assessing drug-induced cardiotoxicity, such as TdP and contraction impairment. However, the cardiotoxicity of COVID-19 treatments has not been fully assessed using hiPSC-CMs. In the present study, we focused on drug repurposing with various modes of actions and examined the TdP risk associated with COVID-19 treatments using field potential using multi-electrode array (MEA) system and motion analysis with hiPSC-CMs. Hydroxychloroquine induced early after depolarization, while remdesivir, favipiravir, camostat and ivermectin had little effect on field potentials. We then analyzed electromechanical window (EMw), which is defined as the difference between field potential and contraction-relaxation durations. Hydroxychloroquine decreased EMw of hiPSC-CMs in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, other drugs have little effect. Our data suggest that hydroxychloroquine has proarrhythmic risk and other drugs have low proarrhythmic risk. Thus, hiPSC-CMs represent a useful tool for assessing the comprehensive cardiotoxicity caused by COVID-19 treatments in non-clinical settings.","Yanagida, Shota; Satsuka, Ayano; Hayashi, Sayo; Ono, Atsushi; Kanda, Yasunari",Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,274,1

The aim of this study was to review the available literature to summarize current data related to the development of hypoparathyroidism after thyroid surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS An analysis of the surgical literature was performed using the search engine EMBASE and PubMed with particular reference to the principal risk factors related to the post-thyroid surgery hypoparathyroidism. Moreover the medical records of 345 patients, who underwent thyroid surgery at the Section of Endocrine Surgery - Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Advanced Technologies ""G. Ingrassia"" University of Catania, Italy, were also examined. RESULTS The definition of hypoparathyroidism varies widely in literature. There is a wide range of reported incidences of transient and permanent postoperative hypoparathyroidism in literature. Extensive surgery, malignant disease and concomitant central and/or lateral neck dissection, autoimmune or Grave's' disease and re-operation represent the most recognized risk factors. A wide consensus exists about transplanting a parathyroid gland when it seems to be nonviable. DISCUSSION Although many improvements have been done in surgical technique, hypoparathyroidism seems to be one of the most common complication after total thyroidectomy. In this study we discuss the diagnosis methods and the importance of its early prediction regardless it is transient or permanent. Recovery time is under discussion: some author consider a gland permanent injury if restoring functionality does not occur within 6 months other 12 months. To assess the parathyroid gland function some authors have been using postoperative PTH level as a useful tool for predicting hypocalcemia. CONCLUSIONS Many efforts are required to address the problem of a consensus on best define these complications. An early low PTH level after total thyroidectomy is associated with a high risk of permanent hypoparathyroidism and normal levels usually exclude long-term parathyroid glands dysfunction. However, the cost of the PTH assay may limit its widespread application. Despite the reassuring presence of new therapeutic strategies, intra-operative preservation of the parathyroid glands is the best prophylaxis to avoid postoperative hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy.

As a result, healthcare workers need to be updated on the best practices for the proper management of the disease. Objective The purpose of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) related to COVID-19 among healthcare personnel. Method This was a cross-sectional study conducted among medical personnel at Dhulikhel Hospital Kathmandu University Hospital using a semi-structured questionnaire on KAP related to COVID-19 from May 8th to June 8th, 2020. We analyzed survey data by using descriptive statistics. Spearman rank correlation, chi-square test and binary logistic analysis were used to examine the association between sociodemographic characteristics with KAP related to COVID-19. Result Among 220 participants, the majority were nurses (60%) followed by doctors (27.7%), paramedics (10%) and technicians (2.3%). The results showed that 68.6% of healthcare personnel had a good knowledge with appropriate practices (98.5%) and negative attitude (59.3%). In the multivariate binary logistic analysis, the healthcare workers with the clinical experience level of one to five years (OR:.42, 95% CI:.19- .96) and more than 5 years (OR: .16, 95% CI: .04-.63) were significantly associated with negative attitude. The confidence score for managing COVID-19 (OR:1.16, 95% CI:1.02-1.34) was significantly associated with an optimistic attitude. Conclusion Healthcare workers are knowledgeable about COVID-19 and proactively practising to minimize the spread of infection but lack optimistic attitudes. Hence, the constantly updated educational programmes related to COVID-19 for targeted groups will contribute to improving healthcare workers' attitude and practices.","Basnet, S; Dahal, S; Tamrakar, D; Shakya, Y R; Jacobson, C; Shrestha, J; Shrestha, S K",Kathmandu University medical journal,274,16

In this context, an early and rapid diagnosis of infected patients that do not require expensive equipment or highly trained personnel is crucial in order to reduce the contagious rate. The aim of this study was to evaluate a chromatographic immunoassay's performance for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-antigen. METHODS: A cross-sectional study included 369 adults from Western México with diagnosis or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two samples were collected; a naso-oropharyngeal was used for a molecular determination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The molecular analysis was carried out using DeCoV19 Kit Triplex (Genes2life S.A.P.I.) based on the CDC diagnostic panel for N1, N2, and N3 regions. The second sample was retrieved from a nasopharyngeal rub and used for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 antigen employing the commercial STANDARD&#8482; Q COVID-19 Ag Test (SD BIOSENSOR). RESULTS: Overall, in 28.2% of the patients was detected the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and 21.4% were positive for antigen detection. The rapid antigen test showed a sensitivity and specificity of 75.9% and 100%, respectively, with a positive predictive and negative values of 100% and 91%. Symptoms as anosmia presented a high OR for the positive diagnosis for both test, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the rapid antigen test of 8.86 (CI = 4.91-16) and 6.09 (CI = 3.42-10.85), respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected a sample of PWE living in the rural communities of the Bolivian Chaco. A standardized questionnaire was developed, consisting of six questions addressing drug availability, drug discontinuation, personnel responsible for drug retrieval during the lockdown, and the presence of seizures in the two months preceding the interview. Questionnaires were administered by community health workers of the rural health centers in September 2020. RESULTS: Seventy PWE (38 men, 54.3%; mean age 26.9â¯±â¯16.7) were interviewed. During the lockdown the large majority of them (nâ¯=â¯51, 73.9%) reported an irregular medication intake mainly due to the lack of antiseizure medications in the local health posts, leading to an increase in seizure frequency. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has unmasked the frailty of the Bolivian health system, especially for the management of chronic diseases such as epilepsy in the rural communities.","Nicoletti, Alessandra; Todaro, Valeria; Cicero, Calogero Edoardo; Giuliano, Loretta; Zappia, Mario; Cosmi, Francesco; Vilte, Estela; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Crespo Gómez, Elizabeth Blanca",Epilepsy Behav,274,1

The disparities of COVID-19 and police brutality have highlighted the pervasiveness of systemic racism in health outcomes. Whether racial bias impacts patient access to advanced HF therapies is unclear. RECENT FINDINGS: As documented in other settings, racial bias appears to operate in HF providers' consideration of patients for advanced therapy. Multiple medical and psychosocial elements of the evaluation process are particularly vulnerable to bias. SUMMARY: Reducing gaps in access to advanced therapies will require commitments at multiple levels to reduce barriers to healthcare access, standardize clinical operations, research the determinants of patient success and increase diversity among providers and researchers.

Intracerebral hemorrhage as a complication of cranioplasty is rare, and it is often fatal. The report describes one case of delayed severe intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage after an uneventful cranioplasty. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 29-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a traumatic left frontotemporoparietal acute subdural hematoma, an emergency decompressive craniectomy with clot removal was performed. Four months after the surgery, cranioplasty was performed with a titanium mesh, the surgery was uneventful. Six hours after the operation, a CT scan demonstrated no bleeding or edema. In the following 2 days after cranioplasty, the patient did not have any neurological deficits, normal blood pressure was recorded every day, no trauma occurred, and routine laboratory test results were within normal limits. However, on the third day after cranioplasty, the patient suffered a sudden severe headache while playing games on his mobile phone, and then rapidly fell into deep coma; both pupils were fixed and dilated at 5 mm with no response to light. An immediate CT scan revealed a massive intracerebral hematoma and intraventricular hematoma on the left side, and the midline shifted to the right side. Therefore, an ipsilateral decompressive craniectomy was performed with evacuation of the hematoma; the obvious bleeding point was not identified, and no obvious vascular abnormalities were found during the operation. A CT scan on day 3 after reoperation revealed successful decompression, and CT angiography showed no vascular abnormalities. Despite all treatment measures, the patient did not regain consciousness, his neurological situation did not improve after the operation, and the patient lived in a vegetative state. CONCLUSION: Although intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage after cranioplasty is extremely rare, it is often fatal. Aside from hyperperfusion and cerebral autoregulation dysfunction, traction injuries to the fragile vessels due to posttraumatic angiogenesis may also be one of the key factors of complications after cranioplasty.","Xiao, Zongyu",Br J Neurosurg,274,29

Additionally, any realistic data-driven model must take into account the large uncertainty in the values reported by official sources, such as the amount of infectious individuals. In this paper we address the above aspects through a hyperbolic compartmental model on networks, in which nodes identify locations of interest, such as cities or regions, and arcs represent the ensemble of main mobility paths. The model describes the spatial movement and interactions of a population partitioned, from an epidemiological point of view, on the basis of an extended compartmental structure and divided into commuters, moving on a suburban scale, and non-commuters, acting on an urban scale. Through a diffusive rescaling, the model allows us to recover classical diffusion equations related to commuting dynamics. The numerical solution of the resulting multiscale hyperbolic system with uncertainty is then tackled using a stochastic collocation approach in combination with a finite-volume IMEX method.

METHODS: Data of 2 source patients and all HCWs with infection risk were obtained in a department in Wuhan from January to February 2020. A questionnaire was designed to evaluate psychological stress of COVID-19 on HCWs. RESULTS: The overall infection rate was 4.8% in HCWs. 10 of 25 HCWs who contacted with 2 source patients were diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19 (8/10) and suspected COVID-19 (2/10). Other 2 HCWs were transmitted by other patients or colleagues. Close care behaviours included physical examination (6/12), life nursing (4/12), ward rounds (4/12), endoscopic examination (2/12). Contacts fluctuated from 1 to 24 times and each contact was short (8.1 min ± 5.6 min). HCWs wore surgical masks (11/12), gloves (7/12), and isolation clothing (3/12) when providing medical care. Most HCWs experienced a mild course with 2 asymptomatic infections, taking 9.8 days and 20.9 days to obtain viral shedding and clinical cure, respectively. Psychological stress included worry (58.3%), anxiety (83.3%), depression (58.3%), and insomnia (58.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Close contact with COVID-19 patients and insufficient protection were key risk factors. Precaution measures and psychological support on COVID-19 is urgently required for HCWs.","Wang, Ge; Guan, Jia-Lun; Zhu, Xiu-Qing; Wang, Mu-Ru; Fang, Dan; Wen, Yue; Xie, Meng; Tian, De-An; Li, Pei-Yuan",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,274,3

Since December 2019, first human cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Wuhan (China) and rapidly has been progressed to a global pandemic declared by the world health organization (WHO) on March 11th 2020. The major complication of COVID-19, is pneumonia, but other presentations like cardiovascular and neurological complications have been reported. Herein, we report a first case of pregnant women presented with bifacial weakness and paraesthesia (BFP) associated to a vestibulocochlear neuritis as post-COVID-19 manifestation. This is a 36-year-old Moroccan female patient with a history of SARS-CoV-2 positive 6 weeks before admission. She presented to the emergency department with rapid bifacial paralysis, bilateral lower extremity paresthesia, vertigo, nausea, vomiting and right auricular pain. An acute stroke was ruled out after neurological examination and brain MRI. Clinical presentation, neurophysiological, audiometry and videonystagmography workup additionally to CSF findings were suggestive of a variant of Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS), which is BFP associated to right vestibulocochlear neuritis. The patient was treated with Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) therapy associated with intravenous steroids. The patient made a complete recovery of the right facial palsy and the sensorineural hearing loss but still have tingling in lower limbs and left facial palsy at 2 weeks´ follow-up. BFP can be induced by COVID-19 as a postinfectious immune-mediated complication. Regarding the pathophysiology of vestibular neuritis, is probably similar to other viral infection causing nerve damage. Clinicians should consider the association of vestibulocochlear neuritis and BFP as a post SARS-CoV-2 manifestation.","Aasfara, Jehanne; Hajjij, Amal; Bensouda, Hatim; Ouhabi, Hamid; Benariba, Fouad",Pan Afr Med J,274,21

This paper compares telehealth responses to (COrona VIrus Disease 2019) COVID-19 across ten countries to identify lessons learned about the complexity of telehealth during critical response such as in response to a global pandemic. Our overall objective is to develop a health systems-based framework for telehealth implementation to support critical response. METHODS: We sought responses from the members of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Telehealth Working Group (WG) on their practices and perception of telehealth practices during the times of COVID-19 pandemic in their respective countries. We then analysed their responses to identify six emerging themes that we mapped to the World Health Organization (WHO) model of health systems. RESULTS: Our analysis identified six emergent themes. (1) Government, legal or regulatory aspects of telehealth; (2) Increase in telehealth capacity and delivery; (3) Regulated and unregulated telehealth; (4) Changes in the uptake and perception of telemedicine; (5) Public engagement in telehealth responses to COVID-19; and (6) Implications for training and education. We discuss these themes and then use them to develop a systems framework for telehealth support in critical response. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has introduced new challenges for telehealth support in times of critical response. Our themes and systems framework extend the WHO systems model and highlight that telemedicine usage in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is complex and multidimensional. Our systems-based framework provides guidance for telehealth implementation as part of health systems response to a global pandemic such as COVID-19.","Basu, Arindam; Kuziemsky, Craig; de Araújo Novaes, Magdala; Kleber, Araujo; Sales, Fernando; Al-Shorbaji, Najeeb; Flórez-Arango, José F; Gogia, Shashi B; Ho, Kendall; Hunter, Inga; Iyengar, Sriram; John, Oommen; John, Sheila; Kulatunga, Gumindu; Rajput, Vije Kumar; Ranatunga, Prasad; Udayasankaran, Jai Ganesh",Yearb. med. inform.

In this work, we develop a tensor method to predict the evolution of epidemic trends for many regions simultaneously. We construct a 3-way spatio-temporal tensor (location, attribute, time) of case counts and propose a nonnegative tensor factorization with latent epidemiological model regularization named STELAR. Unlike standard tensor factorization methods which cannot predict slabs ahead, STELAR enables long-term prediction by incorporating latent temporal regularization through a system of discrete-time difference equations of a widely adopted epidemiological model. We use latent instead of location/attribute-level epidemiological dynamics to capture common epidemic profile sub-types and improve collaborative learning and prediction. We conduct experiments using both county- and state-level COVID-19 data and show that our model can identify interesting latent patterns of the epidemic. Finally, we evaluate the predictive ability of our method and show superior performance compared to the baselines, achieving up to 21% lower root mean square error and 25% lower mean absolute error for county-level prediction.","Kargas, N.; Qian, C.; Sidiropoulos, N.

Of utmost importance across disciplines, translation of empirical evidence to implementation relies upon UV-C measurements frequently confounded by radiometer complexities. To enable rigorous on-respirator measurements, we introduce a photochromic indicator dose quantification technique for: (1) UV-C treatment design and (2) in-process UV-C dose validation. While addressing outstanding indicator limitations of qualitative readout and insufficient dynamic range, our methodology establishes that color-changing dosimetry can achieve the necessary accuracy (>90%), uncertainty (<10%), and UV-C specificity (>95%) required for UV-C dose measurements. In a measurement infeasible with radiometers, we observe a striking ~20× dose variation over N95s within one decontamination system. Furthermore, we adapt consumer electronics for accessible quantitative readout and use optical attenuators to extend indicator dynamic range >10× to quantify doses relevant for N95 decontamination. By transforming photochromic indicators into quantitative dosimeters, we illuminate critical considerations for both photochromic indicators themselves and UV-C decontamination processes.","Su, Alison; Grist, Samantha M; Geldert, Alisha; Gopal, Anjali; Herr, Amy E",PLoS One,274,1

To date, no data have ever been reported to reflect the clinical features of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) among these patients with preexisting ILD. We analyzed the incidence and severity of COVID-19 patients with ILD among 3201 COVID-19 inpatients, and compared two independent cohorts of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing ILD (n = 28) and non-ILD COVID-19 patients (n = 130). Among those 3201 COVID-19 inpatients, 28 of whom were COVID-19 with ILD (0.88%). Fever was the predominant symptom both in COVID-19 with ILD (81.54%) and non-ILD COVID-19 patients (72.22%). However, COVID-19 patients with ILD were more likely to have cough, sputum, fatigue, dyspnea, and diarrhea. A very significantly higher number of neutrophils, monocytes, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10, IL-1ß, and D-Dimer was characterized in COVID-19 with ILD as compared to those of non-ILD COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, logistic regression models showed neutrophils counts, proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL6, IL1ß, IL2R), and coagulation dysfunction biomarkers (D-Dimer, PT, Fbg) were significantly associated with the poor clinical outcomes of COVID-19. ILD patients could be less vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. However, ILD patients tend to severity condition after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. The prognosis of COVID-19 patients with per-existing ILD is significantly worse than that of non-ILD patients. And more, aggravated inflammatory responses and coagulation dysfunction appear to be the critical mechanisms in the COVID-19 patients with ILD.","Huang, Hong; Zhang, Ming; Chen, Can; Zhang, Huilan; Wei, Yanqiu; Tian, Jianbo; Shang, Jin; Deng, Yan; Du, Aihua; Dai, Huaping",J. med. virol,274,4

This study used a methodological research design and was conducted with a development step and an evaluation step. The development step included development of preliminary items, content validity, face validity, and preliminary investigation. The evaluation step included item analysis, construct validity, convergent validity, discriminant validity, criterion validity, factor naming, reliability, and completion of the final instrument. The A-PAS developed in this study consisted of a total of 20 items in five dimensions. The internal consistency of 20 items of the A-PAS, Cronbach's &#945; was 0.92 for 20 items, Cronbach's &#945; for each factor, a subscale of instrument, was 0.61~0.87 and Raykov's p coefficient of each factor, which is a subscale of the tool, was found to be 0.60 to 0.88. Analysis of construct validity showed the results as follows: &#967;2 (p) = 134.05 (p < 0.001), RMSEA = 0.02, RMR = 0.02, GFI = 0.94, CFI = 0.99. The study findings suggest that the developed instrument can be utilized to measure the attitudes of adults toward pandemics, and reflect the reality of the pandemic situation. The outcomes can be used as valuable data for intervention, prevention activities, and policy preparation. The instrument will be applied in the event of a pandemic, such as COVID-19, and will be helpful in promoting the health of the people.","Seong, Mihyeon; Park, Juyoung; Chung, Soojin; Sok, Sohyune",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),274,1

Their mean age was 56.43 years (range 17-83) and gender ratio (male/female) was 43:45. We tested SARS-CoV-2 RNA with commercial kits, investigated the level of serologic IgM and IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using magnetic particle chemiluminescence immunoassays, and compared the results of serologic tests and nucleic acid test (NAT). Among 88 patients, 95.45% were confirmed as positive by the combination of NAT and antibody test, which was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than by single nucleic acid test (73.86%) or serologic test (65.91%). Then the correlation between temporal profile and the level of antibody response was analyzed. It showed that seroconversion started on day 5 after disease onset and IgG level was rose earlier than IgM. Comparison between patients with different disease severity suggested early seroconversion and high antibody titer were linked with less severe clinical symptoms. These results supported the combination of serologic testing and NAT in routine COVID-19 diagnosis and provided evidence on the temporal profile of antibody response in patients with different disease severity.","Kong, Wen-Hua; Zhao, Rong; Zhou, Jun-Bo; Wang, Fang; Kong, De-Guang; Sun, Jian-Bin; Ruan, Qiong-Fang; Liu, Man-Qing",Virol. sin.

Using a combination of machine learning and network science tools, we empirically characterize Twitter conversations about the pandemic in the United States and the Philippines. Our integrated analysis reveals idiosyncratic relationships between bots and hate speech across datasets, highlighting different network dynamics of racially charged toxicity in the US and political conflicts in the Philippines. Most crucially, we discover that bot activity is linked to higher hate in both countries, especially in communities which are denser and more isolated from others.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, myocarditis/pericarditis rates are &#8776;12.6 cases per million doses of second-dose mRNA vaccine among individuals 12 to 39 years of age. In reported cases, patients with myocarditis invariably presented with chest pain, usually 2 to 3 days after a second dose of mRNA vaccination, and had elevated cardiac troponin levels. ECG was abnormal with ST elevations in most, and cardiac MRI was suggestive of myocarditis in all tested patients. There was no evidence of acute COVID-19 or other viral infections. In 1 case, a cardiomyopathy gene panel was negative, but autoantibody levels against certain self-antigens and frequency of natural killer cells were increased. Although the mechanisms for development of myocarditis are not clear, molecular mimicry between the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and self-antigens, trigger of preexisting dysregulated immune pathways in certain individuals, immune response to mRNA, and activation of immunologic pathways, and dysregulated cytokine expression have been proposed. The reasons for male predominance in myocarditis cases are unknown, but possible explanations relate to sex hormone differences in immune response and myocarditis, and also underdiagnosis of cardiac disease in women. Almost all patients had resolution of symptoms and signs and improvement in diagnostic markers and imaging with or without treatment. Despite rare cases of myocarditis, the benefit-risk assessment for COVID-19 vaccination shows a favorable balance for all age and sex groups; therefore, COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone &#8805;12 years of age.","Bozkurt, Biykem; Kamat, Ishan; Hotez, Peter J",Circulation,274,14

Factors involved in establishment and persistence of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms (KPCO) in hospital wastewater plumbing are unclear.Methods: This study was conducted at a hospital with endemic KPCO linked to wastewater reservoirs and robust patient perirectal screening for silent KPCO carriage. Over five months, both rooms occupied and not occupied by KPCO-positive patients were sampled at three wastewater sites within each room (sink drain, sink P-trap, and toilet or hopper). Risk factors for KPCO positivity were assessed using logistic regression. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) identified environmental seeding by KPCO-positive patients.Findings: 219/475(46%) room sampling events were KPCO-positive in at least one wastewater site. KPCO-positive patient exposure was associated with increased risk of environmental positivity for the room and toilet/hopper. Previous positivity and intensive care unit room type were consistently associated with increased risk. Tube feeds were associated with increased risk for the drain, while exposure to patients with Clostridioides difficile was associated with decreased risk. Urinary catheter exposure was associated with increased risk of P-trap positivity. P-trap heaters reduced risk of P-trap and sink drain positivity. WGS identified genomically linked environmental seeding in six of 99 room occupations by 40 KPCO-positive patients.Interpretation: KPCO-positive patients seed the environment in at least 6% of opportunities; once positive for KPCO, wastewater sites are at greater risk of being positive subsequently. Increased nutrient exposure, e.g. due to tube food disposal down sinks, may increase risk; frequent flushing may be protective.IMPORTANCE: Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms (KPCOs) are bacteria that are resistant to most antibiotics and thus are challenging to treat when they cause infections in patients. These organisms can be acquired by patients who are hospitalized for other reasons, complicating their hospital stay and even leading to death. Hospital wastewater sites, such as sink drains and toilets, have played a role in many reported outbreaks over the past decade. The significance of our research is in identifying risk factors for environmental positivity for KPCOs, which will facilitate further work to prevent transmission of these organisms to patients from the hospital environment.","Park, Stacy C; Parikh, Hardik; Vegesana, Kasi; Stoesser, Nicole; Barry, Katie E; Kotay, Shireen M; Dudley, Sarah; Peto, Timothy E A; Crook, Derrick W; Walker, A Sarah; Mathers, Amy J",,274,29

We carried out three discrete analyses using data from a large Israeli HMO to determine whether IgG levels of those fully vaccinated drop over time, the relationship between IgG titer and subsequent PCR-confirmed infection, and compare PCR-confirmed infection rates by period of vaccination. We found that mean IgG antibody levels steadily decreased over the six-month period in the total tested population, and in all age groups. An inverse relationship was found between IgG titer and subsequent CoVid-19 infection (PCR-positive). Those participants vaccinated in the first two months of the campaign were more likely to become infected than those subsequently vaccinated. The 60+ vaccinated had lower initial IgG levels, and were at greater risk of infection. The findings support the decision to add a booster vaccine for those aged 60 and over.

A resulting change in pediatric fracture epidemiology is expected. This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fracture incidence and characteristics. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study comparing acute fractures presenting to a single level I pediatric trauma hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic with fractures during a prepandemic period at the same institution. The ""pandemic"" cohort was gathered from March 15 to April 15, 2020 and compared with a ""prepandemic"" cohort from the same time window in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: In total, 1745 patients presenting with acute fractures were included. There was a significant decrease in the incidence of fractures presenting to our practice during the pandemic (22.5±9.1/d vs. 9.6±5.1/d, P<0.001). The presenting age for all fractures decreased during the pandemic (7.5±4.3 vs. 9.4±4.4 y, P<0.001) because of decreased fracture burden among adolescents. There were also a decrease in the number of fractures requiring surgery (2.2±1.8/d vs. 0.8±0.8/d, P<0.001). During the pandemic, there was an increase in the proportion of injuries occurring at home (57.8% vs. 32.5%, P<0.001) or on bicycles (18.3% vs. 8.2%, P<0.001), but a decrease in those related to sports (7.2% vs. 26.0%, P<0.001) or playgrounds (5.2% vs. 9.0%, P<0.001). There was no increase in time-to-presentation. Patients with distal radius torus fractures were more likely to receive a velcro splint during the pandemic (44.2% vs. 25.9%, P=0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric fracture volume has decreased 2.5-fold during the COVID-19 pandemic, partially because of cessation of organized sports and decreased playground use. In endemic regions, lower trauma volume may allow redeployment of orthopaedic surgeons and staff to other clinical arenas. Given the rising proportion of bicycling injuries, an emphasis on basic safety precautions could improve public health. An observed increase in the prescription of velcro splints for distal radius fractures highlights an opportunity for simplified patient care during the pandemic.

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) complications were considered as cases. Controls were defined as COVID-19 patients without major complications (discharged). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the association between the exposures (periodontitis, demographics and medical conditions) and outcomes (COVID-19 complications). The association was adjusted for possible confounding factors. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were performed to account for stronger risk factors of the determined complications. The results were reported using the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Laboratory data (blood parameters concerning the course of COVID-19) were also compared between the case and control groups.Results The patients were divided into 40 cases and 528 controls. Among the patients with periodontitis, 12.8% (33/258) went through COVID-19 complications, whereas 2.2% (7/310) of those without periodontitis experienced complications. The adjusted OR of patients with periodontitis was 3.67 (95% CI 1.46-9.27) for all COVID-19 complications, 8.81 (95% CI 1.00-77.7) for death, 3.54 (95% CI 1.39-9.05) for intensive care unit admission and 4.57 (95% CI 1.19-17.4) for the need of assisted ventilation. After conducting subgroup analyses for age, diabetes and smoking, periodontitis was still significantly associated with all the outcomes. Laboratory biomarkers (haemoglobin A1c, white blood cells and C-reactive protein) had higher levels in COVID-19 patients with periodontitis than those without periodontal disease.Conclusions This study concluded that periodontitis was significantly associated with higher risks of COVID-19 complications and higher blood marker levels.

Spine trauma is one of the most common types of trauma and will probably be encountered during the fight against COVID-19 and resumption of work and production. Patients with unstable spine fractures or continuous deterioration of neurological function require emergency surgery. The COVID-19 epidemic has brought tremendous challenges to the diagnosis and treatment of such patients. To coordinate the diagnosis and treatment of infectious disease prevention and spine trauma so as to formulate a rigorous diagnosis and treatment plan and to reduce the disability and mortality of the disease, multidisciplinary collaboration is needed. This expert consensus is formulated in order to (1) prevent and control the epidemic, (2) diagnose and treat patients with spine trauma reasonably, and (3) reduce the risk of cross-infection between patients and medical personnel during the treatment.","Wang, Yu-Long; Zhu, Feng-Zhao; Zeng, Lian; Telemacque, Dionne; Saleem Alshorman, Jamal Ahmad; Zhou, Jin-Ge; Xiong, Ze-Kang; Sun, Ting-Fang; Qu, Yan-Zhen; Yao, Sheng; Sun, Tian-Sheng; Feng, Shi-Qing; Guo, Xiao-Dong",Chin J Traumatol,274,16

The involvement in both the central and peripheral nervous systems in COVID-19 patients has been associated with direct invasion of the virus and the induction of cytokine storm. This review discussed the pathways for the virus invasion into the nervous system and characterized the SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine storm. In addition, the mechanisms underlying the immune responses and cytokine storm induction after SARS-CoV-2 infection were also discussed. Although some neurological symptoms are mild and disappear after recovery from infection, some severe neurological complications contribute to the mortality of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the insight into the cause of SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine storm in context with neurological complications will formulate the novel management of the disease and further identify new therapeutic targets for COVID-19.","Chong, Zhao-Zhong; Souayah, Nizar",Curr. med. chem,274,16

Findings showed the immune system in severe Covid-19 patients loses regulatory control of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6 production, called the ""Cytokine storm"" process. This process can cause injury to vital organs, including lungs, kidneys, liver, and ultimately death if not inhibited. While many treatments have been proposed to reduce cytokine storm, but the safety and effectiveness of each of them are still in doubt. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells with self-renewal potential capable of suppressing overactive immune responses and leading to tissue restoration and repair. These immuno-modulatory properties of MSCs and their derivatives (like exosomes) can improve the condition of Covid-19 patients with serious infectious symptoms caused by adaptive immune system dysfunction. Many clinical trials have been conducted in this field using various MSCs around the world. Some of these have been published and summarized in the present article, while many have not yet been completed. Based on these available data, MSCs can reduce inflammatory cytokines, increase oxygen saturation, regenerate lung tissue and improve clinical symptoms in Covid-19 patients. The review article aims to collect available clinical data in more detail and investigate the role of MSCs in reducing cytokine storms as well as improving clinical parameters of Covid-19 patients for use in future clinical studies.","Farkhad, Najmeh Kaffash; Reihani, Hamidreza; Sedaghat, Alireza; Moghadam, Amir Adhami; Moghadam, Ahmad Bagheri; Tavakol-Afshari, Jalil",,274,16

We described how the pandemic affected a tertiary care children hospital with a dedicated COVID-19 regional center. METHODS: We analyzed the characteristics of emergency department (ED) visits, urgent hospitalizations and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-COV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing, and COVID-19 patients across 3 response phases: before the first Italian case, before national lockdown and during lockdown. RESULTS: ED visits decreased from a daily mean of 239.1 before the first COVID-19 Italian case, to 79.6 during lockdown; urgent hospitalizations decreased from 30.6 to 21.2. As of April 20, 2020, 1970 persons were tested for SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and 2.6% were positive. Positive rates were 1.2% in the ED, 21.1% in the COVID center and 0.5% in other wards. The median age of COVID-19 patients (N = 33) was 6.7 years, 27% had coexisting conditions and 79% were related to family clusters. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic strongly impacted on the use of hospital services, with a 67% reduction in ED visits and a 31% reduction in urgent hospitalizations. Separating the flows of suspected patients from all other patients, and centralization of suspected and confirmed cases in the COVID center enabled to control the risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Delay in hospital use for urgent care must be avoided, and clear communication on infection prevention and control must be provided to families. Further studies are needed to assess how the reduction in hospital use affected children healthcare needs during the pandemic.","Ciofi Degli Atti, Marta Luisa; Campana, Andrea; Muda, Andrea Onetti; Concato, Carlo; Ravà, Lucilla; Ricotta, Lara; Reale, Antonino; Barbieri, Maria; D039,; Argenio, Patrizia; Lancella, Laura; Villani, Alberto; Raponi, Massimiliano",Pediatr Infect Dis J,274,1

PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched. The pooled diagnostic value (95% confidence interval [CI]) of D-dimer was evaluated with a bivariate mixed-effects binary regression modeling framework. Sensitivity analysis and meta regression were used to determine heterogeneity and test robustness. A Spearman rank correlation tested threshold effect caused by different cut offs and units in D-dimer reports. The pooled sensitivity of the prognostic performance of D-dimer for the severity, mortality and VTE in COVID-19 were 77% (95% CI: 73%-80%), 75% (95% CI: 65%-82%) and 90% (95% CI: 90%-90%) respectively, and the specificity were 71% (95% CI: 64%-77%), 83% (95% CI: 77%-87%) and 60% (95% CI: 60%-60%).

The NO-donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) had a dose dependent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication, while the non S-nitrosated NAP was not active, as expected. Although the viral replication was not completely abolished (at 200 µM and 400 µM), SNAP delayed or completely prevented the development of viral cytopathic effect in treated cells, and the observed protective effect correlated with the level of inhibition of the viral replication. The capacity of the NO released from SNAP to covalently bind and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL recombinant protease in vitro was also tested. The observed reduction in SARS-CoV-2 protease activity was consistent with S-nitrosation of the enzyme active site cysteine.","Akaberi, Dario; Krambrich, Janina; Ling, Jiaxin; Luni, Chen; Hedenstierna, Göran; Järhult, Josef D; Lennerstrand, Johan; Lundkvist, Åke",Redox Biol,274,16

This research aimed to explore the effect of adverse childhood experience (ACE) on suicide ideation in young cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Selfreported questionnaires analyzed the mediating effects of sleep quality, anxiety symptoms, and inflammatory conditions between ACE and suicide ideation. Materials and Methods: A total of 197 young cancer patients (age 18–40) completed questionnaires and a blood test. Correlation analysis and structural equation model were used to explore the relationships between ACE, sleep quality, anxiety symptom, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and suicide ideation. The mediating roles of sleep quality, anxiety symptoms, and CRP levels on the influence of ACE on suicide ideation were explored. Results: ACE was positively related to anxiety symptoms, CRP levels, and suicide ideation, and negatively related to sleep quality. Anxiety symptoms and CRP levels were positively related to suicide ideation, while sleep quality was negatively related to suicide ideation. Anxiety symptoms were positively related to CRP levels but negatively related to sleep quality. From these results, we found ACE affected suicide ideation directly and was mediated by roles sleep quality, anxiety symptom and CRP. Conclusion: ACE not only directly affected suicide ideation but also affected suicide ideation through sleep quality, anxiety symptoms, and inflammatory conditions in young cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

From a total of 1200 hospitalised patients with COVID-19, 369 with and 369 without myalgia at hospital admission were assessed 7.2 months (SD 0.6) after hospital discharge. A greater proportion (P = 0.03) of patients with myalgia at hospital admission (20%) showed &#8805;3 post-COVID symptoms when compared with individuals without myalgia (13%). A higher proportion of patients presenting myalgia (odds Rratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.90) exhibited musculoskeletal post-COVID pain when compared to those without myalgia. The prevalence of musculoskeletal post-COVID pain in the total sample was 38%. Fifty percent of individuals with preexisting musculoskeletal pain experienced a worsening of their symptoms after COVID-19. No differences in fatigue, dyspnoea, anxiety/depressive levels, or sleep quality were observed between myalgia and nonmyalgia groups. The presence of myalgia at hospital admission was associated with preexisting history of musculoskeletal pain (OR 1.62, 95% confidence interval 1.10-2.40). In conclusion, myalgia at the acute phase was associated with musculoskeletal pain as long-term post-COVID sequelae. In addition, half of the patients with preexisting pain conditions experienced a persistent exacerbation of their previous syndromes.","Fernández-de-Las-Peñas, César; Rodríguez-Jiménez, Jorge; Fuensalida-Novo, Stella; Palacios-Ceña, María; Gómez-Mayordomo, Víctor; Florencio, Lidiane L; Hernández-Barrera, Valentín; Arendt-Nielsen, Lars",Pain,274,30

In the recent time, COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic disrupted normal human lives, and motivated by the urgent need of combating COVID-19, researchers have put significant efforts in modelling and analysing the disease spread patterns for effective preventive measures (in addition to developing pharmaceutical solutions, like vaccine). In this regards, it is absolutely necessary to develop an analytics framework by extracting and incorporating the knowledge of heterogeneous datasources to deliver insights in improving administrative policy and enhance the preparedness to combat the pandemic. Specifically, human mobility, travel history and other transport statistics have significant impacts on the spread of any infectious disease. In this direction, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal knowledge mining framework, named STOPPAGE to model the impact of human mobility and other contextual information over large geographic area in different temporal scales. The framework has two major modules: (i) Spatio-temporal data and computing infrastructure using fog/edge based architecture; and (ii) Spatio-temporal data analytics module to efficiently extract knowledge from heterogeneous data sources. Typically, we develop a Pandemic-knowledge graph to discover correlations among mobility information and disease spread, a deep learning architecture to predict the next hot-spot zones; and provide necessary support in home-health monitoring utilizing Femtolet and fog/edge based solutions. The experimental evaluations on real-life datasets related to COVID-19 in India illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.","Ghosh, Shreya; Mukherjee, Anwesha; Ghosh, Soumya K; Buyya, Rajkumar",,274,1

Different patterns of disease progression infer a diverse host immune response, with interferon (IFN) being pivotal. IFN-I and III are produced and released by virus-infected cells during the interplay with SARS-CoV-2, thus establishing an antiviral state in target cells. However, the efficacy of IFN and its role in the possible outcomes of the disease are not yet defined, as it is influenced both by factors inherent to the virus and to the host. The virus exhibits multiple strategies to counteract the innate immune response, including those shared by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other novel ones. Inborn errors in the host may affect IFN-related effector proteins or decrease its levels in plasma upon neutralization by preexistent autoantibodies. This battle between the IFN response triggered upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, its magnitude and timing, and the efficacy of its antiviral tools in dispute against the viral evasion strategies together with the genetic factors of the host, generate a scenario whose fate contributes to defining the severity of COVID-19.","Quarleri, Jorge; Delpino, M Victoria",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,274,16

Clinical data from 38 COVID-19 patients who were diagnosed, treated and discharged from the Qishan Hospital in Yantai over the period from January to February 2020 were analysed. NLR and procalcitonin (PCT) were determined in the first and fourth weeks after their admission, along with the clinical characteristics and laboratory test results of these patients. Based on results as obtained on the first and fourth weeks after admission, five indices consisting of NLR, white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes (LY) and monocytes (MON) were selected to generate receiver operating characteristic curves, while optimal cutoff values, sensitivities and specificities were obtained according to the Yuden index. Statistically significant differences in neutrophils, LY and the NLR were present in the severe vs. moderate COVID-19 group from the first to the fourth week of their hospitalisation. The cut-off value of NLR for predicting the severity of COVID-19 was 4.425, with a sensitivity of 0.855 and a specificity of 0.979. A statistically significant positive correlation was present between PCT and NLR in the severe group as determined within the first week of admission. NLR can serve as a predictor of COVID-19 disease severity as patients' progress from the first to the fourth week of their hospitalisation. The statistically significant positive correlation between levels of NLR and PCT in severe patients indicated that increases in NLR were accompanied with gradual increases in PCT.","Wang, Kun; Wang, Xin; Du, Jiangdong; Liu, Chunling; Jiang, Yanan; Zhang, Heqiu; Jiang, Haiming; Fu, Qiang",Epidemiol Infect,274,20

Using mixed methods, we examine funeral planning as end-of-life relational spending. We identify how relational motives drive and manifest in funeral planning, even when the primary recipient of goods and services is dead. Qualitative interviews with consumers who had planned pre-COVID funerals (N = 15) reveal a caring orientation drives funeral decision-making for loved ones and for self-planned funerals. Caring practices manifest in three forms: (a) balancing preferences between the planner, deceased, and surviving family;(b) making personal sacrifices;and (c) spending amount (Study 1). Archival funeral contract data (N = 385) reveal supporting quantitative evidence of caring-driven funeral spending. Planners spend more on funerals for others and underspend on their own funerals (Study 2). Preregistered experiments (N = 1,906) addressing selection bias replicate these results and find generalization across different funding sources (planner-funded, other-funded, and insurance;Studies 3A–3C).

This condition has resulted in a change in how learning and assessment of psychiatric and interprofessional practice occur. The pandemic has also increased clinical mentors' need to follow their mentees' educational progress via virtual technology, including smartphone-based educational apps. The aim of the study is to propose a model in psychiatric and medical interprofessional practice e-assessment. METHODS: In this study, 228 undergraduate healthcare students underwent a training period in interprofessional practice across specialties being assessed by Ecological Momentary e-Assessment (EMeA), and consisting of ongoing or before/after Interprofessional Education (IPE) learning evaluations with the assistance of an IPE-app linked to online surveys. The Goodness of Fit Test Chi-square and t-test statistics analyzed the data. RESULTS: Surveys during, at entry and exit points in IPE captured increased percentages of learners, specifically, reporting high patient satisfaction with interprofessional teams (c2=22.54; p<.01), learners experiencing very good quality of care when delivered by interprofessional teams (c2=30.02; p<.01) assessed by distance technology, and learners selecting less frequently peers from the same clinical background when support was needed in patient care (c2=19.84; p<.01). CONCLUSIONS: Contextual assessment (in the real-time and real-world scenario) of IPE learning moments via EMeA shows its value and applicability during the current covid-19 pandemic when the assessment of learning cannot occur face-to-face between learners and teachers. All healthcare students, including those on psychiatric rotations, could log in their progress, self-reflective assessments, and responses to coordinated care in interprofessional teams, without needing direct contact with their clinical tutors, and while treating patients with mental and physical illnesses, also including covid-19 positive patients.","Lazzari, Carlo; McAleer, Sean; Nusair, Abdul; Rabottini, Marco",Riv Psichiatr,274,33

Part of the patients (21.57%) reported their disease conditions worsening. The reduction in physical exercise was a risk factor for worsening conditions (OR=17.593, p=0.009). Some patients reported an alteration of medication regimens during the epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemic of COVID-19 might have a certain impact on many aspects of Hubei IBD patients within four weeks after the traffic control. Doctors could utilize the results from our questionnaire to guide IBD patients' self-management. METHODS: A questionnaire was designed containing the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI), the 6-point Mayo Score, the short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ) and distributed to Hubei IBD patients online within four weeks of traffic control after the outbreak, it also included questions about patients' self-reported disease conditions and their epidemiological features of COVID-19.","Yu, Meiping; Ye, Zhenghao; Chen, Yu; Qin, Tingting; Kou, Jiguang; Tian, De039; an,; Xiao, Fang",Aging (Albany NY),274,21

Probiotics main mechanisms of action include enhanced mucosal barrier function, direct antagonism with pathogens, inhibition of bacterial adherence and invasion capacity in the intestinal epithelium, boosting of the immune system and regulation of the central nervous system. It is accepted that there is a mutual communication between the gut microbiota and the liver, the so-called ""microbiota-gut-liver axis"" as well as a reciprocal communication between the intestinal microbiota and the central nervous system through the ""microbiota-gut-brain axis."" Moreover, recently the ""gut-lung axis"" in bacterial and viral infections is considerably discussed for bacterial and viral infections, as the intestinal microbiota amplifies the alveolar macrophage activity having a protective role in the host defense against pneumonia. The importance of the normal human intestinal microbiota is recognized in the preservation of health. Disease states such as, infections, autoimmune conditions, allergy and other may occur when the intestinal balance is disturbed. Probiotics seem to be a promising approach to prevent and even reduce the symptoms of such clinical states as an adjuvant therapy by preserving the balance of the normal intestinal microbiota and improving the immune system. The present review states globally all different disorders in which probiotics can be given. To date, Stronger data in favor of their clinical use are provided in the prevention of gastrointestinal disorders, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, allergy and respiratory infections. We hereby discuss the role of probiotics in the reduction of the respiratory infection symptoms and we focus on the possibility to use them as an adjuvant to the therapeutic approach of the pandemic COVID-19. Nevertheless, it is accepted by the scientific community that more clinical studies should be undertaken in large samples of diseased populations so that the assessment of their therapeutic potential provide us with strong evidence for their efficacy and safety in clinical use.","Stavropoulou, Elisavet; Bezirtzoglou, Eugenia",Front Immunol,274,24

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Beck anxiety inventory and a clinical activities scale were utilized as data collection tools and distributed to neurosurgeons in Turkey as an online survey. Descriptive statistical methods, significance tests and correlation and regression analyses were employed to analyze the data. The data analysis was carried out in a 95% confidence interval Results: Of the 240 neurosurgeons who participated in the study, 63.8% had encountered cases of COVID-19 and 53.8% had handled patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The study results showed that the pandemic did not cause anxiety in 62.9% of the respondents, but it caused mild anxiety in 13.8% and moderate anxiety in 12.12%. The findings also revealed a low linear correlation between the anxiety values and occupational anxiety of the neurosurgeons and low inverse correlation between anxiety values and the protection factor in the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused serious disruptions in the routine functioning of neurosurgery clinics and changes in the attitudes of neurosurgeons. Healthcare organizations should take the necessary precautions and measures to resolve the anxiety problems of healthcare professionals, such as providing professional support, and ensure that they can work in a safer environment.","Yilmaz, Ali; Karakoyun, Durmus Oguz; ISik, Hasan Serdar; Bostan, Sedat",Turkish neurosurgery,274,1

Stunting incident was often found in low income families who were unable to afford nutritious food. During COVID-19 pandemic, certain types of food might not be available and affordable for some families. The stunting incident could be increased due to decline in family income, change in food availability and disruption to health and social services. Objective: To determine the effect of family income during COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of stunting in preschool children at PuspaBangsa Kindergarten, Bogor City. Method: This type of research was analytical survey with cross sectional approach. The total sample was 35 families who had their children studied at PuspaBangsa Kindergarten. The instrument in this study was filling out a questionnaire using Google Form on family income and weight of preschool children to determine the incidence of stunting in preschool children. Conclusion: 7 participants (20%) were found with family income less than the Regional Minimum Wage. The results of univariate analysis for stunting incident variables were as followed: normal height category 23 (65.7%) and very short height category 4 (11.4%). The statistical analysis obtained p-value = 0.02, which means there was significant relationship between family income and the incidence of stunting at Puspa Bangsa Kindergarten, Bogor City.","Yanti, T.; Fauziah, D.",Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development,274,1

Results: RRT activations for respiratory distress rose substantially during the rapid COVID-19 surge and plateau (2.38 (95% CI 1.39-3.36) activations per 1000 floor patient-days v. 1.27 (0.82-1.71) during the pre-COVID-19 era; p = 0.02); all-cause RRT rates were not significantly different (5.40 (95% CI 3.94-6.85) v. 4.83 (3.86-5.80) activations per 1000 floor patient-days, respectively; p = 0.52). Throughout the COVID-19 era, respiratory distress accounted for a higher percentage of RRT activations in COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 patients (57% vs. 28%, respectively; p = 0.001). During the surge, we adapted RRT guidelines to reduce in-room personnel and standardize personal protective equipment based on COVID-19 status and risk to providers, created decision-support pathways for respiratory emergencies that accounted for COVID-19 status uncertainty, and expanded critical care consultative support to floor teams. Conclusion: Increased frequency and complexity of RRT activations for respiratory distress during the COVID-19 surge prompted the creation of clinical tools and strategies that could be applied to other hospitals.","Mitchell, Oscar J L; Neefe, Stacie; Ginestra, Jennifer C; Baston, Cameron M; Frazer, Michael J; Gudowski, Steven; Min, Jeff; Ahmed, Nahreen H; Pascual, Jose L; Schweickert, William D; Anderson, Brian J; Anesi, George L; Falk, Scott A; Shashaty, Michael G S",Resusc Plus,274,1

The present study is to examine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression of HCW in China during the COVID-19 epidemic, and to determine the risk factors predicting psychological morbidities that can be used as psychological intervention targets. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the psychological levels of HCW in multiple centers in China. The prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression were determined by using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) and Hospital Anxiety / Depression scale (HAD). Psychology related factors were evaluated and correlation between job title and contact history was analyzed. RESULTS: We received 958 of effective responses, 73.6% of which were from Wuhan and 67.2% were female participants. 55.1% of respondents had psychological stress that is higher than that of HCW during SARS. 54.2% and 58% of participants had symptoms of anxiety and depression. Stress levels of HCW were different in job titles and years of work experience. Anxiety and depression levels were different between different gender, job titles, degrees of protective measures and levels of contact history. Gender, intermediate title, protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for anxiety. Protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for depression. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 epidemic has induced stress levels for HCW, and high percentages of HCW have anxiety and depression.

However, due to the low detection capacity of SARS-CoV-2 and the high false negative rate at the beginning of the epidemic, and the medical staff did not know much about the condition and treatment of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, our hospital paid more attention to the results of other laboratory indicators in the early stage of the epidemic of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to explore clinical characteristics and laboratory results of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China and provide evidence for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Retrospective study of 562 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Wuhan Red Cross Hospital from January 28 to March 12, 2020 was performed. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the severity of illness: Mild group (n = 436) and Severe group (n = 126). The general clinical characteristics of the patients were collected, including age, gender, past medical history, clinical symptoms, etc. All patients underwent blood routine test, biochemical indicators, blood gas analysis and other related laboratory examinations. The clinical data and laboratory results of the two groups were compared. Compared with the patients in the Mild group, the patients in Severe group were older and the proportion of patients suffering from underlying disease (61.11%) was higher (p &lt; 0.05). In Severe group, WBC, NEUT, NLR, PCT, CRP, IL-6, ESR, CK, CK-MB, Mb, cTnI, D-D, Fib, and PaCO2 of patients had higher values, while the levels of LYMPH, HBG, PLT, PO2, and SaO2 were significantly reduced, and the differences were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). Between Severe group and Mild group, there was no significant difference in other indexes such as ALT, Urea, and Cr (p &gt; 0.05) or in the positive rate of influenza A, B virus, or other respiratory pathogens by pairwise comparison (p &gt; 0.05). Viral infection and inflammation were more serious in elderly patients or patients with underlying diseases. They were more likely to progress to severely ill patients. Clinical manifestations and laboratory examinations were important basis for clinical classification and treatment. Therefore, Timely and accurate attention to these indicators is beneficial to prevent the deterioration of the disease.

Previous outbreaks of coronaviruses and other viruses have suggested the importance of diagnostic technologies in fighting viral outbreaks. Nucleic acid detection techniques are the gold standard for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Viral antigen tests and serological tests that detect host antibodies have also been developed for studying the epidemiology of COVID-19 and estimating the population that may have immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, the availability, cost, and performance of existing viral diagnostic technologies limit their practicality, and novel approaches are required for improving our readiness for global pandemics. Here, we review the principles and limitations of major viral diagnostic technologies and highlight recent advances of molecular assays for COVID-19. In addition, we discuss emerging technologies, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) systems, high-throughput sequencing, and single-cell and single-molecule analysis, for improving our ability to understand, trace, and contain viral outbreaks. The prospects of viral diagnostic technologies for combating future pandemic threats are presented.","Zhu, Ninghao; Wong, Pak Kin",SLAS Technol,274,8

The aim was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). METHODS: Data on the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of 95 RRMS patients were collected. We used a self-designed questionnaire, the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 Instrument (MSQOL-54), Hamilton scales for the assessment of anxiety (HAM-A), and depression (HAM-D). Patients who were tested one year ago were reassessed using the same questionnaires during the COVID-19 outbreak. Group of 99 healthy individuals (HC) were tested, using the same questionnaires. RESULTS: The main concerns in RRMS patients were that someone that they know could be infected with COVID-19 (78.5%), or could die due to the infection (33.8%), and the lack of specific treatment options (25.8%). The main concerns about the RRMS status were that their disease would be worse if they get infected with COVID-19 (36.4%), that they would experience some difficulties in drug availability (43.6%), that they could not go to the hospital as usual (72.4%). Results on all questionnaires were worse in RRMS patients than in HC (p<0.01). We noticed a statistically significant difference between the results obtained a year ago and the results from April 2020 in HAM-A (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There is an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of RRMS patients. Healthcare organizations need to provide professional therapeutic advice and psychosocial support for this population of patients during the pandemic.","Stojanov, Aleksandar; Malobabic, Marina; Milosevic, Vuk; Stojanov, Jelena; Vojinovic, Slobodan; Stanojevic, Goran; Stevic, Milos",Mult Scler Relat Disord,274,1

DESIGN: A population-based cohort study. METHOD: Two waves of panel data in 2014 and 2016 from the China Family Panel Study were used. A total of 8025 urban adults were identified. The Hausman-Taylor model was used to analyse the theoretical relationship between smoking and income. RESULTS: The percentage of current smokers decreased from 27.39% (2014) to 26.24% (2016), while the percentage of former smokers rose from 9.78% to 11.78%. The results from the Hausman-Taylor model showed that current smokers and former smokers are associated with statistically significant decrease in the income of urban residents of 37.70% and 44.00%, respectively, compared with that of non-smokers. After eliminating the impact of smoking on income, the poverty rate among urban residents decreased from 15.33% to 13.63%. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking can significantly reduce the income of Chinese urban residents, resulting in immense negative impacts on Chinese society. Therefore, the government should raise the tax rate on tobacco, include smoking cessation treatment in medical insurance coverage, promote publicity campaigns on the awareness of tobacco hazards and encourage smokers to quit smoking early.","Wei, Han; Zhong, Zhigang; Yang, Lian; Yao, Tingting; Huang, Shiyao; Mao, Zhengzhong",BMJ Open,274,1

The translation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome for most open reading frames (ORFs) occurs via RNA intermediates termed “sub-genomic RNAs”. sgRNAs are produced through discontinuous transcription which relies on homology between transcription regulatory sequences (TRS-B) upstream of the ORF start codons and that of the TRS-L which is located in the 5’ UTR. TRS-L is immediately preceded by a leader sequence. This leader sequence is therefore found at the 5’ end of all sgRNA. We applied periscope to 1,155 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Sheffield, UK and validated our findings using orthogonal datasets and in vitro cell systems. Using a simple local alignment to detect reads which contain the leader sequence we were able to identify and quantify reads arising from canonical and non-canonical sgRNA. We were able to detect all canonical sgRNAs at expected abundances, with the exception of ORF10. A number of recurrent non-canonical sgRNAs are detected. We show that the results are reproducible using technical replicates and determine the optimum number of reads for sgRNA analysis. In VeroE6 ACE2+/− cell lines, periscope can detect the changes in the kinetics of sgRNA in orthogonal sequencing datasets. Finally, variants found in genomic RNA are transmitted to sgRNAs with high fidelity in most cases. This tool can be applied to all sequenced COVID-19 samples worldwide to provide comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA.","Parker, Matthew D; Lindsey, Benjamin B; Leary, Shay; Gaudieri, Silvana; Chopra, Abha; Wyles, Matthew; Angyal, Adrienn; Green, Luke R; Parsons, Paul; Tucker, Rachel M; Brown, Rebecca; Groves, Danielle; Johnson, Katie; Carrilero, Laura; Heffer, Joe; Partridge, David G; Evans, Cariad; Raza, Mohammad; Keeley, Alexander J; Smith, Nikki; Filipe, Ana Da Silva; Shepherd, James G; Davis, Chris; Bennett, Sahan; Kohl, Alain; Aranday-Cortes, Elihu; Tong, Lily; Nichols, Jenna; Thomson, Emma C; Wang, Dennis; Mallal, Simon; de Silva, Thushan I",bioRxiv,274,20

Regulatory effects of LRP2 on the JNK pathway and cell viability in metformin-treated TPC-1 cells were assessed. RESULTS: Viability in TPC-1 cells gradually decreased with the treatment of increased doses of metformin either for 24 h or 48 h. The apoptotic rate was concentration-dependently elevated by metformin treatment. Relative levels of LRP2 and p-JNK1 were concentration-dependently downregulated by metformin treatment. In addition, overexpression of LRP2 partially abolished the inhibitory effect of metformin on the viability of TPC-1 cells. CONCLUSION: Metformin treatment suppresses the proliferative ability and induces apoptosis of TPC-1 cells by downregulating LRP2 to block the JNK pathway.","He, Yang; Cao, Lingling; Wang, Li; Liu, Lingping; Huang, Ying; Gong, Xuan",Onco Targets Ther,274,8

BACKGROUND: From the current experience of working during the novel Coronavirus outbreak, it is statistically significant to identify the challenges that nurses in Saudi Arabia face in their clinical practice and determine how these challenges affected their practice. DESIGNS: A qualitative descriptive study. METHODS: An in‐depth interview with eight Registered Nurses in Saudi Arabia who worked in areas where the novel Coronavirus patients are treated were conducted between 10 and 23 April. RESULTS: The following eight major themes were identified from this study: physical exhaustion, fear of infection, providing care with uncertainty, uncomfortable use of personal protective equipment, missed nursing care, prolonged procedures, lack of guidance during the outbreak and lack of managerial support. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that nurses’ leaders should take active roles in empowering nursing staff.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted of 300 doctors working in public primary care clinics. In addition, a qualitative study was conducted in two selected general outpatient clinics (GOPCs) with 10 doctors between September and December 2009. RESULTS: We found that there was an increase in clinical service demand for public primary care doctors and that there was lower compliance with hand washing as compared to the wearing of masks among GOPC doctors during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Since hand hygiene and influenza vaccination are effective methods to prevent the spread of influenza infection, future studies should explore the reasons for non-compliance with these preventive behaviors among doctors. More education and training in dealing with influenza A H1N1 infection may be needed.","Wong, Samuel Y.S.; Kung, Kenny; Wong, Martin C.S.; Wong, Carmen; Tsui, Wendy; Chan, King; Liang, Jun; Lee, Nelson L.S.; Cheung, Annie W.L.; Wong, Eliza L.Y.",Int J Infect Dis,274,24

Sixteen MAbs which reacted with all of the 11 strains of feline coronaviruses, also reacted with canine coronavirus (CCV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). In many of them, the polypeptide specifity was the recognition of transmembrane (E1) protein of the virus. We succeeded in obtaining MAbs which did not react with eight strains FIPV Type I viruses (showing cell-associated growth) but reacted with FIPV Type II (79-1146, KU-1) and/or FECV Type II (79-1683) viruses (showing non-cell associated growth). These MAbs also reacted with CCV or TGEV. These MAbs recognized peplomer (E2) glycoprotein, and many antigenic differences were found in this E2 protein. These results suggest that FIPV Type II and FECV Type II viruses are antigenically closer to TGEV or CCV than to FIPV Type I viruses. Furthermore, the MAb prepared in this study has enabled discrimination between FIPV strain 79-1146 and FECV strain 79-1683, which was thought to be impossible by the previous serological method.","Hohdatsu, T.; Sasamoto, T.; Okada, S.; Koyama, H.",Veterinary Microbiology,274,8

Initially intended to improve health care for patients in remote settings, telemedicine now has a broad clinical scope with the general purpose of providing convenient, safe, and time- and cost-efficient care. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has created marked nationwide changes in health care access and delivery. Elective appointments and procedures have been canceled or delayed, and multiple states still have some degree of shelter-in-place orders. Many institutions are now relying more heavily on telehealth services to continue to provide medical care to individuals while also preserving the safety of health care professionals and patients. Telemedicine can also help reduce the surge in health care needs and visits as restrictions are lifted. In recent weeks, there has been a significant amount of information and advice on how to best approach telemedicine visits. Given the frequent presentation of individuals with musculoskeletal complaints to the medical practitioner, it is important to have a framework for the virtual musculoskeletal physical examination. This will be of importance as telemedicine continues to evolve, even after coronavirus disease 2019 restrictions are lifted. This article will provide the medical practitioner performing a virtual musculoskeletal examination with a specific set of guidelines, both written and visual, to enhance the information obtained when evaluating the shoulder, hip, knee, ankle, and cervical and lumbar spine. In addition to photographs, accompanying videos are included to facilitate and demonstrate specific physical examination techniques that the patient can self-perform.","Laskowski, Edward R.; Johnson, Shelby E.; Shelerud, Randy A.; Lee, Jason A.; Rabatin, Amy E.; Driscoll, Sherilyn W.; Moore, Brittany J.; Wainberg, Michael C.; Terzic, Carmen M.",Mayo Clin Proc,274,14

To counter its growing energy demand, the country is progressively adopting renewable energy technologies, although conventional energy technologies still play a central role in its electricity production. The huge solar energy potential in Algeria can be exploited and utilized to meet the country’s growing energy demand with minimal greenhouse gas production. Given that concentrating solar power is viewed as one of the most promising alternatives in the field of solar energy utilization, this study investigates the viability of a 100 MW parabolic trough-based power plant at Tamanrasset, Algeria. The plant was simulated in the System Advisor Model software considering the actual electricity load profile of the targeted location and implementing two different condenser types: evaporative and air-cooled. By comparing the plant’s electricity production to the city’s real load, the plant was in position of supplying about 78% and 60% of the city’s electricity demand during the winter and summer seasons, respectively. The results show that implementation of such CSP plants could play an important role in meeting the energy demand as well as mitigating climate change through greenhouse emissions avoided in electricity generation process.","Benhadji Serradj, D.

A secondary objective was to explore changes in PrEP use and the need for PrEP follow-up. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey. The questionnaire was available in Dutch, French and English, between April 10 and 27 (2020), and disseminated via sexual health and lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer or intersex organisations throughout Belgium. Eligibility criteria included being 18 years or older, not being exclusively heterosexual and living or being born in Belgium. RESULTS: The sample included 694 MSM. Physical sex with non-steady partners decreased from 59.1% to 8.9% during the first weeks of the lockdown. Those who had sex with non-steady partners were significantly more likely to be HIV positive, to use PrEP or to have engaged in sexual practices such as group sex, chemsex and sex work before the lockdown, compared with their counterparts. Among those who used PrEP before the lockdown, 47.0% stopped using PrEP, 19.7% used event-driven PrEP and 33.3% used daily PrEP during the lockdown. Almost two-thirds of PrEP users had a PrEP care appointment in the weeks before the lockdown and a minority received follow-up elsewhere or online. Some PrEP users had concerns regarding their follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: MSM in our survey substantially reduced sexual contact with non-steady partners during the first weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown, suggesting that the risk for HIV and STI transmission in this period was low. We recommend ensuring access to sexual health services, such as HIV testing and follow-up for PrEP for the small group having multiple sex partners and engaging in sexual practices such as chemsex, or group sex, even in times of a pandemic threat.","Reyniers, Thijs; Rotsaert, Anke; Thunissen, Estrelle; Buffel, Veerle; Masquillier, Caroline; Van Landeghem, Ella; Vanhamel, Jef; Nöstlinger, Christiana; Wouters, Edwin; Laga, Marie; Vuylsteke, Bea",Sex Transm Infect,274,32

However, the small sample size of infected patients enrolled in most studies did not allow to draw robust conclusions on the COVID-19 impact in PD. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess whether the prevalence and outcome of COVID-19 in PD patients are different from those observed in the general population. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies reporting data on PD patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (PD-COVID+). We extracted prevalence, clinical-demographic data, outcome, and mortality. We also analyzed risk or protective factors based on comparisons between PD-COVID+ and control populations with PD without COVID-19 or without PD with COVID-19. RESULTS: We included 16 studies reporting on a total of 11,325 PD patients, 1,061 with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The median infection prevalence ranged from 0.6% to 8.5%. PD-COVID+ patients had a median age of 74 and a disease duration of 9.4 years. Pooling all PD-COVID+ patients from included studies, 28.6% required hospitalization, 37.1% required levodopa dose increasing, and 18.9% died. The case fatality was higher in PD-COVID+ patients than the general population, with longer PD duration as a possible risk factor for worse outcome. Amantadine and vitamin D were proposed as potential protective factors. CONCLUSION: Available studies indicate a higher case fatality in PD patients affected by COVID-19 than the general population. Conversely, current literature does not definitively clarify whether PD patients are more susceptible to get infected. The potential protective role of vitamin D and amantadine is intriguing but deserves further investigation.","Artusi, Carlo Alberto; Romagnolo, Alberto; Ledda, Claudia; Zibetti, Maurizio; Rizzone, Mario Giorgio; Montanaro, Elisa; Bozzali, Marco; Lopiano, Leonardo",Journal of Parkinson's disease,274,3
