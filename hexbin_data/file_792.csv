Our aim is to compare outcomes between non-invasive ventilation (NIV), high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), and standard oxygen in patients at high-risk for or with established postoperative respiratory failure. METHODS: Electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were reviewed from inception to September 2019. We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared NIV, HFNC, and standard oxygen in patients at high risk for or with established postoperative respiratory failure. We performed a Bayesian network meta-analysis to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and Bayesian 95% credible intervals (CrIs). RESULTS: Nine RCTs representing 1865 patients were included (the mean age was 61.6 ± 10.2 and 64.4% were males). In comparison with standard oxygen, NIV was associated with a significant reduction in intubation rate (OR 0.23; 95% Cr.I. 0.10–0.46), mortality (OR 0.45; 95% Cr.I. 0.27–0.71), and intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infections (OR 0.43, 95% Cr.I. 0.25–0.70). Compared to standard oxygen, HFNC was associated with a significant reduction in intubation rate (OR 0.28, 95% Cr.I. 0.08–0.76) and ICU-acquired infections (OR 0.41; 95% Cr.I. 0.20–0.80), but not mortality (OR 0.58; 95% Cr.I. 0.26–1.22). There were no significant differences between HFNC and NIV regarding different outcomes. In a subgroup analysis, we observed a mortality benefit with NIV over standard oxygen in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgeries but not in abdominal surgeries. Furthermore, in comparison with standard oxygen, NIV and HFNC were associated with lower intubation rates following cardiothoracic surgeries while only NIV reduced the intubation rates following abdominal surgeries. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with post-operative respiratory failure, HFNC and NIV were associated with significantly reduced rates of intubation and ICU-acquired infections compared with standard oxygen. Moreover, NIV was associated with reduced mortality in comparison with standard oxygen.","Zayed, Yazan; Kheiri, Babikir; Barbarawi, Mahmoud; Rashdan, Laith; Gakhal, Inderdeep; Ismail, Esra’a; Kerbage, Josiane; Rizk, Fatima; Shafi, Saadia; Bala, Areeg; Sidahmed, Shima; Bachuwa, Ghassan; Seedahmed, Elfateh",J Intensive Care,792,16

However, where policy problems are “wicked” (systemic, ambiguous, complex, and conflictual), politics trumps evidence and solutions are never first best or permanent. Applying an EBP approach to solving wicked problems (WPs) therefore appears to be a daunting, impossible task. Despite the difficulties, we contend that blending insights from the EBP and WP literatures can provide actionable and practical policy advice to governments and MNEs for dealing with the WPs of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We support our thesis with a case study applying EBP to the WP of SDG 5 Gender Equality. We compare the statistical evidence from gender inequality indexes to SDG 5’s targets and indicators. We provide five insights from the EBP and WP literatures into why and how good evidence is necessary but not sufficient for progress on SDG 5. Building on these insights, we recommend that governments adopt an EBP approach employing public–private partnerships to address SDG 5. We also recommend that MNE executives use our new SDG Materiality Matrix, designed on EBP principles, to build SDG 5 into their global corporate social responsibility strategies.","Eden, Lorraine; Wagstaff, M.

We have also included a comprehensive review of hepatitis E in pregnancy. RECENT FINDINGS: European Association for the Study of the Liver established clinical practice guidelines for testing and treatment of suspected hepatitis E virus infections in 2018. Evidence suggests chronic hepatitis E may follow a course similar to hepatitis B/C with progression to cirrhosis and possibly hepatocellular carcinoma in immunocompromised patients. SUMMARY: Hepatitis E virus is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide. A combination of serology and nucleic acid amplification testing is the recommended strategy for suspected patients. Ribavirin therapy for a period of 3 months is the drug of choice for severe acute hepatitis, acute-on chronic liver failure, and chronic infections from hepatitis E virus in immunocompromised patients who are unresponsive to decreased immunosuppression. PEGylated interferon α can be used for ribavirin-resistant liver transplant patients with chronic hepatitis E. Further research in therapeutic options is essential considering the stormy course of hepatitis E infection during pregnancy and teratogenicity of all available options.","Kar, P.; Karna, R.",Curr Treat Options Infect Dis,792,16

To evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy of skill mix of nurses and other health care professionals in primary health care. METHODS. Systematic review of the literature aligned with the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), including observational and intervention studies. No restrictions were established for period or country of publication; studies published in Spanish, English and Portuguese were included. The search was carried out in MEDLINE, CINAHL, LILACS, EMBASE and Web of Science electronic databases. RESULTS. Eighteen studies were analyzed, including 6 from the United States; 3 from the Netherlands; 2 from the United Kingdom; 1 each from Australia, South Africa, South Korea, Scotland, Haiti and Japan; and 1 study with a prospective observational design from 8 countries. The studies reported that the skill mix among health professionals enables a better use of material resources; optimizes time spent on care; improves adhesion to treatment, quality of care and commitment and satisfaction with the work; and reduces the level of psychological distress in nursing professionals. CONCLUSIONS. The expansion of tasks of nurses and other health care professionals, and the skill mix as well as the development of interprofessional teams, are strategies that help to face a scarcity and poor distribution of human resources in urban and non-urban areas with improvement of the health care of the population and satisfaction of professionals and clients.","Cassiani, Silvia Helena De Bortoli; Fernandes, Maria Neyrian de Fátima; Reveiz, Ludovic; Filho, José Rodrigues Freire; da Silva, Fernando Antônio Menezes",Rev Panam Salud Publica,792,16

The aim of the study is to explore the efficacy and security of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in the treatment of neonatal sepsis-related AKI. METHOD: Totally12 sepsis-related AKI neonates treated with CRRT were hospitalized in the NICU of Shanghai Children’s Hospital between November 2012 and November 2019, and the clinical data of these 12 cases were retrospectively analyzed. Renal function, acid-base balance, electrolytes, blood pressure and hemodynamics indexes were recorded before CRRT initiation, 12/24/48 h after CRRT initiation and at the end of CRRT respectively. The efficacy of CRRT was evaluated and the clinical outcome was observed in these 12 sepsis-related AKI neonates. Repeated measurement analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis of the data. RESULT: (1) Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis filtration (CVVHDF) was used in 12 cases of sepsis-related AKI neonates. There were 6 cases with oliguria, 3 cases with fluid overload (FO), 3 cases with septic shock. The duration of CRRT was 49 ~ 110 h, average (76.2 ± 23.5) h. (2) The blood pressure (BP) of 12 sepsis -related AKI neonates could reach the normal level (40–60 mmHg) 12 h after CRRT initiation, and the normal BP level could be maintained during the CRRT treatment. After 12 h CRRT, the blood pH value increased to the normal range (7.35 ~ 7.45). After 12 h CRRT treatment, the oxygenation index of 12sepsis-related AKI neonates could reach 200 mmHg. After 24 h CRRT treatment, it could rise to more than 300 mmHg. Serum potassium, serum urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels decreased significantly 12 h after CRRT initiation, and reached the normal range 24 h after CRRT initiation. The urine volume significantly increased 24 h after CRRT initiation. (3) Venous catheterization was performed successfully in all sepsis-related AKI neonates. We observed 2 cases of thrombocytopenia, 1 case of obstruction and 1 case of hypotension in the course of CRRT. There were no complications such as hypothermia, hemorrhage, thrombosis and infection.11 neonates were cured and discharged. One neonate was treated with CRRT and passed through the oliguria stage of AKI, but died after the parents gave up the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: It is safe and effective to treat neonatal sepsis-related AKI with CRRT, which should be an effective measure for the treatment of sepsis-related AKI neonates.","Cai, Cheng; Qiu, Gang; Hong, Wenchao; Shen, Yunlin; Gong, Xiaohui",BMC Nephrol,792,26

Quality improvement tools such as checklists concisely articulate best practices with the aim of improving quality and safety; however, these tools have not been designed for the specific needs of patients with prolonged ICU stay. The primary objective of this review will be to determine the characteristics including format and content of multicomponent tools designed to standardise or improve ICU care. Secondary objectives are to describe the outcomes reported in these tools, the type of patients and settings studied, and to understand how these tools were developed and implemented in clinical practice. METHODS: We will search the Cochrane Library, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, OpenGrey, NHS evidence and Trial Registries from January 2000 onwards. We will include primary research studies (e.g. experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and qualitative studies) recruiting more than 10 adult participants admitted to ICUs, high dependency units and weaning centres regardless of length of stay, describing quality improvement tools such as structured care plans or checklists designed to standardize more than one aspect of care delivery. We will extract data on study and patient characteristics, tool design and implementation strategies and measured outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen citations for eligible studies and perform data extraction. Data will be synthesised with descriptive statistics; we will use a narrative synthesis to describe review findings. DISCUSSION: The findings will be used to guide development of tools for use with prolonged ICU stay patients. Our group will use experience-based co-design methods to identify the most important actionable processes of care to include in quality improvement tools these patients. Such tools are needed to standardise practice and thereby improve quality of care. Illustrating the development and implementation methods used for such tools will help to guide translation of similar tools into ICU clinical practice and future research.

The 2018 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on eligibility for preventive therapy to treat latent TB infection (LTBI) include people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV), household contacts of TB patients including children, and those with clinical conditions including silicosis, dialysis, transplantation, etc. and other country-specific groups. We aimed to estimate the potential impact of full implementation of these guidelines in the WHO South-East Asian (SEA) Region, which bears the largest burden of TB and LTBI amongst the WHO regions. METHODS: We developed mathematical models of TB transmission dynamics, calibrated individually to each of the 11 countries in the region. We modelled preventive therapy in the absence of other TB interventions. As an alternative comparator, reflecting ongoing developments in TB control in the region, we also simulated improvements in the treatment cascade for active TB, including private sector engagement and intensified case-finding. Relative to both scenarios, for each country in the region, we projected TB cases and deaths averted between 2020 and 2030, by full uptake of preventive therapy, defined as comprehensive coverage amongst eligible populations as per WHO guidelines, and assuming outcomes consistent with clinical trials. We also performed sensitivity analysis to illustrate impact under less-than-optimal conditions. RESULTS: At the regional level, full uptake of preventive therapy amongst identified risk groups would reduce annual incidence rates in 2030 by 8.30% (95% CrI 6.48–10.83) relative to 2015, in the absence of any additional interventions. If implemented against a backdrop of improved TB treatment cascades, preventive therapy would achieve an incremental 6.93 percentage points (95% CrI 5.81–8.51) of reduction in annual incidence rates, compared to 2015. At the regional level, the numbers of individuals with latent TB infection that need to be treated to avert 1 TB case is 64 (95% CrI 55–74). Sensitivity analysis illustrates that results for impact are roughly proportional to ‘effective coverage’ (the product of actual coverage and effectiveness of the regimen). CONCLUSIONS: Full implementation of WHO guidelines is important for ending TB in the SEA Region. Although future strategies will need to be expanded to the population level, to achieve large declines in TB incidence, the uptake of current tools can offer a valuable step in this direction.","Mandal, Sandip; Bhatia, Vineet; Sharma, Mukta; Mandal, Partha Pratim; Arinaminpathy, Nimalan",BMC Med,792,24

Since both cardiovascular and renal disease, and polypharmacy, are common in ageing people with HIV, there is a need for alternative efficacious regimens. bPI-based regimens are often the treatment of choice for individuals with pre-treatment or treatment-acquired resistance but it is plausible that carefully selected HIV-positive individuals with drug resistance, who are virologically suppressed on their current bPI regimen, could maintain virological efficacy when switched to bictegravir, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) fixed dose combination (FDC). METHODS/DESIGN: A phase IV, investigator-initiated, multicentre, open label pilot, randomised two-arm study to assess the safety and efficacy of switching from bPI regimen to B/F/TAF single tablet regimen in integrase inhibitor-naïve, virologically suppressed adults with HIV-1 infection harbouring drug resistance mutations. Eligible individuals will either continue on their bPI regimen or switch to B/F/TAF FDC. After 24 weeks, all participants in the bPI arm will be switched to B/F/TAF and followed for a further 24 weeks and all participants will be followed for 48 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at week 24 using pure virologic response whilst the secondary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48. Other secondary outcome measures include between arm comparisons of drug resistance at virological failure, safety and tolerability and patient-reported outcome measures. DISCUSSION: We aim to provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy of switching to B/F/TAF in patients with virological suppression on a bPI-based regimen who harbour select drug resistance mutations.

In recent years, adjuvant compounds derived from plants have been used for improving the immunogenicity of vaccines. Glycyrrhizin (GL) is a natural triterpenoid saponin that has known immunomodulatory activities. In the present study, we investigated the effects of co-treatment with FML and GL on the production of cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) by macrophages, in vitro. METHODS: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated murine peritoneal macrophages were treated with FML (5 μg/ml) of L. infantum and various concentrations of GL (1 μg/ml, 10 μg/ml and 20 μg/ml). After 48 h of treatment, cell culture supernatants were recovered and the levels of TNF-α, IL-10, IL-12p70 and IP-10 were measured by sandwich ELISA and NO concentration by Griess reaction. RESULTS: Our results indicate that the treatment of activated macrophages with FML plus GL leads to enhanced production of NO, TNF-α and IL-12p70, and reduction of IL-10 levels in comparison with FML treatment alone. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, we concluded that GL can improve the immunostimulatory effect of FML on macrophages and leads to their polarization towards an M1-like phenotype.

In the critically ill patients, it is one of the most frequently done procedure especially in intensive care unit (ICU) for those requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. About 24% of all patients in ICU need tracheostomy (Esteban et al. in Am J Respir Crit Care Med 161:1450–1458, 2000). Historically it had a high complication rate and so many authors suggested that it should be done only in operating room (Dayal and Masri in Laryngoscope 96:5862, 1986). A standardized procedure to reduce complications was described by Jackson (Laryngoscope 19:285–290, 1909). The aim of the study is to observe and analyze the outcome of bedside open tracheostomy, in relation to its safety, complications and simplicity. Study consists of 200 patients who underwent bedside tracheostomies in a tertiary care center from 2014 to 2017 in medical/surgical/paediatric ICU’s. All the procedures followed a standard protocol. In all the surgeries, two E.N.T. surgeons were scrubbed and did the procedure, assisted by two ICU nurses. One anesthetist who administered sedation and monitored the patient. If coagulation disturbances were present in elective case then they were corrected prior to the procedure. We all want the latest, safest, simplest and cheapest available technique in medical practice. Bedside tracheostomy is one such procedure. It is better than tracheostomy in operating room for patients who need prolonged mechanical ventilation in ICU as it eliminates the need of patient transport to OR and its associated complications and also minimizing cost. Training programs need to be provided to the assisting staff for better procedural outcome.","Sinha, Vikas; Jha, Sushil G.; Umesh, Samanth Talagauara; Chaudhari, Nirav P.; Parmar, Bhagirathsinh D.; Patel, Rashmin S.",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,792,16
37112,37112,37112,Responding to Covid-19: Lessons from Management Research,8.197073,0.873081,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Antipsychotic medications have been widely used in nursing homes to manage behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, despite significantly increased mortality risk. Use grew rapidly during the 2000s, reaching 23.9% of residents by 2011. A national campaign for safer dementia care in U.S. nursing homes was launched in 2012, with public reporting of quality measures, increased regulatory scrutiny, and accompanying state and facility initiatives. By the second quarter of 2019, use had declined by 40.1% to 14.3%. We assessed the impact of state and facility initiatives during the Campaign aimed at encouraging more-judicious prescribing of antipsychotic medications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Our mixed-methods strategy integrated administrative and clinical data analyses with state and facility case studies. RESULTS: Results suggest that substantial change in prescribing is achievable through sustained, data-informed quality improvement initiatives integrating educational and regulatory interventions, supported by public quality reporting. Adequate staffing, particularly of registered nurses, is key to support individualized management of symptoms through nonpharmacological strategies. Case study results suggest that state and facility initiatives during the campaign achieved considerable buy-in for the goal of more conservative prescribing, through a social process of normalization. Reporting and reduction of antipsychotic use was not followed by increases in sedative-hypnotic medication use. Rather, sedative-hypnotic use declined in tandem with antipsychotic reduction, suggesting that increased attention to prescribing patterns led to more cautious use of other risky psychotropic medications. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Quality improvement initiatives to change entrenched but problematic clinical practices face many barriers to success, including provider-level inertia; perceptions that alternatives are not available; and family and staff resistance. Nevertheless, systemic change is possible through concerted, collaborative efforts that touch prescribing practices at multiple points; integrate educational and regulatory influences; activate local and state champions for improvement; foster reputational influences through public reporting and benchmarking; and support a social process of normalization of preferred care processes as a best practice that is in the interest of patients.","Crystal, Stephen; Jarrín, Olga F; Rosenthal, Marsha; Hermida, Richard; Angell, Beth",Innov Aging,792,16

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Placental epigenetic mechanisms may be involved, but no prior epigenome-wide studies have investigated the impact of maternal POPs on placental DNA methylation. We studied the association between maternal plasma POP concentration in early pregnancy and epigenome-wide placental DNA methylation among 260 pregnant women from the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies. RESULTS: Our analysis focused on POPs with more than 80% plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification, including 3 organochlorine pesticides (hexachlorobenzene, trans-nonachlor, p,p’-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene), 1 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE 47), 3 polychlorinated biphenyls (138/158, 153, 180), and 6 poly- and perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) (perfluorodecanoic acid, perfluorohexanesulfonic acid, perfluorononanoic acid, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA)). Using 5% false discovery rate, POPs were associated with a total of 214 differentially methylated CpG sites (nominal p values ranging from 2.61 × 10(−21) to 2.11 × 10(−7)). Out of the 214 CpG sites, 24 (11%) were significantly correlated with placental expression of 21 genes. Notably, higher PFUnDA was associated with increased methylation at 3 CpG sites (cg13996963, cg12089439, cg18145877) annotated to TUSC3, and increased methylation at those 3 CpG sites was correlated with decreased expression of TUSC3 in the placenta. Increased methylation at cg18145877 (TUSC3) and decreased expression of TUSC3 were correlated with shorter birth length. Out of the 214 CpG sites, methylation at 44 CpG sites was correlated (p value < 0.10) with at least one neonatal anthropometry measure (i.e., birth weight, birth length, and head circumference). Seven CpG sites mediated (p value < 0.05) the association between PBDE 47 and neonatal anthropometry measures. Genes annotating the top differentially methylated CpG sites were enriched in pathways related to differentiation of embryonic cells (PBDE 47) and in pathways related to brain size and brain morphology (PFASs). CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation changes in the placenta were significantly associated with maternal plasma POPs concentration. The findings suggest that placental DNA methylation and gene expression mechanism may be involved in the prenatal toxicity of POPs and their association with neonatal anthropometry measures.","Ouidir, Marion; Mendola, Pauline; Buck Louis, Germaine M.; Kannan, Kurunthachalam; Zhang, Cuilin; Tekola-Ayele, Fasil",Clin Epigenetics,792,16

In particular healthcare services (HCS) are facing a great stress-test worldwide. The present work aims to explore what were health needs, beyond COVID, not covered among Italian citizens, due to fear, lockdown measures and overload of HCS, also in order to understand if there are specific subgroups of populations that will need urgent access to health services in the next future. METHODS: COCOS (COvid COllateral impactS) is a cross-sectional study performed during the Italian lockdown between April and May 2020. A forty-nine items online questionnaire was filled by the respondents. Participation was voluntary and without compensation. Informed consents were obtained. Descriptive, univariable and multivariable (logistic regression models) analyses were performed: results are expressed in ORs. RESULTS: Totally, 1,515 questionnaires were collected. Median age was 42 years, 65.6% were females. Around 22% declared to suffer from chronic diseases. Interestingly, 32.4% of the sample faced a delay of a scheduled Medical Service (MS) by provider decision, while 25.6% reported that this issue hit a family member. More than 13% refused to access scheduled MS for the fear of contagion, and the 6.5% avoided HCS even if having an acute onset issue: this behavior was associated with scarce trust in physicians (AdjOR 0.75); alarmingly, 1.5% avoided Emergency Department when in need and 5% of the sample took medications without consulting any physician: patients suffering from chronic conditions resulted to be more prone to self-medication (AdjOR: 2.16; 95% C.I.: 1.16-4.02). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 immediate effects are just the tip of the iceberg. Large groups of population suffered delays and interruptions of medical services, and the most vulnerable were the most affected. To estimate the effects of the pandemic on non-COVID-19 patients is required, leading to aimed efforts, to reduce the backlog that HCS incurred in. KEY MESSAGES: COVID-19 biggest toll on public health is still to come if not prevented, due to temporary but widespread suspensions of scheduled medical services and the avoidance of these for fear of contagion. The most in need are the most vulnerable: older patients and those with chronic conditions are the most affected by suspension of medical services and will potentially pay the greatest cost.","Gualano, M R; Corradi, A; Voglino, G; Bert, F; Siliquini, R",Eur J Public Health,792,1

This is the first integrative review of literature on veterinary communication. Applying the PRISMA model, the PubMed, PsychInfo and ERIC databases were searched using keywords such as ‘veterinary’, ‘vet’, ‘communication’ and ‘interaction’ for related articles published between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2018. RESULTS: Keyword searching through the databases yielded 1572 related studies. Only 48 of these studies were included in our analysis after an in-depth review by two independent reviewers using the critical appraisal skills Programme frameworks with high inter-rater reliability (Cohen’s kappa coefficient κ > 0.8). The existing body of research on veterinary communication can be classified into three major areas: (a) client–veterinarian communication, (b) cross-disciplinary communication in a professional veterinarian team and (c) training of veterinary communication skills. This review details the complexity and heterogeneity of agenda in the field of veterinary communication. The included studies indicate that veterinary practitioners are not equipped with specific communication skills to address different agendas in veterinary communication. The veterinary curriculum should include a component on communication training that can help veterinary students acquire necessary communication skills that allow them to effectively communicate with clients and other professionals CONCLUSION: This review detailed the complexity of agendas in the field of veterinary communication. The results indicate that veterinary practitioners can further benefit from training on specific communication skills that address the agendas found in veterinary communication research. Furthermore, the veterinary curriculum should include a component on communication training that equips veterinary students with the necessary communication skills that allow them to effectively communicate with different stakeholders such as clients and colleagues with and across the field of veterinary science.","PUN, Jack K.

While the majority of individuals who have experienced traumatic bereavements do not meet formal criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD), or prolonged grief disorder (PGD), the degree of distress and dysfunction for these bereaved can be quite significant. The assessment and intervention paradigms in use with traumatic bereavements often prioritize the trauma and bypass the centrality of the interpersonal loss. By using a bifocal approach in conceptualizing bereavement, the Two-Track Model of Bereavement (TTMB) rebalances the approach to the class of traumatic bereavements. Track I examines biopsychosocial functioning and symptoms of trauma, and track II focuses on the nature of the ongoing relationship with the deceased and the death story that may also have elements of traumatic response. The model and its application serve to identify both adaptive and maladaptive responses to loss along both axes to optimally focus interventions where needed. The story of the death, the psychological relationship with the deceased, and the presence of biopsychosocial difficulties each have a part to play in assessment and intervention. A case study of assessment and intervention following traumatic bereavement due to suicide illustrates how attention to each of these factors in the TTMB can facilitate change. Ultimately, the relational bond with the deceased is a major vector in grief and mourning. Assessment and intervention with traumatic bereavements require attention to dysfunction and symptoms of trauma as well as to the death story and the state of the relationship to the deceased.","Rubin, Simon Shimshon; Malkinson, Ruth; Witztum, Eliezer",Front Psychiatry,792,13

Early screening of viral infection among the population has the potential to combat the spread of infection. However, the traditional methods of virus detection being used currently, such as plate culturing and quantitative RT-PCR, give promising results, but they are time-consuming and require expert analysis and costly equipment and reagents; therefore, they are not affordable by people in low socio-economic groups in developing countries. Further, mass or bulk testing chosen by many governments to tackle the pandemic situation has led to severe shortages of testing kits and reagents and hence are affecting the demand and supply chain drastically. We tried to include all the reported current scenario-based biosensors such as electrochemical, optical, and microfluidics, which have the potential to replace mainstream diagnostic methods and therefore could pave the way to combat COVID-19. Apart from this, we have also provided information on commercially available biosensors for detection of SARS-CoV-2 along with the challenges in development of better diagnostic approaches. It is therefore expected that the content of this review will help researchers to design and develop more sensitive advanced commercial biosensor devices for early diagnosis of viral infection, which can open up avenues for better and more specific therapeutic outcomes.","Parihar, Arpana; Ranjan, Pushpesh; Sanghi, Sunil K.; Srivastava, Avanish K.; Khan, Raju",ACS Appl Bio Mater,792,1

Despite its complex geometrical structure and complicate wall movements, the advanced calculation simulations can provide valuable results to accurately predict the aerosol deposition in this region. The objective of this study was to numerically investigate the aerosol particle transport and deposition in the intra-acinar region of a human lung for different breathing scenarios (i.e., light, normal, and heavy activities) during multiple breaths. Idealized intra-acinar models utilized in this study consisted of a respiratory bronchial model, an alveolar duct model, and an alveolar sac model. The particles with 5 μm in diameter released from the inlet of the model were tracked until they deposited or escaped from the computational domain. The results showed that due to the rhythmic alveolar wall movement, the flow field was divided into two regions: one is the low-speed alveolar flow and the other is the channel flow. It was found that the chaotic acinar flow irreversibility played a significant role in the aerosol transport in higher generations. During the succeeding breaths, more particles deposited or escaped to the relating acinar generation and reached the more distal regions of the lung. The number of particles remaining in the suspension at the end of the third cycle ranged from 0.016% to 3%. When the mouth flow rate increased, the number of particles remaining in the suspension reduced, resulting in higher deposition efficiency. The total deposition efficiencies for each flow rate were 24%, 47%, and 77%, respectively. The particle simulation results also showed that more breathing cycle was required for full aerosol particle deposition or escape from the model. In addition to the alveolar wall motion, the type of breathing condition and breathing cycle had a significant effect on the accurate prediction of the aerosol deposition in the intra-acinar region of the human lung.","Ciloglu, Dogan",Phys Fluids (1994),792,1

DESIGN: Narrative review. SETTING: Non-institutionalized community-living people. PARTICIPANTS: 20.069 individuals from ten descriptive cross-sectional papers. MEASUREMENTS: Articles since 2019 to 2020 published on Pubmed, Scielo and Google Scholar databases with the following MeSh terms (‘COVID-19’, ‘coronavirus’, ‘aging’, ‘older people’, ‘elderly’, ‘social isolation’ and ‘quarantine’) in English, Spanish or Portuguese were included. The studies not including people over 60 were excluded. Guidelines, recommendations, and update documents from different international organizations related to mental and physical activity were also analysed. RESULTS: 41 documents have been included in this narrative review, involving a total of 20.069 individuals (58% women), from Asia, Europe and America. 31 articles included recommendations and 10 addressed the impact of social distancing on mental or physical health. The main outcomes reported were anxiety, depression, poor sleep quality and physical inactivity during the isolation period. Cognitive strategies and increasing physical activity levels using apps, online videos, telehealth, are the main international recommendations.

Whilst many infections are asymptomatic, it is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly for immunocompromised people and for infants who are congenitally infected. A vaccine against CMV has been stated as a public health priority, but there are gaps in our understanding of CMV epidemiology. To guide potential future vaccination strategies, our aim was to examine risk factors for CMV seropositivity in young people in England. METHODS: The Health Survey for England (HSE) is an annual, cross-sectional representative survey of households in England during which data are collected through questionnaires, and blood samples are taken. We randomly selected individuals who participated in the HSE 2002, aiming for 25 participants of each sex in each single year age group from 11 to 24 years. Stored samples were tested for CMV antibodies. We undertook descriptive and regression analyses of CMV seroprevalence and risk factors for infection. RESULTS: Demographic data and serostatus were available for 732 individuals, of whom 175 (23.7%) were CMV-seropositive. CMV seroprevalence was associated with age, with 18.3% seropositive at 11–14 years compared to 28.3% at 22–24 years. CMV serostatus was also higher in people of non-white ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.47–11.14), and in adults who were seropositive for EBV (aOR 2.08 [1.06–4.09]). There was no evidence that smoking status, occupation, body mass index and region of England were associated with CMV serostatus. CONCLUSIONS: CMV seroprevalence is strongly associated with ethnicity, and modestly increases with age in 11–24-year-olds. A greater understanding of the transmission dynamics of CMV, and the impact of this on CMV-associated morbidity and mortality, is necessary to inform effective vaccination strategies when a vaccine for CMV becomes available.","Winter, Joanne R.; Taylor, Graham S.; Thomas, Olivia G.; Jackson, Charlotte; Lewis, Joanna E.

They may also serve as biomarkers of various disease states or important therapeutic targets. Breast cancer EVs have the potential to change the behavior of other cells in their microenvironment. However, the proteomic content of EVs isolated from young women’s breast cancer patients and the mechanisms underlying the influence of EVs on tumor cell behavior have not yet been reported. METHODS: In our current translational studies, we compared the proteomic content of EVs isolated from invasive breast cancer cell lines and plasma samples from young women’s breast cancer (YWBC) patients and age-matched healthy donors using mass spectrometry. We analyzed the functionality of EVs in two dimensional tumor cell invasion assays and the gene expression changes in tumor cells after incubation with EVs. RESULTS: We found that treatment with EVs from both invasive breast cancer cell lines and plasma of YWBC patients altered the invasive properties of non-invasive breast cancer cells. Proteomics identified differences between EVs from YWBC patients and healthy donors that correlated with their altered function. Further, we identified gene expression changes in non-invasive breast cancer cells after treatment with EVs that implicate the Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) signaling pathway as a potential targetable pathway affected by breast cancer-derived EVs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the proteome of EVs from breast cancer patients reflects their functionality in tumor motility assays and may help elucidate the role of EVs in breast cancer progression.","Jordan, Kimberly R.; Hall, Jessica K.; Schedin, Troy; Borakove, Michelle; Xian, Jenny J.; Dzieciatkowska, Monika; Lyons, Traci R.; Schedin, Pepper; Hansen, Kirk C.; Borges, Virginia F.",Breast Cancer Res,792,16

Today, around 215 countries are affected by COVID-19 disease. WHO announced approximately number of cases 11,274,600 worldwide. Due to rapidly rising cases daily in the hospitals, there are a limited number of resources available to control COVID-19 disease. Therefore, it is essential to develop an accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 patients is important for preventing the disease from spreading to others. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning based approach that can differentiate COVID- 19 disease patients from viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and healthy (normal) cases. In this approach, deep transfer learning is adopted. We used binary and multi-class dataset which is categorized in four types for experimentation: (i) Collection of 728 X-ray images including 224 images with confirmed COVID-19 disease and 504 normal condition images (ii) Collection of 1428 X-ray images including 224 images with confirmed COVID-19 disease, 700 images with confirmed common bacterial pneumonia, and 504 normal condition images. (iii) Collections of 1442 X- ray images including 224 images with confirmed COVID-19 disease, 714 images with confirmed bacterial and viral pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions (iv) Collections of 5232 X- ray images including 2358 images with confirmed bacterial and 1345 with viral pneumonia, and 1346 images of normal conditions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies were identified through searching in English databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science) and Chinese databases (Sinomed, WANFANG, CNKI, and CQVIP). A checklist for critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modeling studies (CHARMS) and the prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST) were used for the data extraction process and critical appraisal. RESULTS: From the 29,668 retrieved articles, eleven studies meeting the selection criteria were included in this review. Forty-eight predictors were identified from prognostic prediction models. The c-statistic ranged from 0.67 to 0.95. Critical appraisal has shown that all modeling studies were subject to a high risk of bias in methodological quality mainly driven by outcome and statistical analysis, and six modeling studies were subject to a high risk of bias in applicability. CONCLUSION: Future model development and validation studies should adhere to the transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement to improve methodological quality and applicability, thus increasing the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study. It is not appropriate to adopt any of the identified models in this study for clinical practice since all models are prone to optimism and overfitting.","Zhang, Hui; Shao, Jing; Chen, Dandan; Zou, Ping; Cui, Nianqi; Tang, Leiwen; Wang, Dan; Ye, Zhihong",Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,792,8

METHODS: A total of 60 patients with deglutition disorder after stroke were selected and divided into an electrical stimulation group, a massage group and an integrated group according to the random number table method, with 20 cases in each group. Patients in these three groups were given the same routine rehabilitation training for deglutition. In addition, patients in the electrical stimulation group were given extra Vitalstim electrical stimulation, patients in the massage group were given extra acupoint massage on the head, face and neck, and patients in the integrated group were given extra acupoint massage plus Vitalstim electrical stimulation. Fujishima Ichiro food intake level scale (FILS) was scored before and after treatment. The swallowing duration and maximal amplitude of masseter muscle in SEMG were evaluated before and after treatment. RESULTS: After treatment, the FILS score and the maximal amplitude of recruitment potential generated by muscular contraction of masseter muscle group in the three groups were higher than those before treatment (all P<0.05), and the swallowing duration of masseter muscle group was shortened compared with that in the same group before treatment (all P<0.05). After treatment, the FILS score in the integrated group was higher than that in the electrical stimulation group and the massage group (both P<0.05). The swallowing duration of masseter muscle group measured by SEMG was lower than that in the electrical stimulation group and the massage group (both P<0.05), while the maximal amplitude was higher than that of the electrical stimulation group and the massage group (P<0.05). After treatment, there were no significant differences in the FILS score, swallowing duration and maximal amplitude of masseter muscle group between the electrical stimulation group and the massage group (all P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Both acupoint massage and electrical stimulation can improve the deglutition function in patients with deglutition disorder after stroke, and improve the coordination and flexibility of masseter muscle. The integration of the two is more effective.","Tian, Li; Nie, Shao-tong; Lou, Tian-xiao; Chen, Huan; Yuan, Guang-hui",J,792,1

However, despite the high effectiveness of γ-Flu vaccines, the need to incorporate an adjuvant to improve vaccine-mediated protection seems inevitable. Here, we examined the protective efficacy of an intranasal gamma-irradiated HIN1 vaccine co-administered with a plasmid encoding mouse interleukin-28B (mIL-28B) as a novel adjuvant in BALB/c mice. Animals were immunized intranasally three times at one-week intervals with γ-Flu, alone or in combination with the mIL-28B adjuvant, followed by viral challenge with a high lethal dose (10 LD(50)) of A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) influenza virus. Virus-specific antibody, cellular and mucosal responses, and the balance of cytokines in the spleen IFN-γ, IL-12, and IL-4) and in lung homogenates (IL-6 and IL-10) were measured by ELISA. The lymphoproliferative activity of restimulated spleen cells was also determined by MTT assay. Furthermore, virus production in the lungs of infected mice was estimated using the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)/hemagglutination assay (HA). Our data showed that intranasal immunization with adjuvanted γ-Flu vaccine efficiently promoted humoral, cellular, and mucosal immune responses and efficiently decreased lung virus titers, all of which are associated with protection against challenge. This combination also reduced IL-6 and IL-10 levels in lung homogenates. The results suggest that IL-28B can enhance the ability of the vaccine to elicit virus-specific immune responses and could potentially be used as an effective adjuvant.","Sabbaghi, Ailar; Zargar, Mohsen; Zolfaghari, Mohammad Reza; Motamedi-Sedeh, Farahnaz; Ghaemi, Amir",Arch Virol,792,27

In nonclinical studies, cellular immune responses mediated by cytotoxic T cells may target vector-transduced cells, which could impact safety and efficacy. Here, we describe the bioanalytical validation of an interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)-based Enzyme-Linked Immunospot (ELISpot) assay for measuring T cell responses against viral antigens in cynomolgus monkeys. Since ELISpots performed with antigen-derived peptides offer a universal assay format, method performance characteristics were validated using widely available peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) responsive to cytomegalovirus peptides. The limit of detection and confirmatory cut point were established using statistical methods; precision, specificity, and linearity were confirmed. Monkey PBMCs from an AAV5 gene therapy study were then analyzed, using peptide pools spanning the vector capsid and transgene product. AAV5-specific T cell responses were detected only in 2 of 18 monkeys at Day 28, but not at Day 13 and 56 after vector administration, with no correlation to liver enzyme elevations or transgene expression levels. No transgene product-specific T cell responses occurred. In conclusion, while viral peptide-specific IFN-γ ELISpots can be successfully validated for monkey PBMCs, monitoring peripheral T cell responses in non-clinical AAV5 gene therapy studies was of limited value to interpret safety or efficacy.","Yang, Fan; Patton, Kathryn; Kasprzyk, Theresa; Long, Brian; Gupta, Soumi; Zoog, Stephen J.; Tracy, Kristin; Vettermann, Christian",Gene Ther,792,1

With the actual data in Georgia, USA, we obtained the related parameters such as the recovery rate and mortality rate. Then, the development of the novel coronavirus is investigated. For more accuracy, we consider the parameters in this model as the functions of the infected number and disease duration. These parameters’ functions are used to reflect the impact of disease development on parameters. Furthermore, the coefficients in these functions are regarded as uncertainties. To obtain these uncertain coefficients, the fuzzy set theory and confidence index theory are adopted. Thus, the fuzzy SEIR model is proposed.","Li, Chenming; Huang, Jin; Chen, Ye-Hwa; Zhao, Han",Int,792,16

Using an online questionnaire the current situation among German institutes for forensic medicine was evaluated. The return rate of the questionnaires was 80%. The results point at a preponderance of testing of factual knowledge. A change to testing of practical skills appears necessary to match the learning objectives of practical teaching. The evaluation results represent a high level of student contentment with teaching in forensic medicine. Clinical electives can be offered by more of 90% of the institutes.
