636,636,636,Immunodetection of occult eosinophils in lung tissue biopsies may help predict survival in acute lung injury,13.379087,8.917041,2011-08-26,"BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious respiratory disorder for which therapy is primarily supportive once infection is excluded. Surgical lung biopsy may rule out other diagnoses, but has not been generally useful for therapy decisions or prognosis in this setting. Importantly, tissue and peripheral blood eosinophilia, the hallmarks of steroid-responsive acute eosinophilic pneumonia, are not commonly linked with ALI. We hypothesized that occult eosinophilic pneumonia may explain better outcomes for some patients with ALI. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry using a novel monoclonal antibody recognizing eosinophil peroxidase (EPX-mAb) was used to assess intrapulmonary eosinophil accumulation/degranulation. Lung biopsies from ALI patients (n = 20) were identified following review of a pathology database; 45% of which (i.e., 9/20) displayed classical diffuse alveolar damage (ALI-DAD). Controls were obtained from uninvolved tissue in patients undergoing lobectomy for lung cancer (n = 10). Serial biopsy sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and subjected to EPX-mAb immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: EPX-mAb immunohistochemistry provided a >40-fold increased sensitivity to detect eosinophils in the lung relative to H&E stained sections. This increased sensitivity led to the identification of higher numbers of eosinophils in ALI patients compared with controls; differences using H&E staining alone were not significant. Clinical assessments showed that lung infiltrating eosinophil numbers were higher in ALI patients that survived hospitalization compared with non-survivors. A similar conclusion was reached quantifying eosinophil degranulation in each biopsy. CONCLUSION: The enhanced sensitivity of EPX-mAb immunohistochemistry uniquely identified eosinophil accumulation/degranulation in patients with ALI relative to controls. More importantly, this method was a prognostic indicator of patient survival. These observations suggest that EPX-mAb immunohistochemistry may represent a diagnostic biomarker identifying a subset of ALI patients with improved clinical outcomes.","Willetts, Lian; Parker, Kimberly; Wesselius, Lewis J; Protheroe, Cheryl A; Jaben, Elizabeth; Graziano, P; Moqbel, Redwan; Leslie, Kevin O; Lee, Nancy A; Lee, James J",Respir Res,86,1

855,855,855,Novel Evidence of HBV Recombination in Family Cluster Infections in Western China,13.656347,9.208335,2012-06-04,"Two hepatitis B virus (HBV) C/D recombinants were isolated from western China. No direct evidence indicates that these new viruses arose as a result of recombination between genotype C and D or a result of convergence. In this study, we search for evidence of intra-individual recombination in the family cluster cases with co-circulation of genotype C, D and C/D recombinants. We studied 68 individuals from 15 families with HBV infections in 2006, identified individuals with mixed HBV genotype co-infections by restriction fragment length polymorphism and proceeded with cloning and DNA sequencing. Recombination signals were detected by RDP3 software and confirmed by split phylogenetic trees. Families with mixed HBV genotype co-infections were resampled in 2007. Three of 15 families had individuals with different HBV genotype co-infections in 2006. One individual (Y2) had a triple infection of HBV genotype C, D and C/D recombinant in 2006, but only genotype D in 2007. Further clonal analysis of this patient indicated that the C/D recombinant was not identical to previously isolated CD1 or CD2, but many novel recombinants with C2, D1 and CD1 were simultaneously found. All parental strains could recombine with each other to form new recombinant in this patient. This indicates that the detectable mixed infection and recombination have a limited time window. Also, as the recombinant nature of HBV precludes the possibility of a simple phylogenetic taxonomy, a new standard may be required for classifying HBV sequences.","Zhou, Bin; Wang, Zhanhui; Yang, Jie; Sun, Jian; Li, Hua; Tanaka, Yasuhito; Mizokami, Masashi; Hou, Jinlin",PLoS One,86,1

The high incidence of treatment-related mortality and relapses, however, are important reasons for controversy about the role of allografting in the management of MM. We reviewed our results of allografting for MM spanning a period of 34 years in order to better define long-term outcomes and identify areas of progress as well as areas requiring improvement. A total of 278 patients received allogeneic marrow or PBSCs after high-dose myeloablative (N=144) or reduced intensity, non-myeloablative (N=134) regimens. In multivariable analysis, adjusting for differences in patient groups, reduced intensity/non-myeloablative transplants were associated with significantly less acute GVHD, lower transplant mortality, better PFS and overall survival. There were no significant differences in relapse, progression or chronic GVHD, when adjusted. In multivariable analysis of patients receiving only non-myeloablative transplants, decreased overall survival and PFS were associated with relapse after a prior autograft and a β2 microglobulin >4.0. Transplant mortality was reduced and only influenced by a prior tandem autograft.","Bensinger, W; Rotta, M; Storer, B; Chauncey, T; Holmberg, L; Becker, P; Sandmaier, B M; Storb, R; Maloney, D",Bone Marrow Transplant,86,1
1006,1006,1006,Host-protective effect of circulating pentraxin 3 (PTX3) and complex formation with neutrophil extracellular traps,13.57136,8.827699,2012-12-13,"Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a soluble pattern recognition receptor which is classified as a long-pentraxin in the pentraxin family. It is known to play an important role in innate immunity, inflammatory regulation, and female fertility. PTX3 is synthesized by specific cells, primarily in response to inflammatory signals. Among these various cells, neutrophils have a unique PTX3 production system. Neutrophils store PTX3 in neutrophil-specific granules and then the stored PTX3 is released and localizes in neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Although certain NET components have been identified, such as histones and anti-microbial proteins, the detailed mechanisms by which NETs localize, as well as capture and kill microbes, have not been fully elucidated. PTX3 is a candidate diagnostic marker of infection and vascular damage. In severe infectious diseases such as sepsis, the circulating PTX3 concentration increases greatly (up to 100 ng/mL, i.e., up to 100-fold of the normal level). Even though it is clearly implied that PTX3 plays a protective role in sepsis and certain other disorders, the detailed mechanisms by which it does so remain unclear. A proteomic study of PTX3 ligands in septic patients revealed that PTX3 forms a complex with certain NET component proteins. This suggests a role for PTX3 in which it facilitates the efficiency of anti-microbial protein pathogen clearance by interacting with both pathogens and anti-microbial proteins. We discuss the possible relationships between PTX3 and NET component proteins in the host protection afforded by the innate immune response. The PTX3 complex has the potential to be a highly useful diagnostic marker of sepsis and other inflammatory diseases.","Daigo, Kenji; Hamakubo, Takao",Front Immunol,86,1

The present study aimed to give an accurate picture of the 2012–2013 ILI outbreak in Corsica by combining data from several surveillance systems: general practice, emergency general practice, hospital emergency units, intensive care units, and nursing homes. Twenty-eight respiratory viruses were retrospectively investigated from patients in general practice with ILI. Sequence analysis of the genetic changes in the hemagglutinin gene of influenza viruses (A(H1N1)pdm2009, A(H3N2) and B) was performed. The trends in ILI/influenza consultation rates and the relative illness ratios (RIRs) of having an ILI consultation were estimated by age group for the different surveillance systems analyzed. Of the 182 ILI patients enrolled by general practitioners, 57.7% tested positive for influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analyses suggested a genetic drift for influenza B and A(H3N2) viruses. The ILI/influenza surveillance systems showed similar trends and were well correlated. In accordance with virological data, the RIRs of having an ILI consultation were highest among the young (<15 years old) and decreased with age. No clusters of acute respiratory illness were declared by the sentinel nursing homes. This study is noteworthy in that it is the first extensive description of the 2012–2013 ILI outbreak in Corsica as monitored through several surveillance systems. To improve ILI surveillance in Corsica, a consortium that links together the complementary regional surveillance ILI systems described here is being implemented.","Minodier, Laëtitia; Arena, Christophe; Heuze, Guillaume; Ruello, Marc; Amoros, Jean Pierre; Souty, Cécile; Varesi, Laurent; Falchi, Alessandra",PLoS One,86,1
2585,2585,2585,TLR4 signaling induces TLR3 up-regulation in alveolar macrophages during acute lung injury,13.474578,8.838304,2017-02-15,"Acute lung injury is a life-threatening inflammatory response caused by severe infection. Toll-like receptors in alveolar macrophages (AMΦ) recognize the molecular constituents of pathogens and activate the host’s innate immune responses. Numerous studies have documented the importance of TLR-TLR cross talk, but few studies have specifically addressed the relationship between TLR4 and TLR3. We explored a novel mechanism of TLR3 up-regulation that is induced by LPS-TLR4 signaling in a dose- and time-dependent manner in AMΦ from C57BL/6 mice, while the LPS-induced TLR3 expression was significantly reduced in TLR4(−/−) and Myd88(−/−) mice and following pretreatment with a NF-κB inhibitor. The enhanced TLR3 up-regulation in AMΦ augmented the expression of cytokines and chemokines in response to sequential challenges with LPS and Poly I:C, a TLR3 ligand, which was physiologically associated with amplified AMΦ-induced PMN migration into lung alveoli. Our study demonstrates that the synergistic effect between TLR4 and TLR3 in macrophages is an important determinant in acute lung injury and, more importantly, that TLR3 up-regulation is dependent on TLR4-MyD88-NF-κB signaling. These results raise the possibility that bacterial infections can induce sensitivity to viral infections, which may have important implications for the therapeutic manipulation of the innate immune system.","Ding, Xibing; Jin, Shuqing; Tong, Yao; Jiang, Xi; Chen, Zhixia; Mei, Shuya; Zhang, Liming; Billiar, Timothy R.; Li, Quan",Sci Rep,86,1
2924,2924,2924,Comparative Diagnostic Performance of the Granulocyte and Neutrophil Counts,13.455378,9.373939,2017-10-04,"OBJECTIVES: Use of point-of-care testing is increasing, however many haematology analysers can only determine granulocyte count without further differentiation into neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils. Since the diagnosis of life-threatening neutropenia in cancer patients requires a distinct neutrophil count, this study aimed to determine the comparative performance between the neutrophil and granulocyte count. DESIGN AND METHODS: A database of 508 646 venous full blood count results measured on a laboratory reference analyser was mined from a large oncology unit. The relationship between granulocyte and neutrophil counts was assessed. Multinomial logistic regression was used to classify results into neutropenia grades using an equivalent granulocyte count. RESULTS: Granulocyte to neutrophil count correlation was 0.997. The accuracy for classification into neutropenia grades using the derived equivalent granulocyte count ranges was 96.4%. Identification of results with a neutrophil count <1.5×10(9) cells/L using an equivalent granulocyte count of <1.69×10(9) cells/L resulted in sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 98.0%, 99.5%, 97.8% and 99.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results describe the relationship between granulocyte and neutrophil counts, measured on a laboratory analyser, in a large population of patients with malignancies and receiving anti-cancer therapies. However, this relationship must be established using a point of care testing system with a three-part differential count before considering the possibility that a granulocyte count can guide clinical decisions in the absence of a definitive neutrophil count, to reduce the frequency and severity of neutropenic complications in patients receiving cancer treatments.","Pether, Nicola S.; Brothwood, Jessica L.; van Berkel, Cornelis; Dunwoodie, Elaine H.; Blake, Robert L.; Price, Christopher P.; Jones, Richard G.; Baker, Karl S.; Hall, Geoff",Pract Lab Med,86,22

Leaf Extract Attenuates Lung Inflammation in Mice with Acute Lung Injury,13.427122,8.756805,2018-02-20,"The hydroalcoholic extract of Punica granatum (pomegranate) leaves was previously demonstrated to be anti-inflammatory in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced acute peritonitis. Here, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of the ethyl acetate fraction obtained from the pomegranate leaf hydroalcoholic extract (EAFPg) on the LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI) mouse model. Male Swiss mice received either EAFPg at different doses or dexamethasone (per os) prior to LPS intranasal instillation. Vehicle-treated mice were used as controls. Animals were culled at 4 h after LPS challenge, and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung samples were collected for analysis. EAFPg and kaempferol effects on NO and cytokine production by LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages were also investigated. Pretreatment with EAFPg (100–300 mg/kg) markedly reduced cell accumulation (specially neutrophils) and collagen deposition in the lungs of ALI mice. The same animals presented with reduced lung and BALF TNF-α and IL-1β expression in comparison with vehicle controls (p < 0.05). Additionally, incubation with either EAFPg or kaempferol (100 μg/ml) reduced NO production and cytokine gene expression in cultured LPS-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Overall, these results demonstrate that the prophylactic treatment with EAFPg attenuates acute lung inflammation. We suggest this fraction may be useful in treating ALI.","Pinheiro, Aruanã Joaquim Matheus Costa Rodrigues; Gonçalves, Jaciara Sá; Dourado, Ádylla Wilenna Alves; de Sousa, Eduardo Martins; Brito, Natilene Mesquita; Silva, Lanna Karinny; Batista, Marisa Cristina Aranha; de Sá, Joicy Cortez; Monteiro, Cinara Regina Aragão Vieira; Fernandes, Elizabeth Soares; Monteiro-Neto, Valério; Campbell, Lee Ann; Zago, Patrícia Maria Wiziack; Lima-Neto, Lidio Gonçalves",J Immunol Res,86,1

The gene expression data set GSE10474 was downloaded and assessed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Principal component analysis, functional enrichment analysis and differential co-expression analysis of DEGs were performed. Furthermore, potential target drugs for key DEGs were assessed. A total of 209 DEGs, including 107 upregulated and 102 downregulated genes were screened. A number of DEGs, including zinc finger and BTB domain containing 17 (ZBTB17), heat shock protein 90 kDa β, member 1 (HSP90B1) and major histocompatibility complex, class II, DR α were identified. Furthermore, gene ontology terms including antigen processing and presentation, glycerophospholipid metabolism, transcriptional misregulation in cancer, thyroid hormone synthesis and pathways associated with diseases, such as asthma were identified. In addition, a differential co-expression network containing ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D4, putative and tubulin, γ complex associated protein 3 was constructed. Furthermore, a number of gene-drug interactions, including between HSP90B1 and adenosine-5′-diphosphate and radicicol, were identified. Therefore, DEGs, including ZBTB17 and HSP90B1, may be important in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced ALI.

3193,3193,3193,Progression of the Radiologic Severity Index predicts mortality in patients with parainfluenza virus-associated lower respiratory infections,13.217431,9.242716,2018-05-17,"BACKGROUND: Radiologic severity may predict adverse outcomes after lower respiratory tract infection (LRI). However, few studies have quantified radiologic severity of LRIs. We sought to evaluate whether a semi-quantitative scoring tool, the Radiologic Severity Index (RSI), predicted mortality after parainfluenza virus (PIV)-associated LRI. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of consecutively-enrolled adult patients with hematologic malignancy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and with PIV detected in nasal wash who subsequently developed radiologically-confirmed LRI. We measured RSI (range 0–72) in each chest radiograph during the first 30 days after LRI diagnosis. We used extended Cox proportional hazards models to identify factors associated with mortality after onset of LRI with all-cause mortality as our failure event. RESULTS: After adjustment for patient characteristics, each 1-point increase in RSI was associated with an increased hazard of death (HR 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.21, p = 0.0008). Baseline RSI was not predictive of death, but both peak RSI and the change from baseline to peak RSI (delta-RSI) predicted mortality (odds ratio for mortality, peak: 1.11 [95%CI 1.04–1.18], delta-RSI: 1.14 [95%CI 1.06–1.22]). A delta-RSI of ≥19.5 was 89% sensitive and 91% specific in predicting 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the RSI offers precise, informative and reliable assessments of LRI severity. Progression of RSI predicts 30-day mortality after LRI, but baseline RSI does not. Our results were derived from a cohort of patients with PIV-associated LRI, but can be applied in validated in other populations of patients with LRI.","Sheshadri, Ajay; Shah, Dimpy P.; Godoy, Myrna; Erasmus, Jeremy J.; Song, Juhee; Li, Liang; Evans, Scott E.; Chemaly, Roy F.; Dickey, Burton F.; Ost, David E.",PLoS One,86,28

Harbin is one of the major cities in northeast China, and more than half of any given year in Harbin is occupied by winter. To reveal the viral etiology and seasonality in adult patients from Harbin, a 4-year consecutive survey was conducted in Harbin, China. Methods: From January 2014 to December 2017, specimens were obtained from adult patients admitted to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University with lower respiratory tract infections. Sputum samples were examined by direct immunofluorescence assays to detect seven common respiratory viruses, including influenza virus (type A and B), parainfluenza virus (type 1 to 3), respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus. Adenovirus positive samples were seeded onto A549 cells to isolate viral strains. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on the highly variable region of adenoviral hexon gene. Results: A total of 1,300 hospitalized adult patients with lower respiratory tract infections were enrolled, in which 189 patients (14.5%) were detected as having at least one viral infection. The co-infection rate in this study was 25.9% (49/189). The dominant viral pathogen from 2014 to 2017 was parainfluenza virus, with a detection rate of 7.2%, followed by influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus. Based on the climate seasons determined by daily average temperature, the highest overall viral detection rate was detected in spring (22.0%, 52/236), followed by winter (13.4%, 109/813), autumn (11.4%, 13/114) and summer (10.9%, 15/137). Adenovirus type 3 strains with slight variations were isolated from positive cases, which were closely related to the GB strain from the United States, as well as the Harbin04B strain isolated locally. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that common respiratory viruses were partially responsible for hospitalized lower respiratory tract infections in adult patients from Harbin, China, with parainfluenza virus as the dominant viral pathogen. Climate seasons could be rational indicators for the seasonality analysis of airborne viral infections. Future surveillance on viral mutations would be necessary to reveal the evolutionary history of respiratory viruses.","Wang, Yingchen; Dong, Tuo; Qi, Guiyun; Qu, Lixin; Liang, Wei; Qi, Binbin; Zhang, Zhe; Shang, Lei; Gao, Hong; Du, Xiqiao; Lu, Bing; Guo, Yan; Liu, Zhenwei; Yu, Huisong; Cui, Qi; Wang, Xiaocen; Li, Ye; Guo, Weiyuan; Qu, Zhangyi",Front Microbiol,86,1

A major limitation that has hindered the use of Treg immunotherapy in humans is the difficulty of consistently isolating and obtaining highly purified Tregs after ex vivo expansion. Methods: We isolated bona fide Tregs from expansion cultures based on their selective surface expression of latency-associated peptide (LAP). The TCR Vβ diversity and intracellular cytokine production of Tregs were determined by flow cytometer. The TSDR methylation was determined by epigenetic human FOXP3 qPCR Assay. Their in vitro and in vivo potency was confirmed with suppression assay and humanized xenogeneic GVHD (xGVHD) murine model, respectively. Results: LAP(+) repurification results in >90% LAP(+)FOXP3(+) Tregs, leaving behind FOXP3(-) and FOXP3(+) nonTregs within the LAP(-) population. After 4-week expansion, the LAP(+) Tregs were >1 billion cells, highly suppressive and anergic in vitro, >90% demethylated in the TSDR and able to maintain TCR Vβ diversity. In the xGVHD model, exogenous CD25(-)PBMC administered alone results in a median survival of 32 days. The co-transfer of LAP(+) Tregs increased median survival to 47 days, while the LAP parent (CD25(+)) and LAP(-) nonTregs had median survival of 39 and 31 days, respectively. Conclusions: These preclinical data together provide evidence that LAP(+) Tregs are highly purified with fully suppressive function for cell therapy. This population results in a more effective and safer product for immunotherapy to treat GVHD and provides the necessary preclinical data for transition into a clinical trial with LAP(+) Tregs to prevent or treat GVHD and other autoimmune diseases.","Wang, Huihui; Song, Hyo; Pham, Anha V.; Cooper, Laurence J.; Schulze, Janika J.; Olek, Sven; Tran, Dat Q.",Theranostics,86,11

Reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced in part by the neutrophil NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2), have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALI. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated the development of pulmonary inflammation in Nox2-deficient (gp91(phox-/y)) mice that was absent in WT mice in a murine model of SIRS. Given this finding, we hypothesized that Nox2 in a resident cell in the lung, specifically the alveolar macrophage, has an essential anti-inflammatory role. Using a murine model of SIRS, we examined whole-lung digests and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALf) from WT and gp91(phox-/y) mice. Both genotypes demonstrated neutrophil sequestration in the lung during SIRS, but neutrophil migration into the alveolar space was only present in the gp91(phox-/y) mice. Macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α gene expression and protein secretion were higher in whole-lung digest from uninjected gp91(phox-/y) mice compared to the WT mice. Gene expression of MIP-1α, MCP-1, and MIP-2 was upregulated in alveolar macrophages obtained from gp91(phox-/y) mice at baseline compared with WT mice. Further, ex vivo analysis of alveolar macrophages, but not bone marrow-derived macrophages or peritoneal macrophages, demonstrated higher gene expression of MIP-1α and MIP-2. Moreover, isolated lung polymorphonuclear neutrophils migrate to BALf obtained from gp91(phox-/y) mice, further providing evidence of a cell-specific anti-inflammatory role for Nox2 in alveolar macrophages. We speculate that Nox2 represses the development of inflammatory lung injury by modulating chemokine expression by the alveolar macrophage.","Potera, Renee M.; Cao, Mou; Jordan, Lin F.; Hogg, Richard T.; Hook, Jessica S.; Moreland, Jessica G.",Inflammation,86,1
4139,4139,4139,Pharmacotherapy of Lower Respiratory Tract Infections in Elderly—Focused on Antibiotics,13.593587,9.142628,2019-10-31,"Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) refer to the inflammation of the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and lung tissue. Old people have an increased risk of developing LRTIs compared to young adults. The prevalence of LRTIs in the elderly population is not only related to underlying diseases and aging itself, but also to a variety of clinical issues, such as history of hospitalization, previous antibacterial therapy, mechanical ventilation, antibiotic resistance. These factors mentioned above have led to an increase in the prevalence and mortality of LRTIs in the elderly, and new medical strategies targeting LRTIs in this population are urgently needed. After a systematic review of the current randomized controlled trials and related studies, we recommend novel pharmacotherapies that demonstrate advantages for the management of LRTIs in people over the age of 65. We also briefly reviewed current medications for respiratory communicable diseases in the elderly. Various sources of information were used to ensure all relevant studies were included. We searched Pubmed, MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), and ClinicalTrials.gov. Strengths and limitations of these drugs were evaluated based on whether they have novelty of mechanism, favorable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles, avoidance of interactions and intolerance, simplicity of dosing, and their ability to cope with challenges which was mainly evaluated by the primary and secondary endpoints. The purpose of this review is to recommend the most promising antibiotics for treatment of LRTIs in the elderly (both in hospital and in the outpatient setting) based on the existing results of clinical studies with the novel antibiotics, and to briefly review current medications for respiratory communicable diseases in the elderly, aiming to a better management of LRTIs in clinical practice.","Liu, Yang; Zhang, Yan; Zhao, Wanyu; Liu, Xiaolei; Hu, Fengjuan; Dong, Birong",Front Pharmacol,86,1
4335,4335,4335,Molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance features of Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates from Pakistan,13.724155,9.158491,2020-01-15,"BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen with a notorious reputation of being resistant to antimicrobial agents. The capability of A. baumannii to persist and disseminate between healthcare settings has raised a major concern worldwide. METHODS: Our study investigated the antibiotic resistance features and molecular epidemiology of 52 clinical isolates of A. baumannii collected in Pakistan between 2013 and 2015. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined by the agar disc diffusion method. Comparative sequence analyses of the ampC and bla(OXA-51-like) alleles were used to assign the isolates into clusters. The whole genomes of 25 representative isolates were sequenced using the MiSeq Desktop Sequencer. Free online applications were used to determine the phylogeny of genomic sequences, retrieve the multilocus sequence types (ST), and detect acquired antimicrobial resistance genes. RESULTS: Overall, the isolates were grouped into 7 clusters and 3 sporadic isolates. The largest cluster, Ab-Pak-cluster-1 (bla(OXA-66) and ISAba1-ampC-19) included 24 isolates, belonged to ST2 and International clone (IC) II, and was distributed between two geographical far-off cities, Lahore and Peshawar. Ab-Pak-clusters-2 (bla(OXA-66), ISAba1-ampC-2), and -3 (bla(OXA-66), ISAba1-ampC-20) and the individual isolate Ab-Pak-Lah-01 (ISAba1-bla(OXA-66), ISAba1-ampC-2) were also assigned to ST2 and IC II. On the other hand, Ab-Pak-clusters-4 (bla(OXA-69), ampC-1), -5 (bla(OXA-69), ISAba1-ampC-78), and -6A (bla(OXA-371), ISAba1-ampC-3) belonged to ST1, while Ab-Pak-cluster-6B (bla(OXA-371), ISAba1-ampC-8) belonged to ST1106, with both ST1 and ST1106 being members of IC I. Five isolates belonged to Ab-Pak-cluster-7 (bla(OXA-65), ampC-43). This cluster corresponded to ST158, showed a well-delineated position on the genomic phylogenetic tree, and was equipped with several antimicrobial resistance genes including bla(OXA-23) and bla(GES-11). CONCLUSIONS: Our study detected the occurrence of 7 clusters of A. baumannii in Pakistan. Altogether, 6/7 of the clusters and 45/52 (86.5%) of the isolates belonged to IC I (n = 9) or II (n = 36), making Pakistan no exception to the global domination of these two clones. The onset of ST158 in Pakistan marked a geographical dispersal of this clone beyond the Middle East and brought up the need for a detailed characterization.","Karah, Nabil; Khalid, Fizza; Wai, Sun Nyunt; Uhlin, Bernt Eric; Ahmad, Irfan",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,86,1

Whereas many viruses show high mutation rates enabling them to develop escape mutants, mutations of their cellular virus receptors are far less likely. We report on antiviral efficacies of CAR gene silencing by short hairpin (sh)RNAs in the cardiac-derived HL-1 cell line and in primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (PNCMs). Treatment with shRNA vectors mediating RNA interference against the CAR resulted in almost complete silencing of receptor expression both in HL-1 cells and PNCMs. Whereas CAR was silenced in HL-1 cells as early as 24 h after vector treatment, its downregulation in PNCMs did not become significant before day 6. CAR knockout resulted in inhibition of CoxB3 infections by up to 97% in HL-1 cells and up to 90% in PNCMs. Adenovirus was inhibited by only 75% in HL-1 cells, but up to 92% in PNCMs. We conclude that CAR knockout by shRNA vectors is efficient against CoxB3 and adenovirus in primary cardiac cells, but the efficacy of this approach in vivo may be influenced by cell type-specific silencing kinetics in different tissues.","Fechner, H; Pinkert, S; Wang, X; Sipo, I; Suckau, L; Kurreck, J; Dörner, A; Sollerbrant, K; Zeichhardt, H; Grunert, H-P; Vetter, R; Schultheiss, H-P; Poller, W",Gene Ther,86,17

METHODS: An enzyme inhibition assay against HpCGS was carried out by using a continuous coupled spectrophotometric assay approach. The inhibition assay of HpFabD was performed based on the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase-coupled system, while the inhibition assay for HpFabZ was monitored by detecting the decrease in absorbance at 260 nm with crotonoyl-CoA conversion to β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. The juglone/FabZ complex crystal was obtained by soaking juglone into the HpFabZ crystal, and the X-ray crystal structure of the complex was analyzed by molecular replacement approach. RESULTS: Juglone was shown to potently inhibit HpCGS, HpFabD, and HpFabZ with the half maximal inhibitory concentration IC(50) values of 7.0±0.7, 20±1, and 30±4 μmol/L, respectively. An inhibition-type study indicated that juglone was a non-competitive inhibitor of HpCGS against O-succinyl-L-homoserine (K(i)=αK(i)=24 μmol/L), an uncompetitive inhibitor of HpFabD against malonyl-CoA (αK(i)=7.4 μmol/L), and a competitive inhibitor of HpFabZ against crotonoyl-CoA (K(i)=6.8 μmol/L). Moreover, the crystal structure of the HpFabZ/juglone complex further revealed the essential binding pattern of juglone against HpFabZ at the atomic level. CONCLUSION: HpCGS, HpFabD, and HpFabZ are potential targets of juglone.","Kong, Yun-hua; Zhang, Liang; Yang, Zheng-yi; Han, Cong; Hu, Li-hong; Jiang, Hua-liang; Shen, Xu",Acta Pharmacol Sin,86,1

Thus, it is paramount to develop novel strategies to alleviate death rates. Here we show that avian influenza A H5N1-infected patients exhibit markedly increased serum levels of angiotensin II. High serum levels of angiotensin II appear to be linked to the severity and lethality of infection, at least in some patients. In experimental mouse models, infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 virus results in downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression in the lung and increased serum angiotensin II levels. Genetic inactivation of ACE2 causes severe lung injury in H5N1-challenged mice, confirming a role of ACE2 in H5N1-induced lung pathologies. Administration of recombinant human ACE2 ameliorates avian influenza H5N1 virus-induced lung injury in mice. Our data link H5N1 virus-induced acute lung failure to ACE2 and provide a potential treatment strategy to address future flu pandemics.

Concerns have been raised about the safety of intra-vascular adenovirus administration following a patient death on a clinical trial with a replication-defective adenovirus. In addition, the feasibility of vascular delivery to distant tumors has been questioned. dl1520 (ONYX-015) is a replication-selective adenovirus that has previously shown safety and antitumoral activity following intratumoral injection. This is the first report of intra-vascular administration with a genetically engineered, replication-selective virus. A phase I dose-escalation trial was performed in patients with liver-predominant gastrointestinal carcinoma (n = 11 total; primarily colorectal). dl1520 was infused into the hepatic artery at doses of 2 × 10(8)–2 × 10(12) particles for two cycles (days 1 and 8). Subsequent cycles of dl1520 were administered in combination with intravenous 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin. No dose-limiting toxicity, maximally tolerated dose or treatment-emergent clinical hepatotoxicity were identified following dl1520 infusion. Mild to moderate fever, rigors and fatigue were the most common adverse events. Antibody titers increased significantly in all patients. Viral replication was detectable in patients receiving the highest two doses. An objective response was demonstrated in combination with chemotherapy in a patient who was refractory to both 5-FU and dl1520 as single agents. Therefore, hepatic artery infusion of the attenuated adenovirus dl1520 was well-tolerated at doses resulting in infection, replication and chemotherapy-associated antitumoral activity.","Reid, T; Galanis, E; Abbruzzese, J; Sze, D; Andrews, J; Romel, L; Hatfield, M; Rubin, J; Kirn, D",Gene Ther,86,1

ALI was induced in female BALB/c mice by the intranasal administration of 0.1 mg/kg LPS. The mice were divided into a group receiving normal feed and another group receiving feed mixed with TJ-41 at a dose of 1 g/kg/day for 8 weeks before LPS challenge. In the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, the preadministration of TJ-41 caused significant reduction in the absolute number of total cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. The preadministration of TJ-41 significantly inhibited increases in the serum level of keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), which is a murine chemotaxin for neutrophils that corresponds to human interleukin-8, with respect to its concentration at 24 h after LPS challenge. Furthermore, the histopathologic findings indicated that alveolitis with leukocyte infiltration in the alveolar space was less severe in the TJ-41-treated mice than in the control mice. These findings indicated that the preadministration of TJ-41 could show an inhibitory effect on ALI in this experimental murine system associated with the suppression of chemokine production.","Tajima, Shunji; Bando, Masashi; Yamasawa, Hideaki; Ohno, Shoji; Moriyama, Hiroshi; Takada, Toshinori; Suzuki, Eiichi; Gejyo, Fumitake; Sugiyama, Yukihiko",Lung,86,1

Plasmodium falciparum causes the most common and most dangerous form of malaria, called malignant tertian malaria or falciparum malaria. METHOD: Search and evaluation of the current literature. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Over 90 % of all malaria cases and malaria deaths occur in Africa, while the remaining cases are divided between India, Southeast Asia, Oceania, and Latin America. In Germany, between 513 and 613 cases of malaria have been reportet annually over the last 10 years according to the Robert Koch Institute, including 389–541 cases of potentially fatal falciparum malaria (Plasmodium falciparum). All fever patients who have been in to the tropics during the last 4 months must be tested for malaria. However, immigrants from tropical regions might develop malaria even years after their last trip to their former home country. Rapid diagnostic tests are now available—particularly for falciparum malaria. However, the occasional negative or false-positive results are possible. The treatment of malaria depends on the Plasmodium species, the clinical severity, and the region in which the infection was acquired.","Hemmer, C. J.; Loebermann, M.; Reisinger, E.

Systemic activation of the inflammatory system after aortic injury may play a role in the development of LOI. The aim of this study is to clarify the effect of beta-blockers on systemic inflammation and the development of LOI after distal type AAD. A total of 49 patients, who were admitted with distal type AAD and treated conservatively, were examined. White blood cell (WBC) count, serum CRP level, and arterial blood gases were measured serially. Forty patients received beta-blocker treatment within 24 h of the onset, while 9 patients received no beta-blocker treatment. Maximum WBC count, maximum CRP level, lowest PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F) ratio, and patient background were compared between the two groups. There was no difference between the groups according to age, sex, coronary risk factors, blood pressure, serum level of CRP, WBC count, and oxygenation index on admission. Beta-blocker treatment was associated with lower maximum WBC count (P = 0.0028) and lower maximum serum CRP level (P = 0.0004). The minimum P/F ratio was higher in patients with beta-blocker treatment than in those without (P = 0.0076). Multivariate analysis revealed that administration of a beta-blocker was an independent negative determinant of LOI (P/F ratio ≤200 mmHg). In conclusion, early use of beta-blockers prevented excessive inflammation and LOI after distal type AAD, suggesting a pleiotropic effect of beta-blockers on the inflammatory response after AAD.","Jo, Yusuke; Anzai, Toshihisa; Sugano, Yasuo; Naito, Kotaro; Ueno, Koji; Kohno, Takashi; Yoshikawa, Tsutomu; Ogawa, Satoshi",Heart Vessels,86,1

Unfortunately, its promising use as an anticancer agent was biased by its toxicity, which was clear soon from the first clinical trials with TNF in cancer. Almost at the same time TNF was being developed as an anticancer drug, it became clear that TNF was identical to a mediator responsible for cachexia associated with sepsis, which was termed cachectin. This research led to the finding that TNF is, in fact, the main lethal mediator of sepsis and to the publication of a huge number of articles showing that TNF inhibits the toxic effects of bacterial endotoxins, which are now described as systemic inflammatory response. Although the clinical trials with anti-TNF in sepsis have not been successful thus far, undoubtedly as a result of the complexity of this clinical setting, these studies ultimately led to the identification of TNF as a key inflammatory mediator and to the development of anti-TNF molecules (soluble receptors and antibodies) for important diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease. On the other side, the mechanisms by which TNF and related molecules induce cell death have been studied in depth, and their knowledge might, in the future, suggest means of improve the therapeutic index of TNF in cancer.","Ghezzi, Pietro; Cerami, Anthony",Mol Biotechnol,86,28

We have found that adenoviral gene transfer of SOCS-1 ameliorates smoke inhalation-induced lung injury in C57BL/6 mice. We also found that the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was increased post smoke exposure, while oxidized ATP, an inhibitor of purinergic P2X7 receptor, suppressed smoke-induced NALP3 inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation, and K(+) efflux. Similar to oxidized ATP, high protein level of SOCS-1 dampened the formation of NALP3 inflammasome and the activation of caspase-1 and IL-1β induced by smoke exposure in mouse alveolar macrophages. In conclusion, SOCS-1 relieves smoke inhalation-induced pulmonary inflammation and injury by inhibiting NALP3 inflammasome formation.","Zhang, Leifang; Xu, Chenming; Chen, Xiaoming; Shi, Qiwen; Su, Weike; Zhao, Hang",Inflammation,86,1

In our cohort, anemia due to pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) occurred in 15/22 (68%) of cases, being the most common indication for treatment. Neutropenia was only found in 8/22 (36%) cases, and recurrent infections, the most important clinical problem in Western patients, were not observed. None of our cases presented with rheumatoid arthritis. These clinical features were consistently observed when compared with the 88 other Asian patients. Combined data from our cohort and other Asian cases showed that Asian patients, compared with Western patients, had more frequent anemia (66/110, 60% versus 113/240, 47%; p = 0.044), attributable to a much higher incidence of PRCA (52/110, 47% versus 6/143, 4%; p < 0.001).

It is important to detect mutations in viral genes and analyze the clinical features of patients and viral shedding duration related to neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) resistance. We collected clinical specimens from 31 hospitalized H7N9 patients and sequenced NA, PB2, HA, and M gene fragments. Of the 31 identified patients, 7 (22.6%) carried the R292K substitution in NA, 30 (96.8%), 3 (9.7%), and 5 (16.1%) carried E627K, Q591K, and D701N mutations in PB2, respectively, and 2 (6.5%) carried both E627K and D701N mutations in PB2. All 26 identified patients harbored Q226L mutations and possessed only a single arginine (R) at cleavage sites in the HA and a S31N mutation in M2. Among 7 NA-R292K mutated patients, 3 died and 4 were discharged. There was no significant difference in the days that patients started oseltamivir treatment after symptom onset between NA-R292K mutant and NA-R292 wild-type patients (median days, 7 vs 6, P = 0.374). NA-R292K mutant patients had a significantly longer duration of viral shedding than NA-R292 wild-type patients after oseltamivir treatment (median days, 10 vs 5, P = 0.022).

The aim of this review is to describe the increasing evidence that inflammation plays a critical role in the early stages of CLD of the neonate. Ongoing lung damage in the premature infant may be caused by failure to downregulate and control this inflammatory response. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 are important pro-inflammatory cytokines of which IL-8 is an important chemotactic factor in the lung. Data suggest that preterm newborns with lung inflammation may be unable to activate the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Therefore, early post-natal anti-inflammatory therapy could help in preventing development of CLD. Prophylactic dexamethasone therapy cannot yet be recommended. There are a number of potential interactions between surfactant and cytokine effects on the preterm lung which have not been evaluated. Surfactant protein A may be an important modulator of the immune response to lung injury. The role of high-frequency ventilation in the prevention of CLD still remains unclear. Conclusion Many aspects of the pathogenesis of the inflammatory response in the development of chronic lung disease remain to be elucidated.

However, the phenotypic impact of genetic variants often remained unclear, thus the rationale of their use in risk prediction may be limited. We therefore analyzed genetic variants together with anthropometric and lifestyle factors to see how these affect mRNA levels of ERCC1 , MDM2 and TP53 in primary blood lymphocytes. mRNA expression was measured in 376 prostate cancer patients by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription, and ERCC1 rs11615 T>C, ERCC1 rs3212986 C>A, MDM2 rs2279744 T>G and TP53 rs17878362 (p53PIN3) polymorphisms were determined. Considerable interindividual differences in mRNA expression were found (coefficients of variation: ERCC1 , 45%; MDM2 , 43% and TP53 , 35%). ERCC1 expression was positively correlated with plasma levels of β-carotene ( P = 0.03) and negatively correlated with canthaxanthin ( P = 0.02) and lutein ( P = 0.02). Overall, the polymorphisms affected mRNA expression only weakly. Carriers of a distinct ERCC1 haplotype (CC) showed, however, significantly lower expression values than non-carriers ( P = 0.001). Applying logistic regression, we found that CC haplotype carriers had a 1.69-fold increased odds ratio (95% confidence interval: 1.06–2.71) for reduced ERCC1 mRNA levels. This low ERCC1 expression might be associated with reduced DNA repair and better therapy response. In summary, the association we have found between ERCC1 genotype and mRNA expression supports recent clinical observations that genetic variation in ERCC1 can affect treatment outcome and prognosis. Our study further revealed a modulating effect by nutritional factors.","Woelfelschneider, Andreas; Popanda, Odilia; Lilla, Carmen; Linseisen, Jakob; Mayer, Claudia; Celebi, Oktay; Debus, Jürgen; Bartsch, Helmut; Chang-Claude, Jenny; Schmezer, Peter",Carcinogenesis,86,1

It is projected as a potential tool to inhibit viral replication. In the present paper, we demonstrate the suppression of replication of an avian herpes virus (Anatid Herpes Virus-1, AHV-1) by siRNA mediated gene silencing in avian cells. The UL-6 gene of AHV-1 that codes for a protein involved in viral packaging was targeted. Both cocktail and unique siRNAs were attempted to evaluate the inhibitory potential of AHV-1 replication in duck embryo fibroblast (DEF) cell line. DEF cells were chemically transfected with different siRNAs in separate experiments followed by viral infection. The observed reduction in virus replication was evaluated by cytopathic effect, viral titration and quantitative real time PCR (QRT-PCR). Among the three siRNA targets used the unique siRNA UL-B sequence was found to be more potent in antiviral activity than the cocktail and UL6-A-siRNA sequences.","Mallanna, Sunil Kumar; Rasool, T.J.; Sahay, Bikash; Aleyas, Abi George; Ram, Hira; Mondal, Bimalendu; Nautiyal, Binita; Premraj, Avinash; Sreekumar, E.; Yadav, M.P.",Virus Res,86,1

Quantification of evapotranspiration from terrestrial landforms of the delta, fringed by riparian woodlands, is one of the main contributors to uncertainty in current hydrological modelling. We investigated sap flow of common trees in the distal, mid‐ and upper delta in July–August 2012, November–December 2012 and February–April 2013 using the compensation heat pulse velocity method. In the distal delta, four Diospyros mespiliformis individuals of different sizes were studied. Four trees of different species were studied in the mid‐ and upper delta. Sap flow density (SFD; flow per unit cross‐sectional area) was used as a common unit to facilitate comparison. Sap flow varied with tree size, species, season and location. It was positively correlated with tree size (r (2) = 0.67). Sap flow variation between seasons and across locations in all the species studied indicated two distinct groups. Group 1 transpired the least during the hottest season, November–December, and Group 2 the most. In Group 1, the highest average SFD was 1.17 l cm(−2 )day(−1) during July–August; in Group 2, it was 1.07 l cm(−2) day(−1) during November–December.

This study presents maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS), and the chloroplast DNA trnL intron, trnL‐trnF intergenic spacer region, and trnE‐trnT intergenic spacer region sequences. The ITS and cpDNA data sets strongly support the monophyly of a Beslerieae/Napeantheae clade; an Episcieae clade; a Gesnerieae clade; a Gloxinieae clade minus Sinningia, Sinningia relatives, and Gloxinia sarmentiana; and a Sinningia/Paliavana/Vanhouttea clade. This is the first study to provide strong statistical support for these tribes/clades. These analyses suggest that Sinningia and relatives should be considered as a separate tribe. Additionally, generic relationships are explored, including the apparent polyphyly of Gloxinia. Chromosome number changes are minimized on the proposed phylogeny, with the exception of the n = 11 taxa of the Gloxinieae. Scaly rhizomes appear to have been derived once in the Gloxinieae sensu stricto.

The aim of this study was to develop a real‐time nucleic acid sequenced based amplification (NASBA) using a molecular beacon that could detect a wide range of influenza A subtypes and strains in a single reaction by targeting a conserved region of the influenza genome, and to evaluate its sensitivity and specificity against traditional laboratory techniques on a range of clinical samples usefulness during the 2003/2004 influenza season. The results demonstrated the assay to be highly sensitive and specific, detecting <0.1 TCID(50) of virus stock. Three hundred eighty‐nine clinical samples were tested in total from two patient groups. Overall, the real‐time NASBA assay detected 64% (66/103) more influenza positive samples than cell culture and direct immunofluorescence (IF) and, therefore, was shown to be more sensitive in detecting influenza A in a wide range of respiratory samples than traditional methods.

The management of perioperative antibiotic therapy is a major issue, but little is known about worldwide practices. METHODS: We sent by email a survey dealing with 5 daily clinical vignettes concerning perioperative antibiotic therapy to 180 LTx centers around the world. The invitation and a weekly reminder were sent to lung transplant specialists for a single consensus answer per center during a 3-month period. RESULTS: We received a total of 99 responses from 24 countries, mostly from Western Europe (n = 46) and the USA (n = 34). Systematic screening for bronchial recipient colonization before LTx was mostly performed with sputum samples (72%), regardless of the underlying lung disease. In recipients without colonization, antibiotics with activity against gram-negative bacteria resistant strains (piperacillin / tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, carbapenems) were reported in 72% of the centers, and antibiotics with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (mainly vancomycin) were reported in 38% of the centers. For these recipients, the duration of antibiotics reported was 7 days (33%) or less (26%) or stopped when cultures of donor and recipients were reported negatives (12%). In recipients with previous colonization, antibiotics were adapted to the susceptibility of the most resistant strain and given for at least 14 days (67%). CONCLUSION: Practices vary widely around the world, but resistant bacterial strains are mostly targeted even if no colonization occurs. The antibiotic duration reported was longer for colonized recipients.","Coiffard, Benjamin; Prud’Homme, Eloi; Hraiech, Sami; Cassir, Nadim; Le Pavec, Jérôme; Kessler, Romain; Meloni, Federica; Leone, Marc; Thomas, Pascal Alexandre; Reynaud-Gaubert, Martine; Papazian, Laurent",BMC Pulm Med,86,9

Its deficiency is classified as a primary immunodeficiency associated to pyogenic bacterial infections, inflammatory lung disease, and autoimmunity. In Europeans, MASP-2 deficiency, due to homozygosity for c.359A > G (p.D120G), occurs in 7 to 14/10,000 individuals. We analyzed the presence of the p.D120G mutation in adults (increasing the sample size of our previous studies) and children. Different groups of patients (1495 adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, 186 adults with systemic lupus erythematosus, 103 pediatric patients with invasive pneumococcal disease) and control individuals (1119 healthy adult volunteers, 520 adult patients without history of relevant infectious diseases, and a pediatric control group of 311 individuals) were studied. Besides our previously reported MASP-2-deficient healthy adults, we found a new p.D120G homozygous individual from the pediatric control group. We also reviewed p.D120G homozygous individuals reported so far: a total of eleven patients with a highly heterogeneous range of disorders and nine healthy controls (including our four MASP-2-deficient individuals) have been identified by chance in association studies. Individuals with complete deficiencies of several pattern recognition molecules of the lectin pathway (MBL, collectin-10 and collectin-11, and ficolin-3) as well as of MASP-1 and MASP-3 have also been reviewed. Cumulative evidence suggests that MASP-2, and even other components of the LP, are largely redundant in human defenses and that individuals with MASP-2 deficiency do not seem to be particularly prone to infectious or autoimmune diseases.","García-Laorden, M.

This study investigated the extent of pharmacist supply of oseltamivir over 5 years, including during the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, and the impact of pharmacist supply of oseltamivir on influenza virus oseltamivir susceptibility, personal stockpiling and influenza vaccine uptake. METHODS: Randomly selected community pharmacies in NZ reported oseltamivir provision by prescription and through pharmacist supply from 1 January 2007 to 15 September 2011. Oseltamivir resistance data on influenza viruses isolated during influenza surveillance from 2008 to 2011 were obtained, along with influenza vaccine uptake data from 2005 to 2011 and influenza detection data. RESULTS: Seventy of 85 eligible pharmacies completed the study (82% response rate). Most supplies of oseltamivir throughout the 5 years were dispensed against a prescription rather than pharmacist supplied, with pharmacist supply responsible for 11% of supplies during the pandemic years (2009–10) versus 27% and 31% during 2007 and 2008, respectively. Pharmacist-supplied oseltamivir did not appear to be associated with the development of resistance, with identified likely stockpiling or with a decline in influenza immunization. Pharmacist supplies largely matched the timing of influenza in the community and peaked in June 2009, as did prescription supplies. CONCLUSIONS: Five years of non-prescription oseltamivir in NZ has resulted in no significant change in the development of resistance or rates of influenza immunization. Supplies remained modest and significant consumer stockpiling through pharmacist supply has not occurred, even during the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic in 2009 and 2010.

There is only limited guidance for clinicians managing non-malarial fevers, which often results in inappropriate treatment for patients. Furthermore, there is little evidence for estimates of disease burden, or to guide empirical therapy, control measures, resource allocation, prioritisation of clinical diagnostics or antimicrobial stewardship. The Febrile Illness Evaluation in a Broad Range of Endemicities (FIEBRE) study seeks to address these information gaps. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: FIEBRE investigates febrile illness in paediatric and adult outpatients and inpatients using standardised clinical, laboratory and social science protocols over a minimum 12-month period at five sites in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeastern and Southern Asia. Patients presenting with fever are enrolled and provide clinical data, pharyngeal swabs and a venous blood sample; selected participants also provide a urine sample. Laboratory assessments target infections that are treatable and/or preventable. Selected point-of-care tests, as well as blood and urine cultures and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, are performed on site. On day 28, patients provide a second venous blood sample for serology and information on clinical outcome. Further diagnostic assays are performed at international reference laboratories. Blood and pharyngeal samples from matched community controls enable calculation of AFs, and surveys of treatment seeking allow estimation of the incidence of common infections. Additional assays detect markers that may differentiate bacterial from non-bacterial causes of illness and/or prognosticate illness severity. Social science research on antimicrobial use will inform future recommendations for fever case management. Residual samples from participants are stored for future use. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from all relevant institutional and national committees; written informed consent is obtained from all participants or parents/guardians. Final results will be shared with participating communities, and in open-access journals and other scientific fora.

METHODS: Two review authors independently searched all randomized clinical trials from international databases, including Medline (PubMed), Web of Sciences, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Research Registers of ongoing trials (ClinicalTrials.gov), from January 1989 to August 2017. Two independent review authors were responsible for data collection. After extracting the necessary information from the evaluated articles, metaanalysis of the data was performed using Stata version 14. Also, sources of heterogeneity among studies were determined by Meta regression. RESULTS: In this study, among 126 articles that were extracted from primary studies, 7 papers that evaluated the effect of MgSO(4) on IVH were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis.

We showed that the fecal bacteria from KNGT successfully colonized in the intestinal tract of db/db mice detected on day 14. In the FMT-treated db/db mice, the levels of fasting blood glucose, postprandial glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein–cholesterol were significantly downregulated, whereas high-density lipoprotein–cholesterol levels were upregulated. In the FMT-treated db/db mice, Desulfovibrio and Clostridium coccoides levels in gut were significantly decreased, but the fecal levels of Akkermansia muciniphila and colon histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC3) protein expression were increased. At 8 weeks, both intestinal target bacteria and HDAC3 were correlated with glycolipid levels; Akkermansia muciniphila level was positively correlated with HDAC3 protein expression (r = +0.620, P = 0.037).

Parkin can function as a neuroprotector that plays a crucial role in the regulation of mitophagy, and germline mutations in PARK2 are associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Intriguingly, recent studies suggest that Parkin can also function as a tumor suppressor and that somatic and germline mutations in PARK2 are associated with various human cancers, including lung cancer. However, it is presently unknown how the tumor suppressor activity of Parkin is affected by these mutations and whether it is associated with mitophagy. Herein, we show that wild-type (WT) Parkin can rapidly translocate onto mitochondria following mitochondrial damage and that Parkin promotes mitophagic clearance of mitochondria in lung cancer cells. However, lung cancer-linked mutations inhibit the mitochondrial translocation and ubiquitin-associated activity of Parkin. Among all lung cancer-linked mutants that we tested, A46T Parkin failed to translocate onto mitochondria and could not recruit downstream mitophagic regulators, including optineurin (OPTN) and TFEB, whereas N254S and R275W Parkin displayed slower mitochondrial translocation than WT Parkin. Moreover, we found that deferiprone (DFP), an iron chelator that can induce mitophagy, greatly increased the death of A46T Parkin-expressing lung cancer cells. Taken together, our results reveal a novel mitophagic mechanism in lung cancer, suggesting that lung cancer-linked mutations in PARK2 are associated with impaired mitophagy and identifying DFP as a novel therapeutic agent for PARK2-linked lung cancer and possibly other types of cancers driven by mitophagic dysregulation.","Zhang, Zeng-li; Wang, Na-na; Ma, Qi-lian; Chen, Yang; Yao, Li; Zhang, Li; Li, Qiu-shi; Shi, Min-hua; Wang, Hong-feng; Ying, Zheng",Acta Pharmacol Sin,86,17

This inhibition, however, may induce mutations in the targeted gene, leading to rapid escape from the shRNA-induced inhibition. We generated a lymphoid cell line that stably expressed a 19-bp shRNA targeting a well-conserved dimerization initiation site (DIS) of HIV-1, which strongly inhibited viral replication, thereby delaying virus escape. Furthermore, treatment of HIV-1 infection with DIS- and vif-shRNA combination therapy resulted in superior anti-viral responses compared to vif-shRNA monotherapy.

However, little is known about the composition and development of the vaginal microbiota during pregnancy and birth. Here, we analyzed the vaginal microbiota of 57 women in pregnancy week 24, 36 and at birth after rupture of membranes but before delivery, and further compared the composition with that of the gut and airways of the 1-week-old child. The vaginal community structure had dramatic changes in bacterial diversity and taxonomic distribution, yet carried an individual-specific signature. The relative abundance of most bacterial taxa increased stepwise from week 24 of pregnancy until birth, with a gradual decline of Lactobacillus. Mother-to-child vertical transfer, as suggested by sharing, was modest, with the strongest transfer being for Clostridiales followed by Lactobacillales and Enterobacteriales. In conclusion, late gestation is associated with an increase in maternal vaginal microbiota diversity, and vaginal bacteria at birth only modestly predict the composition of the neonatal microbiota.","Rasmussen, M.

However, to date, no study can diagnose suicide ideation/behavior among university students in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region using a machine learning approach. Therefore, stability feature selection and stacked ensembled decision trees were employed in this classification problem. A total of 573 university students responded to a battery of questionnaires. Three-fold cross-validation with a variety of performance indices was sued. The proposed diagnostic system had excellent balanced diagnosis accuracy (AUC = 0.90 [CI 95%: 0.86–0.93]) with a high correlation between predicted and observed class labels, fair discriminant power, and excellent class labeling agreement rate. Results showed that 23 items out of all items could accurately diagnose suicide ideation/behavior. These items were psychological problems and how to experience trauma, from the demographic variables, nine items from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5), two items from Post Traumatic Growth (PTG), two items from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), six items from the Positive Mental Health (PMH) questionnaire, and one item related to social support.

The aim of this study is to design and apply a composed and stage-approach therapy combining antibiotherapy, surgical treatment, and photo-biomodulation (PBM) for the prevention or treatment of MRONJ lesions. Materials and Methods: The proposed treatment protocol was carried out in the Department of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery of the “Victor Babes” University of Medicine and Farmacy of Timisoara, in 2018–2020. A total of 241 patients who were previously exposed to antiresorptive or anti-angiogenic therapy, as well as patients already diagnosed with MRONJ at different stages of the disease were treated. A preventive protocol was applied for patients in an “at risk” stage. Patients in more advanced stages received a complex treatment. Results: The healing proved to be complete, with spontaneous bone coverage in all the n = 84 cases placed in an “at risk” stage. For the n = 49 patients belonging to stage 0, pain reductions and decreases of mucosal inflammations were also obtained in all cases. For the n = 108 patients proposed for surgery (i.e., in stages 1, 2, or 3 of MRONJ), a total healing rate of 91.66% was obtained after the first surgery, while considering the downscaling to stage 1 as a treatment “success”, only one “failure” was reported. This brings the overall “success” rate to 96.68% for a complete healing, and to 99.59% when downscaling to stage 1 is included in the healing rate. Conclusions: Therefore, the clinical outcome of the present study indicates that patients with MRONJ in almost all stages of the disease can benefit from such a proposed association of methods, with superior clinical results compared to classical therapies.","Nica, Diana Florina; Riviș, Mircea; Roi, Ciprian Ioan; Todea, Carmen Darinca; Duma, Virgil-Florin; Sinescu, Cosmin",Medicina (Kaunas),86,22

In recent years, the PAC evolved from a device that enabled intermittent cardiac output measurements in combination with static pressures to a monitoring tool that provides continuous data on cardiac output, oxygen supply and-demand balance, as well as right ventricular performance. In this review, which consists of two parts, we will introduce the difference between intermittent pulmonary artery thermodilution using bolus injections, and the contemporary PAC enabling continuous measurements by using a thermal filament which heats up the blood. In this second part, we will discuss in detail the measurements of the contemporary PAC, including continuous cardiac output measurement, right ventricular ejection fraction, end-diastolic volume index, and mixed venous oxygen saturation. Limitations of all of these measurements are highlighted as well. We conclude that thorough understanding of measurements obtained from the PAC is the first step in successful application of the PAC in daily clinical practice.

However, the predictive role of TIM-3 in cancer remains largely undetermined. This study was designed to investigate the role of TIM-3 in cancer. METHODS: Publications were searched using multiple databases. The hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. To further confirm the prognostic effect of TIM-3, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data were applied. Functional analysis of TIM-3 was also investigated. RESULTS: 28 studies with 7284 patients with malignant tumors were identified. Based on multivariate Cox regression analysis, TIM-3 was an independent prognostic indicator for poor overall survival (OS) (HR= 1.54, 95% CI = 1.19-1.98, P = 0.001). However, TIM-3 was not correlated with cancer-specific survival and disease-free survival (DFS). Particularly, TIM-3 showed a worse prognosis in non-small cell lung carcinoma and gastric cancer; but it showed a favorable prognosis in breast cancer. Functional analysis showed that TIM-3 was closely correlated with immune responses such as T-cell activation and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Moreover, TIM-3 expression was found to be related to worse OS in 9491 TCGA patients (HR = 1.2, P < 0.001), but was not associated with DFS. CONCLUSIONS: TIM-3 was an independent prognostic factor. Meanwhile, TIM-3 played a crucial role in tumor immune responses. This supports TIM-3 as a promising target for cancer immunotherapy.","Zang, Kui; Hui, Liangliang; Wang, Min; Huang, Ying; Zhu, Xingxing; Yao, Bin",Front Oncol,86,1

In this condition, passive leg raising (PLR) could be used, but it requires a measurement of cardiac output. The tidal volume (Vt) challenge (PPV changes induced by a 1-min increase in Vt from 6 to 8 mL/kg) is another alternative, but it requires an arterial line. We tested whether, in case of Vt = 6 mL/kg, the effects of PLR could be assessed through changes in PPV (ΔPPV(PLR)) or in IVCDV (ΔIVCDV(PLR)) rather than changes in cardiac output, and whether the effects of the Vt challenge could be assessed by changes in IVCDV (ΔIVCDV(Vt)) rather than changes in PPV (ΔPPV(Vt)). METHODS: In 30 critically ill patients without spontaneous breathing and cardiac arrhythmias, ventilated with Vt = 6 mL/kg, we measured cardiac index (CI) (PiCCO2), IVCDV and PPV before/during a PLR test and before/during a Vt challenge. A PLR-induced increase in CI ≥ 10% defined preload responsiveness. RESULTS: At baseline, IVCDV was not different between preload responders (n = 15) and non-responders. Compared to non-responders, PPV and IVCDV decreased more during PLR (by − 38 ± 16% and − 26 ± 28%, respectively) and increased more during the Vt challenge (by 64 ± 42% and 91 ± 72%, respectively) in responders. ∆PPV(PLR), expressed either as absolute or as percent relative changes, detected preload responsiveness (area under the receiver operating curve, AUROC: 0.98 ± 0.02 for both). ∆IVCDV(PLR) detected preload responsiveness only when expressed in absolute changes (AUROC: 0.76 ± 0.10), not in relative changes. ∆PPV(Vt), expressed as absolute or percent relative changes, detected preload responsiveness (AUROC: 0.98 ± 0.02 and 0.94 ± 0.04, respectively). This was also the case for ∆IVCDV(Vt), but the diagnostic threshold (1 point or 4%) was below the least significant change of IVCDV (9[3–18]%). CONCLUSIONS: During mechanical ventilation with Vt = 6 mL/kg, the effects of PLR can be assessed by changes in PPV. If IVCDV is used, it should be expressed in percent and not absolute changes. The effects of the Vt challenge can be assessed on PPV, but not on IVCDV, since the diagnostic threshold is too small compared to the reproducibility of this variable.

For specific, quantitative and on-site screening of Trichinella spiralis infection in livestock, a quantum dot nanobead-monoclonal antibody (QB-mAb) probe-based immunochromatographic assay (ICA) was developed by introducing a competitive sandwich strategy (QB-CICA). METHODS: In the QB-CICA, QB-mAb probes competed with serum antibody for a particular epitope, followed by immunocomplexes binding to capture antibody on the test line. With the accumulation of target antibody, captured probes served as signal elements for fluorescent readout in a “turn off” mode, along with the fluorescence gradually weakened. The sensitivity and standard calibration curve of the QB-CICA were quantified using swine sera as negative control (n = 200) and artificial infected swine sera (n = 80) compared with a commercial ELISA kit. Besides, Trichinella spiralis-antibody targeting test ability of the QB-CICA, instead of other parasites or viruses antibodies (n = 10), was evaluated. RESULTS: The QB-CICA exhibited a good linear range, a low detection limit of 189.92 ng mL(−1) and 100% selectivity that was higher than commercial ELISA kit (90%), as well as the same serological positive rate (100%) with commercial ELISA kit in different infection dose models. CONCLUSION: Taking advantage of its simplicity, short response time (25 min), sensitivity and specificity, the proposed QB-CICA has potential applications for parasite-related antibody monitoring in food safety and clinical diagnosis fields.","Xu, Ning; Liu, Yan; Li, Yansong; Tang, Bin; Liang, Xiongyan; Yang, Yuying; Liu, Mingyuan; Liu, Xiaolei; Zhou, Yu",Int J Nanomedicine,86,8

Of these, restaurant workers are among the high-risk professionals usually affected by WMSDs. In Ethiopia, evidence on the burden of musculoskeletal disorder and contributing factors among restaurant workers were very limited. Therefore, this study was aimed at assessing the prevalence of self-reported WMSDs and contributing factors among restaurant workers in Gondar city, northwest Ethiopia, 2020. METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2020 to March 2020 among restaurant workers in Gondar city. A two-stage sampling technique was used to choose 633 study subjects. A structured Nordic questioner was used to collect the data. Data was entered into EpiData version 3.1 and exported to Stata version 14.0 for analysis. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were computed. An adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used to measure the association between WMSDs and independent variables. In the multivariable analysis, a P value of <0.05 was used to declare a statistically significant association. To check the goodness of fit, the Hosmer and Lemeshow test was used. RESULTS: The prevalence of WMSDs among restaurant workers in the past 12 months was 81.5% [95% CI (78.18–84.44)]. Attending primary education [AOR: 2.14, 95% CI (1.17–3.90)], attending secondary education [AOR: 1.71 (1.02–2.86)], and job satisfaction [AOR: 1.90, 95%CI (1.13–3.19)] were significantly associated with WMSDs. CONCLUSION: In this study, the prevalence of WMSDs among restaurant workers was high. The upper back, lower back, elbow, and wrist were the most affected body parts. Age above 30 years, educational status being primary and secondary, and being dissatisfied by their job were positively associated with a high prevalence of WMSDs.","Tegenu, Habtamu; Gebrehiwot, Mulat; Azanaw, Jember; Akalu, Temesgen Yihunie",J Environ Public Health,86,5

Life-threatening neurodevelopmental dysfunctions are among the most common phenotypes observed in affected newborns. Risk factors that contribute to susceptibility and response to ZIKV infection may be related to the virus itself, the environment, and maternal genetic background. Nevertheless, the newborn’s genetic contribution to the critical illness is still not elucidated. Here, we aimed to identify possible genetic variants as well as relevant biological pathways that might be associated with CZS phenotypes. For this purpose, we performed a whole-exome sequencing in 40 children born to women with confirmed exposure to ZIKV during pregnancy. We investigated the occurrence of rare harmful single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) possibly associated with inborn errors in genes ontologically related to CZS phenotypes. Moreover, an exome-wide association analysis was also performed using a case-control design (29 CZS cases and 11 controls), for both common and rare variants. Five out of the 29 CZS patients harbored known pathogenic variants likely to contribute to mild to severe manifestations observed. Approximately, 30% of affected individuals carried at least one pathogenic or likely pathogenic SNV in genes candidates to play a role in CZS. Our common variant association analysis detected a suggestive protective effect of the rs2076469 in DISP3 gene (p-value: 1.39 x 10(−5)). The IL12RB2 gene (p-value: 2.18x10(-11)) also showed an unusual distribution of nonsynonymous rare SNVs in control samples. Finally, genes harboring harmful variants are involved in processes related to CZS phenotypes such as neurological development and immunity. Therefore, both rare and common variations may be likely to contribute as the underlying genetic cause of CZS susceptibility. The variations and pathways identified in this study may also have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies in the future.","Borda, Victor; da Silva Francisco Junior, Ronaldo; Carvalho, Joseane B.; Morais, Guilherme L.; Duque Rossi, Átila; Pezzuto, Paula; Azevedo, Girlene S.; Schamber-Reis, Bruno L.; Portari, Elyzabeth A.; Melo, Adriana; Moreira, Maria Elisabeth L.; Guida, Letícia C.; Cunha, Daniela P.; Gomes, Leonardo; Vasconcelos, Zilton F.

Parents expressed several challenges in supporting children’s health behaviors, the need for a tailored app, and alternative ways of accessing the content (audio/video). Nurses emphasized the need of supporting parents early, and the value of a shared platform in different languages, to facilitate communication. This study contributes valuable insights about parental needs and relevant adaptations to a parental support app, such as addition of audio/video files for increased accessibility.

Prestige-bias is proposed as an adaptive social-learning strategy as it provides a short-cut to identifying successful group members, without having to assess each person’s success individually. Previous work has documented prestige-bias and verified that it is used adaptively. However, the domain-specificity and generality of prestige-bias has not yet been explicitly addressed experimentally. By domain-specific prestige-bias we mean that individuals choose to learn from a prestigious model only within the domain of expertise in which the model acquired their prestige. By domain-general prestige-bias we mean that individuals choose to learn from prestigious models in general, regardless of the domain in which their prestige was earned. To distinguish between domain specific and domain general prestige we ran an online experiment (n = 397) in which participants could copy each other to score points on a general-knowledge quiz with varying topics (domains). Prestige in our task was an emergent property of participants’ copying behaviour. We found participants overwhelmingly preferred domain-specific (same topic) prestige cues to domain-general (across topic) prestige cues. However, when only domain-general or cross-domain (different topic) cues were available, participants overwhelmingly favoured domain-general cues. Finally, when given the choice between cross-domain prestige cues and randomly generated Player IDs, participants favoured cross-domain prestige cues. These results suggest participants were sensitive to the source of prestige, and that they preferred domain-specific cues even though these cues were based on fewer samples (being calculated from one topic) than the domain-general cues (being calculated from all topics). We suggest that the extent to which people employ a domain-specific or domain-general prestige-bias may depend on their experience and understanding of the relationships between domains.","Brand, Charlotte O.; Mesoudi, Alex; Morgan, Thomas J.

Hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in many of these mental benefits of exercise. However, precise mechanisms behind these effects are not well known. Released peripherally during exercise, beta-endorphins are an intriguing candidate for moderating increases in neurogenesis and the related behavioral benefits of exercise. Although historically ignored due to their peripheral release and status as a peptide hormone, this review highlights reasons for further exploring beta-endorphin as a key mediator of hippocampal neurogenesis. This includes possible routes for beta-endorphin signaling into the hippocampus during exercise, direct effects of beta-endorphin on cell proliferation and neurogenesis, and behavioral effects of manipulating endogenous opioid signaling. Together, beta-endorphin appears to be a promising mechanism for understanding the specific ways that exercise promotes adult neurogenesis specifically and brain health broadly.","Schoenfeld, Timothy J.; Swanson, Chance",Biomolecules,86,12

Just some species are indigenous to South Africa and have been traditionally utilized for centuries to cure various diseases and/or ailments. They have been recognized among the most famous and used medicinal plants in South Africa. Traditionally, the plants are used for various illnesses such as dropsy, respiratory disease, bone and joint complications, skin disorders, epilepsy and cancer. A number of studies have reported biological properties such as antiviral, antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anticancer activities. Their bulbs are a popular treatment for colds, measles, pneumonia, coughs, fever and headaches. However, some plant species are regarded as one of the six most common poisonous plants in Southern Africa that are toxic to livestock and humans. Due to the therapeutic effects of the Drimia plant bulb, research has focused on the phytochemicals of Drimia species. The principal constituents isolated from this genus are cardiac glycosides. In addition, phenolic compounds, phytosterols and other phytochemical constituents were identified. This study constitutes a critical review of Drimia species’ bioactive compounds, toxicology, biological properties and phytochemistry, advocating it as an important source for effective therapeutic medicine. For this purpose, various scientific electronic databases such as ScienceDirect, Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed and Web of Science were researched and reviewed to conduct this study. Despite well-studied biological investigations, there is limited research on the toxic properties and the toxic compounds of certain Drimia species.

Efficacious FCV vaccines protect against severe disease but not against infection. The high genetic diversity of FCV poses a challenge in vaccine design. Protection against FCV has been related to humoral and cellular immunity; the latter has not been studied in detail. This study investigates the cellular and humoral immune response of specified pathogen-free (SPF) cats after modified-live FCV F9 vaccinations and two heterologous FCV challenges by the analysis of lymphocyte subsets, cytokine mRNA transcription levels, interferon (IFN)-γ release assays in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), anti-FCV antibodies, and neutralisation activity. Vaccinated cats developed a Th1 cytokine response after vaccination. Vaccination resulted in antibodies with neutralising activity against the vaccine but not the challenge viruses. Remarkably, IFN-γ-releasing PBMCs were detected in vaccinated cats upon stimulation with the vaccine strain and the first heterologous FCV challenge strain. After the first experimental infection, the mRNA transcription levels of perforin, granzyme B, INF-γ, and antiviral factor MX1 and the number of IFN-γ-releasing PBMCs when stimulated with the first challenge virus were higher in vaccinated cats compared to control cats. The first FCV challenge induced crossneutralising antibodies in all cats against the second challenge virus. Before the second challenge, vaccinated cats had a higher number of IFN-γ-releasing PBMCs when stimulated with the second challenge virus than control cats.

Current knowledge of NDP-heptose originating from d-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate in Grampositive bacterium remains limited. Here, in silico analysis suggested that the special tridomain NDP-heptose synthetases with isomerase, kinase, and nucleotidyltransferase activities are conservatively distributed in Actinobacteria class of Gram-positive bacterium. Enzymatical characterization of the tridomain proteins from different strains showed that they are involved in ADP-d-glycero-β-d-manno-heptose biosynthesis despite the unexpected discovery of kinase activities deficient in some proteins. The presence of three types of NDP-heptose synthetases in Gram-positive bacterium suggests that it is also a rich source of heptoses and the heptose moieties may play important roles in vivo. Our work updates the understanding of NDP-heptose biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacterium and lays a solid foundation for further physiological function explorations.

A cross-sectional survey was conducted among middle-aged and elderly urban residents. A total of 1406 participants were included in the final data analysis. The results of the four models consistently showed that the relevant factors of RPA were educational level, previously diagnosed hypertension (PDH) and depression. In terms of educational level, compared with illiteracy, from the first model to the fourth model, the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of senior middle school were 2.072 (1.418, 3.026), 2.072 (1.418, 3.026), 1.905 (1.289, 2.816) and 1.926 (1.302, 2.848), respectively, and the ORs and 95% CIs of college or above were 2.364 (1.462, 3.823), 2.364 (1.462, 3.823), 2.001 (1.208, 3.312) and 2.054 (1.239, 3.405). In terms of PDH, compared with those with PDH, from the first model to the fourth model, ORs and 95% CIs of non-PDH were 1.259 (1.003, 1.580), 1.259 (1.003, 1.580), 1.263 (1.006, 1.585) and 1.261 (1.004, 1.584), respectively. For depression, compared with those without depression, also from the first model to the fourth model, ORs and 95% CIs of depression were 0.702 (0.517, 0.951), 0.702 (0.517, 0.951), 0.722 (0.532, 0.981) and 0.719 (0.529, 0.977), respectively.

Recent studies suggest however that niclosamide may have broader clinical applications in cancers, spurring increased interest in the functions and mechanisms of niclosamide. Previously, we reported that niclosamide targets a metabolic vulnerability in p53-deficient tumours, providing a basis for patient stratification and personalised treatment strategies. In the present study, we functionally characterised the contribution of the aniline 4′-NO(2) group on niclosamide to its cellular activities. We demonstrated that niclosamide induces genome-wide DNA damage that is mechanistically uncoupled from its antitumour effects mediated through mitochondrial uncoupling. Elimination of the nitro group in ND-Nic analogue significantly reduced γH2AX signals and DNA breaks while preserving its antitumour mechanism mediated through a calcium signalling pathway and arachidonic acid metabolism. Lipidomics profiling further revealed that ND-Nic-treated cells retained a metabolite profile characteristic of niclosamide-treated cells. Notably, quantitative scoring of drug sensitivity suggests that elimination of its nitro group enhanced the target selectivity of niclosamide against p53 deficiency. Importantly, the results also raise concern that niclosamide may impose a pleiotropic genotoxic effect, which limits its clinical efficacy and warrants further investigation into alternative drug analogues that may ameliorate any potential unwanted side effects.","Ngai, Tsz Wai; Elfar, Gamal Ahmed; Yeo, Pearlyn; Phua, Nicholas; Hor, Jin Hui; Chen, Shuwen; Ho, Ying Swan; Cheok, Chit Fang",Int J Mol Sci,86,17

An improved method for quick and accurate detection of E. tarda by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with two additional loop primers was developed by targeting the EsrB gene (EsrB — LAMP). In this method, the Mg(2+) concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction time were optimized to 8 mmol/L, 61°C, and 40 min, respectively. The detection limit with the EsrB gene was as low as 10 copies, which is 100 times more sensitive than that of conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The EsrB-LAMP assay was shown more sensitive and rapid than previously reported LAMP assays targeting the hemolysin gene ( hemolysin -LAMP) for detection of E. tarda. The EsrB -LAMP was also highly specific to E. tarda and had no cross-reaction with 13 other strains of bacteria. The assay can be carried out in a simple heating device and the EsrB-LAMP products can be visually detected by adding fluorescent dye to the reaction mixture. Taken together, the improved EsrB-LAMP diagnostic protocol has the potential for detection of E. tarda from indoor and outdoor samples.","Xie, Guosi; Zhang, Qingli; Han, Nana; Shi, Chengyin; Wang, Xiuhua; Liu, Qinghui; Huang, Jie",Chin,86,1

It could be months and at the current production rate may not provide timely protection to the population. Intervention strategies that control the spread of infection will be necessary in this situation, such as the use of the US stockpile of antiviral medication coupled with a 6-month school closure. The agent-based simulation model, EpiSimS, was used to assess the impact of this intervention strategy followed by three different vaccine approaches: (1) 2-dose, 80% effective, (2) 1-dose, 30% effective, and (3) 1 dose, 80% effective. Simulations show that the combination of antivirals, school closures, and a strain-specific vaccine can reduce morbidity and mortality while in effect. A significant second infection wave can occur with current vaccine technology once school closures are relaxed, though an ideal vaccine is able to contain it. In our simulations, worker absenteeism increases in all cases mostly attributed to household adults staying home with children due to the school closures.","Mniszewski, S. M.; Del Valle, S.

Instead of commonly used micro particles an optical tagging of the flow has been performed by using a caged dye. The pattern generation is done by imaging a mask for the first time. This allows to generate nearly any imaginable pattern. The flow induces a deformation of the optically written pattern that can be tracked by laser induced fluorescence. The series of raw images acquired in this way were analyzed quantitatively with a novel optical flow based technique. The reference measurements have been carried out allowing to draw conclusions about the accuracy of this procedure. A comparison to the standard technique of μPIV has also been conducted. Apart from measuring flow velocities in microfluidic mixing processes, the spatial distribution of concentration fields for different species has also been measured. To this end, a new technique has been developed that allows spatial measurements from Planar Spontaneous Raman Scattering (PSRS). The Raman stray light of the relevant species has been spectrally selected by a narrow bandpass filter and thus detected unaffectedly by the Raman stray light of other species. The successful operation of this measurement procedure in micro flows will be demonstrated exemplary for a mixing process of water and ethanol.","Roetmann, Karsten; Schmunk, Waldemar; Garbe, Christoph S.; Beushausen, Volker",Exp Fluids,86,1

We know packing plays a major role; the rate of transcription of a typical gene can vary over eight orders of magnitude (Ivarie et al. 1983), but deleting local elements like promoters and enhancers reduces expression by less than 5000-fold in transient transfection assays where the 3D “context” is missing. Common sense suggests the fiber cannot be packed randomly, but elucidating what any underlying order might be has proved difficult. First, the foldings of the chromatin fiber have dimensions below the resolution (≈200 nm) of the light microscope (LM) and so can only be seen by electron microscopy (EM), but then the fixation required can distort structure. Second, DNA is so long and packed so tightly it breaks and/or aggregates easily on isolation. Third, chromatin is poised in a metastable state so small charge alterations trigger changes in structure and function, and replacing the natural environment with our buffers often promotes aggregation.","Kimura, Hiroshi; Cook, Peter R.",Nuclear Dynamics,86,17

First we discuss the rigorous assessment of the risk, then we describe how our brain assesses the risk through the use of heuristics that are still rooted in animal evolution. Then we discuss the impact and the role of mass media and social networks in modulating risk perception. Next, we show how mathematical modelling is challenged by multi-scale epidemiological problems where the risk perception level is coupled with all the other microscopic and macroscopic levels.

A potent RTX cytotoxin with broad cellular specificity may play a role in disrupting the epithelial barrier and facilitating invasion of the bloodstream, possibly in concert with a viral coinfection. Once in the bloodstream, the organism can disseminate to sites of invasive disease, primarily the joints, bones, and endocardium. Survival in the bloodstream and dissemination are likely aided by expression of a capsular polysaccharide and an exopolysaccharide galactan.

We also argue that the most appropriate theoretical lens through which to investigate this relationship is that of the consumer empowerment paradigm. A conceptual model is proposed and tested. Our analysis of 345 sample respondents finds that perceived usefulness of ads and customer service experience expectations are important enablers to price comparison websites use. Similarly, we find that shopper innovativeness and customer service expectations, in addition to price comparison websites use, are significant enablers to eSwitching behaviour. However, contrary to prediction, we find that shopper innovativeness has little to no influence on shoppers’ use of price comparison websites; we also observed similar patterns concerning the link between the perceived usefulness of online ads and eSwitching behaviour. In conclusion, our research contributes to better understanding the influence of price comparison websites on online switching behavior, and the factors that might influence this relationship.","Kwarteng, Michael Adu; Jibril, Abdul Bashiru; Botha, Elsamari; Osakwe, Christian Nedu","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",86,1

We argue that a more consistent conceptualisation of media use behaviour and its etiological foundations is a necessary basis for research in this regard to progress. To this end, through the adoption of an affordances approach, we propose the Media Use Behaviour Conceptual Framework to describe the reciprocal relations between users (described in relation to personal characteristics and cognitive factors), the situations (consisting of social, physical, and technological dimensions) in which they use media, their media use behaviour, and the outcomes (both realised and expected) of this behaviour. This framework seeks to integrate the behaviourist and cognitivist approaches to action and, additionally, acknowledges the socially constructed and deterministic role of media in action. It is argued that such a framework will provide a useful basis upon which researchers can consider various individual differences in observed media use behaviours and associated outcomes and, importantly, understand why particular media use behaviours occur.","Parry, Douglas A.; le Roux, Daniel B.","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",86,1

Usually nodes on surfaces are used as sources to define the interpolation field that is propagated into the volume mesh by the RBF. The method comes with two distinctive advantages that makes it very flexible: it is mesh independent and it allows a node wise precision. There are however two major drawbacks: large data set management and excessive distortion of the morphed mesh that may occur. Two radial kernels are widely adopted to overtake such issues: the bi-harmonic spline (BHS) and the Wendland C2 (WC2). The BHS minimizes the mesh distortion but it is computational intense as a dense linear system has to be solved whilist the WC2 leads to a sparse system easier to solve but which can lack in smoothness. In this paper we compare these two radial kernels with a specific focus on mesh distortion. A detailed insight about RBF fields resulting from BHS and WC2 is first provided by inspecting the intensity and the distribution of the strain for a very simple shape: a square plate with a central circular hole. An aeronautical example, the ice formation onto the leading edge of a wing, is then exposed adopting an industrial software implementation based on the state of the art of RBF solvers.","Biancolini, Marco Evangelos; Chiappa, Andrea; Cella, Ubaldo; Costa, Emiliano; Groth, Corrado; Porziani, Stefano",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,86,17

The bottom wall of the enclosure is insulated, and heat exchange with the environment is modeled at other external boundaries. The heater with time-periodic heat generation is located at the bottom of the enclosure. The internal surfaces of both the heater and walls are assumed to be gray. Air is the working fluid and the Rayleigh number is 10(9). To solve the governing equations with dimensionless vorticity – stream function – temperature variables, the finite difference method has been used. The developed model has been validated through a comparison with data of other authors. The effect of surface emissivity and periodic heat generation on Nusselt numbers and both stream function and temperature distributions has been investigated. The results showed that the influence of the thermal radiation on total thermal transmission increases with surface emissivity of walls and heater surfaces. The present numerical method can be applied in several engineering problems, such as designing passive cooling systems and the simulation of heat transfer in building constructions.","Miroshnichenko, Igor; Sheremet, Mikhail",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,86,17

Kinetic equations are PDEs that model such particles in a position-velocity phase space. In the low collisional regime, explicit particle-based Monte Carlo methods simulate these high dimensional equations efficiently, but, as the collision rate increases, these methods suffer from severe time-step constraints. In the high collision regime, asymptotic-preserving particle schemes are able to produce stable results. However, this stability comes at the cost of a bias in the computed results. In earlier work, the multilevel Monte Carlo method was used to reduce this bias by combining simulations with large and small time steps. This multilevel scheme, however, still has large variances when correlating fine and coarse simulations, which leads to sub-optimal multilevel performance. In this work, we present an improved correlation approach that decreases the variance when bridging the gap from large time steps to time steps of the order of magnitude of the collision rate. We further demonstrate that this reduced variance results in a sharply reduced simulation cost at the expense of a small bias.","Løvbak, Emil; Mortier, Bert; Samaey, Giovanni; Vandewalle, Stefan",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,86,1

India is also suffering badly because of the current crisis, with more than 4 lakh people infected and 13000 deaths reported as on 20th June 2020. There is no respite in sight as of now as the numbers continue to increase exponentially with each passing day. The only possible control to the virus is the availability of a vaccine, which will take a few months to be available to masses. Till then, the global economy has to start reopening slowly with several precautionary measures in place as advised by the WHO, such as mandatory wearing of masks in public places, frequent hand washing, practising good personal hygiene, and social distancing. Recently, the government of India (GoI) has also opened its economy with all the precautionary measures in place. Disinfecting of places of work, modes of transport, hospitals, and common areas is emerging as a mammoth challenge. With the objective of arresting the spread of COVID-19 virus and providing an efficient solution to the above problem, a portable disinfectant device is designed. Undertaken as an Industry-academia collaboration, it is a joint initiative between Technopark@iitk (IIT Kanpur Research and Technology Park) and Industry. The novelty of this device lies in its innovative design that combines spraying of sanitising liquid and UV light-based disinfection methodologies. For this, the device uses two separate disinfection systems: (1) the pump-nozzle assembly for spraying the disinfectant, and (2) UV-C radiations to increase the virus kill efficiency.","Kumar, Dhananjay; Sonawane, Utkarsha; Gohil, Mahendra Kumar; Pol, Ravichand; Patil, Anand S.; Mittal, Reema; Agarwal, Avinash K.",Trans Indian Natl,86,19

However, a common issue in mastery learning is that persistence is not always productive, a construct termed wheel-spinning. In this paper, we extend on prior work to develop wheel-spinning detectors in the ASSISTments learning system that distinguish between non-persistence, productive persistence and wheel-spinning. To understand how quickly we can detect each state, we use data from different numbers of practice opportunities and compare model performance across student-problem set pairs. We identify that a model constructed using data from the first nine practice opportunities outperforms models using less practice data. However, it is possible to differentiate students who will eventually wheel-spin from learners who will persist productively using data from only the first three opportunities. Wheel-spinning can be differentiated from non-persistence from the first five opportunities, and non-persistence can be differentiated from productive persistence from the first seven opportunities. These results show that early differentiation between wheel-spinning and productive persistence is feasible. These detectors relied upon hint requests, the correctness of prior opportunities, and the amount of practice and time on the skill. Identifying predictive features offer insights into the impact of in-system behaviors on wheel-spinning and guide the system design.","Wang, Yeyu; Kai, Shimin; Baker, Ryan Shaun",Artificial Intelligence in Education,86,1

Of 12 distinct serogroups, A, B, C, W-135 (W) and Y cause the majority of infections. The meningococcal disease burden and epidemiology in India are not reliably known. Hence, we performed a narrative review with a systematically conducted search to summarize information on meningococcal disease burden and epidemiology and vaccination recommendations for meningococcal disease in India. METHODS: A search of Medline and Embase databases was undertaken to identify relevant publications published in the last 25 years. RESULTS: Results from 32 original publications, 11 of which were case reports, suggest a significant burden of meningococcal disease and related complications. Meningococcal disease is increasingly reported among adolescents and adults, and large outbreaks have been reported in this population. Meningococcal disease in India is caused almost exclusively by serogroup A; serogroups B, C, W and Y have also been documented. Meningococcal disease burden data remain unreliable because of limited disease surveillance, insufficient laboratory capacity, misdiagnosis and prevalence of extensive antibiotic use in India. Lack of access to healthcare also increases under-reporting, thus bringing the reliability of the data into question. Conjugate meningococcal vaccines are being used for disease prevention by national governments and immunization programs globally. In India, meningococcal vaccination is recommended only for certain high-risk groups, during outbreaks and for international travelers such as Hajj pilgrims and students pursuing studies abroad. CONCLUSION: Meningococcal disease is prevalent in India but remains grossly underestimated and under-reported. Available literature largely presents outbreak data related to serogroup A disease; however, non-A serogroup disease cases have been reported. Reliable epidemiologic data are urgently needed to inform the true burden of endemic disease. Further research into the significance of meningococcal disease burden can be used to improve public health policy in India.

Two well-known facets of the invisible hand are generally mentioned in the economics and finance literature - the first one is a static picture of a perfectly competitive market, i.e., a competitive market is efficient in an equilibrium; and the second one is that if the competitive market is disturbed from its equilibrium position, in the absence of a market failure and frictions, the market automatically settles at a new efficient equilibrium. This paper takes into account a third facet, i.e., how efficient is a perfectly competitive financial market on the dynamic adjustment path after an economic shock in the absence of all kinds of frictions and interest rate rigidities.

This study aims to highlight the commonly encountered CT findings in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Egypt and the mean severity score and its correlation with the imaging findings. This study involved 200 patients with pathologically confirmed COVID-19 infection; non-contrast CT chest was performed for all cases; in addition, CT findings and severity score (CT-SS) were then assessed using descriptive analysis, and the correlation between the CT findings and disease severity was assessed. RESULTS: The ground-glass densities and peripheral adhesions were the most typical CT findings. Prominent interlobular septations; bronchial thickening/dilatation; CT signs of crazy-paving, halo, and reversed halo; and reactive mediastinal lymphadenopathy were significantly correlated with disease severity. The mean CT-SS of Egyptian patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was 11.2 (mild to moderate severity). CONCLUSION: Multislice CT played a vital role in the early identification of Egyptian patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The assessment of the CT severity score of COVID-19 is essential for the extent of pneumonia involvement to help clinicians achieve the purpose of early diagnosis and accurate treatment.","Hafez, Mona A.

The Teenage Cancer Trust reported that 69% of young people with cancer saw their physiotherapist less than usual during the pandemic raising concerns about physiotherapy input. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all children’s therapy input managed under the Neuro Oncology Rehabilitation Team (NORT) between 1(st) April and 30(th) July 2020. Descriptive analysis of change to physiotherapy provision during this time period by Tertiary and local community services. RESULTS: 49 children were managed under the NORT Therapy Team during this timeframe. 9 children were newly diagnosed with CNS tumours. There was no impact on inpatient therapy provision, 3 had delayed local therapy provision on discharge requiring increased virtual input by the Tertiary centre. 40 children were outpatients managed under the NORT therapy team. 16 children were also receiving regular local physiotherapy input prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. 13 of these children subsequently had their local physiotherapy input suspended during this time period, 8 children were offered virtual input as an alternative by the Tertiary centre, 2 children received increased face to face appointments at the Tertiary centre. 14 of the 24 children managed solely under the Tertiary NORT Therapy Team changed to virtual therapy reviews. DISCUSSION: There is a clear change in therapy provision as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research should consider the effectiveness of neurorehabilitation conducted virtually and the impact on physical function of reduced local therapy provision in children with CNS tumours.","Hartley, Helen; Pizer, Barry; Kumar, Ram; Owen, Joanne; Paisley, Helen; White, Amillie",Neuro Oncol,86,1

However, only rudimentary theoretical and empirical insights exist on how sharing networks, i.e., focal firms, shared goods providers and customers, create and capture value in their sharing-based business models. We conduct a qualitative study to find key differences in sharing-based business models that are decisive for their value configurations. Our results show that (1) customization versus standardization of shared goods and (2) the centralization versus particularization of property rights over the shared goods are two important dimensions to distinguish value configurations. A second, quantitative study confirms the visibility and relevance of these dimensions to customers. We discuss strategic options for focal firms to design value configurations regarding the two dimensions to optimize value creation and value capture in sharing networks. Firms can use this two-dimensional search grid to explore untapped opportunities in the sharing economy.","Reuschl, Andreas; Tiberius, Victor; Filser, Matthias; Qiu, Yixin",Rev Manag Sci,86,24

The more terrible situation is that due to the overuse of antibiotics, especially in developing countries, people are struggling to fight with the bacteria variation. The emergence of super-bacteria will be an intractable environmental and health hazard in the future unless novel bactericidal weapons are mounted. Consequently, it is critical to develop viable antibacterial approaches to sustain the prosperous development of human society. Recent researches indicate that transition metal sulfides (TMSs) represent prominent bactericidal application potential owing to the meritorious antibacterial performance, acceptable biocompatibility, high solar energy utilization efficiency, and excellent photo-to-thermal conversion characteristics, and thus, a comprehensive review on the recent advances in this area would be beneficial for the future development. In this review article, we start with the antibacterial mechanisms of TMSs to provide a preliminary understanding. Thereafter, the state-of-the-art research progresses on the strategies for TMSs materials engineering so as to promote their antibacterial properties are systematically surveyed and summarized, followed by a summary of the practical application scenarios of TMSs-based antibacterial platforms. Finally, based on the thorough survey and analysis, we emphasize the challenges and future development trends in this area.

This is attributable, in part, to the resource-intensive nature of CBT for psychosis. Responses have included the development of CBT for psychosis in brief and targeted formats, and its delivery by briefly trained therapists. This study explored a combination of these responses by investigating a brief, CBT-informed intervention targeted at distressing voices (the GiVE intervention) administered by a briefly trained workforce of assistant psychologists. AIMS: To explore the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the GiVE intervention when delivered by assistant psychologists to patients with psychosis. METHOD: This was a three-arm, feasibility, randomised controlled trial comparing the GiVE intervention, a supportive counselling intervention and treatment as usual, recruiting across two sites, with 1:1:1 allocation and blind post-treatment and follow-up assessments. RESULTS: Feasibility outcomes were favourable with regard to the recruitment and retention of participants and the adherence of assistant psychologists to therapy and supervision protocols. For the candidate primary outcomes, estimated effects were in favour of GiVE compared with supportive counselling and treatment as usual at post-treatment. At follow-up, estimated effects were in favour of supportive counselling compared with GiVE and treatment as usual, and GiVE compared with treatment as usual. CONCLUSIONS: A definitive trial of the GiVE intervention, delivered by assistant psychologists, is feasible. Adaptations to the GiVE intervention and the design of any future trials may be necessary.","Hayward, Mark; Berry, Katherine; Bremner, Stephen; Jones, Anna-Marie; Robertson, Sam; Cavanagh, Kate; Gage, Heather; Berry, Clio; Neumann, Suzanne; Hazell, Cassie M; Fowler, David; Greenwood, Kathryn; Strauss, Clara",BJPsych Open,86,22

Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 480 nurses, midwives, and administrative workers in four educational hospitals of Ardabil, Iran. Research tools were included demographic information questionnaire, NASA-TLX questionnaire, job description index (JDI) questionnaire and job control inquiry. Results: Compared with administrative workers, mental workload of nurses and midwives was significantly higher and likewise mental workload of nurses was significantly difference compared to midwives (P < 0.001). Nurses and midwives had substantially higher job satisfaction than administrative workers (P < 0.001). Also, nurses and midwives had higher job control than administrative workers (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). Based on the designed model, the correlation between mental workload and job satisfaction was negative and significant (r = −0.22); which in the presence of job control, the relationship between the two variables of workload and job satisfaction slightly increased (r = −0.19, P < 0.001). These conditions were the same in the three job groups separately. Conclusion: Mental workload is inversely related to job satisfaction and job control. Job control plays an important role in improving working conditions in healthcare workers.","Rostami, Fatemeh; Babaei-Pouya, Amin; Teimori-Boghsani, Gholamheidar; Jahangirimehr, Azam; Mehri, Zahra; Feiz-Arefi, Maryam",Front Public Health,86,1

However, as observed in nonphagocytic cells, ROS play essential roles in processes that are different from pathogen killing, as signal transduction, differentiation, and gene expression. The different outcomes of these events are likely to depend on the specific subcellular site of ROS formation, as well as the duration and extent of ROS production. While excessive accumulation of ROS has long been appreciated for its detrimental effects, there is now a deeper understanding of their roles as signaling molecules. This could explain the failure of the “all or none” pharmacologic approach with global antioxidants to treat several diseases. NADPH oxidase is the first source of ROS that has been identified in macrophages. However, growing evidence highlights mitochondria as a crucial site of ROS formation in these cells, mainly due to electron leakage of the respiratory chain or to enzymes, such as monoamine oxidases. Their role in redox signaling, together with their exact site of formation is only partially elucidated. Hence, it is essential to identify the specific intracellular sources of ROS and how they influence cellular processes in both physiological and pathological conditions to develop therapies targeting oxidative signaling networks. In this review, we will focus on the different sites of ROS formation in macrophages and how they impact on metabolic processes and inflammatory signaling, highlighting the role of mitochondrial as compared to non-mitochondrial ROS sources.","Canton, Marcella; Sánchez-Rodríguez, Ricardo; Spera, Iolanda; Venegas, Francisca C.; Favia, Maria; Viola, Antonella; Castegna, Alessandra",Front Immunol,86,1

This study uses an improved apoptosis probe ((99m)Tc-hAnxA5) in combination with [(18)F]FDG imaging to evaluate therapy response. PROCEDURES Daudi tumor tissue was implanted in the spleen of SCID mice. Treatment was performed with adriamycin and cyclophosphamide. Sequential [(18)F]FDG-positron emission tomography (PET) was acquired over 6 days and (99m)Tc-hAnxA5-SPECT was performed before and 1 day after therapy. RESULTS On day 1, therapy induced apoptosis was visualized with (99m)Tc-hAnxA5 without a measurable change in [(18)F]FDG uptake. [(18)F]FDG uptake decreased significantly on day 3 and was even more pronounced on day 6. CONCLUSION In this preclinical model, (99m)Tc-hAnxA5 imaging was able to detect apoptosis before metabolic changes were measured. These results confirm the value of apoptosis imaging for therapy response and give more insight in [(18)F]FDG imaging and its parameters to evaluate response.","De Saint-Hubert, Marijke; Wang, Huijun; Devos, Ellen; Vunckx, Kathleen; Zhou, Lin; Reutelingsperger, Chris; Verbruggen, Alfons; Mortelmans, Luc; Ni, Yicheng; Mottaghy, Felix M",Molecular imaging and biology : MIB : the official publication of the Academy of Molecular Imaging,86,1

Benefits of bariatric surgery, however, extend well beyond weight loss and include dramatic improvement of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and reduction of overall mortality. Furthermore, studies in rodents and humans show that the anti-diabetes effect of certain bariatric procedures results from a variety of neuroendocrine and metabolic mechanisms secondary to changes in GI anatomy. The recognition that benefits and mechanisms of GI operations are not limited to weight reduction provided a rationale for the emergence of metabolic surgery intended as a surgical approach primarily aimed to the treatment of diabetes and metabolic disease. Consistent with the goals of improving glycemic and metabolic control, in contrast to mere weight loss, metabolic surgery implies the development of a new model of care distinct from traditional bariatric surgery.

But the mechanism is not clear. We aimed to evaluate the effect of HP on gastric compliance and volumes in obese patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred fifty-nine patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy due to morbid obesity were enrolled in the study and were divided into two groups as HP+ (n = 86) and HP- (n = 73) according to the HP status in resection materials. Demographics, pathological data, specimen sizes, volume, and compliance were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS The median age of the study group was 34 years (17-64 years) while the median BMI was 43 kg/m2 (35-64, 3 kg/m2). Most of the patients (n = 134, 84.3%) were female. The median diameter of the widest point of the specimen was 22.5 cm (14-32 cm), and the median volume of the specimen was 790 cc (330-1920 cc). Both the diameter of the widest point and the volume of the specimens were significantly increased in the HP+ group compared to the HP- group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.017, respectively). In addition, the median compliance was 52.6 cc/mmHg, and the compliance was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the HP+ group. There were no significant differences in specimen sizes between the two groups. CONCLUSION This is the first study showing that HP increases gastric compliance in obese patients who underwent LSG. The etiology and the effects of this increase in compliance have not been fully clarified yet. Further studies are needed to shed light on these effects.","Kaplan, Kuntay; Turgut, Emre; Okut, Gokalp; Bag, Yusuf Murat; Sumer, Fatih; Kayaalp, Cuneyt",Obesity surgery,86,27

The L1 ORFs, commonly used for phylogenetic identification, share 76 per cent similarity with each other and differ 32 per cent from any other known PV, indicating that these new strains meet the criteria for defining novel species. PV genes phylogenetic variance was analyzed and different degrees of saturation revealed similar levels of topological heterogeneity, ruling out saturation as primary etiological factor for this phenomenon. Interestingly, the two CpenPV strains form a monophyletic clade within the Gammapapillomavirus genus (provisionally named gammapapillomavirus 32). Unlike for other NP PV strains, which grouped into a new sister genus of Alphapapillomavirus, this is the first report of NP PV strains grouping into a genus previously considered to exclusively comprise Old World Primates (OWP) PVs, including human PVs. These findings confirm the existence of a common ancestor for Gammapapillomavirus already infecting primates before the split of OWP and NP at ∼40 million years ago. Finally, our findings are consistent with an ancient within-species diversity model and emphasize the importance of increasing sampling to help understanding the PV-primate codivergence dynamics and pathogenic potential.","D'arc, Mirela; Moreira, Filipe R R; Dias, Cecilia A; Souza, Antonizete R; Seuánez, Héctor N; Soares, Marcelo A; Tavares, Maria C H; Santos, André F A",Virus evolution,86,19

VZV reactivation in enteric neurons (enteric zoster) can cause non-specific abdominal pain and/or serious gastrointestinal dysfunction without cutaneous manifestations. Detection of VZV DNA in saliva may be useful for identifying enteric zoster. We evaluated the frequency of putative enteric zoster based on the presence of salivary VZV DNA in patients with acute abdominal pain. METHODS Adult patients who visited the emergency room due to moderate to severe acute abdominal pain were prospectively enrolled at a tertiary hospital between May 2019 and November 2019. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (APCT) was performed in all patients. We also evaluated the presence of salivary VZV DNA in patients with confirmed coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) who were under stressful conditions. Saliva samples were collected from all studied patients. Enteric zoster was suspected based on the presence of salivary VZV DNA, detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS Fifty patients with moderate to severe abdominal pain were enrolled. Five of 50 patients exhibited positive VZV-DNA PCR results. APCT revealed that among these five patients, two had pancreatic head cancer, two had small bowel obstruction after intra-abdominal surgery, and one had no remarkable findings. However, all 14 patients with COVID-19 showed negative salivary VZV-DNA PCR results. CONCLUSIONS Approximately 10% of patients with moderate to severe acute abdominal pain showed positivity for salivary VZV DNA. Further studies are warranted on whether antiviral therapy based on salivary VZV-DNA PCR results may relieve abdominal pain in the studied patient population.

OBJECTIVES This study examined the levels of work intention, stress and professionalism of nurses and determine the relationship between nursing work intention and factors in response to COVID-19. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted on 362 nurses from COVID-19-devoted hospitals in Iran. A self-administered electronic-based questionnaire was developed and used to determine levels of stress, professionalism, and nursing intention. Multiple regression analysis was carried out to analyze the correlation between nursing intention with respect to stress and professionalism. RESULTS The overall stress, professionalism, and nursing intention scores were 48.56, 21.46, and 17.83 respectively. There were significant differences in nursing intention scores between gender, marital status, and having training groups (p < 0.05). The regression analysis revealed that nursing intention had a significant relationship with older age (p < 0.001, S.E = 1.11,B = 17.02), higher income level (p < 0.001,S.E = 1.81,B = 6.98), having previous training (p = 0.008,S.E = 1.22,B = 3.27), higher stress level (p < 0.001,S.E = 2.37,B = -21.39), and high professionalism level (p < 0.001,S.E = 1.16,B = 11.99). CONCLUSION Having an adequate staff requirement plan, planning appropriate training for nurses, and proactive psychological support are crucial to prevent burnout and continue to provide nursing services.","Zandian, Hamed; Alipouri-Sakha, Minoo; Nasiri, Elhameh; Zahirian Moghadam, Telma",Work,86,17

An approach to characterizing the risks posed by persons with communicable infectious diseases.",13.332478,8.949466,2009,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomographic Score (ASPECTS) has been used to estimate diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion volume in acute stroke. We aimed to assess correlations of DWI-ASPECTS with lesion volume in different middle cerebral artery (MCA) subregions and reproduce existing ASPECTS thresholds of a malignant profile defined by lesion volume ≥100 mL. METHODS We analyzed data of patients with MCA stroke from a prospective observational study of DWI and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery in acute stroke. DWI-ASPECTS and lesion volume were calculated. The population was divided into subgroups based on lesion localization (superficial MCA territory, deep MCA territory, or both). Correlation of ASPECTS and infarct volume was calculated, and receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis was performed to identify the optimal ASPECTS threshold for ≥100-mL lesion volume. RESULTS A total of 496 patients were included. There was a significant negative correlation between ASPECTS and DWI lesion volume (r=-0.78; P<0.0001). With regards to lesion localization, correlation was weaker in deep MCA region (r=-0.19; P=0.038) when compared with superficial (r=-0.72; P<0.001) or combined superficial and deep MCA lesions (r=-0.72; P<0.001). Receiver-operating characteristics analysis revealed ASPECTS≤6 as best cutoff to identify ≥100-mL DWI lesion volume; however, positive predictive value was low (0.35). CONCLUSIONS ASPECTS has limitations when lesion location is not considered. Identification of patients with malignant profile by DWI-ASPECTS may be unreliable. ASPECTS may be a useful tool for the evaluation of noncontrast computed tomography. However, if MRI is used, ASPECTS seems dispensable because lesion volume can easily be quantified on DWI maps.","Schröder, Julian; Cheng, Bastian; Ebinger, Martin; Köhrmann, Martin; Wu, Ona; Kang, Dong-Wha; Liebeskind, David S; Tourdias, Thomas; Singer, Oliver C; Christensen, Soren; Campbell, Bruce; Luby, Marie; Warach, Steven; Fiehler, Jens; Fiebach, Jochen B; Gerloff, Christian; Thomalla, Götz",Stroke,86,31

METHODS We recruited current adult and pediatric fellows and 2020 graduates of nephrology training programs in the United States to participate in a survey measuring COVID-19's effects on their training experiences and wellbeing. RESULTS Of 1005 nephrology fellows-in-training and recent graduates, 425 participated (response rate 42%). Telehealth was widely adopted (90% for some or all outpatient nephrology consults), as was remote learning (76% of conferences were exclusively online). Most respondents (64%) did not have in-person consults on COVID-19 inpatients; these patients were managed by telehealth visits (27%), by in-person visits with the attending faculty without fellows (29%), or by another approach (9%). A majority of fellows (84%) and graduates (82%) said their training programs successfully sustained their education during the pandemic, and most fellows (86%) and graduates (90%) perceived themselves as prepared for unsupervised practice. Although 42% indicated the pandemic had negatively affected their overall quality of life and 33% reported a poorer work-life balance, only 15% of 412 respondents who completed the Resident Well-Being Index met its distress threshold. Risk for distress was increased among respondents who perceived the pandemic had impaired their knowledge base (odds ratio [OR], 3.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.00 to 4.77) or negatively affected their quality of life (OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 2.29 to 5.46) or work-life balance (OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 2.18 to 4.71).

Pediatric oncology patients are uniquely vulnerable to infection, but whether this predisposes them to different patterns of RVIs than healthy children is unknown. There is also limited data on the impact of RVIs on cancer patients. We conducted a retrospective study of children ages 1-21 with cancer presenting to the clinic and emergency department (ED) and a randomly selected subset of patients without cancer presenting to the ED who had positive nasopharyngeal viral polymerase chain reactions at our institution from 2014 to 2019. Sixty-seven cancer patients (206 RVI episodes) and 225 pediatric non-cancer patients (237 RVI episodes) were included. Human rhino/enterovirus (HRE) was the most common infection in both groups in the spring, summer, and fall. In the winter, the most common RVI was influenza in cancer patients verses respiratory syncytial virus in non-cancer patients. On age-adjusted analysis, the likelihood of detecting coronavirus in the winter, HRE in the spring and fall, and parainfluenza in the summer was significantly greater in cancer patients (OR = 2.60, 2.52, 5.73, 3.59 respectively). Among cancer RVI episodes, 50% received parenteral antibiotics, 22% were severely neutropenic, 22% had chemotherapy delays for a median of six days, 16% were hospitalized, and 6% received intravenous immunoglobulin. We conclude that there are differences in the seasonal patterns of RVIs between children with and without cancer. RVIs also cause significant morbidity in children with cancer.","Dror, Tal; Akerman, Meredith; Noor, Asif; Weinblatt, Mark E; Islam, Shahidul; Glasser, Chana L",Pediatric hematology and oncology,86,19

MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical trial. Subjects (N = 100) underwent implantation of the IVC filter and were followed for 180 days; subjects whose filters were later removed were followed for 30 days thereafter. The primary objective was to determine whether the one-sided lower limit of the 95% CI for the observed clinical success rate was at least 80%. Clinical success was defined as technical success (deployment of the filter such that it was judged suitable for mechanical protection from PE) without subsequent PE, significant filter migration or embolization, symptomatic caval thrombosis, or other complications. RESULTS Technical success was achieved in 100% of subjects. There were eight cases of recurrent PE, two cases of filter migration (23 mm), and three cases of symptomatic caval occlusion/thrombosis (one in a subject who also experienced filter migration). No filter embolization or fracture occurred. Clinical success was achieved in 88% of subjects; the one-sided lower limit of the 95% CI was 81%. Retrieval was successful at a mean of 67.1 days after implantation (range, 1-175 d) for 36 of 39 subjects (92.3%). All deaths (n = 17) and deep vein thromboses (n = 18) were judged to have resulted from preexisting or intercurrent illnesses or interventions and unrelated to the filter device; all deaths were judged to be unrelated to PE.

However, cuff pressure is rarely measured, and clinicians estimate cuff pressure poorly. The goal of the present study was to predict the cuff volume that produces optimal cuff pressure either from tracheal diameter or from patient height and age. METHODS In the development phase, initial cuff pressure and cuff volume were measured in 240 patients. Optimal cuff volume, defined as the volume halfway between the volumes required to produce cuff pressures of 20 and 30 cmH(2)O, was determined in each patient. Then, regression equations relating optimal cuff volume to tracheal diameter on chest X-ray, and between optimal cuff volume and a combination of height and age, were calculated. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in a validation set (n = 104) who achieved a cuff pressure of 20-30 cmH(2)O when cuff volume was selected by each regression formula. RESULTS Only 28% of the cuffs were optimally inflated using clinical criteria during the development phase. There was good correlation between optimal cuff volume and tracheal diameter and moderate correlation between optimal cuff volume and both height and age. Predicted cuff volume was more likely to provide optimal cuff pressure when based on tracheal diameter (65% of patients) than when based on both height and age (45% of patients). CONCLUSIONS Optimal cuff volume was better estimated from tracheal diameter and patient height and age than from the manual palpation method.","Shibasaki, Masayuki; Nakajima, Yasufumi; Shime, Nobuaki; Sawa, Teiji; Sessler, Daniel I",Journal of anesthesia,86,1

An association between triple low and postoperative mortality has been reported but was not replicated in a subsequent study. The authors pooled existing data from clinical trials to further evaluate the purported association in an observational study. METHODS This retrospective observational study included 13,198 patients from three clinical trials: B-Unaware, BAG-RECALL, and Michigan Awareness Control Study. Patients with greater than 15 not necessarily consecutive minutes of triple low were propensity matched to controls with similar characteristics and comorbidities. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the association between triple low duration and postoperative mortality. RESULTS Thirty-day mortality was 0.8% overall, 1.9% in the triple low cohort, and 0.4% in the nontriple low cohort (odds ratio, 5.16; 95% CI, 4.21 to 6.34). After matching and adjusting for comorbidities, cumulative duration of triple low was significantly associated with an increased risk of mortality at 30 days (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.11, per 15 min) and 90 days (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.11, per 15 min). CONCLUSION There is a weak independent association between the triple low state and postoperative mortality, and the propensity-matched analysis does not suggest that this is an epiphenomenon.","Willingham, Mark D; Karren, Elliott; Shanks, Amy M; O'Connor, Michael F; Jacobsohn, Eric; Kheterpal, Sachin; Avidan, Michael S",Anesthesiology,86,12

DATA SOURCES We searched grey literature including websites of national research and ethics regulatory bodies and health departments of selected countries. STUDY SELECTION National guidance documents were included from six countries: Ireland, England, Australia, New Zealand, the United States of America and Canada. DATA EXTRACTION Data were extracted from 19 documents using an a priori framework developed from the published literature. RESULTS We organised data under five themes: ethical frameworks; guidance on ethical review; consent, vulnerable groups and personal health data. Quality improvement activity tended to be outside the scope of the ethics frameworks in most countries. Only New Zealand had integrated national ethics standards for both research and quality improvement. Across countries, there is consensus that this activity should not be automatically exempted from ethical review, but requires proportionate review or organisational oversight for minimal risk projects. In the majority of countries, there is a lack of guidance on participant consent, use of personal health information and inclusion of vulnerable groups in routine quality improvement. CONCLUSION Where countries fail to provide specific ethics frameworks for quality improvement, guidance is dispersed across several organisations which may lack legal certainty. Our review demonstrates a need for appropriate oversight and responsive infrastructure for quality improvement underpinned by ethical frameworks that build equivalence with research oversight. It outlines aspects of good practice, especially The New Zealand framework that integrates research and quality improvement ethics.","Naughton, Corina; Meehan, Elaine; Lehane, Elaine; Landers, Ciara; Flaherty, Sarah Jane; Lane, Aoife; Landers, Dr Margaret; Kilty, Caroline; Saab, Mohamad M; Goodwin, John; Walshe, Nuala; Wills, Teresa; McCarthy, Vera; Murphy, Siobhan; McCarthy, Joan; Helen, Cummins; Madden, Deirdre; Hegarty, Josephine",International journal for quality in health care : journal of the International Society for Quality in Health Care,86,24

KSA is at risk of outbreaks of MD due to its geographic location, demography, and especially because it hosts the annual Hajj and Umrah mass gatherings. Preventative measures for Hajj and Umrah include vaccination, targeted chemoprophylaxis, health awareness and educational campaigns, as well as an active disease surveillance and response system. Preventative measures have been introduced and updated in accordance with changes in the epidemiology of MD and available preventative tools. The mandatory meningococcal vaccination policy for pilgrims has possibly been the major factor in preventing outbreaks during the pilgrimages. The policy of chemoprophylaxis for all pilgrims arriving from the African meningitis belt has also probably been important in reducing the carriage and transmission of Neisseria meningitidis in KSA and beyond. The preventative measures for Hajj and Umrah are likely to continue to focus on vaccination, but to favour the conjugate vaccine for its extra benefits over the polysaccharide vaccines. Additionally, the surveillance system will continue to be strengthened to ensure early detection and response to cases and outbreaks; ongoing disease awareness campaigns for pilgrims will continue, as will chemoprophylaxis for target groups. Local and worldwide surveillance of the disease and drug-resistant N. meningitidis are crucial in informing future recommendations for vaccination, chemoprophylaxis, and treatment. Preventative measures should be reviewed regularly and updated accordingly, and compliance with these measures should be monitored and enhanced to prevent MD during Hajj and Umrah, as well as local and international outbreaks.","Yezli, Saber; Bin Saeed, Abdulaziz A; Assiri, Abdullah M; Alhakeem, Rafat F; Yunus, Muslim A; Turkistani, Abdulhafiz M; Booy, Robert; Alotaibi, Badriah M",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,86,1

66279,66279,66279,High mortality from viral pneumonia in patients with cancer.,13.46821,8.814122,2019,"INTRODUCTION Procalcitonin expression is thought to be stimulated by bacteria and suppressed by viruses via interferon signalling. Consequently, during respiratory viral illness, clinicians often interpret elevated procalcitonin as evidence of bacterial coinfection, prompting antibiotic administration. We sought to evaluate the validity of this practice and the underlying assumption that viral infection inhibits procalcitonin synthesis. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalised with pure viral infection (n=2075) versus bacterial coinfection (n=179). The ability of procalcitonin to distinguish these groups was assessed. In addition, procalcitonin and interferon gene expression were evaluated in murine and cellular models of influenza infection. RESULTS Patients with bacterial coinfection had higher procalcitonin than those with pure viral infection, but also more severe disease and higher mortality (p<0.001). After matching for severity, the specificity of procalcitonin for bacterial coinfection dropped substantially, from 72% to 61%. In fact, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that procalcitonin was a better indicator of multiple indices of severity (eg, organ failures and mortality) than of coinfection. Accordingly, patients with severe viral infection had elevated procalcitonin. In murine and cellular models of influenza infection, procalcitonin was also elevated despite bacteriologic sterility and correlated with markers of severity. Interferon signalling did not abrogate procalcitonin synthesis. DISCUSSION These studies reveal that procalcitonin rises during pure viral infection in proportion to disease severity and is not suppressed by interferon signalling, in contrast to prior models of procalcitonin regulation. Applied clinically, our data suggest that procalcitonin represents a better indicator of disease severity than bacterial coinfection during viral respiratory infection.","Gautam, Samir; Cohen, Avi J; Stahl, Yannick; Valda Toro, Patricia; Young, Grant M; Datta, Rupak; Yan, Xiting; Ristic, Nicholas T; Bermejo, Santos D; Sharma, Lokesh; Restrepo, Marcos; Dela Cruz, Charles S",Thorax,86,1

Social determinants of health are increasingly recognized as a driving force of health inequities. It is well established that food insecurity leads to adverse health outcomes outside of pregnancy such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and mental health problems. However, little is known about the impact of food insecurity during pregnancy on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Food insecurity and other social determinants of health are rarely addressed as part of routine obstetric care. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has only exacerbated the crisis of food insecurity across the country, disproportionally affecting women as well as racial and ethnic minorities. Women's health providers should implement universal screening for maternal food insecurity and offer resources to women struggling to feed themselves and their families. Reducing maternal health inequities in the US includes recognizing and addressing food insecurity, along with other social determinants of health, and advocating for public policies that support and protect all women's right to healthy food during pregnancy.","Dolin, Cara D; Compher, Charlene C; Oh, Jinhee K; Durnwald, Celeste P",American journal of obstetrics & gynecology MFM,86,17

BACKGROUND The terms ""metabolic"" and ""diabetes surgery"" indicate a surgical approach whose primary intent is the control of metabolic alterations/hyperglycemia in contrast to ""bariatric surgery,"" conceived as a mere weight-reduction therapy. METHODS A ""metabolic surgery"" program distinct from the ""bariatric surgery"" program was recently established at a tertiary US academic medical center. The 2 programs differ in their stated goals but offer the same procedures and use identical eligibility criteria for patients with morbid obesity. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and 30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality were assessed from a prospective database of 200 consecutive patients who underwent surgery at these units. RESULTS Metabolic surgery patients were older (45.8±13.4 v 41.8±11.7, P<0.05), had a lower body mass index (42.4±7.1 vs 48.6±9.5 kg/m; P<0.01), and a higher prevalence of being of the male sex (42% vs 26%, P<0.05), having diabetes (62% vs 35%; P<0.01), hypertension (68% vs 52%; P<0.05), dyslipidemia (48% vs 31%; P<0.05), and cardiovascular disease (14% vs 5%; P<0.05). Diabetes was more severe among metabolic surgery patients (higher glycated hemoglobin levels; greater percentage of insulin use). There was no mortality, and there were no differences in perioperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Offering surgery to treat metabolic disease or diabetes rather than as a mere weight-reduction therapy changes demographical and clinical characteristics of surgical candidates. This has important and practical ramifications for clinical care and support consideration of metabolic/diabetes surgery as a novel practice distinct from traditional bariatric surgery.","Rubino, Francesco; Shukla, Alpana; Pomp, Alfons; Moreira, Marlus; Ahn, Soo Min; Dakin, Gregory",Annals of surgery,86,20

The most significant risk following major hepatectomy is postoperative liver insufficiency. Current preoperative assessment of the future liver remnant relies upon assumptions which may not be valid in the setting of advanced resection strategies. This paper reports the feasibility of the ALIIVE technique which assesses the liver remnant with ICG clearance intraoperatively during vascular exclusion. Methods. 10 patients undergoing planned major liver resection (hemihepatectomy or greater) were recruited. Routine preoperative assessment included CT and standardized volumetry. ICG clearance was measured noninvasively using a finger spectrophotometer at various time points including following parenchymal transection during inflow and outflow occlusion before vascular division, the ALIIVE step. Results. There were one case of mortality and three cases of posthepatectomy liver failure. The patient who died had the lowest ALIIVE ICG clearance (7.1%/min versus 14.4 ± 4.9). Routine preoperative CT and standardized volumetry did not predict outcome. Discussion/Conclusion. The novel ALIIVE technique is feasible and assesses actual future liver remnant function before the point of no return during major hepatectomy. This technique may be useful as a check step to offer a margin of safety to prevent posthepatectomy liver failure and death. Further confirmatory studies are required to determine a safety cutoff level.","Lau, Lawrence; Christophi, Christopher; Nikfarjam, Mehrdad; Starkey, Graham; Goodwin, Mark; Weinberg, Laurence; Ho, Loretta; Muralidharan, Vijayaragavan","HPB surgery : a world journal of hepatic, pancreatic and biliary surgery",86,24

Severe mucosal surface lesions were observed grossly in the oral cavity, larynx, and esophagus. Mucosal lesions varied from small (1-3 mm) infrequent mucosal ulcerations to large (5 mm to 1 cm) and coalescing ulcerations. Necrotic debris was present in ulcerations of some mortalities with some having plaque-like debris, but other mortalities presented more proliferative lesions. A calf persistently infected with BVDV arrived with one lot and the isolated virus was genotyped as BVDV-1b. Identical BVDV-1b strains were isolated from 2 other mortalities. A BVDV-2a genotype was also isolated in this outbreak. This genotype was identical to all BVDV-2a strains isolated in both lots. Serum samples were collected from exposed and unexposed animals and tested for antibodies for multiple viral pathogens. Seropositivity ranged from zero percent for calicivirus to 100% positive to Pseudocowpox virusx. At the end of the feeding period, the morbidity and mortality for the 2 lots involved was 76.2% and 30.8%, respectively, for lot A, and 49.0% and 5.6%, respectively, for lot B. Differential diagnoses included vesicular stomatitis viruses, Bovine papular stomatitis virus, and Foot-and-mouth disease virus. Based on the present case, acute BVDV should be considered when mucosal lesions are observed grossly.","Hessman, Bill E; Sjeklocha, David B; Fulton, Robert W; Ridpath, Julia F; Johnson, Bill J; McElroy, Diana R","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",86,1

BACKGROUND Selection of primary retrograde approach (PRA) and the optimal timing to switch from antegrade to retrograde approach for coronary CTO-PCI is still debatable. METHODS Using the Japanese CTO-PCI expert registry data, we selected and analyzed 4461 patients who underwent CTO-PCI via PAA alone. The considerable lesion/anatomical factors for GWMT ≥20 and 30 min were analyzed. The risks of prolonged GWMT ≥20 and 30 min were stratified as easy, intermediate, difficult, and very difficult according to the multivariate analysis. RESULTS Nine lesion/anatomical characteristics (blunt stump, side branch at proximal cap, bifurcation at the exit point, calcification, tortuosity, occlusion length ≥ 20 mm, reattempt, nonleft anterior descending artery (nonleft anterior descending artery [LAD]), and tandem CTO) were independent predictors of GWMT ≥20 min (all p < 0.05). Excluding the nonLAD and tandem CTO, the same factors of GWMT ≥20 min correlated with GWMT ≥30 min (all p < 0.05). The distributions were increased in easy, intermediate, difficult, and very difficult subsets of GWMT ≥20 min (58.3%, 77.2%, 89.1%, and 100%) and GWMT ≥30 min (47.5%, 69.2%, 83.9%, and 100%). CONCLUSIONS These predictive factors of prolonged GWMT should be assessed before CTO-PCI via PAA and when considering an adequate timing to switch the retrograde or PRA if clinically available.","Ochiumi, Yusuke; Yamamoto, Masanori; Tsuchikane, Etsuo; Muramatsu, Toshiya; Kishi, Koichi; Okada, Hisayuki; Oikawa, Yuji; Muto, Makoto; Kawasaki, Tomohiro; Yoshikawa, Ryohei; Otsuka, Toshiaki",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,86,31

Emergence of antiviral resistance is a major impediment in the control of the coinfection. In this paper, a deterministic mathematical model illustrating the transmission dynamics of influenza pneumonia coinfection is formulated having incorporated antiviral resistance. Optimal control theory is then applied to investigate optimal strategies for controlling the coinfection using prevalence reduction and treatment as the system control variables. Pontryagin's maximum principle is used to characterize the optimal control. The derived optimality system is solved numerically using the Runge-Kutta-based forward-backward sweep method. Simulation results reveal that implementation of prevention measures is sufficient to eradicate influenza pneumonia coinfection from a given population. The prevention measures could be social distancing, vaccination, curbing mutation and reassortment, and curbing interspecies movement of the influenza virus.","Kanyiri, Caroline W; Luboobi, Livingstone; Kimathi, Mark",Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,86,11

Within the species Canis familiaris individual breeds, such as the bloodhound or beagle, are known as olfactory stars. These are ""scent breeds,"" a grouping variably defined as a genetic clade or breed class commonly used for scent detection tasks. Previous work suggests that the dog has a more robust olfactory anatomy than many mammal species. Now we undertake a closer investigation of the dog's olfactory system, both in relationship to its closest wild relatives, the wolf and coyote, and across individual breeds. First, we seek to resolve whether the dog has lost olfactory capacity through its domestication from the wolf lineage. Second, we test the inertial lore that among dogs, ""scent breeds,"" have a superior olfactory facility. As a measure of relative olfactory capacity, we look to the cribriform plate (CP), a bony cup in the posterior nasal cavity perforated by passageways for all olfactory nerve bundles streaming from the periphery to the brain. Using high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans and digital quantification, we compare relative CP size in 46 dog breeds, the coyote and gray wolf. Results show the dog has a reduced CP surface area relative to the wolf and coyote. Moreover, we found no significant differences between CP size of ""scent"" and ""non-scent"" breeds.

The aim of this study was to investigate the biological effect of Cpne7 on the proliferation, migration, and cementoblast differentiation of periodontal cells in vitro, and on the regeneration of periodontal tissue using periodontal defect model with canine in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS The effect of Cpne7 on cell proliferation, migration, and cementoblast differentiation of periodontal cells were evaluated in vitro. A periodontal defect canine model was designed and the defects were divided into five groups: Group 1: No treatment (negative control), Group 2: Collagen carrier only, Group 3: PA-CM with collagen carrier (positive control), Group 4: PA-CM + CPNE7 Antibody (Ab) with collagen carrier, and Group 5: recombinant CPNE7 (rCPNE7) protein with collagen carrier. RESULTS Cpne7 was expressed in HERS cells and periodontal ligament (PDL) fibers. By real-time PCR, Cpne7 increased expression of Cap compared to the control. In the periodontal defect canine model, rCPNE7 or PA-CM regenerated periodontal complex, and the arrangement of the newly formed PDL-like fibers were perpendicular to the newly formed cementum and alveolar bone like Sharpey's fibers in natural teeth, while PA-CM + CPNE7 Ab showed irregular arrangement of the newly formed PDL-like fibers compared to the rCPNE7 or PA-CM group. CONCLUSION These findings suggest that Cpne7 may have a functional role in periodontal regeneration by supporting periodontal cell attachment to cementum and facilitating physiological arrangement of PDL fibers.","Choung, Han-Wool; Lee, Dong-Seol; Park, Yeoung-Hyun; Lee, Yoon Seon; Bai, Shengfeng; Yoo, Su-Hyang; Lee, Jong-Ho; You, Hyung-Keun; Park, Joo-Cheol",Connective tissue research,86,16

There is paucity of data on outcomes in pediatric SOT recipients. METHODS This is a cross-sectional study investigating the prevalence of COVID-19 infection and outcomes in pediatric SOT (heart, liver, and kidney) recipients. We extracted demographic and clinical characteristics and COVID-19 testing (PCR or [Ab] test) results from medical records. Clinical characteristics were compared between patients who were positive for COVID-19 (PCR or Ab) and those who did not, using Mann-Whitney, Student's t test, or chi-square test. p value <.05 was statistically significant. RESULTS A total of 108 SOT recipients with a median age of 13.1 (8.4, 17.8) years and median 4.2 (2.7, 7.9) years from transplant were checked for COVID-19 via a PCR or Ab test. A positive PCR was confirmed in 10 patients (9.3%), while 12 patients (11.1%) were positive for COVID-19 Ab. The patients who tested positive in our cohort were 9/50 (18%) heart, 6/68 (8.8%) kidney, and 7/50 (14%) liver transplant recipients. There were no differences in the clinical characteristics between patients with and without COVID-19 infection. All patients were either asymptomatic (50%) or had self-limiting symptoms. No changes were made to the immunosuppressive regimen. Only one patient was hospitalized and none had an oxygen requirement.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional study examined413 emerging adults, ages 18-25, from the Type 1 Diabetes Exchange Clinic Registry. Data were collected viaREDCap surveys using the Personal Financial Well-Being Scale, Willingness to Pay Scale, Financial Independence Visual Analog Scale, Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, The Type 1 Diabetes Distress Scale, and Diabetes Quality of Life Measure. Hierarchical Multiple Regression analyses explored significant barriers to self-management outcomes. RESULTS Hierarchical Multiple Regression analyses revealed that 20.6% of variance in HbA1c (F=15.555, p<.001) was explained by greater financial stress (β=-.197, p<.001), willingness to pay (β=-.220, p < .001), disease duration (β = .119, p = .014), and diabetes distress (β=.181, p<.001); 64.5% of the variance in diabetes-related quality of life (F=148.469, p<.001) wassignificantly explained by greater financial stress (β=-.112, p = .002), diabetes distress (β=.512, p<.001), trait anxiety (β=.183, p=.001) and depressive symptoms (β=.162, p=.001).

We compared EL and ES for stump closure during LA for complicated appendicitis in children. METHODS All LA for complicated appendicitis performed between July 2005 and August 2009 were assessed prospectively. EL were used in 37 procedures and ES in 31. Apart from choice of technique which was the personal preference of the attending surgeon, all patients were managed according to the same intraoperative and postoperative protocols. RESULTS There was no significant difference between mean age at operation; gender ratio; mean preoperative and postoperative white blood cell; mean preoperative and postoperative white blood cell C-reactive protein; histopathology; mean operating time (EL: 71 minutes; ES: 64 minutes); mean hospitalization (EL: 5.3 days; ES: 5.1 days); febrile period (EL: 2.1 days; ES: 1.9 days); white blood cell normalization (EL: 2.6 days; ES: 2.4 days); and intravenous antibiotic usage (EL: 3.8 days; ES: 3.7 days). There were no intraoperative complications or ICU admissions in either group, but two EL cases required conversion to open surgery (P=NS). Incidences of intra-abdominal abscess (EL: n=1 or 2.7%; ES: n=1 or 3.2%), transient ileus (EL: n=2 or 5.4%; ES: n=2 or 6.4%), small bowel obstruction (EL: n=0; ES: n=0), and wound infection (EL: n=1 or 2.7%; ES: n=1 or 3.2 %) were not significantly different. Rate of rehospitalization for EL was 2.7% (n=1; colitis), and for ES, it was 3.2% (n=1; intra-abdominal abscess) (P=NS). Mean cost for EL was US$890, and for ES, it was US$1300. CONCLUSION This is the first prospective study comparing EL and ES during LA for complicated appendicitis in children. ES is more expensive, but there was no significant difference in morbidity for this technique, particularly with regard to incidence of postoperative intra-abdominal abscess.","Miyano, G; Urao, M; Lane, Gj; Kato, Y; Okazaki, T; Yamataka, A",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,86,13

We aimed to determine whether any clinical manifestation of CES, as stated in Royal College of Radiology guidelines, could predict the presence of established CES on MRI. We also aimed to support a larger study to develop a more universal assessment tool for acute lower back pain.A retrospective analysis of consecutive patients who warranted urgent MRI was conducted. Seventy-nine patients were eligible for study. The Kendall's tau test was used for statistical analysis of all data. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be significant. MRI was performed in 62 patients out of 79.A total of 32.9% of patients had scans within 24 hours of admission. Nine of these patients were referred to neurosurgery for urgent neurosurgical review. Of these, 6.3% of patients had an established CES on MRI scan. One patient who had an out-patient MRI spine (15 days from hospital presentation) was found to have an established CES, was urgently referred to spinal surgery and underwent primary fenestration excision of the lumbar vertebra. No clinical features that were able to predict the presence of an established CES on MRI were elucidated.

Our goal was to review the indications and outcomes of TAMIS in a large series. STUDY DESIGN A review of a prospective database identified patients who underwent TAMIS from 2010 to 2014. Demographic, perioperative, short-term outcomes, and recurrence data were analyzed. RESULTS There were 75 patients with 76 lesions analyzed. Mean age was 64.0 years (SD 11.6 years) and mean BMI was 27.4 kg/m(2) (SD 4.7 kg/m(2)). Median American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score was 2 (range 1 to 4). There were 59 benign (77.3%) and 17 malignant (22.7%) lesions: 6 pT0, 6 pT1, 4 pT2, and 1 pT3. Median lesion distance from the anal verge was 10 cm (range 6 to 16 cm). Mean operative time was 76.0 minutes (SD 36.1 minutes). Three patients had intraperitoneal entry; all were closed transanally, but 2 had temporary diverting ileostomies fashioned to ensure healing. Median length of stay was 1 day (range 0 to 6). One patient had a fragmented lesion (1.3%). Five patients had positive margins: 2 in palliative pT2 resections, and 3 in pT1, pT2, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients. They were managed with radical resection (pT1 and pT2 lesions) and surveillance/medical oncology (GIST). Postoperatively, 3 patients had complications (bleeding, rectal stricture, and recto-vaginal fistula), and all were managed nonoperatively. After median follow-up of 39.5 months (range 10.5 to 65.3 months), 1 pT1 patient with negative margins developed a local recurrence and underwent salvage APR. CONCLUSIONS Transanal minimally invasive surgery is a viable option for excision of benign or early stage rectal masses, with mid-term oncologic outcomes comparable to those of radical resection. Further, TAMIS minimizes the morbidity and can allow more patients to benefit from the minimally invasive approach.","Keller, Deborah S; Tahilramani, Reena N; Flores-Gonzalez, Juan R; Mahmood, Ali; Haas, Eric M",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,86,31

Fortunately, most children display only mild-to-moderate symptoms, but there are a subset that will have severe symptoms warranting treatment. This review evaluates the current evidence for antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment of acute SARS-COV-2 infections, including coronavirus disease 2019 in pediatrics. RECENT FINDINGS Treatment recommendations continue to evolve with emerging results from clinical trials. Initial therapies were tailored to repurposed medications, and have now transitioned toward more specific antiviral therapy. In addition to specific antiviral therapy, there is also support to modulate the immune system and reduce inflammatory damage seen in coronavirus disease 2019. Much of the data result from adult studies with subsequent extrapolation to pediatrics. SUMMARY Recommended therapy will continue to adapt as results return from clinical trials. A continued commitment from the National Institutes of Health and research community to assist in determining optimal therapies for pediatric patients is essential. Until then, most recommendations will likely be informed from the results seen in adult populations.","Murphy, Mark E; Clay, Gwendolyn; Danziger-Isakov, Lara; Schulert, Grant; Paulsen, Grant C",Current opinion in pediatrics,86,1

Pet animals are sentinels of human exposure, as they share a common living environment with humans. In this study, 58 pet (cat and dog) foods and 78 pet feces samples were collected from Albany, New York, USA, for the analysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polycarbonate (PC) by alkali-assisted thermal depolymerization and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) methods. PET was detected at concentrations in the range of <1,500 ng/g to 12,000 ng/g (median: <1,500 ng/g) and <1,500 to 4,600 ng/g (median: <1500 ng/g) in cat and dog foods, respectively. The concentrations of PET in cat (<2,300-340,000 ng/g, median: 61,000 ng/g) and dog (7700-190,000 ng/g, median: 30,000 ng/g) feces were one to two orders of magnitude higher than those in food samples. A significant positive correlation was found between the concentrations of the monomers (i.e., TPA and BPA) and the corresponding MPs in cat feces. The calculated mean estimated daily intake of PET and PC (calculated from pet food) was lower than that of the mean cumulative daily intake (calculated from pet feces), which suggested that diet is a minor source of pet exposure to PET and PC.","Zhang, Junjie; Wang, Lei; Kannan, Kurunthachalam",Environmental science & technology,86,16

The strategy was simple: in times of extreme difficulty a cool head combined with stoicism is an appropriate response to ensure a successful outcome. The latest major challenge to society (COVID-19) met with a very different response, and only history will reveal whether 'Stay home and worry' will be equally effective. In devising blueprints or strategies it is extremely important to have a clear idea of what you are trying to achieve, whether it be maintaining world freedom or stopping a pandemic. In the case of livestock agriculture, it is helping to feed a rapidly growing global population in harmony with the needs of current and future generations. I hope that I have stated this clearly, and calmly. If so, I ask you to picture a scene. We are on a Calm Farm. Dairy animals go about their daily lives contented, unhurried and focused on the simple feeding and socialising activities that are so important to them. Unstressed, their productive capacities and abilities to avoid and, when necessary, cope with physiological and pathological challenges are maximised. They are not alone: the exact same characteristics also apply to the farmer and husbandry staff that we meet. How is this calm farming approach relevant to the aspirations we had when we established the EU COST Action DairyCare? Our objective was to harness the power of computing technologies to assist our management of dairy livestock. A simple rearrangement leads us to Computing Assisted Livestock Management, CALM. In this short Research Reflection I shall assess how far we have come towards the achievement of sensible goals related to technological assessment of dairy animal wellbeing, and speculate on what more things both can and need to be done to finish the job. It is a personal account. DairyCare was a major collaboration involving several hundred active researchers. To involve them all would be impossible, and I do not pretend to speak for them all. As will become evident, the wide skills base that was assembled was so successful in its primary objectives that different skills, chiefly in economics, are now needed to exploit all of the technological advance that has been achieved. DairyCare succeeded in a second direction. Whilst the focus was technology development, by assembling a large cohort of biologists with animal welfare interests, it soon became apparent that technology should run alongside and help to enable improved management practices. This Special Issue is, therefore, in two sections. The first is dedicated to technology development and the second to a novel management practice that has the potential to significantly improve the wellbeing of cows and calves: cow-calf contact rearing. That section is introduced by my DairyCare colleague, Sigrid Agenäs.","Knight, Christopher H",The Journal of dairy research,86,1

A registry study was undertaken to describe evolution of patient characteristics and assess the real-world effectiveness/safety of empagliflozin. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data from the Diabetes Patienten Verlaufsdokumentation (DPV)/Diabetes Versorgungsevaluation (DIVE) registries on 9571 adults with T2DM (registered in 2014-2019) receiving empagliflozin were used. Patients were grouped according to the following: early users (group 1; n=505) received empagliflozin before the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study publication (mid-September 2015); intermediate users (group 2; n=2961) started empagliflozin after the EMPA-REG OUTCOME publication but before the European Medicines Agency label change (from mid-September 2015 to mid-January 2017); and late users (group 3; n=6105) started empagliflozin after mid-January 2017. Data on clinical and treatment characteristics were collected. RESULTS Over time, the proportion of recipients aged <65 years decreased (71.1% vs 54.4% among early and late adopters), male patients increased (from 50.9% to 66.5%), body mass index (mean±SD) decreased (from 35.5±6.7 to 32.7±6.6 kg/m2), proportion with cardiovascular morbidities increased (from 20.4% to 26.4%), and mean estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased (from 83.2±19.5 to 78.5±21.1 mL/min/1.73 m2) (all p<0.001). Patients increasingly received empagliflozin in combination with metformin (60.8% vs 68.6% of early and late adopters; p<0.001), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists (11.0 vs 14.1%; p<0.001) or insulin (34.3% vs 49.9%; p<0.001). Empagliflozin was generally added to existing antidiabetic regimens. Six months after empagliflozin initiation, the mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) decreased by 0.4%, the proportion of patients with HbA1c <6.5% increased (19.2% vs 12.8%), and the mean fasting plasma glucose decreased (155.8±49.7 vs 168.0±55.1 mg/dL) (all p<0.001). No significant changes in rates of severe hypoglycemia and no cases of diabetic ketoacidosis were seen. CONCLUSIONS Over time, empagliflozin is being prescribed to a broader patient range in routine practice, is usually added to existing antidiabetic regimens, and is increasingly used in combination with metformin, GLP-1 agonists and/or insulin. Empagliflozin had a beneficial effect on glycemic control, with no increase in hypoglycemia.","Bramlage, Peter; Tittel, Sascha R; Wagner, Christian; König, Kerstin; Raddatz, Dirk; Weber-Lauffer, Rosmarie; Erath, Diether; Hilgenberg, Jost; Spies, Carsten; Danne, Thomas; Gabler, Maximilian; Foersch, Johannes; Ley, Ludwin; Seufert, Jochen",BMJ open diabetes research & care,86,1

The safety of PVP-I topically applied to the nasal and oral cavity is addressed by a literature review. The specific efficacy of PVP-I against coronaviruses and its potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 is discussed. METHODS A review was performed utilizing PubMed and Cochrane Databases. All citations in protocols for nasal and oral PVP-I use regarding COVID-19 were independently reviewed. RESULTS Povidone-iodine has been safely administered for up to 5 months in the nasal cavity and 6 months in the oral cavity. Concentrations less than 2.5% in vitro do not reduce ciliary beat frequency or cause pathological changes in ciliated nasal epithelium, upper respiratory, or mucosal cells. Adverse events with oral use have not been reported in conscious adults or children. Allergy and contact sensitivity is rare. Chronic mucosal use up to 5% has not been shown to result in clinical thyroid disease. PVP-I is rapidly virucidal and inactivates coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). CONCLUSIONS Povidone-iodine can safely be used in the nose at concentrations up to 1.25% and in the mouth at concentrations up to 2.5% for up to 5 months. Povidone-iodine rapidly inactivates coronaviruses, including SARS and MERS, when applied for as little as 15 seconds.

METHODS Between April and May 2020, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in 152 family caregivers of PwD who were clients of daycare service prior to the pandemic. The survey examined caregivers' stress and challenges faced during daycare service cessation, their perceived needs for continuation of daycare service, and observed changes in functional status of PwD. Regression analyses were performed to explore the associated factors of caregiving stress and preference for continuation of daycare service. RESULTS Family caregivers of PwD experienced greater caregiving stress after cessation of daycare service. Infection was their main challenge in caregiving, and their physical and emotional health was adversely affected by the longer time commitment with PwD under the stay-home policy. Older age of caregivers, greater emotional and communication problems of PwD, and more time spent with PwD were associated with greater caregiving stress. More than one-third of the participants preferred the continuation of daycare service during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Policy makers should consider the well-being of PwD and their caregivers when planning infection control measures. Daycare service with enhanced infection controlled measures should remain available to PwD during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article is protected by copyright.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a routinely measured biomarker, and reduction in its levels after initiation of therapy may predict inpatient mortality. METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, the charts of patients who were admitted to Montefiore Medical Center between March 10, 2020, and May 2, 2020 for the management of COVID-19 were examined. Of all patients who met inclusion criteria, patients who received corticosteroid treatment were categorized as CRP responders (≥50% CRP level reduction) and CRP nonresponders (<50% CRP level reduction) based on change in CRP within 72 hours of corticosteroid treatment initiation. The outcomes of interest were two-fold: (1) CRP response after treatment with corticosteroid, and (2) differences in mortality among patients with CRP response compared those without. RESULTS Of 2,707 patients admitted during the study period, 324 received corticosteroid treatment. Of patients who received corticosteroid treatment, CRP responders had reduced risk of death compared with risk among CRP nonresponders (25.2% vs 47.8%; unadjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.21-0.65; P < .001). This effect remained strong and significant after adjustment for potential confounders (adjusted OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.14-0.54; P < .001). CONCLUSION Reduction in CRP by 50% or more within 72 hours of initiating corticosteroid therapy potentially predicts inpatient mortality. This may serve as an early biomarker of response to corticosteroid therapy in patients with COVID-19.","Cui, Zhu; Merritt, Zachary; Assa, Andrei; Mustehsan, Hashim; Chung, Erica; Liu, Sichen; Kumthekar, Anand; Ayesha, Bibi; McCort, Margaret; Palaiodimos, Leonidas; Baron, Sarah; Averbukh, Yelena; Southern, William; Arora, Shitij",Journal of hospital medicine,86,16

The estimated COVID-19 deaths during such a full cycle of the pandemic ranged from 1.58 to 8.76 millions over 5 years. The model for the worst case scenario with 8.76 million deaths assumes a population infection rate (PIR) of 60%, the frequently quoted PIR for ""heard immunity"".1 Being well aware of the limitations and variance around such estimates, I see an imperative need to put the COVID-19 pandemic into perspective with the overall burden of diseases. Regarding global deaths per year, it has been estimated that about 6.4 millions can be attributed to smoking, about 9 millions (probably much more in 2020) to hunger and hunger-related diseases, and roughly 10 millions to consequences of high blood pressure.","Pilz, Stefan",European journal of clinical investigation,86,30

METHODS From June 2010 on we have been using the SRBS for superficial layer closure during open and laparoscopic PN in two European centers. These data were collected prospectively and matched with historical PN cases performed with conventional suture. Cases were matched for PADUA score, surgical approach (laparoscopic or open) and the center where surgery was performed. Comparisons were made in patient characteristics and perioperative outcomes including warm ischemia time (WIT), changes in hemoglobin (Hb), changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and perioperative complications between the SRBS and non-SRBS groups. Statistical tests of significance were performed using Student's t test and chi-square test for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. RESULTS Thirty-one consecutive cases of PN under WIT were performed with SRBS. These cases were matched with cases from the historical database of PN performed with conventional suture. The rate of perioperative complications was statistically significantly lower in the SRBS cohort (6.5 vs. 22.6 %, p = 0.038). Mean ischemia time was 19.6 min (SD, 7.5) in the SRBS group versus 21.8 min (SD, 9.5) in the conventional suture group (p = 0.312). There were no significant differences between groups for postoperative changes in creatinine, eGFR and Hb. Limitations of this study include the absence of randomization and the relative small sample size. CONCLUSIONS SRBS can be safely used during partial nephrectomy. SRBS reduces significantly the number of perioperative complications.","Zondervan, Patricia J; Gozen, Ali S; Opondo, Dedan; Rassweiler, Jens J; de la Rosette, Jean J; Laguna, M Pilar",World journal of urology,86,1

Prescribers and patients who use, misuse, or, in some cases, redistribute or divert these drugs have figured prominently in government strategies aimed at addressing this issue. This review departs from this paradigm and focuses on wholesale drug distributors, a highly efficient and largely behinds-the-scene link in the supply chain of controlled substances. By law, distributors are required to identify and report to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) orders for controlled substances that are suspicious and may indicate drug diversion. Ten cases are examined in which distributors were each charged with failing to prevent the diversion of millions of doses of controlled substances. Special attention is given to a payment system employed by the industry that may encourage this unlawful commerce. Court records, agency and industry reports, and other published sources are used to document referenced cases and their disposition, and recommendations are offered for improving distributors' compliance with the law.","Coleman, John J",Journal of pain & palliative care pharmacotherapy,86,1

Travel may pose health risks for the individual and contribute to the global spread of infectious diseases. The specialty of travel medicine is aimed at minimizing health risks associated with international travel. The field has emerged in the past 25 years, and the evidence base supporting its clinical practice is growing. This review will describe the evidence base underlying travel medicine, highlight recently updated travel medicine guidelines, and outline future research priorities. RECENT FINDINGS Recommendations for a number of common vaccines for travelers have been updated recently. More sophisticated detection methods are leading to the identification of a wider spectrum of pathogens associated with travelers' diarrhea, and antibiotic resistance is increasingly being identified. New treatment options for malaria are available, and a fifth Plasmodium species causing disease in humans has been identified. SUMMARY An evidence base for the practice of travel medicine is emerging. Expert opinion and consensus guidelines continue to play an important role in supporting clinical practice.","LaRocque, Regina C; Jentes, Emily S",Current opinion in infectious diseases,86,17

Many interventions have been developed to reduce and/or eliminate human foodborne pathogens in poultry products; however, treatments with cold plasma or carnosine or a combination of both interventions have not been extensively investigated. In this communication, the bacterial microflora of poultry meat samples after treatments with cold plasma and carnosine were characterized with EcoPlates ™ in the OmniLog ® system. The plates were incubated at 25 o C for seven days in the OmniLog ® chamber, and bacterial growth was monitored by recording formazan production every 30 minutes at OD 590 nm . The kinetics of lag, log and stationary phases of the bacterial growth patterns followed the Gompertz sigmoidal model, but with different inflection times and asymptotes at the log phase and the stationary phase, respectively. Results indicated that treating poultry meat samples with cold plasma technology and carnosine could inhibit growth of the bacteria in the treated meat samples. Of 31 chemicals tested, phenylethylamine, α- D -lactose, D,L -α-glycerol phosphate, 2-hydroxybenzoic acid, γ-hydroxybutyric acid, α-ketobutyric acid or D -malic acid could not be metabolized by bacteria in the meat samples. Future research is required to determine whether these seven chemicals that inhibit growth of bacteria from the meat samples can be used as food preservatives for extending shelf-life of these products. Whether the bacterial flora be as an indicator of effectiveness for meat samples treated with cold plasma, carnosine or both needs further study.","Yeh, Hung-Yueh; Line, John E; Hinton, Arthur; Gao, Yue; Zhuang, Hong",Journal of food protection,86,1

Readers will gain information on the patent inhibitors, including chemical structures, original sources or synthetic methods, biological assays and application potential. EXPERT OPINION It is difficult to identify compounds that interact with the function not relevant with peptide-hydrolysis of APN in the enzyme activity assay, and such compounds have not been reported in the patents during the past 5 years. The progress of protein-small molecule interaction detecting means, such as surface plasmon resonance, will possibly help develop such compounds for the treatment of relevant diseases or new molecular probes in mechanism investigation.","Su, Li; Fang, Hao; Xu, Wenfang",Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,86,1

DESIGN Scoping review. STUDY SAMPLE Literature including hearing outcome measurements for the treatment of conductive and/or mixed hearing loss. RESULTS The literature search identified 1434 studies, with 278 subsequently selected for inclusion. A total of 837 hearing outcome measures were reported and grouped into nine domains. The largest domain constituted pure-tone threshold measurements accounting for 65% of the total outcome measures extracted, followed by the domains of speech testing (20%) and questionnaires (9%). Studies of hearing implants more commonly included speech tests or hearing questionnaires compared with studies of middle ear surgery.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 76 trials. Most trials examined the effects on PTSD (62%). The effect size of EMDR compared to control conditions was g = 0.93 (95% CI: 0.67-.18), with high heterogeneity (I2= 72%). Only four of 27 studies had low risk of bias, and there were indications for publication bias. EMDR was more effective than other therapies (g = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.14-0.57), but not in studies with low risk of bias. Significant results were also found for EMDR in phobias and test anxiety, but the number of studies was small and risk of bias was high. EMDR was examined in several other mental health problems, but for none of these problems, sufficient studies were available to pool outcomes. EMDR may be effective in the treatment of PTSD in the short term, but the quality of studies is too low to draw definite conclusions. There is not enough evidence to advise it for the use in other mental health problems.","Cuijpers, Pim; Veen, Suzanne C van; Sijbrandij, Marit; Yoder, Whitney; Cristea, Ioana A",Cognitive behaviour therapy,86,24

Surgical repair can be accomplished using challenging abdominal or transperineal approaches. A laparoscopic repair using a Proceed mesh might be an easy and effective alternative. METHODS We describe a multi-center case-series of twelve patients with a symptomatic perineal hernia treated by laparoscopic mesh repair. A cone-shaped 10 × 15 cm Proceed Mesh was tacked to the promontory or sacrum and sutured to the pelvic sidewalls and the anterior peritoneum. RESULTS Twelve patients underwent laparoscopic repair of their perineal hernia. Four men and eight women presented with a symptomatic perineal hernia after abdominoperineal excision between 2008 and 2013 and underwent a laparoscopic repair with a Proceed mesh. The median age at presentation was 53 years (range 39-68 years). The mean total theater time was 119 min (range 75-200 min). No conversion to an open procedure was needed. No early complications where seen. The mean hospital stay was 2.25 days (range 1-4 days). Three patients showed recurrence, of whom two had a defect in the middle of the proceed mesh, one had a defect anterior to the previous perineal hernia. All 3 patients underwent a redo-laparoscopic repair with mesh. CONCLUSION In this case series we present an alternative approach for the surgical repair of perineal hernias. Based on our experience, perineal hernia after APE can be repaired safely and effectively using the described laparoscopic technique.","Goedhart-de Haan, A M S; Langenhoff, B S; Petersen, D; Verheijen, P M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,86,1

OBJECTIVE : To study how the risk factors for recurrent wheezing and asthma vary by different definitions of bronchiolitis. METHODS : Viral etiology and atopic characteristics were studied in 259 hospitalized wheezing children (median age, 14 months; range, 0-36 months). The data were analyzed according to age (<6, <12, <24 and <36 months) and whether they had a history or no history of a previous wheezing episode. Sixteen viruses were detected by conventional and molecular methods. Atopic characteristics included the presence of eczema, specific and total IgE responses, blood eosinophil count, and modified asthma predictive index. RESULTS : Evidence of respiratory virus infection was found in 93% of the cases and allergic sensitization in 26% of the cases. Rhinovirus infections and atopic characteristics (sensitization, blood eosinophil count, and modified asthma predictive index) increased by age and were significantly more common in children with recurrent wheezing episodes than in first-time wheezers in age categories of <24 and <36 months (P < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS : In children with bronchiolitis, 2 clinical factors, age and number of previous wheezing episodes, are linked to inflammatory (atopy-related factors) and virologic risk factors of asthma (rhinovirus-associated disease). According to current US and UK guidelines, bronchiolitis includes wheezing children <24 months of age. Our observations suggest that the clinical definition should include only children with their first episode of wheezing.","Jartti, Tuomas; Lehtinen, Pasi; Vuorinen, Tytti; Ruuskanen, Olli",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,86,1

A notable portion of these unplanned visits are the result of expected complications or normal recovery after surgery, suggesting that improved coordination and communication in the outpatient setting could potentially prevent these. Telemedicine can improve patient-physician communication and as such may have a role in limiting unplanned emergency department visits and readmissions in postoperative patients. METHODS Major electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials and cohort studies in surgical patients examining the effect of postoperative telemedicine interventions with a communication feature on 30-day readmissions and emergency department visits as compared to current standard postoperative follow-up. All surgical subspecialties were included. Two independent reviewers assessed eligibility, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias using standardized tools. Our primary outcomes of interest were 30-day ED visits and readmissions. Our secondary outcomes were patient satisfaction with the intervention. RESULTS 29 studies were included in the final analysis. Fourteen studies were RCTs, and the remaining fifteen were cohort studies. Eighteen studies reported 30-day ED visit as an outcome. There was no overall reduction in 30-day ED visit in the telemedicine group (RR: 0.89, 95%CI: 0.70-1.12). Twenty-two studies reported 30-day readmission as an outcome. The overall pooled estimate did not show a difference in this outcome (RR: 0.90, 95%CI: 0.74-1.09). Fifteen studies reported a metric of patient satisfaction regarding utilization of the telemedicine intervention. All studies demonstrated high levels of satisfaction (> 80%) with the telemedicine intervention. DISCUSSION This review fails to demonstrate a clear reduction ED visits and readmissions to support use of a telemedicine intervention across the board. This may be in part explained by significant heterogeneity in the proportions of potentially preventable visits in each surgical specialty. As such, targeting interventions to specific surgical settings may prove most useful.","Eustache, Jules; El-Kefraoui, Charbel; Ekmekjian, Taline; Latimer, Eric; Lee, Lawrence",Surgical endoscopy,86,1

Accelerated surgery may improve outcomes by reducing the duration of these states and immobility. We undertook a pilot trial to determine the feasibility of a trial comparing accelerated care (i.e., rapid medical clearance and surgery) and standard care among patients with a hip fracture. METHODS Patients aged 45 years or older who, during weekday, daytime working hours, received a diagnosis of a hip fracture requiring surgery were randomly assigned to receive accelerated or standard care. Our feasibility outcomes included the proportion of eligible patients randomly assigned, completeness of follow-up and timelines of accelerated surgery. The main clinical outcome, assessed by data collectors and adjudicators who were unaware of study group allocations, was a major perioperative complication (i.e., a composite of death, preoperative myocardial infarction, myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, stroke, and life-threatening or major bleeding) within 30 days of randomization. RESULTS Of patients eligible for inclusion, 80% consented and were randomly assigned to groups (30 to accelerated care and 30 to standard care) at 2 centres in Canada and 1 centre in India. All patients completed 30-day follow-up. The median time from diagnosis to surgery was 6.0 hours in the accelerated care group and 24.2 hours in the standard care group (p < 0.001). A major perioperative complication occurred in 9 (30%) of the patients in the accelerated care group and 14 (47%) of the patients in the standard care group (hazard ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.26-1.39).

To assess the conformational changes during the reaction cycle, we studied the structure of different PMCA states using a fluorescent probe, hydrophobic photolabeling, controlled proteolysis and Ca2+-ATPase activity. Our results show that calmodulin binds to E2P-like states, and during dephosphorylation, the hydrophobicity in the nucleotide-binding pocket decreases and the Ca2+ binding site becomes inaccessible to the extracellular medium. Autoinhibitory interactions are disrupted in E1Ca and in the E2P ground state whereas they are stabilized in the E2∙Pi product state.

83947,83947,83947,[Not Available].,13.286156,9.265002,2016,"BACKGROUND Deaths attributable to psychostimulants with abuse potential have increased in the United States (US) in recent years. Methamphetamine use, in particular, has risen sharply. We evaluated the correlation between amphetamine- and methamphetamine-related case exposures reported to the Michigan Poison Center (MiPC) coinciding with psychostimulant age-adjusted mortality rates from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS). METHODS We compared amphetamine and methamphetamine exposures reported to the MiPC from 2012 to 2018, queried from ToxSentry® database, to MDHHS reports on resident death certificates with attributed death due to ""overdose, regardless of intent"" and related cause of death attributed to psychostimulants with abuse potential. Linear regression assessed goodness-of-fit. Slope with standard error and adjusted R2 were reported. Psychostimulants included methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), dextroamphetamine, levoamphetamine, and methylphenidate. RESULTS Psychostimulant deaths reported by MDHHS increased from 17 to 165 between 2012 and 2018. The average age-adjusted rate of psychostimulant-involved overdose deaths per 100,000 state residents rose from 0.2 to 1.8. Linear regression of MiPC amphetamine exposure rates with state health department-reported age-adjusted psychostimulant mortality rates yielded a slope of 1.93, SE 0.5, p value 0.035, and adjusted R2 0.55. Linear regression of MiPC methamphetamine exposure rates with state health department-reported age-adjusted psychostimulant mortality rates yielded a slope of 0.78, SE 0.27, p value 0.012, and adjusted R2 0.70 suggesting a strong correlation. CONCLUSION Psychostimulant use and associated deaths in the US are increasing, representing an evolving public health threat. Michigan demonstrates consistency with national trends and data from the MiPC correlates strongly with state-reported age-adjusted psychostimulant mortality rates. Strengthening collaboration between poison centers and state health departments is critical for detection and mitigation efforts and can thereby inform resource allocation.","Vohra, Varun; King, Andrew; Daviskiba, Sydney; Reed, Brian; Rockhill, Sarah; Kern, Perri; Dean, Diana",Clinical toxicology,86,5

Based on both quantitative and qualitative data collected in China's Hubei province (i.e. the first epicentre of COVID-19), this research explores how the pandemic influences the practices of e-health from the perspective of users. Through analysis of 1,033 surveys and 14 in-depth interviews, we find that e-health has played a crucial role in residents' healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain external factors influence the choice of digital health, including the high risk of infection outdoors, the shutting down of transport systems, and dysfunctional healthcare facilities that neglect non-COVID-19 patients' clinical demands. Against this backdrop, we argue digital health acts as a functional equivalent to traditional medical treatment and has largely satisfied patients and users in the crisis period. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has unintentionally sped up the diffusion of digital medicine over the long term as respondents expressed their willingness to continue use of e-health in the post-COVID-19 phase. However, we assert that despite the increasing use of e-health, it cannot fully substitute traditional offline treatment. Thus, we suggest a combination of online and offline healthcare will be more commonly practiced in the future.","Wang, Weiquan; Sun, Li; Liu, Tao; Lai, Tian",Health sociology review : the journal of the Health Section of the Australian Sociological Association,86,31

Their association with pregnancy increases the risk of rupture resulting in a disproportionately high maternal and fetal mortality. Accordingly, elective surgical treatment is recommended in asymptomatic patients with aneurysms less than 2 cm. In this case, we present a patient during her third trimester of pregnancy with a SAA who was treated by laparoscopic aneurysm resection and splenectomy. METHODS The patient is a 38-year-old multiparous woman, with an incidental diagnosis of a SAA in 2010. Subsequently, the patient became pregnant and at 27 weeks started to develop abdominal pain. Failed embolization was attempted with worsening of the patient's symptoms. A CT angiogram revealed a 1.6 cm distal third SAA without any evidence of rupture. Due to the localization of the lesion, the patient was offered a laparoscopic aneurysm resection and splenectomy. RESULTS Operating time was 90 min and estimated blood loss was 5 cc. Postoperative fetal monitoring was normal. No perioperative complications were observed. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3. Two months after laparoscopic splenectomy, the patient delivered a male infant in perfect health. CONCLUSIONS Although this is a rare disease, the risk of aneurysmal rupture is increased during pregnancy. As a result of high maternal and fetal mortality, elective surgery should be performed.

With no treatment available, studies of the immune response to TBEV are essential for the understanding of the immunopathogenesis of tick-borne encephalitis and for the development of therapeutics. We have previously demonstrated that CD8+ T cell responses in peripheral blood in patients with acute TBEV peak at around 7 d after hospitalization in the neuroinvasive phase of the disease. In this study, we identified six novel TBEV HLA-A2- and HLA-B7-restricted epitopes, all derived from the nonstructural proteins of TBEV. This identification allowed for a comprehensive phenotypic and temporal analysis of the HLA-A2- and HLA-B7-restricted Ag-specific CD8+ T cell response during the acute stages of human TBEV infection. HLA-A2- and HLA-B7-restricted TBEV epitope-specific effector cells predominantly displayed a CD45RA-CCR7-CD27+CD57- phenotype at day 7, which transitioned into separate distinct phenotypes for HLA-A2- and HLA-B7-restricted TBEV-specific CD8+ T cells, respectively. At day 21, the most prevalent phenotype in the HLA-A2-restricted CD8+ T cell populations was CD45RA-CCR7-CD27+CD57+, whereas the HLA-B7-restricted CD8+ T cell population was predominantly CD45RA+CCR7-CD27+CD57+ Almost all TBEV epitope-specific CD8+ T cells expressed α4 and β1 integrins at days 7 and 21, whereas the bulk CD8+ T cells expressed lower integrin levels. Taken together, human TBEV infection elicits broad responses to multiple epitopes, predominantly derived from the nonstructural part of the virus, establishing distinct maturation patterns for HLA-A2- and HLA-B7-restricted TBEV epitope-specific CD8+ T cells.","Lampen, Margit H; Uchtenhagen, Hannes; Blom, Kim; Varnaitė, Renata; Pakalniene, Jolita; Dailidyte, Laura; Wälchli, Sébastien; Lindquist, Lars; Mickiene, Aukse; Michaëlsson, Jakob; Schumacher, Ton N; Ljunggren, Hans-Gustaf; Sandberg, Johan K; Achour, Adnane; Gredmark-Russ, Sara",ImmunoHorizons,86,28

The goal of this study was to provide further insights into the relationship between pregnancy and DLGG. METHODS A total of 12 patients were selected from a shared database of DLGGs, according to the following inclusion criteria: DLGG diagnosis in post-partum, DLGG recurrence after pregnancy in patients previously operated for DLGG. The extent of surgical resection (EOR) at first surgery were evaluated. All cases were assessed based on the 2016 WHO classification. The tumor growing patter, expresses by preoperative ΔT2T1 MRI index was evaluated. RESULTS In four cases newly diagnosed DLGG were detected patients in post-partum. Seven women, previously operated for DLGG, experienced pregnancy during the natural history of glioma, and were affected by tumor recurrence after pregnancy. One singular had an incidental LGG not surgically treated, who presented an important tumor growth after pregnancy. Radiological and surgical data were discussed according to literature. CONCLUSIONS Pregnancy does not seem to have an impact on the survival of women with DLGG. The potential role of pregnancy as risk factor in tumor recurrence is described, however, not proven. In this regard, the association between pregnancy and Tumor recurrence is extremely doubtful, and currently attributable to the simple coincidence. Further multicenter molecular investigations are required to better understand the mechanisms by which the pregnancy, in patients with a pervious surgery for DLGG, may influence tumor regrowth in comparison with the natural history of the disease.","Somma, Teresa; Baiano, Cinzia; Santi, Laura; Sabatino, Giovanni; Della Pepa, Giuseppe Maria; La Rocca, Giuseppe; Cappabianca, Paolo; Olivi, Alessandro; Skrap, Miran; Ius, Tamara",Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,86,9

MATERIALS AND METHODS This was secondary analysis of Public Data basis on 25 Dec 2020. Statistics included descriptive statistics, analysis of contingency tables, which assessed the value of χ 2, the achieved significance level (p). RESULTS During the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 8485 cases of COVID-19 were registered in pregnant women in the Far Eastern Federal District and the Siberian Federal District, accounting for 5.9% of registered pregnant women and 1.71% of the total affected population. The morbidity rate in pregnant women was 3.02 times higher than in the general population: 5933.2 vs 1960.8 per 100 thousand population. 27.4% of mothers had asymptomatic disease; 52.7% - mild; 16.6% - moderate, 2.5% - severe, 0.5% - critical disease. The incidence of hospitalization in ICU of pregnant women was higher relative to the general population (3.57% vs 2.24%, p < .001), but the frequency of mechanical ventilation was lower (0.48% vs 1.05%, p < .001). Preterm delivery had 18.3% (p < .001 CS - 42.0%. The mortality rate in pregnant women was 0.14% vs 1.95% - in the general population (p < .001). Perinatal mortality was 37 cases (1.56%), of which there were 31 stillbirths (1.26%), and 6 (0.25%) cases of early neonatal mortality. 148 (6.2%) COVID-19(+) newborns were identified, despite anti-epidemic measures. CONCLUSION The incidence of COVID-19 in pregnant women in Siberia and the Far East is higher than in the general population, but the disease is characterized by a milder.

We report our initial experience with robotic-assisted radical anterior pelvic exenteration in females in an attempt to evaluate the technique's feasibility and outcomes. A retrospective review of our bladder cancer database was performed. Twelve women that underwent robotic-assisted radical anterior pelvic exenteration, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy, and urinary diversion for clinically localized urothelial carcinoma of the bladder between 2004 and 2008 were included in this retrospective study. Median age was 73.0 +/- 9.6 years and median body mass index (BMI) was 23.5 +/- 5.0 kg/m2. Ten patients underwent ileal conduit diversion, one had an orthotopic neobladder and one an Indiana pouch. Median total operating time was 6.4 +/- 1.5 hours with median console and diversion times of 4.7 +/- 0.9 and 2.5 +/- 1.5 hours respectively. Median blood loss was 275.0 +/- 165.8 ml. Median length of stay was 8.0 +/- 1.6 days. Four patients were T2N0 or less, five T3N0, one T3N1 and two patients T4N0. There was one patient with positive surgical margins. Median number of lymph nodes removed was 23.0 +/- 11.4. Median follow-up of 9.0 +/- 6.0 months was available for ten patients. One had a recurrent ureteroenteric stricture, one had colpocleisis for vault prolapse, and three had metastatic disease. Robotic-assisted laparoscopic anterior pelvic exenteration appears to be a favorable surgical option with acceptable operative, pathological, and short-term clinical outcomes.

Several risk factors are associated with vulvodynia from history of yeast infections to depression and allergies. Recent work suggests an altered immune inflammatory mechanism plays a role in vulvodynia pathophysiology. As the vaginal microbiome plays an important role in local immune-inflammatory responses, we evaluated the vaginal microbiome among women with vulvodynia compared to controls as one component of the immune system. OBJECTIVE Characterize the vaginal microbiome in women with clinically-confirmed vulvodynia and age-matched controls and assess its overall association with vulvodynia, and how it may serve to modify other factors that are associated with vulvodynia as well. STUDY Design: We conducted a case-control study of 234 Minneapolis/Saint Paul area women with clinically-confirmed vulvodynia and 234 age-matched controls clinically confirmed with no history of vulvar pain. All participants provided vulvovaginal swab samples for culture-based and non-culture (sequencing) based microbiological assessments; background and medical history questionnaires on demographic characteristics, sexual and reproductive history, and history of psychosocial factors. Vaginal microbiome diversity was assessed using the Shannon Alpha Diversity Index. Data were analyzed using logistic regression. RESULTS Culture and molecular-based analyses of the vaginal microbiome showed few differences between cases and controls. However, among women with alpha diversity below the median (low), there was a strong association between increasing numbers of yeast infections and vulvodynia onset, relative to comparable time periods among controls (age-adjusted odds ratio [OR] 8.1, 95% CI: 2.9-22.7 in those with 5 or more yeast infections). Also among women with low diversity microbiomes, we observed a strong association between moderate-to-severe childhood abuse, antecedent anxiety, depression, and high levels of rumination and vulvodynia with ORs from 1.83 to 2.81. These associations were not observed in women with high diversity microbiomes. CONCLUSIONS Although there were no overall differences in microbiome profiles between cases and controls, vaginal microbiome diversity influenced associations between environmental and psychosocial risk factors and vulvodynia. However, it is unclear whether vaginal diversity modifies the association between the risk factors and vulvodynia or is altered as a consequence of the associations.","Bedford, Lisa; Parker, Samantha E; Davis, Elyse; Salzman, Elizabeth; Hillier, Sharon L; Foxman, Betsy; Harlow, Bernard L",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,86,16

The coronavirus 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) enzyme is essential for proteolytic maturation of the virus. This research was based on immunoinformatics and structural vaccinology strategies. The design of the multi epitope vaccine was built using HTLs and CTLs epitopes from 3CL hydrolase protein along with adjuvant to enhance immune response; these are joined to each other by short peptide linkers. The vaccine also carries potential B-cell linear epitope regions, B-cell discontinuous epitopes, and Interferon-γ inducing epitopes. Epitopes of the constructed multi epitope vaccine was found to be antigenic, nonallergic, nontoxic, and cover large human population worldwide. The vaccine construct was modeled, validated and refined by different programs to achieve high-quality 3D structure. The resulting high-quality model was applied for conformational B cell epitope selection and docking analyses with toll-like receptor-3 for understanding the capability of vaccine to elicit an immune response. Insilico cloning and Codon adaptation were also performed into the pET-19b plasmid vector.

Eye movements of 41 children (21 amblyopes and 20 controls) were compared to eye movements of 55 adults (18 amblyopes and 37 controls). Participants were asked to pursue a target moving at a constant velocity. The target was either a 'standard' target, with a uniform color intensity, or a 'noisy' target, with blurry edges, to mimic the blurriness of an amblyopic eye. Analysis of pursuit patterns showed that the onset was delayed, and the gain was decreased in control children with a noisy target in comparison to amblyopic or control children with a standard target. Furthermore, a significant effect of prior and visual information on pursuit velocity and saccades was found across all participants. Moreover, the modulation of the effect of visual information on the pursuit velocity by group, that is amblyopes or controls with a standard target, and controls with a noisy target, was more limited in children. In other words, the effect of visual information was higher in control adults with a standard target compared to control children with the same target. However, in the case of a blurry target, either in control participants with a noisy target or in amblyopic participants with a standard target, the effect of visual information was larger in children.","Hemptinne, Coralie; Deravet, Nicolas; Orban de Xivry, Jean-Jacques; Lefèvre, Philippe; Yüksel, Demet",Journal of computational neuroscience,86,1

In order for pig production to become less of a threat to the environment, excreta must contain as little P as possible or be efficiently used by plants. This must be achieved without decreasing the livestock performance. Phosphorus and calcium (Ca) deposition in the bones of growing pigs must be optimised without affecting the muscle gain. This requires precision feeding based on cutting-edge techniques of diet formulation throughout the animal growth phase. Modelling and data mining have become important tools in this quest. In this study, a mechanistic model taking into account the distribution of P between bone and soft tissues was compared to the established factorial models (INRA (Jondreville and Dourmad, 2005) and NRC (National Research Council, 2012)) that predict P (apparent total tract digestible, ATTD-P; or standardised total tract digestible, STTD-P) and Ca (total and STTD) requirements as a function of BW and protein deposition. The requirements for different bone mineralisation scenarios, namely, 100% and 85% of the genetic potential, were compared with these two models. Sobol indices were used to estimate the relative impact of growth-related parameters on mineral requirements at 30, 60 and 120 kg of BW. The INRA showed the highest value of ATTD-P requirement between 29 and 103 kg of BW (6%) and lower for lighter and higher BW. Similarly, the model for 85% bone mineralisation showed lower STTD-P requirement than NRC between 29 and 93 kg of BW (7%) and higher for lighter and higher BW. Contrary to other models, the Ca requirement of the proposed model is not fixed in relation to P. It increases from 95 kg of BW while the others decrease. The INRA showed the highest Ca requirements. The model Ca requirements for 100% bone mineralisation are higher than NRC from 20 to 38 kg of BW similar until 70 kg of BW and then higher again. For 85% objective, the model showed lower Ca requirements from 25 to 82 kg of BW and higher for lighter and higher BW. The potential Ca deposition in bones is the most sensitive parameter (84% to 100% of the variance) of both ATTD-P and Ca at 30, 60 and 120 kg. The second most sensitive parameter is the protein deposition, explaining 1% to 15% of the ATTD-P variance.

METHODS A systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and gray literature from inception through January 31, 2020, was performed. Original articles with > 10 patients evaluating the accuracy of DECT for detecting BME in the appendicular skeleton with a reference standard of MRI and/or clinical follow-up were included. Study details were independently extracted by two reviewers. Meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random-effects model with multivariable meta-regression. Risk of bias (RoB) was evaluated with QUADAS-2. RESULTS Twenty studies evaluating 790 patients for BME in the appendicular skeleton were included in analysis. The summary sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values for BME in the appendicular skeleton were 86% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82-89%), 93% (95% CI 90-95%), and 0.95, respectively. Quantitative analysis had a higher sensitivity than qualitative analysis on meta-regression (p = 0.01), but no difference in specificity (p = 0.28). No other covariates contributed to variability in accuracy (etiology (trauma vs non-trauma); location (upper vs lower extremity); and RoB). Studies demonstrated generally low or unclear RoB and applicability. Eight studies included index tests with high RoB when quantitative assessments used a retrospective cut-off value. CONCLUSIONS DECT demonstrates a higher specificity than sensitivity and AUC > 0.9. In scenarios where MRI availability is limited or contraindicated, DECT could be an alternative to MRI for detecting BME in the appendicular skeleton. However, limitations in sources of variability and RoB warrant continued study.

Cardiac complications can occur in patients with COVID-19 and can be fatal in severe cases. Recently, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2 used the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cellular receptor to gain entry into the host cell. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect heart tissues and the potential mechanism of cardiac injury in COVID-19 have not been determined. Methods To investigate the expression of ACE2 in heart tissues, we performed a bioinformatic analysis from public databases involving mRNA and protein expression. The correlation between ACE2 expression and virus-related genes was analyzed using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database. Gene ontology (GO) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses were performed to explore the roles of ACE2. Results ACE2 expression in the heart was significantly higher than that in the lung. Compared with the other coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the mRNA and protein expression of ACE2 was increased in the heart. Moreover, the mRNA expression of ACE2 was substantially upregulated in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Importantly, the expression of ACE2 was positively correlated with genes that regulate viral reproduction and transmission. The GO and PPI analyses showed that the functions of proteins interacting with ACE2 were significantly enriched in the regulation of the viral process and inflammatory response. Conclusions Our study provided bioinformatics evidence that the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 in the heart could contribute to COVID-19-mediated myocardial damage via the virus-induced cytopathic effect, triggering a cardiac inflammatory storm. Therefore, the close monitoring of cardiac function and early clinical intervention may be pivotal to preventing cardiac injury-related mortality in patients with COVID-19.","Wang, Weiqi; Lv, Silin; Gan, Wenqiang; Zeng, Zifan; Yang, Min",Annals of translational medicine,86,11

METHODS We conducted a retrospective, nested, case-control study of children with SCD <18 years who had respiratory viral panels (RVPs) performed at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta from 2012 to 2019. We abstracted the medical records to describe the demographics, clinical features, and outcomes of children who tested positive for RSV (cases) versus children who tested negative (controls). We calculated the annual incidence of RSV and related hospitalization rates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and used multivariate logistic regression to evaluate associations. RESULTS We identified 3676 RVP tests performed on 2636 patients over seven respiratory seasons resulting in 219/3676 (6.0%) RSV-positive tests among 160/2636 (6.1%) patients. The average annual incidence of laboratory-confirmed RSV infection among children with SCD was 34.3 (95% CI 18.7-49.8) and 3.8 (95% CI 0.5-7.0) cases per 1000 person-years for those <5 years and 5-18 years, respectively. The RSV-related hospitalization rate for children <5 years was 20.7 (95% CI 8.5-32.8) per 1000 person-years. RSV-positive cases were significantly younger than RSV-negative patients (3.8 years vs 7.6 years, P < .001). Of RSV-positive cases, 22 (13.8%) developed acute chest syndrome and nine (5.6%) required intensive care, which was not significantly different from RSV-negative children with SCD. CONCLUSION RSV infections are common in children with SCD with higher burden in younger patients. RSV is associated with considerable morbidity, including higher rates of hospitalization compared to the general population.","Rostad, Christina A; Maillis, Alexander N; Lai, Kristina; Bakshi, Nitya; Jerris, Robert C; Lane, Peter A; Yee, Marianne E; Yildirim, Inci",Pediatric blood & cancer,86,8

This team would engage acutely and for a longer term after TBI to provide accurate diagnoses, which guides subsequent management and rehabilitation. This approach would also encourage more efficient collaboration between research and the clinic. We propose that the current major trauma network is leveraged to introduce and evaluate this proposal. Improvements to patient outcomes through this approach would lead to reduced personal, societal and economic impact of TBI.","Li, Lucia M; Dilley, Michael D; Carson, Alan; Twelftree, Jaq; Hutchinson, Peter J; Belli, Antonio; Betteridge, Shai; Cooper, Paul N; Griffin, Colette M; Jenkins, Peter O; Liu, Clarence; Sharp, David J; Sylvester, Richard; Wilson, Mark H; Turner, Martha S; Greenwood, Richard",Clinical medicine,86,29

The share of SRF in the fuel mixture was 10%. During the co-combustion of SRF, no technological disturbances of the boiler were noted. The obtained SO2 and NOX emissions were comparable with coal combustion, but dust emissions increased. During the co-combustion of the coal mixture with 10% of alternative fuel, acceptable standards for co-incineration of waste were exceeded for the following: NOx, dust, CO, HCl, HF, heavy metals, dioxins, and furans. The by-products of waste co-combustion with coal were non-hazardous waste. The obtained results constitute a very important contribution to the process of boiler retrofitting towards a waste co-incineration unit, and to meeting the legislative and environmental requirements.","Wasielewski, Ryszard; Głód, Krzysztof; Lasek, Janusz",Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association,86,27

One of their most controversial and puzzling features is their distinctive caudal anatomy, which has been suggested as a mechanism to facilitate caudal autotomy. Several researchers have described putative fracture planes in mesosaur caudal vertebrae - unossified regions in the middle of caudal vertebral centra - that in many extant squamates allow the tail to separate and the animal to escape predation. However, the reports of fracture planes in mesosaurs have never been closely investigated beyond preliminary descriptions, which has prompted scepticism. Here, using numerous vertebral series, histology, and X-ray computed tomography, we provide a detailed account of fracture planes in all three species of mesosaurs. Given the importance of the tail for propulsion in many other aquatic reptiles, the identification of fracture planes in mesosaurs has important implications for their aquatic locomotion. Despite mesosaurs apparently having the ability to autotomize their tail, it is unlikely that they actually made use of this behaviour due to a lack of predation pressure and no record of autotomized tails in articulated specimens. We suggest that the presence of fracture planes in mesosaurs is an evolutionary relic and could represent a synapomorphy for an as-yet undetermined terrestrial clade of Palaeozoic amniotes that includes the earliest radiation of secondarily aquatic tetrapods.","MacDougall, Mark J; Verrière, Antoine; Wintrich, Tanja; LeBlanc, Aaron R H; Fernandez, Vincent; Fröbisch, Jörg",Scientific reports,86,19

Primary AI (PAI) is rare and is caused by direct adrenal failure. Secondary AI (SAI) is more frequent and is caused by diseases affecting the pituitary, whereas in tertiary AI (TAI), the hypothalamus is affected. The most prevalent form is TAI owing to exogenous glucocorticoid use. Symptoms of AI are non-specific, often overlooked or misdiagnosed, and are related to the lack of cortisol, adrenal androgen precursors and aldosterone (especially in PAI). Diagnosis is based on measurement of the adrenal corticosteroid hormones, their regulatory peptide hormones and stimulation tests. The goal of therapy is to establish a hormone replacement regimen that closely mimics the physiological diurnal cortisol secretion pattern, tailored to the patient's daily needs. This Primer provides insights into the epidemiology, mechanisms and management of AI during pregnancy as well as challenges of long-term management. In addition, the importance of identifying life-threatening adrenal emergencies (acute AI and adrenal crisis) is highlighted and strategies for prevention, which include patient education, glucocorticoid emergency cards and injection kits, are described.","Hahner, Stefanie; Ross, Richard J; Arlt, Wiebke; Bancos, Irina; Burger-Stritt, Stephanie; Torpy, David J; Husebye, Eystein S; Quinkler, Marcus",Nature reviews.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Mesh fixation method may influence on the incidence of chronic pain after Lichtenstein hernioplasty. METHODS Lichtenstein hernioplasty was performed under local anesthesia in 625 patients as day-case surgery in 8 Finnish hospitals. The patients were randomized to receive either a cyanoacrylate glue (Histoacryl, n = 216), self-gripping mesh (Parietex ProGrip, n = 202), or conventional nonabsorbable sutures (Prolene 2-0, n = 207) for mesh fixation. The incidence of wound complications, pain, recurrences, and patients discomfort was recorded on days 1, 7, 30, and 1 year after surgery. The primary endpoint was the sensation of pain measured by pain scores and the need of analgesics after 1 year of surgery. RESULTS The type and size of inguinal hernias were similar in the 3 study groups. The duration of operation was 34 ± 13, 32 ± 9, and 38 ± 9 minutes in the glue, self-gripping, and suture groups, respectively (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences postoperatively in pain response or need for analgesics between the study groups. Two superficial infections (0.3%), 31 wound seromas (5.0%), and 4 recurrent hernias (0.6%) were recorded during a 1-year follow-up. Some 25 patients (4.2%) needed occasionally analgesics for chronic groin pain. A feeling of a foreign object and quality of life were similar in all study groups. CONCLUSIONS This randomized trial failed to prove that mesh fixation without sutures causes less inguinodynia than suture fixation in Lichtenstein hernioplasty. Mesh fixation without sutures is feasible without compromising postoperative outcome.","Rönkä, Kirsi; Vironen, Jaana; Kössi, Jyrki; Hulmi, Tanja; Silvasti, Seppo; Hakala, Tapio; Ilves, Imre; Song, Indrek; Hertsi, Merja; Juvonen, Petri; Paajanen, Hannu",Annals of surgery,86,31

There is currently no way to develop and test innovations for abdominal wall surgery that is cheap, repeatable and easy to use. In hernia repair, the required mesh overlap relative to defect size is not established. The aims of this study were to develop a biomechanical model of the abdominal wall based on in vivo pressure measurements, and to apply this to study mesh overlap in hernia repair. METHODS An observational study of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) levels throughout abdominal surgery was conducted to identify the peak perioperative IAP in vivo. This was then applied in the development of a surrogate abdominal wall model. An in vitro study of mesh overlap for various defect sizes was then conducted using this clinically relevant surrogate abdomen model. RESULTS The mean peak perioperative IAP recorded in the clinical study was 1740 Pa, and occurred during awakening from anaesthesia. This was reproduced in the surrogate abdomen model, which was also able to replicate incisional hernia formation. Using this model, the mesh overlap necessary to prevent hernia formation up to 20 kPa was found, independent of anatomical variations, to be 2 × (defect diameter) + 25 mm. CONCLUSION This study demonstrated that a surgically relevant surrogate abdominal wall model is a useful translational tool in the study of hernia repair. Surgical relevance This study examined the mesh overlap requirements for hernia repair, evaluated in a biomechanical model of the abdomen. Currently, mesh size is selected based on empirical evidence and may underpredict the requirement for large meshes. The study proposes a relationship between the defect size and mesh size to select the appropriate mesh size. Following further trials and investigations, this could be used in clinical practice to reduce the incidence of hernia recurrence.","Lyons, M; Mohan, H; Winter, D C; Simms, C K",The British journal of surgery,86,16

However, this relationship is complex, as self-efficacy is thought to influence and be influenced by physical activity. The directionality of the self-regulatory efficacy (SRE) and physical activity relationship was examined using a cross-lagged design. A secondary purpose was to examine these relationships across differing weather conditions. METHODS Canadian adolescents (N = 337; aged between 13 and 18 years) completed the physical activity and SRE measures 4 times during a school year. Structural equation modeling was used to perform a cross-lag analysis. RESULTS The relationships between physical activity and SRE appeared to be weather dependent. During a more challenging weather period (eg, cold weather), the relationship between physical activity and SRE was bidirectional. However, no relationship emerged when the 2 constructs were assessed during a more optimal weather period (eg, warm weather). CONCLUSIONS Some support has been provided for the bidirectional nature of the relationship between physical activity and SRE. The relationship appeared to be qualified by climate considerations, suggesting that future research examine how weather may relate not just to physical activity but also to the correlates of physical activity.","Wilson, Kathleen S; Spink, Kevin S",Pediatric exercise science,86,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS In a prospective, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial, we studied 64 patients undergoing elective thyroid lobectomy between July 2013 and February 2014. Acoustic analyses were performed preoperatively and at 48 h and 2 weeks postoperatively. The voice handicap index (VHI), M.D. Anderson dysphagia index (MDADI), and laryngopharyngeal symptom score (LPS) were determined preoperatively and at 24 h, 48 h, 1 week, and 2 weeks post-thyroidectomy. RESULTS In acoustic analysis, jitter, shimmer and noise-to-harmonic ratio showed significantly better results in the LMA group than the ETI group 48 h after surgery, but there was no difference at 2 weeks. The incidence of postoperative lower-pitched voice in the LMA group was also significantly lower than that in the ETI group. In the LMA group, the VHI, MDADI, and LPS were better compared to those in the ETI group at 24 h postoperatively, and improved to the preoperative state within 1 week. However, those in the ETI group remained poorer than the preoperative values 1 week after surgery. CONCLUSIONS Use of the LMA in general anesthesia for thyroid surgery has advantages over the ETI in decreasing patients' subjective and objective voice symptoms, reducing the duration of symptoms, and relieving the laryngopharyngeal symptoms.","Chun, Byung-Joon; Bae, Ja-Sung; Lee, So-Hui; Joo, Jin; Kim, Eun-Sung; Sun, Dong-Il",World journal of surgery,86,1

Dysplasia is often distributed throughout the anal mucosa, and focal ablative techniques have high rates of recurrence. METHODS With the goal of eradicating dysplasia from the entire anal mucosa, we conducted a phase I dose-ranging study to determine the safety and tolerability of radiofrequency ablation (RFA). HIV-infected individuals with high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia underwent RFA of the anal mucosa. Patient-reported procedural and postprocedural symptoms were recorded, and mucosal healing was visually assessed. RESULTS Four groups of 3 subjects each were treated with incrementally increasing numbers of RF pulses (1-3) applied to a single area of anal mucosa. Two or three doses of 12 J/cm2 were found to have acceptable patient tolerance and healing of the mucosa within 4 weeks of ablation. Using these doses, 2 groups underwent ablation of 180° of contiguous mucosa. Subjects experienced a loss of 1 to 3 days of daily activities of living, 7 to 14 days of postprocedure symptoms, and mucosal healing within 4 weeks. One subject in the first treatment group had the procedure aborted due to severe procedural pain. CONCLUSIONS The study provides evidence of the safety and tolerability of anal RFA of 180° of contiguous mucosa in a single procedure and will allow future RFA efficacy studies in the treatment of anal dysplasia.","Smulian, A George; Moore, Diana M; Robertson, Jaime C; Kralovic, Stephen M",HIV clinical trials,86,12

The purpose of this study was to document the magnitude of that effect by examining (a) the amount of psychologists' telepsychology use before the COVID-19 pandemic, during the pandemic, and anticipated use after the pandemic; as well as (b) the demographic, training, policy, and clinical practice predictors of these changes. This study used a cross-sectional, national online design to recruit 2,619 licensed psychologists practicing in the United States. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists performed 7.07% of their clinical work with telepsychology, which increased 12-fold to 85.53% during the pandemic, with 67.32% of psychologists conducting all of their clinical work with telepsychology. Psychologists projected that they would perform 34.96% of their clinical work via telepsychology after the pandemic. Psychologists working in outpatient treatment facilities reported over a 26-fold increase in telepsychology use during the pandemic, while those in Veterans Affairs medical centers only reported a sevenfold increase. A larger increase in percentage telepsychology use occurred in women, in psychologists who reported an increase in telepsychology training and supportive organizational telepsychology policies, and in psychologists who treated relationship issues, anxiety, and women's issues. The lowest increases in percentage telepsychology use were reported by psychologists working in rural areas, treating antisocial personality disorder, performing testing and evaluation, and treating rehabilitation populations. Although there was a remarkable increase in telepsychology use during the COVID-19 pandemic, individual and practice characteristics affected psychologists' ability to adopt telepsychology.

Under real conditions there are still unknowns that limit this application including the influence of suspended solids and natural organic matter. This work aims to investigate the influence of two key parameters, suspended solids and natural organic matter, on the efficiency of UVC disinfection of surface water to achieve the drinking water quality requirements established by the WHO for point of use (POU) technologies. Kaolinite (turbidity agent) and humic acids (HA, model of organic matter) were used in a factorial design of experiments (Turbidity from 0 to 5 NTU, and HA from 0 to 3.5 mg/L) to investigate their effect on UVC inactivation of MS2 phage in surface water. A collimated beam (12 W) and a commercial UVC disinfection flow system (16 W) designed to provide drinking water at households were used. The UVC flow system both in the laboratory and in the field was able to achieve the reduction requirements established by WHO (LRV >3.5 for all tested conditions), confirming the good performance of the studied UVC disinfection system. The results found in the lab were used to establish a numerical model that predicts the disinfection rate constant as a function of water turbidity and transmittance at 254 nm (confidence level>95%). The model permitted to elucidate the critical effect of low concentrations of HA in reducing the inactivation rate by 40% for 3.5 mg/L-HA compared with 0, the non-significant detrimental effect of turbidity lower than 5 NTU, and the lack of synergistic effects between both parameters at these levels. The UVC flow system was also tested in the field, in Tzabalho, Chiapas (Mexico), and Antioquia (Colombia), with spiked MS2 into natural surface water. This investigation opens a potential application to monitor the performance of UVC systems with surface water by monitoring transmittance at 254 nm as a tool to control UVC domestic systems to deliver safe drinking water in a household without the need of expensive and laborious biological monitoring tools.","Baldasso, Veronica; Lubarsky, Helen; Pichel, Natalia; Turolla, Andrea; Antonelli, Manuela; Hincapie, Margarita; Botero, Liliana; Reygadas, Fermin; Galdos-Balzategui, Ane; Byrne, J A; Fernandez-Ibañez, Pilar",Water research,86,23

Reconstruction of the lateral canthus is important in the rehabilitation of the aging eyelid and an unfortunate necessity after failed lateral canthal surgery.

Many techniques have been described for the reconstruction of the lateral canthus in functional conditions or for aesthetic purposes. These methods have met with varying success. In this article, we begin with a discussion of the anatomy and physiology of the lateral canthus, followed by clinical examples of lateral canthal abnormalities and underlying pathophysiologies. A review of surgical options for the lateral canthus is presented with concluding remarks on postoperative complications.","Chong, Kelvin Kam-Lung; Goldberg, Robert A",Facial plastic surgery : FPS,86,1

As the medical community seeks to ensure evidence-based management of clinical interventions, we conducted a systematic review with the goal of providing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines to answer questions surrounding the use of simple oxygen therapy to improve oxygenation including comparison of delivery devices, the efficacy of humidification, comparison of flows, and goals for hemoglobin oxygen saturation in children. Using a modification of the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method, four recommendations were developed to assist clinicians in the utilization of oxygen therapy in hospitalized children: (1) The use if an oxygen hood or tent in lieu of a low-flow oxygen device for consistent oxygen delivery is not recommended; (2) The use of HFNC is safe and more effective than low flow oxygen to treat infants with moderate to severe bronchiolitis; (3) The application of humidification with low flow oxygen delivery is not recommended; (4) Targeting hemoglobin oxygenation saturation of 90% -97% for infants and children suffering from bronchiolitis is recommended, however no specific target can be recommended for pediatric patients suffering from respiratory diseases outside of bronchiolitis and establishing a patient/disease oxygen therapy target upon admission is considered best practice.","Napolitano, Natalie; Berlinski, Ariel; Walsh, Brian K; Ginier, Emily; Strickland, Shawna L",Respiratory care,86,31

By combining elements of the history with examination, the goal is to identify patterns and an effective differential diagnosis for this group of patients to help lead to an accurate diagnosis. RECENT FINDINGS Studies over the past dozen years have changed the historical approach to patients with dizziness from one based primarily on how the patient describes the sensation of dizziness. This older approach can lead to misdiagnosis, so a preferred method puts greater emphasis on whether the dizziness is acute or chronic, episodic or continuous, or evoked by or brought on by an event or circumstance so that a pattern may be derived that better narrows the differential diagnosis and focused examination can further narrow to a cause or causes. SUMMARY Dizziness is a common symptom of many possible causes. This article will help clinicians navigate gathering the history and examination to formulate a working diagnosis in patients affected by dizziness.","Fife, Terry D",Continuum,86,1

However, the prognosis and long-term outcome remains poor. METHODS AND RESULTS We investigated 309 patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) (186 ICM, 123 NICM; 271 males; mean age 64.1 ± 12 years; ejection fraction 34 ± 13%) after ≥1 VT ablations over a mean follow-up period of 34 ± 28 months. Electrical storm was the indication for 224 patients (73%), whereas 86 patients (28%) underwent epicardial as well as endocardial ablation. During follow-up, 132 patients (43%) experienced VT recurrence and 97 (31%) died. Ischaemic cardiomyopathy and NICM patients showed comparable results, regarding procedural endpoints, complications, VT recurrence and survival. The Cox-regression analysis for all-cause mortality revealed that the presence of higher left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV; P < 0.001), male gender (P = 0.018), atrial fibrillation (AF; P < 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; P = 0.001), antiarrhythmic drugs during the follow-up (P < 0.001), polymorphic VTs (P = 0.028), and periprocedural complications (P = 0.001) were independent predictors of mortality. CONCLUSION Ischaemic cardiomyopathy and NICM patients undergoing VT ablation had comparable results regarding procedural endpoints, complications, VT recurrence and 3-year mortality. Higher LVEDV, male gender, COPD, AF, polymorphic VTs, use of antiarrhythmics, and periprocedural complications are strong and independent predictors for increased mortality. The PAINESD score accurately predicted the long-term outcome in our cohort.","Darma, Angeliki; Bertagnolli, Livio; Dinov, Borislav; Torri, Federica; Shamloo, Alireza Sepehri; Lurz, Julia Anna; Dagres, Nikolaos; Husser-Bollmann, Daniela; Bollmann, Andreas; Hindricks, Gerhard; Arya, Arash","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",86,1

A correlation between treatment temperature and duration was established by an iterative process. Furthermore, chemical characterization of the resulting solid outputs (glass, cell, ribbons and residues) was performed in order to assess their further processing options. Additionally, the effect of removing the backsheet as a pre-treatment before the actual delamination process was investigated in relation to the aforementioned aspects of treatment duration and output quality. Results show that increased temperatures reduce the necessary treatment duration (65 minutes at 500°C, 33 minutes at 600°C) while generating the same output quality. The backsheet removal leads to an additional duration decrease of more than 45% at each considered temperature, while also having positive effects relating to fewer solid residues and easier flue gas handling. In regard to the main output specifications no significant influence of the pre-treatment is observed. Overall thermal delamination can be seen as a feasible method in order to obtain high value secondary raw materials from c-Si PV modules, while backsheet removal as pre-treatment should be considered as advantageous from multiple standpoints.","Dobra, Tudor; Vollprecht, Daniel; Pomberger, Roland","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",86,24

DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES This was a systematic review, prognostic accuracy analysis, and cost-effectiveness analysis. Databases searched were: Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and BioSis Previews. Grey literature was also explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic review was conducted to locate published and unpublished studies. All studies examining corneal button contamination and its association with endophthalmitis and keratitis posttransplantation were included. Extracted data were used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Cost data from the London Laboratory Services Group in London, ON were used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of culturing donor rim cultures. RESULTS Of 7,870 grafts, 954 had a positive rim culture (12.1%), with 12 patients going on to develop keratitis or endophthalmitis (1.3%). The prevalence of keratitis and endophthalmitis in this study was 0.15%, and the positive predictive value 1.5%. Of the 12 infections, nine were fungal and three bacterial. The estimated cost of a positive and negative test result was CAD$45.99 and $14.15, respectively. The cost to run all 7,870 tests was estimated to be $141,735.86, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $40,215.70. CONCLUSION There was a significant divergence between bacterial and fungal rim-culture results. Bacterial cultures predicted clinical infection poorly, did not change management, and were expensive. Fungal cultures predicted clinical infection in over 10% of patients, had the potential to change management, and were 40% less expensive than full rim culturing (bacterial and fungal tests). Fungal rim cultures may be considered in areas where fungal infection rates are high.","Kiatos, Efstathia; Armstrong, James J; Hutnik, Cindy Ml; Tsioros, Stephen M; Malvankar-Mehta, Monali S; Hodge, William G",ClinicoEconomics and outcomes research : CEOR,86,31

Although markers of inflammation, cardiac injury, and coagulopathy have been previously associated with mortality in the general population of patients with COVID-19, their prognostic impact amongst KTR with SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been specifically investigated. METHODS We conducted a cohort study of 49 KTR who presented with COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory risk factors for severe disease and mortality were prospectively collected and analyzed with respect to outcomes. The study participants were divided into 3 groups: 1) mild disease manageable in an outpatient setting (n = 8), 2) nonsevere disease requiring hospitalization (n = 21), and 3) severe disease (n = 20). RESULTS Gastrointestinal manifestations were common at diagnosis. The 30-day mortality rate in hospitalized patients was 19.5%. Early elevations of C-reactive protein (>100 mg/L) and interleukin-6 (>65 ng/L) followed by increases in high-sensitivity troponin I (>30 ng/L) and D-dimer (>960 ng/mL) were significantly associated with severe disease and mortality. Viral load did not have prognostic significance in our sample, suggesting that outcomes were chiefly driven by a cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

This has antifibrotic therapy implications. METHODS Twenty patients with suspected CPFE underwent late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI) and HRCT. Data from twelve healthy control subjects from a previous study who underwent thoracic LGE-MRI were included for comparison. Quantitative LGE signal intensity (SI) was retrospectively compared in regions of fibrosis and emphysema in CPFE patients to similar lung regions in controls. Qualitative comparisons for the presence/extent of reticulation, honeycombing, and traction bronchiectasis between LGE-MRI and HRCT were assessed by two readers in consensus. RESULTS There were significant quantitative differences in fibrosis SI compared to emphysema SI in CPFE patients (25.8, IQR 18.4-31.0 versus 5.3, IQR 5.0-8.1, p < 0.001). Significant differences were found between LGE-MRI and HRCT in the extent of reticulation (12.5, IQR 5.0-20.0 versus 25.0, IQR 15.0-26.3, p = 0.038) and honeycombing (5.0, IQR 0.0-10.0 versus 20.0, IQR 10.6-20.0, p = 0.001) but not traction bronchiectasis (10.0, IQR 5-15 versus 15.0, IQR 5-15, p = 0.878). Receiver operator curve analysis of fibrosis SI compared to similarly located regions in control subjects showed an area under the curve of 0.82 (p = 0.002). A SI cutoff of 19 yielded a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 86% in differentiating fibrosis from similarly located regions in control subjects.

To evaluate the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of both radionuclides, knowledge of the absorbed dose is essential. Thus, the authors present the dose calculations and discuss the results based on different models of the radionuclide distribution. Both different target volumes and the influence of the uptake kinetics were considered. METHODS Rat thyroid PC Cl3 cells in culture were incubated with either(99m)Tc or (123)I or were irradiated using 200 kV x-rays in the presence or absence of perchlorate. The clonogenic cell survival was measured via colony formation. In addition, the intracellular radionuclide uptake was quantified. Single-cell dose calculations were based on Monte Carlo simulations performed using Geant4. RESULTS Compared with external radiation using x-rays (D37 = 2.6 Gy), the radionuclides (99m)Tc (D37 = 3.5 Gy), and (123)I (D37 = 3.8 Gy) were less toxic in the presence of perchlorate. In the absence of perchlorate, the amount of activity a37 that was necessary to reduce the surviving fraction (SF) to 0.37 was 22.8 times lower for (99m)Tc and 12.4 times lower for (123)I because of the dose increase caused by intracellular radionuclide accumulation. When the cell nucleus was considered as the target for the dose calculation, the authors found a RBE of 2.18 for (99m)Tc and RBE = 3.43 for (123)I. Meanwhile, regarding the dose to the entire cell, RBE = 0.75 for (99m)Tc and RBE = 1.87 for (123)I. The dose to the entire cell was chosen as the dose criterion because of the intracellular radionuclide accumulation, which was found to occur solely in the cytoplasm. The calculated number of intracellular decays per cell was (975 ± 109) decays/MBq for (99m)Tc and (221 ± 82) decays/MBq for (123)I. CONCLUSIONS The authors' data indicate that extra-nuclear targets to Auger electrons exist, which is obvious from our dose calculations. When considering the dose to the cell nucleus, the authors found an enhanced RBE for(99m)Tc and (123)I relative to acute x-ray irradiation and pure extracellular irradiation with both radionuclides. Surprisingly, the authors did not find any radionuclide accumulation in the cell nucleus, indicating that there are additional radiosensitive targets besides the DNA. In addition, the authors demonstrated the necessity of cellular dose calculations in radiobiological experiments using unsealed radionuclides and identified the relevant parameters.","Freudenberg, R; Runge, R; Maucksch, U; Berger, V; Kotzerke, J",Medical physics,86,31

It has been reported the likelihood of adherence decreases as patients are prescribed more medications. Much medication adherence research to date is dominated by a single-disease focus, which is at odds with the rising prevalence of multimorbidity and may artificially underestimate the complexity of managing chronic illness. This review aims to describe the prevalence of medication non-adherence among patients with multimorbidity, and to identify potential predictors of non-adherence in this population. Methods: A systematic review will be conducted and reported according to PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO will be searched using a predefined search strategy from 2009-2019. Quantitative studies will be considered eligible for review if prevalence of medication non-adherence among adults with two or more chronic conditions is reported. Studies will be included in the review if available in English full text. Titles and abstracts will be screened by single review, with 20% of screening cross-checked by a second reviewer. Full-text articles will be screened by two independent reviewers, noting reasons for exclusions. Data extraction will be performed using a predefined extraction form. Quality and risk of bias assessment will be conducted using criteria for observational studies outlined by Sanderson et al. (2007). A narrative synthesis and, if feasible, meta-analysis will be conducted. Discussion: By exploring medication non-adherence from a multimorbidity perspective, the review aims to inform an evidence base for intervention development which accounts for the rising prevalence of patients with multiple chronic conditions.

OBJECTIVES To describe the experience of relatives during the COVID-19 pandemic and to derive support information for health professionals. METHODS Qualitative analysis of three written testimonies of relatives whose family members were hospitalized with COVID-19 or other disease at intensive care unit. RESULTS Relatives report the sudden, unexpected occurrence of the disease. ""It was there, out of nowhere, hits the heart of life, doesn't just go away, does what it wants. It is an unknown virus that we have to get to know very closely."" The ban on visiting was harsh, it made her faint. The first visit was an indescribable joy. Knowing how the family member was and that the health care professionals were taking professional and empathetic care of the sick person were the only things the relatives could hold on to. DISCUSSION Relatives were reassured when they experienced a high level of commitment on the part of health professionals and received repeated comprehensible information by phone.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Through collecting the measures and outcomes of preventing and controlling COVID-19 in China's three hospitals, we compared the effect of different strategies. RESULTS From January to March 2020, the number of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan increased exponentially, and Wuhan Children's Hospital as a whole was transformed into a designated quarantine and treatment facility, which is the ""Wuhan Model"". Shanghai has more children's hospitals with better capabilities to tackle public health emergency. Besides, it is far away from Wuhan and had a small caseload. Children's Hospital of Fudan University, a facility in Shanghai to treat pediatric infectious diseases, is famous for its well-equipped building for infectious disease treatment and professional medical team, and therefore no major transformation was required. That is the ""Shanghai Model"". Haikou is located on an island. Amid the outbreak, large numbers of tourists and travelers from Hubei had already arrived in Haikou. Hainan Women and Children's Medical Center, as the only pediatric care hospital in Hainan Province, did not have a separate building for infectious disease treatment. After a citywide survey of the medical resources and facilities available, a temporarily idle hospital 3 kilometers away from Hainan Women and Children's Medical Center was requisitioned as the quarantine and treatment facility for pediatric cases. That is the ""Hainan Model"". The three models enabled the treatment of all suspected and confirmed cases and no fatality was reported. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 coping strategies for children should be designed according to the existing conditions of the local children's hospitals and the risk levels of the epidemic.","Luo, Q; Yuan, L; Zhang, J; Wei, W; Xiang, W; Shao, J-B; Fan, L-C; Li, L; Zhai, X-W; Zhang, X-B; Zhou, A-F; Huang, G-Y; Gu, S",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,86,10

We aimed to characterize trends in neuroimaging utilization among acute stroke patients. Utilization of multimodal imaging for acute stroke in the community has remained largely uncharacterized despite its increased adoption at academic medical centers. METHODS We quantified neuroimaging utilization in the emergency department (ED) for 1,700 hyperacute stroke patients presenting <2 hours after symptom onset who participated in the National Institutes of Health Field Administration of Stroke Therapy-Magnesium (FAST-MAG) study throughout Los Angeles and Orange Counties. FAST-MAG provided no recommendation as to imaging utilization. RESULTS A total of 1,700 cases were imaged a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 92 (74-120) minutes after last known well time and 28 (19-41) minutes after ED arrival. The initial scanner used in the ED was computed tomography (CT) in a preponderance of cases (N = 1,612, 95%), with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 88 cases (5%). CT angiography (CTA) was obtained in 192 (11%) and perfusion CT (CTP) in 91 (5.4%) cases. MRI imaging was universally obtained using diffusion-weighted images, 60% with MR angiography and 33% included perfusion imaging. Rates of concomitant CTA or CTP use increased in the later years of the study from 4% in 2005-2006, 2% in 2007-2008, 8% in 2009-2010, and 26% in 2011-2012 (P for trend < .001). CONCLUSIONS Among acute stroke patients, noncontrast CT was the most common initial imaging strategy in clinical practice in the 2005-2012 time period, though use of concomitant CTA grew to one-quarter of cases, suggestive of an upward trend.","Sanossian, Nerses; Fu, Katherine A; Liebeskind, David S; Starkman, Sidney; Hamilton, Scott; Villablanca, J Pablo; Burgos, Adrian M; Conwit, Robin; Saver, Jeffrey L",Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,86,22

The present study aimed to investigate the incidence of and risk factors for NODAT using the Korean Organ Transplantation Registry (KOTRY) database. Methods Patients with history of pediatric transplantation (age ≤18 years), re-transplantation, multi-organ transplantation, or pre-existing diabetes mellitus were excluded. A total of 1,919 non-diabetic adult patients who underwent a primary LT between May 2014 and December 2017 were included. Risk factors were identified using Cox regression analysis. Results NODAT occurred in 19.7% (n=377) of adult liver transplant recipients. Multivariate analysis showed steroid use, increased age, and high body mass index (BMI) in recipients, and implantation of a left-side liver graft was closely associated with NODAT in adult LT. In living donor liver transplant (LDLT) patients (n=1,473), open donor hepatectomy in the living donors, steroid use, small for size liver graft (graft to recipient weight ratio ≤0.8), increased age, and high BMI in the recipient were predictive factors for NODAT. The use of antimetabolite and basiliximab induction reduced the incidence of NODAT in adult LT and in adult LDLT. Conclusions Basiliximab induction, early steroid withdrawal, and antimetabolite therapy may prevent NODAT after adult LT. High BMI or advanced age in liver recipients, open donor hepatectomy in living donors, and small size liver graft can predict the occurrence of NODAT after adult LT or LDLT.","Man Kim, Jong; Hwang, Shin; Lee, Kwang-Woong; Lee, Jae-Geun; Ryu, Je Ho; Kim, Bong-Wan; Choi, Dong Lak; You, Young Kyoung; Kim, Dong-Sik; Nah, Yang Won; Kang, Koo Jeong; Cho, Jai Young; Hong, Geun; Choi, In Seok; Yu, Hee Chul; Choi, Dongho; Kim, Myoung Soo",Hepatobiliary surgery and nutrition,86,19

We therefore investigated whether PLR, NLR or LMR are linked to target vessel restenosis (TVR) following infrainguinal angioplasty and stenting. Moreover, we studied on-treatment platelet reactivity and neutrophil-platelet aggregate (NPA) formation as potential underlying mechanisms. Platelet, neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte counts were determined one day after angioplasty and stenting in 95 stable PAD patients. Platelet reactivity and NPA formation in response to protease-activated receptor-1 stimulation were measured by light transmission aggregometry (LTA) and flow cytometry, respectively. PLR and NLR were significantly higher in patients who subsequently developed TVR (both p < 0.05). In contrast, LMR did not differ significantly between patients without and with TVR (p = 0.28). A PLR ≥ 91 and NLR ≥2.75 were identified as the best thresholds to predict TVR, providing sensitivities of 87.5% and 81.3%, and specificities of 34.9% and 50.8%, respectively, and were therefore defined as high PLR and high NLR. TVR occurred significantly more often in patients with high PLR and high NLR than in those with lower ratios (both p < 0.05). Patients with high PLR and high NLR exhibited significantly increased on-treatment platelet aggregation compared to those with lower ratios, and patients with high PLR had higher levels of NPA formation (all p < 0.01). In conclusion, PLR and NLR predict TVR after infrainguinal angioplasty with stent implantation. Platelet activation and neutrophil-platelet interaction may be involved in the underlying pathomechanisms.","Lee, Silvia; Hoberstorfer, Timothy; Wadowski, Patricia P; Kopp, Christoph W; Panzer, Simon; Gremmel, Thomas",Journal of clinical medicine,86,16

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether prevention of hypotension during anaesthesia induction could avoid haemodilution. METHODS Twenty-four cardiac surgery patients, 66 ± 10 years, were randomised to receive either norepinephrine in a dose needed to maintain mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) at pre-anaesthesia levels after induction or to a control group that received vasopressor if MAP decreased below 60 mmHg. No fluids were infused. Changes in plasma volume were calculated with standard formula: 100 × (Hct(pre)/Hct(post) - 1)/(1 - Hct(pre)). Arterial blood gas was analysed every 10 minutes and non-invasive continuous haemoglobin (SpHb) was continuously measured. RESULTS Pre-anaesthesia MAP was 98 ± 7 mmHg. Ten minutes after anaesthesia induction, the haematocrit decreased by 5.0 ± 2.5% in the control group compared with 1.2 ± 1.4% in the intervention group, which corresponds to increases in plasma volume by 310 ml and 85 ml respectively. MAP decreased to 69 ± 15 mmHg compared to 92 ± 10 mmHg in the intervention group. The difference maintained throughout the 70 min intervention period. The change in haemoglobin level measured by blood gas analysis could not be detected by SpHb measurement. The mean bias between the SpHb and blood gas haemoglobin was 15 g/l. CONCLUSION During anaesthesia induction, haematocrit decreases and plasma volume increases early and parallel to a decrease in blood pressure. This autotransfusion is blunted when blood pressure is maintained at pre-induction levels with norepinephrine.","Damén, T; Reinsfelt, B; Redfors, B; Nygren, A",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,86,1

We show here that viruses differing only in the envelope glycoprotein (Env) expressed on their surface have different sensitivities to IFITM3. Measurements of the sensitivity of viruses to neutralizing antibodies showed that IFITM3 increased the sensitivity of IFITM3-sensitive viruses to PG16, which targets the V1V2 loop, suggesting that IFITM3 promotes exposure of the PG16 epitope of IFITM3-sensitive viruses. Exchanges of V1V2 loops between the Env proteins of sensitive and resistant viruses revealed that V1V2 and V3 act together to modulate viral sensitivity to IFITM3. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that IFITM3 interacted with both the precursor (gp160) and cleaved (gp120) forms of Env from IFITM3-sensitive viruses, but only with the precursor (gp160) form of Env from IFITM3-resistant viruses. This finding suggests that the interaction between the Env of resistant viruses and IFITM3 was inhibited once Env had been processed in the Golgi apparatus. This hypothesis was supported by immunofluorescence experiments, which showed a strong colocalization of IFITM3 with the Env of sensitive viruses, but only weak colocalization with the Env of resistant viruses on the plasma membrane of virus-producing cells. Together, these results indicate that IFITM3 interacts with Env, inducing conformational changes that may decrease viral infectivity. This antiviral action is, nevertheless, modulated by the nature of the Env, in particular its V1V2 and V3 loops, which after maturation may be able to escape this interaction.IMPORTANCE Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is a cellular factor that reduces HIV-1 infectivity by an incompletely understood mechanism. This study aimed to elucidate the role of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) in determining viral susceptibility to IFITM3. We found that viruses differing only in Env expressed on their surface had different sensitivities to IFITM3. By comparing the Env proteins of viruses that were highly sensitive or resistant to IFITM3, we obtained new insight in the mechanisms by which HIV-1 escapes this protein. We showed that IFITM3 interacts with the Env protein of sensitive viruses in virion-producing cells, inducing conformational changes that may decrease viral infectivity. However, this antiviral action is modulated by the nature of Env, particularly the V1V2 and V3 loops, which may be able to escape this interaction after processing in the Golgi.","Drouin, Aurélie; Migraine, Julie; Durand, Marie-Alice; Moreau, Alain; Burlaud-Gaillard, Julien; Beretta, Maxime; Roingeard, Philippe; Bouvin-Pley, Mélanie; Braibant, Martine",Journal of virology,86,8

However, complications with potentially life-threating consequences may occur in rare cases. These complications might be very challenging to manage, even more in laparo-endoscopic interventions compared to open repair. One of these challenges can be the treatment of an intraoperative injury to the iliac vein. To the best of our knowledge, a lesion of the iliac vein during TEP (totally endoscopic preperitoneal) for inguinal hernia repair, and a safe technique for its management have not been reported yet. We report the case of a 75-year-old male patient with previous abdominal surgery scheduled for TEP repair of an inguinal hernia. During surgery, the iliac vein was damaged. If we had performed a laparotomy in this situation, the potentially life-threatening condition of the patient could have deteriorated further. Instead, to avoid a potential CO2 associated embolism, the preperitoneal pressure was gradually reduced, and the positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was increased in the manner that a balance between excessive bleeding and potential development of a CO2 embolism was achieved. The injured vein was sutured endoscopically, and in addition a hemostatic patch was applied. We then continued with the planned surgical procedure. Thrombosis of the sutured vein was prevented by prophylactic administration of low molecular weight heparin until the 14th postoperative day. We conclude that in case of major vein injury during TEP, which might happen irrespective of prior abdominal surgery, the preperitoneal pressure and PEEP adjustment can be used to handle the complication.","Tabriz, Navid; Uslar, Verena Nicole; Cetin, Timur; Marth, Andreas; Weyhe, Dirk",Frontiers in surgery,86,24

STUDY DESIGN Prospective, blinded, randomized study. ANIMALS Ninety-three healthy mixed breed cats. METHODS After premedication with intramuscular acepromazine (0.05 mg kg(-1)) and buprenorphine (0.01 mg kg(-1)), cats were randomly allocated to receive either propofol (Group P) or alfaxalone (Group A) for induction of anaesthesia. Following endotracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane vaporized in oxygen. The quality of induction, physiological parameters throughout anaesthesia and the duration of both surgery and anaesthesia were recorded. The level of ambient noise, recovery times, number of attempts to stand, reaction of the cat to touch 15 minutes after extubation, and other relevant characteristics of the recovery period were noted and a video recording of the recovery was made. The videos were assessed by a second, blinded anaesthetist, using simple descriptive and visual analogue scales. RESULTS No statistically significant differences between groups with respect to preoperative data, premedication, surgery, anaesthesia and recovery times and scores were observed. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of patients paddling and trembling on recovery in Group A (p = 0.032) even though there was no statistically significant difference in the level of ambient noise in the recovery ward or in the overall quality of recovery. CONCLUSIONS Both propofol and alfaxalone provide good recovery characteristics in premedicated cats undergoing short procedures in clinical settings. Alfaxalone induction was associated with more episodes of paddling and trembling during recovery.

METHODS This is a retrospective case series study conducted on patients with DRS, mimicking non-comitant exotropia or esotropia and a face turn. Patients were included only if they lacked either globe retraction on adduction (sine retraction) or limitation of adduction or abduction on ductions (sine limitation not >0.5). Any overshoots or pattern strabismus was recorded. The ocular motility and alignment, details of surgery and their surgical outcomes were analysed. RESULTS Twenty-one patients were identified; 13 in the sine retraction and 8 in the sine limitation group. All patients presented with a compensatory face turn. Overshoots were present in 10 (77%) and 7 patients (88%) in the sine retraction and sine limitation groups, respectively. Forced duction test showed tightness of the ipsilateral medial and the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle in esotropic (n = 3) and exotropic patients (n = 18), respectively. Orthotropia was achieved in 82% of patients following ipsilateral medial or lateral rectus muscle recession. CONCLUSIONS There is a subset of patients who present with motility pattern similar to DRS but lack its complete diagnostic criteria. The presence of a face turn, overshoots on adduction or an ipsilateral tightness of the affected muscle should make one consider DRS sine retraction/sine limitation. The patients in our study responded well to lines of management similar to those of DRS.","Awadein, Ahmed; Arfeen, Shaimaa A; Chougule, Pratik; Kekunnaya, Ramesh",Eye,86,31

METHODS This was a prospective, multicenter epilepsy monitoring study of autonomic and breathing biomarkers of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in patients ≥18 years old with intractable epilepsy and monitored GCS. Video-EEG, thoracoabdominal excursions, nasal airflow, capillary oxygen saturation, and ECG were analyzed. RESULTS We studied 148 GCS in 87 patients. Nineteen patients had generalized epilepsy; 65 had focal epilepsy; 1 had both; and the epileptogenic zone was unknown in 2. Ictal central apnea (ICA) preceded GCS in 49 of 121 (40.4%) seizures in 23 patients, all with focal epilepsy. Postconvulsive central apnea (PCCA) occurred in 31 of 140 (22.1%) seizures in 22 patients, with generalized, focal, or unknown epileptogenic zones. In 2 patients, PCCA occurred concurrently with asystole (near-SUDEP), with an incidence rate of 10.2 per 1,000 patient-years. One patient with PCCA died of probable SUDEP during follow-up, suggesting a SUDEP incidence rate 5.1 per 1,000 patient-years. No cases of laryngospasm were detected. Rhythmic muscle artifact synchronous with breathing was present in 75 of 147 seizures and related to stertorous breathing (odds ratio 3.856, 95% confidence interval 1.395-10.663, p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS PCCA occurred in both focal and generalized epilepsies, suggesting a different pathophysiology from ICA, which occurred only in focal epilepsy. PCCA was seen in 2 near-SUDEP cases and 1 probable SUDEP case, suggesting that this phenomenon may serve as a clinical biomarker of SUDEP. Larger studies are needed to validate this observation. Rhythmic postictal muscle artifact is suggestive of post-GCS breathing effort rather than a specific biomarker of laryngospasm.","Vilella, Laura; Lacuey, Nuria; Hampson, Johnson P; Rani, M R Sandhya; Sainju, Rup K; Friedman, Daniel; Nei, Maromi; Strohl, Kingman; Scott, Catherine; Gehlbach, Brian K; Zonjy, Bilal; Hupp, Norma J; Zaremba, Anita; Shafiabadi, Nassim; Zhao, Xiuhe; Reick-Mitrisin, Victoria; Schuele, Stephan; Ogren, Jennifer; Harper, Ronald M; Diehl, Beate; Bateman, Lisa; Devinsky, Orrin; Richerson, George B; Ryvlin, Philippe; Lhatoo, Samden D",Neurology,86,4

To make a correct diagnosis and improve the outcome of patients with DIC, several organisations have put forward DIC scoring systems. However, which criteria is the best to use for diagnosing DIC remains a continuing controversy even though many studies have been conducted to validate the diagnostic accuracy of each DIC scoring system. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of DIC criteria for the prediction of mortality in critically ill adult patients. The primary objective is to assess the predictive values of the DIC criteria of Japanese Association for Acute Medicine, International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare, Korean Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis and Chinese Diagnostic Scoring System for 28-day mortality. We will search electronic bibliographic databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts, perform full article reviews and extract study data. We will report study characteristics and assess methodological quality using the Quality of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-II tool. If pooling is appropriate, we will compute parameter estimates using bivariate random-effects and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic models to produce summary receiver operating curves, summary operating points (pooled sensitivity and specificity) and 95% confidence regions around the summary operating points. Clinical and methodological subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be performed to explore heterogeneity. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This systematic review will help physicians diagnose DIC accurately and improve their clinical practice in critically ill settings. Approval from an ethics committee is not required. The findings will be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective interventional longitudinal cohort study was made on 82 male patients without exclusion criteria who had an inguinal hernia. Patients underwent laparoscopic TAPP or open tension-free hernia repair. Vascular ultrasound and antisperm antibodies were measured in the preoperative and postoperative periods. Main outcome measures were resistive index (RI), peak systolic velocity (PSV) cm/s, and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cm/s in testicular blood flow measurement and the quantitative value of antisperm antibodies (ASA) in serum (IU/ml). RESULTS ASA significantly increased postoperatively only in patients who underwent open tension-free hernia repair (p < 0.001). ASA stayed in normal range in all patients except the one with postoperative complication. Friedman analysis showed significant change of the RI only on intratesticular (p < 0.001) and capsular artery level (0.02) in patients who underwent laparoscopic technique. PSV significantly changed on intratesticular (p < 0.001) and capsular artery level (p = 0.015) in the laparoscopic hernia repair. PSV showed significant change on intratesticular (p < 0.001) and testicular artery levels (p < 0.001) in the open tension-free hernia repair. EDV showed significant change only on testicular artery level (p = 0.032) in the patients who had open tension-free hernia repair. These blood flow parameters significantly increased in the early postoperative period and returned on basal value in the late postoperative period. Parameters of flow did not show any significant correlation with ASA. CONCLUSION Mesh hernia repairs without complication caused only a transitory change in testicular blood flow and no clinical significant autoimmune reaction.","Štula, Ivana; Družijanić, Nikica; Sapunar, Ada; Perko, Zdravko; Bošnjak, Nada; Kraljević, Damir",Surgical endoscopy,86,1

The purpose of this study was to provide a detailed 3D description of changes in Achilles free tendon morphology immediately following a single clinical bout of exercise. Freehand 3D ultrasound was used to measure Achilles free tendon length, and regional cross-sectional area (CSA), medio-lateral (ML) diameter and antero-posterior (AP) diameter in healthy young adults (N=14) at rest and during isometric muscle contraction, immediately before and after 3×15 eccentric heel drops. Post-exercise reductions in transverse strain were limited to CSA and AP diameter in the mid-proximal region of the Achilles free tendon during muscle contraction. The change in CSA strain during muscle contraction was significantly correlated to the change in longitudinal strain (r=-0.72) and the change in AP diameter strain (r=0.64). Overall findings suggest the Achilles free tendon experiences a complex change in 3D morphology following eccentric heel drop exercise that manifests under contractile but not rest conditions, is most pronounced in the mid-proximal tendon and is primarily driven by changes in AP diameter strain and not ML diameter strain.","Obst, Steven J; Newsham-West, Richard; Barrett, Rod S",The Journal of experimental biology,86,1

Supplemental oxygen is therefore given to all critically ill patients. This can result in hyperoxaemia, and some observational studies have identified harms with hyperoxia. The objective of this systematic review is to critically assess the evidence of randomised clinical trials on the effects of higher versus lower inspiratory oxygen fractions or targets of arterial oxygenation in critically ill adult patients. METHODS We will search for randomised clinical trials in major international databases. Two authors will independently screen and select references for inclusion using Covidence, extract data and assess the methodological quality of the included randomised clinical trials using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Any disagreement will be resolved by consensus. We will analyse the extracted data using Review Manager and Trial Sequential Analysis. To assess the quality of the evidence, we will create a 'Summary of Findings' table containing our primary and secondary outcomes using the GRADE assessment. DISCUSSION Supplemental oxygen administration is widely recommended in international guidelines despite lack of robust evidence of its effectiveness. To our knowledge, no systematic review of randomised clinical trials has investigated the effects of oxygen supplementation in critically ill patients. This systematic review will provide reliable evidence to better inform future trialists and decision-makers on clinical practice on supplemental oxygen administration in critically ill patients.","Barbateskovic, M; Schjørring, O L; Jakobsen, J C; Meyhoff, C S; Rasmussen, B S; Perner, A; Wetterslev, J",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,86,31

Most people with LBP receive the diagnosis of nonspecific LBP or sciatica. Medications are commonly prescribed but have limited analgesic effects and are associated with adverse events. A novel treatment approach is to target neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor (NGF) to reduce pain intensity. NGF inhibitors have been tested in some randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in recent years, showing promise for the treatment of chronic LBP; however, their efficacy and safety need to be evaluated to guide regulatory actions. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of medicines targeting neurotrophins in patients with LBP and sciatica. METHODS In this systematic review, we will include published and unpublished records of parallel RCTs and the first phase of crossover RCTs that compare the effects of medicines targeting neurotrophins with any control group. We will search the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, EU Clinical Trials Register, and WHO International Clinical Registry Platform databases from inception. Pairs of authors will independently screen the records for eligibility, and we will independently extract data in duplicate. We will conduct a quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis) with the studies that report sufficient data and compare the medicines of interest versus placebo. We will use random-effects models and calculate estimates of effects and heterogeneity for each outcome. We will assess the risk of bias for each study using the Cochrane Collaboration tool, and form judgments of confidence in the evidence according to GRADE recommendations. We will use the PRISMA statement to report the findings. We plan to conduct subgroup analyses by condition, type of medication, and time point. We will also assess the impact of a potential new trial on an existing meta-analysis. Data from studies that meet inclusion criteria but cannot be included in the meta-analysis will be reported narratively. RESULTS The protocol was registered on the Open Science Framework on May 19, 2020. As of December 2020, we have identified 1932 records. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review and meta-analysis will assess the evidence for the efficacy and safety of NGF inhibitors for pain in patients with nonspecific LBP and sciatica. The inclusion of new studies and unpublished data may improve the precision of the effect estimates and guide regulatory actions of the medications for LBP and sciatica.

Testosterone deficiency may contribute to earlier onset of metabolic syndrome. The study aimed to assess connections between serum testosterone concentrations and metabolic disorders as well as body composition in TGCT survivors. 336 TGCT patients with over two years of complete post-treatment remission were divided into three groups: definite testosterone deficiency (< 8 nmol/L), 'grey zone' (8-12 nmol/L) and normal testosterone (> 12 nmol/L; control group) to assess differences in metabolism. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. The multivariate analysis assessed the risk of metabolic disorders and changes in body composition with regard to testosterone concentrations adjusted for age, smoking history, clinical stage, type of treatment and follow-up period. 14% of patients presented with definite testosterone deficiency; 46% were in the 'grey zone'. On multivariate analysis, low testosterone levels were related to hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, inflammatory processes, procoagulant state and obesity. The odds ratio (OR) for the onset of metabolic syndrome was 2.87 (95% CI 1.74-4.73, p < 0.001) for the 'grey zone' patients and 7.92 (95% CI 3.76-16.70, p < 0.001) for those with definite testosterone deficiency. Testosterone concentrations were independently associated with metabolic disorders in TGCT survivors. Testicular cancer survivors often have lower testosterone and metabolic disorders.

MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2013 to September 2016, 195 patients received 267 sessions of CT-guided RFA for liver tumors at our institution. The CT images during and immediately after the RFA were retrospectively reviewed. The frequency of hemobilia development and clinical outcome of patients with hemobilia were studied. Risk factors were identified by comparison between the hemobilia and non-hemobilia groups using univariate and multivariate analysis. The clinical courses of patients with hemobilia were also reviewed. RESULTS The frequency of CT detected hemobilia after RFA was 8.2% (22/267). The majority of the clinical courses were self-limited. Univariate analysis showed that the tumor numbers (p = 0.015), the central type puncture track (p < 0.001), the length of the puncture track (p = 0.033), and the platelet count (p = 0.026) were significantly associated with the development of hemobilia. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the central type puncture track (p < 0.024) and the platelet count (p = 0.023) were significant independent risk factors. CONCLUSION Detection of hemobilia on CT images immediately after percutaneous RFA for liver tumors was not rare. Low platelet count and central type puncture track are independent risk factors. In most cases, hemobilia presented as a minor complication with favorable prognosis.","Hsieh, Mei-Fang; Chen, Chia-Bang; Chen, Yao-Li; Chou, Chen-Te",Abdominal radiology,86,1

As cell productivity directly affects the cost of production, methods have been developed to manipulate the expression of specific genes that are known to be involved in protein synthesis, folding, and secretion to increase productivity. However, there have been no large-scale CHO-specific functional screens to identify novel gene targets that impact the production of secreted recombinant proteins. Here, we performed a large-scale, CHO cell-specific small interfering RNA screen to identify genes that consistently enhanced antibody production when silenced in a panel of seven CHO cell lines. Four genes, namely Cyp1a2, Atp5s, Dgki, and P3h2, were identified, and then selected for CRISPR-Cas9 knockout validation in recombinant CHO cell lines. Single knockout of Cyp1a2, Atp5s, or Dgki, but not P3h2, resulted in a more than 90% increase in specific antibody productivity. Overall, the knockout of Cyp1a2 demonstrated the most significant improvement of antibody production, with a minimal impact on cell growth. This article is protected by copyright.

This systematic review and meta-analysis examine available evidence for accuracy of laryngeal ultrasound in diagnosing vocal cord immobility in infants and children after surgery and trauma affecting the vocal cords. DESIGN Medical subject heading terms were used to search MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for relevant citations. Publications from January 1, 2000, to June 30, 2020 were included in the search strategy. Study inclusion criteria consisted of randomized control trials and nonrandomized retrospective or prospective observational studies where vocal cord motion was evaluated by laryngeal ultrasound and compared with a reference test. Studies were excluded if there was insufficient data to compute a sensitivity/specificity table. Case reports, case series less than 10, and manuscripts not published in English were also excluded. PATIENTS Studies which included subjects younger than or equal to 18 years were considered for full article review. SETTINGS No restrictions on study settings were imposed in this systematic review. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The initial search returned 1,357 citations. After de-duplication, abstract, and full review, eight citations were included in the final meta-analysis. A bivariate random-effects meta-analysis was performed, which revealed a pooled sensitivity for laryngeal ultrasound in detecting vocal cord immobility of 91% (95% CI, 83-95%), specificity of 97% (95% CI, 82-100%), diagnostic odds ratio 333.56 (95% CI, 34.00-3,248.71), positive likelihood ratio 31.58 (95% CI, 4.50-222.05), and negative likelihood ratio 0.09 (95% CI, 0.05-0.19).

OBJECTIVE We conducted a systematic review of studies investigating associations between MF (i.e., strength/power, local muscular endurance) and physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and sleep in children and adolescents. METHODS A systematic search of six electronic databases was performed on 8 March, 2017. Search results were screened for relevance and studies conducted with children and adolescents (3-18 years) that explored associations between MF and physical activity, sedentary behavior, or sleep were considered eligible. Data were extracted and checked by a second author. The proportion of studies reporting a statistically significant association between each MF component and behavioral variables was calculated, and additional coding was conducted to account for risk of bias. RESULTS There was consistent evidence for a positive association between MF and physical activity. For both MF components, there was support for objectively measured physical activity, particularly for activity of vigorous intensity. Sports participation was also consistently linked with both MF components, whereas the association with active transport was inconsistent. For both MF components, associations with sedentary behaviors were inconsistent irrespective of measurement method, and the association between MF and sleep was considered uncertain. CONCLUSIONS The available evidence supports a link between MF and physical activity, particularly for vigorous intensity activity and organized sports participation. Conversely, there is limited support for an association with sedentary behaviors, and more research exploring MF and sleep is required.","Smith, Jordan J; Eather, Narelle; Weaver, R Glenn; Riley, Nicholas; Beets, Michael W; Lubans, David R",Sports medicine,86,16

Despite various attempts to improve the diagnosis and therapy of ovarian cancer patients, the survival rate for these patients is still dismal, mainly because most of them are diagnosed at a late stage. Up to 90% of ovarian cancers arise from neoplastic transformation of ovarian surface epithelial cells, and are usually referred to as epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Unlike most human cancers, which are disseminated through blood-borne metastatic routes, EOC has traditionally been thought to be disseminated through direct migration of ovarian tumor cells to the peritoneal cavity and omentum via peritoneal fluid. It has recently been shown, however, that EOC can also be disseminated through blood-borne metastatic routes, challenging previous thoughts about ovarian cancer metastasis. CONCLUSIONS Here, we review our current understanding of the most updated cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying EOC metastasis and discuss in more detail two main metastatic routes of EOC, i.e., transcoelomic metastasis and hematogenous metastasis. The emerging concept of blood-borne EOC metastasis has led to exploration of the significance of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as novel and non-invasive prognostic markers in this daunting cancer. We also evaluate the role of tumor stroma, including cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), endothelial cells, adipocytes, dendritic cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) components in EOC growth and metastasis. Lastly, we discuss therapeutic approaches for targeting EOC. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying EOC metastasis will open up avenues to the design of new therapeutic options. For instance, understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the hematogenous metastasis of EOC, the biology of CTCs, and the detailed mechanisms through which EOC cells take advantage of stromal cells may help to find new opportunities for targeting EOC metastasis.","Yousefi, Meysam; Dehghani, Sadegh; Nosrati, Rahim; Ghanei, Mahmoud; Salmaninejad, Arash; Rajaie, Sara; Hasanzadeh, Malihe; Pasdar, Alireza",Cellular oncology,86,22

However, olfaction has been evaluated solely on reported symptoms, after COVID-19 diagnosis, and in both mild and severe COVID-19 cases, but rarely has it been assessed in prospectively unselected populations. Objective To evaluate the diagnostic value of a semiobjective olfactory test developed to assess patient-reported chemosensory dysfunction prior to testing for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients attending a COVID-19 screening facility. Design, Setting, and Participants This prospective diagnostic study with participants and observers blinded to COVID-19 status was conducted in a COVID-19 screening center of a tertiary university hospital in France from March 23 to April 22, 2020. Participants were 854 consecutively included health care workers or outpatients with symptoms or with close contact with an index case. Exclusion criteria were prior chemosensory dysfunction, testing inability, or contraindications (n = 45). Main Outcomes and Measures Participants were interviewed to ascertain their symptoms and then underwent Clinical Olfactory Dysfunction Assessment (CODA), an ad hoc test developed for a simple and fast evaluation of olfactory function. This assessment followed a standardized procedure in which participants identified and rated the intensity of 3 scents (lavender, lemongrass, and mint) to achieve a summed score ranging from 0 to 6. The COVID-19 status was assessed using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in samples collected via nasopharyngeal swab (reference standard) to calculate the diagnostic values of patient-reported chemosensory dysfunction and CODA. Results Of 809 participants, the female to male sex ratio was 2.8, and the mean (SD) age was 41.8 (13.0) years (range, 18-94 years). All participants, if symptomatic, had mild disease at the time of testing, and 58 (7.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Chemosensory dysfunction was reported by 20 of 58 participants (34.5%) with confirmed COVID-19 vs 29 of 751 participants (3.9%) who tested negative for COVID-19 (absolute difference, 30.6% [95% CI, 18.3%-42.9%]). Olfactory dysfunction, either self-reported or clinically ascertained (CODA score ≤3), yielded similar sensitivity (0.31 [95% CI, 0.20-0.45] vs 0.34 [95% CI, 0.22-0.48]) and specificity (0.97 [95% CI, 0.96-0.98) vs 0.98 [95% CI, 0.96-0.99]) for COVID-19 diagnosis. Concordance was high between reported and clinically tested olfactory dysfunction, with a Gwet AC1 of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97). Of 19 participants, 15 (78.9%) with both reported olfactory dysfunction and a CODA score of 3 or lower were confirmed to have COVID-19. The CODA score also revealed 5 of 19 participants (26.3%) with confirmed COVID-19 who had previously unperceived olfactory dysfunction. Conclusions and Relevance In this prospective diagnostic study of outpatients with asymptomatic or mild to moderate COVID-19, systematically assessed anamnesis and clinical testing with the newly developed CODA were complementary and specific for chemosensory dysfunction. Olfactory dysfunction was suggestive of COVID-19, particularly when clinical testing confirmed anamnesis.

Several biomarkers were evaluated as predictors for progression towards severe disease. IL-21 is a member of common ?-chain cytokine family and creates some specific effects during programming and maintenance of antiviral immunity. We aimed to assess IL-21 as a biomarker for diagnosis and outcome prediction in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Method Patients with a preliminary diagnosis of COVID-19 and pneumonia other than COVID-19 admitted to a tertiary care hospital were included consecutively in this comparative study. Results The study population consisted of 51 patients with COVID-19 and 11 patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia. Serum IL-21 concentration was markedly higher and serum CRP concentration was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients compared to non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Within COVID-19 patients 10 patients showed radiological and clinical progression. Patients with clinical worsening had lower lymphocyte count and haemoglobin. In addition to that deteriorating patients had higher urea, LDH levels and elevated concentration of both IL-6 and IL-21. The cut-off value of 106 ng/L for IL-21 has 80.0% sensitivity, %60.9 specificity for discriminating patients with clinical worsening. Multivariable analysis performed to define risk factors for disease progression identified IL-6 and IL-21 as independent predictors. Odds ratio for serum IL-6 concentrations ? 3.2 pg/mL was 8.07 (95% CI: 1.37-47.50, p=0.04) and odds ratio for serum IL-21 concentrations ? 106 ng/L was 6.24 (95% CI: 1.04 ? 37.3, p=0.02). Conclusion We identified specific differences in serum IL-21 between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Serum IL-21 measurement has promising predictive value for disease progression in COVID-19 patients. High serum IL-6 and IL-21 levels obtained upon admission are independent risk factors for clinical worsening.","Acet Öztürk, Nilüfer Aylin; Ursavaş, Ahmet; Görek Dilektaşli, Asli; Demirdöğen, Ezgi; Coşkun, Necmiye Funda; Ediger, Dane; Uzaslan, Ayşe Esra; Yöyen Ermiş, Diğdem; Karaca, Mert; Terzi, Orkun Eray; Bayram, Merve; Ömer Topçu, Dilara; Yiğitliler, Büşra; Yurttaş, Ahmet; Maharramov, Shahriyar; Yazici, Gamze; Oral, Haluk Barbaros; Karadağ, Mehmet",Turkish journal of medical sciences,86,10

Hsp10 has been detected during early pregnancy in serum of mice, sheep, pigs, horses, cows, and humans by the rosette inhibition test. Hsp10 has also been associated with several neoplastic and autoimmune diseases. The goal of the present study was to determine if Hsp10 could be detected in the early equine embryo through the use of immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR. Additionally, analysis of systemically harvested peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from both pregnant and nonpregnant mares was evaluated to determine expression levels of HSP10. Embryos were collected from Quarter Horse mares by uterine lavage at either 8 or 25 days after ovulation. Collection and separation of PBMCs occurred on Day 8 for both pregnant and nonpregnant mares. Immunohistochemistry revealed cytoplasmic localization of HSP10 throughout the single layer of ectodermal cells forming the trophoblast in Day-8 embryos. Day-25 embryos demonstrated intense localization focally along the apical border of ectodermal cells forming the trophoblast layer of the developing chorion. There was no nuclear staining in either embryonic population. Quantitative real-time PCR detected the presence of mRNA for HSP10 in both 8- and 25-day equine embryos. Day-25 embryos exhibited an elevated degree of expression (P = 0.006) compared with the 8-day embryos for HSP10. Endometrial samples did not display any significant difference in degree of expression for HSP10 (P = 0.10). Finally, PBMCs from pregnant mares demonstrated elevated (P = 0.03) expression of HSP10 compared to the nonpregnant mares on Day 8 of the estrous cycle. This study confirmed the presence of HSP10 protein and mRNA expression of HSP10 in equine embryos at two maturation stages. Additionally, the presence of increased gene expression within PBMCs of pregnant mares suggests communication, possibly leading to necessary immunomodulatory effects between the embryo and mare.","Hatzel, J N; Bouma, G J; Cleys, E R; Bemis, L T; Ehrhart, E J; McCue, P M",Theriogenology,86,30

We evaluated a rural Appalachian cohort of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) for its relation to obesity. METHODS Using American Thoracic Society 2018 diagnostic guidelines, an IPF cohort was systematically identified at an Appalachian academic medical center (2015-2019). The cohort was categorized in subgroups of body mass index (BMI) <30 or BMI ≥30 kg/m2. Demographics, clinical variables, and treatment details were collected retrospectively and evaluated for their associations with obesity. RESULTS In our IPF cohort (N = 138), a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern was less prevalent in the obese group (n = 49) relative to the nonobese group (69% vs 85%, respectively). The obese group was younger (mean age 73.27 ± 9.12 vs 77.97 ± 9.59 years) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension (90% vs 72%), hyperlipidemia (83% vs 68%), diabetes mellitus (47% vs 25%), sleep-disordered breathing (47% vs 25%), chronic pain disorders (28% vs 15%), and deep vein thrombosis (19% vs 7%). An increased proportion of obese-IPF patients was seen at a tertiary or an interstitial lung disease center, with more surgical lung biopsies performed and incident diagnosis (ie, within 6 months of presentation) assigned. Only a minority of patients underwent lung transplantation (3.6%), all of them from the obese-IPF subgroup. Approximately 30% of the total IPF cohort died, with a lower mortality observed in the obese group (35% vs 20%, P = 0.017). An increasing BMI predicted a better survival in the total IPF cohort (BMI 25-29.9, 20-24.9, and <20 had mortality rates of 20%, 47%, and 75%, respectively; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Our study represents a first known effort to develop an IPF cohort in a rural Appalachian region. Although they shared an increased burden of comorbidities, the obese subgroup showed less advanced fibrosis with a lower mortality rate relative to nonobese subgroup, suggesting a potential ""obesity paradox"" in IPF. The study findings significantly advance our understanding of challenges posed by IPF in a rural population that also suffers from an alarming rate of obesity. We highlight the need for the multidisciplinary management of these patients and prospective studies to better define this complex relation.","Sangani, Rahul G; Ghio, Andrew J; Mujahid, Hasan; Patel, Zalak; Catherman, Kristen; Wen, Sijin; Parker, John E",Southern medical journal,86,15

A maladaptive stress response is implicated in both mental health disorders and metabolic disorders, implicating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis as a key mediator of this relationship. This review explores how an altered energetic state, such as hyper- or hypoglycemia, as may be manifested in obesity or diabetes, affects the stress response and the HPA axis in particular. We propose that changes in energetic state or energetic demands can result in ""energetic stress"" that can, if prolonged, lead to a dysfunctional stress response. In this review, we summarize the role of the hypothalamus in modulating energy homeostasis and then briefly discuss the relationship between metabolism and stress-induced activation of the HPA axis. Next, we examine seven mechanisms whereby energetic stress interacts with neuroendocrine stress response systems, including by glucocorticoid signaling both within and beyond the HPA axis; by nutrient-induced changes in glucocorticoid signaling; by impacting the sympathetic nervous system; through changes in other neuroendocrine factors; by inducing inflammatory changes; and by altering the gut-brain axis. Recognizing these effects of energetic stress can drive novel therapies and prevention strategies for mental health disorders, including dietary intervention, probiotics, and even fecal transplant.","Harrell, C S; Gillespie, C F; Neigh, G N",Physiology & behavior,86,5

The purpose of this study is to determine whether native Sharp's angle is associated with an increased abduction angle of the acetabular component. METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent primary total hip replacement between February 2012 and August 2015 were included. Vertical positioning of acetabular implant in the antero-posterior post-operative radiographs were measured. The proportion of implants positioned outside the safe zone (40° ± 10°) was calculated and through a multivariate analysis, Sharp's angle and other factors possibly associated with cup malpositioning were evaluated. RESULTS Five hundred twenty-eight hip arthroplasties were analyzed. Prevalence of cup malpositioning was 7.6% and 25 patients had an altered native acetabular angle. An altered pre-operative Sharp's angle was associated with a higher risk of vertical malpositioning of the acetabular component (OR 2.51 IC 95%: 1.17-5.39) (p = 0.02). Body mass index, surgeon's volume, size of the implant, gender, pre-operative diagnose and age, were not associated with the position of the cup. CONCLUSIONS The alteration of the Sharp's angle as an indicator of hip dysplasia in native hips increases the odds of acetabular cup malpositioning. Other factors explored did not correlate with the position of the acetabular prosthesis. Systematic assessment of Sharp's angle should be included in the pre-operative planning of primary hip arthroplasty.","Rojas, Jorge; Bautista, Maria; Bonilla, Guillermo; Amado, Omar; Huerfano, Elina; Monsalvo, Daniel; Llinás, Adolfo; Navas, José",International orthopaedics,86,28

The virus circulates as many different types (~160), each generating strong homologous, but weak heterotypic, immunity. The influence of these features on transmission patterns of HRV in the community is understudied. Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI) at nine out-patient facilities across a Health and Demographic Surveillance System between December 2015 and November 2016. HRV was diagnosed by real-time RT-PCR, and the VP4/VP2 genomic region of the positive samples sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis was used to determine the HRV types. Classification models and G-test statistic were used to investigate HRV type spatial distribution. Demographic characteristics and clinical features of ARI were also compared. Results: Of 5,744 NPS samples collected, HRV was detected in 1057 (18.4%), of which 817 (77.3%) were successfully sequenced. HRV species A, B and C were identified in 360 (44.1%), 67 (8.2%) and 390 (47.7%) samples, respectively. In total, 87 types were determined: 39, 10 and 38 occurred within species A, B and C, respectively. HRV types presented heterogeneous temporal patterns of persistence. Spatially, identical types occurred over a wide distance at similar times, but there was statistically significant evidence for clustering of types between health facilities in close proximity or linked by major road networks. Conclusion: This study records a high prevalence of HRV in out-patient presentations exhibiting high type diversity. Patterns of occurrence suggest frequent and independent community invasion of different types. Temporal differences of persistence between types may reflect variation in type-specific population immunity. Spatial patterns suggest either rapid spread or multiple invasions of the same type, but evidence of similar types amongst close health facilities, or along road systems, indicate type partitioning structured by local spread.","Morobe, John Mwita; Nyiro, Joyce; Brand, Samuel; Kamau, Everlyn; Gicheru, Elijah; Eyase, Fredrick; Otieno, Grieven; Munywoki, Patrick; Agoti, Charles; Nokes, James",Wellcome open research,86,1

Laparoscopic repair of colonoscopic perforations has been reported to be a safe and effective treatment. Aim We present our surgical technique and outcomes of laparoscopic repairs using an endoscopic linear stapler for iatrogenic colonic perforation during screening colonoscopy. Material and methods Laparoscopic repair using an endoscopic linear stapler for iatrogenic colonic perforation during screening colonoscopy was performed by two experienced laparoscopic surgeons on 14 consecutive patients between April 2010 and December 2017 at our hospital. Using prospectively collected data, an observational study was performed on a per protocol basis. Results The mean age of the 14 patients who underwent laparoscopic repair was 56.6 ±9.1 years. The most common perforation site was the sigmoid colon in 10 (71.4%) patients, followed by the rectosigmoid junction in 3 (21.4%) patients and the splenic flexure in 1 (7.1%) patient. The median perforation size was 10 (range: 5-30) mm. The mean operation time was 73.9 ±28.2 min. Postoperative complications occurred in 1 (7.1%) patient. There was no postoperative mortality or reoperation within 30 days after surgery. The median time to tolerance of a regular diet was 5 (range: 3-6) days. The median postoperative hospital stay was 8.5 (range: 5-15) days. Conclusions Laparoscopic repair using an endoscopic linear stapler is a safe, easy, and effective surgical technique to treat colonic perforation related to screening colonoscopy.","Kim, Tae Woon; Kim, Hyung Ook; Jung, Kyung Uk; Lee, Sung Ryol",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,86,31

Methods: GSE76427 data set was collected through GEO database, and DEGs were identified using GEO2R online analysis. Go and KEGG databases were used for enrichment and functional annotation of DEGs. Protein interaction network was built based on the STRING database and Cytoscape software to analyze the key genes of hepatocellular carcinoma, and the survival curve of these key genes were analyzed using the GEPIA database. Results: A total of 74 hepatocellular carcinoma DEGs were screened, of which 3 and 71 were up-and-down-regulated genes. The results of GO enrichment analysis showed that the down-regulated DEGs were mainly involved in cell response to cadmium and zinc ions, negative growth regulation, heterologous metabolic processes and hormone-mediated signaling pathways. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis results showed that the down-regulated DEGs pathway were mainly involved in retinol metabolism, chemical carcinogenesis, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, cytochrome P450 metabolizing xenobiotics, tryptophan metabolism and caffeine metabolism. Protein interaction network had screened out 10 down-regulated core genes: MT1G, MT1F, MT1X, MT1E, MT1H, insulin-like growth factor 1, FOS, CXCL12, EGR1, and BGN. Among them, the insulin-like growth factor 1 was related to the prognosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma.

Trials must start rapidly to identify treatments that can be used as part of the outbreak response, in the midst of considerable uncertainty and limited information. COVID-19 presentation is heterogeneous, ranging from mild disease that improves within days to critical disease that can last weeks to over a month and can end in death. While improvement in mortality would provide unquestionable evidence about the clinical significance of a treatment, sample sizes for a study evaluating mortality are large and may be impractical, particularly given a multitude of putative therapies to evaluate. Furthermore, patient states in between ""cure"" and ""death"" represent meaningful distinctions. Clinical severity scores have been proposed as an alternative. However, the appropriate summary measure for severity scores has been the subject of debate, particularly given the variable time course of COVID-19. Outcomes measured at fixed time points, such as a comparison of severity scores between treatment and control at day 14, may risk missing the time of clinical benefit. An endpoint such as time to improvement (or recovery) avoids the timing problem. However, some have argued that power losses will result from reducing the ordinal scale to a binary state of ""recovered"" versus ""not recovered."" METHODS We evaluate statistical power for possible trial endpoints for COVID-19 treatment trials using simulation models and data from two recent COVID-19 treatment trials. RESULTS Power for fixed time-point methods depends heavily on the time selected for evaluation. Time-to-event approaches have reasonable statistical power, even when compared with a fixed time-point method evaluated at the optimal time. DISCUSSION Time-to-event analysis methods have advantages in the COVID-19 setting, unless the optimal time for evaluating treatment effect is known in advance. Even when the optimal time is known, a time-to-event approach may increase power for interim analyses.","Dodd, Lori E; Follmann, Dean; Wang, Jing; Koenig, Franz; Korn, Lisa L; Schoergenhofer, Christian; Proschan, Michael; Hunsberger, Sally; Bonnett, Tyler; Makowski, Mat; Belhadi, Drifa; Wang, Yeming; Cao, Bin; Mentre, France; Jaki, Thomas",Clinical trials,86,19

This article analyzes peer-reviewed research on the epidemiology and outcomes of COVID-19 in those with IMID. RECENT FINDINGS Published literature on approximately 1400 patients was included from rheumatology, gastroenterology, and dermatology. Data suggest that those who are older and have comorbidities have poorer outcomes. This is consistent with the reports from the general population of patients with COVID-19. Adjusted analyses from the largest published studies demonstrate independent effects of systemic glucocorticoids, as well as age and comorbidities with poorer COVID-19 outcomes (SECURE-IBD registry, n = 525; COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry, n = 600); biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has not been associated with more severe outcomes. These early results will require validation in population-based studies as more data becomes available. SUMMARY Current data suggest that similar to the general population, age, and comorbidities are risk factors for poorer COVID-19 outcomes in patients with IMID.

Currently the blood supply is much safer because of very sensitive testing for HIV as well as hepatitis C. However, new infectious agents emerge constantly and pose a threat to our blood supply. Current and potential threats are reviewed in this manuscript. METHODS Review of pertinent English language literature. RESULTS Transmission of infectious agents from blood transfusion is rare. Protozoans pose one the greatest threats because there are no assays available that can reliably detect their presence and because of worldwide travel. Viruses potentially pose a significant threat to the blood supply. The West Nile virus has recently been transmitted by a blood transfusion that was negative by assay for WNV. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) poses a threat to the blood supply but has never been transmitted in a transfusion. Prions also have been transmitted by a blood transfusion.

However, the recurrence risk after embolization mandates closer follow-up than surgical clip ligation. Currently, there is no reliable system for predicting aneurysm sac thrombosis. An aneurysm embolization grade (AEG) reported previously by the senior author (EMD) has been proposed as a tool for predicting the durability of aneurysm occlusion based on hemodynamic characteristics. Here, we present our internal validity results. METHODS AEG and Raymond-Roy Occlusion Classification (RROC) scores were prospectively assigned to all aneurysms coiled from June 2008 to June 2011. The prospectively assigned AEG and RROC scores from the cerebral angiograms were collected for data analysis and validity assessment of the AEG system. 110 consecutive patients who had aneurysm coil embolization were included in this study. RESULTS The post-coiling AEG significantly predicted follow-up angiographic filling characteristics. Pairwise comparisons revealed that the follow-up AEG for those initially scored 'A' (complete obliteration) was significantly better than the contrast-flow groups. Significant differences were also noted between contrast-stasis and contrast-flow groups. A pairwise comparison between RROC scores demonstrated that only the RROC Type 1 could be used to predict follow-up occlusion durability. Stent placement in wide-neck aneurysms had no effect on initial AEG, RROC, or long-term occlusion durability. Packing density significantly predicted initial AEG and RROC, but had no effect on long-term occlusion. CONCLUSIONS The AEG system is uniquely based on angiographic filling characteristics of the aneurysm, and this study demonstrated its high predictive value for determining aneurysm sac thrombosis. Assigning an AEG to the aneurysm can guide the neurointerventionalist in discussions with the patient regarding the probability of aneurysm recurrence and potential need for retreatment.","Singla, Amit; Villwock, Mark R; Jacobsen, Walter; Deshaies, Eric M",Acta neurochirurgica,86,28

Minimally invasive approaches are being increasingly used. We compare our growing series of minimally invasive (combined thoracoscopic and laparoscopic) esophagectomies (MIEs) with a series of open transthoracic esophagectomies. STUDY DESIGN We identified 65 patients who underwent an MIE with thoracoscopy/laparotomy (n = 11), Ivor Lewis (n = 2), or 3-hole approach (n = 52). These patients were compared with 53 patients who underwent open Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy (n = 15) or 3-hole esophagectomy (n = 38) over the past 10 years. RESULTS The MIE and open groups were similar regarding gender and average age. The majority of patients in the open group underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (81%); a significantly smaller (43%) number of patients in the MIE group underwent neoadjuvant therapy (p < 0.0001). Regarding oncologic efficacy, 97% and 94% of patients in both groups underwent R0 resections. Patients undergoing MIE had a significant increase in the number of harvested lymph nodes (median 20 vs 9; p < 0.0001). Length of stay was significantly decreased in patients who underwent MIE (8.5 days vs 16 days; p = 0.002). Finally, there were significantly fewer serious complications (grades 3-5) in the MIE group (19% vs 48%; p = 0.0008). CONCLUSIONS In this initial report of a single-institution series of MIE, we demonstrate that oncologic efficacy is not compromised and may actually be improved with a significantly increased number of harvested LNs. We also demonstrate that this approach is associated with fewer serious complications and a significant decrease in the length of postoperative hospital stay.","Berger, Adam C; Bloomenthal, Aaron; Weksler, Benny; Evans, Nathaniel; Chojnacki, Karen A; Yeo, Charles J; Rosato, Ernest L",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,86,16

BACKGROUND With the growing focus on health-related research in Danish design practice, knowing how to translate research findings into research-informed design strategies becomes a preferable, if not (yet) a critical, skill. This calls for architecture educations to reconsider their graduate profiles and teaching curricula, thereby addressing research-to-practice gap. METHOD Based on design project hand-ins, we evaluate whether students participating in the AHW course demonstrate greater sensibility toward user experiences and research-based design (RBD) in their master thesis projects, compared to students attending a more traditional architectural tectonic track. Evaluation relates to the use of scientific literature and theoretical frameworks on topics like ""healing architecture"" and applied user-oriented methods (interviews, personas, demographics). RESULTS Our explorative analysis indicates that students have the skills to make a detailed user analysis when it comes to well-defined user groups in a highly specialized building (e.g., hospice patients and staff). The extent to which health-related research and user perspectives are applied in the design process seems to be primarily driven by thematic focus of the project (welfare buildings in contrast to housing). CONCLUSION Despite the challenges in teaching students to assess and apply academic literature, a RBD paradigm in architectural education can help bridge emerging research knowledge with design skills and professional competencies.","Tvedebrink, Tenna Doktor Olsen; Jelić, Andrea",HERD,86,1

We evaluated 3 different commercially available single-incision laparoscopic port access devices for their ease of use. METHODS Four laparoscopic surgeons performed multiple laparoscopic procedures through a single fascial incision in a porcine model. Three different commercially available access devices were used and evaluated for performance on a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS All procedures were successfully completed. Tissue dissection and retraction were challenging because of instrument crowding and lack of triangulation. Two of the tested devices included trocars in the design, maximum trocar size of 12 mm versus 15 mm. Quoted cost for the devices varied widely with the sleeve device at the lower end and the disk shaped at the higher end. CONCLUSIONS All tested devices allowed the performance of the attempted procedures.

There currently exist few randomized data exploring novel radiosensitizers to improve response and it is unclear what the clinical endpoints of such trials should be. METHODS A qualitative systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines using preset search criteria across the PubMed, Cochrane and Scopus databases from 1990 to 2017. Additional results were generated from the reference lists of included papers. RESULTS A total of 123 papers were identified, of which 37 were included; a further 60 articles were obtained from additional referencing to give a total of 97 articles. Neoadjuvant radiosensitization for locally advanced rectal cancer using fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy remains the standard of treatment. The oral derivative capecitabine has practical advantages over 5-fluorouracil, with equal efficacy, but the addition of a second chemotherapeutic agent has yet to show a consistent significant efficacy benefit in randomized clinical assessment. Preclinical and early-phase trials are progressing with promising novel agents, such as small molecular inhibitors and nanoparticles. CONCLUSION Despite extensive research and promising preclinical studies, a definite further agent in addition to fluoropyrimidines that consistently improves response rate has yet to be found.","Clifford, R; Govindarajah, N; Parsons, J L; Gollins, S; West, N P; Vimalachandran, D",The British journal of surgery,86,27

We determined the prognostic significance of dIVH in the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Haemorrhage Trials (INTERACT 1 and 2). METHODS Pooled analyses of the INTERACT CT substudies-international, multicentre, prospective, open, blinded end point, randomised controlled trials of patients with acute spontaneous ICH and elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP)-randomly assigned to intensive (<140 mm Hg) or guideline-based (<180 mm Hg) SBP management. Participants had blinded central analyses of baseline and 24 h CTs, with dIVH defined as new intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) on the latter scan. Outcomes of death and major disability were defined by modified Rankin Scale scores at 90 days. RESULTS There were 349 (27%) of 1310 patients with baseline IVH, and 107 (11%) of 961 initially IVH-free patients who developed dIVH. Significant associations of dIVH were prior warfarin anticoagulation, high (≥15) baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, larger (≥15 mL) ICH volume, greater ICH growth and higher achieved SBP over 24 h. Compared with those who were IVH-free, dIVH had greater odds of 90-day death or major disability versus initial IVH (adjusted ORs 2.84 (95% CI 1.52 to 5.28) and 1.87 (1.36 to 2.56), respectively (p trend <0.0001)).

This study attempts to describe the social behavior of people in poverty line toward COVID-19 case in Makassar. METHOD This research is a qualitative descriptive study based on the case. The data analysis was undertaken qualitatively. RESULTS The results revealed that the limited understanding of people in poverty line about COVID-19 and health protocols makes their behavior indifferent and disobedient to health protocols. In addition, the government's top-down approach to deal with COVID-19 pandemic was ineffective.

A seminal nonhuman primate challenge experiment suggested that complement was dispensable for the protective effect of the early broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) b12, but recent experiments have raised questions about the breadth of circumstances under which this conclusion may hold. Here, we reassess the original observation using Fc variants of IgG1 b12 that enhance complement activity and report that complement fixation on recombinant antigen, virions, and cells and complement-dependent viral and cellular lysis in vitro vary among bnAbs. Specifically, while the clinically significant V3 glycan-specific bnAb 10-1074 demonstrates activity, we found that b12 does not meaningfully activate the classical complement cascade. Consistent with avid engagement by C1q and its complex system of regulatory factors, these results suggest that complement-mediated antibody activities demonstrate a high degree of context dependence and motivate revisiting the role of complement in antibody-mediated prevention of HIV-1 infection by next-generation bnAbs in new translational studies in animal models. IMPORTANCE Given the suboptimal outcome of VRC01 antibody-mediated prevention of HIV-1 infection in its first field trial, means to improve diverse antiviral activities in vivo have renewed importance. This work revisits a loss-of-function experiment that investigated the mechanism of action of b12, a similar antibody, and finds that the reason why complement-mediated antiviral activities were not observed to contribute to protection may be the inherent lack of activity of wild-type b12, raising the prospect that this mechanism may contribute in the context of other HIV-specific antibodies.","Goldberg, Benjamin S; Kaku, Chengzi I; Dufloo, Jérémy; Bruel, Timothée; Schwartz, Olivier; Spencer, David A; Hessell, Ann J; Ackerman, Margaret E",mBio,86,30

OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that, among patients with symptomatic VB stenosis or occlusion, those with distal blood flow compromise as measured by large-vessel quantitative magnetic resonance angiography (QMRA) are at higher risk of subsequent posterior circulation stroke. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective, blinded, longitudinal cohort study was conducted at 5 academic hospital-based centers in the United States and Canada; 82 patients from inpatient and outpatient settings were enrolled. Participants with recent VB transient ischemic attack or stroke and 50% or more atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion in vertebral and/or basilar arteries underwent large-vessel flow measurement in the VB territory using QMRA. Physicians performing follow-up assessments were blinded to QMRA flow status. Follow-up included monthly telephone calls for 12 months and biannual clinical visits (for a minimum of 12 months, and up to 24 months or the final visit). Enrollment took place from July 1, 2008, to July 31, 2013, with study completion on June 30, 2014; data analysis was performed from October 1, 2014, to April 10, 2015. EXPOSURE Standard medical management of stroke risk factors. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was VB-territory stroke. RESULTS Of the 82 enrolled patients, 72 remained eligible after central review of their angiograms. Sixty-nine of 72 patients completed the minimum 12-month follow-up; median follow-up was 23 (interquartile range, 14-25) months. Distal flow status was low in 18 of the 72 participants (25%) included in the analysis and was significantly associated with risk for a subsequent VB stroke (P = .04), with 12- and 24-month event-free survival rates of 78% and 70%, respectively, in the low-flow group vs 96% and 87%, respectively, in the normal-flow group. The hazard ratio, adjusted for age and stroke risk factors, in the low distal flow status group was 11.55 (95% CI, 1.88-71.00; P = .008). Medical risk factor management at 6-month intervals was similar between patients with low and normal distal flow. Distal flow status remained significantly associated with risk even when controlling for the degree of stenosis and location. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Distal flow status determined using a noninvasive and practical imaging tool is robustly associated with risk for subsequent stroke in patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic VB occlusive disease. Identification of high-risk patients has important implications for future investigation of more aggressive interventional or medical therapies.","Amin-Hanjani, Sepideh; Pandey, Dilip K; Rose-Finnell, Linda; Du, Xinjian; Richardson, DeJuran; Thulborn, Keith R; Elkind, Mitchell S V; Zipfel, Gregory J; Liebeskind, David S; Silver, Frank L; Kasner, Scott E; Aletich, Victor A; Caplan, Louis R; Derdeyn, Colin P; Gorelick, Philip B; Charbel, Fady T",JAMA neurology,86,16

For its second project the NMGI chose to explore issues impacting on access and availability of radiopharmaceuticals around the world. Methods: Information was obtained by survey responses from 35 countries on available radioisotopes, radiopharmaceuticals and kits for diagnostic and therapeutic use. Issues impacting on access and availability of radiopharmaceuticals in individual countries were also identified. Results: Detailed information on radiopharmaceuticals utilized in each country, and sources of supply, was evaluated. Responses highlighted problems in access particularly due to the reliance on a sole provider, regulatory issues and reimbursement, as well as issues of facilities and workforce particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Conclusion: Strategies to address access and availability of radiopharmaceuticals are outlined, to enable timely and equitable patient access to nuclear medicine procedures worldwide.

Bilateral sinus floor augmentations were performed in 13 patients. Trephine bone cores were taken from the lateral window areas of 11 patients 6 to 8 months after augmentation for histologic and histomorphometric analysis. Bone samples from both the large and small particle size groups showed evidence of vital bone formation similar to that seen in previous studies, confirming the osteoconductivity of ABBM. Significant bone bridging was seen creating new trabeculae composed of the newly formed bone and residual ABBM particles. Histologic evaluation revealed the newly formed bone to be mostly woven bone with some remodeling to lamellar bone. Osteocytes were seen within the newly formed bone as well as osteoblast seams with recently formed osteoid. Isolated osteoclasts were observed on the ABBM surfaces. Vital bone formation (primary outcome measure) was more extensive in the large particle grafts compared with the small particle grafts (26.77% ± 9.63% vs 18.77% ± 4.74%, respectively). The histologic results reaffirm the osteoconductive ability of ABBM when used as the sole grafting material in maxillary sinus augmentation. The histomorphometric results at 6 to 8 months revealed a statistically significant increase (P = .02) in vital bone formation when the larger particle size was used. Additional studies should be performed to confirm these results.","Testori, Tiziano; Wallace, Stephen S; Trisi, Paolo; Capelli, Matteo; Zuffetti, Francesco; Del Fabbro, Massimo",The International journal of periodontics & restorative dentistry,86,17

PEDs are feasible for vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms (4); however, few reports discuss using PEDs to span the entire segment of the basilar artery.

The robot telescope and the first robotic arm were placed through a single 2-cm umbilical incision, and the second robotic arm was placed through the vagina. RESULTS All 30 R-NOTES procedures were performed successfully without any addition of laparoscopic port or open conversion. Mean length of the umbilical incision was 2.6 cm. Mean operative time was 154 minutes, and mean estimated total blood loss was 72 mL. Mean warm ischemia time in the partial nephrectomy group was 25.4 minutes. There were no intraoperative complications. There were no robotic system failures during the entire experiment.

Para-aortic lymphadenectomy was performed via the left-sided extraperitoneal approach by a 2- to 3-cm incision, which was made 1 cm above the usual incision to the left of McBurney's point. We used conventional instruments in all cases. RESULTS Three consecutive patients with cervical cancer had undergone a pretherapeutic laparoscopic staging procedure (1 stage IB2 and 2 stage IIB). The histologic types were squamous carcinoma (n = 2) and adenocarcinoma (n = 1). No patients had pelvic or para-aortic uptakes on preoperative positron emission tomography computed tomography imaging. The mean operative time was 223 minutes (range, 210-250 minutes). The mean number of lymph nodes removed was 19 (range, 15-23). The definitive pathological analysis had revealed that one patient had metastatic disease. No failures occurred with the single-port procedure, and no conversion to conventional multiport laparoscopy was reported. CONCLUSIONS This preliminary series reports on the feasibility of the para-aortic lymphadenectomy technique via the extraperitoneal approach with a multichannel single port using conventional instruments. Nevertheless, the safety of this procedure (compared to conventional laparoscopic approach) needs to be explored in a further larger study.","Gouy, Sébastien; Uzan, Catherine; Kane, Aminata; Gauthier, Tristan; Morice, Philippe",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,86,1

AIMS We aimed to assess this postoperative activity using capsule endoscopy (CE) and analyze the association between treatment optimization based on CE findings and the long-term course. METHODS In patients who underwent intestinal resection, we performed CE and assessed the endoscopic activity using the Lewis score within 3 months postoperatively (1st CE) and during follow-up. Postoperative treatments were adjusted according to clinical symptoms or CE findings (severity of 1st CE or worsening of follow-up CEs). Hospitalization, repeat surgery, or endoscopic dilation defined the primary outcome. RESULTS Among the CE group (N = 48), 85.7% (1st CE) and 79.2% (2nd CE) exhibited endoscopic activities indicating residual or recurrent lesions. Postoperative treatments were adjusted according to clinical symptoms in the non-CE group (N = 57) and clinical symptoms or CE findings in the CE group. Compared to the non-CE group, the CE group had significantly fewer primary outcomes. Patients with treatment adjustments based on CE findings had even lower primary outcome rate. Multivariate analysis identified the CE group as an independent protective factor (hazard ratio = 0.45, 95% confidence interval = 0.20-0.96). Treatment adjustments based on CE findings showed a stronger protective effect (0.30, 0.10-0.75). CONCLUSIONS Postoperative repeated CE enabled us to assess residual and recurrent lesions accurately before clinical symptoms appeared. The regular assessment of endoscopic activity and subsequent treatment optimization have the potential for improving postoperative course.","Shiga, Hisashi; Abe, Izuru; Kusaka, Jun; Shimoyama, Yusuke; Moroi, Rintaro; Kuroha, Masatake; Kakuta, Yoichi; Kinouchi, Yoshitaka; Masamune, Atsushi",Digestive diseases and sciences,86,1

Previous multi-omic data have implied that the pathogenesis of WB is associated with the activation of immune system and inflammatory response. However, the intricate mechanisms are not fully understood. This study was therefore conducted to systematically investigate the morphology, expression of cytokines as well as the underlying signaling pathways regulating the inflammatory response in pectoralis major (PM) muscle of WB myopathic broilers. RESULTS Histopathological changes, increased plasma creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities, elevated myeloperoxidase activity and overproduction of nitric oxide in muscle indicated the enhancement of muscle damage and inflammation in WB broilers. The mRNA expressions of inflammatory cytokines were dysregulated in PM muscle and contents of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α were increased in serum of WB myopathic broilers, indicating this myopathy was associated with immune disorder and systemic inflammation response. Additionally, toll-like receptors (TLRs) levels were upregulated, the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway was activated and the mRNA expression levels of downstream inflammatory mediators were enhanced in PM muscle of WB myopathy affected birds. CONCLUSION The results indicated an immune disorder and a systemic inflammation response in WB myopathic broilers, which might be related to a synergetic effect of TLRs and NF-κB pathway.

METHOD Online databases were searched on 31 March 2019 in order to identify studies comparing HOMA-IR, serum adiponectin, leptin and resistin levels between patients with SLE and controls. A random-effects model was adopted. RESULTS Fifty-six studies involving a total of 4460 patients with SLE were included. Patients with SLE had significantly higher HOMA-IR values (standardized mean difference (SMD)=0.425; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.156-0.693; I2=93.8%) than the control group. The serum levels of adiponectin (SMD=0.547; 95% CI 0.219-0.874; I2=90.1%), leptin (SMD=0.843; 95% CI 0.454-1.231; I2=94.4%) and resistin (SMD=0.856; 95% CI 0.199-1.513; I2=96.6%) were all higher among patients with SLE than controls.

The dynamic changes of airflow rate and the breathing resistance were acquired by a virtual instrument (VI) system and a microelectronics system. Six evaluation indices were defined for the dynamic performance and comfort sensation of face mask, derived from the source data of dynamic breathing resistance. Twelve types of face masks from different department stores with different features such as shape, respiratory valve, brand, main materials and protection level were tested using the experimental set-up. The one-way ANOVA analysis was carried out to identify the significance of the differences of the indices among the test masks. The results showed that each evaluation index was significantly different (P < 0.05) among different test masks. The change rate of breathing resistance could be obtained using the dynamic measurement of breathing resistance and could be applied for the dynamic performance evaluation of face mask compared with the static measurement of breathing resistance under constant airflow rate. The influences of structural features such as respiratory valve, shape and main materials on breathing resistance were evaluated and analyzed. The face masks with respiratory valve had lower change rate of breathing resistance. Moreover, the cup type mask had lower change rate of breathing resistance than the folding mask. Furthermore, the cotton mask had lower change rate of breathing resistance than the nonwoven fabric mask.","Yao, Bao-Guo; Wang, Yu-Xiao; Ye, Xiang-Yu; Zhang, Fei; Peng, Yun-Liang",The Science of the total environment,86,31

METHODS This paper proposes a local region-based variational region growing algorithm, which integrates local region and shape prior to segment the mandible accurately. Firstly, we select initial seeds in the CBCT image and then calculate candidate point sets and the local region energy function of each point. If a point reduces the energy, it is selected to be a pixel of the foreground region. By multiple iterations, the mandible segmentation of the slice can be obtained. Secondly, the segmented result of the previous slice is adopted as the shape prior to the next slice until all of the slices in CBCT are segmented. At last, the final mandible model is reconstructed by the Marching Cubes algorithm. RESULTS The experimental results on CBCT datasets illustrate the LRVRG algorithm can obtain satisfied 3D mandible models from CBCT images and it can solve the fuzzy problem effectively. Furthermore, quantitative comparisons with other methods demonstrate the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in mandible segmentation. CONCLUSIONS Experiments demonstrate that our method is efficient and accurate for the mandible model segmentation.","Jiang, Yankai; Qian, Jiahong; Lu, Shijuan; Tao, Yubo; Lin, Jun; Lin, Hai",Oral radiology,86,29

RECENT FINDINGS Overdose due to illicit synthetic opioids (e.g. fentanyl and fentanyl analogs) continues to rise in the US both preceding and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fentanyl-related overdose is rising in new geographic areas e.g. the western USA. Stimulant-related overdose is also increasing nationwide driven by methamphetamine and cocaine. Polysubstance use, e.g. the use of a stimulant along with an opioid is driving stimulant-related overdose. Other medical consequences of injection drug use are rising including HIV and hepatitis C infections. Medication approaches to treating opioid use disorder remain the standard of care and there are new promising pharmacological approaches to treating methamphetamine use disorder. SUMMARY A 'fourth wave' of high mortality involving methamphetamine and cocaine use has been gathering force in the USA. Availability and use of illicit fentanyls are still the major drivers of overdose deaths and the current rise in stimulant-related deaths appears entwined with the ongoing opioid epidemic.","Ciccarone, Daniel",Current opinion in psychiatry,86,1

Our goal was to evaluate whether the new-generation, Three-Dimensional Laparoscopic Vision System (3D LVS) provides greater benefit in terms of execution time and error number during the performance of surgical tasks. METHODS This study tests the hypothesis that the use of the new generation 3D LVS can significantly improve technical ability on complex laparoscopic tasks in an experimental model. Twenty-four participants (8 experienced, 8 minimally experienced, and 8 inexperienced) were evaluated for 10 different tasks in terms of total execution time and error number. The 4-point lickert scale was used for subjective assessment of the two imaging modalities. RESULTS All tasks were completed by all participants. Statistically significant difference was determined between 3D and 2D systems in the tasks of bead transfer and drop, suturing, and pick-and-place in the inexperienced group; in the task of passing through two circles with the needle in the minimally experienced group; and in the tasks of bead transfer and drop, suturing and passing through two circles with the needle in the experienced group. Three-dimensional imaging was preferred over 2D in 6 of the 10 subjective criteria questions on 4-point lickert scale. CONCLUSIONS The majority of the tasks were completed in a shorter time using 3D LVS compared to 2D LVS. The subjective Likert-scale ratings from each group also demonstrated a clear preference for 3D LVS. New 3D LVS has the potential to improve the learning curve, and reduce the operating time and error rate during the performances of laparoscopic surgeons.

Here, PM2.5 was monitored and collected in central China, and its cytotoxicity mechanism on human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) was investigated. With the average concentration of 109 ± 69 μg/m3, PM2.5 was rich in heavy metals and organic pollutants. After exposure to PM2.5, the viability of BEAS-2B cells decreased, where 510 dysregulated genes were predicted to induce necroptosis via inhibiting ATP synthesis through the oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway. Cellular experiments demonstrated that the content of ATP was downregulated, while the expression of RIP3, a necroptosis indicator, was upregulated. Besides, four enzymes in charge of ATP synthesis were downregulated, including ATP5F, NDUF, COX7A, and UQCR, while two genes of RELA and CAPN1 responsible for necroptosis were upregulated. Furthermore, N-acetylcysteine was applied as an enhancer for ATP synthesis, which reversed the downregulation of ATP5F, NDUF, and COX7A, and consequently alleviated the elevation of RELA, CAPN1, and RIP3. In conclusion, PM2.5 exposure downregulates ATP5F, NDUF, COX7A, and UQCR, and that inhibits ATP synthesis via the oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway, which subsequently upregulates RELA and CAPN1 and ultimately leads to necroptosis of BEAS-2B cells.","Duan, Shuyin; Zhang, Meihua; Sun, Yaqiong; Fang, Zhenya; Wang, Hefeng; Li, Shuxian; Peng, Yanze; Li, Juan; Li, Junxia; Tian, Jiaqi; Yin, Haoyu; Yao, Sanqiao; Zhang, Lin",Journal of hazardous materials,86,1

At the same time, ACT is necessary for patients with AF, since anticoagulants effectively reduces the risk of ischemic stroke. To make a decision on the appointment of ACT, it is necessary to correlate the risks of ischemic stroke and bleeding, this requires knowledge of current clinical using ACT recommendations and instructions. Among patients admitted to hospital, 30% receive ACT, so increasing adherence to clinical recommendations for prescribing AC to patients with AF by doctors of various profiles is an urgent task. AIM To analyze the adherence of physicians to recommendations for prescribing ACT before and after the introduction of decision support system (DSS) in patients with AF in a multi-specialty hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS A single-center non-randomized study with historical control to assess adherence to recommendations based on the analysis of medical prescriptions and the structure of drug errors in patients with AF in a multi-specialty hospital in Moscow before and after the introduction of DSS. Compliance with the recommendations of physicians was evaluated in the sections indications /contraindications to AC and dosage regimen of AC. The presence of deviations from the clinical recommendations /instructions for medical use of AC was regarded as management of the patient with non-compliance with recommendations. Physicians adherence level to recommendations was calculated as the ratio of cases of compliance with recommendations to the total number of cases. RESULTS In the control and experimental groups, there was a significant increase in the proportion of POAC at discharge in comparison with admission to hospital: from 54.5 to 76.8% (p=0.0005) and from 63 to 85.7% (p=0.0002), respectively. However, only in the experimental group it was possible to significantly reduce the number of patients without a prescribed ACT (if there are indications) from 7.6 to 1% (p=0.04) in comparison with admission. During the study, it was possible to significantly increase physicians adherence level to the recommendations for the AC dosage regimen in patients with AF from 59% (44 discrepancies for 107 prescriptions) to 84.6% (16 discrepancies for 104 prescriptions); p0.005. Before the introduction of the DSS, the analysis of drug prescriptions revealed 56 drug errors (0.5 errors per patient), after the introduction of the DSS, the number of drug errors significantly decreased to 21 (0.2 errors per patient); p0.05. After the introduction of DSS, the number of sub-therapeutic doses of AC was reduced from 31 (27.7%) to 8 (7.6%); p0.05. CONCLUSION The level of adherence to the recommendations for prescribing ACT to patients with AF in the hospital is high. The use of DSS increases the level of adherence to the recommendations on the AC dosage regimen in patients with AF, as well as eliminates errors in calculating the risk of ischemic stroke and systemic thromboembolic complications, and contributes to reducing the frequency of prescribing sub-therapeutic doses of AC.","Chernov, A A; Kleymenova, E B; Sychev, D A; Yashina, L P; Nigmatkulova, M D; Otdelenov, V A; Payushchik, S A",Terapevticheskii arkhiv,86,15

The secondary aim of the study was to compare the radiologic findings with clinical and laboratory data. METHODS Patients with COVID-19 who underwent chest computed tomography (CT) between March 11, 2020 and April 15, 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. Clinical and laboratory findings of patients with abnormal findings on chest CT and PCR-evidence of COVID-19 infection were recorded. Visual quantitative assessment score (VQAS) was performed according to the extent of lung opacities. Software-based quantitative assessment of the normal lung parenchyma percentage (SQNLP) was automatically quantified by a deep learning software. The presence of consolidation and crazy paving pattern (CPP) was also recorded. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the correlation between quantitative radiologic assessments, and clinical and laboratory findings, as well as to determine the predictive utility of radiologic findings for estimating severe pneumonia and admission to intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS A total of 90 patients were enrolled. Both VQAS and SQNLP were significantly correlated with multiple clinical parameters. While VQAS >8.5 (sensitivity, 84.2%; specificity, 80.3%) and SQNLP <82.45% (sensitivity, 83.1%; specificity, 84.2%) were related to severe pneumonia, VQAS >9.5 (sensitivity, 93.3%; specificity, 86.5%) and SQNLP <81.1% (sensitivity, 86.5%; specificity, 86.7%) were predictive of ICU admission. Both consolidation and CPP were more commonly seen in patients with severe pneumonia than patients with nonsevere pneumonia (P = 0.197 for consolidation; P < 0.001 for CPP). Moreover, the presence of CPP showed high specificity (97.2%) for severe pneumonia. CONCLUSION Both SQNLP and VQAS were significantly related to the clinical findings, highlighting their clinical utility in predicting severe pneumonia, ICU admission, length of hospital stay, and management of the disease. On the other hand, presence of CPP has high specificity for severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","Durhan, Gamze; Ardalı Düzgün, Selin; Başaran Demirkazık, Figen; Irmak, İlim; İdilman, İlkay; Gülsün Akpınar, Meltem; Akpınar, Erhan; Öcal, Serpil; Telli, Gülçin; Topeli, Arzu; Arıyürek, Orhan Macit",Diagnostic and interventional radiology,86,27

In this study, we present our experience with the administration of a large-volume blood patch to multiple sites in the epidural space through a single-catheter access site. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension who underwent a large-volume blood patch to multiple sites in the epidural space through a single-catheter access site from 2010 to 2012. Patient demographic data, clinical charts, indications for treatment, radiographic images, procedure notes, and postprocedure hospital course were reviewed. RESULTS Overall, 9 patients were identified who underwent 20 blood patch procedures. Patients were selected to undergo the large-volume procedure either because they had a failed site-directed epidural blood patch or if imaging demonstrated multiple possible leak sites. There were 6 women and 3 men, with an average age of 33.5 years. The mean volume of blood injected per procedure was 54.1 mL (median=55 mL; range=38-70 mL). All patients had an orthostatic headache as one of their presenting symptoms; 22% also presented with neurocognitive decline and behavioral changes; 89% of patients had improvement or resolution of their symptoms; and 80% of patients who had a previously failed site-directed epidural blood or fibrin glue patch improved with a large volume catheter-directed blood patch. CONCLUSIONS Our experience supports the use of a large-volume blood patch to multiple sites in the epidural space through a single-catheter access site for the treatment of spontaneous intracranial hypotension.

METHODS The St. Elizabeth's Medical Center Institutional Review Board exempted the study from review (waived review). In each case, verbal informed consent was obtained by the study participant or health care proxy. RESULTS The majority of the patients undergoing surgery had low Society of Thoracic Surgeons score and uneventful operating time. The mortality was very high and driven primarily by the viral syndrome. Laboratory markers that have been associated with disease severity in the general population were also prognostic in our population. CONCLUSION Our study shows that these patients have very high mortality, whereas prevention and preoperative screening is required in preventing nosocomial spreading of the disease.","Katsiampoura, Anastasia; Perozo, Cesar; Varkaris, Andreas; Vellayappan, Sandhya; Tam, Ming Zhen; Vellayappan, Usha; Agnihotri, Arvind; Tam, Stanley",Journal of cardiac surgery,86,31

In our study, we aimed to evaluate the differences between the two main biological treatment groups and their effects on routine laboratory parameters. METHODS Patients were enrolled when they had received treatment for more than six months with biological treatments between January 2013 and April 2020. The available data on routine laboratory parameters were collected by routine blood tests before the treatment, at three months, and at the final evaluation. RESULTS When the changes in routine laboratory parameters were evaluated by treatment, it was found that the NLR and CRP values decreased statistically significantly in the anti-TNF group compared to the IL inhibitor group. In addition, strong suppression of these inflammation parameters means strong suppression of the immune system response. In addition, AST, ALT, and creatinine values were found to be statistically significantly higher in the anti-TNF group compared to the IL inhibitor group. CONCLUSION In our study, anti-TNF treatments are shown to be more effective in reducing inflammation parameters while IL antagonists are safer in terms of biochemical parameters.","Ataseven, Arzu; Temiz, Selami Aykut; Eren, Güllü; Özer, İlkay; Dursun, Recep",The Journal of dermatological treatment,86,22

There is only limited data on neotropical bat CoVs. We analysed faecal, blood and intestine specimens from 1562 bats sampled in Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador and Brazil for CoVs by broad-range PCR. CoV RNA was detected in 50 bats representing nine different species, both frugivorous and insectivorous. These bat CoVs were unrelated to known human or animal pathogens, indicating an absence of recent zoonotic spill-over events. Based on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)-based grouping units (RGUs) as a surrogate for CoV species identification, the 50 viruses represented five different alphacoronavirus RGUs and two betacoronavirus RGUs. Closely related alphacoronaviruses were detected in Carollia perspicillata and C. brevicauda across a geographical distance exceeding 5600 km. Our study expands the knowledge on CoV diversity in neotropical bats and emphasizes the association of distinct CoVs and bat host genera.","Corman, Victor Max; Rasche, Andrea; Diallo, Thierno Diawo; Cottontail, Veronika M; Stöcker, Andreas; Souza, Breno Frederico de Carvalho Dominguez; Corrêa, Jefferson Ivan; Carneiro, Aroldo José Borges; Franke, Carlos Roberto; Nagy, Martina; Metz, Markus; Knörnschild, Mirjam; Kalko, Elisabeth K V; Ghanem, Simon J; Morales, Karen D Sibaja; Salsamendi, Egoitz; Spínola, Manuel; Herrler, Georg; Voigt, Christian C; Tschapka, Marco; Drosten, Christian; Drexler, Jan Felix",The Journal of general virology,86,1

The aim of this review is to give an overview of interventions applied in primary care to optimize the use of laboratory tests. A search for studies was made in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. We also extracted studies from two previous reviews published in 2015. Studies were included if they described application of an intervention aiming to optimize the use of laboratory tests. We also evaluated the overall risk of bias of the studies. We included 24 studies. The interventions were categorized as: education, feedback reports and computerized physician order entry (CPOE) strategies. Most of the studies were classified as medium or high risk of bias while only three studies were evaluated as low risk of bias. The majority of the studies aimed at reducing the number of tests, while four studies investigated interventions aiming to increase the use of specific tests. Despite the studies being heterogeneous, we made results comparable by transforming the results into weighted relative changes in number of tests when necessary. Education changed the number of tests consistently, and these results were supported by the low risk of bias of the papers. Feedback reports have mainly been applied in combination with education, while when used alone the effect was minimal. The use of CPOE strategies seem to produce a marked change in the number of test requests, however the studies were of medium or high risk of bias.","Lillo, Serena; Larsen, Trine Rennebod; Pennerup, Leif; Antonsen, Steen",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,86,1

The volume of TVIAs and the required length of coils were calculated by the AngioSuite software before embolization. The treatment efficacy of TVIAs was assessed using the Raymond scale (Rs) and the modified Rankin scale (mRs). Results Of the 34 aneurysms with an average volume of 7.16 mm3, 13 aneurysms were treated with sole coil embolization, 19 by stent-assisted embolization, and 2 by balloon-assisted embolization. The average coil length was 5.32 cm, and the average packing density was 41.21%. The immediate DSA showed that total occlusion (Rs = 1) was achieved in 15 aneurysms, subtotal (Rs = 2) in 9, and partial (Rs = 3) in 11. Total occlusion was achieved in 30 aneurysms and subtotal in the other 4 aneurysms at 6-month follow-up. Baseline volume and diameter of aneurysms were significantly correlated with the coil length (r = 0.801, P < 0.001; r = 0.711, P < 0.001). Conclusions Coil embolization of TVIAs was easy to achieve high packing density. According to the data from AngioSuite, relative few coils can increase the safety in procedure and stenting may reduce risk of aneurysmal recurrence.","Du, Zhihua; Lv, Bin; Cao, Xiangyu; Liu, Xinfeng; Zhang, Rongju; Su, Hui; Wang, Jun",BioMed research international,86,24

However, multivariate empirical studies investigating its determinants are still limited. We document variation in COVID-19 case and death rates across different racial/ethnic neighbourhoods in New York City (NYC), the initial epicentre of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, and conduct a multivariate ecological analysis investigating how various neighbourhood characteristics might explain any observed disparities. METHODS Using ZIP-code-level COVID-19 case and death data from the NYC Department of Health, demographic and socioeconomic data from the American Community Survey and health data from the Centers for Disease Control's 500 Cities Project, we estimated a series of negative binomial regression models to assess the relationship between neighbourhood racial/ethnic composition (majority non-Hispanic White, majority Black, majority Hispanic and Other-type), neighbourhood poverty, affluence, proportion of essential workers, proportion with pre-existing health conditions and neighbourhood COVID-19 case and death rates. RESULTS COVID-19 case and death rates for majority Black, Hispanic and Other-type minority communities are between 24% and 110% higher than those in majority White communities. Elevated case rates are completely accounted for by the larger presence of essential workers in minority communities but excess deaths in Black neighbourhoods remain unexplained in the final model. CONCLUSIONS The unequal COVID-19 case burden borne by NYC's minority communities is closely tied to their representation among the ranks of essential workers. Higher levels of pre-existing health conditions are not a sufficient explanation for the elevated mortality burden observed in Black communities.","Do, D Phuong; Frank, Reanne",Journal of epidemiology and community health,86,1

In our study, we aimed to reveal that COVID-19 infection affects the endocrine system and triggers subacute thyroiditis (SAT) in the acute period. MATERIAL AND METHOD In our retrospective study, the ear-nose-throat examination, internal diseases consultation (investigation of COVID-19 symptoms and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] test), routine blood tests, T3, T4, thyroid-stimulating hormone, antithyroglobulin (anti-TG), antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO), thyroid scintigraphy, and thyroid ultrasonography results of 5 patients who applied to the otorhinolaryngology clinic due to complaints of neck pain and odynophagia between April 2020 and February 2021 were examined. FINDINGS All 5 patients were female patients (30.4 years) with odynophagia and pain in the front lower region of the neck. These patients had no previous history of thyroiditis. COVID-19 PCR tests of the patients diagnosed with SAT were positive, and there were no typical COVID-19 signs and symptoms except odynophagia and neck pain. RESULT It comes in view that SARS-COV-2 affects thyroid functions and causes SAT and the main symptoms in patients are pain in the neck and odynophagia.","Seyed Resuli, Ali; Bezgal, Muzaffer","Ear, nose, & throat journal",86,28

Research from high income countries has found many challenges associated with the meaningful implementation of CE in practice, but this has been underexplored in LIMCS and in South East Asia (SEA) in particular. Methods We completed a realist synthesis and systematic review of peer reviewed publications and grey literature to identify the context and actions which promote successful implementation of CE approaches in SEA. We used a theory-driven approach-realist synthesis-to analyse data and develop context-mechanism-outcome configurations that can be used to explain how civic engagement approaches operate in South East Asian contexts. We worked closely with patient and public representatives to guide the review from the outset. Results Fifty-seven published and unpublished articles were included, 24 were evaluations of CE, including two Randomized Controlled Trials. The majority of CE interventions featured uptake or adaptation of Western models of care. We identified important cultural differences in the enactment of civic engagement in SEA contexts and four mechanisms which, alongside their contextual barriers and facilitators, can be used to explain how civic engagement produces a range of outcomes for people experiencing mental health problems, their families and communities. Our review illustrates how CE interventions can be successfully implemented in SEA, however Western models should be adapted to fit with local cultures and values to promote successful implementation. Barriers to implementation included distrust of services/outside agencies, stigma, paternalistic cultures, limited resource and infrastructure. Conclusion Our findings provide guidance for the implementation of CE approaches within SEA contexts and identify areas for further research. Due to the collectivist nature of many SEA cultures, and the impact of shared traumas on community mental health, CE might best be implemented at community level, with a focus on relational decision making.Registration This review is registered on PROSPERO: CRD42018087841.","James, Karen; Brooks, Helen; Susanti, Herni; Waddingham, Jessica; Irmansyah, Irman; Keliat, Budi-Anna; Utomo, Bagus; Rose, Diana; Colucci, Erminia; Lovell, Karina",International journal of mental health systems,86,28

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 221 patients with locally recurrent thyroid cancers who underwent either RFA (n = 96) or repeat surgery (n = 125) between March 2008 and March 2017 were retrospectively enrolled (range of follow-up, 1-10 years). Each cohort consisted of 70 patients after propensity score adjustment. Patients with more than three recurrent lesions were excluded. The primary and secondary end points were recurrence-free survival and complication rates, respectively. Recurrence-free survival curves were compared via the log-rank test. The complications-voice changes, hypocalcemia, and immediate procedural complications-were compared between the groups. In addition, pretreatment serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels and those at the last follow-up were also compared between the two groups to examine therapeutic efficacy. RESULTS After propensity score matching, both groups showed no significant differences in baseline characteristics. The recurrence-free survival rates were comparable between the RFA and surgery groups (p = .2). There were no significant differences in mean serum Tg levels and their mean decrease after treatment between the groups (p = .891 and p = .963, respectively). Immediate procedural complications and voice changes also showed no significant between-group differences (p = .316, p = .084, respectively). Hypocalcemia occurred only in the repeat surgery group (n = 18). Overall complications were significantly more frequent in the repeat surgery group (RFA, n = 7; surgery, n = 27; p < .001). CONCLUSION RFA may be an effective and safe alternative to repeat surgery in the treatment of a small number of locally recurrent thyroid cancers.","Choi, Yangsean; Jung, So Lyung; Bae, Ja-Sung; Lee, So-Hee; Jung, Chan-Kwon; Jang, Jinhee; Shin, Na-Young; Choi, Hyun Seok; Ahn, Kook-Jin; Kim, Bum-Soo","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",86,16

Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to further investigate whether TNF-α variants are related to AKI susceptibility. Methods A comprehensive search of observational studies on the association of TNF-α polymorphism with AKI susceptibility was conducted in the PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases through February 10, 2020. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% corresponding confidence intervals (95% CIs) were analyzed to evaluate the strength of the relationship. Results A total of 8 studies involving 6694 patients (2559 cases and 4135 controls) were included. Pooled analysis showed a trend of increased risk between the TNF-α rs1800629 variant and AKI (A vs. G: OR [95%CI] = 1.33 [0.98-1.81]) among the overall population. Ethnicity-stratified analysis indicated that the TNF-α rs1800629 variant was a risk factor for Asians (OR [95%CI] = 1.93 [1.59-2.35]) while it is not for Caucasians (OR [95%CI] = 1.04 [0.91-1.20]). Additionally, we also found that TNF-α rs1799964 polymorphism was observed to have a significant relationship with AKI risk in Asian patients (C vs. T, OR [95%CI] = 1.26 [1.11-1.43]). Conclusions The TNF rs1800629 polymorphism exhibited a trend toward AKI susceptibility with ethnic differences. The relationship was found to be significant among the Asian population, but not among those of Caucasian origin. Additionally, the TNF-α rs1799964 polymorphism was also related to a significantly increased risk of AKI in Asians.","Chen, Guanzhong; Liu, Bowen; Li, Huanqiang; Mai, Ziling; Zhang, Liyao; Li, Min; Liu, Liwei; Chen, Shiqun; Chen, Jiyan; Liu, Yong",BioMed research international,86,1

To overcome such barriers and enable greater access to basic and specialist care, developments in information and communication technologies are being applied. The focus of this scoping review is on web-based therapeutic interventions (WBTI) that aim to provide guidance, support and treatment for health problems. OBJECTIVES This review identifies and describes international scientific evidence on WBTI used by Indigenous peoples in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and USA for managing and treating a broad range of health conditions. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Studies assessing WBTI designed for Indigenous peoples in Australia, Canada, USA and New Zealand, that were published in English, in peer-reviewed literature, from 2006 to 2018 (inclusive), were considered for inclusion in the review. Studies were considered if more than 50% of participants were Indigenous, or if results were reported separately for Indigenous participants. SOURCES OF EVIDENCE Following a four-step search strategy in consultation with a research librarian, 12 databases were searched with a view to finding both published and unpublished studies. CHARTING METHODS Data was extracted, synthesised and reported under four main conceptual categories: (1) types of WBTI used, (2) community uptake of WBTI, (3) factors that impact on uptake and (4) conclusions and recommendations for practice. RESULTS A total of 31 studies met the inclusion criteria. The WBTI used were interactive websites, screening and assessment tools, management and monitoring tools, gamified avatar-based psychological therapy and decision support tools. Other sources reported the use of mobile apps, multimedia messaging or a mixture of intervention tools. Most sources reported moderate uptake and improved health outcomes for Indigenous people. Suggestions to improve uptake included as follows: tailoring content and presentation formats to be culturally relevant and appropriate, customisable and easy to use. CONCLUSIONS Culturally appropriate, evidence-based WBTI have the potential to improve health, overcome treatment barriers and reduce inequalities for Indigenous communities. Access to WBTI, alongside appropriate training, allows health care workers to better support their Indigenous clients. Developing WBTI in partnership with Indigenous communities ensures that these interventions are accepted and promoted by the communities.","Reilly, Rachel; Stephens, Jacqueline; Micklem, Jasmine; Tufanaru, Catalin; Harfield, Stephen; Fisher, Ike; Pearson, Odette; Ward, James",Systematic reviews,86,1

The pathological process of OA is complex and characterized by the imbalance between the synthesis and catabolism of chondrocytes and extracellular matrix, leading to the progressive destruction of articular cartilage damage. Because of the self-renewal and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), various exogenous MSC-based cell therapies have been developed to treat OA. Moreover, the efficacy of MSC- based therapy is mainly attributed to the paracrine of cytokines, growth factors, and exosomes. Exosomes derived from MSCs can deliver various DNAs, RNAs, proteins and lipids, thus promoting MSCs migration and cartilage repair. Therefore, MSC-derived exosomes are considered as a promising alternative therapy for OA. In this review, we summarized properties of MSC-derived exosomes and the new role of MSC-derived exosomes in the treatment of OA. We also proposed possible perspectives of MSC-derived exosomes as cell-free regenerative reagents in the treatment of OA.","Bao, Chuncha; He, Chengqi",Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,86,7

Six plots of a susceptible wheat cultivar were planted at Cuatro Cañadas (CC), Okinawa 1 (OK1), and Okinawa 2 (OK2) in 2015. Spike blast incidence (INC) and severity (SEV) and leaf blast severity (LEAF) were quantified in each plot at regular intervals on a 10 × 10 grid (n = 100 clusters of spikes), beginning at head emergence (Feekes growth stage 10.5), for a total of nine assessments at CC, six at OK1, and six at OK2. Spike blast increased over time for 20 to 30 days before approaching a mean INC of 100% and a mean SEV of 60 to 75%. The logistic model was the most appropriate for describing the temporal dynamics of spike blast. The highest absolute rates of disease increase occurred earliest at OK1 and latest at OK2, and in all cases it coincided with major rain events. Estimated y0 values (initial blast intensity) were significantly (P < 0.05) higher at OK1 than at CC or OK2, whereas rL values (the logistic rate parameter) were significantly higher at OK2 than at CC or OK1. It took about 10 fewer days for SEV to reach 10, 15, or 20% at OK1 compared with OK2 and CC. Based on survival analyses, the survivor functions for time to 10, 15 and 20% SEV (ts) were significantly different between OK1 and the other locations, with the probabilities of SEV reaching the thresholds being highest at OK1. LEAF at 21 days after Feekes 10.5 had a significant effect on ts at OK1. For every 5% increase in LEAF, the chance of SEV reaching the thresholds by day 21 increased by 30 to 55%.","Mills, Karasi B; Salgado, Jorge D; Cruz, Christian D; Valent, Barbara; Madden, Laurence V; Paul, Pierce A",Plant disease,86,17

At 1 and 2 years, clinical follow-up was available in 99.8% and patient-reported chest pain data in 94.1% and 93.6%, respectively. RESULTS Among all 3,202 patients, the 871 (27.2%) women were older (67.5 ± 10.2 years vs. 62.8 ± 10.6 years; p < 0.001) and had more cardiovascular risk factors: diabetes (24.2% vs. 17.8%; p < 0.001), hypertension (63.6% vs. 51.6%; p < 0.001), and positive family history (54.5% vs. 50.1%; p = 0.03). At 1- and 2-year follow-up, women reported more clinically relevant chest pain (16.3% vs. 10.5%; p < 0.001, and 17.2% vs. 11.1%; p < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that female sex independently predicted clinically relevant chest pain at 1- and 2-year follow-up both during daily activities and at minimum physical exertion/at rest (1 year adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2 to 2.4; p = 0.002; and adjusted OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.3 to 2.5; p < 0.001; 2-year adjusted OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.3 to 2.6; p < 0.001; and adjusted OR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.3 to 2.3; p = 0.001). Nevertheless, the 2-year rates of death, myocardial infarction, revascularization, stent thrombosis, and various composite clinical endpoints were similar for both sexes. CONCLUSIONS Although the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events was low and similar for both sexes, women showed a statistically significantly higher prevalence of clinically relevant chest pain, which might be largely related to mechanisms other than epicardial coronary obstruction.","Kok, Marlies M; van der Heijden, Liefke C; Sen, Hanim; Danse, Peter W; Löwik, Marije M; Anthonio, Rutger L; Louwerenburg, J Hans W; de Man, Frits H A F; Linssen, Gerard C M; IJzerman, Maarten J; Doggen, Carine J M; Maas, Angela H E M; Mehran, Roxana; von Birgelen, Clemens",JACC.

Differences in surgical outcomes between Vicryl figure-of-8 and V-Loc barbed sutures for vaginal cuff closure during robotic hysterectomy were assessed. METHODS We examined the electronic medical records of 202 patients who underwent scheduled robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign indications, without concomitant urogynecologic procedures, between January 2008 and November 2010 at the Henry Ford Health System academic medical center. Cuff closure approach was selected by the surgeon. Data on demographics, vaginal cuff suture type, body mass index (BMI), estimated blood loss (EBL), perioperative hemoglobin change, procedure duration, hospital length of stay (LOS), specimen weight, and postoperative complications were obtained. RESULTS The average age was 46 y (SD = 8.0 y). Women with Vicryl figure-of-8 closures (n = 133) were more likely than women with V-Loc barbed suture closures (n = 69) to have had a LOS > 1 d (48/133, 36.1% vs. 12/69, 17.4%; chi square P < .006), greater EBL (median 75 vs. 50 mL, Wilcoxon Rank Sum WRS P < .001), and longer procedure durations (175 vs. 135 min, WRS P < .001). These differences persisted even after considering uterine weight, BMI, smoking status, and concomitant oophorectomy. No differences with respect to the frequency of major (2 in each closure type) or minor complications were observed (P < .36). CONCLUSIONS There were no differences in complications between the Vicryl figure-of-8 and V-Loc barbed sutures in our sample. However, the latter had lower EBL and shorter procedure duration and LOS.","Nawfal, A Karim; Eisenstein, David; Theoharis, Evan; Dahlman, Marisa; Wegienka, Ganesa",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,86,1

However, owing to the soft inorganic lattice of these materials, the intense emission is barely retained under ambient conditions, thus largely limiting their practical applications in optoelectronics at atmospheric pressure. Here, remarkably enhanced emission in microtubules of the 0D hybrid halide (C5 H7 N2 )2 ZnBr4 ((4AMP)2 ZnBr4 ) is successfully achieved by means of pressure treatment at room temperature. Notably, the emission, which is over ten times more intense than the emission in the initial state, is retained under ambient conditions upon the complete release of pressure. Furthermore, the pressure processing enables the tuning of ""sky blue light"" before compression to ""cool daylight"" with a remarkable quantum yield of 88.52% after decompression, which is of considerable interest for applications in next-generation lighting and displays. The irreversible electronic structural transition, induced by the steric hindrance with respect to complexly configurational organic molecules [4AMP], is highly responsible for the eventual retention of PIE and tuning of the color temperature. The findings represent a significant step toward the capture of PIE under ambient conditions, thus facilitating its potential solid-state lighting applications.","Zhao, Dianlong; Xiao, Guanjun; Liu, Zhun; Sui, Laizhi; Yuan, Kaijun; Ma, Zhiwei; Zou, Bo",Advanced materials,86,17

Locales in which efforts were undertaken to encourage distancing experienced reductions in their rate of transmission. However, these aggregate results tell us little about the effectiveness of social distancing at the level of the individual, which is the question addressed by the current research. Four months after participating in a study assessing their social distancing behavior, 2,120 participants indicated whether they had contracted COVID-19. Importantly, the assessment of social distancing involved not only a self-report measure of how strictly participants had followed social distancing recommendations but also a series of virtual behavior measures of social distancing. These simulations presented participants with graphical depictions mirroring specific real-world scenarios, asking them to position themselves in relation to others in the scene. Individuals' social distancing behavior, particularly as assessed by the virtual behavior measure, predicted whether they contracted COVID-19 during the intervening 4 mo. This was true when considering only participants who reported having tested positively for the virus and when considering additional participants who, although untested, believed that they had contracted the virus. The findings offer a unique form of additional evidence as to why individuals should practice social distancing. What the individual does matters, not only for the health of the collective, but also for the specific individual.","Fazio, Russell H; Ruisch, Benjamin C; Moore, Courtney A; Granados Samayoa, Javier A; Boggs, Shelby T; Ladanyi, Jesse T",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,86,1

This double-blind, randomized controlled trial aimed to assess whether the consumption of lutein along with a low calorie diet (LCD) can influence anthropometric indices, body composition, and metabolic parameters in obese middle-aged individuals. After a 2-week run-in period with an LCD, 48 participants aged 45-65 y were randomly assigned to consume 20 mg/d lutein or placebo along with LCD for 10 weeks. Dietary intake, anthropometric indices, body composition, lipid profile, glucose homeostasis parameters, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), and appetite sensations were assessed at the beginning and end of the study. After 10 weeks, body weight, and waist circumference significantly decreased in both groups, although between-group differences were not significant. There was a more decrease in the percentage of body fat in the lutein group vs. the placebo group. Moreover, the placebo group experienced a significant reduction in fat free mass (FFM), whereas lutein group preserved FFM during calorie restriction, although between-group difference did not reach statistical significance. Visceral fat and serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were significantly decreased only in the lutein group, with a statistically significant difference between two arms only for TC. No significant changes were observed in the triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, glucose homeostasis parameters, NEFAs, and appetite sensations.

It has a high contagion rate and a course capable of rapidly lung involvement with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary insuficiency. Severe clinical picture develops as a result of a ""perfect cytokin storm"" as a result of possible immunological mechanisms triggered by viral infection. Immun system disregulation and possible autoinflammatory and autoimmune mechanisms are responsible for higher amount cytokines release from immune cells. Although there is no clear treatment of Covid-19 infection yet, it is argued that some disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be effective in addition to anti-viral treatments. These drugs (antimalarial drugs, colchicum dispert, biologics) have been well known to rheumatologists for years, because they have been used in the treatment of many inflammatory rheumatologic diseases, so now all eyes are on rheumatologists. Another important issue is whether DMARDs, which can cause severe immunosuppression, pose a risk for Covid-19 infection and whether they are discontinued beforehand. Although there are insufficient data on this subject, considering the risk of disease reactivation, patients may continue their DMARDs treatment under the supervision of the rheumatologist. In this article, the possible immunological mechanisms in the pathogenesis of Covid-19 infection and the efficacy and safety of various DMARDs used in the treatment have been discussed with a rheumatologist perspective in the light of recent literature data.","Kobak, Senol",Current rheumatology reviews,86,1

The authors evaluated the hypothesis that circulating-water leg wraps combined with a water mattress better maintain intraoperative core temperature ≥36°C than either forced-air warming or carbon-fiber resistive heating during major abdominal surgery. METHODS Thirty-six patients undergoing open abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to warming with: (1) circulating-water leg wraps combined with a full-length circulating-water mattress set at 42°C, (2) a lower-body forced-air cover set on high (≈43°C), and (3) a carbon-fiber resistive-heating cover set at 42°C. Patients were anesthetized with general anesthesia combined with continuous epidural analgesia. The primary outcome was intraoperative tympanic-membrane temperature ≥36°C. RESULTS In the 2 h after anesthesia induction, core temperature decreased 1.0 ± 0.5°C in the forced-air group, 0.9 ± 0.2°C in the carbon-fiber group, and 0.4 ± 0.4°C in the circulating-water leg wraps and mattress group (P < 0.05 vs. forced-air and carbon-fiber heating). At the end of surgery, core temperature was 0.2 ± 0.7°C above preoperative values in the circulating-water group but remained 0.6 ± 0.9°C less in the forced-air and 0.6 ± 0.4°C less in the carbon-fiber groups (P < 0.05 vs. carbon fiber). CONCLUSIONS The combination of circulating-water leg wraps and a mattress better maintain intraoperative core temperature than did forced-air and carbon-fiber warming systems.","Hasegawa, Kenji; Negishi, Chiharu; Nakagawa, Fumitoshi; Ozaki, Makoto",Journal of anesthesia,86,20

Cataract services suffered severe disruption due to necessary measures taken to reduce elective surgery in order to release capacity to support intensive care requirements. Faced with a potential 50% increase in cataract surgery workload per week in the post-COVID-19 world, eye units should use this event to innovate, not just survive but to also evolve for a sustainable future. In this article, we discuss the inadequacies of existing service rationing options to tackle the COVID-19 cataract backlog. This includes limiting rationing based on visual acuity, limiting surgery to first or only seeing eyes, and postponing clinic and surgical dates according to referral dates. We propose units use the lockdown time to reset and develop a comprehensive patient-centred care pathway using principles of value-based healthcare: the cataract integrated practice units. Developing an agile surgical database that incorporates all aspects of patient need from education to follow-up in their individual cataract journey will allow units to react and plan quickly in the early phase of recovery and beyond. We also discuss the considerations units should bear in mind on telemedicine, modifications for face-to-face clinics, theatre organisation and options of expanding cataract throughput capacity. The pause in elective surgery due to the pandemic may have provided cataract services a rare opportunity to reset and transform cataract service pathways for the digital era.","Lin, Pei-Fen; Naveed, Hasan; Eleftheriadou, Maria; Purbrick, Robert; Zarei Ghanavati, Mehran; Liu, Christopher",The British journal of ophthalmology,86,22

However, its effects on short- and long-term health outcomes and medical utilization are not fully elucidated. This study aimed to compare short- and long-term utilization and health outcomes of colon cancer patients who underwent either laparoscopic or open surgery in a population-based cohort. METHODS This study was conducted by linking data from Taiwan Cancer Registry, National Health Insurance claims and Death Registry. Patients aged 18 and older with colon cancer between 2009 and 2012 were included in the study. Propensity score matching was used to minimize selection bias between laparoscopic and open surgery groups. Cox proportional hazard regression and generalized linear mixed logistic regression were used to test hypotheses. RESULTS Among the 11,269 colon cancer patients who underwent colectomy, 3236 (28.72%) received laparoscopy and 8033 (71.28%) underwent open surgery. Patients who received laparoscopic surgery had better overall survival (HR = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.70-0.97). These patients also had lower 30 day mortality (0.44% vs. 0.91%), lower 1 year mortality (2.83% vs. 4.68%), lower overall occurrence of complications (6.16% vs. 8.77%), shorter mean length of stay (12.53 vs. 14.93 days) and lower cost for index hospitalization (US$4325.34 vs. US$4453.90). No significant differences were observed in medical utilization over a period of 365 days after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate that, in both the short- and long-term post-operation periods, laparoscopic surgery reduced the likelihood of postoperative complications, 30 day, and 1 year mortality while being no more expensive than open surgery for colon cancer.","Tan, Elise Chia-Hui; Yang, Ming-Chin; Chen, Chien-Chih",Current medical research and opinion,86,0

METHODS This systematic review searched Medline, EMBASE and LILACS (from inception to 25 May 2020) for studies on the quality of selected medicines available in LMIC that provided at least the amount of active pharmaceutical ingredient. We contacted study authors for additional information. We excluded simulation studies. We used the MEDQUARG tool to assess study quality. The main outcome was the prevalence of failed samples. FINDINGS We identified 9699 unique citations and included 34 studies (3159 samples from 40 countries) in the review. Most studies (65%) had low quality (scores <6/12). Overall, 48.9% of 1890 uterotonic samples (19 studies) failed quality tests; failures rates were 75% for ergometrine and nearly 40% each for oxytocin and misoprostol. The overall prevalence of failed injectable antibiotics (1090 samples, 18 studies) was 13.4%, ranging from 2.9% for injectable metronidazole (34 samples, 3 studies) to 16.0% for cefazolin (449 samples, 2 studies). The prevalence of low quality magnesium sulphate (179 samples, 2 studies) was 3.4%. We did not find any studies on the quality of carbetocin, tranexamic acid, or clindamycin.

Chest computed tomography (CT) and X-ray images have been well recognized to be two effective techniques for clinical COVID-19 disease diagnoses. Due to faster imaging time and considerably lower cost than CT, detecting COVID-19 in chest X-ray (CXR) images is preferred for efficient diagnosis, assessment, and treatment. However, considering the similarity between COVID-19 and pneumonia, CXR samples with deep features distributed near category boundaries are easily misclassified by the hyperplanes learned from limited training data. Moreover, most existing approaches for COVID-19 detection focus on the accuracy of prediction and overlook uncertainty estimation, which is particularly important when dealing with noisy datasets. To alleviate these concerns, we propose a novel deep network named RCoNetks for robust COVID-19 detection which employs Deformable Mutual Information Maximization (DeIM), Mixed High-order Moment Feature (MHMF), and Multiexpert Uncertainty-aware Learning (MUL). With DeIM, the mutual information (MI) between input data and the corresponding latent representations can be well estimated and maximized to capture compact and disentangled representational characteristics. Meanwhile, MHMF can fully explore the benefits of using high-order statistics and extract discriminative features of complex distributions in medical imaging. Finally, MUL creates multiple parallel dropout networks for each CXR image to evaluate uncertainty and thus prevent performance degradation caused by the noise in the data. The experimental results show that RCoNetks achieves the state-of-the-art performance on an open-source COVIDx dataset of 15,134 original CXR images across several metrics. Crucially, our method is shown to be more effective than existing methods with the presence of noise in the data.","Dong, Shunjie; Yang, Qianqian; Fu, Yu; Tian, Mei; Zhuo, Cheng",IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,86,1

METHODS The degree of BBB disruption on pretreatment MRI scans was analyzed, blinded to follow-up data, in the DEFUSE 2 cohort in which patients had endovascular therapy within 12 hours of stroke onset. BBB disruption was compared with ICH grade previously established by the DEFUSE 2 core lab. A prespecified threshold for predicting parenchymal hematoma (PH) was tested. RESULTS Of the 108 patients in the DEFUSE 2 trial, 100 had adequate imaging and outcome data and were included in this study; 24 developed PH. Increasing amounts of BBB disruption on pretreatment MRIs was associated with increasing severity of ICH grade (p = 0.004). BBB disruption on the pretreatment scan was associated with PH (p = 0.020) with an odds ratio for developing PH of 1.69 for each 10% increase in BBB disruption (95% confidence interval 1.09-2.64), although a reliably predictive threshold was not identified. CONCLUSIONS The amount of BBB disruption on pretreatment MRI is associated with the severity of ICH after acute intervention. This relationship has now been identified in patients receiving IV, endovascular, and combined therapies.

Second, because this conception leads to a promotion of solutions that are essentially based on the financialization and technoscientific management of the living world - precisely the underlying cause of the degradation of ecosystems and living conditions that created the Anthropocene in the first place.

METHODS During the 2010-2011 influenza season, subjects with influenza-like illness were enrolled in an emergency department and throughout a tertiary care hospital, nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained, and symptom severity, treatment, and medical history were recorded. Quantitative impaction air samples were taken not ≤0.305 m (1 foot), 0.914 m (3 feet), and 1.829 m (6 feet) from the patient's head during routine care. Influenza virus was detected by rapid test and polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS Sixty-one of 94 subjects (65%) tested positive for influenza virus. Twenty-six patients (43%) released influenza virus into room air, with 5 (19%) emitting up to 32 times more virus than others. Emitters surpassed the airborne 50% human infectious dose of influenza virus at all sample locations. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) were exposed to mainly small influenza virus particles (diameter, <4.7 µm), with concentrations decreasing with increasing distance from the patient's head (P < .05). Influenza virus release was associated with high viral loads in nasopharyngeal samples (shedding), coughing, and sneezing (P < .05). Patients who reported severe illness and major interference with daily life also emitted more influenza virus (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS HCPs within 1.829 m of patients with influenza could be exposed to infectious doses of influenza virus, primarily in small-particle aerosols. This finding questions the current paradigm of localized droplet transmission during non-aerosol-generating procedures.","Bischoff, Werner E; Swett, Katrina; Leng, Iris; Peters, Timothy R",The Journal of infectious diseases,86,16

With the increased use of bioprosthetic valves worldwide and strong patient desire for minimally invasive procedures, the safety and feasibility of robotic MVRs with bioprosthetic valves require investigation. METHODS Between January 2013 and May 2017, 52 consecutive patients underwent robotic MVRs using the da Vinci Si surgical system (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Their mean age was 55.1 ± 13.8 years, and mean EuroSCORE II was 2.25% ± 1.25%. Among the enrolled patients, 32 (61.5%) patients presented with preoperative atrial fibrillation, 6 (11.5%) patients had experienced embolic stroke and 5 (9.6%) patients had undergone previous cardiac surgery. The operations were performed using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) under an arrested heart status. RESULTS Five porcine valves and 47 bovine valves were implanted. A total of 38 (73.1%) patients received concomitant cardiac procedures, including 26 Cox-maze IV procedures, 12 tricuspid valve repairs and 5 atrial septal defect repairs. The mean aortic cross-clamp and CPB times were 141.3 ± 34.3 min and 217.1 ± 42.0 min, respectively. There was no operative mortality. During the mean follow-up of 29 ± 15 months, no prosthesis degeneration was noted. The average left atrial dimension exhibited a significant decrease from 51.4 ± 11.5 mm to 42.6 ± 10.1 mm. CONCLUSIONS Robotic MVR with bioprosthetic valves is safe, feasible and reproducible. Mid-term results are encouraging. Both aortic cross-clamp and CPB times can be improved with experience.","Kuo, Chia-Cheng; Chang, Hsiao-Huang; Hsing, Chung-Hsi; Hii, Hiong-Ping; Wu, Nan-Chun; Hsu, Chin-Ming; Chen, Chun-I; Cheng, Bor-Chih",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,86,24

DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES PubMed and Embase were searched using a string combination with keywords/Medical Subject Headings terms and free text in the search builder. Date of search was 13 April 2020. STUDY SELECTION Studies addressing PCSM following initial negative TRUS biopsies. Randomised controlled trials and population-based studies including men with initial negative TRUS biopsies reported in English from 1990 until present were included. DATA EXTRACTION Data extraction was done using a predefined form by two authors independently and compared with confirm data; risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies when applicable. RESULTS Four eligible studies were identified. Outcomes were reported differently in the studies as both cumulative incidence and Kaplan-Meier estimates have been used. Regardless of the study differences, all studies reported low estimated incidence of PCSM of 1.8%-5.2% in men with negative TRUS biopsies during the following 10-20 years. Main limitation in all studies was limited follow-up. CONCLUSION Only a few studies have investigated the risk of PCSM following initial negative biopsies and all studies included patients before the era of MRI of the prostate. However, the studies point to the fact that the risk of PCSM is low following initial negative TRUS biopsies, and that the level of prostate-specific antigen before biopsies holds prognostic information. This may be considered when advising patients about the need for further diagnostic evaluation.

Inhaled nitric oxide may facilitate transpulmonary blood flow during iCPR and may therefore improve organ perfusion and outcome. METHODS Ventricular fibrillation was electrically induced in 20 anesthetized male pigs. Animals were left untreated for 10 minutes before iCPR was attempted. Subjects received either 20 ppm of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO, n = 10) or 0 ppm iNO (Control, n = 10), simultaneously started with iCPR until 5 hours following ROSC. Animals were weaned from the respirator and followed up for five days using overall performance categories (OPC) and a spatial memory task. On day six, all animals were anesthetized again, and brains were harvested for neurohistopathologic evaluation. RESULTS All animals in both groups achieved ROSC. Administration of iNO markedly increased iCPR flow during CPR (iNO: 1.81 ± 0.30 vs CONTROL 1.64 ± 0.51 L/min, p < 0.001), leading to significantly higher coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) during the 6 minutes of CPR (25 ± 13 vs 16 ± 6 mmHg, p = 0.002). iNO-treated animals showed significantly lower S-100 serum levels thirty minutes post ROSC (0.26 ± 0.09 vs 0.38 ± 0.15 ng/mL, p = 0.048), as well as lower blood glucose levels 120-360 minutes following ROSC. Lower S-100 serum levels were reflected by superior clinical outcome of iNO-treated animals as estimated with OPC (3 ± 2 vs. 5 ± 1, p = 0.036 on days 3 to 5). Three out of ten iNO-treated, but none of the CONTROL animals were able to successfully participate in the spatial memory task. Neurohistopathological examination of vulnerable cerebral structures revealed a trend towards less cerebral lesions in neocortex, archicortex, and striatum in iNO-treated animals compared to CONTROLs. CONCLUSIONS In pigs resuscitated with mechanically-assisted CPR from prolonged cardiac arrest, the administration of 20 ppm iNO during and following iCPR improved transpulmonary blood flow, leading to improved clinical neurological outcomes.","Derwall, Matthias; Ebeling, Andreas; Nolte, Kay Wilhelm; Weis, Joachim; Rossaint, Rolf; Ichinose, Fumito; Nix, Christoph; Fries, Michael; Brücken, Anne",Critical care,86,1

RECENT FINDINGS Gastric SELs are a relatively frequent finding on routine endoscopy (incidence 0.2-3%). A systematic approach to diagnosis and management is key because many SELs are of little consequence, while others carry a high risk of malignant transformation. Because esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) cannot delineate depth of invasion or subepithelial appearance, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) should be considered a first-line modality. Recent data suggest EUS-guided fine needle biopsy (FNB) may be superior to traditional fine needle aspiration (FNA) for the diagnosis of gastric SELs due to its ability to obtain histologic specimens for immunohistochemical staining. Alternative techniques for tissue sampling (combined with simultaneous resection) include submucosal resection, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), submucosal tunnelling with endoscopic resection (STER) or endoscopic full-thickness resection (EFTR). SUMMARY This review details the endoscopic diagnosis and management of gastric SELs. Although EUS-guided sampling remains a first-line strategy (preferably with FNB), recent techniques including ESD, STER and EFTR have the potential to provide additional diagnostic and therapeutic options.","McCarty, Thomas R; Ryou, Marvin",Current opinion in gastroenterology,86,24

AICD is thought to progress through the activation of the extrinsic Fas/FasL pathway of cell death, leading to cytochrome-C release through caspase-8 and Bid activation. We recently described that, early upon AICD induction, mitochondria undergo structural alterations, which are required to promote cytochrome-C release and execute cell death. Here, we found that such alterations do not depend on the Fas/FasL pathway, which is instead only lately activated to amplify the cell death cascade. Instead, such alterations are primarily dependent on the MAPK proteins JNK1 and ERK1/2, which, in turn, regulate the activity of the pro-fission protein Drp1 and the pro-apoptotic factor Bim. The latter regulates cristae disassembly and cooperate with Drp1 to mediate the Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization (MOMP), leading to cytochrome-C release. Interestingly, we found that Bim is also downregulated in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) cells, this alteration favouring their escape from AICD-mediated control.","Simula, Luca; Corrado, Mauro; Accordi, Benedetta; Di Rita, Anthea; Nazio, Francesca; Antonucci, Ylenia; Di Daniele, Arianna; Caicci, Federico; Caruana, Ignazio; Soriano, Maria Eugenia; Pigazzi, Martina; Locatelli, Franco; Cecconi, Francesco; Campello, Silvia",Cell death and differentiation,86,1

The aim of this study was to describe an initial experience with the use of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy as a neoadjuvant agent for resectable or potentially resectable pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms. METHODS The postoperative outcomes of 23 patients with resectable or potentially resectable pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms at high risk of recurrence who underwent neoadjuvant peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (peptide receptor radionuclide therapy group) were compared with 23 patients who underwent upfront surgical operation (upfront surgery group). Patients were matched for tumor size, grade, and stage. Median follow-up was 61 months. RESULTS The size (median greatest width) of the primary pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms decreased after neoadjuvant peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (59 to 50 mm; P=.047). There were no differences in intraoperative and postoperative outcomes and there were no operative deaths, but the risk of developing a pancreatic fistula tended to be less in the peptide receptor radionuclide therapy group when compared to the upfront surgery group (0/23 vs 4/23; P < .02). The incidence of nodal metastases at the time of resection was also less in the peptide receptor radionuclide therapy group (n= 9/23 vs 17/23; P<.02). Neither median disease-specific survival (not reached in either group; P=.411) nor progression-free survival (52 vs 37 months; P>.2) differed between groups, but progression-free survival in the 31 patients who had an R0 resection seemed to be greater in the 15 patients in the peptide receptor radionuclide therapy group versus 16 patients the upfront group (median progression-free survival not reached vs 36 months; P<.05). CONCLUSION Neoadjuvant peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for resectable or potentially resectable pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms in patients with high-risk features of recurrence seems to be beneficial, but well-designed and much larger prospective trials are needed to confirm the safety and the oncologic value of this approach.","Partelli, Stefano; Bertani, Emilio; Bartolomei, Mirco; Perali, Carolina; Muffatti, Francesca; Grana, Chiara Maria; Schiavo Lena, Marco; Doglioni, Claudio; Crippa, Stefano; Fazio, Nicola; Zamboni, Giuseppe; Falconi, Massimo",Surgery,86,31

However, its N-terminal function remains elusive. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the N terminus (amino acids [aa] 11 to 125) of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 at a 1.25-Å resolution. Further functional assays showed that the N terminus of SARS-CoVs Nsp1 alone loses the ability to colocalize with ribosomes and inhibit protein translation. The C terminus of Nsp1 can colocalize with ribosomes, but its protein translation inhibition ability is significantly weakened. Interestingly, fusing the C terminus of Nsp1 with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or other proteins in place of its N terminus restored the protein translation inhibitory ability to a level equivalent to that of full-length Nsp1. Thus, our results suggest that the N terminus of Nsp1 is able to stabilize the binding of the Nsp1 C terminus to ribosomes and act as a nonspecific barrier to block the mRNA channel, thus abrogating host mRNA translation.","Zhao, Kaitao; Ke, Zunhui; Hu, Hongbing; Liu, Yahui; Li, Aixin; Hua, Rong; Guo, Fangteng; Xiao, Junfeng; Zhang, Yu; Duan, Ling; Yan, Xin-Fu; Gao, Yong-Gui; Liu, Bing; Xia, Yuchen; Li, Yan",Microbiology spectrum,86,33

However, the hemodynamic effect of recruitment maneuvers remain poorly documented in this setting. Material and Methods This was a prospective observational study performed in operating theatre including patients scheduled for major vascular surgery. Patients were monitored with invasive arterial pressure and esophageal doppler. After induction of general anesthesia, before surgery began, preload optimization based on stroke volume (SV) variation following fluid challenge was performed. Then, an alveolar recruitment maneuver (ARM) through stepwise increase in positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was performed. Hemodynamic data were noted before, during, and after the alveolar recruitment maneuver. Results ARM through stepwise increase in PEEP and CPAP were applied in 22 and 14 preload independent patients, respectively. Relative changes in SV during ARMs were significantly greater in the ARMCPAP group (-39 ± 20%) as compared to the ARMPEEP group (-15 ± 22%; P = 0.002). The difference (95% CI) in relative decrease in SV between ARMCPAP and ARMPEEP groups was -24% (-38 to -9; P = 0.001). Changes in arterial pressure, cardiac index, pulse pressure variation, peak velocity, and corrected flow time measures were not different between groups. Conclusion During anesthesia, in preload independent patients, ARMs through CPAP resulted in a significantly greater decrease in SV than stepwise increase in PEEP. During anesthesia, ARM should be used cautiously.","Hanouz, Jean Luc; Coquerel, Axel; Persyn, Christophe; Radenac, Dorothée; Gérard, Jean Louis; Fischer, Marc Olivier","Journal of anaesthesiology, clinical pharmacology",86,5

To date, there is only limited research examining whether skills are evaluated objectively and equally in simulation training, especially in microsurgery. The purpose of this study was to analyze the objectivity and equality of simulation evaluation results conducted in a contest format. A nationwide recruitment process was conducted to select study participants. Participants were recruited from a pool of qualified physicians with less than 10 years of experience. In this study, the simulation procedure consisted of incising a 1 mm thick blood vessel and suturing it with a 10-0 thread using a microscope. Initially, we planned to have the neurosurgical supervisors score the simulation procedure by direct observation. However, due to COVID-19, some study participants were unable to attend. Thus requiring some simulation procedures to be scored by video review. A total of 14 trainees participated in the study. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient among the scorers was 0.99, indicating a strong correlation. There was no statistically significant difference between the scores from the video review and direct observation judgments. There was a statistically significant difference (p <0.001) between the scores for some criteria. For the eight criteria, individual scorers assigned scores in a consistent pattern. However, this pattern differed between scorers indicating that some scorers were more lenient than others.

We hypothesised that a tech-supported model that aimed to promote timely inter-professional team coordination using video consultation with a remote physician while a nurse is in the patient's home would be non-inferior compared with a standard model that includes routine home visits by nurses and physicians. METHODS We conducted a pragmatic, cluster randomised non-inferiority trial across 14 sites (HomePal Study). Registered nurses (n=111) were randomised to the two models so that approximately half of the patients with any serious illness admitted to HBPC and their caregivers were enrolled in each study arm. Process measures (video and home visits and satisfaction) were tracked. The primary outcomes for patients and caregivers were symptom burden and caregiving preparedness at 1-2 months. RESULTS The study was stopped early after 12 months of enrolment (patients=3533; caregivers=463) due to a combination of low video visit uptake (31%), limited substitution of video for home visits, and the health system's decision to expand telehealth use in response to changes in telehealth payment policies, the latter of which was incompatible with the randomised design. Implementation barriers included persistent workforce shortages and inadequate systems that contributed to scheduling and coordination challenges and unreliable technology and connectivity. CONCLUSIONS We encountered multiple challenges to feasibility, relevance and value of conducting large, multiyear pragmatic randomised trials with seriously ill patients in the real-world settings where care delivery, regulatory and payment policies are constantly shifting.","Nguyen, Huong Q; McMullen, Carmit; Haupt, Eric C; Wang, Susan E; Werch, Henry; Edwards, Paula E; Andres, Gina M; Reinke, Lynn; Mittman, Brian S; Shen, Ernest; Mularski, Richard A",BMJ supportive & palliative care,86,28

Central venous spasm during pacemaker implantation is uncommon with only a few cases reported from time to time. Sometimes, the venous spasms may not respond to nitroglycerine injections which requires a change of access site and undue discomfort for the patient. CASE PRESENTATION A 72-year-old female patient with no prior comorbidities presented to us with recurrent dizziness on exertion and at rest. The electrocardiogram showed complete heart block, likely to be of sclerodegenerative etiology as the patient did not have any ischemic symptoms, also the electrocardiogram and echocardiogram did not show any evidence of ischemia. As part of the hospital protocol, a venogram was performed by giving intravenous diluted contrast (iohexol) through the left brachial vein, which showed good-sized axillary and subclavian veins. We attempted to cannulate the left axillary vein with a 16G needle using Seldinger technique, but the axillary vein could not be cannulated despite multiple attempts. We gave incremental boluses of intravenous nitroglycerine, despite that the left axillary vein could not be cannulated. Repeat intravenous contrast injection showed severe spasm of axillary and subclavian veins. Finally, the axillary vein was cannulated from the right side using anatomical landmarks and a pacemaker was implanted. CONCLUSIONS Venous spasm during device implantation although uncommon, it should be anticipated in patients with difficult cannulation to prevent inadvertent complications like pneumothorax and arterial injuries. Mild venous spasm may relieve with time but severe venous spasm may require a change of access site.","Vemuri, Krishna Santosh; Parashar, Nitin; Bootla, Dinakar; Revaiah, Pruthvi C; Kanabar, Kewal; Nevali, Krishna Prasad; Sharma, Yash Paul; Kasinadhuni, Ganesh; Panda, Prashant",The Egyptian heart journal : (EHJ) : official bulletin of the Egyptian Society of Cardiology,86,27

The aim of the present study is to analyse how this situation has affected the treatment of cholecystitis and cholelythiasis. Methods It is a descriptive national study after online voluntary distribution of a specific questionnaire with Google Drive™ to members of the Spanish Association of Surgeons (AEC). Results We received 153 answers (one per hospital). Elective cholecystectomies have been cancelled in 96.7% of centres. Conservative treatment for acute cholecystitis has been selected in 90% (previously 18%), and if operated, 95% have been performed laparoscopically. Globally, only 49% perform preoperative diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, and 58.5% recognize there have been cases confirmed postoperatively after other surgeries, with worse surgical outcomes in 54%. Conclusions This survey shows that most of the Spanish centers are following the surgical societies suggestions during the pandemic. However, some data requires to be taken into account for the next phase of the pandemic.","Ielpo, Benedetto; Prieto, Mikel; Ortega, Irene; Balibrea, José María; Rubio-Pérez, Inés; Juvany, Montse; Gómez-Bravo, Miguel Ángel; Ramia, José Manuel",Cirugia espanola,86,20

ACE2 is expressed in many human tissues, including the lungs. However, no research has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can infect human breast tissue. This study aimed to investigate ACE2 gene expression in human breast tissue using a public database. Materials and Methods A search of a public gene expression database was performed to investigate ACE2 gene expression in in human breast tissue. Results The gene expression profile demonstrated that ACE2 gene expression was higher in human breast tissue than human lung tissue. Conclusion Our knowledge about coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is expanding rapidly. Clinicians are eager for vetted information regarding all aspects of this new illness, and this study demonstrates that the level of ACE2 expression in human breast tissue is higher than that in the lung tissue, a major target tissue affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This finding strongly suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes breast pathology.","Al-Benna, Sammy",European journal of breast health,86,16

In this study, the marine sponge-derived natural compounds 4,6-dibromo-2-(2',4'-dibromophenoxy)phenol and 3,4,6-tribromo-2-(2',4'-dibromophenoxy)phenol were found to exhibit broad antibacterial activity against medically relevant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. The compounds were not only bactericidal against both replicating and stationary phase-persistent planktonic cells of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; they also killed biofilm-incorporated cells of both species while not affecting biofilm structural integrity. Moreover, these compounds were active against carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter sp. This simultaneous activity of compounds against different growth forms of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is rare. Genome sequencing of spontaneous resistant mutants and proteome analysis suggest that resistance is mediated by downregulation of the bacterial EIIBC phosphotransferase components scrA and mtlA in MRSA likely leading to a lower uptake of the molecules. Due to their only moderate cytotoxicity against human cell lines, phenoxyphenols provide an interesting new scaffold for development of antimicrobial agents with activity against planktonic cells, persisters and biofilm-incoporated cells of ESKAPE pathogens. KEY POINTS: • Brominated phenoxyphenols kill actively replicating and biofilm-incorporated bacteria. • Phosphotransferase systems mediate uptake of brominated phenoxyphenols. • Downregulation of phosphotransferase systems mediate resistance.","van Geelen, Lasse; Kaschani, Farnusch; Sazzadeh, Shabnam S; Adeniyi, Emmanuel T; Meier, Dieter; Proksch, Peter; Pfeffer, Klaus; Kaiser, Markus; Ioerger, Thomas R; Kalscheuer, Rainer",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,86,24

Although glial populations are tightly regulated, the mechanisms regulating the population size remain poorly understood. Since Drosophila glial cells are similar to the human counterparts in their functions and shapes, rendering them an excellent model system to understand the human glia biology. Lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPP) are important for regulating bioactive lipids. In Drosophila, there are three known LPP-encoding genes; wunen, wunen-2 and lazaro. The wunens are important for the germ cell migration and survival, and septate junction formation during tracheal development. Lazaro is involved in phototransduction. In the present study, we characterized a novel Drosophila LPP-encoding gene, CG11426. Suppression of CG11426 increased glial cell number in the eye imaginal disc during larval development, while ectopic CG11426 expression decreased it. Both types of mutation also caused defects in axon projection to the optic lobe in larval eye-brain complexes. Moreover, CG11426 promoted apoptosis via inhibiting ERK signaling in the eye imaginal disc. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that CG11426 gene product negatively regulates ERK signaling to promote apoptosis for proper maintenance of glial population in the developing eye disc.

Since 2006 numerous retrospective case reports and case series have reported a very strong association of this disease with exposure to gadolinium-based contrast agents (Gd-CA) for MR imaging in the setting of severe or end-stage renal disease. The purpose of this report is to summarize the medical literature reporting of biopsy-proven NSF cases in which the authors specifically investigated patient exposure to Gd-CA. A Pub Med MEDLINE search was performed using the key words--nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy. All case reports and case series of NSF were reviewed to determine if patients had a preceding exposure to Gd-CA and which specific Gd-CA was involved. If the original reports did not clarify the specific Gd-CA, I reviewed follow-up letters to the editors or contacted the authors to clarify which specific Gd-CA were linked to the NSF cases. If several reports originated from the same institution, clarification was also obtained to avoid redundant reporting. As of February 1, 2008 there have been 190 biopsy-proven cases of NSF published in the peer-reviewed literature with the following associations: 157 gadodiamide (Omniscan, GE Healthcare), 8 gadopentetate (Magnevist, Bayer Healthcare), 3 gadoversetamide (OptiMARK, Covidien), and 18 unspecified Gd-CA, and 4 confounded cases with more than one Gd-CA.

To our knowledge, however, intraluminal erosion of the band tubing into the duodenum has not been described. PATIENT AND METHODS We report a 46-year-old man in whom a laparoscopic adjustable gastric band tubing eroded into the duodenal lumen, causing recurrent port-site infections. This complication was diagnosed on upper endoscopy and also, in retrospect, on an upper gastrointestinal barium study and computed tomography. RESULTS The patient underwent surgical removal of the band and tubing, with a primary duodenal repair, and made a complete recovery without complications. CONCLUSION Erosion of laparoscopic band tubing into the duodenum should be included in the differential diagnosis for recurrent port-site infections after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Radiographic or endoscopic visualization of the intraluminal portion of the tubing may be required for confirmation. Definitive treatment of this complication entails surgical removal of the tubing from the duodenum.","Cintolo, Jessica A; Levine, Marc S; Huang, Stephanie; Dumon, Kristoffel",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

To minimize data misinterpretation, robustness reference values for biomarkers were important in biomonitoring programs. Specific three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, immune reference ranges for field studies had been determined based on laboratory data and one reference station (Contentieuse river at Houdancourt). In this study, data obtained in one uncontaminated and three contaminated sites were compared to these reference ranges as a validation step before considering them for larger scale biomonitoring programs. When the field reference range were compared to data from the uncontaminated station (Béronelle), only few deviations were shown. In this way, data coming from uncontaminated station (Béronelle) was integrated in the field reference ranges to improve the evaluation of site variability. The new field reference ranges provided better discrimination of sites and spanned a larger range of fish lengths than the initial reference ranges. Furthermore, the results suggest lysosomal presence during several months and phagocytosis capacity in autumn may be the most relevant immunomarkers towards identifying contaminated sites. In the future, combining this reference value approach with active biomonitoring could facilitate the obtention of data in multiple stream conditions.","Marchand, Adrien; Tebby, Cleo; Catteau, Audrey; Turiès, Cyril; Porcher, Jean-Marc; Bado-Nilles, Anne",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,86,29

In order to improve such patients' outcome, we conducted a phase 2, prospective, multicenter trial to test the feasibility of a new sequential regimen, combining a short course of intensive chemotherapy and a reduced intensity-conditioning regimen, before allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Twenty-four patients (median age, 47 years) with acute myeloid leukemia in primary treatment failure were included. Cytogenetic risk was poor in 15 patients (62%) and intermediate in nine (38%). The sequential regimen consisted of clofarabine (30 mg/m2/day) and cytosine arabinoside (1 g/m2/day) for 5 days, followed, after a 3-day rest, by reduced-intensity conditioning and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation combining cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg), intravenous busulfan (3.2 mg/kg/day) for 2 days and anti-thymocyte globulin (2.5 mg/kg/day) for 2 days. Patients in complete remission at day +120 received prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion. Eighteen patients (75%) achieved complete remission.

It provides a stable platform with high definition three-dimensional views and improved access, which enhances the capabilities for precise dissection in a narrow surgical field. These distinctive features have made it an attractive option for colorectal surgeons. AIM The aim of this study was to present a standardised technique for single-docking robotic rectal resection and to analyse clinical outcomes of the first 100 robotic rectal procedures performed in a single centre between May 2013 and April 2015. METHOD Prospectively collected data related to 100 consecutive patients who underwent single-docking robotic rectal surgery was analysed for surgical and oncological outcomes. RESULTS Sixty-six patients were male, the median age was 67 years (range-24-92). Eighteen patients had neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy whilst 23 patients had BMI >30. Procedures performed included anterior resection (n = 74), abdominoperineal resection (n = 10), completion proctectomy (n = 9), restorative proctectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) (n = 5) and Hartmann's procedure (n = 2). The median operating time was 240 min (range-135-456), and median blood loss was 10 ml (range 0-200). There was no conversion or intra-operative complication. Median length of stay was 7 days (range, 3-48) and readmission rate was 12 %. Thirty-day mortality was zero. Postoperatively, two patients had an anastomotic leak whilst two had small bowel obstruction. The median lymph node harvest was 18 (range, 6-43). CONCLUSION The single-docking robotic technique should be considered as an alternative option for rectal surgery.

The scientific goal was to characterize the residual concentrations in eggs from treated hens and suggest the withdrawal periods that should be respected to avoid risk for consumers. Thirty-four laying hens were allocated into two groups: Group A was treated with fipronil in feed, two single doses of 1 mg kg-1 day-1 ; Group B was administered a single dose of 1 mg kg-1 by the topical route. Fipronil egg residues were quantified by HPLC-MS/MS. Fipronil and its sulphone metabolite (fipronil-SO2 ) were measured in egg after both treatments. The highest egg residual profile was always for fipronil-SO2 . Mean maximum egg concentrations (Cmax ) of 228.5 ± 79.8 ng/g (fipronil) and 1,849 ± 867 ng/g (fipronil-SO2 ) were found after fipronil administration in feed. The lowest residual levels were quantified after the topical treatment with Cmax of 27.1 ± 4.9 and 163 ± 26 ng/g for fipronil and fipronil-SO2 . Mean fipronil marker residues and established MRLs allowed calculating the withdrawal periods, the shortest being 74 days after topical administration. Such a long withdrawal period is difficult to meet in egg production systems. Thus, the extra-label use of fipronil in laying hens should not be recommended under any circumstances.","Canton, Lucila; Canton, Candela; Ceballos, Laura; Domínguez, Paula; Rodríguez, José; Lanusse, Carlos; Alvarez, Luis; Moreno, Laura",Journal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics,86,22

METHODS This study is a cross-sectional survey in which 630 Japanese male employees aged 30 years and older participated. Five hundred and eighty-six subjects participated in the measurement of grip strength, and 355 subjects participated in the measurement of leg extension power. Blood samples were obtained for serum UA analysis. RESULTS After adjustment for potential confounders, grip strength differed significantly between participants with and those without hyperuricemia (geometric mean and 95% confidence interval [CI]: 40.3 [39.2-41.3] kg vs. 41.9 [41.3-42.5] kg; P = 0.01). In addition, serum UA levels (quartiles) showed an inverted J-shaped curve with grip strength (mean and 95% CI: Q1, 41.6 [40.6-42.6] kg; Q2, 42.2 [41.2-43.2] kg; Q3, 41.8 [40.8-42.8] kg; Q4, 40.4 [39.3-41.4] kg; P for quadratic trend = 0.05). The results in the leg extension power group were similar to those observed in the grip strength group. CONCLUSION This population-based cross-sectional study shows for the first time that hyperuricemia is associated with poor muscle strength. Moreover, the results indicate an inverted J-shaped association between serum UA quartiles and muscle strength.","Huang, Cong; Niu, Kaijun; Kobayashi, Yoritoshi; Guan, Lei; Momma, Haruki; Cui, Yufei; Chujo, Masahiro; Otomo, Atsushi; Guo, Hui; Tadaura, Hiroko; Nagatomi, Ryoichi",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,86,17

It is essential for OABD to adhere to the COVID-19 measures, with potential consequences for the psychiatric symptoms. This situation offers the unique opportunity to investigate factors of vulnerability and resilience that are associated with psychiatric symptoms in OABD. METHODS This study included 81 OABD patients aged over 50 years. Factors measured at baseline in patients that participated in 2017/18 were compared with factors measured during the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS Participants experienced less psychiatric symptoms during COVID-19 than (67.9% euthymic) than at baseline (40.7% euthymic). There was no difference in loneliness between COVID-19 and baseline. Not having children, more feelings of loneliness, lower mastery, passive coping style and neuroticism were associated with more psychiatric symptoms during COVID-19 measures. CONCLUSIONS Participants experienced less psychiatric symptoms during COVID-19 measures when compared to baseline. Our results indicate promising targets for psychological interventions aimed at curing and preventing recurrence in OABD and improving quality of life in this growing vulnerable group.

A central mechanism for COVID-19 pathophysiology has been proposed: imbalance of angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE)1 and ACE2 (ACE2 being the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] virus ""receptor"") that results in tissue injury from angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated signaling. This mechanism provides a rationale for multiple therapeutic approaches. In parallel, clinical data from retrospective analysis of COVID-19 cohorts has revealed that ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may be beneficial in COVID-19. These findings have led to the initiation of clinical trials using approved drugs that target the generation (ACEIs) and actions (ARBs) of Ang II. However, treatment of COVID-19 with ACEIs/ARBs poses several challenges. These include choosing appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria, dose optimization, risk of adverse effects and drug interactions, and verification of target engagement. Other approaches related to the RAS pathway might be considered, for example, inhalational administration of ACEIs/ARBs (to deliver drugs directly to the lungs) and use of compounds with other actions (e.g., activation of ACE2, agonism of MAS1 receptors, β-arrestin-based Angiotensin receptor agonists, and administration of soluble ACE2 or ACE2 peptides). Studies with animal models could test such approaches and assess therapeutic benefit. This Perspective highlights questions whose answers could advance RAS-targeting agents as mechanism-driven ways to blunt tissue injury, morbidity, and mortality of COVID-19.","Sriram, Krishna; Loomba, Rohit; Insel, Paul A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,86,1

Although this is a developmental task for all adolescents, it is especially salient for sexual and gender minority youth. Owing to oppressive social structures and stigmatized identities, adolescents who identify as nonheterosexual or noncisgender are vulnerable to experiencing disproportionate adverse health outcomes. METHODS To further the literature on adolescent mental health among sexual and gender minority youth, this study analyzed a representative statewide sample of high school students (ages 14-18) to analyze how sexual orientation and gender identity are associated with depression and suicidality. RESULTS Results aligned with previous research demonstrating that sexual and gender minority youth were all at a heightened risk for depression. However, transgender youth and youth questioning their sexuality or gender were at especially heightened risk for experiencing depression and suicidality. CONCLUSION The findings of this study indicate a need to target or adapt direct services and programming for sexual and gender minority adolescents.","Guz, Samantha; Kattari, Shanna K; Atteberry-Ash, Brittanie; Klemmer, Cary L; Call, Jarrod; Kattari, Leonardo",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,86,12

The fusogenicity of MuV differs depending on the strains and might correlate with the virulence; however, it is unclear which mechanisms contribute to the differentiated fusogenicity. The cleavage motif of MuV F is highly conserved among all strains except the amino acid residue at position 8 (P8) that shows a certain variability with a total of four amino acid variants (leucine (L), proline (P), serine (S), threonine (T)). We demonstrate that P8 affects the proteolytic processing and the fusogenicity of MuV F. The presence of L or S at P8 position resulted in a slower proteolysis of MuV F by furin and a reduced ability to mediate cell-cell fusion. However, virus-cell fusion was more efficient for F proteins harboring L or S at P8, suggesting that P8 contributes to the mechanism of viral spread: P and T enable a rapid spread of infection by cell-to-cell fusion, whereas viruses harboring L or S at P8 spread preferentially by the release of infectious viral particles. Our study provides novel insights into the fusogenicity of MuV and its influence on the mechanisms of virus spread within infected tissues. Assuming a correlation between MuV fusogenicity and virulence, sequence information on the amino acid residue at P8 might be helpful to estimate the virulence of circulating and emerging strains.IMPORTANCE Mumps virus (MuV) is the causative agent of the highly infectious disease mumps. Mumps is mainly associated with mild symptoms, but severe complications such as encephalitis, meningitis or orchitis can also occur. There is evidence that the virulence of different MuV strains and variants might correlate with the ability of the fusion protein (F) to mediate cell-to-cell fusion. However, the relation between virulence and fusogenicity or the mechanisms responsible for the varying fusogenicity of different MuV strains are incompletely understood. Here we focused on the amino acid residue 8 (P8) of the proteolytic cleavage site of MuV F, because this amino acid residue shows a striking variability depending on the genotypes of MuV. The P8 residue has a significant effect on the proteolytic processing and fusogenicity of MuV F and might thereby determine the route of viral spread within infected tissues.","Hüttl, Sarah; Hoffmann, Markus; Steinmetzer, Torsten; Sauder, Christian; Krüger, Nadine",Journal of virology,86,1

Initial outbreaks in China involved 13.8% cases with severe, and 6.1% with critical courses3. This severe presentation corresponds to the usage of a virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung2,4. By causing an early onset of severe symptoms, this same receptor tropism is thought to have determined pathogenicity, but also aided the control, of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 20035. However, there are reports of COVID-19 cases with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, suggesting the potential for pre- or oligosymptomatic transmission6-8. There is an urgent need for information on body site-specific virus replication, immunity, and infectivity. Here we provide a detailed virological analysis of nine cases, providing proof of active virus replication in upper respiratory tract tissues. Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms (peak at 7.11 × 108 RNA copies per throat swab, day 4). Infectious virus was readily isolated from throat- and lung-derived samples, but not from stool samples, in spite of high virus RNA concentration. Blood and urine never yielded virus. Active replication in the throat was confirmed by viral replicative RNA intermediates in throat samples. Sequence-distinct virus populations were consistently detected in throat and lung samples from the same patient, proving independent replication. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after 7 days in 50% of patients (14 days in all), but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load. COVID-19 can present as a mild upper respiratory tract illness. Active virus replication in the upper respiratory tract puts the prospects of COVID-19 containment in perspective.","Wölfel, Roman; Corman, Victor M; Guggemos, Wolfgang; Seilmaier, Michael; Zange, Sabine; Müller, Marcel A; Niemeyer, Daniela; Jones, Terry C; Vollmar, Patrick; Rothe, Camilla; Hoelscher, Michael; Bleicker, Tobias; Brünink, Sebastian; Schneider, Julia; Ehmann, Rosina; Zwirglmaier, Katrin; Drosten, Christian; Wendtner, Clemens",Nature,86,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective institutional review board-approved study included 65 patients (mean [SD] age, 71.3 ± 9 years; mean [SD] body mass index, 24.4 [4.8] kg) who underwent routine CT examinations of the abdomen/pelvis followed immediately by 2 low-dose scans. Raw data sets were reconstructed by using filtered back projection (FBP), adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR), and a model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR). Measurements of objective noise and CT numbers were compared using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Six subjective image quality parameters were scored. Diagnostic confidence and accuracy in detection of various elementary lesions were performed. RESULTS Objectively, mean image noise for MBIR was significantly superior at all dose levels (P < 0.001). Subjectively, standard-dose ASIR and low-dose MBIR scans were better than standard-dose FBP scan in all parameters assessed (P < 0.05). Low-dose MBIR scans were comparable with standard-dose ASIR scans in all parameters except at noise index of 70 (approximately 85% dose reduction), where, in this case, the detection of liver lesions less than 5 mm were rated inferior (P < 0.05) with diagnostic accuracy reducing to 77.4%. CONCLUSIONS Low-dose MBIR scan shows superior objective noise reduction compared with standard-dose FBP and ASIR. Subjectively, low-dose MBIR scans at 76% dose reduction were also superior compared with standard-dose FBP and ASIR. However, at dose reductions of 85%, small liver lesions may be missed.","Vardhanabhuti, Varut; Riordan, Richard D; Mitchell, Grant R; Hyde, Christopher; Roobottom, Carl A",Investigative radiology,86,1

There is a need to identify better biomarkers to detect NSCLC at an early stage as this will improve therapeutic effect and patient survival rates. METHODS Two lectins (AAL/AAGL and AAL2/AANL), which specifically bind to tumour-related glycan antigens, were first used to enrich serum glycoproteins from the serum of early NSCLC patients, benign lung diseases subjects and healthy individuals. The samples were investigated by using iTRAQ labelling and LC-MS/MS. RESULTS A total of 53 differentially expressed proteins were identified by quantitative proteomics and four glycoproteins (AACT, AGP1, CFB and HPX) were selected for further verification by western blotting. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed AACT was the best candidate for early NSCLC diagnosis of the four proteins, with 94.1% sensitivity in distinguishing early tumour Stage (IA+IB) from tumour-free samples (healthy and benign samples, HB). The GlcNAcylated AACT was further detected by lectin-based ELISA and has better advantage in clinical application than total AACT. The GlcNAcylated AACT can effectively differentiate Stage I from HB samples with an AUC of 0.908 and 90.9% sensitivity at a specificity of 86.2%. A combination of GlcNAcylated AACT and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was able to effectively differing Stage I from HB samples (AUC=0.914), which significantly improve the specificity of CEA. The combination application also has the better clinical diagnostic efficacy in distinguishing cancer (NSCLC) from HB samples than CEA or GlcNAcylated AACT used alone, and yielded an AUC of 0.817 with 93.1% specificity. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that the GlcNAcylated AACT will be a promising clinical biomarker in diagnosis of early NSCLC.","Jin, Yanxia; Wang, Jie; Ye, Xiangdong; Su, Yanting; Yu, Guojun; Yang, Qing; Liu, Wei; Yu, Wenhui; Cai, Jie; Chen, Xi; Liang, Yi; Chen, Yijie; Wong, Barry Hon Cheung; Fu, Xiangning; Sun, Hui",British journal of cancer,86,28

Here we report for the first time that NC is a potential therapeutic agent for mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) occurring in the head and neck because it suppresses X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) in human MEC in vitro and in vivo. The antitumor effects of NC were evaluated by trypan blue exclusion assay, western blotting, live/dead assay, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, human apoptosis antibody array, immunofluorescence staining, immunohistochemistry, small interfering RNA assay, transient transfection of XIAP overexpression vector, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and histopathological examination of organs. NC inhibited cell viability and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in vitro. A human apoptosis antibody array assay showed that XIAP is suppressed by NC treatment. XIAP was overexpressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tissues that arose from the head and neck, and high XIAP expression was correlated with poor prognosis in OSCC patients. XIAP depletion significantly increased apoptosis, and ectopic XIAP overexpression attenuated the apoptosis induced by NC treatment. NC suppressed tumor growth in vivo at a dosage of 5 mg/kg/day. The number of TUNEL-positive cells increased and the protein expression of XIAP was consistently downregulated in NC-treated tumor tissues. In addition, NC caused no histopathological changes in the liver or kidney. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of action underlying the anticancer effects of NC and demonstrate that NC is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of human MEC of the head and neck. KEY MESSAGES: • Nitidine chloride induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in MEC of the head and neck. • High XIAP expression correlates with poor prognosis of OSCC patients. • Nitidine chloride suppresses tumor growth in vivo without any systemic toxicities. • Targeting XIAP is a novel chemotherapeutic strategy for MEC of the head and neck.","Kwon, Hye-Jeong; Yoon, Kyungsil; Jung, Ji-Youn; Ryu, Mi Heon; Kim, Sung-Hyun; Yoo, Eun-Seon; Choi, So-Young; Yang, In-Hyoung; Hong, Seong Doo; Shin, Ji-Ae; Cho, Sung-Dae",Journal of molecular medicine,86,6

Previous diploid-based genome assemblies for the domestic cat have served as the primary reference for genomic studies within the cat family. However, these versions suffered from poor resolution of complex and highly repetitive regions, with substantial amounts of unplaced sequence that is polymorphic or copy number variable. We sequenced the genome of a female F1 Bengal hybrid cat, the offspring of a domestic cat (Felis catus) x Asian leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) cross, with PacBio long sequence reads and used Illumina sequence reads from the parents to phase >99.9% of the reads into the two species' haplotypes. De novo assembly of the phased reads produced highly continuous haploid genome assemblies for the domestic cat and Asian leopard cat, with contig N50 statistics exceeding 83 Mb for both genomes. Whole genome alignments reveal the Felis and Prionailurus genomes are colinear, and the cytogenetic differences between the homologous F1 and E4 chromosomes represent a case of centromere repositioning in the absence of a chromosomal inversion. Both assemblies offer significant improvements over the previous domestic cat reference genome, with a 100% increase in contiguity and the capture of the vast majority of chromosome arms in one or two large contigs. We further demonstrated that comparably accurate F1 haplotype phasing can be achieved with members of the same species when one or both parents of the trio are not available. These novel genome resources will empower studies of feline precision medicine, adaptation and speciation.","Bredemeyer, Kevin R; Harris, Andrew J; Li, Gang; Zhao, Le; Foley, Nicole M; Roelke-Parker, Melody; O'Brien, Stephen J; Lyons, Leslie A; Warren, Wesley C; Murphy, William J",The Journal of heredity,86,1

In this work, a thorough investigation is performed to quantify how an outer inert shell maintains the PLQY of Nd3+-doped LnNPs suspended in an aqueous environment. Three relevant quantitative findings affecting the PLQY of Nd3+-doped LnNPs are identified: i) PLQY of core LnNPs is improved 3-fold upon inert shell coating, ii) PLQY decreases with increasing Nd3+ doping despite the inert shell, iii) solvent quenching has a major influence over the PLQY of the LnNPs, though it is relatively lessened for high Nd3+ doping. Overall, we shed new light on the impact of the LnNP architecture on the NIR emission as well as on the quenching effects caused by doping concentration and solvent molecules.","Skripka, Artiom; Benayas, Antonio; Brites, Carlos D S; Martin, Inocencio R; Carlos, Luís D; Vetrone, Fiorenzo",Nano letters,86,31

OBJECTIVES To assess the frequency and risk factors for CDI in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective, single-center assessment of the frequency and risk factors for CDI in patients with COVID-19 and in the pre-pandemic era. The analysis included 441 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and 2,961 patients hospitalized before the pandemic. RESULTS There was a significant increase in the incidence of CDI during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period: 10.9% vs 2.6%, p <0.0001. Risk factors for CDI in COVID-19 patients included: age, length of hospital stay, occurrence of diarrhea during hospitalization, antibiotics other than azithromycin, coexistence of nervous system disease, and chronic kidney disease - all had weak association with CDI development. Multivariable logistic regression model indicated the presence of other unmeasured variables which had an impact on CDI incidence rate. CONCLUSIONS We have observed a significantly higher incidence of CDI in patients with COVID-19. Antibiotic treatment was an important risk factor, although the effect was weak. Other drugs used during the pandemic did not have an impact. Possible causes may include fecal microbiota disruption by SARS-CoV-2 infection, but more studies are needed to prove this hypothesis.","Lewandowski, Konrad; Rosołowski, Mariusz; Kaniewska, Magdalena; Kucha, Piotr; Meler, Anna; Wierzba, Waldemar; Rydzewska, Grażyna",Polish archives of internal medicine,86,20

We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to determine whether montelukast maintains symptomatic remission induced by topical steroid therapy in patients with EoE. METHODS We performed a prospective study of adult patients with EoE (solid-food dysphagia and a peak esophageal eosinophil count of >20 cells/high-powered field) enrolled at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, from April 2008 through February 2015. All patients had been treated previously for at least 6 weeks with a topical steroid until their symptoms were in remission. Steroids were discontinued and patients then were assigned randomly to groups given montelukast (20 mg/day, n = 20) or placebo (n = 21) for 26 weeks (groups were matched for age, sex, history of allergic disease, reflux symptoms, and endoscopic findings of EoE). Study participants were assessed via a structured telephone interview at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. Remission was defined as the absence of solid-food dysphagia. RESULTS Based on an intention-to-treat analysis, after 26 weeks, 40.0% of subjects in the montelukast group and 23.8% in the placebo group were in remission. The odds ratio for remission in the montelukast group was 0.48 (95% confidence interval, 0.10-2.16) (P = .33). No side effects were reported from either group. CONCLUSIONS In a randomized controlled trial of the ability of montelukast to maintain remission in patients in remission from EoE after steroid therapy, we found montelukast to be well tolerated; 40% of patients remained in remission, but this proportion did not differ significantly from that of the placebo group.

Most patients with BHD have multiple pulmonary cysts, and are at high risk of repeated pneumothorax. Although an increasing number of patients are diagnosed with BHD by genetic testing, therapeutic approaches for intractable pneumothorax have not yet been described. METHODS We treated three patients who had repeated episodes of pneumothorax. All had multiple pulmonary cysts in the lower lobes, and two had a family history of pneumothorax. Video-assisted thoracic surgery was used to perform wedge resections and partial pleural covering of the cystic lesions. The partial pleural covering technique used sheets of polyglycolic acid felt or regenerative oxidized cellulose mesh. The resected tissues underwent histopathological evaluation, and peripheral blood leukocytes were tested for FLCN mutations. RESULTS The operative times were less than 2 h, and there were no complications. The resected cysts had histopathological features characteristic of BHD lung. All patients were found to have FLCN germline mutations; thus their repeated pneumothoraces were a manifestation of BHD. None of the patients developed respiratory problems after undergoing the partial pleural covering procedure, and they have all been well without pneumothorax for 30 months or more. CONCLUSIONS Partial pleural covering combined with resection of protruding cysts should be a safe and effective therapeutic approach for BHD patients with intractable pneumothorax. Further investigation is needed to establish a detailed protocol for treatment of pneumothorax that results in minimal functional impairment.","Okada, Akira; Hirono, Tatsuhiko; Watanabe, Takehiro; Hasegawa, Go; Tanaka, Reiko; Furuya, Mitsuko",The clinical respiratory journal,86,27

During the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the epidemiology of these viruses seems to have changed dramatically. In Australia and New Zealand, a significant decrease in both influenza and bronchiolitis have been noticed during usual peak seasons. Data from early months of winter seasons in Europe are showing similar trends. This current scenario imposes a reconsideration of the paradigm that toddlers and young schoolchildren are the main drivers of seasonal RSV outbreaks and respiratory epidemics in general. In this article, we summarize current literature, address current knowledge or role of adults in the RSV epidemiology, describe the lessons learned from pertussis epidemics and call the international community to better understand the community transmission dynamics of respiratory infections in all age groups. This can allow the establishment of better and more affordable preventive measures in the whole population level, which can ultimately save millions of child lives.","Binns, Emma; Koenraads, Marianne; Hristeva, Lidia; Flamant, Alix; Baier-Grabner, Sebastian; Loi, Mervin; Lempainen, Johanna; Osterheld, Elise; Ramly, Bazlin; Chakakala-Chaziya, Jessica; Enaganthi, Niveditha; Simó Nebot, Silvia; Buonsenso, Danilo",Pediatric pulmonology,86,15

We describe our experience using a new detachable tip microcatheter in the embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations, pial arteriovenous fistulas, and vein of Galen malformations. We describe the safety and efficacy using a new detachable tip microcatheter in the treatment of pediatric deep brain arteriovenous malformations, pial malformations, and vein of Galen malformations. METHODS During a period of 9 months from March 2013 through January 2014, 11 pediatric patients in 14 procedures with 27 total injections were selected for treatment with a detachable tip under Food and Drug Administration (FDA) compassionate use exemption and were admitted to our department for treatment of their brain AVM using a liquid embolic agent and a detachable tip microcatheter. The ages of the patients ranged from 3 months to 18 years old. RESULTS Of the 27 total injections done, the tip detached in seven cases. For the 16 n-BCA injections, the tip detached six times (37.5 %), and for the 11 Onyx injections, the tip detached one time (9 %). There were no cases of premature microcatheter detachment during normal vessel navigation. CONCLUSIONS The introduction of these detachable tip microcatheters allows for a safe and relaxed injection that permits a true circumferential occlusion, and may further permit filling a larger amount of angioarchitecture without the risk of distal migration, or vessel damage during the usual rapid removal of non detachable micocatheters.","Altschul, David; Paramasivam, Srinivasan; Ortega-Gutierrez, Santiago; Fifi, Johanna T; Berenstein, Alejandro",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,86,1

Obesity is among the newest health matters that human beings are struggling with. Length of bypassed intestine is important in achievement of most weight loss and least nutritional and absorptive disorders. This study has aimed to assess short-term metabolic and nutritional effects of laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass/one anastomosis gastric bypass (MGB/OAGB) with a loop bypass length of 180 centimeters (cm) and compare these factors among patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 40-45 and 45-50 kilograms per square meter (kg/m2). Methods 25 patients were put in group 1 (BMI = 40-45 kg/m2) and 25 patients in group 2 (BMI = 45-50 kg/m2). Patients' BMI, postoperative weight, excess weight loss, and laboratory tests including fasting blood sugar (FBS), lipid profile, serum iron (Fe), ferritin, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), 25-OH vitamin D, vitamin B12, liver function tests, and albumin were recorded preoperatively and within 3- and 6-month follow-up. Results Weight loss and BMI reduction was significantly more in patients with higher BMI level (P=0.007), and excess weight loss was higher in patients with lower preoperative BMI level (P=0.007), and excess weight loss was higher in patients with lower preoperative BMI level (P=0.007), and excess weight loss was higher in patients with lower preoperative BMI level (. Conclusion Based on this study, 180-cm intestinal bypassed length works for patients with a BMI level of 40-45 and 45-50 kg/m2, according to their significant decrease in weight, BMI, and improving glycolipid profile.","Mahmoudieh, Mohsen; Keleidari, Behrouz; Afshin, Naser; Sayadi Shahraki, Masoud; Shahabi Shahmiri, Shahab; Sheikhbahaei, Erfan; Melali, Hamid",Journal of obesity,86,22

It is an important determinant of viral host range and cross-species infection and a primary target for antiviral intervention. Coronaviruses recognize a variety of host receptors, infect many hosts, and are health threats to humans and animals. The receptor-binding S1 subunit of coronavirus spike proteins contains two distinctive domains, the N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and the C-terminal domain (S1-CTD), both of which can function as receptor-binding domains (RBDs). S1-NTDs and S1-CTDs from three major coronavirus genera recognize at least four protein receptors and three sugar receptors and demonstrate a complex receptor recognition pattern. For example, highly similar coronavirus S1-CTDs within the same genus can recognize different receptors, whereas very different coronavirus S1-CTDs from different genera can recognize the same receptor. Moreover, coronavirus S1-NTDs can recognize either protein or sugar receptors. Structural studies in the past decade have elucidated many of the puzzles associated with coronavirus-receptor interactions. This article reviews the latest knowledge on the receptor recognition mechanisms of coronaviruses and discusses how coronaviruses have evolved their complex receptor recognition pattern. It also summarizes important principles that govern receptor recognition by viruses in general.","Li, Fang",Journal of virology,86,1

Moreover, injury of the adjacent structures has been reported when using a blind access. The aim of the current study was to assess the utility of a CT-based (CT: computed tomography) image registered navigation system in identifying safe gastrointestinal access sites for NOTES and identifying intraperitoneal structures. METHODS A total of 30 access procedures were performed in 30 pigs: anterior gastric wall (n = 10), posterior gastric wall (n = 10), and anterior rectal wall (n = 10). Of these, 15 procedures used image registered guidance (IR-NOTES) and 15 procedures used a blind access (NOTES only). Timed abdominal exploration was performed with identification of 11 organs. The location of the endoscopic tip was tracked using an electromagnetic tracking system and was recorded for each case. Necropsy was performed immediately after the procedure. The primary outcome was the rate of complications; secondary outcome variables were number of organs identified and kinematic measurements. RESULTS A total of 30 animals weighting a mean (± SD) of 30.2 ± 6.8 kg were included in the study. The incision point was correctly placed in 11 out of 15 animals in each group (73.3 %). The mean peritoneoscopy time and the number of properly identified organs were equivalent in the two groups. There were eight minor complications (26.7 %), two (13.3 %) in the IR-NOTES group and six (40.0 %) in the NOTES only group ( P = n. s.). Characteristics of the endoscope tip path showed a statistically significant improvement in trajectory smoothness of motion for all organs in the IR-NOTES group. CONCLUSION The image registered system appears to be feasible in NOTES procedures and results from this study suggest that image registered guidance might be useful for supporting navigation with an increased smoothness of motion.","Fernández-Esparrach, G; San José Estépar, R; Guarner-Argente, C; Martínez-Pallí, G; Navarro, R; Rodríguez de Miguel, C; Córdova, H; Thompson, C C; Lacy, A M; Donoso, L; Ayuso-Colella, J R; Ginès, A; Pellisé, M; Llach, J; Vosburgh, K G",Endoscopy,86,8

World scientists are providing joint efforts for better understanding of the virus and the pharmaceutical companies are racing to produce the COVID-19 vaccine which would relieve the stress posed on the world. Social implications of COVID-19 are immense and comparable to health implications. Given the divided public opinion on vaccination for other infectious diseases in general it is interesting to investigate what do people think about COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: Data was acquired in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the period from June to July of 2020 by means of a public questionnaire which consisted of 13 questions. A total of 1237 was provided by 420 male and 817 female participants in the age range of 16–79. Result: Out of all respondents 679 would approve administration of the vaccine, while 558 would not. The results presented in this paper show that most of the respondents who are against vaccination belong to less educated part of the community, while higher educated respondents are more optimistic regarding the vaccine effects. Conclusion: Most vaccination opponents have little to no connection with medical sciences indicating that their attitude towards vaccination is based upon news repositories and social network campaigns which are often filled with false information. As the questionnaire was presented to the public in the period when the effects of COVID-19 were less pronounced than today, it is possible that the public opinion in the future will be shifted to vaccination approval by the general public. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Hrvat, F.; Aleta, A.; Džuho, A.; Hasanić, O.; Bećirović, L.

In particular, quarantine measures have been related to negative psychological effects, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, stress, anxiety, and depression (1). This rise in mental health disorders might be even worse among people more vulnerable to psychological stress such as patients suffering from chronic rheumatic diseases (RDs). Objectives: The present Italian nationwide survey engages patients with rheumatic conditions through eleven associations of RD patients. It is conducted to establish the COVID-19 related self-reported poor mental health symptoms and to identify potential factors associated with these concerns among RDs who experienced the COVID-19 quarantine in Italy. Methods: We collected data from May to September 2020 from RD patients living in Italy during the COVID-19 quarantine by an ad-hoc online survey. By using their mailing list and the related webpage and social network, eleven patients' associations sent a call to RD patients asking them to complete an anonymous online survey which included the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Impact Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). χ2 tests were performed to detect statistically significant differences in both rating scale scores between groups defined by qualitative variables. Correlation analyses were realized with quantitative variables and rating scale scores. Variables significant in univariate analyses were then inserted in multivariate regression models. Results: In total, 507 RD patients completed to the survey. 375 (73.9%) patients had inflammatory arthritis (243 rheumatoid arthritis, 76 psoriatic arthritis, 49 ankylosing spondylitis, and 7 Still's disease), and 96 (18.9%) with connective tissue diseases or systemic vasculitis. 31 (6.1%) patients had primary fibromyalgia and 5 osteoarthritis or crystal arthropathies. Self-reported major sources of anxiety are reported in the Figure 1 below. The mean (SD) scores of the PSS-10 and the IES-R were 18.1 ± 8.1 and 29.7 ± 17.5, respectively. With regard to the IES-R subscale scores, the total sample did not show a prominence of one of the three main domains (intrusion, avoidance and hyperarousal). Higher PSS scores were significantly associated with younger age (p<0.01), female gender (p<0.01), living outside Lombardy (p=0.03), presence of overweight/obesity (p=0.01), ongoing psychopharmacotherapy (p<0.01), and anxiety for loss of incomes (p<0.01). Female gender (p<0.01) and living outside Lombardy (p=0.02) were associated also with higher IES-R scores, together with the presence of intestinal diseases (p=0.03), anxiety disorders (p<0.01), and worries about health (p<0.01). Conclusion: This nationwide study revealed a high impact of self-reported distress, anxiety, and perceived stress among rheumatic patients after confinement during COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Different factors were found to be predictive of poor mental health such as having female gender, younger age, living outside Lombardy, having overweight/obesity, or intestinal diseases, having a history of psychiatric symptoms (e.g. anxiety). Moreover, the lockdown experience worsened psychiatric symptoms and increased the assumption of psychopharmacotherapy in this vulnerable population. Prevention strategies focused on specific variables should be implemented to ameliorate psychological well-being of fragile patients during pandemics.","Ingegnoli, F.; Buoli, M.; Posio, C.; Di Taranto, R.; Lo Muscio, A.; Cumbo, E.; Ostuzzi, S.; Caporali, R.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,86,2

Lett. B {\bf808} (2020) 135643]. In this viewpoint, black hole entropy no longer obeys the area law and instead it can be given by $S\sim A^{1+\delta/2}$, where the exponent $\delta$ ranges $0\leq\delta\leq1$, and indicates the amount of the quantum-gravitational deformation effects. Based on this, and using the deep connection between gravity and thermodynamics, we disclose the effects of the Barrow entropy on the cosmological equations. For this purpose, we start from the first law of thermodynamics, $dE=TdS+WdV$, on the apparent horizon of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe, and derive the corresponding modified Friedmann equations by assuming the entropy associated with the apparent horizon has the form of Barrow entropy. We also examine the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics for the Universe enclosed by the apparent horizon. Finally, we employ the emergence scenario of gravity and extract the modified Friedmann equation in the presence of Barrow entropy which coincide with one obtained from the first law of thermodynamics. When $\delta=0$, the results of standard cosmology are deduced.","Sheykhi, Ahmad",,86,16

Higher input amounts of bacteriophage Phi6 are shown to delay and protect the phage from environmental decay, both when the phage are dried in plastic tubes, and when they are stored in saline solution at 4°C. When bacteriophage Phi6 are placed in LB (Luria-Bertani) growth medium prior to placement on the plastic surface, viral recovery is not influenced by the starting concentration. The protection is reflected in longer half-lives of the phage at higher concentrations compared to lower. Because experiments supporting the possibility of fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses rely upon survival of infectious virus following inoculation of various surfaces, high initial amounts of input virus on a surface may generate artificially inflated survival times compared to realistic lower levels of virus that a subject would normally encounter. This is not only because there are extra half-lives to go through at the higher concentrations, but also because the half-lives themselves are extended at the higher virus concentrations. It is important to design surface drying experiments for pathogens with realistic levels of input virus, and to consider the role of the carrier and matrix if the results are to be clinically relevant. IMPORTANCE During the COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of attention has been paid to the environmental decay of SARS-CoV-2 due to proposed transmission of the virus via fomites. However, published experiments have commenced with very high virus titer inoculums, an experimental design not representative of real-life conditions. The study described here evaluated the impact of initial virus titer on environmental decay of an enveloped virus, using a non-pathogenic surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, enveloped bacteriophage Phi6. We establish that higher concentrations of virus can protect the virus from environmental decay, depending on conditions. This has important implications for stability studies of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. Our results point to a limitation in the fundamental methodology that has been used to attribute fomite transmission for almost all respiratory viruses.","Bangiyev, Ronald; Chudaev, Maxim; Schaffner, Donald W.; Goldman, Emanuel",bioRxiv,86,26

Recent stats indicate that more than 140+ million confirmed cases are diagnosed globally as of April 2021. The cases are increasing day by day. The early and auto diagnosis helps people to be precautious. The proposed work aims to detect COVID-19 patients and Pneumonia patients from X-Rays which is one of the medical imaging modes to analyse the health of patient's lung inflammation. The suitable Convolutional Neural Network Model is selected for the identified dataset. The model detects COVID-19 patients and Pneumonia patients on the real-world dataset of lung X-Ray images. Images are pre-processed and trained for various classifications like Normal, COVID-19 and Pneumonia. After pre-processing, the detection of the disease is done by selecting the appropriate features from the images in each of the datasets. The result indicates that accuracy of detection of COVID vs Normal and COVID vs Pneumonia. Among those two, COVID vs Normal is with better accuracy than COVID vs Pneumonia. This method detects not only COVID or Pneumonia, but also the subtypes of Pneumonia as bacterial or Viral Pneumonia with 80% and 91.46% respectively.

Drawing from the concept of feminist sociological institutionalism, we argue that that the solutions directed at curbing COVID-19, which was led by a female health minister in Ontario, and a female health secretary in Scotland, did not conform to gendered expectations. While the gendering of institutions is often streamlined to achieve gender equality and consider female issues, the study shows that undivided attention was dedicated to curbing COVID-19, without opportunistic interference and taking advantage of a political window.","Soremi, T.; Dogo, S.",Policy Design and Practice,86,25

The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon by exploring the individual experiences of women who reported mistreatment during childbirth in Switzerland. Materials and Methods This project used a mixed methods approach to investigate women's experiences of mistreatment during childbirth in general and informal coercion specifically: the present qualitative study expands on the findings from a nationwide online survey on childbirth experience. It combines inductive with theory-guided thematic analysis to study the 7753 comments women wrote in the survey and the subsequent interviews with 11 women who reported being mistreated during childbirth. Results The women described a wide range of experiences of mistreatment during childbirth in both the survey comments and the interviews. Out of all survey participants who wrote at least one comment (n = 3547), 28% described one or more experiences of mistreatment. Six of the seven types of mistreatment listed in Bohren and colleagues' typology of mistreatment during childbirth were found, the most frequent of which were ineffective communication and lack of informed consent. Five further themes were identified in the interviews: informal coercion, risk factors for mistreatment, consequences of mistreatment, examples of good care, and what's needed to improve maternity care. Conclusion The findings from this study show that experiences of mistreatment are a reality in Swiss maternity care and give insight into women's individual experiences as well as how these affect them during and after childbirth. This study emphasises the need to respect women's autonomy in order to prevent mistreatment and empower women to actively participate in decisions. Both individual and systemic efforts are required to prevent mistreatment and guarantee respectful, dignified, and high-quality maternity care for all.","Meyer, S.; Cignacco, E.; Monteverde, S.; Trachsel, M.; Raio, L.; Oelhafen, S.",,86,26

In New Mexico, Pharmacist Clinicians (PhC) are uniquely fitted to aid ID physicians through additional training and licensing that allows for a collaborative practice model. Objectives The primary objective of this study is to describe the integration of a PhC with a rounding ID attending, utilizing an innovative practice model at an academic medical center, and report providers' views as related to this new position. Methods This was a survey study directed toward primary treating teams and ID attendings, conducted after six months of the creation of the PhC position. One survey was designed specifically for primary treating teams and another survey for ID attendings only. Primary team providers were identified through a log kept by the PhC for every patient intervention. All providers were contacted via e-mail using the REDCap system to evaluate the PhC's communication and ID knowledge by answering three to five multiple choice questions. A quantitative method was used for data analysis. Results Sixty-one (56.5%) providers responded to the surveys. Overall, primary team respondents gave a positive valuation of the position. ID attendings also generally approved of the position and had a similar view to that of the primary teams. The PhC was found to be effective by 92.5% of respondents. The lowest scoring area was the physical exam. There was no significant difference when comparing responses between primary teams and ID attendings. Conclusion An inpatient pharmacist clinician is able to manage complex ID patients to the satisfaction of both ID physicians and members of the primary treating teams in an academic medical center.","Cabanilla, M.

Genes and pathways that regulate ACE2 may facilitate/inhibit viral entry and replication, and genes and pathways that are controlled by ACE2 may be perturbed during infection, both affecting disease severity and outcomes. It is critical to understand how genes and pathways are associated with ACE2 in epithelial cells by leveraging proteomic data, but an accurate large-scale proteomic profiling at cellular resolution is not feasible at current stage. Therefore, we propose iProMix, a novel framework that decomposes bulk tissue proteomic data to identify epithelial cell component specific associations between ACE2 and other proteins. Unlike existing decomposition based association analyses, iProMix allows both predictors and outcomes to be impacted by cell type composition of the tissue and accounts for the impacts of decomposition variations and errors on hypothesis tests. It also builds in the functions to improve cell type estimation if estimates from existing literature are unsatisfactory. Simulations demonstrated that iProMix has well-controlled false discovery rate and large power in non-asymptotic settings with both correctly and mis-specified cell-type composition. We applied iProMix to the 110 adjacent normal tissue samples of patients with lung adenocarcinoma from Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium, and identified that interferon α and γ pathways were most significantly associated with ACE2 protein abundances in epithelial cells. Interestingly, the associations were sex-specific that the positive associations were only observed in men, while in women the associations were negative.","Song, Xiaoyu; Ji, Jiayi; Wang, Pei",bioRxiv,86,20

Social media use has been ambiguously related to loneliness, and associations may differ by age. The study aimed to examine loneliness and its association with social media use within different age groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia during April/May 2020, and 3,810 participants aged 18 years or above were recruited. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between social media use and social and emotional loneliness within separate age groups. Emotional loneliness was higher among young adults and among those who used social media several times daily. Adjusting by sociodemographic variables, using more types of social media was associated with lower social loneliness among the oldest participants, and with higher emotional loneliness among the youngest participants. Among middle-aged participants, using social media more frequently was associated with lower social loneliness. We found that the associations between social media use and loneliness varied by age. Older people’s engagement on social media may be a resource to reduce loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Older adults have particularly suffered during the pandemic, with increased health-related concerns and anxiety leading to increased vulnerability. However, little is known about the effects of the pandemic on older adults with cancer living in developing countries. They are facing issues related to their diagnosis and treatment, as well as the effects of the pandemic on their care and on the well-being of their families. To improve care for this vulnerable population, we studied the concerns and difficulties associated with COVID-19 among older Mexican adults with cancer. Methods: We included patients age ≥65 with the 10 most common tumors in Mexico according to GLOBOCAN and within 3-24 months of cancer diagnosis at two public hospitals in Mexico City. Patients were contacted telephonically and asked to complete a survey reporting the difficulties encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic and to rate their concerns associated with cancer care management using a 0-10 Likert-type scale, with higher ratings meaning increased concerns. Focused interviews were used to describe the individual experience of selected patients and their relatives related to COVID-19 and cancer care. Results: Between April 20, 2020 and December 1, 2021, 67 patients (mean age 71.9, min 65, max 90;35.8% female;62.7% living with a partner) were included. The most common tumors were prostate (43%), colon (16%), and lung (12%). 46% had Stage IV disease, and 61% had a life expectancy of more than a year. Twenty-five percent of patients reported encountering at least one difficulty in obtaining cancer care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 43% of the patients reported difficulties with accessing follow-up cancer care;39% reported issues with obtaining medications, including chemotherapy;and 34% reported problems obtaining medical care in general, including oncology visits. Regarding concerns, 33% of the patients reported being 'very worried' or 'extremely worried' about the COVID-19 pandemic. The most relevant concerns were related to getting infected with COVID-19 (or having a family member who became infected) (mean rating 7.9, SD 2.9);not being able to pay for cancer treatments or medical care (mean rating 6.9, SD 3.5);and worsening of cancer due to delayed care during the pandemic (mean rating 6.6, SD 3.7). Conclusions: A significant proportion of older adults with cancer in Mexico faced difficulties obtaining cancer treatment and followup care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their most relevant concerns included getting infected, financial losses, and progression of disease. Creating systems to provide continued cancer care for vulnerable populations in developing countries is essential to face the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sánchez-Román, S.; Guerra, Y. C.; Alfaro, A. M.

Objectives: To ascertain if there is SARS CoV 2 viral shedding in the saliva and faecal samples of Ghanaian COVID 19 patients, their sensitivity and specificity as compared to pharyngeal samples. Method: Fifty (50) recruited COVID 19 patients who have been confirmed via RT PCR using their nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples and twenty (20) SARS CoV 2 negative suspected patients each provided some faecal and saliva sample for RT PCR analysis for SARS CoV 2. Results: Forty three (43) out of the fifty (50) COVID 19 patients recruited representing 86% tested positive for SARS CoV 2 via their saliva sample whiles all their faecal samples tested positive for SARS CoV 2 representing 100%. The sensitivity of saliva samples was 86% whiles the specificity was 100% but the sensitivity and specificity of the faecal samples were all 100%.

Then, we group together the experimental segments associated with fast, slow, and normal POTP, and train a ML model to classify between these states based on a person's biomarkers. The classifier had a weighted average F-1 score of 79%, with the fast-passing time class having the highest F-1 score of 93%. Next, we classify each individual's POTP regardless of the task at hand, achieving an F-1 score of 77.1% when distinguishing time passing faster rather than slower than usual. In the two classifiers, biomarkers derived from the respiration, electrocardiogram, skin conductance, and skin temperature signals contributed most to the classifier output, thus enabling real-time POTP monitoring using noninvasive, wearable biosensors.","Orlandic, Lara; Valdes, Adriana Arza; Atienza, David",,86,7
184485,184485,184485,Controversies and uncertainties in managing SARS.,13.633243,9.072064,2003,"Background The 2020 ESC Taskforce guidelines made a level I recommendation for the use of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in patients with suspected myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA). CMR is a powerful diagnostic tool that can discriminate between myocardial infarction, Takostubo and myocarditis;myocardial oedema is best seen when a cardiac MR scan is carried out within 14 days of the initial Troponin positive event and normally subsides after 6 weeks. Access to CMR during the COVID pandemic year was restricted at the height of the pandemic. Purpose The purpose of this study was three fold. 1. To examine what proportion of patients with a rise and fall in Troponin and unobstructed coronary arteries were offered a CMR scan in our hospital during the year of 2020. 2. To examine the waiting times for a CMR scan during this year 3. To establish in what proportion of patients the CMR scan changed the diagnosis and management of the patients. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of all patients that presented to the Royal Berkshire Hospital with chest pain, a troponin rise and unobstructed coronaries on invasive angiogram between January and December of 2020. We collected data on demographics, the degree of troponin rise, echocardiography results, the discharge diagnosis and details of CMR findings (if performed). For quantitative data analysis, the number of days between presentation and CMR imaging was collated, as was the incidence of change of diagnosis and or management. Results Complete data was available for 104 patients who presented to the Royal Berkshire Hospital with chest pain between 6th January and 21st December 2020. All underwent coronary angiography. Of the patients included, 55.8% (58) were men and 44.2% (46) were women - all between 29 and 89 years of age. 61% of these patients had an ECHO as an inpatient, whilst a further 26% had a Vscan performed. Overall 87% of these patients had a Vscan or ECHO. Of the patients meeting the criteria, 31% of them received an inpatient (16%) or urgent outpatient (84%) CMR, with the average time between presentation and image being 47.3 days. Finally, 59% of diagnosis made on discharge were altered by findings on CMR, with 47% of management plans changed as a result of findings. Final diagnoses, following CMR, can be seen in figure 1. Subgroup analyses were performed on those that displayed initial raised troponins that remained static during admission, and those that received discharge diagnoses of Takotsubo or myocarditis/ pericarditis/ myopericarditis. Conclusions During 2020, the majority of patients (70%) with Troponin rise and unobstructed coronary arteries did not undergo CMR scanning in our hospital. Of the patients offered a CMR scan during the year of 2020, the scan changed the diagnosis in the majority of patients (59% ) but the wait for CMR was considerable (average of 47.3 days). This study suggests that in 2020, in our hospital the majority of patients may have ended up with suboptimal treatment following an admission with chest pain, troponin rise and unobstructed coronary arteries due to reduced access to CMR. This may be, in part, down to the impact of COVID on access to CMRs during the height of the pandemic.","Olubodun, O.; Azeez, S.; Dhera, K.; Shearman, H.; Elkington, A.; Bull, S.",Heart,86,7

Although CAR-T cell therapies are promising, there are concerns with commercial products regarding their affordability and sustainability. In this preliminary study, results of the first productional and clinical data of academic CAR-T cell (ISIKOK-19) from Turkey are presented. Materials and Methods: A pilot clinical trial (NCT04206943) designed to assess the safety and feasibility of ISIKOK-19 T-cell therapy in patients with relapsed and refractory CD19+ tumors was conducted and participating patients received ISIKOK-19 infusions between October 2019 and July 2021. Production data of the first 8 patients and the clinical outcome of 7 patients who received ISIKOK-19 cell infusion is presented in this study. Results: Nine patients were enrolled for the trial (ALL n=5 and NHL n=4) but only 7 patients could receive the treatment. Two out of three ALL patients and three out of four NHL patients had complete/partial response (ORR 72%). Four patients (57%) had CAR-T-related toxicities (CRS, CRES, and pancytopenia). Two patients were unresponsive and had progressive disease following CAR-T therapy. Two patients with partial response had progressive disease during follow-up. Conclusion: Production efficacy and fulfilling the criteria of quality control were satisfactory for academic production. Response rates and toxicity profiles are acceptable for this heavily pretreated/refractory patient group. ISIKOK-19 cells appear to be a safe, economical, and efficient treatment option for CD19 positive tumors.

Our aim was to examine the effectiveness and safety of TBT in this subset of patients. Methods: Data of IBD patients at 2 referral centers on TBT were extracted. The primary outcome was clinical response (>50% reduction in symptoms) at week 8 and/or 16 determined by Physician Global Assessment. Secondary outcome was clinical remission (resolution of symptoms), corticosteroid-free clinical response and remission, normalization of CRP and endoscopic/radiographic response and remission. Adverse events (AEs) including any abnormal lipid profile or surgical complications were also assessed. Results: Thirty-five patients (25UC, 10CD) were included. Biologics combined with tofacitinib were vedolizumab (68.6%), ustekinumab (17.1%), and infliximab (14.3%) and the median follow-up duration was 4 months. A majority (57.2%) had failed at least two biologics prior to starting TBT. At weeks 8 and/or 16, 37.1% achieved clinical response with 5.7% in clinical remission. Among the 23 patients with endoscopically/radiographically active disease at baseline, 56.5% had endoscopic/radiographic response and 34.8% achieved remission. Three AEs occurred in 2 (5.7%) patients, with an IR of 20.5 (15.0-47.2)/100PYF. No VTE and herpes zoster was reported. Conclusions: TBT is effective at inducing endoscopic/radiographic response and a modest clinical response in UC and CD patients with active clinical symptoms despite prior biologic monotherapy.

There is less research exploring how companion animals within the home impact upon mental health and wellbeing. This qualitative study explores people’s experiences of the role of their pets in reducing or exacerbating their mental health symptomology and general wellbeing. One hundred and nineteen adults, 41 with a diagnosed mental health condition, and 70 recently struggling with their mental health, completed an online survey with open and closed questions to explore their experiences of their pets and mental health. Through thematic analysis, seven key themes were identified. Six themes encompassed benefits of pets;increased hedonic tone;increased motivation and behavioral activation;reduced anxiety symptoms and panic attacks;increased social connections and reduced loneliness;reduced risk behaviors;and coping and aiding the recovery process. One theme encompassed negative impacts: increased negative feelings and emotional strain. Notably, pets reduced urges of self-harm, and prevented onsets of panic attacks and suicide attempts. Both direct mechanisms (e.g., lowering physiological anxiety through physical touch) and indirect mechanisms (e.g., elevating mood through humor, increased mindfulness and disrupting rumination) were identified. These findings encapsulate the complex roles that pets can play in people’s mental health and wellbeing, and highlights that even when the human–pet relationship is regarded positively, pets cannot “treat” mental health difficulties, and should not be viewed as such. Mental health practitioners should be aware and considerate of the importance of pets in people’s lives as well as individual differences in the potential capability of pets to both reduce or exacerbate mental health symptomology and overall wellbeing.","Hawkins, R.

Here we show that red blood cells (RBCs) serve as immune sensors through surface expression of the nucleic acid-sensing toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), a classically endosomal receptor that initiates immune responses following the detection of unmethylated CpG motifs present in pathogen and mitochondrial DNA. Mammalian RBCs express TLR9 on their surface and bind CpG-containing bacterial, malarial, and mitochondrial DNA. Erythrocyte-bound CpG DNA increases during infection, and CpG-carrying RBCs trigger accelerated erythrophagocytosis and innate immune activation characterized by RBC-TLR9 dependent local and systemic cytokine production. Thus, RBC nucleic acid detection and capture regulates red cell clearance and immune responses and provides evidence for RBCs as innate immune sentinels during pathologic states.

The outbreak was the result of the novel virus labeled as SARS-CoV-2, which spread to about 220 countries and caused approximately 3,311,780 deaths, infecting more than 159,319,384 people by May 12th, of 2021. The virus caused a worldwide pandemic leading to panic, quarantines, and lockdowns – although none of its predecessors from the coronavirus family have ever achieved such a scale. The key to understanding the global success of SARS-CoV-2 is hidden in its genome. Materials and Methods We retrieved data for 329,942 SARS-CoV-2 records uploaded to the GISAID database from the beginning of the pandemic until the 8th of January 2021. To process the data, a Python variant detection script was developed, using pairwise2 from the BioPython library. Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, were applied to visualize the data. Genomic coordinates were obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/). Sequence alignments were performed for every gene separately. Genomes less than 26,000 nucleotides long were excluded from the research. Clustering was performed using HDBScan. Results Here, we addressed the genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2 using 329,942 worldwide samples. The analysis yielded 155 genome variations (SNPs and deletions) in more than 0.3% of the sequences. Nine common SNPs were present in more than 20% of the samples. Clustering results suggested that a proportion of people (2.46%) were infected with a distinct subtype of the B.1.1.7 variant. The subtype may be characterized by four to six additional mutations, with four being a more frequent option (G28881A, G28882A, and G28883С in the N gene, A23403G in S, A28095T in ORF8, G25437T in ORF3a). Two clusters were formed by mutations in the samples uploaded predominantly by Denmark and Australia, which may indicate the emergence of “Danish” and “Australian” variants. Five clusters were linked to increased/decreased age, shifted gender ratio, or both. According to a correlation coefficient matrix, 69 mutations correlate with at least one other mutation (correlation coefficient greater than 0.7). We also addressed the completeness of the GISAID database, where between 77% and 93% of the fields were either left blank or filled incorrectly. Metadata mining analysis has led to a hypothesis about gender inequality in medical care in certain countries. Finally, we found ORF6 and E as the most conserved genes (96.15% and 94.66% of the sequences totally match the reference, respectively), making them potential targets for vaccines and treatment. Our results indicate areas of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that researchers can focus on for further structural and functional analysis.","Zelenova, Maria; Ivanova, Anna; Semyonov, Semyon; Gankin, Yuriy",bioRxiv,86,1

Each virus vigorously induced an NK cell infiltrate into the peritoneal cavity and liver, causing some redistributions of NK cell subsets defined by monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against Ly49A, C/I, D, and G2. Striking results were seen with a mAb (1F8) reactive with the positively signaling molecule Ly49H, present in MCMV-resistant C57BL/6 mice. mAb 1F8 also stains Ly49 C and I, but exclusion of those reactivities with mAb 5E6, which recognizes Ly49 C and I, indicated that Ly49H(+) cells infiltrated the peritoneal cavity and liver and were particularly effective at synthesizing interferon γ. Depletion of 1F8(+) but not 5E6(+) cells in vivo by mAb injections enhanced MCMV titers by 20-1,000-fold in the spleen and approximately fivefold in the liver. Titers of LCMV or VV were not enhanced. These anti-MCMV effects were attributed to prototypical NK1.1(+)CD3(−) NK cells and not to NK1.1(+)CD3(+) “NK/T” cells. This is the first evidence that control of a virus infection in vivo is mediated by a distinct NK cell subset.","Daniels, Keith A.; Devora, Gene; Lai, Wayne C.; O'Donnell, Carey L.; Bennett, Michael; Welsh, Raymond M.",J Exp Med,86,14

The most recent outbreak, now known as coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), has been on an exponential rise. Similar to its predecessors, COVID-19 causes a fatal form of pneumonia; however, in a small percentage of patients, COVID-19 has shown to cause neurological symptoms. Given that SARS-CoV and the new CoV strain share similar viral structures, COVID-19 may have the capability to invade the neurological system.

Formulating a regional mechanistic model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and frequently estimating parameters of this model using streaming surveillance data offers one way to accomplish data-driven decision making. For example, to detect an increase in new SARS-CoV-2 infections due to relaxation of previously implemented mitigation measures one can monitor estimates of the basic and effective reproductive numbers. However, parameter estimation can be imprecise, and sometimes even impossible, because surveillance data are noisy and not informative about all aspects of the mechanistic model, even for reasonably parsimonious epidemic models. To overcome this obstacle, at least partially, we propose a Bayesian modeling framework that integrates multiple surveillance data streams. Our model uses both COVID-19 incidence and mortality time series to estimate our model parameters. Importantly, our data generating model for incidence data takes into account changes in the total number of tests performed. We apply our Bayesian data integration method to COVID-19 surveillance data collected in Orange County, California. Our results suggest that California Department of Public Health stay-at-home order, issued on March 19, 2020, lowered the SARS-CoV-2 effective reproductive number $R_{e}$ in Orange County below 1.0, which means that the order was successful in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, subsequent ""re-opening"" steps took place when thousands of infectious individuals remained in Orange County, so $R_{e}$ increased to approximately 1.0 by mid-June and above 1.0 by mid-July.","Fintzi, Jonathan; Bayer, Damon; Goldstein, Isaac; Lumbard, Keith; Ricotta, Emily; Warner, Sarah; Busch, Lindsay M; Strich, Jeffrey R; Chertow, Daniel S; Parker, Daniel M; Boden-Albala, Bernadette; Dratch, Alissa; Chhuon, Richard; Quick, Nichole; Zahn, Matthew; Minin, Vladimir N",ArXiv,86,1

In an in vivo model, GL significantly attenuated goblet cell hyperplasia and MUC5AC mRNA expression in mice treated with lipopolysaccharide or interleukin-4. In addition, GL significantly attenuated MUC5AC protein and mRNA expression by tumor growth factor (TGF)-alpha in cultured NCI-H292 cells. GL also attenuated TGF-alpha-stimulated MUC5AC promoter activity in a luciferase reporter gene assay, but did not affect the stability of MUC5AC mRNA. Taken together, we concluded that GL has an inhibitory effect on mucus hyperproduction both in vivo and in vitro and that GL-mediated inhibition may be mediated through the inhibition of MUC5AC gene transcription.","Nishimoto, Yuki; Hisatsune, Akinori; Katsuki, Hiroshi; Miyata, Takeshi; Yokomizo, Kazumi; Isohama, Yoichiro",Journal of pharmacological sciences,86,16

While choices about genetic testing are increasingly common for patients and families, and public opinion surveys suggest public interest in genomics, it is not known how adults from the general population value genetic testing for heritable conditions. We sought to understand in a US sample the relative value of the characteristics of genetic tests to identify risk of hereditary colorectal cancer, among the first genomic applications with evidence to support its translation to clinical settings. METHODS . A Web-enabled choice-format conjoint survey was conducted with adults age 50 years and older from a probability-based US panel. Participants were asked to make a series of choices between 2 hypothetical blood tests that differed in risk of false-negative test, privacy, and cost. Random parameters logit models were used to estimate preferences, the dollar value of genetic information, and intent to have genetic testing. RESULTS . A total of 355 individuals completed choice-format questions. Cost and privacy were more highly valued than reducing the chance of a false-negative result. Most (97% [95% confidence interval (CI)], 95%-99%) would have genetic testing to reduce the risk of dying of colorectal cancer in the best scenario (no false negatives, results disclosed to primary care physician). Only 41% (95% CI, 25%-57%) would have genetic testing in the worst case (20% false negatives, results disclosed to insurance company). CONCLUSIONS . Given the characteristics and levels included in the choice, if false-negative test results are unlikely and results are shared with a primary care physician, the majority would have genetic testing. As genomic services become widely available, primary care professionals will need to be increasingly knowledgeable about genetic testing decisions.","Knight, Sara J; Mohamed, Ateesha F; Marshall, Deborah A; Ladabaum, Uri; Phillips, Kathryn A; Walsh, Judith M E",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,86,16

Whether the impairment was caused by SARS or pre-existing physical condition remains unclear. OBJECTIVE This study investigated the influence of SARS on exercise capacity and pulmonary function of previously healthy medical staff. METHODS Pulmonary function tests, including spirometry and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO), as well as symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) with an incremental protocol using an electronically braked cycle ergometer, were performed by 13 previously healthy hospital workers 14 months after SARS recovery. Other 14 age- and sex-matched healthy medical workers completed CPET simultaneously, and exercise capacities of these two groups were compared. RESULTS Most values of spirometry performed were within normal range. Only one showed mildly restrictive abnormality with decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 s (72.2% predicted) and forced vital capacity (68.1% predicted). Eight subjects had decreased DLCO levels (mean 79.37 +/- 7.73%), and low exercise capacity was noted in 9 subjects. Discordance in impairment of the measured DLCO and exercise capacity was revealed by comparison. Besides, there was no significant difference in results of CPET between subjects recovered from SARS and those never infected. CONCLUSIONS Minor pulmonary function defects as well as decreased exercise capacity were detected in previously healthy medical staff after recovering from SARS. No significant correlation between exercise capacity and pulmonary function was found.","Su, Mao-Chang; Hsieh, Yu-Tang; Wang, Yi-Hsi; Lin, An-Shen; Chung, Yu-Hsiu; Lin, Meng-Chih",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,86,16

The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a potential target for treatment of COVID-19 due to its critical role in maturation of viral proteins and subsequent viral replication. Conceptually and technically, targeting therapy against Mpro is similar to target therapy to treat cancer. Previous studies show that GC376, a broad-spectrum dipeptidyl Mpro inhibitor, efficiently blocks the proliferation of many animal and human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). Due to the conservation of structure and catalytic mechanism of coronavirus main protease, repurposition of GC376 against SARS-CoV-2 may be an effective way for the treatment of COVID-19 in humans. To validate this conjecture, the binding affinity and IC50 value of Mpro with GC376 was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, respectively. The results showed that GC376 binds to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro tightly (KD = 1.6 μM) and efficiently inhibit its proteolytic activity (IC50 = 0.89 μM). We also elucidate the high-resolution structure of dimeric SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with GC376. The cocrystal structure showed that GC376 and the catalytic Cys145 of Mpro covalently linked through forming a hemithioacetal group and releasing a sulfonic acid group. Because GC376 is already known as a broad-spectrum antiviral medication and successfully used in animal, it will be a suitable candidate for anti-COVID-19 treatment.","Wang, Yu-Chuan; Yang, Wen-Hao; Yang, Chia-Shin; Hou, Mei-Hui; Tsai, Chia-Ling; Chou, Yi-Zhen; Hung, Mien-Chie; Chen, Yeh",American journal of cancer research,86,33

The device is available in a range of diameters and geometries and is constructed from a single loop of NITINOL® wire. The 'Sphere' reduces aneurysm inflow by means of a high-density, patterned, elliptical surface that partially occludes the aneurysm neck. The device is secured in the healthy parent vessel by two armatures in the shape of open loops, resulting in negligible disruption of parent or daughter vessel flow. The device is virtually deployed in six anatomically accurate bifurcation aneurysms: three located at the Basilar tip and three located at the terminus bifurcation of the Internal Carotid artery (at the meeting of the middle cerebral and anterior cerebral arteries). Both steady state and transient flow simulations reveal that the device presents with a range of aneurysm inflow reductions, with mean flow reductions falling in the range of 30.6-71.8% across the different geometries. A significant difference is noted between steady state and transient simulations in one geometry, where a zone of flow recirculation is not captured in the steady state simulation. Across all six aneurysms, the device reduces the WSS magnitude within the aneurysm sac, resulting in a hemodynamic environment closer to that of a healthy vessel. We conclude from extensive CFD analysis that the 'Sphere' device offers very significant levels of flow reduction in a number of anatomically accurate aneurysm sizes and locations, with many advantages compared to current clinical cylindrical flow-diverter designs. Analysis of the device's mechanical properties and deployability will follow in future publications.","Peach, Thomas; Cornhill, J Frederick; Nguyen, Anh; Riina, Howard; Ventikos, Yiannis",Cardiovascular engineering and technology,86,1

The block to virus infection has been variously attributed to defects in virus receptors or virus spread. Since the cellular receptors for MHV, mmCGM1 and mmCGM2, have recently been identified as members of the carcinoembryonic antigen family, we reexamined the possible defectiveness of the MHV receptors in SJL mouse strain. Cloning and sequencing of the cDNAs of both mmCGMs RNAs from SJL mice revealed that they were identical in size to those of the susceptible C57BL/6 (B6) mouse. There was some sequence divergence in the N terminus of the mmCGM molecules between the two mouse strains, resulting in a different number of potential glycosylation sites. This was confirmed by in vitro translation of the mmCGM RNAs, which showed that the glycosylated mmCGM2 of SJL was smaller than that of B6 mice. However, transfection of either mmCGM1 or mmCGM2 from SJL mice into MHV-resistant Cos 7 cells rendered the cells susceptible to MHV infection. The ability of the SJL mmCGM molecules to serve as MHV receptors was comparable to that of those from B6. These molecules are expressed in SJL mouse brain and liver in a similar ratio and in amounts equivalent to those in the B6 mouse. Furthermore, we demonstrated that an SJL-derived cell line was susceptible to A59 but resistant to JHM infection. We concluded that the MHV receptor molecules in the SJL mouse are functional and that the resistance of SJL mice to infection by some MHV strains most likely results from some other factor(s) required for virus entry or some other step(s) in virus replication.","Yokomori, K; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,86,16

METHODS In this retrospective analysis, the clinical and biochemical characteristics of 135 patients who had died from SARS, 385 survivors of SARS and 19 patients with non-SARS pneumonia were compared. RESULTS All patients were treated according to a predefined protocol. Before steroid treatment, the mean FPG level was significantly higher in the SARS group (deceased vs. survivors vs. non-SARS pneumonia group: 9.7 +/- 5.2 vs. 6.5 +/- 3.0 vs. 5.1 +/- 1.0 mmol/l, P < 0.01). In the SARS group, the percentage of patients with a known history of diabetes was significantly higher in the deceased patients than in the survivors (21.5% vs. 3.9%, P < 0.01). Among patients with no known history of diabetes and before commencement of steroid therapy, those who had hypoxaemia (SaO(2) < 93%) had higher FPG levels than those who did not have hypoxia in both the survivor (8.7 +/- 4.9 vs. 6.3 +/- 2.1 mmol/l, P < 0.001) and deceased (9.8 +/- 4.8 vs. 7.2 +/- 1.5 mmol/l, P < 0.001) groups.

During the course of the illness, FPG levels were negatively associated with SaO(2) (beta =-0.682 +/- 0.305, P = 0.025, general estimation equation model) in SARS patients. Survival analysis showed that FPG was independently associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) of mortality (HR = 1.1, 95% CI 1.0, 1.1, P = 0.001) and hypoxia (HR = 1.1, 95% CI 1.0, 1.1, P = 0.002) after controlling for age and gender.

In this line, the intracellular bacteria that are able to survive and propagate within their host cells must have developed strategies to avert their host's killing attitude. Studying the interface of host-pathogen confrontation can provide valuable information for defining therapeutic approaches. Brucellosis, caused by the Brucella strains, is a zoonotic bacterial disease that affects thousands of humans and animals around the world inflicting discomfort and huge economic losses. Similar to many other intracellular dwelling bacteria, infections caused by Brucella are difficult to treat, and hence any attempt at identifying new and common therapeutic targets would prove beneficial for the purpose of curing infections caused by the intracellular bacteria. In THP-1 macrophage infected with Brucella melitensis we studied the expression levels of four host's genes, i.e. EMP2, ST8SIA4, HCP5 and FRMD5 known to be involved in pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Our data showed that at this molecular level, except for FRMD5 that was downregulated, the other three genes were upregulated by B. melitensis. Brucella melitensis and M. tuberculosis go through similar intracellular processes and interestingly two of the investigated genes, i.e. EMP2 and ST4SIA8 were upregulated in THP-1 cell infected with B. melitensis similar to that reported for THP-1 cells infected with M. tuberculosis.

In SARS CoV-infected cells, 10 sgRNAs, including 2 novel ones, were identified, which were predicted to be functional in the expression of 12 open reading frames located in the 3' one-third of the genome. Surprisingly, one new sgRNA could lead to production of a truncated spike protein. Sequence analysis of the leader-body fusion sites of each sgRNA showed that the junction sequences and the corresponding transcription-regulatory sequence (TRS) are unique for each species of sgRNA and are consistent after virus passages. For the two novel sgRNAs, each used a variant of the TRS that has one nucleotide mismatch in the conserved hexanucleotide core (ACGAAC) in the TRS. Coexistence of both plus and minus strands of SARS CoV sgRNAs and evidence for derivation of the sgRNA core sequence from the body core sequence favor the model of discontinuous transcription during minus-strand synthesis. Moreover, one rare species of sgRNA has the junction sequence AAA, indicating that its transcription could result from a noncanonical transcription signal.

Using synthetic biology, we engineered the spike protein (S) from a civet strain, SZ16, into our epidemic strain infectious clone, creating the chimeric virus icSZ16-S, which was infectious but yielded progeny viruses incapable of propagating in vitro. After introducing a K479N mutation within the S receptor binding domain (RBD) of SZ16, the recombinant virus (icSZ16-S K479N) replicated in Vero cells but was severely debilitated in growth. The in vitro evolution of icSZ16-S K479N on human airway epithelial (HAE) cells produced two viruses (icSZ16-S K479N D8 and D22) with enhanced growth on HAE cells and on delayed brain tumor cells expressing the SARS-CoV receptor, human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The icSZ16-S K479N D8 and D22 virus RBDs contained mutations in ACE2 contact residues, Y442F and L472F, that remodeled S interactions with hACE2. Further, these viruses were neutralized by a human monoclonal antibody (MAb), S230.15, but the parent icSZ16-S K479N strain was eight times more resistant than the mutants.

The type of mask and how to use it during physical exercise has generated controversy. This work aims to analyse the effect of the use of masks in the practice of high intensity physical exercise. METHODS An exploratory review was conducted by querying the PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and CUIDEN databases. RESULTS Respiratory physiology at rest and performing intense physical exercise was described, explaining how the use of masks during high-intensity physical exercise affects it in relation to gas exchange. CONCLUSIONS In case of intense physical exercise, the use of masks is not recommended because of the enhancing effect on PCO2. It would not allow the complete expulsion of the expired CO2 and would increase its concentration, along with the typical increase of the breathing rate during the exercise.","Robles-Romero, José Miguel; Conde Guillén, Gloria; Blanco Guillena, Manuel; Moreno Domínguez, Juan Francisco; Gómez-Salgado, Juan; Romero-Martín, Macarena",Revista espanola de salud publica,86,33

The most efficient vehicles for delivery of foreign genes to the target tissues are modified adenoviruses. Adenoviral vectors of the first generation, despite the high infection efficacy, have an essential drawback: they induce strong immune response, which leads to short term expression of the transgene, and limits their usefulness in clinical trials. In contrast, helper-dependent adenoviral vectors (HdAd) lacking all viral coding sequences display only minimal immunogenicity and negligible side-effects, allowing for long-term transgene expression. Thus, HdAd vehicles have become the carrier of choice for adenoviral vector-mediated experimental gene therapy, effectively used in animal models for delivery of transgenes into the liver, skeletal muscle, myocardium or brain. Strong and long-lasting expression of therapeutic genes has allowed for successful treatment of dyslipidemias, muscular dystrophy, obesity, hemophilia, and diabetes. Additionally, the large cloning capacity of HdAd, up to 37 kb, facilitates the use of physiologically regulated, endogenous promoters, instead of artificial viral promoter sequences. This enables also generation of the single vectors expressing multiple genes, which can be potentially useful for treatment of polygenic diseases. In this review we characterize the basic features of HdAd vectors and describe some of their experimental and potential clinical applications.","Józkowicz, Alicja; Dulak, Józef",Acta biochimica Polonica,86,1

The only way to prevent this disease is through vaccination before or after exposure. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of the Pasteur virus (PV) minigenome, using PV strain. MATERIALS AND METHODS Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) sequence was placed between the designed necessary elements (Hammerhead, HDV ribozyme, 3' Leader, and 5' Trailer sequences), which resemble the rabies virus PV strain (PV2061) genome and anti-genome. These constructs were placed between T7 polymerase promoter and T7 polymerase terminator sequences. The accuracy of the minigenome was confirmed by the expression of EGFP using the helper virus in T7-BHK cell line. RESULTS The viral necessary elements of positive and negative sense strands were evaluated for the ability of EGFP expression in the presence of the helper virus. While the positive strand showed background results, no EGFP background was observed in the negative strand application. CONCLUSION Establishment of minigenome system does not require advanced biosafety levels. Furthermore, using minigenome system eliminates many potential confounding factors that may be present in coding regions of the genome. Use of the minigenome system is easier and more feasible than the full genome rescue of the virus. This study successfully shows the efficiency of the constructed rabies virus minigenome in expression of inserted gene.","Ajorloo, Mehdi; Bamdad, Taravat; Gholami, Ali Reza; Azadmanesh, Keyhan",Archives of Iranian medicine,86,29

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients received sunitinib 37.5 mg (n = 86) or placebo (n = 85) on a continuous daily-dosing schedule until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events (AEs), or death. Patients completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 at baseline, Day 1 of every 4-week cycle, and end of treatment or withdrawal. Changes ≥10 points on each scale or item were deemed clinically meaningful. RESULTS Sunitinib had anti-tumor effects and improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo. The study was terminated early for this reason and because of more serious AEs and deaths with placebo. Baseline HRQoL scores were well balanced between study arms, and were generally maintained over time in both groups. In the first 10 cycles, there were no significant differences between groups in global HRQoL, cognitive, emotional, physical, role, and social functioning domains, or symptom scales, except for worsening diarrhea with sunitinib (p < 0.0001 vs. placebo). Insomnia also worsened with sunitinib (p = 0.0372 vs. placebo), but the difference was not clinically meaningful. CONCLUSION With the exception of diarrhea (a recognized side effect), sunitinib had no impact on global HRQoL, functional domains, or symptom scales during the progression-free period. Hence, in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, sunitinib provided a benefit in PFS without adversely affecting HRQoL.","Vinik, Aaron; Bottomley, Andrew; Korytowsky, Beata; Bang, Yung-Jue; Raoul, Jean-Luc; Valle, Juan W; Metrakos, Peter; Hörsch, Dieter; Mundayat, Rajiv; Reisman, Arlene; Wang, Zhixiao; Chao, Richard C; Raymond, Eric",Targeted oncology,86,1

This mechanism is mediated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that is homologous in sequence to the silenced gene. The dsRNA is processed into small interfering RNA (siRNA) by an enzyme called Dicer, and the siRNAs are then incorporated into a multi-component RNA-induced silencing complex, which finds and cleaves the target mRNA. In plants and worms, amplification of the silencing signal and cell-to-cell RNAi spreading is observed. The proposed biological roles of RNAi include resistance to viruses, transposons (mainly in plants), and the silencing and regulation of gene expression, particularly during development. In developmental gene control, specific small RNAs (micro RNA and small temporal RNA) are involved, which are processed in the same way as dsRNAs but act at the level of translation. RNAi technology has become a powerful tool in functional genomic analyses and may prove to be a useful method to develop highly specific gene-silencing therapeutics against viral infections and cancer in the future.","Stanisławska, Justyna; Olszewski, Waldemar L",Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis,86,5

In screening for anti-herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) candidates, we found GA active against HSV-1. HSV-1 replication in vitro was significantly inhibited by GA with an 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.093 microM and a concentration that inhibited cellular growth 50% in comparison with the results seen with untreated controls of 350 microM. The therapeutic index of GA was over 3700 (comparable to the results seen with acyclovir). GA did not inhibit HSV-1 thymidine kinase. Cells infected with HSV-1 demonstrated cell cycle arrest at the G(1)/S transition; however, treatment with GA resulted in a cell cycle distribution pattern identical to that of untreated cells, indicating a restoration of cell growth in HSV-1-infected cells by GA treatment. Accordingly, HSV-1 DNA synthesis was suppressed in HSV-1(+) cells treated with GA. The antiviral mechanism of GA appears to be associated with Hsp90 inactivation and cell cycle restoration, which indicates that GA exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Indeed, GA exhibited activities in vitro against other viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Since GA inhibits HSV-1 through a cellular mechanism unique among HSV-1 agents, we consider it a new candidate agent for HSV-1.","Li, Yu-Huan; Tao, Pei-Zhen; Liu, Yu-Zhen; Jiang, Jian-Dong",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,86,1

Comparative sequence analysis indicated that, like its coronavirus homologs, 3CL(pro) has a three-domain organization and is flanked by hydrophobic domains. The putative 3CL(pro) domain including flanking regions (pp1a residues 2793 to 3143) was fused to the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) and, when expressed in E. coli, was found to possess N-terminal autoprocessing activity that was not dependent on the presence of the 3CL(pro) C-terminal domain. N-terminal sequence analysis of the processed protein revealed that cleavage occurred at the location (2827)LVTHE downward arrow VRTGN(2836). The trans-processing activity of the purified recombinant 3CL(pro) (pp1a residues 2832 to 3126) was used to identify another cleavage site, (6441)KVNHE downward arrow LYHVA(6450), in the C-terminal pp1ab region. Taken together, the data tentatively identify VxHE downward arrow (L,V) as the substrate consensus sequence for the GAV 3CL(pro). The study revealed that the GAV and potyvirus 3CL(pro)s possess similar substrate specificities which correlate with structural similarities in their respective substrate-binding sites, identified in sequence comparisons. Analysis of the proteolytic activities of MBP-3CL(pro) fusion proteins carrying replacements of putative active-site residues provided evidence that, in contrast to most other 3C/3CL(pro)s but in common with coronavirus 3CL(pro)s, the GAV 3CL(pro) employs a Cys(2968)-His(2879) catalytic dyad. The properties of the GAV 3CL(pro) define a novel RNA virus proteinase variant that bridges the gap between the distantly related chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteinases of coronaviruses and potyviruses.","Ziebuhr, John; Bayer, Sonja; Cowley, Jeff A; Gorbalenya, Alexander E",Journal of virology,86,1

We rationally designed and synthesized a series of modified bombesin (BN) peptide analogs to study the influence of charge and spacers at the N-terminus, as well as amino acid substitutions, on both receptor binding affinity and pharmacokinetics. This enabled development of a novel (64/67)Cu-labeled BN peptide for PET imaging and targeted radiotherapy of BN receptor-positive tumors. Our results show that N-terminally positively charged peptide ligands had significantly higher affinity to human gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPr) than negatively charged or uncharged ligands (IC(50): 3.2±0.5 vs 26.3±3.5 vs 41.5±2.5 nM). The replacement of Nle(14) by Met, and deletion of D-Tyr(6), further resulted in 8-fold higher affinity. Contrary to significant changes to human GRPr binding, modifications at the N-terminal and at the 6(th), 11(th), and 14(th) position of BN induced only slight influences on affinity to mouse GRPr. [Cu(II)]-CPTA-[βAla(11)] BN(7-14) ([Cu(II)]-BZH7) showed the highest internalization rate into PC-3 cells with relatively slow efflux because of its subnanomolar affinity to GRPr. Interestingly, [(64/67)Cu]-BZH7 also displayed similar affinities to the other 2 human BN receptor subtypes. In vivo studies showed that [(64/67)Cu]-BZH7 had a high accumulation in PC-3 xenografts and allowed for clear-cut visualization of the tumor in PET imaging. In addition, a CPTA-glycine derivative, forming a hippurane-type spacer, enhanced kidney clearance of the radiotracer. These data indicate that the species variation of BN receptor plays an important role in screening radiolabeled BN. As well, the positive charge from the metallated complex at the N-terminal significantly increases affinity to human GRPr. Application of these observations enabled the novel ligand [(64/67)Cu]-BZH7 to clearly visualize PC-3 tumors in vivo. This study provides a strong starting point for optimizing radiopeptides for targeting carcinomas that express any of the BN receptor subtypes.","Zhang, Hanwen; Abiraj, Keelara; Thorek, Daniel L J; Waser, Beatrice; Smith-Jones, Peter M; Honer, Michael; Reubi, Jean Claude; Maecke, Helmut R",PloS one,86,28

Similarly, 'immunome-derived vaccines' are based on the concept that response to the subset of antigens and epitopes that interface with the host immune system (the immunome) and not the whole organism (represented by the proteome or genome) can be sufficient for protection. Competent immune responses to cancer are also probably restricted to the neoplasm's 'immunome', although the set of antigens that drive successful immune response to cancer cells has proven more difficult to uncover. Researchers are now using bioinformatics sequence analysis tools, epitope mapping tools, microarrays and high-throughput immunology assays to discover the components of the immunome, which are then used to compose these new vaccines.

Incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with noninfectious viral material such as inactivated virions or fixed, infected cells leads to early and strong IFN-alpha synthesis. Previous studies have shown that antibodies against the virus membrane glycoprotein M blocked the IFN induction and that two viruses with a mutated protein exhibited a decreased interferogenic activity, thus arguing for a direct involvement of M protein in this phenomenon. In this study, the IFN-alpha-inducing activity of recombinant M protein expressed in the absence or presence of other TGEV structural proteins was examined. Fixed cells coexpressing M together with at least the minor structural protein E were found to induce IFN-alpha almost as efficiently as TGEV-infected cells. Pseudoparticles resembling authentic virions were released in the culture medium of cells coexpressing M and E proteins. The interferogenic activity of purified pseudoparticles was shown to be comparable to that of TGEV virions, thus establishing that neither ribonucleoprotein nor spikes are required for IFN induction. The replacement of the externally exposed, N-terminal domain of M with that of bovine coronavirus (BCV) led to the production of chimeric particles with no major change in interferogenicity, although the structures of the TGEV and BCV ectodomains markedly differ. Moreover, BCV pseudoparticles also exhibited interferogenic activity. Together these observations suggest that the ability of coronavirus particles to induce IFN-alpha is more likely to involve a specific, multimeric structure than a definite sequence motif.","Baudoux, P; Carrat, C; Besnardeau, L; Charley, B; Laude, H",Journal of virology,86,1

Oligonucleotides that are complementary to a target mRNA, antisense oligonucleotides, can prevent translation either by cleaving the target or by physically blocking the process. Additionally, oligonucleotides can correct the undesired splicing of pre-mRNA. RNA interference using double-stranded oligoribonucleotides also results in cleavage of the target mRNA. Catalytically competent ribozymes and DNAzymes can have the same effect. Even with no RNA as target, oligonucleotides can be selected as aptamers to bind to any protein to inhibit its activity. Moreover, oligonucleotides can act as decoys particularly for transcription factors to prevent binding to the promoter. A different mode of action is the activation of Toll-like receptors to induce an immune response. Several pathways for drug development are still in their infancy, for example microRNAs and antagomirs.","Eckstein, Fritz",Expert opinion on biological therapy,86,20

This study aimed to evaluate the risk of outbreak in mass religious gathering and further to assess the preparedness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for preventing COVID-19 outbreak in this context. METHODS: The risk of COVID-19 outbreak in mass religious gathering was evaluated by using secondary COVID-19 cases and reproductive numbers. The preparedness of a series of NPIs for preventing COVID-19 outbreak in mass religious gathering was then assessed by using a density-dependent model. This approach was first illustrated by the Mazu Pilgrimage in Taiwan and validated by using the COVID-19 outbreak in the Shincheonji Church of Jesus (SCJ) religious gathering in South Korea. RESULTS: Through the strict implementation of 80% NPIs in the Mazu Pilgrimage, the number of secondary cases can be substantially reduced from 1508 (95% CI: 900-2176) to 294 (95% CI: 169-420) with the reproductive number (R) significantly below one (0.54, 95% CI: 0.31-0.78), indicating an effective containment of outbreak. The expected number of secondary COVID-19 cases in the SCJ gathering was estimated as 232 (basic reproductive number (R0) = 6.02) and 579 (R0 = 2.50) for the first and second outbreak, respectively, with a total expected cases (833) close to the observed data on high infection of COVID-19 cases (887, R0 = 3.00). CONCLUSION: We provided the evidence on the preparedness of NPIs for preventing COVID-19 outbreak in the context of mass religious gathering by using a density-dependent model.","Hsu, Chen-Yang; Chen, Ya-Mei; Su, Chiu-Wen; Ku, Mei-Sheng; Kim, Yeol; Jensen, Tim; Luh, Dih-Ling",J Formos Med Assoc,86,26

Although triphenyl phosphate (TPP), an OPFR, is a potential chemical determinant of liver function damage, its effects on kidney function in mice under high fructose/fat (HFF) diet are still unclear. In this study, C57BL/6J mice were fed HFF to generate an obesity model and mice were exposed to low dose (0.01 mg/kg/day; TPP-L) and high dose (1 mg/kg/day; TPP-H) of TPP for 12 weeks. Results showed that TPP-L and TPP-H combined with HFF, as well as TPP-H alone, caused kidney structural damage and gut microbiota disorders in mice. Inflammatory response induced by nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#954;B p65)/nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) and caspase-3 promoted kidney structure damage, as well as accumulation of triglyceride and total cholesterol and the protein residues in urine. Although TPP-L did not cause obvious structural damage in the kidneys, 0.01 mg/kg TPP induced significant inflammation and gut microbiota disorders.

The growing importance for securing such an ecosystem can be seen from DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks on e-learning components of the Croatian e-learning system. The negative impact of the conducted attack is visible in numerous users who were prevented from participating in and implementing the planned teaching process. Network anomalies such as conducted DDoS attacks were identified as one of the crucial threats to the e-learning systems. In this paper, an overview of the network anomaly phenomenon was given and botnets’ role in generating DDoS attacks, especially IoT device impact. The paper analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the e-learning systems in Croatia. Based on the conclusions, a research methodology has been proposed to develop a cyber-threat detection model that considers the specifics of the application of e-learning systems in crisis, distinguishing flash crowd events from anomalies in the communication network. The proposed methodology includes establishing a theoretical basis on DDoS and flash crowd event traffic, defining a laboratory testbed setup for data acquisition, development of DDoS detection model, and testing the applicability of the developed model on the case study. The implementation of the proposed methodology can improve the quality of the teaching process through timely DDoS detection and it gives other socio-economic contributions such as developing a specific research domain, publicly available dataset of network traffic, and raising the cyber-security of the e-learning systems.

The CCVAF framework uses information and communication technology (ICT) to assess climate change vulnerabilities among rural farmers by integrating both community level and individual household level indicators. The CCVAF was instantiated into a GIS-based web application named THRIVE for different decision-makers to better assess how climate change is affecting rural farmers in Western Honduras. Qualitative evaluation of the THRIVE showed that it is an innovative and useful tool. The CCVAF contributes to not only the knowledge base of the climate change vulnerability assessment but also the design science literature by providing guidelines to design a class of climate change vulnerability assessment solutions.","C'aceres, Claudia; Li, Yan; Hilton, Brian",,86,1

In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), its role may be of further importance because it is performed bedside and may limit chest X-ray and the need for transport to radiology for computed tomography (CT) scan. Since February 21, we progressively turned into a coronavirus-dedicated intensive care unit and applied an ultrasound-based approach to avoid traditional imaging and limit contamination as much as possible. We performed a complete daily examination with lung ultrasound score computation and systematic search of complications (pneumothorax, ventilator-associated pneumonia); on-duty physicians were free to perform CT or chest X-ray when deemed indicated. We compared conventional imaging exams performed in the first 4 wk of the COVID-19 epidemic with those in the same time frame in 2019: there were 84 patients in 2020 and 112 in 2019; 64 and 22 (76.2% vs. 19.6%, p < 0.001) had acute respiratory failure, respectively, of which 55 (85.9%) were COVID-19 in 2020. When COVID-19 patients in 2020 were compared with acute respiratory failure patients in 2019, the median number of chest X-rays was 1.0 (1.0-2.0) versus 3.0 (1.0-4.0) (pâ¯=â¯0.0098); 2 patients 2 (3.6%) versus 7 patients (31.8%) had undergone at least one thoracic CT scan (pâ¯=â¯0.001).

We sought to investigate the characteristics, inflammatory laboratory finding trends, and outcomes among critically ill Japanese patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with the first wave of COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed in a single institution in the center of Tokyo. Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU from March 19 to April 30, 2020 were included. Trends for significant inflammatory laboratory findings were analyzed. In-hospital death, days of mechanical ventilation or oxygen supplementation, days of ICU or hospital stay were followed until May 26, 2020. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were included. Median age was 57.5 years, and 79% were male. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was elevated to a median of 10.1 on admission and peaked on Day 10 of illness. Seventeen patients were intubated on Day 11 of illness and received mechanical ventilation. One patient underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

We assessed confirmed COVID-19 cases at an SNF impacted by COVID-19 in the United States to identify early indications of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We performed retrospective reviews of electronic health records for residents with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 during February 28-March 16, 2020. Records were abstracted for comorbidities, signs and symptoms, and illness outcomes during the 2 weeks before and after the date of positive specimen collection. Relative risks (RRs) of hospitalization and death were calculated. RESULTS: Of the 118 residents tested among approximately 130 residents from Facility A during February 28-March 16, 2020, 101 (86%) were found to test positive for SARS-CoV-2. At initial presentation, about two-thirds of SARS-CoV-2-positive residents had an abnormal vital sign or change in oxygen status. Most (90.2%) symptomatic residents had elevated temperature, change in mental status, lethargy, change in oxygen status, or cough; 9 (11.0%) did not have fever, cough, or shortness of breath during their clinical course. Those with change in oxygen status had an increased relative risk (RR) of 30-day mortality [51.1% vs 29.7%, RR 1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-3.0]. RR of hospitalization was higher for residents with underlying hepatic disease (1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.2) or obesity (1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1); RR of death was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings reinforce the critical role that monitoring of signs and symptoms can have in identifying COVID-19 cases early. SNFs should ensure they have a systematic approach for responding to abnormal vital signs and oxygen saturation and consider ensuring common signs and symptoms identified in Facility A are among those they monitor.","Tobolowsky, Farrell A; Bardossy, Ana C; Currie, Dustin W; Schwartz, Noah G; Zacks, Rachael L T; Chow, Eric J; Dyal, Jonathan W; Ali, Hammad; Kay, Meagan; Duchin, Jeffrey S; Brostrom-Smith, Claire; Clark, Shauna; Sykes, Kaitlyn; Jernigan, John A; Honein, Margaret A; Clark, Thomas A; Stone, Nimalie D; Reddy, Sujan C; Rao, Agam K",J.

We collected and analyzed the data of 117 patients who were laboratory confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection. The cases were divided into regular group, severe group and critically ill group according to the sixth edition scheme for COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment of China. The laboratory tests included blood routine, cellular and humoral immunity indices, biochemical detections and inflammatory biomarker. Compared with regular patients, severe and critically ill patients had significantly lower lymphocyte count (p < 0.01), decreased red blood cell and hemoglobin (p < 0.01), low levels of immunoglobulin G (p < 0.05) and significantly higher in D-dimer (p < 0.0001), fibrinogen (p < 0.01), white blood cell count (p < 0.01), neutrophil count (p < 0.0001), interleukin-6 (p < 0.05), C-reactive protein (p < 0.01), procalcitonin (p < 0.01), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p < 0.05), ferritin (p < 0.01) and lactate dehydrogenase (p < 0.0001). The specific immunoglobulin G antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 in severe and critically ill patients were significantly lower than that in regular patients (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that the lymphocyte counts, red blood cell counts and the immunoglobulin G antibodies of COVID-19 patients were impaired to varying degrees and the blood was in a state of hypercoagulation, which were more obvious in critically ill patients.","Yuan, Xiaohong; Huang, Wanling; Ye, Bing; Chen, Cunrong; Huang, Rongfeng; Wu, Feng; Wei, Qin; Zhang, Wei; Hu, Jianda",Int J Hematol,86,16

With regard to dermatology practice, we review various outbreak response measures to be followed by the dermatology staff at clinic in constrained environment. Preventive measures like social distancing, hand hygiene practices and protective measures such as introduction of personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff, standardization of clinical guidelines and continuing medical services via teleconsultation are recommended. Physical consultation has been limited to emergency-based services. Although teledermatology would never replace physical consultation, it might serve as an adjunctive role in providing adequate services to the non-emergent conditions and minimizes the risk of exposure of both doctors and patients. Non-urgent visits of the patients are being discouraged and elective dermatology procedures are being postponed. Dermatologists should also recognize and educate health care workers about primary cutaneous features of COVID-19 as well possible dermatological side effects arising from prolonged usage of PPE and hand hygiene practices. Limited office-based and in-patient services with a parallel increase in teledermatology consultations will allow effective dermatologic care and services to the public while ensuring minimum transmission of the virus.","Hanumanthu, Vinod Ashraf Raihan Sarkar Rashmi Kumaran Muthu",Pigment International,86,1

However, the bioanalysis of the active metabolites remdesivir nucleotide triphosphate (RTP) and its precursor remdesivir nucleotide monophosphate (RMP) is very challenging. Herein, we established a novel method to separate RTP and RMP on a BioBasic AX column and quantified them by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in positive electrospray ionization mode. Stepwise, we optimized chromatographic retention on an anion exchange column, improved stability in matrix through the addition of 5,5'-dithiobis-(2nitrobenzoic acid) and PhosSTOP EASYpack, and increased recovery by dissociation of tight protein binding with 2 % formic acid aqueous solution. The method allowed lower limit of quantification of 20 nM for RMP and 10 nM for RTP. Method validation demonstrated acceptable accuracy (93.6%-103% for RMP, 94.5%-107% for RTP) and precision (RSD < 11.9 % for RMP, RSD < 11.4 % for RTP), suggesting that it was sensitive and robust for simultaneous quantification of RMP and RTP. The method was successfully applied to analyze RMP and RTP in mouse tissues. In general, the developed method is suitable to monitor RMP and RTP, and provides a useful approach for exploring more detailed effects of remdesivir in treating diseases.","Hu, Wenjuan; Chang, Lu; Ke, Changqiang; Xie, Yuanchao; Shen, Jingshan; Tan, Bo; Liu, Jia",J Pharm Biomed Anal,86,1

METHODS: A mixed methods study with a survey in 323 NH practitioners (psychologists, elderly care physicians, nurse practitioners) in the Netherlands, and in-depth interviews in 16 NH practitioners. Nonparametric analyses were used to compare estimated proportions of residents with increased and with decreased challenging behavior. Content analyses were conducted for open-ended questions and in-depth interviews. RESULTS: Participants reported changes in challenging behavior with slightly higher proportions for increased (Q1/Mdn/Q3: 12.5%, 21.7%, 30.8%) than for decreased (8.7%, 14.8%, 27.8%, Z = -2.35, p = .019) challenging behavior. Half of the participants reported that their work load increased and work satisfaction worsened during the measures. Different strategies were described to respond to the effects of COVID-19 measures, such as video calls, providing special areas for residents to meet their loved ones, adjusting activities, and reducing the exposure to negative news. CONCLUSIONS: Because COVID-19 measures resulted in both increased and decreased challenging behavior in NH residents, it is important to monitor for their potential long lasting effects. Increased work load and worsened work satisfaction of the NH staff, together with the changes in type of challenging behavior, indicate that the harmful effects of the anti-pandemic measures should be taken seriously.","Leontjevas, Ruslan; Knippenberg, Inge A H; Smalbrugge, Martin; Plouvier, Annette O A; Teunisse, Saskia; Bakker, Christian; Koopmans, Raymond T C M; Gerritsen, Debby L",Aging Ment Health,86,31

COVID-19-related risk perception and knowledge may influence protective behaviour, and education could be an important determinant. The current study investigated differences by education level in risk perception, knowledge and protective behaviour regarding COVID-19 in Germany, exploring the development of the pandemic over time. The COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring study is a repeated cross-sectional online survey conducted during the pandemic in Germany from 3 March 2020 (waves 1-28: 27,957 participants aged 18-74). Differences in risk perception, knowledge and protective behaviour according to education level (high versus low) were analysed using linear and logistic regression. Time trends were accounted for by interaction terms for education level and calendar week. Regarding protective behaviour, interaction terms were tested for all risk perception and knowledge variables with education level. The strongest associations with education level were evident for perceived and factual knowledge regarding COVID-19. Moreover, associations were found between low education level and higher perceived severity, and between low education level and lower perceived probability. Highly educated men were more worried about COVID-19 than those with low levels of education. No educational differences were observed for perceived susceptibility or fear. Higher compliance with hand washing was found in highly educated women, and higher compliance with maintaining distance was found in highly educated men. Regarding maintaining distance, the impact of perceived severity differed between education groups. In men, significant moderation effects of education level on the association between factual knowledge and all three protective behaviours were found. During the pandemic, risk perception and protective behaviour varied greatly over time. Overall, differences by education level were relatively small. For risk communication, reaching all population groups irrespective of education level is critical.","Rattay, Petra; Michalski, Niels; Domanska, Olga Maria; Kaltwasser, Anna; De Bock, Freia; Wieler, Lothar H; Jordan, Susanne",PLoS One,86,1

Injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) served as a model for inflammatory pain. The CFA injection decreased the thermal thresholds in both sexes but only the male mice showed increased anxiety-like behavior and diminished cognition, while the females were not affected. Increased calcium fluorescence, a marker for neuronal activity, was detected by photometry in the mPFC of males but not in females with CFA. Next, while chemogenetic inhibition of the projections from the mPFC to the LC improved the object recognition memory of males with pain, the inhibition of the mPFC to LC pathway in female mice produced anxiolysis and spatial memory deficits. The behavior results prompted us to compare the reciprocal innervation of mPFC and LC between the sexes. We used an anterograde transsynaptic tagging technique, which relies on postsynaptic cre transfer, to assess the innervation of LC by mPFC efferents. The males showed a higher rate of postsynaptic cre transfer into LC neurons from mPFC efferents than the females. And vice versa, a retrograde tracing experiment demonstrated that LC to mPFC projection neurons were more numerous in females when compared to males. In conclusion, we provide evidence that subtle differences in the reciprocal neuronal circuit between the LC and mPFC may contribute to sex differences associated with the adverse cognitive effects of inflammatory pain.","Cardenas, Andrea; Papadogiannis, Alexander; Dimitrov, Eugene",FASEB J,86,24

The authors encountered three patients with COVID-19 who presented with erythema and suspected viral rash. In all cases, erythema appeared after the onset of the initial symptoms of COVID-19. Erythema was considered to be caused by COVID-19 and not a drug-induced eruption because, in all cases, erythema was relieved merely by external medicine and oral antihistamines, without discontinuing the original medication. The authors' hospital accepted 69 COVID-19 patients between 22 February 2020 and 31 May 2020 and, of these, three (4.3%) exhibited eruptions, and all cases presented erythema. Except for seven patients who exhibited positive nasopharyngeal swab tests for SARS-CoV-2 RNA but no symptoms, three (4.8%) of the remaining 62 patients exhibited erythema. Although various types of eruptions have been reported in patients with COVID-19, erythema was the only type in our patients. Erythema in the three patients exhibited many similarities to that previously reported in COVID-19 patients, particularly in the manner it appeared and disappeared. For these reasons, these three cases were considered typical examples of erythema in patients with COVID-19. Considering previous studies and the three cases reported here, there is a high probability that SARS-CoV-2 can cause erythema.","Tamai, Masakazu; Maekawa, Aya; Goto, Noriko; Ge, Lindun; Nishida, Tsutomu; Iwahashi, Hiromi; Yokomi, Akinori",J. dermatol,86,33

As a result that these tests cannot be done in local clinics where RT-qPCR testing capability is lacking, rapid antigen tests (RATs) for COVID-19 based on lateral flow immunoassays are used for rapid diagnosis. However, their sensitivity compared with each other and with RT-qPCR and infectious virus isolation has not been examined. Here, we compared the sensitivity among four RATs by using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolates and several types of COVID-19 patient specimens and compared their sensitivity with that of RT-qPCR and infectious virus isolation. Although the RATs read the samples containing large amounts of virus as positive, even the most sensitive RAT read the samples containing small amounts of virus as negative. Moreover, all RATs tested failed to detect viral antigens in several specimens from which the virus was isolated. The current RATs will likely miss some COVID-19 patients who are shedding infectious SARS-CoV-2.","Yamayoshi, Seiya; Sakai-Tagawa, Yuko; Koga, Michiko; Akasaka, Osamu; Nakachi, Ichiro; Koh, Hidefumi; Maeda, Kenji; Adachi, Eisuke; Saito, Makoto; Nagai, Hiroyuki; Ikeuchi, Kazuhiko; Ogura, Takayuki; Baba, Rie; Fujita, Kensuke; Fukui, Takahiro; Ito, Fumimaro; Hattori, Shin-Ichiro; Yamamoto, Kei; Nakamoto, Takato; Furusawa, Yuri; Yasuhara, Atsuhiro; Ujie, Michiko; Yamada, Shinya; Ito, Mutsumi; Mitsuya, Hiroaki; Omagari, Norio; Yotsuyanagi, Hiroshi; Iwatsuki-Horimoto, Kiyoko; Imai, Masaki; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro",Viruses,86,25

Attenuated vaccines have proven their potential to induce strong and long-lasting immune responses. We have previously described that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) envelope (E) protein is a virulence factor. Based on this knowledge, a collection of mutants carrying partial deletions spanning the C-terminal domain of the E protein (rMERS-CoV-E*) has been generated using a reverse genetics system. One of these mutants, MERS-CoV-E*&#916;2in, was attenuated and provided full protection in a challenge with virulent MERS-CoV after a single immunization dose. The MERS-CoV-E*&#916;2in mutant was stable as it maintained its attenuation after 16 passages in cell cultures and has been selected as a promising vaccine candidate.IMPORTANCE The emergence of the new highly pathogenic human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that has already infected more than 80 million persons, killing nearly two million of them, clearly indicates the need to design efficient and safe vaccines protecting from these coronaviruses. Modern vaccines can be derived from virus-host interaction research directed to the identification of signaling pathways essential for virus replication and for virus-induced pathogenesis, in order to learn how to attenuate these viruses and design vaccines. Using a reverse genetics system developed in our laboratory, an infectious cDNA clone of MERS-CoV was engineered. Using this cDNA, we sequentially deleted several predicted and conserved motifs within the envelope (E) protein of MERS-CoV, previously associated with the presence of virulence factors. The in vitro and in vivo evaluation of these deletion mutants highlighted the relevance of predicted linear motifs in viral pathogenesis. Two of them, an Atg8 protein binding motif (Atg8-BM), and a forkhead-associated binding motif (FHA-BM), when deleted, rendered an attenuated virus that was evaluated as a vaccine candidate, leading to full protection against challenge with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV. This approach can be extended to the engineering of vaccines protecting against the new pandemic SARS-CoV-2.","Gutiérrez-Álvarez, Javier; Honrubia, José M; Fernández-Delgado, Raúl; Wang, Li; Castaño-Rodríguez, Carlos; Zúñiga, Sonia; Sola, Isabel; Enjuanes, Luis",mBio (Online),86,1

There is an urgent need for effective drugs or vaccines which can effectively combat this outbreak. The main protease (Mpro), a key component for the SARS CoV-2 replication, is considered to be one of the important drug targets for developing anti-COVID-19 drugs. This SARS CoV-2 Mpro/cysteine protease has high sequence similarity with the same protease from SARS CoV-1. Previously, it has been shown experimentally that eight diterpenoids and four biflavonoids derived from the leaf of Torreya nucifera show inhibitory effect on the cleavage/catalytic activity of the SARS CoV-1 Mpro. But whether these phytochemicals exhibit any inhibitory effect on SARS CoV-2 Mpro is unclear. To understand this fact, here, we have adopted various in-silico approaches. Diterpenoids and biflavonoids those qualified pharmacological test (hinokiol, amentoflavone, bilobetin and ginkgetin) and two well-known Mpro inhibitors (N3 and lopinavir) were subjected for molecular docking studies. Only three biflavonoids (amentoflavone, bilobetin and ginkgetin) were selected by comparing their binding affinities with N3 and lopinavir. They interacted with two most important catalytic residues of Mpro (His41 and Cys145). Molecular dynamics studies further revealed that these three Mpro-biflavonoid complexes are highly stable and share a similar degree of compactness. Besides, these complexes experience less conformational fluctuations and more expansion than Mpro-N3 and/or Mpro-lopinavir complex. MM-GBSA and H-bond analysis further corroborated these findings. Altogether, our study suggested that these three biflavonoids could possibly inhibit the proteolytic/catalytic activity of SARS CoV-2 Mpro and might be useful for COVID-19 treatment.

The receptor-binding motif (RBM) region of the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), binds to host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors for infection. As ACE2 receptors are highly conserved within vertebrate species, SARS-CoV-2 can infect significant animal species as well as human populations. An analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes isolated from human and significant animal species was conducted to compare and identify mutation and adaptation patterns across different animal species. The phylogenetic data revealed seven distinct phylogenetic clades with no significant relationship between the clades and geographical locations. A high rate of variation within SARS-CoV-2 mink isolates implies that mink populations were infected before human populations. Positions of most single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes from the different hosts are mostly accumulated in the RBM region and highlight the pronounced accumulation of variants with mutations in the RBM region in comparison with other variants. These SNPs play a crucial role in viral transmission and pathogenicity and are keys in identifying other animal species as potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. The possible roles in the emergence of new viral strains and the possible implications of these changes, in compromising vaccine effectiveness, deserve urgent considerations.","Ghorbani, Abozar; Samarfard, Samira; Eskandarzade, Neda; Afsharifar, Alireza; Eskandari, Mohammad Hadi; Niazi, Ali; Izadpanah, Keramatollah; Karbanowicz, Thomas P",Brief. bioinform,86,32

We aimed to describe the impact of the initial wave of the pandemic on admissions, care quality, and outcomes in patients with acute stroke in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Registry-based cohort study of patients with acute stroke admitted to hospital in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland between October 1, 2019, and April 30, 2020, and equivalent periods in the 3 prior years. RESULTS: One hundred fourteen hospitals provided data for a study cohort of 184 017 patients. During the lockdown period (March 23 to April 30), there was a 12% reduction (6923 versus 7902) in the number of admissions compared with the same period in the 3 previous years. Admissions fell more for ischemic than hemorrhagic stroke, for older patients, and for patients with less severe strokes. Quality of care was preserved for all measures and in some domains improved during lockdown (direct access to stroke unit care, 1-hour brain imaging, and swallow screening). Although there was no change in the proportion of patients discharged with good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, &#8804;2; 48% versus 48%), 7-day inpatient case fatality increased from 6.9% to 9.4% (P<0.001) and was 22.0% in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (adjusted rate ratio, 1.41 [1.11-1.80]). CONCLUSIONS: Assuming that the true incidence of acute stroke did not change markedly during the pandemic, hospital avoidance may have created a cohort of untreated stroke patients at risk of poorer outcomes or recurrent events. Unanticipated improvements in stroke care quality should be used as an opportunity for quality improvement and to learn about how to develop resilient health care systems.","Douiri, Abdel; Muruet, Walter; Bhalla, Ajay; James, Martin; Paley, Lizz; Stanley, Kaili; Rudd, Anthony G; Wolfe, Charles D A; Bray, Benjamin D",Stroke,86,1

Cutaneous manifestations have been classified into 5 clinical patterns: acro-ischemic (pseudo-chilblain), vesicular, urticarial, maculopapular, and livedoid. Oral manifestations have also been reported, but much less frequently. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study in which we examined the oral mucosa of 666 patients with COVID-19 at the IFEMA field hospital in Madrid in April 2020. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients (11.7%) had changes involving the oral mucosa. The most common were transient anterior U-shaped lingual papillitis (11.5%) accompanied or not by tongue swelling (6.6%), aphthous stomatitis (6.9%), a burning sensation in the mouth (5.3%), mucositis (3.9%), glossitis with patchy depapillation (3.9%), white tongue (1.6%), and enanthema (0.5%). Most of the patients also reported taste disturbances. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 also manifests in the oral cavity. The most common manifestations are transient U-shaped lingual papillitis, glossitis with patchy depapillation, and burning mouth syndrome. Mucositis with or without aphthous ulcers or enanthema may also be observed.

The leading cause of death among COVID-19 patients is acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by hyperinflammation secondary to cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, interleukin-6, interferon-Î³ and interleukin-10, are the main mediators of CRS. Based on recent evidence, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) II is known to be the target of the COVID-19 spike protein, which enables the virus to penetrate human cells. ACE II also possesses an anti-inflammatory role in many pathologies such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and other conditions, which are the main risk factors of poor prognosis in COVID-19 infection. Changes in tissue ACE II levels are associated with many diseases and hyperinflammatory states, and it is assumed that elevated levels of ACE II could aggravate the course of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RASis) in COVID-19 patients could be hypothetically considered, though sufficient evidence is not presented by the scientific community.

To trace the evolution route and probe the transmission dynamics of this virus, we performed phylodynamic analysis of 247 high quality genomic sequences available in the GISAID platform as of 5 March 2020. Among them, four genetic clusters, defined as super-spreaders (SSs), could be identified and were found to be responsible for the major outbreaks that subsequently occurred in various countries. SS1 was widely disseminated in Asia and the US, and mainly responsible for outbreaks in the states of Washington and California as well as South Korea, whereas SS4 contributed to the pandemic in Europe. Using the signature mutations of each SS as markers, we further analysed 1539 genome sequences reported after 29 February 2020 and found that 90% of these genomes belonged to SSs, with SS4 being the most dominant. The relative degree of contribution of each SS to the pandemic in different continents was also depicted. Identification of these super-spreaders greatly facilitates development of new strategies to control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Yang, Xuemei; Dong, Ning; Chan, Edward Wai-Chi; Chen, Sheng",Emerg Microbes Infect,86,1

Zoonotic transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus caused the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which led to over 2 million deaths worldwide. Elevated inflammatory responses and cytotoxicity in the lungs are associated with COVID-19 severity in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Bats, which host pathogenic CoVs, operate dampened inflammatory responses and show tolerance to these viruses with mild clinical symptoms. Delineating the mechanisms governing these host-specific inflammatory responses is essential to understand host-virus interactions determining the outcome of pathogenic CoV infections. Here, we describe the essential role of inflammasome activation in determining COVID-19 severity in humans and innate immune tolerance in bats that host several pathogenic CoVs. We further discuss mechanisms leading to inflammasome activation in human SARS-CoV-2 infection and how bats are molecularly adapted to suppress these inflammasome responses. We also report an analysis of functionally important residues of inflammasome components that provide new clues of bat strategies to suppress inflammasome signaling and innate immune responses. As spillover of bat viruses may cause the emergence of new human disease outbreaks, the inflammasome regulation in bats and humans likely provides specific strategies to combat the pathogenic CoV infections.","Nagaraja, Sahana; Jain, Disha; Kesavardhana, Sannula",J. leukoc. biol,86,21

Here, we describe the discovery of a class of HCoV inhibitors acting on nsp15, a hexameric protein component of the viral replication-transcription complexes, endowed with immune evasion-associated endoribonuclease activity. Structure-activity relationship exploration of these 1,2,3-triazolo-fused betulonic acid derivatives yielded lead molecule 5h as a strong inhibitor (antiviral EC50: 0.6 µM) of HCoV-229E replication. An nsp15 endoribonuclease active site mutant virus was markedly less sensitive to 5h, and selected resistance to the compound mapped to mutations in the N-terminal part of HCoV-229E nsp15, at an interface between two nsp15 monomers. The biological findings were substantiated by the nsp15 binding mode for 5h, predicted by docking. Hence, besides delivering a distinct class of inhibitors, our study revealed a druggable pocket in the nsp15 hexamer with relevance for anti-coronavirus drug development.","Stevaert, Annelies; Krasniqi, Besir; Van Loy, Benjamin; Nguyen, Tien; Thomas, Joice; Vandeput, Julie; Jochmans, Dirk; Thiel, Volker; Dijkman, Ronald; Dehaen, Wim; Voet, Arnout; Naesens, Lieve",J Med Chem,86,31

Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) can deliver results rapidly and at scale, but have widely varying accuracy. METHODS: In a laboratory setting, we performed head-to-head comparisons of four LFIAs: the Rapid Test Consortium's AbC-19TM Rapid Test, OrientGene COVID IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, SureScreen COVID-19 Rapid Test Cassette, and Biomerica COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test. We analysed blood samples from 2,847 key workers and 1,995 pre-pandemic blood donors with all four devices. FINDINGS: We observed a clear trade-off between sensitivity and specificity: the IgG band of the SureScreen device and the AbC-19TM device had higher specificities but OrientGene and Biomerica higher sensitivities. Based on analysis of pre-pandemic samples, SureScreen IgG band had the highest specificity (98.9%, 95% confidence interval 98.3 to 99.3%), which translated to the highest positive predictive value across any pre-test probability: for example, 95.1% (95% uncertainty interval 92.6, 96.8%) at 20% pre-test probability. All four devices showed higher sensitivity at higher antibody concentrations (""spectrum effects""), but the extent of this varied by device. INTERPRETATION: The estimates of sensitivity and specificity can be used to adjust for test error rates when using these devices to estimate the prevalence of antibody. If tests were used to determine whether an individual has SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, in an example scenario in which 20% of individuals have antibodies we estimate around 5% of positive results on the most specific device would be false positives.

Epidemiologists predicted that the SARS-Cov 2 pandemic would not be able to be brought under control until a majority of the world's population had been inoculated with safe and effective vaccines. A world-wide effort to expedite vaccine development was successful. Previous research for vaccines to prevent SARS and MERS, also coronaviruses, was vital to this success. Nanotechnology was essential to this vaccine development. Key elements are presented here to better understand the relationship between nanomedicine and the COVID-19 vaccine development. METHODS: NLM PubMed searches for COVID-19 vaccines, nanotechnology and nanomedicine were done. There were 6911 articles screened, 235 of which were deemed appropriate to this subject and utilized here, together with two landmark nanomedicine texts used to expand understanding of the basic science of nanotechnology. RESULTS: SARS-Cov 2, caused by the COVID-19 virus, was first recognized in China in December of 2019 and was declared as a pandemic in March of 2020. The RNA sequence was identified in January of 2020. Within 4 months of the viral genome being released, over 259 vaccines had been in development. The World Health Organization (WHO) anticipated a vaccine with a 50-80% efficacy to be developed within 1-2 years. Ahead of schedule, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the emergency authorization approval for two mRNA vaccines within 11 month's time. Nanotechnology was the key to the success of these rapidly developed, safe and effective vaccines. A brief review of pertinent basic science principles of nanomedicine are presented. The development of COVID vaccines is reviewed. Future considerations are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Control of the COVID-19 SARS-Cov2 pandemic benefitted from nanomedicine principles used to develop highly effective, yet very safe and relatively inexpensive vaccines. These nanovaccines can be much more easily altered to adjust for viral variants than traditional live or inactivated legacy-type whole virus vaccines.","Shapiro, Robert S",Int. j. dermatol,86,27

Oman is no exception to this, with several studies indicating high levels of anxiety and depression among the Omani public. There is a need for adaptive and effective interventions that aim to improve the elevated levels of psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to comparatively assess the efficacy of therapist-guided online therapy with that of self-help, internet-based therapy focusing on COVID-19-induced symptoms of anxiety and depression among individuals living in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a 6-week-long pragmatic randomized controlled trial involving 60 participants who were recruited from a study sample surveyed for symptoms of anxiety or depression among the Omani public amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants in the intervention group were allocated to receive 1 online session per week for 6 weeks from certified psychotherapists in Oman; these sessions were conducted in Arabic or English. The psychotherapists utilized cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy interventions. Participants in the control group received an automatic weekly newsletter via email containing self-help information and tips to cope with distress associated with COVID-19. The information mainly consisted of behavioral tips revolving around the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy. The primary outcome was measured by comparing the change in the mean scores of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale from the baseline to the end of the study (ie, after 6 sessions) between the two groups. The secondary outcome was to compare the proportions of participants with depression and anxiety between the two groups. RESULTS: Data from 46 participants were analyzed (intervention group n=22, control group n=24). There was no statistical difference in the baseline characteristics between both groups. Analysis of covariance indicated a significant reduction in the GAD-7 scores (F1,43=7.307; P=.01) between the two groups after adjusting for baseline scores. GAD-7 scores of participants in the intervention group were considerably more reduced than those of participants in the control group (ß=-3.27; P=.01). Moreover, a greater reduction in mean PHQ-9 scores was observed among participants in the intervention group (F1,43=8.298; P=.006) than those in the control group (ß=-4.311; P=.006). Although the levels of anxiety and depression reduced in both study groups, the reduction was higher in the intervention group (P=.049) than in the control group (P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence to support the efficacy of online therapy for improving the symptoms of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 crisis in Oman. Therapist-guided online therapy was found to be superior to self-help, internet-based therapy; however, both therapies could be considered as viable options.

DESIGN: Cohort study of women delivering between 1 January 2016 and 1 July 2020. SETTING: London Teaching Hospital. POPULATION: All women delivering between 1 January 2016 and 13 May 2020 and follow up of women screening negative between 1 April 2020 and 13 May 2020. METHODS: Retrospective study of prospectively collected data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detection rate of gestational diabetes. RESULTS: Using the RCOG guidance, the overall rate of women identified as having gestational diabetes fell from 7.7% (1853/24168) to 4.2% (35/831)(P = 0.0003). Of 230 women who tested negative according to the RCOG criteria from 1 April to 13 May but who subsequently had an oral glucose tolerance test, 47 (20.4%) were diagnosed as having gestational diabetes according to the NICE criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In our setting, the RCOG Covid-19 gestational diabetes screening regime failed to detect 47 of 82 (57%) women subsequently identified as gestational diabetics, and therefore cannot be recommended for general use.

A total of 73,953,702 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1,644,416 deaths were reported globally up to December 17, 2020. Therefore, in the absence of a safe and effective vaccine, it is urgent to identify a novel antiviral drug to effectively treat patients with COVID-19. On October 22, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved remdesivir, a nucleotide analog prodrug with broad antiviral activity, for adults and children (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg) who need to be admitted to hospital for covid-19 treatment. In order to monitor the optimization of patient clinical response profile, as well as address the challenges associated with remdesivir metabolism, highly sensitive, selective and accurate analytical methods are necessary. This review clearly covers all the analytical methods developed for the identification and quantitative determination of remdesivir and its metabolites in biological matrices, which helps the researchers in developing new methods for the analysis of remdesivir by considering the pros and cons of the previously reported methods.","Pashaei, Yaser",Drug Discov Ther,86,24

We tested reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), a method which can produce results in under 30 min, alongside standard methods in a real-life clinical setting. METHODS: This prospective service improvement project piloted an RT-LAMP method on nasal and pharyngeal swabs on 21 residents of a high dependency care home, with two index COVID-19 cases, and compared it to multiplex tandem reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We recorded vital signs of patients to correlate clinical and laboratory information and calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of a single swab using RT-LAMP compared with the current standard, RT-PCR, as per Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) guidelines. RESULTS: The novel method accurately detected 8/10 RT-PCR positive cases and identified a further 3 positive cases. Eight further cases were negative using both methods. Using repeated RT-PCR as a ""gold standard"", the sensitivity and specificity of a single novel test were 80 and 73% respectively. PPV was 73% and NPV was 83%. Incorporating retesting of low signal RT-LAMP positives improved the specificity to 100%. We also speculate that hypothermia may be a significant early clinical sign of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: RT-LAMP testing for SARS-CoV-2 was found to be promising, fast and to work equivalently to RT-PCR methods. RT-LAMP has the potential to transform COVID-19 detection, bringing rapid and accurate testing to the PoC. RT-LAMP could be deployed in mobile community testing units, care homes and hospitals to detect disease early and prevent spread.","Österdahl, Marc F; Lee, Karla A; Lochlainn, Mary Ni; Wilson, Stuart; Douthwaite, Sam; Horsfall, Rachel; Sheedy, Alyce; Goldenberg, Simon D; Stanley, Christopher J; Spector, Tim D; Steves, Claire J",BMC Infect Dis,86,21

Being subjected to strict social confinement is a distressful psychological experience leading to reduced emotional well-being, but it is not known how it can affect the cognitive and empathic tendencies of different individuals. Cortisol, a key glucocorticoid in humans, is a strong modulator of brain function, behavior, and cognition, and the diurnal cortisol rhythm has been postulated to interact with environmental stressors to predict stress adaptation. The present study investigates in 45 young adults (21.09 years old, SD = 6.42) whether pre-pandemic diurnal cortisol indices, overall diurnal cortisol secretion (AUCg) and cortisol awakening response (CAR) can predict individuals' differential susceptibility to the impact of strict social confinement during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on working memory, empathy, and perceived stress. We observed that, following long-term home confinement, there was an increase in subjects' perceived stress and cognitive empathy scores, as well as an improvement in visuospatial working memory. Moreover, during confinement, resilient coping moderated the relationship between perceived stress scores and pre-pandemic AUCg and CAR. In addition, in mediation models, we observed a direct effect of AUCg and an indirect effect of both CAR and AUCg, on change in perceived self-efficacy. These effects were parallelly mediated by the increase in working memory span and cognitive empathy. In summary, our findings reveal the role of the diurnal pattern of cortisol in predicting the emotional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting a potential biomarker for the identification of at-risk groups following public health crises.","Baliyan, Shishir; Cimadevilla, José Manuel; de Vidania, Silvia; Pulopulos, Matías M; Sandi, Carmen; Venero, César",,86,1

As a result, discharge planning, patient access to local community-based treatment, and safety-net programming were affected. Given structural and intersectional risk vulnerabilities of people with substance use disorders (SUDs), the OHSU members felt that COVID-19 would disproportionately impact chronically marginalized members of our community. These inequities inspired the formation of the Oregon substance use disorder resources collaborative (ORSUD) led by four medical students. ORSUD's mission is to support the efforts of local safety-net organizations that and front-line providers who serve chronically marginalized community members in the midst of the global pandemic. We operationalized our mission through: 1) collecting and disseminating operational and capacity changes in local addiction and harm reduction services to the broader treatment community, and 2) identifying and addressing immediate resource needs for local safety-net programs. Our program uses a real-time public-facing document to collate local programmatic updates and general community resources.

Rapid spread of COVID-19 has forced clinicians to care for patients with a highly contagious disease without evidence-based guidelines. Using a virtual modified nominal group technique, the Pediatric Difficult Intubation Collaborative (PeDI-C), which currently includes 35 hospitals from 6 countries, generated consensus guidelines on airway management in pediatric anesthesia based on expert opinion and early data about the disease. PeDI-C identified overarching goals during care, including minimizing aerosolized respiratory secretions, minimizing the number of clinicians in contact with a patient, and recognizing that undiagnosed asymptomatic patients may shed the virus and infect health care workers. Recommendations include administering anxiolytic medications, intravenous anesthetic inductions, tracheal intubation using video laryngoscopes and cuffed tracheal tubes, use of in-line suction catheters, and modifying workflow to recover patients from anesthesia in the operating room. Importantly, PeDI-C recommends that anesthesiologists consider using appropriate personal protective equipment when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures in asymptomatic children, in addition to known or suspected children with COVID-19. Airway procedures should be done in negative pressure rooms when available. Adequate time should be allowed for operating room cleaning and air filtration between surgical cases. Research using rigorous study designs is urgently needed to inform safe practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Until further information is available, PeDI-C advises that clinicians consider these guidelines to enhance the safety of health care workers during airway management when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures. These guidelines have been endorsed by the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia and the Canadian Pediatric Anesthesia Society.","Matava, Clyde T; Kovatsis, Pete G; Lee, Jennifer K; Castro, Pilar; Denning, Simon; Yu, Julie; Park, Raymond; Lockman, Justin L; Von Ungern-Sternberg, Britta; Sabato, Stefano; Lee, Lisa K; Ayad, Ihab; Mireles, Sam; Lardner, David; Whyte, Simon; Szolnoki, Judit; Jagannathan, Narasimhan; Thompson, Nicole; Stein, Mary Lyn; Dalesio, Nicholas; Greenberg, Robert; McCloskey, John; Peyton, James; Evans, Faye; Haydar, Bishr; Reynolds, Paul; Chiao, Franklin; Taicher, Brad; Templeton, Thomas; Bhalla, Tarun; Raman, Vidya T; Garcia-Marcinkiewicz, Annery; Gálvez, Jorge; Tan, Jonathan; Rehman, Mohamed; Crockett, Christy; Olomu, Patrick; Szmuk, Peter; Glover, Chris; Matuszczak, Maria; Galvez, Ignacio; Hunyady, Agnes; Polaner, David; Gooden, Cheryl; Hsu, Grace; Gumaney, Harshad; Pérez-Pradilla, Caroline; Kiss, Edgar E; Theroux, Mary C; Lau, Jennifer",Anesth Analg,86,12

The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of olfactory disorder objectively in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study included 31 healthy controls and 59 COVID-19 patients who were diagnosed and treated in the COVID departments in a tertiary hospital. The patients with corona virus infection were screened by a questionnaire and were classified into 2 groups as either group 2 (patients without self-reported smell loss) or group 3 (patients with self-reported smell loss). Age and gender matched healthy controls who do not have chronic nasal condition or nasal surgery history comprised the control group (group 1). All of the patients and subjects in the control group were tested by the Sniffin' Sticks test. All of the answers and scores were recorded, and the comparisons were made. RESULTS: The rate of self-reported smell and taste loss in all COVID-19 patients in this study was 52.5% and 42%, respectively. There was a significant difference in threshold, discrimination, identification, and Threshold, Discrimination, Identification (TDI) scores between groups 1 and 2. When the comparisons between group 1 and 3 were made, again threshold, discrimination, identification, and TDI scores were significantly different. The comparison between groups 2 and 3 demonstrated a significant difference in discrimination, identification, and TDI scores, but threshold score was not different statistically. With questionnaire, the rate of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients was 52.5%, but with objective test, the rate was calculated as 83%. CONCLUSION: Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are common in COVID-19 patients. According to findings with the objective test method in this study, smell disorder in COVID-19 patients was much higher than those detected by questionnaires.","Gözen, E Deniz; Aliyeva, Chinara; Tevetoglu, Firat; Karaali, Ridvan; Balkan, Ilker Inanç; Yener, H Murat; Özdogan, H Ahmet",Ear Nose Throat J,86,5

It is of critical importance to go beyond offering resources, connecting families directly to the resources and documenting the changes that happen Therefore, the authors implemented an innovative way to do so by incorporating community health and education workers (CHEWs) who can serve as liaisons between families, resources, and schools, providing health and educational outreach and advocacy Informed by Maslow's hierarchy of need, they believe that what happens outside of the classroom directly impacts a child in the classroom;thus, helping parents and students to connect to resources more effectively ultimately prepares the child for success in the classroom The article begins by describing who the community health and education workers (CHEWs) are It goes on to describe how the authors worked with a low-income minority school district in Southern California with over 53,000 students placing CHEWs at schools in hopes of ultimately impacting education by reducing chronic absenteeism, increasing parental engagement, and increasing use of school district resources","Malika, Nipher Granillo Cristie Belliard Juan Carlos",Childhood Education,86,26

The number of infected people has been increasing exponentially since, and the mortality rate has also been concomitantly increasing. At present, no study has summarized the mortality risk of COVID-19 in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to conduct a literature review and meta-analysis to understand the frequency of mortality among CKD patients infected with COVID-19. A comprehensive systematic search was conducted on the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases to find articles published until May 15, 2020. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. After careful screening based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 3,867,367 patients from 12 studies were included. The mortality rate was significantly higher among CKD patients with COVID-19 infection than among CKD patients without COVID-19 infection, as indicated by a pooled OR of 5.81 (95% CI 3.78-8.94, P < 0.00001, I2 = 30%). The patients were then stratified into &#8805; 70 and < 70 years, and subgroup analysis revealed that among CKD patients with COVID-19 infection, the mortality rate was higher in the < 70 years group (OR 8.69, 95% CI 7.56-9.97, P < 0.0001) than in the &#8805; 70 years group (OR 2.44, 95% CI 0.75-6.63, P = 0.15). Thus, COVID-19 patients with CKD have a high mortality risk and require a comprehensive multidisciplinary management strategy.","Cai, Ruyi; Zhang, Jinshi; Zhu, Yifan; Liu, Lin; Liu, Yueming; He, Qiang",Int. urol. nephrol,86,29

This study was conducted to assess the acceptance of a 50 or 95% effective COVID-19 vaccine, when it becomes available in southeast Asia, among the general population in Indonesia. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between March 25 and April 6, 2020. Participants were asked if they would accept a free vaccine which was 95 or 50% effective. Using a logistic regression model, we assessed the associations between sociodemographic characteristics, exposure to COVID-19 information, or perceived risk of infection with acceptance of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. Results: Among 1,359 respondents, 93.3% of respondents (1,268/1,359) would like to be vaccinated for a 95% effective vaccine, but this acceptance decreased to 67.0% (911/1,359) for a vaccine with 50% effectiveness. For a 95% effective vaccine, being a healthcare worker and having a higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection were associated with higher acceptance, adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.01; 95%CI: 1.01, 4.00 and aOR: 2.21; 95%CI: 1.07, 4.59, respectively; compared to civil servants, being retired was associated with less acceptance (aOR: 0.15; 95%CI: 0.04, 0.63). For a 50% effective vaccine, being a healthcare worker was also associated with greater acceptance, aOR: 1.57; 95%CI: 1.12, 2.20. Conclusion: Acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine was highly influenced by the baseline effectiveness of the vaccine. Preparing the general population to accept a vaccine with relatively low effectiveness may be difficult.","Harapan, Harapan; Wagner, Abram L.; Yufika, Amanda; Winardi, Wira; Anwar, Samsul; Gan, Alex Kurniawan; Setiawan, Abdul Malik; Rajamoorthy, Yogambigai; Sofyan, Hizir; Mudatsir, Mudatsir",Front.

METHODS: All patients referred to emergency rooms anywhere in Iran between 12 and 25 April 2020 and who were sufficiently ill to require hospital admission with COVID-19, confirmed by a positive COVID-19 test, were studied. Data on the presenting manifestations were collected. RESULTS: Of 5872 people, who were admitted to hospitals in Iran with COVID-19 during the study period, 45 came to the emergency room with seizures. This makes seizure as the presenting manifestation of COVID-19 in 0.8 % of all patients with a severe illness. 93 % of the patients were 15 years of age and older. Four of the individuals presenting with seizures (9%) had a past history of epilepsy. Fifteen of these individuals (33 %) had other chronic medical conditions (e.g., cancer, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, etc.). CONCLUSION: This case series provides evidence that seizures are among the presenting manifestations of COVID-19 in 0.8 % of the patients who are admitted to hospital due to a severe illness.","Keshavarzi, Abdolkhalegh; Janbabaei, Ghasem; Kheyrati, Leila; Ghavamabad, Leila Hoseini; Asadi-Pooya, Ali A",Seizure,86,27

The latter is relevant no matter the actual state of the rock glacier (intact, containing ice versus relict, no more ice present). A nation-wide comparison of the water equivalent of glacier ice within the Austrian Alps is conducted to evaluate the role of rock glaciers in the hydrological cycle at its current state and potentially in the future. Estimates of ice volumes and their uncertainties, especially related to thickness estimates of permafrost-ice bodies, are discussed in the light of available data and need to be seen as order-of-magnitude estimates. With intact rock glaciers covering almost 123 km2 and an assumed ice content of 40% within the permafrost body, ice volumes are estimated to be 0.93 Gigatons. This corresponds to 8.3% of the ice volume estimated for the most recent glacier inventory of the Austrian Alps. Thus, with the currently available data, a water equivalent ratio of ~1: 12 for rock glacier ice versus glacier ice is estimated. In addition to the solid water storage, the dynamic storage potential within rock glaciers in liquid form needs to be considered. While this volume is relatively small compared to the ice volume in glaciers and rock glaciers (ratio of ~1: 20), the time-scales of hydrological relevance (when they become runoff due to ice melt) are very different. This dynamic liquid water storage is replenishable and therefore available over shorter time scales (seasonal drainage pattern), and moreover relatively stable and may potentially even slightly increase as pore space becomes available due to increased melting of permafrost ice. In the light of climate warming and projected glacier recession, the relative hydrological importance of rock glaciers as water stores (in solid as well as in liquid form) in the European Alps is expected to increase and their storage-discharge patterns need to be accounted for in water management considerations.","Wagner, Thomas; Kainz, Simon; Helfricht, Kay; Fischer, Andrea; Avian, Michael; Krainer, Karl; Winkler, Gerfried",Sci Total Environ,86,22

Identification of individual-level susceptibility factors may help people in identifying and managing their emotional, psychological, and social well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study is focused on learning a ranked list of factors that could indicate a predisposition to a mental disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this study, we have used a survey of 17,764 adults in the United States from different age groups, genders, and socioeconomic statuses. Through initial statistical analysis and Bayesian network inference, we have identified key factors affecting mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Integrating Bayesian networks with classical machine learning approaches led to effective modeling of the level of mental health prevalence. RESULTS: Overall, females were more stressed than males, and people in the age group 18-29 years were more vulnerable to anxiety than other age groups. Using the Bayesian network model, we found that people with a chronic mental illness were more prone to mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The new realities of working from home; homeschooling; and lack of communication with family, friends, and neighbors induces mental pressure. Financial assistance from social security helps in reducing mental stress during the COVID-19-generated economic crises. Finally, using supervised machine learning models, we predicted the most mentally vulnerable people with ~80% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors such as social isolation, digital communication, and working and schooling from home were identified as factors of mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regular in-person communication with friends and family, a healthy social life, and social security were key factors, and taking care of people with a history of mental disease appears to be even more important during this time.","Jha, Indra Prakash; Awasthi, Raghav; Kumar, Ajit; Kumar, Vibhor; Sethi, Tavpritesh",JMIR Ment Health,86,33

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a marked reduction in in-patient attendance. We are highlighting the impact of lockdown in neurotrauma cases in our institution compared to the prelockdown period. Methods We have done the retrospective review of the patients admitted due to TBI in prelockdown (January 14-March 21, 2020) and lockdown period (March 25-May 31, 2020) for the same duration of the 68 days at our tertiary institution. We have included demographic characteristics (age, sex), mode of injury, the severity of TBI, radiological diagnosis (computed tomography scan), and treatment obtained in our study. We compared the data for percentage (%) reduction of TBI cases and factors responsible for it during the lockdown period. Result A total of 166 patients were included in both groups. TBI's most common mechanism was road traffic accident, but we observed an increase in self-fall (16.9% vs. 38.1%) and assault (11.2% vs. 19%) during the lockdown period. We have noted that moderate TBI increased during the lockdown period by 17%. Overall, there is a reduction of 67% in TBI cases during the lockdown period. Conclusion The COVID pandemic has limited road traffic activity, and strict implementation of lockdown has restricted the infection and has reduced the neurotrauma emergencies. Simultaneously, moderate TBI cases have increased because of the lack of transportation facility and delay in the management of mild TBI cases.","Nayak, N.; Singh, P. R.; Sharma, R. K.; Gupta, S.

We cross-validated manual and automated high-throughput testing for SARS-CoV-2-RNA, evaluated SARS-CoV-2 loads in nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS), lower respiratory fluids, and plasma, and analyzed detection rates after lockdown and relaxation measures. METHODS: Basel-S-gene, Roche-E-gene, and Roche-cobas®6800-Target1 and Target2 were prospectively validated in 1344 NOPS submitted during the first pandemic peak (Week 13). Follow-up cohort (FUP) 1, 2, and 3 comprised 10,999, 10,147, and 19,389 NOPS submitted during a 10-week period until Weeks 23, 33, and 43, respectively. RESULTS: Concordant results were obtained in 1308 cases (97%), including 97 (9%) SARS-CoV-2-positives showing high quantitative correlations (Spearman's r > .95; p < .001) for all assays and high precision by Bland-Altman analysis. Discordant samples (N = 36, 3%) had significantly lower SARS-CoV-2 loads (p < .001). Following lockdown, detection rates declined to <1% in FUP-1, reducing single-test positive predictive values from 99.3% to 85.1%. Following relaxation, rates flared up to 4% and 12% in FUP-2 and -3, but infected patients were younger than during lockdown (34 vs. 52 years, p < .001). In 261 patients providing 936 NOPS, SARS-CoV-2 loads declined by three orders of magnitude within 10 days postdiagnosis (p < .001). SARS-CoV-2 loads in NOPS correlated with those in time-matched lower respiratory fluids or in plasma but remained detectable in some cases with negative follow-up NOPS, respectively. CONCLUSION: Manual and automated assays significantly correlated qualitatively and quantitatively. Following a successful lockdown, declining positive predictive values require independent dual-target confirmation for reliable assessment. Confirmatory and quantitative follow-up testing should be obtained within <5 days and consider lower respiratory fluids in symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative NOPS.","Leuzinger, Karoline; Gosert, Rainer; Søgaard, Kirstine K; Naegele, Klaudia; Bielicki, Julia; Roloff, Tim; Bingisser, Roland; Nickel, Christian H; Khanna, Nina; Sutter, Sarah Tschudin; Widmer, Andreas F; Rentsch, Katharina; Pargger, Hans; Siegemund, Martin; Stolz, Daiana; Tamm, Michael; Bassetti, Stefano; Osthoff, Michael; Battegay, Manuel; Egli, Adrian; Hirsch, Hans H",J. med. virol,86,22

To this aim, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein represents a crucial target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. Since virus binding to ACE-2 alone could not be sufficient to justify such severe infection, in order to facilitate medical countermeasure development and to search for new targets, two further regions of S protein have been taken into consideration here. One is represented by the recently identified ganglioside binding site, exactly localized in our study in the galectin-like domain, and the other one by the putative integrin binding sites contained in the RBD. We propose that a cooperating therapy using inhibitors against multiple targets altogether i.e., ACE2, integrins and sugars could be definitely more effective.","Pirone, Luciano; Del Gatto, Annarita; Di Gaetano, Sonia; Saviano, Michele; Capasso, Domenica; Zaccaro, Laura; Pedone, Emilia",Front.

After PCR amplification, concentrations are determined based on the proportion of nonfluorescent partitions through the Poisson distribution. Some of the main features of ddPCR include high sensitivity and specificity, absolute quantification without a standard curve, high reproducibility, good tolerance to PCR inhibitor, and high efficacy compared to conventional molecular methods. These advantages make ddPCR a valuable addition to the virologist's toolbox.

How they do so in COVID-19 may be revealed by analyzing the epigenetic chromatin accessibility of cis- and trans-regulatory elements and creating transcriptomic immune profiles. We performed single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC) and single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing (seq) on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of severely ill/critical patients (SCPs) infected with COVID-19, moderate patients (MPs), and healthy volunteer controls (HCs). About 76,570 and 107,862 single cells were used, respectively, for analyzing the characteristics of chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic immune profiles by the application of scATAC-seq (nine cases) and scRNA-seq (15 cases). The scATAC-seq detected 28,535 different peaks in the three groups; among these peaks, 41.6 and 10.7% were located in the promoter and enhancer regions, respectively. Compared to HCs, among the peak-located genes in the total T cells and its subsets, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, from SCPs and MPs were enriched with inflammatory pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway. The motifs of TBX21 were less accessible in the CD4+ T cells of SCPs compared with those in MPs. Furthermore, the scRNA-seq showed that the proportion of T cells, especially the CD4+ T cells, was decreased in SCPs and MPs compared with those in HCs. Transcriptomic results revealed that histone-related genes, and inflammatory genes, such as NFKBIA, S100A9, and PIK3R1, were highly expressed in the total T cells, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, both in the cases of SCPs and MPs. In the CD4+ T cells, decreased T helper-1 (Th1) cells were observed in SCPs and MPs. In the CD8+T cells, activation markers, such as CD69 and HLA class II genes (HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DRB5), were significantly upregulated in SCPs. An integrated analysis of the data from scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq showed some consistency between the approaches. Cumulatively, we have generated a landscape of chromatin epigenetic status and transcriptomic immune profiles of T cells in patients with COVID-19. This has provided a deeper dissection of the characteristics of the T cells involved at a higher resolution than from previously obtained data merely by the scRNA-seq analysis. Our data led us to suggest that the T-cell inflammatory states accompanied with defective functions in the CD4+ T cells of SCPs may be the key factors for determining the pathogenesis of and recovery from COVID-19.","Li, Shun; Wu, Bin; Ling, Yun; Guo, Mingquan; Qin, Boyin; Ren, Xiaonan; Wang, Chao; Yang, Hua; Chen, Lixiang; Liao, Yixin; Liu, Yang; Peng, Xiuhua; Xu, Chunhua; Wang, Zhenyan; Shen, Yinzhong; Chen, Jun; Liu, Li; Niu, Bowen; Zhu, Mengmin; Liu, Lingling; Li, Feng; Zhu, Tongyu; Zhu, Zhaoqin; Zhou, Xiaohui; Lu, Hongzhou",Front Immunol,86,26

The emergence of drug resistance to first line drugs, artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), indicates an urgent need for continuous molecular surveillance of drug resistance especially in high burden countries where drug interventions are heavily relied on. This study describes mutations in Plasmodium falciparum genes associated with drug resistance in malaria; Pfk13, Pfmdr1, PfATPase6 and Pfcrt in isolates obtained from 83 symptomatic malaria patients collected in August 2014, aged 1-61 years old from South-west Nigeria. RESULTS: Two Pfmdr1, N86 and Y184 variants were present at a prevalence of 56% and 13.25% of isolates respectively. There was one synonymous (S679S) and two non-synonymous (M699V, S769M) mutations in the PATPase6 gene, while Pfcrt genotype (CVIET), had a prevalence of 45%. The Pfk13 C580Y mutant allele was suspected by allelic discrimination in two samples with mixed genotypes although this could not be validated with independent isolation or additional methods. Our findings call for robust molecular surveillance of antimalarial drug resistance markers in west Africa especially with increased use of antimalarial drugs as prophylaxis for Covid-19.","Tola, Monday; Ajibola, Olumide; Idowu, Emmanuel Taiwo; Omidiji, Olusesan; Awolola, Samson Taiwo; Amambua-Ngwa, Alfred",BMC Res Notes,86,6

Patients with confirmed COVID-19 (n = 430) hospitalized between March 18 and April 21, 2020 were divided in derivation (n = 310) and validation (n = 120) cohorts. Two groups became evident: (1) good prognosis group (G-group) with patients hospitalized at the conventional COVID-19 ward and (2) Worsening disease group (W-group) with patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from the emergency departments. The study end point was disease worsening (acute respiratory failure, shock, myocardial dysfunction, bacterial or viral coinfections, and acute kidney injury) requiring ICU admission. All patients were routinely evaluated for full blood count, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, D-dimers, antithrombin (AT), and protein C activity. Data from the first hospitalization day at the conventional ward or the ICU were analyzed. Cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities were routinely registered. Obesity, hypertension, diabetes and male gender, increased fibrinogen and D-dimers, thrombocytopenia, AT deficiency, lymphopenia, and an International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) score for compensated disseminated intravascular coagulation score (cDIC-ISTH) &#8805;5 were significant risk factors for worsening disease.

The score has a very good discriminating capacity to stratify patients at high and low risk for worsening disease, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.77, a sensitivity of 81%, and a specificity of 60%. Application of the COMPASS-COVID-19 score at the validation cohort showed 96% sensitivity. The COMPASS-COVID-19 score is an accurate clinical decision-making tool for an easy identification of COVID-19 patients being at high risk for disease worsening.","Gerotziafas, Grigoris T; Sergentanis, Theodoros N; Voiriot, Guillaume; Lassel, Ludovic; Papageorgiou, Chryssa; Elabbadi, Alexandre; Turpin, Matthieu; Vandreden, Patrick; Papageorgiou, Loula; Psaltopoulou, Theodora; Terpos, Evangelos; Dimopoulos, Meletios-Athanasios; Parrot, Antoine; Cadranel, Jacques; Pialoux, Gilles; Fartoukh, Muriel; Elalamy, Ismail",Thromb. haemost,86,16

This is especially true in the area of cultural dynamics and their effects on pathogen behaviours, although there is evidence to suggest that this relationship is central to shaping our interactions with infectious disease agents on a variety of levels. This paper makes a case for a biocultural approach to pandemics such as COVID-19. It then uses this biocultural framework to examine the anthropogenic dynamics that influenced and continue to shape the COVID-19 pandemic, both during its initial phase and during critical intersections of the pandemic. Through this understanding of biocultural interactions between people, animals and pathogens, a broader societal and political dimension is drawn as a function of population level and international cultures, to reflect on the culturally mediated differential burden of the pandemic. Ultimately, it is argued that a biocultural perspective on infectious disease pandemics will allow for critical reflection on how culture shapes our behaviours at all levels, and how the effects of these behaviours are ultimately foundational to pathogen ecology and evolution.","Friedler, Anna",Glob Public Health,86,29

Generalized linear models (GLM), a typical choice for ecological modeling, have well-established limitations. These limitations include apriori assumptions, inability to handle multicollinearity, and considering differential effects as the fixed effect. We propose an Ensemble-based Dynamic Emission Model (EDEM) to address these limitations. EDEM is developed at the intersection of network science and ensemble learning, i.e., a specialized approach of machine learning. Generalized Additive Model (GAM), i.e., a variant of GLM, and EDEM are tested in Los Angeles and Ventura counties of California, which is one of the biggest SARS-CoV-2 clusters in the US. GAM depicts that a 1 µg/m3, 1 µg/m3, and 1 ppm increase (lag 0-7) in PM 2.5, PM 10, and O3 is associated with 4.51 % (CI: -7.01 to -2.00) decrease, 1.62 % (CI: -2.23 to -1.022) decrease, and 4.66 % (CI: 0.85 to 8.47) increase in daily SARS-CoV-2 cases, respectively. Subsequent increment in lag resulted in the negative association between pollutants and SARS-CoV-2 cases. EDEM results in an R2 score of 90.96% and 79.16% on training and testing datasets, respectively. EDEM confirmed the negative association between particulates and SARS-CoV-2 cases; whereas, the O3 depicts a positive association; however, the positive association observed through GAM is not statistically significant. In addition, the county-level analysis of pollutant concentration interactions suggests that increased emissions from other counties positively affect SARS-CoV-2 cases in adjoining counties as well.

Some of the flavonoids used in the in vivo studies also protected the tested mice prophylactically from lethal doses of virus, and effectively prevented viral infection. The glycosides of some of the flavonoids increased the solubility of some flavonoids, and therefore showed increased antiviral activity as compared to the non-glycoside form of that flavonoid. These phytochemicals are active against different disease-causing viruses, and inhibited the viruses by targeting the viral infections at multiple stages.

Dexamethasone is an immunosuppressive treatment potentially increasing the risk of secondary hospital acquired infections in critically ill patients. We conducted an observational retrospective study in three French intensive care units (ICUs) comparing the first and second waves of pandemic to investigate the role of dexamethasone in the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and blood stream infections (BSI). Patients admitted from March to November 2020 with a documented COVID-19 and requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) for &#8805; 48 h were included. The main study outcomes were the incidence of VAP and BSI according to the use of dexamethasone. Secondary outcomes were the ventilator-free days (VFD) at day-28 and day-60, ICU and hospital length of stay and mortality. RESULTS: Among the 151 patients included, 84 received dexamethasone, all but one during the second wave. VAP occurred in 63% of patients treated with dexamethasone (DEXA+) and 57% in those not receiving dexamethasone (DEXA-) (p = 0.43). The cumulative incidence of VAP, considering death, duration of MV and late immunosuppression as competing factors was not different between groups (p = 0.59). A multivariate analysis did not identify dexamethasone as an independent risk factor for VAP occurrence. The occurrence of BSI was not different between groups (29 vs. 30%; p = 0.86). DEXA+ patients had more VFD at day-28 (9 (0-21) vs. 0 (0-11) days; p = 0.009) and a reduced ICU length of stay (20 (11-44) vs. 32 (17-46) days; p = 0.01). Mortality did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of COVID-19 patients requiring invasive MV, dexamethasone was not associated with an increased incidence of VAP or BSI.

Controversy exists regarding the role of early intubation versus use of non-invasive respiratory support measures to avoid intubation. This review summarizes available evidence and provides a clinical decision algorithm with risk mitigation techniques to guide clinicians in care of the hypoxemic, non-intubated, patient during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although aerosolization of droplets may occur with aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMP), including high flow nasal oxygen and non-invasive ventilation, the risk of using these AGMP is outweighed by the benefit in carefully selected patients, particularly if care is taken to mitigate risk of viral transmission. Non-invasive support measures should not be denied for conditions where previously proven effective and may be used even while there is suspicion of COVID-19 infection. Patients with de novo acute respiratory illness with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 may also benefit. These techniques may improve oxygenation sufficiently to allow some patients to avoid intubation; however, patients must be carefully monitored for signs of increased work of breathing. Patients showing signs of clinical deterioration or high work of breathing not alleviated by non-invasive support should proceed promptly to intubation and invasive lung protective ventilation strategy. With adherence to these principles, risk of viral spread can be minimized.","Leasa, David; Cameron, Paul; Honarmand, Kimia; Mele, Tina; Bosma, Karen J",Crit Care,86,20

The Papain-like protease (PLpro), which is essential for viral replication, shares a similar active site structural architecture to other cysteine proteases. Here, we have used representatives of the Ovarian Tumor Domain deubiquitinase family OTUB1 and OTUB2 along with the PLpro of SARS-CoV-2 to validate and rationalize the binding of inhibitors from previous SARS-CoV candidate compounds. By forming a new chemical bond with the cysteine residue of the catalytic triad, covalent inhibitors irreversibly suppress the protein's activity. Modeling covalent inhibitor binding requires detailed knowledge about the compounds' reactivities and binding. Molecular Dynamics refinement simulations of top poses reveal detailed ligand-protein interactions and show their stability over time. The recently discovered selective OTUB2 covalent inhibitors were used to establish and validate the computational protocol. Structural parameters and ligand dynamics are in excellent agreement with the ligand-bound OTUB2 crystal structures. For SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, recent covalent peptidomimetic inhibitors were simulated and reveal that the ligand-protein interaction is very dynamic. The covalent and non-covalent docking plus subsequent MD refinement of known SARS-CoV inhibitors into DUBs and the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro point out a possible approach to target the PLpro cysteine protease from SARS-CoV-2. The results show that such an approach gives insight into ligand-protein interactions, their dynamic character, and indicates a path for selective ligand design.","Sivakumar, Dakshinamurthy; Stein, Matthias",Biomolecules,86,24

S over the last 10 years. Although 5-year survival rates for early-stage EC are around 80%, certain subtypes of EC that lose nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) expression are associated with poor survival rates. For example, estrogen receptor (ER)-negative EC typically harbors a worse prognosis compared to ER-positive EC. The molecular basis for the loss of NHR expression in endometrial tumors and its contribution to poor survival is largely unknown. Furthermore, there are no tools to systematically identify tumors that lose NHR mRNA expression relative to normal tissue. The development of such an approach could identify sets of NHR-based biomarkers for classifying patients into subgroups with poor survival outcomes. METHODS: Here, a new computational method, termed receptLoss, was developed for identifying NHR expression loss in endometrial cancer relative to adjacent normal tissue. When applied to gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), receptLoss identified 6 NHRs that were highly expressed in normal tissue and exhibited expression loss in a subset of endometrial tumors. RESULTS: Three of the six identified NHRs - estrogen, progesterone, and androgen receptors - that are known to lose expression in ECs were correctly identified by receptLoss. Additionally, a novel association was found between thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRB) expression loss, increased expression of miRNA-146a, and increased rates of 5-year survival in the EC TCGA patient cohort. THRB expression loss occurs independently of estrogen and progesterone expression loss, suggesting the discovery of a distinct, clinically-relevant molecular subgroup. CONCLUSION: ReceptLoss is a novel, open-source software tool to systematically identify NHR expression loss in cancer. The application of receptLoss to endometrial cancer gene expression data identified THRB, a previously undescribed biomarker of survival in endometrial cancer. Applying receptLoss to expression data from additional cancer types could lead to the development of biomarkers of disease progression for patients with any other tumor type. ReceptLoss can be applied to expression data from additional cancer types with the goal of identifying biomarkers of differential survival.","Piqué, Daniel G; Greally, John M; Mar, Jessica C",BMC Cancer,86,29

In mice, Cas13a degraded influenza RNA in lung tissue efficiently when delivered after infection, whereas in hamsters, Cas13a delivery reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication and reduced symptoms. Our findings suggest that Cas13a-mediated targeting of pathogenic viruses can mitigate respiratory infections.","Blanchard, Emmeline L; Vanover, Daryll; Bawage, Swapnil Subhash; Tiwari, Pooja Munnilal; Rotolo, Laura; Beyersdorf, Jared; Peck, Hannah E; Bruno, Nicholas C; Hincapie, Robert; Michel, Frank; Murray, Jackelyn; Sadhwani, Heena; Vanderheyden, Bob; Finn, M G; Brinton, Margo A; Lafontaine, Eric R; Hogan, Robert J; Zurla, Chiara; Santangelo, Philip J",Nat. biotechnol,86,16

AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the COVID-19 outbreak on hospital admissions and outcomes in ACS patients in a single high-volume centre in southeastern Europe. METHODS: This retrospective observational study aimed to investigate the number of hospital admissions for ACS, clinical findings at admission, length of hospitalisation, major complications and in-hospital mortality during the COVID-19 outbreak and to compare the data with the same parameters during an equivalent time frame in 2019. For the ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) subgroup of patients, changes in ischaemic times were analysed as well. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction of 44.3% in the number of patients admitted for ACS during the COVID-19 outbreak when compared with the same period in 2019 (151 vs 271; 95% confidence interval 38.4-50.2, pâ¯<â¯0.01) with a higher mortality rate (13.2% vs 7.2%, pâ¯= 0.03). In 2020, patients with non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction presented more often with acute heart failure (3.3% vs 0.7%, pâ¯= 0.04). During the COVID-19 outbreak, we observed increases in the total ischaemic time (303â¯± 163.4 vs 200.8â¯± 156.8â¯min, pâ¯<â¯0.05) and door-to-balloon time (69.2â¯± 58.4 vs 50.5â¯± 31.3â¯min, pâ¯<â¯0.01) in STEMI patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings should increase the awareness of morbidity and mortality related to missed or delayed treatment of ACS among the public and the healthcare services.","Petrovic, M; Milovancev, A; Kovacevic, M; Miljkovic, T; Ilic, A; Stojsic-Milosavljevic, A; Golubovic, M",Neth. heart j,86,16

In this investigation, we aimed to evaluate ADAMTS13 activity, von Willebrand factor level (VWF:Ag), and the corresponding ADAMTS13 activity/VWF:Ag ratio, in patients with COVID-19 and for associations with disease progression and acute kidney injury (AKI). METHODS: Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with COVID-19 were enrolled in this prospective, observational study. ADAMTS13 activity and VWF:Ag were measured at index ED visit. The primary endpoint was severe AKI defined by KDIGO stage 2 + 3 criteria, while the secondary endpoint was peak 30-day COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: A total of 52 adult COVID-19 patients were enrolled. Overall, we observed that 23.1% of the cohort had a relative deficiency in ADAMTS13 activity, while 80.8% had elevated VWF:Ag. The ADAMTS13 activity/VWF:Ag ratio was significantly lower in patients with severe AKI (P = .002) and those who developed the severe form of COVID-19 (P = .020). The ADAMTS13 activity/VWF:Ag ratio was negatively correlated with age (P < .001) and LDH (P < .001), while positively correlated with hemoglobin (P = .041). After controlling for confounders, a one-unit increase in ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio was associated with 20% decreased odds of severe AKI. CONCLUSION: A low ADAMTS13 activity:VWF:Ag ratio at ED presentation is associated with progression to severe COVID-19 disease and severe AKI, with a pattern suggestive of a secondary microangiopathy. Further interventional studies should be conducted to assess the restoration of ADAMTS13:VWF:Ag ratio in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Henry, Brandon Michael; Benoit, Stefanie W; de Oliveira, Maria Helena Santos; Lippi, Giuseppe; Favaloro, Emmanuel J; Benoit, Justin L",Int. j. lab. hematol,86,21

METHODS: Three healthcare workers received 30 µg BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Pfizer Vaccine, followed by a second identical dose, 21 days afterwards. Venous blood was drawn at baseline and at serial intervals, up to 63 days afterwards, for assessing total immunoglobulins (Ig) anti-RBD (receptor binding domain), anti-S1/S2 and anti-RBD IgG, anti-RBD and anti-N/S1 IgM, and anti-S1 IgA. RESULTS: All subjects were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at baseline. Total Ig anti-RBD, anti-S1/S2 and anti-RBD IgG levels increased between 91 and 368 folds until 21 days after the first vaccine dose, then reached a plateau. The levels raised further after the second dose (by â¼30-, â¼8- and â¼8-fold, respectively), peaking at day 35, but then slightly declining and stabilizing â¼50 days after the first vaccine dose. Anti-S1 IgA levels increased between 7 and 11 days after the first dose, slightly declined before the second dose, after which levels augmented by â¼24-fold from baseline. The anti-RBD and anti-N/S1 IgM kinetics were similar to that of anti-S1 IgA, though displaying substantially weaker increases and modest peaks, only 4- to 7-fold higher than baseline. Highly significant inter-correlation was noted between total Ig anti-RBD, anti-S1/S2 and anti-RBD IgG (all r=0.99), whilst other anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies displayed lower, though still significant, correlations. Serum spike protein concentration was undetectable at all-time points. CONCLUSIONS: BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination generates a robust humoral immune response, especially involving anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgG and IgA, magnified by the second vaccine dose.","Danese, Elisa; Montagnana, Martina; Salvagno, Gian Luca; Peserico, Denise; Pighi, Laura; De Nitto, Simone; Henry, Brandon M; Porru, Stefano; Lippi, Giuseppe",Clin. chem. lab. med,86,20

METHODS: This is a prospective observational study involving pediatric patients with epilepsy with neurocognitive and emotional comorbidities. Included patients were admitted to our hospital between August 2019 and February 2020 for epilepsy and neuropsychiatric assessment, and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) questionnaires were filled in by parents. Those patients and their families accepted to participate in a phone follow-up visit in April-May 2020 and to refill CBCL and Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF) questionnaires. Descriptive statistics for demographic and clinical data, CBCL questionnaire scores before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and PSI-SF scores have been computed. Moreover, results of a short phone survey on the psychological burden during COVID lockdown have been reported. RESULTS: This study provides the parental-proxy report of emotional and behavioral profile changes of 23 pediatric patients with epilepsy and neurocognitive and emotional comorbidities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Concerns for therapy monitoring at the time of lockdown emerged in 43% of families, and 30% of patients showed worries for an altered contact with the referring medical team. Patients with neurocognitive comorbidities were more likely to exhibit behavioral problems, especially externalizing problems compared with patients with a diagnosis of anxiety/depression.

Data from four prevention trials that targeted high-risk young women with body image concerns (N = 1,952; Mage = 19.7, SD = 5.7) and collected annual diagnostic interview data over 3-year follow-up were combined to address these aims. Regarding behavioral symptoms, compensatory weight control behaviors typically emerged first for AN, BN, and PD, whereas binge eating typically emerged first for BED. Regarding cognitive symptoms, for AN, weight/shape overvaluation typically emerged first, whereas for BN, BED, and PD, overvaluation typically emerged simultaneously with feeling fat and fear of weight gain. Binge eating, compensatory behaviors, weight/shape overvaluation, fear of weight gain, and feeling fat predicted BN, BED, and PD onset, whereas weight/shape overvaluation, fear of weight gain, and lower than expected body mass index predicted AN onset. Predictive effects of prodromal symptoms were similar in magnitude to those of established risk factors: Collectively, prodromal symptoms and risk factors predicted onset of specific eating disorders with 67-83% accuracy. Results suggest that compensatory weight control behaviors and cognitive symptoms are likely to emerge before binge eating in the various eating disorders and that offering indicated prevention programs to youth with prodromal symptoms may be an effective way to prevent eating disorders.

Many inpatients with COVID-19 have shown clinical symptoms related to sepsis, which will aggravate the deterioration of patients' condition. We aim to diagnose Viral Sepsis Caused by SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing laboratory test data of patients with COVID-19 and establish an early predictive model for sepsis risk among patients with COVID-19. Methods: This study retrospectively investigated laboratory test data of 2,453 patients with COVID-19 from electronic health records. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) was employed to build four models with different feature subsets of a total of 69 collected indicators. Meanwhile, the explainable Shapley Additive ePlanation (SHAP) method was adopted to interpret predictive results and to analyze the feature importance of risk factors. Findings: The model for classifying COVID-19 viral sepsis with seven coagulation function indicators achieved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.9213 (95% CI, 89.94-94.31%), sensitivity 97.17% (95% CI, 94.97-98.46%), and specificity 82.05% (95% CI, 77.24-86.06%). The model for identifying COVID-19 coagulation disorders with eight features provided an average of 3.68 (±) 4.60 days in advance for early warning prediction with 0.9298 AUC (95% CI, 86.91-99.04%), 82.22% sensitivity (95% CI, 67.41-91.49%), and 84.00% specificity (95% CI, 63.08-94.75%). Interpretation: We found that an abnormality of the coagulation function was related to the occurrence of sepsis and the other routine laboratory test represented by inflammatory factors had a moderate predictive value on coagulopathy, which indicated that early warning of sepsis in COVID-19 patients could be achieved by our established model to improve the patient's prognosis and to reduce mortality.","Tang, Guoxing; Luo, Ying; Lu, Feng; Li, Wei; Liu, Xiongcheng; Nan, Yucen; Ren, Yufei; Liao, Xiaofei; Wu, Song; Jin, Hai; Zomaya, Albert Y; Sun, Ziyong",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,86,20

Potential therapeutic drugs, vaccine and stem cell replacement methods are emerging, so it is urgent to find specific therapeutic drugs and the best treatment regimens. After the publications on hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with anti- SARS-COV-2 activity in vitro, a small, non-randomized, open-label clinical trial showed that HCQ treatment was significantly associated with reduced viral load in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Meanwhile, a large prophylaxis study of HCQ sulfate for COVID-19 has been initiated in the United States. HCQ offered a promising efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19, but the optimal administration is still being explored. METHODS: We used the keyword ""hydroxychloroquine"" to conduct a literature search in PubMed to collect relevant literature on the mechanism of action of HCQ, its clinical efficacy and safety, pharmacokinetic characteristics, precautions for clinical use and drug interactions to extract and organize information. RESULTS: This paper reviews the mechanism, clinical efficacy and safety, pharmacokinetic characteristics, exposureresponse relationship and precautions and drug interactions of HCQ, and summarizes dosage recommendations for HCQ sulfate. CONCLUSION: It has been proved that HCQ, which has an established safety profile, is effective against SARS-CoV-2 with sufficient pre-clinical rationale and evidence. Data from high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed worldwide.","Cui, Cheng; Tu, Siqi; En, Valerie Sia Jie; Li, Xiaobei; Yao, Xueting; Li, Haiyan; Liu, Dongyang",Curr Drug Metab,86,24

METHODS: In this prospective, multicentre, observational cohort study we systematically evaluated neurological signs and diseases by detailed neurological examination and a predefined test battery assessing smelling disorders (16-item Sniffin-Sticks-test), cognitive deficits (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), QoL (36-item Short Form), and mental health (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5) three months after disease onset. RESULTS: Of 135 consecutive COVID-19 patients, 31 (23%) required ICU-care (severe), 72 (53%) were admitted to the regular ward (moderate), and 32 (24%) underwent outpatient-care (mild) during acute disease. At three-month follow-up, 20 patients (15%) presented with one or more neurological syndromes that were not evident before COVID-19. These included poly-neuro/myopathy (n=16, 12%), mild encephalopathy (n=2, 2%), parkinsonism (n=1, 1%), orthostatic hypotension (n=1, 1%), Guillain-Barré-Syndrome (n=1, 1%) and ischemic stroke (n=1, 1%). Objective testing revealed hyposmia/anosmia in 57/127 (45%) patients at three-month follow-up. Self-reported hyposmia/anosmia was lower (17%), however, improved compared to the acute disease (44%; P<0.001). In ICU patients, encephalopathy improved over time (from 29% during acute disease to 3% at follow-up, P=0.008). At follow-up, cognitive deficits were apparent in 23%, and QoL was impaired in 31%. Assessment of mental health revealed symptoms of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders in 11%, 25%, and 11%, respectively.

For wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), also obnoxious facilities, upgrading and expanding the capacity of existing WWTP, are more important than the construction of new plants, in some regions. This study analyzes and compares the social acceptance of different types of WWTP upgrades and capacity expansion projects. Contingent valuation method is used to elicit South Korean households' willingness to pay (WTP) for preventing the expansion of a WWTP. The aggregated WTP is interpreted from the perspective of social conflict costs. The results show that the annual mean WTP of South Korean households to prevent WWTP expansion ranges from KRW 32,058 (US $27.61) to KRW 45,793 (US $39.44) depending on spatial location, which implies that the social conflict costs for the WWTP expansion in South Korea are considerable. It is also found that an underground WWTP at current site is a best alternative to lower the social conflict costs; it is even better than relocation an existing WWTP to another area. Several related policy implications are provided based on the analysis results.","Huh, Sung-Yoon; Shin, Jungwoo; Ryu, Jaena",,86,24

Despite the knowledge of previous diseases caused by viruses of the same family, such as MERS and SARS-CoV, management and treatment of patients with COVID-19 is a challenge. One of the best strategies around the world to help combat the COVID-19 has been directed to drug repositioning;however, these drugs are not specific to this new virus. Additionally, the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is highly heterogeneous, and the way of SARS-CoV-2 modulates the different systems in the host remains unidentified, despite recent discoveries. This complex and multifactorial response requires a comprehensive therapeutic approach, enabling the integration and refinement of therapeutic responses of a given single compound that has several action potentials. In this context, natural compounds, such as Curcumin, have shown beneficial effects on the progression of inflammatory diseases due to its numerous action mechanisms: antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and cytoprotective. These and many other effects of curcumin make it a promising target in the adjuvant treatment of COVID-19. Hence, the purpose of this review is to specifically point out how curcumin could interfere at different times/points during the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, providing a substantial contribution of curcumin as a new adjuvant therapy for the treatment of COVID-19.","Rattis, B.

This cross-sectional study evaluated relationships of loneliness with depression, anxiety, alcohol use, and drug use during COVID-19, and assessed perceived increases in these symptoms in young adults. Between April 22 and May 11, 2020, 1,008 participants ages 18-35 were recruited through social media to a one-time, online anonymous survey. Symptomatology was assessed using six scales. Perceived changes since COVID-19 were evaluated using 5-point Likert scales. Forty-nine percent of respondents reported loneliness scores above 50; 80% reported significant depressive symptoms; 61% reported moderate to severe anxiety; 30% disclosed harmful levels of drinking. While only 22% of the population reported using drugs, 38% reported severe drug use. Loneliness was associated with higher levels of mental health symptomatology. Participants reported significant increases across mental health and substance use symptoms since COVID-19. While direct impacts of COVID-19 could only be calculated with pre-pandemic assessments of these symptoms, estimates indicate elevated psychosocial symptomatology and suggest that symptoms could have worsened since the pandemic.

We tried to define the clinical characteristics, risk factors, laboratory, and imagining results of neonates with community-acquired COVID-19. METHODS: This prospective multicentered cohort study included 24 neonatal intensive care units around Turkey, wherein outpatient neonates with COVID-19 were registered in an online national database. Full-term and premature neonates diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study, whether hospitalized or followed up as ambulatory patients. Neonates without severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing or whose mothers had been diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy were excluded. RESULTS: Thirty-seven symptomatic neonates were included. The most frequent findings were fever, hypoxemia, and cough (49%, 41%, 27%, respectively). Oxygen administration (41%) and noninvasive ventilation (16%) were frequently required; however, mechanical ventilation (3%) was rarely needed. Median hospitalization was 11 days (1-35 days). One patient with Down syndrome and congenital cardiovascular disorders died in the study period.

The geo(graphs) approach is applied to visualize the geographical graph and produce maps of topological indexes, such as degree and vulnerability. A Brazilian data of 2016 is considered a case study, with more than five thousand cities and twenty-seven states. Based on the Network Robustness index, we show that the most efficient attack strategy shifts from a topological degree-based, for the all cities network, to a topological vulnerability-based, for a network considering the Brazilian States as nodes. Moreover, our results reveal that individual municipalities' actions do not cause a high impact on mobility restrain since they tend to be punctual and disconnected to the country scene as a whole.

The purpose of this review is to describe and analyze current urogynecologic guidelines for optimizing usage of telemedicine when treating women with pelvic floor disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Women managed by urogynecologists are on average older, and hence more likely to have comorbidities that make them susceptible to developing coronavirus disease 2019 with severe symptoms. Telemedicine is key in minimizing exposure without sacrificing treatments and quality of life. Recent studies published prior to the pandemic helped set the stage for successful components of virtual care. Nonsurgical options are crucial to beginning a treatment plan while elective surgeries are still restricted in many hospitals. Medication management and innovative technology, such as smart telephone applications, play a prominent role. The comprehensive literature review discussed here describes the degree of evidence supporting each management option, while also noting the limitations of telemedicine. SUMMARY: Telemedicine has opened a new door for the field of urogynecology allowing for continued safe, evidence-based care. The pandemic culture has tipped the balance away from surgery and toward nonsurgical treatments while attempting not to sacrifice outcomes or quality of care.","Serna-Gallegos, Tasha; Ninivaggio, Cara S",Curr Opin Obstet Gynecol,86,20

To prevent the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and treat patients with mild symptoms, sports stadiums and convention centers were reconstructed into mobile hospitals. RESEARCH QUESTION: It is unknown whether a mobile cabin hospital can provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 421 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a mobile cabin hospital in Wuhan from February 9, 2020, to March 5, 2020. Clinical data comprised patient age, sex, clinical presentation, chest imaging, nucleic acid testing, length of hospitalization, and outcomes. RESULTS: Of the patients who were discharged from the cabin hospital, 362 (86.0%) were categorized as recovered; 14.0% developed severe symptoms and were transferred to a designated hospital. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (60.6%) and cough (52.0%); 5.2% exhibited no obvious symptoms. High fever (> 39.0°C) was more common in severe cases than in recovered cases (18.6% vs 6.6%). The distribution of lung lesions was peripheral in 85.0% of patients, multifocal in 69.4%, and bilateral in 68.2%. The most common pattern was ground-glass opacity (67.7%), followed by patchy shadowing (49.2%). The incidence of patchy shadowing was higher in patients with severe disease (66.1%) than in those who recovered (31.8%, P < .0001). The median length of hospitalization was 17 days (interquartile range, 14-19 days), and the median time taken for positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results to become negative in recovered patients was 8 days (interquartile range, 6-10 days). INTERPRETATION: Mobile cabin hospitals provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms and offer an effective isolation area to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","Wang, Wei; Xin, Can; Xiong, Zhongwei; Yan, Xixi; Cai, Yuankun; Zhou, Keyao; Xie, Chuanshun; Zhang, Tingbao; Wu, Xiaohui; Liu, Kui; Li, Zhiqiang; Chen, Jincao",Chest,86,1

The dominant idea that ""we are in this together"" needs to be critically unpacked to understand the differential impact of the same pandemic on people with varied vulnerabilities. The concept of ""intersectional vulnerability"" has been key to understanding the unequal distribution of the pandemic risk. Using a gendered intersectional lens, this paper aims to understand the lived experiences of migrant women workers during the pandemic and their narratives of gendered inequality. Through a narrative study in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), India, from May to October 2020, this study brings out stories of precarity faced by five migrant women while battling the social, psychological, and economic effects of the pandemic. Loss of livelihood, home, savings, and prospects of a better future shape the narratives of these women. The pandemic exacerbated the already precarious positions of these women by creating a situation where-(a) patriarchal structures were further reinforced, and (b) losing gender solidarity and companionship through lockdown and social distancing.","Arora, Shubhda; Majumder, Mrinmoy","Gender, work and organization",86,1

When severe, it can lead to many common ear disorders such as otitis media with effusion, tympanic membrane retraction/perforation, and cholesteatoma. These diseases are prevalent in both the pediatric and adult population and significantly impact quality of life. The pathophysiology of ETD in the absence of an obstructive lesion has long been debated but is thought to be related to functional obstruction (i.e., inefficient tensor veli palatini muscle) and/or nasal cavity and nasopharyngeal inflammation. In the acute setting, the most common cause of nasal inflammation is an upper respiratory infection. When symptoms become chronic, however, the inflammation is thought to be associated with nasal irritants such as nasal allergens, i.e., allergic rhinitis (AR). The purpose of this review is to summarize our current understanding of the relationship between allergy and ETD. RECENT FINDINGS: Past studies are either lacking or have reported equivocal findings regarding the relationship between allergy and ETD, and the 2018 International Consensus Statement on Allergy and Rhinology: Allergic Rhinitis has deemed the current level of evidence linking AR and ETD as low quality. A more recent study using a large adult population dataset did support an association between AR and ETD, but did not find that all cases of ETD are related to allergies. Furthermore, current evidence suggests that the use of medications that can decrease intranasal inflammation, such as intranasal corticosteroids or oral antihistamines, does not result in significant symptomatic improvement in patients with ETD. However, these studies included all patients with ETD, and evidence is lacking regarding the treatment effect of these medications on the subset of patients with concurrent AR and ETD. Current best evidence does support an association between AR and ETD; however, not all patients with ETD suffer from AR, and vice versa. Further research is necessary to understand the mechanism behind this positive association and to elucidate the cause of chronic ETD in patients without associated allergies.","Juszczak, Hailey M; Loftus, Patricia A",Curr Allergy Asthma Rep,86,1

Spontaneous muscle hematomas (SMH) often occur in the rectus sheath or gluteal muscles. Risk factors include trauma, increased abdominal pressure, anticoagulation, and hypertension. We describe two cases of non-iatrogenic SMH in therapeutically anticoagulated COVID-19 patients. Case Report: 1. 64 year old Caucasian male with ARDS due to COVID-19 was treated with mechanical ventilation, proning, methylprednisolone, tocilizumab (TOZ), and azithromycin/hydroxychloroquine. Right popliteal-posterior tibial vein DVT led to full anticoagulation (FA) with enoxaparin. Later the hemoglobin dropped (12.2 to 6.1 g/dl). Imaging showed SMH in the left posterolateral chest wall and gluteus minimus requiring blood transfusions and cessation of FA. D-dimer was 1.2 μ g/ml. A week later, imaging showed increased hematoma size in the left chest wall and right gluteal area. After hemoglobin stabilized, he was started on DVT prophylaxis. He required tracheostomy/PEG tube and placement in a long term acute care (LTAC) facility where he had decannulation and PEG tube removal. Patient recovered fully and is home with normal function. 2. 27 year old Caucasian female with sepsis due to COVID-19 was treated with mechanical ventilation, dexamethasone, TOZ, convalescent plasma, colchicine, and remdesivir. D-dimer was 1.6 μ g/ml and FA was started with enoxaparin. After intubation, hemoglobin dropped (11-6.9 g/dl). Imaging showed SMH in left biceps and pectoralis. Decreased radial pulse and increased capillary refill time with enlarging forearm hematoma prompted arterial US and CT angiogram. No flow was seen in the distal left upper extremity. Fasciotomy of the left forearm and carpal tunnel was performed with adequate perfusion of radial and ulnar arteries. Debridement was required for the non-viable flexor carpi radialis, flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus. Patient was extubated and did well thereafter. Discussion: Thrombosis contributes much to the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. In a recent Veterans Health Administration study, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and cerebral ischemia/infarction comprised 9.3% of these patients. Despite the study's limitations, HESACOVID has shown that therapeutic enoxaparin is associated with fewer days on the ventilator and large reductions in D-dimer levels. Monitoring for SMH should be routinely performed on these patients. Research on optimal anticoagulation is necessary to assess the risk/benefit in this population. The bleeding risks are however less likely to cause mortality or disability as compared to the coagulation problems.","Mariano, A. T.; Abraham, R.

However, the effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines on T cell responses to common cold coronaviruses (CCCs) remains unknown. In this study, we analyzed CD4+ T cell responses to spike peptides from SARS-CoV-2 and 3 CCCs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) before and after study participants received Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Moderna (mRNA-1273) mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine recipients showed broad T cell responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and we identified 23 distinct targeted peptides in 9 participants, including 1 peptide that was targeted in 6 individuals. Only 4 of these 23 targeted peptides would potentially be affected by mutations in the UK (B.1.1.7) and South African (B.1.351) variants, and CD4+ T cells from vaccine recipients recognized the 2 variant spike proteins as effectively as they recognized the spike protein from the ancestral virus. Interestingly, we observed a 3-fold increase in the CD4+ T cell responses to HCoV-NL63 spike peptides after vaccination. Our results suggest that T cell responses elicited or enhanced by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines may be able to control SARS-CoV-2 variants and lead to cross-protection against some endemic coronaviruses.","Woldemeskel, Bezawit A; Garliss, Caroline C; Blankson, Joel N",J. clin. invest,86,2

Using the method, we estimate that risks for a 90-day period at the median daily summertime U.S. county confirmed COVID-19 case incidence of 10.8 per 100,000 and pre-pandemic contact rates range from 0.4 to 8.9 per 100,000 for the four deciles of age between 20 and 60 years. The corresponding 90-day period risk of hospitalization ranges from 13.7 to 69.2 per 100,000. Assuming a non-household secondary infection risk of 4% and pre-pandemic contact rates, the share of transmissions attributable to household settings ranges from 73% to 78%. These estimates are sensitive to the parameter assumptions; nevertheless, they are comparable to the COVID-19 hospitalization and fatality rates observed over the time period. We conclude that individual risk of hospitalization and death from SARS-CoV-2 infection is calculable from publicly available data sources. Access to publicly reported infection incidence data by setting and other exposure characteristics along with setting specific estimates of secondary infection risk would allow for more precise individual risk estimation.","Bhatia, Rajiv; Klausner, Jeffrey",PLoS One,86,23

It is thus necessary to promote PPE rational use, highlighting possible differences in terms of efficacy and promoting an effective technique to reuse them. METHODS: A literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar, and from the 25 top cited articles, 15 were selected for relevance and impact. RESULTS: Most studies on previous respiratory virus epidemics to date suggest surgical masks are not inferior compared with N95 respirators in terms of protective efficacy among healthcare workers. Therefore, the use of N95 respirators should be limited to high-risk situations. Concerning respirator reuse, highly energetic, short-wave, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) at 254 nm was determined to decontaminate N95 respirators from viral respiratory agents, but UVGI requires careful consideration of the type of respirator and of the biologic target. CONCLUSIONS: Rational use and successful reuse of respirators can help in the shortage of PPE during a pandemic. Further studies testing UVGI and other decontamination techniques are an unmet need. The definitive answer to pandemic issues can be found in artificial intelligence and deep learning. These groundbreaking modalities could help in identifying high-risk patients and in suggesting appropriate types and use of PPE.","Boskoski, Ivo; Gallo, Camilla; Wallace, Michael B; Costamagna, Guido",Gastrointest Endosc,86,0

A Review,13.499107,9.101062,2021,"Given vaccine dose shortages and logistical challenges, various deployment strategies are being proposed to increase population immunity levels to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Two critical issues arise: How timing of delivery of the second dose will affect infection dynamics and how it will affect prospects for the evolution of viral immune escape via a buildup of partially immune individuals. Both hinge on the robustness of the immune response elicited by a single dose as compared with natural and two-dose immunity. Building on an existing immuno-epidemiological model, we find that in the short term, focusing on one dose generally decreases infections, but that longer-term outcomes depend on this relative immune robustness. We then explore three scenarios of selection and find that a one-dose policy may increase the potential for antigenic evolution under certain conditions of partial population immunity. We highlight the critical need to test viral loads and quantify immune responses after one vaccine dose and to ramp up vaccination efforts globally.","Saad-Roy, Chadi M; Morris, Sinead E; Metcalf, C Jessica E; Mina, Michael J; Baker, Rachel E; Farrar, Jeremy; Holmes, Edward C; Pybus, Oliver G; Graham, Andrea L; Levin, Simon A; Grenfell, Bryan T; Wagner, Caroline E",Science,86,1

HLH therapy includes dexamethasone and etoposide. However, therapy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Anakinra, a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, has been reported to treat macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), rheumatic sHLH. We report our experience with anakinra to treat patients with nonrheumatic secondary HLH (sHLH). PROCEDURE: Six children were diagnosed with HLH from December 2014 to August 2016 and were treated with subcutaneous anakinra (6-10 mg/kg/day divided over four doses) with or without dexamethasone (10 mg/m2 /day). Therapy was either escalated or weaned based on clinical and laboratory response. RESULTS: Five of six patients were treated with anakinra and dexamethasone, and one with anakinra alone due to active cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis. The median age of diagnosis was 1.8 years (range 0.8-14.9 years). No pathogenic mutations associated with HLH were identified, but three of six possessed genetic variants of unknown significance. Infectious triggers were identified for four patients and two patients had malignancies. The average treatment duration was 8 weeks with 3.5-5.5 years of follow up. No patient needed escalation of therapy to include etoposide. All patients achieved remission. Anakinra was well tolerated without significant adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Initial treatment with anakinra (with or without dexamethasone) is a feasible treatment alternative for patients with secondary HLH and may allow for avoidance of etoposide. We recommend early initiation of anakinra when HLH is suspected. A broader investigation of the use of anakinra as a first-line agent for HLH is ongoing.","Bami, Sakshi; Vagrecha, Anshul; Soberman, Danielle; Badawi, Mohamad; Cannone, Daniel; Lipton, Jeffrey M; Cron, Randy Q; Levy, Carolyn Fein",Pediatr Blood Cancer,86,24

METHODS: Fifteen molecular laboratories from seven different European countries compared 4 weeks of national lockdown to a corresponding period in 2019, in terms of tissue and/or plasma-based molecular test workload, analytical platforms adopted, number of cases undergoing programmed death-ligand1 (PD-L1) expression assessment and DNA-based molecular tests turnaround time. RESULTS: In most laboratories (80.0%), tissue-based molecular test workload was reduced. In 40.0% of laboratories (6/15), the decrease was >25%, and in one, reduction was as high as 80.0%. In this instance, a concomitant increase in liquid biopsy was reported (60.0%). Remarkably, in 33.3% of the laboratories, real-time PCR (RT-PCR)-based methodologies increased, whereas highly multiplexing assays approaches decreased. Most laboratories (88.9%) did not report significant variations in PD-L1 volume testing. CONCLUSIONS: The workload of molecular testing for patients with advanced-stage lung cancer during the lockdown showed little variations.

BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 has negatively affected some individuals, but resilience plays a decisive role in the response of individuals under pressure and can help them deal with pressure more effectively. DESIGN: The cross-sectional descriptive correlational survey was reported in line with the STROBE guidelines. SUBJECT AND SETTING: In total, 296 patients from FangCang Hospital in Wuhan, Hubei, China, with mild symptoms of COVID-19 were recruited. METHODS: Participants were recruited through convenience sampling. The data collected included their demographic information, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: A small number of patients in this study had above threshold anxiety (subthreshold anxiety and major anxiety) and depression (subthreshold depression and major depression). The mean total resilience score of the participants was slightly below the normal level of ordinary Chinese adults. Resilience was inversely associated with and was a protective factor for both anxiety and depression in our samples. Risk factors for anxiety include being female and having colleagues with COVID-19, while a risk factor for depression was having family members with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that after taking the general demographics into consideration, higher levels of resilience were associated with lower anxiety and depression among mild COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Health professionals, especially clinical nurses, need to be aware of the psychological status of COVID-19 patients and promote resilience to improve their mental health.","Zhang, Jie; Yang, Zhen; Wang, Xiao; Li, Juan; Dong, Lili; Wang, Fusheng; Li, Yifei; Wei, Ruihong; Zhang, Jingping",J. clin. nurs,86,21

We examined the effect of prior infection with ancestral (D614G) or Beta variants on Ad26.COV2.S immunogenicity approximately 28 days post-vaccination. We compared healthcare workers who were SARS-CoV-2 naive (n=20), to those infected during the first wave prior to the emergence of Beta (n=20), and those infected in the second wave (n=20), when Beta was the dominant variant. We demonstrate that a priming exposure from infection significantly increased the magnitude of spike binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity (ADCC) against D614G, Beta and Delta variants. The magnitude of antibody boosting was similar in both waves, despite the longer time interval between wave 1 infection and vaccination (7 months), compared to wave 2 (2 months). ADCC and binding cross-reactivity was similar in both waves. However, neutralization cross-reactivity varied by wave, showing that the antibody repertoire was shaped by the spike sequence of the infecting variant. Robust CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to spike of similar or higher magnitude as those elicited by infection were induced after vaccination. In contrast to antibody responses, prior infection was not required for the generation of high magnitude T cell responses, and T cell recognition of the Beta variant was fully preserved. Therefore, Ad26.COV2.S vaccination following prior infection, even >6 months previously, may result in substantially enhanced protection against COVID-19, of particular relevance in settings of high SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. Furthermore, the dominant impact of the infecting variant on neutralization breadth after vaccination has important implications for the design of second-generation vaccines based on variants of concern.","Keeton, Roanne; Richardson, Simone I; Moyo-Gwete, Thandeka; Hermanus, Tandile; Tincho, Marius B; Benede, Ntombi; Manamela, Nelia P; Baguma, Richard; Makhado, Zanele; Ngomti, Amkele; Motlou, Thopisang; Mennen, Mathilda; Chinoyi, Lionel; Skelem, Sango; Maboreke, Hazel; Doolabh, Deelan; Iranzadeh, Arash; Otter, Ashley; Brooks, Tim; Noursadeghi, Mahdad; Moon, James; Blackburn, Jonathan; Hsiao, Nei-Yuan; Williamson, Carolyn; Riou, Catherine; Goga, Ameena; Garrett, Nigel; Bekker, Linda-Gail; Gray, Glenda; Ntusi, Ntobeko A.B; Moore, Penny L; Burgers, Wendy A",,86,26

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of the clinical data, preoperative anti-tuberculosis duration, and postoperative recurrence rate in 263 patients with chest wall tuberculosis spanning 5 years. Results: Overall, 263 patients were treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs for about ± 12.49 days during the preoperative period. Simple chest wall tuberculosis was treated for ± 5.87 days and composite chest wall tuberculosis for ± 5.11 days. The postoperative recurrence rate of chest wall tuberculosis was 3.80%, which was close to or lower than the recurrence rate of routine preoperative anti-tuberculous therapy in patients subjected to ultra-short-range anti-tuberculosis treatment before surgery. Conclusion: Preoperative ultra-short-course chemotherapy combined with surgical treatment of chest wall tuberculosis did not increase the recurrence rate of chest wall tuberculosis; moreover, it could effectively shorten hospitalization time and improve patient compliance.

We recently developed an in-homogeneous multi-""sub-populations"" (multi-compartments: susceptible, exposed, pre-symptomatic, infectious, recovered) model, that accounts for the spatial in-homogeneous spreading of the infection and shown, for a variety of examples, how the epidemic curves are highly sensitive to location of epicenters, non-uniform population density, and local restrictions. In the present work we tested our model against real-life data from South Carolina during the period May 22 to July 22 (2020), that was available in the form of infection heat-maps and conventional epidemic curves. During this period, minimal restrictions have been employed, which allowed us to assume that the local reproduction number is constant in time. We accounted for the non-uniform population density in South Carolina using data from NASA, and predicted the evolution of infection heat-maps during the studied period. Comparing the predicted heat-maps with those observed, we find high qualitative resemblance. Moreover, the Pearsons correlation coefficient is relatively high and does not get lower than 0.8, thus validating our model against real-world data. We conclude that our model accounts for the major effects controlling spatial in-homogeneous spreading of the disease. Inclusion of additional sub-populations (compartments), in the spirit of several recently developed models for COVID-19, can be easily performed within our mathematical framework.","Granek, Rony; Tsori, Yoav",,86,14

The common mild symptoms include body aches, dry cough, fatigue, low-grade fever, nasal congestion, and sore throat. More severe COVID-19 symptoms are typical of pneumonia, and upon progression, the patient's condition can worsen with severe respiratory and cardiac problems. Currently, there is no drug or vaccine for curing patients. It has been observed that people with challenged immunity are highly prone to SARS CoV-2 infection and least likely to recover. Also, older adults and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe forms of COVID-19. We are suggesting here a strategy for the COVID-19 treatment that could be effective in curing the patients in the current scenario when no efficient medicine or Vaccine is currently available, and Clinicians solely depend upon the performing trials with drugs with known antiviral activities. Our proposed strategy is based on the compilation of published scientific research and concepts. The different published research indicates the success of a similar strategy in different physiological conditions, and such a strategy is widely studied at the cellular level and in animal models.","Mani Mishra, Pushpendra; Uversky, Vladimir N; Nandi, Chayan K",Med Hypotheses,86,20

However, its poor light transmission makes it challenging to directly and clearly monitor cell behaviors (e.g., growth and proliferation) on the paper-based platform using optical microscope. In this work, we developed a transparent microcrystalline cellulose/polyvinyl alcohol (MCC/PVA) paper with irregular pores through dissolution and regeneration of microcrystalline nanocellulose (MCC), addition of porogen reagent (NaCl) and subsequently dipping in PVA solutions. The transparent MCC paper displays high porosity (up to 90%), adjustable pore size (between 23 µm and 46 µm) and large thickness (from 315 µm to 436 µm) and high light transmission under water (>95%). Through further modification of transparent MCC paper with PVA, the obtained transparent MCC/PVA paper shows enhanced mechanical properties (dry and wet strengths), good hydrophilicity (with a contact angle of 70.8°) and improved biocompatibility (cell viability up to 90%). By stacking and destacking multiple layers of the transparent MCC/PVA paper, it has been used for both 2D and 3D cell culture platforms. The transparent MCC/PVA paper under water enables both direct observation of cell morphology by optical microscope via naked eyes and fluorescence microscope after staining. We envision that the developed transparent MCC/PVA paper holds great potential for future applications in various bioanalytical and biomedical fields, such as drug screening, tissue engineering and organ-on-chips.","Tang, Ruihua; Liu, Li Na; Li, Min; Yao, Xue; Yang, Yaowei; Zhang, Sufeng; Li, Fei",Anal. chem,86,16

METHODS: We collected individual information and aggregated data on COVID-19 cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 to April 17, 2020. We accounted for right-censoring to estimate the CFR and explored the risk factors for mortality. We fitted Weibull, gamma, and lognormal distributions to time-to-event data using maximum-likelihood estimation. RESULTS: We analyzed 82,719 laboratory-confirmed cases reported in mainland China, including 4,632 deaths, and 77,029 discharges. The estimated CFR was 5.65% (95%CI: 5.50%-5.81%) nationally, with highest estimate in Wuhan (7.71%), and lowest in provinces outside Hubei (0.86%). The fatality risk among critical patients was 3.6 times that of all patients, and 0.8-10.3 fold higher than that of mild-to-severe patients. Older age (OR 1.14 per year; 95%CI: 1.11-1.16), and being male (OR 1.83; 95%CI: 1.10-3.04) were risk factors for mortality. The time from symptom onset to first healthcare consultation, time from symptom onset to laboratory confirmation, and time from symptom onset to hospitalization were consistently longer for deceased patients than for those who recovered. CONCLUSIONS: Our CFR estimates based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained in mainland China suggest that COVID-19 is more severe than the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients, particularly in Wuhan. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the severity of the first wave of the pandemic in China.

Obstetricians and midwives, among other medical staff, are tackling COVID-19 and are under immense psychological stress. AIMS: We aimed to survey the mental health of non-infectious disease specialist staff, specifically obstetricians and midwives, working in officially designated hospitals treating patients with COVID-19. METHOD: A nationwide online survey was conducted from 7 March to 17 March 2020 investigating the mental health of obstetricians and midwives (who were not themselves infected with COVID-19) working in hospitals treating patients with COVID-19. We used the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale and the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) to assess their symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia. RESULTS: A total of 885 (41.6%), 609 (28.6%) and 729 (34.3%) obstetricians and midwives reported depression (PHQ-9 &#8805; 5), anxiety (GAD-7 &#8805; 5) and insomnia (ISI &#8805; 8), respectively, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless of whether or not they had direct contact with patients with COVID-19, obstetricians and midwives were more likely to report mild and moderate depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with before the pandemic. Those who had direct contact with patients with COVID-19 were more likely to report depression and insomnia than those who did not. Those who had sufficient protective equipment or training were less likely to report depression, anxiety and insomnia than those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that non-infectious disease specialist staff have experienced varying, but increased levels of depression, anxiety and insomnia during this COVID-19 pandemic, which could be reduced by sufficient levels of protective equipment and occupational COVID-19 workplace training.","Liu, Tao; Zheng, Zheng; Sha, Xiaoyan; Liu, Huishu; Zheng, Wenjing; Su, Huanxing; Xu, Guiyun; Su, Kuan-Pin; So, Kwok-Fai; Lin, Kangguang",BJPsych Open,86,28

Here, we developed a personal passive air sampler (PPAS) composed of a redox dye, o-dianisidine, in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sheet. o-Dianisidine readily reacts with gaseous oxidants generated by bleach usage, and its color changes as the reaction progresses; hence, personal exposure to effective chlorine could be easily detected by the naked eye, while cumulative exposure could be determined by measuring concentrations of o-dianisidine reacting with it. The PPAS was calibrated, and a sampling rate of 0.00253 m3 /h was obtained using a small test chamber. The PPAS was tested with the help of ten volunteers whose personal exposure to Cl2 -equivalent gas was estimated after bathrooms were cleaned using spray and liquid-type household disinfection products, and the accumulated exposure-gas concentrations ranged from 69 to 408 ppbv and 148 to 435 ppbv, respectively. These PPAS-derived exposure concentrations were approximately two orders lower than those estimated using ConsExpo, suggesting a significant overestimation by prevailing screening models, possibly due to the ignorance of transformation reactions.","Ha, Yeonjeong; Kim, Yoonsub; Song, Eugene; Yoo, Hyun Jung; Kwon, Jung-Hwan",Indoor air,86,6

Yield of activated carbon (AC) and catalyst (CAT), as well as density of SO3H groups and total acidity, was analyzed in an entirely random designed experiment using multiple linear regression, one-way ANOVA, and Tukey's post hoc test. Time, temperature, dosage of KOH, and ratio of H2SO4/AC were the predictor variables with 3 levels each, at a significance level of &#945; = .05. A significant yield variation portion of AC was explained by the experimental factors (R2 = .891, F (3, 23) = 62.9, p < .0001), as did the yield of CAT (R2 = .960, F (3, 23) = 185.7, p < .0001), density of SO3H (R2 = .969, F (3, 23) = 242.2, p < .0001), and total acidity (R2 = .973, F (3, 23) = 280.6, p < .0001). Levels of time (p = .001) and KOH dosage (p = .006) were significant to the yield of AC, and temperature levels were not influent on density of SO3H (p = .731) or total acidity (p = .762).

This study drew on two nationally representative samples to compare the prevalence rate of anxiety in the U.S. before and during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2) screening tool was used to detect the proportion of US adults screening positive for high levels of anxiety symptoms. Anxiety symptoms was assessed in 2019 using the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS; N = 30,915) and during the pandemic using biweekly surveys collected as part of the Understanding America Study (UAS; N=8,022 Obs.=121,768) between March and December 2020. RESULTS: The proportion of participants with high levels of anxiety symptoms increased significantly from 8.1% (95% CI[7.7, 8.5]) in 2019 to 21.4% (95% CI[19.9, 22.9]) at the beginning of April, 2020. The prevalence then declined to 11.4% (95% CI[10.3, 12.5]) in May and remained 3% above 2019 levels until December 2020. This pattern of increasing anxiety between 2019 and April 2020 followed by a rapid decrease in anxiety was identified across all demographic characteristics examined. LIMITATIONS: The NHIS and UAS samples differ in their sampling and mode of administration which may bias comparisons between samples. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety symptoms increased markedly during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced quickly as stay-at-home orders were lifted. These findings highlight the importance of providing mental health supports during future lockdowns and suggest that resilience in mental health may have been a key population-level response to the demands of the pandemic.","Daly, Michael; Robinson, Eric",J Affect Disord,86,20

Thus, individuals with SCI are at high risk of developing COVID-19 related RC. Results of a SCI clinical trial showed a supervised respiratory muscle training (RMT) program decreased risk of developing RC. The feasibility of conducting unsupervised RMT is not well documented. Four publications (n = 117) were identified in which unsupervised RMT was performed. Significant improvements in respiratory outcomes were reported in two studies: Maximal Inspiratory and Expiratory Pressure (MIP40% and MEP25%, respectively), Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF9%), seated and supine Forced Vital Capacity (FVC23% and 26%, respectively), and Peak Cough Flow (28%). This review and case report will attempt to show that an inspiratory muscle training (IMT) home exercise program (HEP) is feasible and may prepare the respiratory system for RC associated with COVID-19 in patients with SCI. CASE PRESENTATION: A 23-year-old with tetraplegia (P1), history of mechanical ventilation, and hospitalization for RC, completed 27 IMT HEP sessions in one month. MIP and sustained MIP (SMIP) increased from baseline by 28% and 26.5%, respectively. Expiratory volumes and rates also improved (FVC, FEV1, and PEF: 11.7%, 8.3%, and 14.2%, respectively). DISCUSSION: The effects of COVID-19 on patients with SCI remains inconclusive, but recent literature and the results of this case suggest that unsupervised IMT is feasible and may limit the severity of RC in patients with SCI who contract COVID-19.","Palermo, Anne E; Cahalin, Lawrence P; Nash, Mark S",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,86,10

Marginalization in the South Asian polity, unequal power relations, and poor policy responses deter Adivasi populations' rights and opportunities for health gains and dignity. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is likely to result in a disproportionate share of infections and deaths among the Adivasis, given poor social conditions and exclusions. Poor health of indigenous people, inequalities between indigenous and non-indigenous groups, and failures in enforcing constitutional and legal provisions to reclaim indigenous land and cultural identity herald deeper structural and political fractures. This article unravels health inequalities between the Adivasis and non-Adivasi populations in their social context based on a critical review of secondary sources. We call for intersectoral policies and integrated health care services to address systemic inequalities, discrimination, power asymmetries, and consequent poor health outcomes.

To make a proper distribution schedule, we considered the timing of supply and demand. In the present study, a ""sequential time window"" is used to describe the time to generate of supply and demand and the time of supply delivery. Then, considering the sequential time window, we proposed two multiobjective scheduling models with the consideration of demand uncertainty; two multiobjective stochastic programming models were also proposed to solve the scheduling models. Moreover, this paper describes a simulation that was performed based on a first-aid medicine distribution problem during a Wenchuan earthquake response. The simulation results show that the methodologies proposed in this paper provide effective schedules for the distribution of first-aid medicine. The developed distribution schedule enables some supplies in the former time windows to be used in latter time windows. This schedule increases the utility of limited stocks and avoids the risk that all the supplies are used in the short-term, leaving no supplies for long-term use.","Fang, Jiaqi; Hou, Hanping; Lu, Changxiang; Pang, Haiyun; Deng, Qingshan; Ye, Yong; Pan, Lingle",PLoS One,86,20

The core algorithm for this measurement is the estimation of tiny chest/abdominal motions induced by respiration, and the fundamental challenge is motion sensitivity. Though prior arts reported on the validation with real human subjects, there is no thorough/rigorous benchmark to quantify the sensitivities and boundary conditions of motion-based core respiratory algorithms that measure sub-pixel displacement between video frames. In this paper, we designed a setup with a fully-controllable physical phantom to investigate the essence of core algorithms, together with a mathematical model incorporating two motion estimation strategies and three spatial representations, leading to six algorithmic combinations for respiratory signal extraction. Their promises and limitations are discussed and clarified via the phantom benchmark.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients admitted to our institution with confirmed COVID-19 status by polymerase chain reaction between March 1, 2020, and May 13, 2020, and selected those who underwent both d-dimer and venous duplex ultrasound examination. This cohort was divided into two groups, those with and without DVT based on duplex ultrasound examination. These groups were then compared to determine the value of d-dimer in establishing this diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 1170 patients were admitted with COVID-19, of which 158 were selected for this study. Of the 158, there were 52 patients with DVT and 106 without DVT. There were no differences in sex, age, race, or ethnicity between groups. Diabetes and routine hemodialysis were less commonly seen in the group with DVT. More than 90% of patients in both groups received prophylactic anticoagulation, but the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis was not predictive of DVT. All patients had elevated acute-phase d-dimer levels using conventional criteria, and 154 of the 158 (97.5%) had elevated levels with age-adjusted criteria (mean d-dimer 16,163 ± 5395 ng/mL). Those with DVT had higher acute-phase d-dimer levels than those without DVT (median, 13,602 [interquartile range, 6616-36,543 ng/mL] vs 2880 [interquartile range, 1030-9126 ng/mL], P < .001). An optimal d-dimer cutoff of 6494 ng/mL was determined to differentiate those with and without DVT (sensitivity 80.8%, specificity 68.9%, negative predictive value 88.0%). Wells DVT criteria was not found to be a significant predictor of DVT. Elevated d-dimer as defined by our optimal metric was a statistically significant predictor of DVT in both univariate and multivariable analyses when adjusting for other factors (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% confidence interval, 2.79-13.39; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: d-dimer levels are uniformly elevated in patients with COVID-19. Although standard predictive criteria failed to predict DVT, our analysis showed a d-dimer of less than 6494 ng/mL may exclude DVT, potentially limiting the need for venous duplex ultrasound examination.","Cho, Edward S; McClelland, Paul H; Cheng, Olivia; Kim, Yuri; Hu, James; Zenilman, Michael E; D039,; Ayala, Marcus",J.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Can a transparent deep learning (DL) model predict the need for MV in hospitalized patients and those with COVID-19 up to 24 hours in advance? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We trained and externally validated a transparent DL algorithm to predict the future need for MV in hospitalized patients, including those with COVID-19, using commonly available data in electronic health records. Additionally, commonly used clinical criteria (heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, FiO2 and pH) were used to assess future need for MV. Performance of the algorithm was evaluated using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value. RESULTS: We obtained data from over 30,000 ICU patients (including over 700 patients with COVID-19) from two academic medical centers. The performance of the model with a 24-hour prediction horizon at the development and validation sites was comparable (AUC of 0.895 versus 0.882, respectively), providing significant improvement over traditional clinical criteria (p<0.001). Prospective validation of the algorithm among patients with COVID-19 yielded AUCs in the range 0.918-0.943.

Among those, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are extremely versatile and, therefore, widely prescribed. Moreover, they are commonly considered as having a better safety profile compared to other antidepressants. For these reasons, when it comes to off-label prescribing, SSRIs rank among the top positions. In this review, we present the state of the art of off-label applications of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, ranging from migraine prophylaxis to SARS-CoV-2 antiviral properties. Research on SSRIs provided significant evidence in the treatment of premature ejaculation, both with the on-label dapoxetine 30 mg and the off-label paroxetine 20 mg. However, other than serotoninergic syndrome, serious conditions like increased bleeding rates, hyponatremia, hepatoxicity, and post-SSRIs sexual dysfunctions, are consistently more prominent when using such compounds. These insidious side effects might be frequently underestimated during common clinical practice, especially by non-psychiatrists. For this reason, some points must be addressed when using SSRIs. Among these, a psychiatric evaluation before every administration that falls outside the regulatory agencies-approved guidelines has to be considered mandatory. For these reasons, we aim with the present article to identify the risks of inappropriate uses and to advocate the need to actively boost research encouraging future clinical trials on this topic.","Jannini, Tommaso B; Di Lorenzo, Giorgio; Bianciardi, Emanuela; Niolu, Cinzia; Toscano, Massimiliano; Ciocca, Giacomo; Jannini, Emmanuele A; Siracusano, Alberto",Curr. neuropharmacol,86,6

The DEGs were significantly involved in the immune and inflammatory response. The pathway analysis revealed the DEGs were found in influenza A, measles, cytokine signaling in the immune system, interleukin-4, interleukin -13, interleukin -17 signaling, and TNF signaling pathways.

The regulatory network analysis showed significant transcription factors (TFs) that target DEGs, namely FOXC1, GATA2, YY1, FOXL1, NFKB1. Finally, drug repositioning analysis was performed with these 10 hub genes and showed that in silico validated three drugs with molecular docking. The transcriptomics signatures, molecular pathways, and regulatory biomolecules shed light on candidate biomarkers and drug targets which have potential roles to manage COVID-19. ICAM1 and TNFAIP3 were the key hubs that have demonstrated good binding affinities with repurposed drug candidates. Dabrafenib, radicicol, and AT-7519 were the top-scored repurposed drugs that showed efficient docking results when they tested with hub genes. The identified drugs should be further evaluated in molecular level wet-lab experiments in prior to clinical studies in the treatment of COVID-19.","Islam, Tania; Rahman, Md Rezanur; Aydin, Busra; Beklen, Hande; Arga, Kazim Yalcin; Shahjaman, Md",Eur J Pharmacol,86,30

Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV enter host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is expressed in various human organs. We have reviewed previously published studies on SARS and recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), confirming that many other organs besides the lungs are vulnerable to the virus. ACE2 catalyzes angiotensin II conversion to angiotensin-(1-7), and the ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/MAS axis counteracts the negative effects of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which plays important roles in maintaining the physiological and pathophysiological balance of the body. In addition to the direct viral effects and inflammatory and immune factors associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis, ACE2 downregulation and the imbalance between the RAS and ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/MAS after infection may also contribute to multiple organ injury in COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, which binds to ACE2, is a potential target for developing specific drugs, antibodies, and vaccines. Restoring the balance between the RAS and ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/MAS may help attenuate organ injuries. SARS-CoV-2 enters lung cells via the ACE2 receptor. The cell-free and macrophage-phagocytosed virus can spread to other organs and infect ACE2-expressing cells at local sites, causing multi-organ injury.","Ni, Wentao; Yang, Xiuwen; Yang, Deqing; Bao, Jing; Li, Ran; Xiao, Yongjiu; Hou, Chang; Wang, Haibin; Liu, Jie; Yang, Donghong; Xu, Yu; Cao, Zhaolong; Gao, Zhancheng",Crit Care,86,24

It is likely that IAV interacts with histones during infection. We show that histone H4 binds to IAV and aggregates viral particles. In addition, histone H4 markedly potentiates IAV induced neutrophil respiratory burst responses. Prior studies have shown reactive oxidants to be detrimental during severe IAV infection. C reactive protein (CRP) and surfactant protein D (SP-D) rise during IAV infection. We now show that both of these innate immune proteins bind to histone H4 and significantly down regulate respiratory burst and other responses to histone H4. Isolated constructs composed only of the neck and carbohydrate recognition domain of SP-D also bind to histone H4 and partially limit neutrophil responses to it. These studies indicate that complexes formed of histones and IAV are a potent neutrophil activating stimulus. This finding could account for excess inflammation during IAV or other severe viral infections. The ability of CRP and SP-D to bind to histone H4 may be part of a protective response against excessive inflammation in vivo.","Hsieh, I-Ni; White, Mitchell; Hoeksema, Marloes; Deluna, Xavier; Hartshorn, Kevan",PLoS One,86,3

The Consortium of West Region Colleges of Veterinary Medicine established the Regional Teaching Academy (RTA) with the focus of ""Making Teaching Matter."" The objective of the RTA's first effort, the Faculty Development Initiative (FDI), was to develop a multi-institutional faculty development program for veterinary educators to learn about and integrate effective teaching methods. In 2016, the Veterinary Educator Teaching and Scholarship (VETS) program was piloted at Oregon State University's College of Veterinary Medicine. This article uses a case study approach to program evaluation of the VETS program. We describe the VETS program, participants' perceptions, participants' teaching method integration, and lessons learned. A modified Kirkpatrick Model (MKM) was used to categorize program outcomes and impact. Quantitative data are presented as descriptive statistics, and qualitative data are presented as the themes that emerged from participant survey comments and post-program focus groups. Results indicated outcomes and impacts that included participants' perceptions of the program, changes in participant attitude toward teaching and learning, an increase in the knowledge level of participants, self-reported changes in participant behaviors, and changes in practices and structure at the college level. Lessons learned indicate that the following are essential for program success: (1) providing institutional and financial support; (2) creating a community of practice (COP) of faculty development facilitators, and (3) developing a program that addresses the needs of faculty and member institutions.","Gordon-Ross, Paul N; Kovacs, Suzie J; Halsey, Rachel L; West, Andrew B; Smith, Martin H",J Vet Med Educ,86,10

The binding process is initiated when the receptor binding domain (RBD) of at least one protomer switches from a ""down"" (closed) to an ""up"" (open) state. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations and two-dimensional replica exchange umbrella sampling calculations to investigate the transition between the two S-protein conformations with and without glycosylation. We show that the glycosylated spike has a higher barrier to opening than the non-glycosylated one with comparable populations of the down and up states. In contrast, we observed that the up conformation is favored without glycans. Analysis of the S-protein opening pathway reveals that glycans at N165 and N122 interfere with hydrogen bonds between the RBD and the N-terminal domain in the up state. We also identify roles for glycans at N165 and N343 in stabilizing the down and up states. Finally we estimate how epitope exposure for several known antibodies changes along the opening path. We find that the epitope of the BD-368-2 antibody remains exposed irrespective of the S-protein conformation, explaining the high efficacy of this antibody.

METHODS: Results of an observational assessment of operational and clinical pharmacy services at a community teaching hospital during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic are presented. Service outcomes of the inpatient pharmacy were evaluated from February 1 to April 8, 2020. Outcomes during the weeks preceding the first COVID-19 admission (February 1 to March 11, 2020) and during the pandemic period (March 12 to April 8, 2020) were compared. Evaluated outcomes included daily order verifications, clinical interventions, and usage of relevant medications. An exploratory statistical analysis was conducted using Student's t test. RESULTS: During the pandemic period, the number of new order verifications decreased from approximately 5,000 orders per day to 3,300 orders per day (P < 0.01), a reduction of 30% during the first 4 weeks of the pandemic compared to the weeks prior. Average daily pharmacokinetic dosing consults were reduced in the pandemic period (from 82 to 67; P < 0.01) compared to the prepandemic period; however, total daily pharmacist interventions did not differ significantly (473 vs 456; P = 0.68).

It is a serious respiratory disease and caused more than 100 million of deaths in the world. WHO named it COVIA-19 and there is no effective targeted drug for it. The main treatment strategies include chemical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and biologics. Due to SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike proteins (S proteins) on its envelope to infect human cells, monoclonal antibodies that neutralize the S protein have become one of the hot research areas in the current research and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we reviewed the antibodies that have been reported to have neutralizing activity against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to their different binding epitope regions in RBD or NTD, they are classified, and the mechanism of the representative antibodies in each category is discussed in depth, which provides potential foundation for future antibody and vaccine therapy and the development of antibody cocktails against SARS-CoV-2 mutants.","Jin, Dongfu; Wei, Jing; Sun, Jian",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,86,16

We hypothesized that machine learning-based classifiers can reliably distinguish the CXR images of COVID-19 patients from other forms of pneumonia. We used a dimensionality reduction method to generate a set of optimal features of CXR images to build an efficient machine learning classifier that can distinguish COVID-19 cases from non-COVID-19 cases with high accuracy and sensitivity. By using global features of the whole CXR images, we successfully implemented our classifier using a relatively small dataset of CXR images.

But the security of these systems themselves has not been fully explored, which poses risks in applying these systems. We propose a physical attack method with small bulbs on a board against the state of-the-art pedestrian detectors. Our goal is to make infrared pedestrian detectors unable to detect real-world pedestrians. Towards this goal, we first showed that it is possible to use two kinds of patches to attack the infrared pedestrian detector based on YOLOv3. The average precision (AP) dropped by 64.12% in the digital world, while a blank board with the same size caused the AP to drop by 29.69% only. After that, we designed and manufactured a physical board and successfully attacked YOLOv3 in the real world. In recorded videos, the physical board caused AP of the target detector to drop by 34.48%, while a blank board with the same size caused the AP to drop by 14.91% only.

This virus causes an economically and, possibly, environmentally, important loss in the poultry industry. Therefore, research into the avian coronavirus in various species of birds is required. The Eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) is an endemic bird to Indonesia and Northern Australia and often kept as pets. At present, there has been limited information about avian coronavirus infection among birds. This study aimed to determine the presence of and to characterize avian coronavirus isolated from Eclectus parrots in Indonesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cloacal swab samples were taken from 10 healthy Eclectus parrots (E. roratus). Each isolate was propagated into specific pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs. The presence of avian coronavirus was determined using three sets of primers targeting the 3’ untranslated region (3’-UTR) of avian coronavirus (UTR41+/11−), the N gene of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBVN+/−), and the S1 gene of the IBV (XCE2+/XCE2−). The infectious bronchitis vaccine strain H120 was used as a positive control. Resulting positive bands were sequenced for the S1 gene. RESULTS: None of the isolates was positive for the 3’-UTR, four isolates were positive for the N gene of infectious bronchitis, and two isolates were positive for the S1 gene of the IBV. However, only one isolate (parrot/Indonesia/BX9/16) was sequenced for the partial S1 gene with primers XCE2+/XCE2−. The partial nucleotide sequence of this isolate showed 100% homology with the IBV GI-13 lineage, specifically with a field isolate of the 4/91 variant 1 Israel and the 4/91 vaccine on the hypervariable region 3 site of the S1 gene. CONCLUSION: An IB-like avian coronavirus was isolated from healthy Eclectus parrots. Our results indicate that IBV has a wide range of hosts, which prompt the need to understand the interspecies connection of this virus better.","Suryaman, G. K.; Soejoedono, R.

Patients did not benefit from CT angiography for various reasons: a contraindication, unavailability of the CT angiography, or a low clinical probability for pulmonary embolism. METHODS: We retrospectively describe the results of the V/Q SPECT/CT of five patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia in the nuclear medicine departments of the Centre Cardiologique du Nord and of the Delafontaine hospital in Saint-Denis (Ile-de-France, France) between April 2, 2020, and April 10, 2020. These patients had persistent dyspnea or chest pain suggesting pulmonary embolism. RESULTS: The V/Q SPECT/CT allowed to diagnose a pulmonary embolism in one of these five patients. We also noted several characteristics of the perfusion and ventilation depending on the lung lesions on the CT scan. The areas affected by COVID-19 were most often responsible for ventilatory anomalies with a relatively preserved perfusion. In more advanced cases of pneumonia, with alveolar fillings, the perfusion was also reduced or absent in accordance with large ventilation defects. In addition, the healthy parenchyma appeared to benefit from an uptake in ventilation and perfusion. CONCLUSION: V/Q SPECT/CT can play a role in the management of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 for the diagnosis of embolic complications with meticulous hygienic precautions. The different characteristics of the ventilatory and perfusion anomalies related to COVID-19 pneumonia will be confirmed with the next cases. In addition, in this pandemic context and facing a significant infectious risk, the utility of ventilation will also have to be specified.","Cobes, Nina; Guernou, Mohamed; Lussato, David; Queneau, Mathieu; Songy, Bernard; Bonardel, Gérald; Grellier, Jean-François",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,86,27

The present article dealt with scenarios of air quality concentration of air pollutants, and effect on climatic variability during the COVID-19 lockdown period in Kolkata Metropolitan Area, India. The result showed that the air pollutants are significantly reduced and the air quality index (AQI) was improved during the lockdown months. Aerosol concentrations decreased by − 54.94% from the period of pre-lockdown. The major air pollutants like particulate matters (PM(2.5), PM(10)), sulphur dioxide (SO(2)), carbon monoxide (CO) and Ozone (O(3)) were observed the maximum reduction ( − 40 to − 60%) in the COVID-19 lockdown period.

To simulate how the number of COVID-19 cases increases versus time, various data sets for the number of new cases and different mathematical models can be used. Since there are some differences in statistical data, the results of simulations can be different. Complex mathematical models contain many unknown parameters, the values of which must be determined using a limited number of observations of the disease over time. Even long-term monitoring of the epidemic may not provide reliable estimates of its parameters due to the constant change of testing conditions, isolation of infected and quarantine. Therefore, simpler approaches are necessary. In particular, previous simulations of the COVID-19 epidemic dynamics in Ukraine were based on smoothing of the dependence of the number of cases on time and the generalized SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model. These approaches allowed to detect the waves of pandemic and to make adequate predictions of the their duration and final sizes. In particular, eight waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine were investigated. Objective. We will compare the results simulation of a new epidemic wave in Ukraine based on national statistics and data reported by Johns Hopkins University (JHU). Methods. In this study we use the smoothing method for the dependences of the number of cases on time, the generalized SIR model for the dynamics of any epidemic wave, the exact solution of the linear differential equations, and statistical approach developed before. Results. Ninth epidemic wave in Ukraine was simulated. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were calculated and compared with the use of two data sets. Both predictions are not very optimistic: new cases will not stop appearing until June-July 2021. Conclusions. New waves of COVID-19 pandemic can be detected, calculated and predicted with the use of rather simple mathematical models. The results of calculations depend on the data sets for the number of confirmed cases. The expected long duration of the pandemic forces us to be careful and in solidarity. The government and all Ukrainians must strictly adhere to quarantine measures in order to avoid fatal consequences. Probably the presented results could be useful in order to estimate the efficiency of future vaccinations.","Nesteruk, I.",,86,26

Many existing works on fake news detection utilized spreading information like propagatorsâô profiles and the propagation structure. However, such methods face the difficulty of data collection and cannot detect fake news at the early stage. An alternative approach is to detect fake news solely based on its content. Early content-based methods rely on manually designed linguistic features. Such shallow features are domain-dependent, and cannot easily be generalized to cross-domain data. Recently, many natural language processing tasks resort to deep learning methods to learn word, sentence, and document representations. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based neural network model named SemSeq4FD for early fake news detection based on enhanced text representations. In SemSeq4FD, we model the global pair-wise semantic relations between sentences as a complete graph, and learn the global sentence representations via a graph convolutional network with self-attention mechanism. Considering the importance of local context in conveying the sentence meaning, we employ a 1D convolutional network to learn the local sentence representations. The two representations are combined to form the enhanced sentence representations. Then a LSTM-based network is used to model the sequence of enhanced sentence representations, yielding the final document representation for fake news detection. Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets in English and Chinese, including cross-source and cross-domain datasets, demonstrate that our model can outperform the state-of-the-art methods.","Wang, Yuhang; Wang, Li; Yang, Yanjie; Lian, Tao",Expert Syst Appl,86,16

METHODS: Retrospective study collecting demographic and clinical characteristics of patients admitted at Southend University Hospital from 20th February to 7th May 2020. RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort admitted to hospital with Covid-19 was 69.4 and 58% were over 70. Comorbidities were more frequently observed in non-survivors, whose mean Clinical Frailty Scale was significantly higher (5 vs 3) than survivors, p < 0.001. In addition, mean C-reactive protein was significantly higher. CONCLUSION: Older and frailer patients with high inflammatory markers were at risk of poor outcomes. Integrated frailty and age-based risk stratification is essential, in addition to monitoring saturation /FiO2 ratio (SFR) and inflammatory markers throughout the disease course to allow for early intervention to improve patient outcomes.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study at eight clinical sites and pharmacies in California and Washington State from July 2018 to March 2020. Pharmacists at participating pharmacies underwent a 1-hour training on medication abortion. We approached patients who had already been evaluated, counseled, and consented for medication abortion per standard of care. Patients interested in study participation gave consent, and the clinician electronically sent a prescription to the pharmacy for mifepristone 200 mg orally, followed 24–48 hours later by misoprostol 800 micrograms buccally. Participants were sent web-based surveys about their experience and outcomes on days 2 and 14 after enrollment and had routine follow-up with study sites. We extracted demographic and clinical data, including abortion outcome and adverse events, from medical records. We performed multivariable logistic regression to assess the association of pharmacy experience and other covariates with satisfaction. RESULTS: We enrolled 266 participants and obtained clinical outcome information for 262 (98.5%), of whom two reported not taking either medication. Of the 260 participants with abortion outcome information, 252 (96.9%) and 237 (91.2%) completed day 2 and 14 surveys, respectively. Complete medication abortion (primary outcome) occurred for 243 participants (93.5%, 95% CI 89.7–96.1%). Four participants (1.5%, 95% CI 0.4–3.9%) had an adverse event, none of which was serious or related to pharmacist dispensing. In the day 2 survey, 91.3% (95% CI 87.1–94.4%) of participants reported satisfaction with the pharmacy experience. In the day 14 survey, 84.4% (95% CI 79.1–88.8%) reported satisfaction with the medication abortion experience. Those reporting being very satisfied with the pharmacy experience had higher odds of reporting overall satisfaction with medication abortion (adjusted odds ratio 2.96, 95% CI 1.38–6.32). CONCLUSION: Pharmacist dispensing of mifepristone for medication abortion is effective and acceptable to patients, with a low prevalence of adverse events.

Drawing from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this report examined the characteristics of telemental health providers and how the acceptability of telemedicine features contributes to their intention to use the technology more often in practice. Telemental health providers (N = 177) completed an online survey between March and May 2019. Most providers (75%) spent less than 25% of their work-week using telemedicine, but 70% reported an intention to use telemedicine more in the future. The belief that telemedicine affords greater access to patients, work-life balance, flexibility in providing care, and the opportunity to be at the forefront of innovative care were significant predictors of intentions to use the technology more in the future. Other significant predictors included needing assistance to coordinate insurance reimbursements, manage a successful telemedicine practice, and integrate the telemedicine program with other health IT software. Findings have important implications for increasing the frequency of telemedicine use among telemental health providers. Future research and practice should leverage providers’ positive beliefs about telemedicine acceptability and consider their needs to enhance its uptake.","Bunnell, Brian E.; Barrera, Janelle F.; Paige, Samantha R.; Turner, Dylan; Welch, Brandon M.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,86,20

Opportunistic infectious agents that cause diarrhea in patients with HIV span the array of protozoa, fungi, viruses, and bacteria. With global use of ART, the incidence of diarrhea because of opportunistic infections has decreased; however, the incidence of noninfectious diarrhea has increased. The etiology of noninfectious diarrhea in patients with HIV is multifactorial and includes ART-associated diarrhea and gastrointestinal damage related to HIV infection (i.e., HIV enteropathy). A basic algorithm for the diagnosis of diarrhea in patients with HIV includes physical examination, a review of medical history, assessment of HIV viral load and CD4+ T cell count, stool microbiologic assessment, and endoscopic evaluation, if needed. For patients with negative diagnostic results, the diagnosis of noninfectious diarrhea may be considered. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of noninfectious diarrhea are primarily supportive; however, the use of many unapproved agents is based on unstudied and anecdotal information. In addition, these agents can be associated with treatment-limiting adverse events (AEs), such as drug–drug interactions with ART regimens, abuse liability, and additional gastrointestinal AEs. Currently, crofelemer, an antisecretory agent, is the only therapy approved in the USA for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in patients with HIV on ART.","Dikman, Andrew E.; Schonfeld, Emily; Srisarajivakul, Nalinee C.; Poles, Michael A.",Dig Dis Sci,86,28

All 22 N-glycan sites of SARS-CoV-2 Spike remain highly conserved among the variants B.1.1.7, 501Y.V2 and P.1, opening an avenue for robust therapeutic intervention. Here we used a comprehensive library of mammalian carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) to probe critical sugar residues on the full-length trimeric Spike and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Two lectins, Clec4g and CD209c, were identified to strongly bind to Spike. Clec4g and CD209c binding to Spike was dissected and visualized in real time and at single molecule resolution using atomic force microscopy. 3D modelling showed that both lectins can bind to a glycan within the RBD-ACE2 interface and thus interferes with Spike binding to cell surfaces. Importantly, Clec4g and CD209c significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 infections. These data report the first extensive map and 3D structural modelling of lectin-Spike interactions and uncovers candidate receptors involved in Spike binding and SARS-CoV-2 infections. The capacity of CLEC4G and mCD209c lectins to block SARS-CoV-2 viral entry holds promise for pan-variant therapeutic interventions.","Hoffmann, David; Mereiter, Stefan; Oh, Yoo Jin; Monteil, Vanessa; Zhu, Rong; Canena, Daniel; Hain, Lisa; Laurent, Elisabeth; Grünwald-Gruber, Clemens; Novatchkova, Maria; Ticevic, Melita; Chabloz, Antoine; Wirnsberger, Gerald; Hagelkruys, Astrid; Altmann, Friedrich; Mach, Lukas; Stadlmann, Johannes; Oostenbrink, Chris; Mirazimi, Ali; Hinterdorfer, Peter; Penninger, Josef M.",bioRxiv,86,16

The immune system has emerged as a key determinant in shaping the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is mainly the deleterious unconstrained immune response, rather than the virus itself, which leads to severe cases of COVID-19 and the associated mortality. Genetic susceptibility to dysregulated immune response is highly likely to be among the host factors for adverse disease outcome. Given that such genetic susceptibility has also been observed in autoimmune diseases (ADs), a number of critical questions remain unanswered; whether individuals with ADs have a significantly different risk for COVID-19–related complications compared to the general population, and whether studies on the genetics of ADs can shed some light on the host factors in COVID-19. In this perspective, we discuss the host genetic factors, which have been under investigation in association with COVID-19 severity. We touch upon the intricate link between autoimmunity and COVID-19 pathophysiology. We put forth a number of autoimmune susceptibility genes, which have the potential to be additional host genetic factors for modifying the severity of COVID-19 presentation. In summary, host genetics at the intersection of ADs and COVID-19 may serve as a source for understanding the heterogeneity of COVID-19 severity, and hence, potentially holds a key in achieving effective strategies in risk group identification, as well as effective treatments.","Karaderi, Tugce; Bareke, Halin; Kunter, Imge; Seytanoglu, Adil; Cagnan, Ilgin; Balci, Deniz; Barin, Burc; Hocaoglu, Mevhibe B.; Rahmioglu, Nilufer; Asilmaz, Esra; Taneri, Bahar",Front Immunol,86,5

The S1 subunit of the spike is assumed to be required for virus attachment. However, we have previously shown that this domain of the embryo- and cell culture adapted Beaudette strain, in contrast to that of the virulent M41 strain, is not sufficient for binding to chicken trachea (Wickramasinghe et al., 2011). In the present study, we demonstrated that the lack of binding of Beaudette S1 was not due to absence of virus receptors on this tissue nor due to the production of S1 from mammalian cells, as S1 proteins expressed from chicken cells also lacked the ability to bind IBV-susceptible embryonic tissue. Subsequently, we addressed the contribution of the S2 subunit of the spike in IBV attachment. Recombinant IBV Beaudette spike ectodomains, comprising the entire S1 domain and the S2 ectodomain, were expressed and analyzed for binding to susceptible embryonic chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) in our previously developed spike histochemistry assay. We observed that extension of the S1 domain with the S2 subunit of the Beaudette spike was sufficient to gain binding to CAM. A previously suggested heparin sulfate binding site in Beaudette S2 was not required for the observed binding to CAM, while sialic acids on the host tissues were essential for the attachment. To further elucidate the role of S2 the spike ectodomains of virulent IBV M41 and chimeras of M41 and Beaudette were analyzed for their binding to CAM, chicken trachea and mammalian cell lines. While the M41 spike ectodomain showed increased attachment to both CAM and chicken trachea, no binding to mammalian cells was observed. In contrast, Beaudette spike ectodomain had relatively weak ability to bind to chicken trachea, but displayed marked extended host range to mammalian cells. Binding patterns of chimeric spike ectodomains to these tissues and cells indicate that S2 subunits most likely do not contain an additional independent receptor-binding site. Rather, the interplay between S1 and S2 subunits of spikes from the same viral origin might finally determine the avidity and specificity of virus attachment and thus viral host range.","Promkuntod, N.; Wickramasinghe, I.N.

DESIGN: Prospective Randomised Interventional Study. SETTING: Renal Transplant Department in a tertiary centre in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 200 Renal transplant patients aged between 20 and 88 years. Telephone interviews were undertaken between 1(st) May, 2020 and 29(th) May, 2020, at the height of ‘shielding’ from COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised into 2 groups, with 1 group receiving a simple ‘priming question’ regarding the COVID pandemic and the other group having no prior contact. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Individuals were then asked to rate their own overall lifetime happiness; desire to change; overall life satisfaction and momentary happiness on a scale of 1 to 10 for each measure. Independent sample t-tests were used to compare results between the two groups, with a type 1 error rate below 5% considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Participants’ overall happiness with their life as a whole revealed that individuals who were primed with a question about COVID-19 reported increased overall happiness with their life compared to individuals who had not been primed (+0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.42 to 1.35, p = 0.0002). In addition, participants in the primed group reported less desire to change their life when compared to the non-primed group (-1.35, 95% confidence interval -2.06 to -0.65, p = 0.0002). Participants who were primed with the COVID-19 question also reported a higher overall satisfaction with their life than individuals who had not been primed (+1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 1.52, p = 0.0001). Finally, the participants who received the priming question demonstrated increased reported momentary happiness (+0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 1.24, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that bringing salience to the COVID-19 pandemic with a simple question leads to positive changes in both momentary happiness and other components of global life satisfaction, thereby extrapolating evidence for the application of the mood-as-information theory to more extreme life circumstances. Given the importance of patient-reported evaluations, these findings have implications for how, when and where accurate and reproducible measurements of life satisfaction should be obtained.","O’Donnell, Alice; Wilson, Lydia; Bosch, Jos A.; Borrows, Richard",PLoS One,86,30

ABSTRACT: The global HIV epidemic continues to grow, with 1.8 million new infections occurring per year. In the absence of a cure and an AIDS vaccine, there is a pressing need to prevent new infections in order to curb the disease. Topical microbicides that block viral entry into human cells can potentially prevent HIV infection. The antiviral lectin griffithsin has been identified as a highly potent inhibitor of HIV entry into human cells. Here we have explored the possibility to use transplastomic plants as an inexpensive production platform for griffithsin. We show that griffithsin accumulates in stably transformed tobacco chloroplasts to up to 5% of the total soluble protein of the plant. Griffithsin can be easily purified from leaf material and shows similarly high virus neutralization activity as griffithsin protein recombinantly expressed in bacteria. We also show that dried tobacco provides a storable source material for griffithsin purification, thus enabling quick scale-up of production on demand.

Mexico was not included in the first-ever report on a global cohort of patients with this coinfection. We report on a case of SARS-CoV-2/MBT coinfection in a 51-year-old taxi driver from Mexico City that underscores the importance of rapid and accurate laboratory testing, diagnosis, and treatment. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a man in the sixth decade of life who was admitted to the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER) with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, which was confirmed by nasopharyngeal exudate using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the identification of SARS-CoV-2. Findings from imaging studies suggested that the patient might be coinfected with MBT. That suspicion was confirmed with light microscopy of a sputum sample after Ziehl-Neelsen staining and when a Cepheid Xpert MTB/RIF assay, an automated semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay, failed to detect rifampicin resistance. The patient was discharged from the hospital 10 days later. CONCLUSIONS: The present report underscores the importance of using validated molecular diagnostic tests to identify coin-fections in areas where there is a high prevalence of other causes of pneumonia, such as MBT, as a way to improve clinical outcomes in patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While it is imperative to control the COVID-19 pandemic, the medical community must not forget about the other pandemics to which populations are still prey, and tuberculosis is one of them.

Even considering the main causes of death, such as neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases, external causes, respiratory diseases, and infectious diseases, there are still important debate regarding the spatial pattern of mortality by causes in Brazil. Evidence shows that there is an overlap in transitional health states, due to the persistence of infectious diseases (e.g., dengue, cholera, malaria, etc.,) in parallel with the increase in chronic degenerative diseases. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the spatio-temporal evolution of three groups of causes of death in Brazil across small areas from 1998 to 2017, by sex. Methods: We use publicly available data from the System Data Mortality Information (SIM-DATASUS) from 1998 to 2017. We focus on this period due to the better quality of information, in addition to all deaths are registered following the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). We estimate standardized mortality rates by sex and cause aggregated into three main groups. We use a ternary color scheme to maximize all the information in a three-dimensional array of compositional data. Results: We find improvements in mortality from chronic degenerative diseases; faster declines are observed in the Southern regions of the country; but the persistence of high levels of mortality due to infectious diseases remained in the northern parts of the country. We also find impressive differences in external causes of deaths between males and females and an increase in mortality from these causes in the interior part of the country. Conclusions: This study provides useful information for policy makers in establishing effective measures for the prevention of deaths and public health planning for deaths from external and non-communicable causes. We observed how the distribution of causes of death varies across regions and how the patterns of mortality also vary by gender.","Baptista, Emerson Augusto; Queiroz, Bernardo Lanza; Pinheiro, Pedro Cisalpino",Front Public Health,86,1

Similar to other class 1 viral fusion proteins, the heptad repeat regions of SARS-CoV spike are thought to undergo conformational changes from a prefusion form to a subsequent post-fusion form that enables fusion of the viral and host membranes. Recently, the structure of a post-fusion form of SARS-CoV spike, which consists of isolated domains of heptad repeats 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2), has been determined by x-ray crystallography. To date there is no structural information for the prefusion conformations of SARS-CoV HR1 and HR2. In this work we present the NMR structure of the HR2 domain (residues 1141-1193) from SARS-CoV (termed S2-HR2) in the presence of the co-solvent trifluoroethanol. We find that in the absence of HR1, S2-HR2 forms a coiled coil symmetric trimer with a complex molecular mass of 18 kDa. The S2-HR2 structure, which is the first example of the prefusion form of coronavirus envelope, supports the current model of viral membrane fusion and gives insight into the design of structure-based antagonists of SARS.","Hakansson-McReynolds, Susanna; Jiang, Shaokai; Rong, Lijun; Caffrey, Michael",J Biol Chem,86,27

To compile a comprehensive collection of views of the future, supplemental and ad hoc searches were also performed. After screening all search records against a set of predetermined criteria, the review yielded 36 references (17 peer-reviewed, 4 gray, and 15 supplemental) containing scenarios. In these, the future of work was described along multiple conceptual axes (e.g. labor market changes, societal values, and manual versus cognitive work). Technology was identified as the primary driver of the future of work in most scenarios, and there were divergent views in the literature as to whether technology will create more or fewer jobs than it displaces. Workforce demographics, globalization, climate change, economic conditions, and urbanization were also mentioned as influential factors. Other important themes included human enhancement, social isolation, loneliness, worker monitoring, advanced manufacturing, hazardous exposures, sustainability, biotechnology, and synthetic biology. Pandemics have not been widely considered in the future of work literature, but the recent COVID-19 pandemic illustrates that was short-sighted. Pandemics may accelerate future of work trends and merit critical consideration in scenario development. Many scenarios described ‘new’ or ‘exacerbated’ psychosocial hazards of work, whereas comparatively fewer discussed physical, chemical, or biological hazards. Various preventive recommendations were identified. In particular, reducing stress associated with precarious work and its requirements of continual skill preparation and training was acknowledged as critical for protecting and promoting the health and well-being of the future workforce. In conclusion, the future of work will be comprised of diverse complex scenarios and a mosaic of old and new hazards. These findings may serve as the basis for considering how to shape the future of work.","Schulte, Paul A; Streit, Jessica M K; Sheriff, Fatima; Delclos, George; Felknor, Sarah A; Tamers, Sara L; Fendinger, Sherry; Grosch, James; Sala, Robert",Ann Work Expo Health,86,27

Data about AKI in intensive care unit (ICU) patients in Latin America are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the risk of AKI, dialysis (HD), and death in ICU COVID-19 patients in a Brazilian center. Methods: Analysis from medical records of COVID-19 patients in a Brazilian center. Results: A total of 95 patients were analyzed. There was male predominance (64.2%), median age: 64.9 years, and previous history of hypertension and diabetes in 51.6 and 27.4%, respectively. AKI was diagnosed in 54 (56.8%) patients, and 32 (59.2%) of them required HD. Mortality rate was 17.9%. AKI patients when compared with no-AKI were more frequently hypertensive/diabetic and more often needed organ support therapies. Workups depicted more anemia, lymphopenia, and higher levels of inflammatory markers and higher mortality. Comparing patients who had undergone death to survivors, they were older, more frequently diabetic, and had worse SAPS3 and SOFA scores and need for organ support therapies, AKI, and HD. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that hypertension (p = 0.018) and mechanical ventilation (p = 0.002) were associated with AKI; hypertension (p = 0.002), mechanical ventilation (p = 0.008), and use of vasopressor (p = 0.027) to HD patients; and age >65 years (p = 0.03) and AKI (p = 0.04) were risk factors for death. Conclusions: AKI was a common complication of ICU COVID-19 patients, and it was more frequent in patients with hypertension and need of organ support therapies. As well as age >65 years, AKI was an independent risk factor for death.","Neves, Precil Diego Miranda de Menezes; Sato, Victor Augusto Hamamoto; Mohrbacher, Sara; Ferreira, Bernadete Maria Coelho; Oliveira, Érico Souza; Pereira, Leonardo Victor Barbosa; Bales, Alessandra Martins; Nardotto, Luciana Loureiro; Ferreira, Jéssica Nogueira; Machado, David José; Bassi, Estêvão; Silva-Júnior, Amilton; Chocair, Pedro Renato; Cuvello-Neto, Américo Lourenço",Front Med (Lausanne),86,1

We investigated care homes reporting a single suspected or confirmed case to assess whether early mass testing might reduce risk of transmission during the peak of the pandemic in London. Methods: Between 18–27 April 2020, residents and staff in care homes reporting a single case of COVID-19 to Public Health England had a nasal swab to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR and subsequent whole genome sequencing. Residents and staff in two care homes were re-tested eight days later. Results: Four care homes were investigated. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 20% (65/333) overall, ranging between 3–59%. Among residents, positivity ranged between 3–76% compared to 3–40% in staff. Half of the SARS-CoV-2 positive residents (23/46, 50%) and 63% of staff (12/19) reported symptoms within 14 days before or after testing. Repeat testing 8 days later in two care homes with the highest infection rates identified only two new cases. Genomic analysis demonstrated a small number of introductions of the virus into care homes, and distinct clusters within three of the care homes. Conclusions: We found extensive but variable rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection among residents and staff in care homes reporting a single case of COVID-19. While routine whole home testing has now been adopted into practice, care homes must remain vigilant and should be encouraged to report a single suspected case, which should trigger appropriate outbreak control measures.","Tang, Suzanne; Perez, Marina Sanchez; Saavedra-Campos, Maria; Paranthaman, Karthik; Myers, Richard; Fok, Jonathan; Crawley-Boevey, Emma; Dun-Campbell, Kate; Janarthanan, Roshni; Fernandez, Elena; Vusirikala, Amoolya; Patel, Bharat; Ma, Thomas; Amin-Chowdhury, Zahin; Shetty, Nandini; Zambon, Maria; Bell, Anita; Wynne-Evans, Edward; Chow, Yimmy; Ladhani, Shamez",Age Ageing,86,26

Thus, 1,404 participants (977 women, 426 men, and one respondent preferred not to answer) ranging from 18 to 89 years old (36.4 ± 11.7 year-old) completed a questionnaire in the period between 1st and 15th April 2021. The survey included sociodemographic data and the following validated instruments: the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), the Basic Need General Satisfaction Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to examine variation in anxiety levels and BPN satisfaction according to PA category (low, moderate, and high). Spearman’s Rho correlations coefficients were used to determine the association between anxiety levels and psychological needs. Individuals presenting a higher level of PA revealed lower levels of anxiety-state (H = 20.14; p < 0.01). Differences between elements from different levels of PA were found for the autonomy (H = 23.52; p < 0.001), competence (H = 18.89; p < 0.001), and relatedness (H = 24.42; p < 0.001) psychological needs, suggesting that those who feel their BPN as more satisfied have higher levels of PA. The study found statistically significant correlations between anxiety-state and the satisfaction of the needs for autonomy (p = 0.01; r = −0.46), competence (p = 0.01; r = −0.40), and relatedness (p = 0.01; r = −0.21). These findings support the importance that PA has in the anxiety levels during social isolation, emphasizing the importance of multidisciplinary teams in an individual-based approach.","Antunes, Raul; Rebelo-Gonçalves, Ricardo; Amaro, Nuno; Salvador, Rogério; Matos, Rui; Morouço, Pedro; Frontini, Roberta",Front Psychol,86,1

We studied the occurrence and impact of PeV-A over 10 years. METHODS: Children from Sør-Trøndelag County, Norway, hospitalized with RTI and a comparison group of asymptomatic children admitted to elective surgery, were prospectively enrolled from 2006 to 2016. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were cultured and analyzed with polymerase chain reaction tests for PeV-A and 19 other pathogens. The cycle threshold levels of PeV-A were reported as measures of viral genomic loads. Parechovirus A-positive samples were genotyped by amplification and sequencing of the VP3/VP1 junction. RESULTS: Parechovirus A was detected in 8.8% (323/3689) patients with RTI and in 10.1% (45/444) of the children in the comparison group (P = .34). Parechovirus A genotyping (n = 188) revealed PeV-A1 (n = 121), PeV-A3 (n = 15), PeV-A5 (n = 6), and PeV-A6 (n = 46). Viral codetections occurred in 95% of patients and in 84% of the children in the comparison group (P = .016). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, RTI was unrelated to PeV-A genomic loads, adjusted for other viruses and covariates. Similar results were found for PeV-A1 and PeV-A6. CONCLUSIONS: Parechovirus A and viral codetections were common in hospitalized children with RTI and asymptomatic children in a comparison group. Our findings suggest that PeV-A has a limited role in hospitalized children with RTI.","Skanke, Lars Høsøien; Lysvand, Hilde; Heimdal, Inger; Moe, Nina; Krokstad, Sidsel; Christensen, Andreas; Risnes, Kari; Nordbø, Svein Arne; Døllner, Henrik",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,86,16

People with co-morbidities like obesity, diabetes and hypertension are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 illness. This is of overwhelming concern because 42% of Americans are obese, 30% are pre-diabetic and 9.4% have clinical diabetes. Here, we investigated the effect of obesity on disease severity following SARS-CoV-2 infection using a well-established mouse model of diet-induced obesity. Diet-induced obese and lean control C57BL/6N mice, transduced for ACE2 expression using replication-defective adenovirus, were infected with SARS-CoV-2, and monitored for lung pathology, viral titers, and cytokine expression. No significant differences in tissue pathology, viral replication or cytokine expression were observed between lean and obese groups. Notably, significant weight loss was observed in obese mice treated with the adenovirus vector, independent of SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting an obesity-dependent morbidity induced by the vector. These data indicate that the adenovirus-transduced mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection is inadequate for performing nutrition studies, and caution should be used when interpreting resulting data.","Rai, Pallavi; Chuong, Christina; LeRoith, Tanya; Smyth, James W; Panov, Julia; Levi, Moshe; Kehn-Hall, Kylene; Duggal, Nisha K.; Lucarelli, James-Weger",bioRxiv,86,3

LIGHT (homologous to lymphotoxins, exhibiting inducible expression and competing with herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D for herpes virus entry mediator [HVEM]), a receptor expressed by T lymphocytes, has recently emerged as a new regulator of connective tissue remodeling and fibrotic response. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of LIGHT in the pathogenesis of LDO through: (1) assessment of expression of LIGHT and its two receptors, HVEM and LTβR (lymphotoxin β receptor), and (2) investigation of potential relationships between expression of LIGHT and its receptors and clinical and histopathologic features. METHODS: Lacrimal sacs of 30 patients undergoing endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy because of LDO were assessed intraoperatively and histopathologically with respect to inflammation and fibrosis. Expression of LIGHT, HVEM and LTβR was assessed by immunohistochemistry using specific antibodies and evaluated semiquantitatively using a four-grade scoring system. RESULTS: All investigated molecules, LIGHT/TNFSF14, HVEM and LTβR, were expressed in biopsies from all patients. The most prominent expression was seen within inflammatory infiltrates. Expression of LIGH, HVEM and LTβR correlated significantly with the intensity of fibrosis and duration of the disease. In multivariate analysis only LIGHT showed a significant relationship with fibrosis (β coefficient = 0.759, p = 0.02). There was no significant correlation between expression of any molecule and other demographic or clinical features. CONCLUSION: We assume that LIGHT along with its receptors may be a factor contributing to fibrosis and synechiae formation in the lacrimal sac. This assumption needs to be proven in a future study in a group of patients who fail to improve after the first operation.","Bielecki, Pawel; Gindzienska-Sieskiewicz, Ewa; Reszeć, Joanna; Piszczatowski, Bartosz; Rogowski, Marek; Kowal-Bielecka, Otylia; Kowal, Krzysztof; Sieskiewicz, Andrzej",Ophthalmol Ther,86,16

This paper is the first to outline the priority changes of both SD and CSR over the period of COVID-19 incidence in China. An online questionnaire survey of 1161 owners and managers of Chinese companies was conducted, and respondents were asked to score the priorities of their company over the pre, during and post COVID-19 periods. The research was carried out at the end of the first COVID-19 wave in China but during the period of lockdown in some parts of the country. It was found that there was a priority change regarding three dimensions of sustainable development and 13 aspects of CSR. While the social dimension of SD was prioritized during and post COVID-19, the environmental dimension was the only one deemed to be less important and less prioritized over the longer term after the pandemic. The top three short-term CSR priorities were having in place a workplace health and safety plan, engaging in philanthropic activities and protecting biodiversity, and the top three longer-term CSR priorities were job creation, protecting biodiversity and having in place a workplace health and safety plan. Environmental protection and using clean energy were not reported as a CSR priority.

Assessing the overall pattern in population health as a country implements and relaxes a lockdown is relevant, as these patterns may not necessarily be symmetric. We aimed to estimate the changing trends in cause-specific mortality in relation to the 2020 COVID-19 related lockdowns in Peru. Methods: Based on data from the Peruvian National Death Information System (SINADEF), we calculated death rates per 10 million population to assess the trends in mortality rates for non-external and external causes of death (suicides, traffic accidents, and homicides). We compared these trends to 2018-2019, before, during, and after the lockdown, stratified by sex, and adjusted by Peruvian macro-region (Lima & Callao (capital region), Coast, Highland, and Jungle). Results: Non-external deaths presented a distinctive pattern among macro-regions, with an early surge in the Jungle and a later increase in the Highland. External deaths dropped during the lockdown, however, suicides and homicides returned to previous levels in the post-lockdown period. Deaths due to traffic accidents dropped during the lockdown and returned to pre-pandemic levels by December 2020. Conclusions: We found a sudden drop in external causes of death, with suicides and homicides returning to previous levels after the lifting of the lockdown. Non-external deaths showed a differential pattern by macro-region. A close monitoring of these trends could help identify early spikes among these causes of death and take action to prevent a further increase in mortality indirectly affected by the pandemic.","Calderon-Anyosa, Renzo J.C.; Bilal, Usama; Kaufman, Jay S.",Yale J Biol Med,86,10

People with close contact with animals are at high risk for contracting and transmitting the zoonotic diseases. OBJECTIVES: To determine health literacy of livestock farmers toward biosecurity to prevent zoonotic diseases. METHODS: This cross-sectional mixed-methods study was conducted in Thai Nguyen Province, Vietnam, where livestock and farming are the main occupation. The questionnaire survey was submitted to 218 farmers who have close contact with livestock. In addition, 8 farmers were invited to an in-depth interview to further explore the health literacy. RESULTS: Half of the participants were men. The average age (standard deviation) of the participants was 49.3(11.5) years. The median years with experience in farming was 15 years. The majority (82.0%) of the participants had moderate health literacy level regarding zoonoses. Improper use of antibiotics was referred by 58.0% of participants, including antibiotic use as feeding supplements (34.0%) and the use of human antibiotics to treat sick animals (24.0%). Many participants were unaware of zoonotic prevention measures and due to this had practices such as not wearing protective equipment (60.0%), an absence of acaricides to prevent vector infestations (52.0%), an absence of disinfection measures (42.0%), low rate of rabies vaccination (54.0%), and do not quarantining sick animals (38.0%). In-depth interviews revealed great concern among farmers about a collective lack of participation from local veterinarians, health workers, and government authorities in zoonoses-prevention efforts. Statistical models showed that farm scale, ethnic groups, and perceived income were associated with the overall health literacy about zoonoses. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive health education related to zoonotic diseases is recommended to improve overall knowledge, including routes of transmission, symptoms and consequences of diseases, and antibiotic usage. In addition, guidance should be provided to farmers on how to treat sick animals, the appropriate use of antibiotics, and waste management. Local veterinarians and health workers are important contact points and should work closely with the farmers to prevent zoonotic diseases.","Cao Ba, Khuong; Kaewkungwal, Jaranit; Pacheun, Oranut; Nguyen Thi To, Uyen; Lawpoolsri, Saranath",Environ Health Insights,86,22

However, not all of this damage is attributable to the disease itself; much of it has occurred due to the prevailing misinformation around COVID-19. This rapid integrative review will draw on knowledge from the literature about misinformation during previous abrupt large-scale infectious disease outbreaks to enable policymakers, governments and health institutions to proactively mitigate the spread and effect of misinformation. SUBJECT AND METHODS: For this rapid integrative review, we systematically searched MEDLINE and Google Scholar and extracted the literature on misinformation during abrupt large-scale infectious disease outbreaks since 2000. We screened articles using predetermined inclusion criteria. We followed an updated methodology for integrated reviews and adjusted it for our rapid review approach. RESULTS: We found widespread misinformation in all aspects of large-scale infectious disease outbreaks since 2000, including prevention, treatment, risk factor, transmission mode, complications and vaccines. Conspiracy theories also prevailed, particularly involving vaccines. Misinformation most frequently has been reported regarding Ebola, and women and youth are particularly vulnerable to misinformation. A lack of scientific knowledge by individuals and a lack of trust in the government increased the consumption of misinformation, which is disseminated quickly by the unregulated media, particularly social media. CONCLUSION: This review identified the nature and pattern of misinformation during large-scale infectious disease outbreaks, which could potentially be used to address misinformation during the ongoing COVID-19 or any future pandemic.","Chowdhury, Nashit; Khalid, Ayisha; Turin, Tanvir C.",Z Gesundh Wiss,86,22

In particular, it has had a strong impact on college students, including international students. Through an online questionnaire survey, it is found that the psychological distress experienced by international students is the result of a combination of the external environment (including the lockdown measures, social distancing, and social support) and internal factors such as values and behavior. The analysis shows that the new teaching mode and the corresponding changes in learning behavior are significantly associated with the psychological distress brought about by the COVID-19 epidemic. In addition, the influence of international students’ values also plays a significant role in their psychological distress. Collective values are conducive to the alleviation of psychological distress, while individual values have the opposite effect. At the same time, the study also reveals that if there is sufficient social support, isolation (due to lockdown or social distancing early or later on) is not necessarily directly related to psychological distress. However, only formal social support can effectively alleviate psychological distress, while informal social support does not play a similar role.

Several case studies have reported sudden sensorineural hearing loss post-coronavirus disease and its detrimental impact on overall hearing. As both sudden sensorineural hearing loss and coronavirus disease deals with an emergency situation, there is a need to document case studies on how these individuals have been assessed and treated. The article has systematically reviewed these case reports involving a search strategy in databases like PubMed, PubMed Central, science direct, J-GATE, Google Scholar, and a manual Google Search.","Umashankar, Abishek; Prakash, Praveen; Prabhu, Prashanth",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,86,22

The present prospective randomized crossover study aimed to assess the changes in driving pressure in response to variations in the level of assistance delivered by PSV vs NAVA. METHODS: 16 intubated adult patients, recovering from hypoxemic acute respiratory failure (ARF) and undergoing assisted ventilation, were randomly subjected to six 30-min-lasting trials. At baseline, PSV (PSV100) was set with the same regulation present at patient enrollment. The corresponding level of NAVA (NAVA100) was set to match the same inspiratory peak of airway pressure obtained in PSV100. Therefore, the level of assistance was reduced and increased by 50% in both ventilatory modes (PSV50, NAVA50; PSV150, NAVA150). At the end of each trial, ﻿driving pressure obtained in response to four short (2–3 s) end-expiratory and end-inspiratory occlusions was analyzed. RESULTS: Driving pressure at PSV50 (6.6 [6.1–7.8] cmH(2)O) was lower than that recorded at PSV100 (7.9 [7.2–9.1] cmH(2)O, P = 0.005) and PSV150 (9.9 [9.1–13.2] cmH(2)O, P < 0.0001). In NAVA, driving pressure at NAVA50 was reduced compared to NAVA150 (7.7 [5.1–8.1] cmH(2)O vs 8.3 [6.4–11.4] cmH(2)O, P = 0.013), whereas there were no changes between baseline and NAVA150 (8.5 [6.3–9.8] cmH(2)O vs 8.3 [6.4–11.4] cmH(2)O, P = 0.331, respectively). Driving pressure at PSV150 was higher than that observed in NAVA150 (P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: NAVA delivers better lung-protective ventilation compared to PSV in hypoxemic ARF patients.

However, the effects of drug use on the immune system might also influence this phenomenon. Psychostimulants act on peripheral immune cells even before they reach the central nervous system (CNS) and their effects on immunity are likely to influence HIV infection. Beyond their canonical activities, classic neurotransmitters and neuromodulators are expressed by peripheral immune cells (e.g., dopamine and enkephalins), which display immunomodulatory properties and could be influenced by psychostimulants. Immune receptors, like Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on microglia, are modulated by cocaine and amphetamine exposure. Since peripheral immunocytes also express TLRs, they may be similarly affected by psychostimulants. In this review, we will summarize how psychostimulants are currently thought to influence peripheral immunity, mainly focusing on catecholamines, enkephalins and TLR4, and shed light on how these drugs might affect HIV infection. We will try to shift from the classic CNS perspective and adopt a more holistic view, addressing the potential impact of psychostimulants on the peripheral immune system and how their systemic effects could influence HIV infection.","Assis, María Amparo; Carranza, Pedro Gabriel; Ambrosio, Emilio",Viruses,86,26

These haplotypes were previously used for phylogenetic analysis, following the LaBECom protocols. All gaps and unconserved sites were extracted for the construction of a phylogenetic tree. As specific methodologies for paired FST estimators, Molecular Variance (AMOVA), Genetic Distance, mismatch, demographic and spatial expansion analyses, molecular diversity and evolutionary divergence time analyses, 20,000 random permutations were always used. The results revealed the presence of only 57 sites of polymorphic and parsimonium-informative among the 29,827bp analyzed and the analyses based on FST values confirmed the presence of two distinct genetic entities with fixation index of 22% and with a higher component of population variation (78.14%). Tau variations revealed a significant time of divergence, supported by mismatch analysis of the observed distribution (τ = 42%). It is safe to say that the small number of existing polymorphisms should not reflect major changes in the protein products of viral populations in both countries and this consideration provides the safety that, although there are differences in the haplotypes studied, these differences are minimal for both regions analyzed geographically and, therefore, it seems safe to extrapolate the levels of polymorphism and molecular diversity found in the samples for other mutant genomes of SARS-CoV-2 in other countries. This reduces speculation about the possibility of large differences between mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) and wild strains, at least at the level of their protein products, although the mutant form has higher transmission speed and infection. The analyses suggest that possible variations in protein products, of the wild virus in relation to its mutant form, should be minimal, bringing peace of mind as to the increased risk of death from the new form of the virus, as well as possible problems of gradual adjustments in some molecular targets for vaccines.","Felix, Pierre Teodósio; Venâncio, Dallynne Bárbara Ramos; Da Silva, Eduarda Doralice Alves Braz; da Silva Ramos, Robson",bioRxiv,86,8

METHODS: We developed a model to determine the number of N95 respirators needed for HCWs both in a single acute-care hospital and the United States. RESULTS: For an acute-care hospital with 400 all-cause monthly admissions, the number of N95 respirators needed to manage COVID-19 patients admitted during a month ranges from 113 (95% interpercentile range [IPR], 50–229) if 0.5% of admissions are COVID-19 patients to 22,101 (95% IPR, 5,904–25,881) if 100% of admissions are COVID-19 patients (assuming single use per respirator, and 10 encounters between HCWs and each COVID-19 patient per day). The number of N95s needed decreases to a range of 22 (95% IPR, 10–43) to 4,445 (95% IPR, 1,975–8,684) if each N95 is used for 5 patient encounters. Varying monthly all-cause admissions to 2,000 requires 6,645–13,404 respirators with a 60% COVID-19 admission prevalence, 10 HCW–patient encounters, and reusing N95s 5–10 times. Nationally, the number of N95 respirators needed over the course of the pandemic ranges from 86 million (95% IPR, 37.1–200.6 million) to 1.6 billion (95% IPR, 0.7–3.6 billion) as 5%–90% of the population is exposed (single-use). This number ranges from 17.4 million (95% IPR, 7.3–41 million) to 312.3 million (95% IPR, 131.5–737.3 million) using each respirator for 5 encounters.

Its prevention and control require a concerted effort to improve awareness among women regarding primary and secondary prevention strategies as well as access to care for treatment and palliation. A focused strategy is important to reach the World Health Organization’s targets for cervical cancer elimination, due to be completed by 2030. METHODS: Currently available literature was reviewed regarding cervical cancer prevention strategies in India including various national programmes and other initiatives on the part of government, non-governmental organizations and professional organizations. Their applicability to the present situation was assessed. RESULTS: National programmes need to build on success stories of various states and neighbouring countries as well as to audit the performance. Strengthening of cancer registries and improvement of linkages between different healthcare levels with incorporation of task-shifting, adding digital technology and supporting programmes that promote women’s welfare and health will also provide synergy to cancer control programmes. In the current pandemic era, HPV self-sampling can be an ideal method for screening. The development of an affordable, point-of-care HPV test is urgently needed to facilitate its introduction in low- and middle-income countries. HPV vaccination efforts need to be speeded up. CONCLUSION: Scaling up of cervical cancer prevention with inclusion of widespread HPV vaccination and primary HPV test should be the new standard of care.","Bhatla, Neerja; Meena, Jyoti; Kumari, Sarita; Banerjee, Dipanwita; Singh, Prerana; Natarajan, Jayashree",Indian J Gynecol Oncol,86,16

Methods The first imported SARS-CoV-2 infection case in Wuhan was admitted in hospital for quarantine and observation. The T cell responses were followed up by flow cytometry analysis of the peripheral blood nonnuclear cells (PBMCs) at days 7, 13, 22, and 28 after admission. Findings We found the first imported SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan is an asymptomatic case. His T cell differentiation, proliferation and activation matched the classical kinetics of T cell responses induced by viral infection, but the activation maintained at a relatively low level. Function analysis indicated frequencies of IFN-{gamma} producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were notably lower than that of the healthy controls (HC) at day 7, and then rebound gradually. But IFN-{gamma}+CD8+ T cells were detained at a significant lower level even at day 28, when the SARS-CoV-2 virus had already become undetectable for 3 weeks. Moreover, percentage of IL-17 producing CD4+ T cells was also detained constantly at a much lower level compared to HC. At day 7, although percentage of Tregs was in normal range, the frequency of activated Treg (aTreg) was remarkably as high as 4.4-fold of that in HC. Interpretation The T cell activation in the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection experienced a significant suppression and presented impairment of Th1/Th17 and CD8+ T cell functions. Early elevation of the aTregs might play role in the activation and function of T cells in the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Yang, J.; Zhang, E.; Zhong, M.; Yang, Q.; Hong, K.; Shu, T.; Zhou, D.; Xiang, J.; Xia, J.; Zhou, X.; Zhang, D.; Huang, C.; Shang, Y.; Yan, H.",,86,16

Based on the enrichment levels of 11 immune signatures (eight immune-inciting and three immune-inhibiting signatures) in leukocytes of 100 COVID-19 patients, we identified three COVID-19 subtypes: Im-C1, Im-C2, and Im-C3, by clustering analysis. Im-C1 had the lowest immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C2 had medium immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C3 had the highest immune-inciting signatures while the lowest immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C3 and Im-C1 displayed the best and worst clinical outcomes, respectively, suggesting that antiviral immune responses alleviated the severity of COVID-19 patients. We further demonstrated that the adaptive immune response had a stronger impact on COVID-19 outcomes than the innate immune response. The patients in Im-C3 were younger than those in Im-C1, indicating that younger persons have stronger antiviral immune responses than older persons. Nevertheless, we did not observe a significant association between sex and immune responses in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we found that the type II IFN response signature was an adverse prognostic factor for COVID-19. Our identification of COVID-19 immune subtypes has potential clinical implications for the management of COVID-19 patients.","Chen, Zuobing; Feng, Qiushi; Zhang, Tianfang; Wang, Xiaosheng",Int Immunopharmacol,86,1

We describe environmental detection of SARS-CoV-2 in households of persons with COVID-19 to better characterize the potential risks of fomite transmission. Ten households with ≥1 person with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and with ≥2 members total were enrolled in Utah, U.S.A. Nasopharyngeal and anterior nasal swabs were collected from members and tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Fifteen surfaces were sampled in each household and tested for presence and viability of SARS-CoV-2.

To control the rapid dispersion of the virus, Iraq, like other countries, has imposed national lockdown measures, such as social distancing, restriction of automobile traffic, and industrial enterprises. This has led to reduced human activities and air pollutant emissions, which caused improvement in air quality. This study focused on the analysis of the impact of the six partial, total, and post-lockdown periods (1st partial lockdown from March 1 to16, 2020, 1st total lockdown from March 17 to April 21, 2nd partial lockdown from April 22 to May 23, 2nd total lockdown from May 24 to June 13, 3rd partial lockdown from June 14 to August 19, and end partial lockdown from August 20 to 31) on the average of daily NO(2), O(3), PM(2.5), and PM(10) concentrations, as well as air quality index (AQI) in 18 Iraqi provinces during these periods (from March 1st to August 31st, 2020). The analysis showed a decline in the average of daily PM(2.5), PM(10), and NO(2) concentrations by 24%, 15%, and 8%, respectively from March 17 to April 21, 2020 (first phase of total lockdown) in comparison to the 1st phase of partial lockdown (March 1 to March 16, 2020). Furthermore, the O(3) increased by 10% over the same period. The 2nd phase of total lockdown, the 3rd partial lockdown, and the post-lockdown periods witnessed declines in PM(2.5) by 8%, 11%, and 21%, respectively, while the PM(10) increases over the same period. Iraqi also witnessed improvement in the AQI by 8% during the 1st phase of total lockdown compared to the 1st phase of partial lockdown. The level of air pollutants in Iraq declined significantly during the six lockdown periods as a result of reduced human activities.

Among them, lineages B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 contain a key mutation N501Y. B.1.135 and P.1 lineages have another mutation, E484K. Here, we decode the effect of these two mutations on the host receptor, ACE2, and neutralizing antibody (B38) recognition. The gain in binding affinity for the N501Y RBD mutant to the ACE2 is attributed to improved π-π stacking and π-cation interactions. The enhanced receptor affinity of the E484K mutant is caused due to the formation of a specific hydrogen bond and salt-bridge interaction with Glu75 of ACE2. Notably, both the mutations reduce the binding affinity for B38 due to the loss of several hydrogen-bonding interactions.

This study constructs a hybrid approach by integrating the fuzzy logic and Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methods to identify the most influential criteria affecting the performance of wealth management banks in Taiwan during the 2019–2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys and interviews are designed using four dimensions (bank performance, service quality, customer relationship, and COVID-19) and 16 criteria for 10 banking executives using fuzzy linguistic scales, to obtain their expert opinions. The results show the order of influence as being service quality, customer relationships, bank performance, and COVID-19. The most important criteria are customized investment information (in-service quality), switching behavior (in-customer relationship), fee income (in-bank performance), and the number of confirmed cases in the top five countries affected by COVID-19. The managerial implication is that wealth management banks should focus on improving their service quality. Banks may strive to provide a wide range of customized investment information and increase customers’ usage of personalized financial products and services. The results of this study will benefit bank managers in serving high-net-worth individuals during the crisis period.","Lin, Arthur J.; Chang, Hai-Yen; Huang, Sun-Weng; Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung",Int,86,3

They possess diverse complex skeletons and a broad spectrum of therapeutically relevant biological activities including anti-inflammatory, anti-chikungunya virus, anti-HIV, cytotoxic, and multidrug resistance-reversing activities as well as curative effects on thrombotic diseases. Among macrocyclic diterpenes of Euphorbia, the discovery of jatrophane and modified jatrophane diterpenes with a wide range of structurally unique polyoxygenated polycyclic derivatives and as a new class of powerful inhibitors of P-glycoprotein has opened new frontiers for research studies on this genus. In this review, an attempt has been made to give in-depth coverage of the articles on the naturally occurring jatrophanes and rearranged jatrophane-type diterpenes isolated from species belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family published from 1984 to March 2019, with emphasis on the biogenesis, isolation methods, structure, biological activity, and structure–activity relationship.

We aimed to quantify the present state of its leadership as a baseline to inform future research. MATERIALS AND METHODS Lists of leaders on the American Society of Transplant Surgeons Council, the COVID-19 Strike Force, and 20 different American Society of Transplant Surgeons committees were obtained from the Society's website. Demographic and training information for the members were compiled through internet searches and analyzed. RESULTS The American Society of Transplant Surgeons Council included 15 members, with 20% women. It was 93.3% non-Hispanic White. The COVID-19 Strike Force included 12 surgeons, 16.7% of whom were female, with 75% non-Hispanic White. Of the 198 committee members, 23.7% were women, 68.7% were nonHispanic White, 16.6% were Asian, 8.1% were Hispanic, and 6.6% were Black. Among female committee members, underrepresented minorities comprised 23.6%. Committee chairs included 23% women, 23% underrepresented minorities, and 2.3% minority women. International medical graduates were more likely men (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS Representation of women in the American Society of Transplant Surgeons leadership has kept pace with their membership in the transplant surgery workforce. There is a deficiency of female under - represented minorities in leadership positions at the Society. Further interventions are required to recruit underrepresented minorities to transplant surgery, catalog their footprint in the workforce, and champion their role as leaders within the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.","Choubey, Ankur P; Bullock, Brenna; Hoste, Ben; Ortiz, Alejandro; Khan, Samar A; Mishra, Anil; Pearson, Terra; Koizumi, Naoru; Ortiz, Jorge",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,86,28

The aim of this review is to provide a clinical approach of SARS-CoV-2 neurological complications based on the direct or indirect (systemic/immune-mediated) role of the SARS-CoV-2 in their genesis. METHODS: A review of the current literature has been carried out up to May 20th 2020 according to the PRISMA guidelines. All case series and reports of adult neurological manifestations associated to SARS-CoV-2 published in English were considered. Review and fundamental research studies on Coronaviruses neuroinvasive potential were analyzed to support pathogenic hypothesis and possible underlying mechanisms. Clinical patterns were subdivided into three groups according to putative underlying mechanisms: direct invasion of central or peripheral nervous system, systemic disorders leading to acute CNS injuries and post-infectious neurological syndromes (PINS). RESULTS: Sixteen case series and 26 case reports for a total of 903 patients were identified presenting with neurological involvement during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hypo/anosmia and dys/ageusia were found in 826 patients and mainly attributed to direct viral invasion. Cerebrovascular complications occurred in 51 patients and related to viral infection associated systemic inflammation. PINS were described in only 26 patients. A wide heterogeneity of these reports emerged concerning the extension of the clinical examination and ancillary exams performed. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 are mainly related to olfactory and gustatory sensory perception disorders through possible direct nervous system invasion while cerebrovascular disease and PINS are rare and due to distinct and indirect pathophysiological mechanisms.","Scoppettuolo, Pasquale; Borrelli, Serena; Naeije, Gilles",Brain Behav Immun Health,86,20

Surveys were anonymous with ballot box collection being available to the bedside ICU nurses for one week each. Questions were based on literature findings of expected outcomes, identified barriers and facilitators, Calgary Family Intervention Method framework domains, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Framework for program evaluation. Outcome measures were taken from the stated aims of the project and evaluated from paired baseline and summative survey questions. Survey participation was approximately half of nurses employed in the studied ICU. Analysis of the surveys showed a positive perception of family presence decreasing patient delirium symptoms, and a positive perception of the Family HELP protocol. The results described a high perception of family members as partners in care and high intention to implement the Family HELP protocol, indicating strong support of a full implementation of the protocol. The high level of bedside nurse buy-in present in this study has large implications for successful implementation of the Family HELP protocol in the near future, with sustainability and continued use supported by potential inclusion of the task in the electronic health record charting.","McClay, Rebecca",Healthcare (Basel),86,16

The goal of this analysis is to explore predictors of COVID-19 testing through cross-country comparisons, in order to better inform testing policies. METHODS: Testing and case-based data was amassed from Our World in Data, and information regarding predictors was gathered from the World Bank. We investigate Human Development Index (HDI), health expenditure, universal health coverage (UHC), urban population, service industry workers (%), and air pollution as predictors. We explored testing data through July 31(st), 2020, or most recently available, using case-indexing methods which involve synchronizing countries by date of first reported COVID-19 case as an index date and normalizing to the cumulative tests 25 days post-index date. Three multivariable linear regression models were built in a stepwise fashion to explore the association between the indexed number of COVID-19 tests and HDI scores. RESULTS: A total of 86 countries were included in the final analytical sample, excluding countries with missing data. HDI and urban population were found to be significantly associated with testing.

However, the role of this heterogeneity in shaping the overall dynamics of disease transmission is not well understood. Objective: To investigate the role of heterogeneous transmission among different towns in Massachusetts in shaping the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission, especially the recent decline during winter of 2020/2021. Design, Setting, Participants: Analysis of COVID-19 data collected and archived by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Exposures: The entire population of the state of Massachusetts is exposed to the virus responsible for COVID-19, to varying degrees. This study quantifies this variation. Main outcome measures: Weekly observations, by town, on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts, during the period (April 15th, 2020 to February 9th 2021). Results: The relative decline in COVID-19 cases, during January 12th, 2021 to February 9th, 2021, in the group of towns with higher total accumulated cases in the period before January 12th, 2021 is significantly larger than the corresponding relative decline in the group of towns with lower accumulated cases during the same period. Conclusions and Relevance: Heterogeneous nature of transmission is playing a significant role in shaping the rapid recent decline (January 12th to February 9th, 2021) in reported cases in Massachusetts, and probably around the country. These findings are relevant to how we estimate the threshold defining herd immunity, suggesting that we should account for effects due to heterogeneity.","Choi, Y.-W.; Castro, M. C.; Eltahir, E. A.

SARS-Cov-2 variants of concern (VOC) exhibiting greater transmissibility, and potentially increased risk of hospitalization, severity and mortality, are attributed to molecular mutations in outer viral surface spike proteins. Thus, there is a reliance on using appropriate counter-disease measures including non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination. Best evidence suggests that use of frontline biocides effectively inactivate coronavirus similarly, including VOC, such as 202012/01, 501Y.V2 and P.1 that have rapidly replaced the wild-type variant in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil, respectively. However, this review highlights that efficacy of VOC-disinfection will depend on type of biocide and parameters governing activity. VOC are likely to be similar in size to the wild-type strain, thus implying that existing guidelines for use and re-use of face masks post disinfection remain relevant. Monitoring to avoid injudicious use of biocides during COVID-19 era is required as prolonged and excessive biocide usage may negatively impact our receiving environments; thus, highlighting the potential for alternative more environmental-friendly sustainable biocide solutions. Traditional biocides may promote cross-antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to antibiotics in problematical bacteria. Existing filtration efficacy of face masks is likely to perform similarly for VOC due to similar viral size; however, advances in face mask manufacturing by way incorporating new anti-viral materials will potentially enhance their design and functionality for existing and potentially future pandemics.","Rowan, Neil J.; Meade, Elaine; Garvey, Mary",Curr Opin Environ Sci Health,86,33

We aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COPD-related hospital admissions and mortality in relation to the presence of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a case–control study of patients admitted in four teaching hospitals throughout Spain between March 15 and April 30, 2020. Hospital admissions of respiratory cause with and without PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with COPD were evaluated. Baseline and episode-related clinical characteristics were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the risk for mortality. RESULTS: During the study period, 2101 patients were admitted for respiratory worsening, 1200 (57.1%) with COVID-19. A total of 228 (10.8%) were admitted due to COPD worsening, of whom 52 (22.8%) tested positive for COVID-19. COPD patients with COVID-19, when compared to those without COVID-19, were more frequently males with better lung function (FEV(1) postbronchodilator 71% vs 46% respectively, p<0.001) and had higher mortality (44.9% vs 13.6% respectively, p<0.001) despite similar age, comorbidities, total days of hospitalization and admission to intensive care unit. COVID-19 and eosinopenia were the strongest risk factors for mortality in the multivariate analysis in the overall COPD population. Inhaled corticosteroid use was not associated to mortality.

Common clinical and nonclinical diagnostic testing methods have been partially effective in satisfying the increasing demand for fast detection point-of-care (POC) methods to slow down further spread. However, accurate point-of-risk diagnosis of this emerging viral infection is paramount as the need for simultaneous standard operating procedures and symptom management of SARS-CoV-2 will be the norm for years to come.

A better understanding of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) pathogenesis and identification of the responsive genes will contribute to controlling PEDV infection. Therefore, screening and identifying PEDV-resistance functional genes and then implementing disease resistance breeding have important scientific significance. This study explores the regulatory roles of the GLP-2 gene in regulating PEDV infection and in repairing the intestinal mucosa damage associated with PEDV infection. The findings may contribute to the identification of resistant genes or genetic markers for disease resistance breeding in pigs. ABSTRACT: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infects intestinal epithelial cells, destroys the intestinal mucosal barrier and then causes diarrhea in piglets. Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is a specific intestinal growth hormone that promotes the repair of damaged intestinal mucosa and improves the intestinal barrier. In this study, we investigated the functions of porcine GLP-2 gene in regulating PEDV infection. The intestinal tissues with damaged intestinal structures caused by PEDV infection were first confirmed and collected. Expression analysis indicated that the GLP-2 gene was expressed in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum tissues, and the mRNA level was significantly down-regulated in jejunum and ileum of piglets with damaged intestinal mucosa. Infection of PEDV to porcine small intestinal epithelial cells in vitro showed that GLP-2 gene was significantly decreased, which was consistent with the expression pattern in intestinal tissues. In addition, we silenced the GLP-2 gene by shRNA interfering and found that the copy numbers of PEDV were remarkably increased in the GLP-2 gene silencing cells. Our findings suggest that the GLP-2 gene was potentially involved in regulating PEDV infection and in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier structure, which could contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of PEDV pathogenesis and provide a theoretical basis for the identification and application of resistant genes in pig selective breeding for porcine epidemic diarrhea.","Zhou, Yajing; Ren, Zhanshi; Zhang, Shuai; Wang, Haifei; Wu, Shenglong; Bao, Wenbin",Animals (Basel),86,2

Opaganib is a selective sphingosine-kinase (SK)-2 inhibitor with anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties. Methods. We provided opaganib on a compassionate-use basis to patients with severe COVID-19. Patients who required oxygen support via high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) were offered the treatment. For comparison, we used a control group with same-sex, same-severity patients. Results. Seven patients received at least one dose of opaganib since April 2, 2020. One patient, who received both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, developed diarrhea and all his medications were stopped. This was the only adverse effect possibly related to opaganib. A second patient was weaned of oxygen and discharged after receiving two doses of opaganib. Therefore, five patients were included in this analysis. Baseline characteristics were not significantly different between cases and controls. Patients treated with opaganib had significantly faster increase in lymphocyte count. All other clinical outcomes had a non-statistically significant trend in favor of the treatment group: median time to weaning from HFNC was 10 and 15 days in cases vs. controls (HR= 0.3, 95% CI: 0.07-1.7, p=0.2) ,time to ambient air was 13 vs.14.5 days (HR=0.4, 95% CI: 0.15-1.5), none of the cases required mechanical ventilation compared with 33% of controls. Conclusion. In this small cohort of severe COVID-19 patients, opaganib was safe and well tolerated with improvement in both clinical and laboratory parameters in all treated patients. The efficacy of opaganib for COVID-19 infection should be further tested in randomized placebo-controlled trials.","Kurd, R.; Ben-Chetrit, E.; Karameh, H.; Bar-Meir, M.",,86,1

For students placed in rural areas, already coping with isolation, precarious supply chains and shortages of essential personnel, the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak may have far-reaching implications for psychosocial wellness, self-efficacy and clinical judgment. Four nursing and eight medical students (n = 12) supplied photographs and commentary documenting the experience of withdrawing suddenly from clinical sites in rural Alberta. Collaborative, thematic analysis revealed continuities between pre- and post-outbreak life, both for the students and their rural hosts. Social determinants of health such as seclusion, environmental hazards, and health-seeking behaviors carried over and compounded the effects of the outbreak on the placement communities and clinical sites. Other continuities included the reliance on technology for clinical and social connectivity, and capitalizing on natural settings to cope with isolation and confinement. Prolonged liminality, lack of closure, and the loss of team identity were the greatest stressors brought on by the suspension of clinical activities. However, the participants felt well equipped to deal with these circumstances through the resilience, adaptability, and community ethos acquired during their placements.","Jackman, Deirdre; Konkin, Jill; Yonge, Olive; Myrick, Florence; Cockell, Jim",Nurse Educ Pract,86,1

With neither sufficient vaccination capacity nor effective medication, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) remain the measure of choice. However, NPIs place a great burden on society, the mental health of individuals, and economics. Therefore the cost/benefit ratio must be carefully balanced and a target-oriented small-scale implementation of these NPIs could help achieve this balance. To this end, we introduce a modified SEIRD-class compartment model and parametrize it locally for all 412 districts of Germany. The NPIs are modeled at district level by time varying contact rates. This high spatial resolution makes it possible to apply geostatistical methods to analyse the spatial patterns of the pandemic in Germany and to compare the results of different spatial resolutions. We find that the modified SEIRD model can successfully be fitted to the COVID-19 cases in German districts, states, and also nationwide. We propose the correlation length as a further measure, besides the weekly incidence rates, to describe the current situation of the epidemic.","Schüler, Lennart; Calabrese, Justin M.; Attinger, Sabine",PLoS One,86,1

Here we characterise the differential risk of hospitalisation and death in São Paulo state, Brazil, and show how vulnerability to COVID-19 is shaped by socioeconomic inequalities. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using hospitalised severe acute respiratory infections notified from March to August 2020 in the Sistema de Monitoramento Inteligente de São Paulo database. We examined the risk of hospitalisation and death by race and socioeconomic status using multiple data sets for individual-level and spatiotemporal analyses. We explained these inequalities according to differences in daily mobility from mobile phone data, teleworking behaviour and comorbidities. RESULTS: Throughout the study period, patients living in the 40% poorest areas were more likely to die when compared with patients living in the 5% wealthiest areas (OR: 1.60, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.74) and were more likely to be hospitalised between April and July 2020 (OR: 1.08, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.12). Black and Pardo individuals were more likely to be hospitalised when compared with White individuals (OR: 1.41, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.46; OR: 1.26, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.28, respectively), and were more likely to die (OR: 1.13, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.19; 1.07, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.10, respectively) between April and July 2020. Once hospitalised, patients treated in public hospitals were more likely to die than patients in private hospitals (OR: 1.40%, 95% CI 1.34% to 1.46%). Black individuals and those with low education attainment were more likely to have one or more comorbidities, respectively (OR: 1.29, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.39; 1.36, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.45). CONCLUSIONS: Low-income and Black and Pardo communities are more likely to die with COVID-19.

This study investigated the relationship between serum interleukin (IL)‐18, IL‐1 receptor antagonist (IL‐1Ra), and alpha defensin levels and the clinical course and prognosis of COVID‐19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 100 patients who were admitted to the chest diseases department and intensive care unit of our hospital and diagnosed with COVID‐19 by real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal swab samples between March 24 and May 31, 2020. The control group consisted of 50 nonsymptomatic health workers with negative real‐time PCR results in routine COVID‐19 screening in our hospital. RESULTS: Serum alpha defensin, IL‐1Ra, and IL‐18 levels were significantly higher in patients who developed macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared to patients who did not (p < .001 for all). Alpha defensin, IL‐1Ra, and IL‐18 levels were significantly higher in COVID‐19 patients with and without MAS or ARDS when compared to the control group (p < .001 for all). When the 9 patients who died were compared with the 91 surviving patients, IL‐1Ra and IL‐18 levels were found to be significantly higher in the nonsurvivors (p < .001). CONCLUSION: Our findings of correlations between alpha defensin and levels of IL‐1Ra and IL‐18, which were previously shown to be useful in COVID‐19 treatment and follow‐up, indicates that it may also be promising in treatment.","Kerget, Buğra; Kerget, Ferhan; Aksakal, Alperen; Aşkın, Seda; Sağlam, Leyla; Akgün, Metin",J Med Virol,86,29

This study aimed to estimate COVID-19 incidence and mortality in residential care facilities and to compare them with those recorded in nursing homes. Design Nationwide observational study conducted by French health authorities. Settings and participants Since March 1, 2020, all LTCFs in France reported all COVID-19 cases and COVID-19-related deaths among their residents. Methods Possible cases were those with COVID-19 related symptoms without laboratory confirmation and confirmed cases those with a RT-PCR test or serology positive for SARS-CoV-2. We included facilities with at least one confirmed case of COVID-19 and estimated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases and mortality due to COVID-19 reported until June 30th, 2020, using the maximum bed capacity as a denominator. Results Of the 2,288 residential care facilities, 310 (14%) and of the 7,688 nursing homes, 3,110 (40%) reported COVID-19 cases among residents (p<0.001). The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was significantly lower in residential care facilities as compared with nursing homes (1.10 vs 9.97 per 100 beds, p<0.001. Mortality due to COVID-19 was also lower in residential care facilities compared with nursing homes (0.07 vs 1.29 per 100 beds, p<0.001). Case fatality was lower in residential care facilities (6.49% vs 12.93%, p<0.001). Conclusion and implications: French residential care facilities experienced a much lower burden from COVID-19 than nursing homes.

IL-35 is a newly identified IL-12 cytokine family member that plays an important protective role in a variety of immune system diseases by regulating Treg cell differentiation; however, the role of IL-35 in the pathogenesis of ARDS is still unclear. Here, we found that IL-35 was significantly elevated in adult patients with ARDS compared to controls. Additionally, IL-35 was positively and significantly correlated with IL-6, IL-10 and the oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2 ratio) but negatively correlated with TNF-α, IL-1β and APACHE II score during ARDS. Moreover, the proportion of Treg/CD4(+) cells in the peripheral blood of ARDS patients and the expression of NF-κB in PMBCs were significantly higher than in healthy individuals. Recombinant IL-35 improved survival in a murine model of CLP-induced ARDS. Additionally, IL-35 administration decreased the inflammatory response, as reflected by lower levels of cytokines (including IL-2, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) and less lung damage in CLP-induced ARDS. Furthermore, recombinant IL-35 reduced the apoptosis of lung tissue and the expression of NF-κB signalling in a CLP-induced ARDS model and increased the proportion of Treg cells in spleen and peripheral blood. In vitro experiments revealed that IL-35 can affect the phosphorylation of STAT5 during differentiation of naïve CD4(+) T lymphocytes into Foxp3(+)Helios(+) Tregs. Our findings suggest that IL-35 attenuates ARDS by promoting the differentiation of naïve CD4(+) T cells into Foxp3(+)Helios(+) Tregs, thereby providing a novel tool for anti-ARDS therapy.","Wang, Chuanjiang; Xie, Ke; Li, Kefeng; Lin, Shihui; Xu, Fang",Mol Immunol,86,31

The changes in teaching methods, teaching conditions, and teaching environment have brought great pressure and difficulties in adjustment to teachers, which have led to a series of physical and mental problems such as negativity, lack of confidence, and depression. The long-term accumulation of these problems makes teachers’ turnover intention increasingly serious. Methods: Based on these premises, this study took 449 high school teachers in China as research objects and investigated the relationship between high school teachers’ resilience, job burnout, and turnover intention in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. Results: The resilience of high school teachers had a significant negative predictive effect on job burnout and turnover intention (r = −0.473, p < 0.05; r = −0.283, p < 0.05), while job burnout had a significant positive predictive effect on turnover intention (r = 0.485, p < 0.05). At the same time, job burnout played a moderating role between resilience and turnover intention (λ = −0.019, p < 0.001). Discussion: This study suggests that society, schools, families, and individuals should adopt various strategies to improve teachers’ adaptability and relieve teachers’ job burnout, so as to solve the practical problem of teachers’ high turnover intention and ensure continuous improvement and healthy development of online teaching.","Liu, Fei; Chen, Huaruo; Xu, Jie; Wen, Ya; Fang, Tingting",Int J Environ Res Public Health,86,4

Approximately 5–12% of COVID-19 patients require admission to the intensive-care unit (ICU), where they often require oxygen therapy and prolonged intubation. Post-intubation laryngotracheal stenosis (PILS) is a complication that occurs in 10–22% of non-COVID-19 patients after prolonged intubation, while the rate of COVID-19 related PILS remains unknown. Additionally, there is still no consensus in the literature regarding the management modalities for PILS following COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report two cases of tracheal stenosis after prolonged intubation due to severe COVID-19 infection. The first patient was admitted to the ICU and intubated for 21 days; 3 months after discharge, he developed a 3 cm long tracheal stenosis that narrowed 70% of the lumen. The second patient was intubated for 2 months and, 4 months after discharge, developed a 2.5 cm long tracheal stenosis that narrowed 80% of the lumen. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: In both cases, the diagnosis was confirmed by CT scan and Rigid bronchoscopy; then, they were managed successfully with tracheal resection and reconstruction by end-to-end anastomosis. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we would like to highlight the importance of suspecting PILS in recovered COVID-19 patients re-presenting with breathing difficulties following weaning from mechanical ventilation; therefore, careful follow-up in such patients is required. Moreover, we would like to point out that the management of tracheal stenosis after COVID-19 appears to be similar to that of tracheal stenosis in general.","Alturk, Ahmad; Bara, Albaraa; Darwish, Bassam",Ann Med Surg (Lond),86,20

METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was designed based on modifications of related questionnaires, and used to assess levels of stress, professionalism, and nursing intention according to participants' experiences during the outbreak. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between the outbreak nursing experience and nursing intention considering stress and nursing professionalism. RESULTS: The overall stress, professionalism, and nursing intention scores for the firsthand experience group were 33.72, 103.00, and 16.92, respectively, whereas those of the secondhand experience group were 32.25, 98.99, and 15.60, respectively. There were significant differences in professionalism and nursing intention scores between the groups (p = .001 and p < .001, respectively). The regression analysis revealed that the regression estimate between stress and nursing intention was B(SE) = −0.08(0.02), beta = −0.21, p < .001 and the regression estimate between professionalism in nursing and nursing intention was B(SE) = 0.05(0.01), beta = 0.23, p < .001.

In contrast, TSLP activates dendritic cells to induce strong T-cell proliferation and is involved in inflammatory T helper (Th) 2 responses in human allergic diseases. However, it is not clear how TSLP production by IECs is regulated in ulcerative colitis (UC), which appears to involve inflammatory Th2 responses. The aim of this study is to examine how TSLP production by IECs is regulated in ulcerative colitis. RESULTS: We show here that expression of TSLP was enhanced in mucosal lesions from UC patients in which inflammatory Th2 cytokine production was predominant. In addition, using a human colonic epithelial cell line, we demonstrated that a combination of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) induced TSLP expression and that TSLP expression by TNF-α + IL-4 was further enhanced by either Toll-like receptor 3 ligand or interferon (IFN)-γ. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, as in human allergic diseases, an inflammatory Th2 condition in the mucosal lesions of UC patients may trigger increased TSLP expression by IECs, resulting in exacerbation of UC.","Tanaka, Junya; Saga, Kazuyuki; Kido, Masahiro; Nishiura, Hisayo; Akamatsu, Takuji; Chiba, Tsutomu; Watanabe, Norihiko",Dig Dis Sci,86,21

Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include diarrhea, pneumonia, lymphopenia, exhausted lymphocytes, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Immunology is part of the process of clinical evolution, but there are some questions around immunity-based protection: (1) why some infected people have only mild symptoms of the disease or are asymptomatic; (2) why delayed and weak antibody responses are associated with severe outcomes; and (3) why positivity in molecular tests does not represent protective antibody IgG. Perhaps T cell responses may be the key to solving those questions. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells persist in peripheral blood and may be capable of providing effective information about protective immunity. The T cells studies can be helpful in elucidating the pathways for development of vaccines, therapies, and diagnostics for COVID-19 and for filling these immunology knowledge gaps.","Gil Melgaço, Juliana; Azamor, Tamiris; Paula Dinis Ano Bom, Ana",Cell Immunol,86,21

Over a period of 7 weeks from early February through late March 2021, wastewater originating from the residence hall was collected as grab samples 3 times per week. During this time, there was no detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in the residence hall wastewater stream. Aiming to obtain a sample more representative of the residence hall community, a decision was made to use passive samplers beginning in late March onwards. Adopting a Moore swab approach, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in wastewater samples just 2 days after passive samplers were deployed. These samples also tested positive for the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant of concern (VOC) using RT-qPCR. The positive result triggered a public health case-finding response, including a mobile testing unit deployed to the residence hall the following day, with testing of nearly 200 students and staff, which identified two laboratory-confirmed cases of Alpha variant COVID-19. These individuals were relocated to a separate quarantine facility, averting an outbreak on campus. Aggregating wastewater and clinical data, the campus wastewater surveillance program has yielded the first estimates of fecal shedding rates of the Alpha VOC of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals from a nonclinical setting. IMPORTANCE Among early adopters of wastewater monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 have been colleges and universities throughout North America, many of whom are using this approach to monitor congregate living facilities for early evidence of COVID-19 infection as an integral component of campus screening programs. Yet, while there have been numerous examples where wastewater monitoring on a university campus has detected evidence for infection among community members, there are few examples where this monitoring triggered a public health response that may have averted an actual outbreak. This report details a wastewater-testing program targeting a residence hall on a university campus during spring 2021, when there was mounting concern globally over the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, reported to be more transmissible than the wild-type Wuhan strain. In this communication, we present a clear example of how wastewater monitoring resulted in actionable responses by university administration and public health, which averted an outbreak of COVID-19 on a university campus.","Corchis-Scott, Ryland; Geng, Qiudi; Seth, Rajesh; Ray, Rajan; Beg, Mohsan; Biswas, Nihar; Charron, Lynn; Drouillard, Kenneth D; D'Souza, Ramsey; Heath, Daniel D; Houser, Chris; Lawal, Felicia; McGinlay, James; Menard, Sherri Lynne; Porter, Lisa A; Rawlings, Diane; Scholl, Matthew L; Siu, K W Michael; Tong, Yufeng; Weisener, Christopher G; Wilhelm, Steven W; McKay, R Michael L",Microbiol Spectr,86,3

We completed serological assays using samples collected from health care workers to identify antibody types associated with SARS-CoV-2 protection and COVID-19 symptom duration. Rare SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibodies elicited by past CCV infections were not associated with protection; however, the duration of symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infections was significantly reduced in individuals with higher common betacoronavirus (βCoV) antibody titers. Since antibody titers decline over time after CCV infections, individuals in our cohort with higher βCoV antibody titers were more likely recently infected with common βCoVs compared with individuals with lower antibody titers. Therefore, our data suggest that recent βCoV infections potentially limit the duration of symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infections through mechanisms that do not involve cross-reactive antibodies. Our data are consistent with the emerging hypothesis that cellular immune responses elicited by recent common βCoV infections transiently reduce symptom duration following SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Gouma, Sigrid; Weirick, Madison E.; Bolton, Marcus J.; Arevalo, Claudia P.; Goodwin, Eileen C.; Anderson, Elizabeth M.; McAllister, Christopher M.; Christensen, Shannon R.; Dunbar, Debora; Fiore, Danielle; Brock, Amanda; Weaver, JoEllen; Millar, John; DerOhannessian, Stephanie; Unit, The UPenn COVID Processing; Frank, Ian; Rader, Daniel J.; Wherry, E.

So far, several different types of vaccines have shown strong efficacy. However, both the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and the need to vaccinate a large fraction of the world’s population necessitate the development of alternative vaccines, especially those that are simple and easy to store, transport and administer. Here, we showed that ferritin-like Dps protein from hyperthermophilic Sulfolobus islandicus can be covalently coupled with different SARS-CoV-2 antigens via the SpyCatcher system, to form extremely stable and defined multivalent dodecameric vaccine nanoparticles that remain intact even after lyophilisation. Immunisation experiments in mice demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) coupled to Dps (RBD-S-Dps) shows particular promise as it elicited a higher antibody titre and an enhanced neutralising antibody response compared to the monomeric RBD. Furthermore, we showed that a single immunisation with the multivalent RBD-S-Dps completely protected hACE2-expressing mice from serious illness and led to efficient viral clearance from the lungs upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Herein, we sought to assess viral load in the nasopharyngeal swab and its association with severity score indexes and prognostic parameters. Methods: We included 127 symptomatic patients and 21 asymptomatic subjects with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection obtained by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and presence of cycle threshold. According to the level of care needed during hospitalization, the population was categorized as high-intensity (HIMC, n = 76) or low intensity medical care setting (LIMC, n = 51). Results: Viral load did not differ among asymptomatic, LIMC, and HIMC SARS-CoV-2 positive patients [4.4 (2.9–5.3) vs. 4.8 (3.6–6.1) vs. 4.6 (3.9–5.7) log10 copies/ml, respectively; p = 0.31]. Similar results were observed when asymptomatic individuals were compared to hospitalized patients [4.4 (2.9–5.3) vs. 4.68 (3.8–5.9) log10 copies/ml; p = 0.13]. When the study population was divided in High (HVL, n = 64) and Low Viral Load (LVL, n = 63) group no differences were observed in disease severity at diagnosis. Furthermore, LVL and HVL groups did not differ with regard to duration of hospital stay, number of bacterial co-infections, need for high-intensity medical care and number of deaths. The viral load was not an independent risk factor for HIMC in an adjusted multivariate regression model (OR: 1.59; 95% CI: 0.46–5.55, p = 0.46). Conclusions: Viral load at diagnosis is similar in asymptomatic and hospitalized patients and is not associated with either worse outcomes during hospitalization.

Objective The goals of this study are to report the load and variety of emergent/urgent neurosurgical cases after implementing the ‘Battle Plan’ at an academic tertiary referral center during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare these variables to previous practice at the same institution. Methods The clinical data of all patients who underwent a neurosurgical intervention between March 23, 2020 and April 20, 2020 was obtained from a prospectively maintained database. Data of the control group was retrospectively collected from the medical records to compare the types of surgeries/interventions performed by the same neurosurgical service before the COVID-19 pandemic started. Results Ninety-one patients underwent emergent, urgent and essential neurosurgical interventions over a 4-week period during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient screening at teleclinics identified 11 urgent surgical cases. The implementation of the ‘Battle Plan’ led to a significant decrease in the case load, and the variation of cases by subspecialty is evident when compared to a control group comprised of 214 patients. Conclusion Delivery of optimal care and safe practice and education at an academic neurosurgical department can be well maintained with proper execution of crisis protocols. Teleclinics proved to be efficient in screening patients for urgent neurosurgical conditions, but in-person clinic visits may still be necessary for some cases in the immediate postoperative period.","Noureldine, Mohammad Hassan A.; Pressman, Elliot; Krafft, Paul R.; Greenberg, Mark S.; Agazzi, Siviero; van Loveren, Harry; Alikhani, Puya",World Neurosurg,86,7

Because minimally invasive surgery and general anaesthesia are both aerosol-generating procedures, their use has become controversial. We report a case series of awake undelayable colorectal surgeries which, innovatively, took advantage of intraoperative pain distraction. Moreover, we describe our frugal solution to social distancing in psychological support of inpatients. Methods: Between October 2020 and February 2021, five patients underwent acute-care colorectal surgery under locoregional anaesthesia in our department. A 3D mobile theatre (3DMT) was used during the operation to distract the patients from pain. Vital signs, pain intensity, ergonomic comfort/discomfort, sense of presence and distress were intraoperatively monitored. A postoperative “cuddle delivery” service was instituted: video messages from relatives and close friends were delivered daily to the patient through the 3DMT. Emotional effects were investigated through clinical interviews conducted by a psychologist at our hospital. Results: Both intraoperative and postoperative pain were always well controlled. Conversion to general anaesthesia and postoperative intensive support/monitoring were never necessary. The “cuddle delivery” initiative helped patients fill the emotional gap created by the strict containment measures implemented inside the hospital, distracting them from emotional anxiety and physical pain. Conclusions: During the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and even after the COVID-19 era, awake laparotomy under locoregional anaesthesia may be a crucial option for delivering acute-care surgery to selected patients when intensive care beds are unavailable and postponing surgery is unacceptable. We also introduce a new modality for the provision of emotional support during postoperative inpatient care as a countermeasure to the restrictions imposed by social distancing measures.","Romanzi, Andrea; Gallo, Gaetano; De Rango, Sabrina; Vignati, Barbara; Vannelli, Alberto",Front Surg,86,27

These studies support in vitro observations on Schwann cell behaviour in highlighting the importance of extracellular matrix for both migration and myelin sheath formation.

Vitamin D supplementation has increased over the years, whether through medical prescriptions, over-the-counter, or online purchasing. This is driven by a more recognized association between vitamin D sufficiency status and lower risk of cancer. In addition, more recently, it is used as a potential prophylactic and treatment for COVID-19 infection. This can lead to toxicity from overingestion. While rare, it has been reported in the literature. In this case report, we present a 75-year-old man with severe hypercalcemia secondary to vitamin D toxicity managed with peritoneal dialysis. He presented with biochemical evidence of hypercalcemia, acute kidney injury, and pancreatitis. Workup for his hypercalcemia led to the diagnosis of vitamin D toxicity as shown by a level greater than 200 ng/dL (Ref: 20–50 ng/mL) was confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Cornerstone medical management of hypercalcemia was provided which included aggressive intravenous fluid hydration, intravenous diuretics, calcitonin, bisphosphonate, and corticosteroid therapy. At every interruption of therapy, calcium levels trended upward. A thorough literature review yielded the finding of a sole case report from 1966 presented at the Third International Congress of Nephrology, in which peritoneal dialysis was used in the management of vitamin D toxicity and hypercalcemia. This modality is established to cause vitamin D deficiency. In collaboration with the nephrology team, 10 sessions of peritoneal dialysis were undertaken with resolution of hypercalcemia and downtrend in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels as measured by dilution.","Feghali, Krystel; Papamarkakis, Kostas; Clark, Jackson; Malhotra, Neha; Stoddart, Lanu; Osakwe, Ibitoro",Case Rep Endocrinol,86,30

METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective and observational study, 198 patients with known blood types who diagnosed with MM between January 2012 and June 2020 were included. RESULTS: It was shown that individuals with blood group 0 had a significantly lower risk of MM (OR = 0.575, 95% confidence interval 0.416–0.794, P = 0.001). The incidence of extramedullary lesion was significantly higher in those with 0 blood group compared to other blood groups (P = 0.000). Overall survival was significantly shorter in patients with 0 blood group than those without 0 blood group (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Individuals with 0 blood group had a lower risk of developing MM.

Anthropometric, clinical and biological assessments and skeletal survey evaluations, along with the assessment of nutritional intake and general nutrition knowledge, were performed on 61 patients with a current diagnosis of multiple myeloma. A low carbohydrate diet score was computed, classified in tertiles, and used as a factor in the analysis. Patients in tertiles indicative of high carbohydrate or low carbohydrate intake showed significant alteration of clinical parameters, such as hemoglobin, uric acid, albumin, total proteins, beta-2 microglobulin, percentage of plasmacytes in the bone marrow and D-dimers, compared to patients in the medium carbohydrate intake tertile. Nutrition knowledge was not associated with clinical indicators of disease status, nor with patterns of nutrient intake. Better knowledge of food types and nutritional value of foods, along with personalized nutritional advice, could encourage patients with MM to make healthier decisions that might extend survival.","Borsi, Ema; Serban, Costela Lacrimioara; Potre, Cristina; Potre, Ovidiu; Putnoky, Salomeia; Samfireag, Miruna; Tudor, Raluca; Ionita, Ioana; Ionita, Hortensia",Int J Environ Res Public Health,86,18

RESULT: We included 465 consecutive COVID-19 critically ill patients. The majority (67.1%) of the patients were older than 60 years, with a median (IQR) age of 69 (56.5–75); 240 (51.6%) were male. At 60 days of follow-up, 184 (39.6%) were discharged alive, while 281 (60.4%) died in the intensive care unit. The median (IQR) ICU length of stay was 7 days (4–10) and non-survivors had significantly shorter stay, 6 (3–10) days. The body mass index was 27.9 (24.1–31.6) kg/m2. At admission to the intensive care unit, quick SOFA median (IQR) score was 1 (1–2), whereas total SOFA score was 6 (4–7). In univariate analysis, the following parameters were significantly associated with increased/decreased hazard of mortality: increased age, BMI, white cell count, neutrophils, procalcitonin, cardiac troponin, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, prothrombin, and d-dimer levels were associated with higher risk of mortality. Decreased lymphocytes, and platelet count were associated with higher risk of mortality. Quick SOFA and total SOFA scores increase, emergency intubation, inotrope use, stress myocardiopathy, acute kidney injury, arrythmia, and seizure were associated with higher mortality. CONCLUSION: Our study reported the highest mortality rate (60.4%) among critically ill patients with COVID-19 60 days post-ICU admission. Several factors were found to be predictive of mortality, which may help to identify patients at risk of mortality during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Elhadi, Muhammed; Alsoufi, Ahmed; Abusalama, Abdurraouf; Alkaseek, Akram; Abdeewi, Saedah; Yahya, Mohammed; Mohammed, Alsnosy; Abdelkabir, Mohammed; Huwaysh, Mohammed; Amkhatirah, Emad; Alshorbaji, Kamel; Khel, Samer; Gamra, Marwa; Alhadi, Abdulmueti; Abubaker, Taha; Anaiba, Mohamed; Elmugassabi, Mohammed; Binnawara, Muhannud; Khaled, Ala; Zaid, Ahmed; Msherghi, Ahmed",PLoS One,86,32

To date, few antiviral drugs are available that can effectively block viral infection. This study aimed to identify potential natural products from Taiwan Database of Extracts and Compounds (TDEC) that may prevent the binding of viral spike proteins with human ACE2 proteins. METHODS: The structure-based virtual screening was performed using the AutoDock Vina program within PyRX software, the binding affinities of compounds were verified using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), the inhibitions of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection efficacy were examined by lentivirus particles pseudotyped (Vpp) infection assay, and the cell viability was tested by 293T cell in MTT assay. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We identified 39 natural products targeting the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in silico. In ITC binding assay, dioscin, celastrol, saikosaponin C, epimedin C, torvoside K, and amentoflavone showed dissociation constant (K(d)) = 0.468 μM, 1.712 μM, 6.650 μM, 2.86 μM, 3.761 μM and 4.27 μM, respectively. In Vpp infection assay, the compounds have significantly and consistently inhibition with the 50–90% inhibition of viral infection efficacy. In cell viability, torvoside K, epimedin, amentoflavone, and saikosaponin C showed IC(50) > 100 μM; dioscin and celastrol showed IC(50) = 1.5625 μM and 0.9866 μM, respectively. These natural products may bind to the viral spike protein, preventing SARS-CoV-2 from entering cells. SECTION: 1. Natural Products.

In academic circumstances with the continued presence of emotional disturbance, high demand, and stress, emotional and physical fatigue, typical of burnout syndrome, and can be detected. Anxiety and burnout are related to each other and even more closely in high-stakes tests. One of these tests is the examination imposed in Spain for access to the university. The objective of this work is to analyze the presence of anxiety and burnout and the relationship between them in students who face these tests, both during the confinement situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic and during the pandemic after the lockdown. For this purpose, we used a sample of 1,021 students with a mean age of 17.89 (SD = 1.22, range 17–27). Of these, 866 (84.8%) were students who were taking the test, while the rest were university students who had passed it recently. Our results show high levels of anxiety and burnout in students who face the evaluation test during the COVID-19 pandemic, sustained over time and especially in comparison with students who had already taken the exam. The association between higher levels of anxiety and higher levels of burnout in the students who take these exams was also verified. These results link the relationship between these two variables more solidly and suggest the need to include address anxiety to reduce burnout levels in these students. The results are discussed with regard to prior evidence and their applications.","Fernández-Castillo, Antonio",Front Psychol,86,5

It is imperative that interventions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are targeted towards high-risk populations. We will investigate the associations between social characteristics (such as ethnicity, occupation and socioeconomic position) and COVID-19 outcomes and the extent to which characteristics/risk factors might explain observed relationships in Scotland. The primary objective of this study is to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 by social factors. Secondary objectives are to (1) examine receipt of treatment and prevention of COVID-19 by social factors; (2) quantify ethnic/social differences in adverse COVID-19 outcomes; (3) explore potential mediators of relationships between social factors and SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 prognosis; (4) examine whether occupational COVID-19 differences differ by other social factors and (5) assess quality of ethnicity coding within National Health Service datasets. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use a national cohort comprising the adult population of Scotland who completed the 2011 Census and were living in Scotland on 31 March 2020 (~4.3 million people). Census data will be linked to the Early Assessment of Vaccine and Anti-Viral Effectiveness II cohort consisting of primary/secondary care, laboratory data and death records. Sensitivity/specificity and positive/negative predictive values will be used to assess coding quality of ethnicity. Descriptive statistics will be used to examine differences in treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Poisson/Cox regression analyses and mediation techniques will examine ethnic and social differences, and drivers of inequalities in COVID-19. Effect modification (on additive and multiplicative scales) between key variables (such as ethnicity and occupation) will be assessed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the National Research Ethics Committee, South East Scotland 02. We will present findings of this study at international conferences, in peer-reviewed journals and to policy-makers.","Henery, Paul; Vasileiou, Eleftheria; Hainey, Kirsten J; Buchanan, Duncan; Harrison, Ewen; Leyland, Alastair H; Alexis, Thomas; Robertson, Chris; Agrawal, Utkarsh; Ritchie, Lewis; Stock, Sarah Jane; McCowan, Colin; Docherty, Annemarie; Kerr, Steven; Marple, James; Wood, Rachael; Moore, Emily; Simpson, Colin R; Sheikh, Aziz; Katikireddi, Srinivasa Vittal",BMJ Open,86,0

Dimerization of this enzyme has been shown to be indispensable for transcleavage activity. However, the auto-processing mechanism of M(pro), i.e. its own release from the polyproteins through autocleavage, remains unclear. This study elucidates the relationship between the N-terminal autocleavage activity and the dimerization of “immature” M(pro). Three residues (Arg4, Glu290, and Arg298), which contribute to the active dimer conformation of mature M(pro), are selected for mutational analyses. Surprisingly, all three mutants still perform N-terminal autocleavage, while the dimerization of mature protease and transcleavage activity following auto-processing are completely inhibited by the E290R and R298E mutations and partially so by the R4E mutation. Furthermore, the mature E290R mutant can resume N-terminal autocleavage activity when mixed with the “immature” C145A/E290R double mutant whereas its trans-cleavage activity remains absent. Therefore, the N-terminal auto-processing of M(pro) appears to require only two “immature” monomers approaching one another to form an “intermediate” dimer structure and does not strictly depend on the active dimer conformation existing in mature protease. In conclusion, an auto-release model of M(pro) from the polyproteins is proposed, which will help understand the auto-processing mechanism and the difference between the autocleavage and trans-cleavage proteolytic activities of SARS-CoV M(pro).","Chen, Shuai; Jonas, Felix; Shen, Can; Higenfeld, Rolf",Protein & Cell,86,16

Research Question Is portable chest radiography an effective exclusionary test for future adverse clinical outcomes in patients suspected of COVID-19? Study Design and Methods Charts of consecutive patients suspected of COVID-19 at five emergency departments in New York City between March 19, 2020 through April 23, 2020 were reviewed. Patients were categorized based on absence of findings on initial chest radiography (CXR). The primary outcomes were hospital admission, mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and mortality. Results 3245 adult patients, 474 (14.6%) with a negative initial CXR, were reviewed. Among all patients, a negative initial CXR is associated with a low probability of future adverse clinical outcomes, with negative likelihood ratios of 0.27 (95% CI 0.23-0.31) for hospital admission, 0.24 (95% CI 0.16-0.37) for mechanical ventilation, 0.19 (95% CI 0.09-0.40) for ARDS, and 0.38 (95% CI 0.29-0.51) for mortality. Among the subset of 955 patients younger than 65 years old and with a duration of symptoms of at least 5 days, no patients with a negative CXR died and the negative likelihood ratios were 0.17 (95% CI 0.12-0.25) for hospital admission, 0.09 (95% CI 0.02-0.36) for mechanical ventilation, and 0.09 (95% CI 0.01-0.64) for ARDS. Interpretation Initial chest radiography in adult patients suspected of COVID-19 is a strong exclusionary test for hospital admission, mechanical ventilation, ARDS, and mortality. The value of chest radiography as an exclusionary test for adverse clinical outcomes is highest among young adults, patients with few comorbidities, and those with a prolonged duration of symptoms.","Pagano, Andrew; Finkelstein, Mark; Overbey, Jessica; Steinberger, Sharon; Ellison, Trevor; Manna, Sayan; Toussie, Danielle; Cedillo, Mario; Jacobi, Adam; Gupta, Yogesh S.; Bernheim, Adam; Chung, Michael; Eber, Corey; Fayad, Zahi A.; Concepcion, Jose",Chest,86,21

Although older patients with preexisting chronic illnesses are more prone to develop severe complications, younger, healthy individuals might also exhibit serious manifestations. Previous studies directed to detect genetic susceptibility factors for earlier epidemics have provided evidence of certain protective variations. Following SARS-CoV-2 exposure, viral entry into cells followed by recognition and response by the innate immunity are key determinants of COVID-19 development. In the present review our aim was to conduct a thorough review of the literature on the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as key agents affecting the viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 and innate immunity. Several SNPs within the scope of our approach were found to alter susceptibility to various bacterial and viral infections. Additionally, a multitude of studies confirmed genetic associations between the analyzed genes and autoimmune diseases, underlining the versatile immune consequences of these variants. Based on confirmed associations it is highly plausible that the SNPs affecting viral entry and innate immunity might confer altered susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and its complex clinical consequences. Anticipating several COVID-19 genomic susceptibility loci based on the ongoing genome wide association studies, our review also proposes that a well-established polygenic risk score would be able to clinically leverage the acquired knowledge.","Grolmusz, Vince Kornél; Bozsik, Anikó; Papp, János; Patócs, Attila",Front Immunol,86,1

Most importantly, it has claimed more than half a million lives and is poised to create long and short term consequences through mental health impairment. Identification of important factors affecting mental health can help people manage emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Here, we focus on identifying factors that have a significant impact on mental health during COVID pandemics. In this study, We have used a survey of 17764 adults in the USA at different age groups, genders, and socioeconomic statuses. Through initial statistical analysis followed by Bayesian Network inference, we have identified key factors affecting Mental health during the COVID pandemic. Integrating Bayesian networks with classical machine learning approaches lead to effective modeling of the level of mental health. Overall, females are more stressed than males, and people of age-group 18-29 are more vulnerable to anxiety than other age groups. Using the Bayesian Network Model, we found that people with the chronic medical condition of mental illness are more prone to mental disorders during COVID age. The new realities of working from home, home-schooling, and lack of communication with family/friends/neighbors induces mental pressure. Financial assistance from social security helps in reducing mental stress during COVID generated economic crises. Finally, using supervised ML models, we predicted the most mentally vulnerable people with ~80% accuracy.","Jha, I. P.; Awasthi, R.; Kumar, A.; KUMAR, V.; Sethi, T.",,86,28

This important information provides us a unique opportunity to assess the dose-response relation of the viruses, if reasonable exposure dose could be estimated. Here we developed a simple framework to integrate the a priori dose-response relation for SARS-CoV based on mice experiments, and the recent data on infection risk and viral shedding, to shed light on the dose-response relation for human. The developed dose-response relation is an exponential function with a constant k in the range of 6.19E4 to 7.28E5 virus copies. The result mean that the infection risk caused by one virus copy in viral shedding is about 1.5E-6 to 1.6E-5.

Non-pharmacological public health interventions are the only mode to control diseases in the absence of medication. Objective To find the impact of public health interventions on the epidemiological indicators of disease progression. Methods This is a secondary data analysis done on COVID-19 data. The median doubling time and R0 were calculated for a rolling period of seven days. Interventions were scored from zero to three with an increasing level of stringency. Multivariate linear regression was performed to find the role of individual interventions on R0 and the median doubling time. Results The highest intervention score was reported in the lockdown phase, which gradually decreased to the lowest level of 22. The R0 values settled to a level of 1.25, and the median doubling time increased to 20 days at the end of the study. Public awareness and public health laws were found to be related to both R0 and the median doubling time in the pre-lockdown phase only. Conclusion The implementation of interventions at the ground level is one of the key factors in the success of public health interventions. Post implementation, poor effectiveness of many interventions is evident from the study.

Previous studies exploring CAM use among cancer patients in the Middle East region have shown discrepant results. This study investigates the prevalence and pattern of CAM use by Saudi cancer patients. It also discusses the possible benefits and harm related to CAM use by cancer patients, and it explores the beliefs patients hold and their transparency with health care providers regarding their CAM use. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in oncology wards and outpatient clinics by using face-to-face interviews with the participants. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients with a median age of 50 years (18–84) participated in the study. The prevalence of CAM use was 69.9%; the most prominent types of CAM were those of a religious nature, such as supplication (95.4%), Quran recitation (88.1%), consuming Zamzam water (84.4%), and water upon which the Quran has been read (63.3%). Drinking camel milk was reported by 24.1% of CAM users, whereas camel urine was consumed by 15.7%. A variety of reasons were given for CAM use: 75% reported that they were using CAM to treat cancer, enhance mood (18.3%),control pain (11.9%), enhance the immune system (11%),increase physical fitness (6.4%), and improve appetite (4.6%). Thirty percent of CAM users had discussed the issue with their doctors; only 7.7% had done so with their nurses. CONCLUSIONS: The use of CAM, including camel products, is highly prevalent among cancer patients in the Middle East, but these patients do not necessarily divulge their CAM use to their treating physicians and nurses. Although CAM use can be beneficial, some can be very harmful, especially for cancer patients. Association is known between camel products and brucellosis and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Both can lead to tremendous morbidity in immune-compromised patients. Doctor–patient communication regarding CAM use is of paramount importance in cancer care.

To be invited to complete the questionnaire, participants had to have registered to take the University Clinical Admissions Test (UCAT) in 2019 and to have agreed to be invited to take part in the study, or they needed to have completed one or more previous UKMACS questionnaires. They also need to have been seriously considering applying to study medicine in the UK for entry in 2020 between May and October 2019, and be resident in the UK or Islands/Crown Dependencies. Main outcome measures Views on calculated grades, views on potential changes to medical school admissions and teaching in 2020 and 2021, reported experiences of education following the closure of educational institutions in March 2020. Results Respondents had concerns about the calculated grades that will replace A-level examinations, especially female applicants and applicants from Black Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds who felt teachers would find it difficult to grade and rank students accurately, as well as those from non-selective state schools and those living in deprived areas who had some concerns about the grade standardisation process. Calculated grades were not considered fair enough by a majority to use in the acceptance or rejection of medical offer-holders, but several measures - including interview and aptitude test scores - were considered fair enough to use in combination. Respondents from non-selective state (public) schools reported less use of and less access to educational resources compared to their counterparts at private/selective schools. In particular they reported less online teaching in real time, and reported spending less time studying during the lockdown. Conclusions The coronavirus pandemic will have significant and long term impacts on the selection, education and performance of our future medical workforce.

There were no hallo signs, reversed hallo signs, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary changes were unilateral in 16.7% and bilateral in 83.3%, central in 14.6%, peripheral in 57.3%, and diffuse (central and peripheral) in 28.1%. Most cases showed multi- lobar changes (70.8%), while the lower lobe was more commonly involved (17.7%) than the middle lobe/lingula (8.3%) and upper lobe (3.1%). In unilateral involvement, changes were more on the right (68.8%) than the left (31.2%) side. Compared with middle and old age groups, young adult patients showed significantly lesser frequency of consolidation (17% vs. 13.3% and 37%), diffuse changes 28.1% (14.2% vs. 35.3% and 40.5%), bilateral disease (71.4% vs. 94.1% and 85.2%), and multi-lobar involvement (51.4% vs. 82.4% and 81.4%) respectively. CONCLUSION: Bilateral and peripheral GGO were the most frequent findings with the right and lower lobar predilection. The pattern and the distribution of CT changes seem to be age-specific.","Sultan, Omar Muayad; Alghazali, Dhia Mahdey; Al-Tameemi, Haider; Abed, Mohammed; Hawiji, Dhaffer Abdullah; Abu Ghniem, Muthana Naser; Al-Obaidi, Laith; Abedtwfeq, Raad Hefdhi",Curr Med Imaging,86,29

We conducted a survey on age-specific social contact patterns to assess effects of physical distancing measures and used a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to simulate the epidemic. Because multiple distancing measures were implemented simultaneously, we assessed their overall effects and the contribution of each measure. Before measures were implemented, the estimated basic reproduction number (R(0)) was 2.38 (95% CI 2.01–2.80). During lockdown, daily contacts decreased by 86.9% and R(0) decreased by 81.0% (95% credible interval [CrI] 71.8%–86.0%); each distancing measure decreased R(0 )by 10%–24%. By April 26, the attack rate in Greece was 0.12% (95% CrI 0.06%–0.26%), one of the lowest in Europe, and the infection fatality ratio was 1.12% (95% CrI 0.55%–2.31%).

There is a dire need for novel effective antivirals to treat COVID-19, as the only approved direct-acting antiviral to date is remdesivir, targeting the viral polymerase complex. A potential alternate target in the viral life cycle is the main SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CLpro (Mpro). The drug candidate PF-00835231 is the active compound of the first anti-3CLpro regimen in clinical trials. Here, we perform a comparative analysis of PF-00835231, the pre-clinical 3CLpro inhibitor GC-376, and the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, in alveolar basal epithelial cells modified to express ACE2 (A549+ACE2 cells). We find PF-00835231 with at least similar or higher potency than remdesivir or GC-376. A time-of-drug-addition approach delineates the timing of early SARS-CoV-2 life cycle steps in A549+ACE2 cells and validates PF-00835231’s early time of action. In a model of the human polarized airway epithelium, both PF-00835231 and remdesivir potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations. Finally, we show that the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein, which was previously suggested to diminish PF-00835231’s efficacy based on experiments in monkey kidney Vero E6 cells, does not negatively impact PF-00835231 efficacy in either A549+ACE2 cells or human polarized airway epithelial cultures. Thus, our study provides in vitro evidence for the potential of PF-00835231 as an effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral and addresses concerns that emerged based on prior studies in non-human in vitro models. Importance The arsenal of SARS-CoV-2 specific antiviral drugs is extremely limited. Only one direct-acting antiviral drug is currently approved, the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, and it has limited efficacy. Thus, there is a substantial need to develop additional antiviral compounds with minimal side effects and alternate viral targets. One such alternate target is its main protease, 3CLpro (Mpro), an essential component of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle processing the viral polyprotein into the components of the viral polymerase complex. In this study, we characterize a novel antiviral drug, PF-00835231, which is the active component of the first-in-class 3CLpro-targeting regimen in clinical trials. Using 3D in vitro models of the human airway epithelium, we demonstrate the antiviral potential of PF-00835231 for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.","de Vries, Maren; Mohamed, Adil S; Prescott, Rachel A; Valero-Jimenez, Ana M; Desvignes, Ludovic; O’Connor, Rebecca; Steppan, Claire; Devlin, Joseph C; Ivanova, Ellie; Herrera, Alberto; Schinlever, Austin; Loose, Paige; Ruggles, Kelly; Koralov, Sergei B; Anderson, Annaliesa S.; Binder, Joseph; Dittmann, Meike",bioRxiv,86,16

These differences are likely due to gender-specific behaviors, genetic and hormonal factors, and sex differences in biological pathways related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several social, behavioral and comorbid factors are implicated in the generally worse outcomes in men as compared with women. Underlying biological sex differences and their effects on COVID-19 outcomes, however, have received less attention. The present review summarizes the available literature regarding proposed molecular and cellular markers of COVID-19 infection, their associations with health outcomes, and any reported modification by sex. Biological sex differences characterized by such biomarkers exist within healthy populations and also differ with age- and sex-specific conditions, such as pregnancy and menopause. In the context of COVID-19, descriptive biomarker levels are often reported by sex, but data pertaining to the effect of patient sex on the relationship between biomarkers and COVID-19 disease severity/outcomes are scarce. Such biomarkers may offer plausible explanations for the worse COVID-19 outcomes seen in men. There is the need for larger studies with sex-specific reporting and robust analyses to elucidate how sex modifies cellular and molecular pathways associated with SARS-CoV-2. This will improve interpretation of biomarkers and clinical management of COVID-19 patients by facilitating a personalized medical approach to risk stratification, prevention, and treatment.","Haitao, Tu; Vermunt, Jane; Abeykoon, Jithma; Ghamrawi, Ranine; Gunaratne, Madugodaralalage; Jayachandran, Muthuvel; Narang, Kavita; Parashuram, Santosh; Suvakov, Sonja; Garovic, Vesna",Mayo Clin Proc,86,16

No research has empirically validated declines in surgical volume in Japan, based on the usage of surgical triage. We aimed to identify whether the announcement of surgical priorities by each Japanese surgical society may have affected the surgical volume decline during the 1st wave of this pandemic. METHODS: We extracted 490,719 available cases of patients aged > 15 years who underwent elective major surgeries between July 1, 2018, and June 30, 2020. After the categorization of surgical specialities, we calculated descriptive statistics to compare the year-over-year trend and conducted an interrupted time series analysis to validate the decline of each surgical procedure. RESULTS: Monthly surgical cases of eight surgical specialities, especially ophthalmology and ear/nose/throat surgeries, decreased from April 2020 and reached a minimum in May 2020. An interrupted time series analysis showed no significant trends in oncological and critical surgeries.

Now in the 21st century in the post-antibiotic era, the miracle is turning into a nightmare, due to the growing problem of the resistance of microorganisms to classic antimicrobials and the non-investment by the pharmaceutical industry in new antimicrobial agents. Unfortunately, the current COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the global risks associated with uncontrolled infections and the various forms of impact that such a pandemic may have on the economy and on social habits besides the associated morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is an urgent need to recycle classic antibiotics, as is the case in the use of ionic liquids (ILs) based on antibiotics. Thus, the aim of the present review is to summarize the data on ILs, mainly those with antimicrobial action and especially against resistant strains. The main conclusions of this article are that ILs are flexible due to their ability to modulate cations and anions as a salt, making it possible to combine the properties of both and multiplying the activity of separate cations and anions. Also, these compounds have low cost methods of production, which makes it highly attractive to explore them, especially as antimicrobial agents and against resistant strains. ILs may further be combined with other therapeutic strategies, such as phage or lysine therapy, enhancing the therapeutic arsenal needed to fight this worldwide problem of antibacterial resistance. Thus, the use of ILs as antibiotics by themselves or together with phage therapy and lysine therapy are promising alternatives against pathogenic microorganisms, and may have the possibility to be used in new ways in order to restrain uncontrolled infections.","Prudêncio, Cristina; Vieira, Mónica; Van der Auweraer, Seppe; Ferraz, Ricardo",Antibiotics (Basel),86,1

This poses a significant challenge to coordinated international efforts in global surveillance and infection control. Significantly, respiratory viral infections, spread mostly via droplet transmission, are extremely contagious and have caused significant morbidity and mortality during outbreaks in the last decade. Molecular diagnostics via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been key in the rapid diagnosis of most of these viral infections. However, a high index of suspicion and early institution of appropriate isolation measures remain as the mainstay in the control and containment of the spread of these viral infections. Although treatment for most of the viral infections remains supportive, efficacious antiviral agents against influenza infections exist. The infections discussed in this chapter include those first described in the 2000s: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and metapneumovirus and rhinovirus C as well as those that have been described in the past but have reemerged in the last decade in outbreaks resulting in significant morbidity and mortality, including adenovirus, influenza virus, and enterovirus D68 (EV-D68).","Tambyah, Paul; Isa, Mas Suhaila; Tan, Christelle Xian-Ting",Kendig's Disorders of the Respiratory Tract in Children,86,16

In the present work, mRNA-based nanomedicinal products based on solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) were developed in order to produce IL-10 to treat corneal inflammation. mRNA encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) or human IL-10 was complexed with different SLNs and ligands. After, physicochemical characterization, transfection efficacy, intracellular disposition, cellular uptake and IL-10 expression of the nanosystems were evaluated in vitro in human corneal epithelial (HCE-2) cells. Energy-dependent mechanisms favoured HCE-2 transfection, whereas protein production was influenced by energy-independent uptake mechanisms. Nanovectors with a mean particle size between 94 and 348 nm and a positive superficial charge were formulated as eye drops containing 1% (w/v) of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with 7.1–7.5 pH. After three days of topical administration to mice, all formulations produced GFP in the corneal epithelium of mice. SLNs allowed the obtaining of a higher transfection efficiency than naked mRNA.

The objective of this article is to study how this adaptation among university teachers affected their job performance due to the technostress (objective and subjective) that they may have suffered. Based on the person-environment misfit theory (P-E fit theory), the sample consisted of 239 teachers from face-to-face and online universities in Spain who were asked to identify the type of technostress, feelings of technostress, and impact on job performance as a result of online teaching due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that teachers who suffered the most from the negative consequences of technology have been female teachers from face-to-face universities who are older, have more years of experience, and consequently, hold a higher position. Despite previous results none of the above variables have been significant in explaining the decline in job performance during confinement. It was also observed that although the effect on job performance was similar for online teachers as well as face-to-face teachers, the variables that explained this effect were different. For the online teachers, there was a misfit between the demands and resources, which are explained based on the previous theory (P-E fit theory). Teachers from face-to-face universities pointed to the lack of instructions from their organization, along with subjective feelings of techno-inefficacy, as the reasons behind the decline in job performance during the lockdown period. Looking ahead to future research on the incorporation of information and communications technology in teaching work, it is necessary to consider variables associated with technostress, both objective and subjective, in order to increase the effectiveness of integrating emerging technology into teaching work.","Penado Abilleira, Maria; Rodicio-García, María-Luisa; Ríos-de Deus, María Paula; Mosquera-González, Maria José",Front Psychol,86,20

Some of these host proteins are enclosed within the virion structure, while others, in the case of enveloped viruses, are embedded in the host-derived membrane. While many of these host protein incorporations are likely accidental, some may play a role in virus infectivity, replication and/or immunoreactivity in the next host. Host protein incorporations may be especially important in therapeutic applications where large numbers of virus particles are administered. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is the prototypic rhabdovirus and a candidate vaccine, gene therapy and oncolytic vector. Using mass spectrometry, we previously examined cell type dependent host protein content of VSV virions using intact (“whole”) virions purified from three cell lines originating from different species. Here we aimed to determine the localization of host proteins within the VSV virions by analyzing: i) whole VSV virions; and ii) whole VSV virions treated with Proteinase K to remove all proteins outside the viral envelope. A total of 257 proteins were identified, with 181 identified in whole virions and 183 identified in Proteinase K treated virions. Most of these proteins have not been previously shown to be associated with VSV. Functional enrichment analysis indicated the most overrepresented categories were proteins associated with vesicles, vesicle-mediated transport and protein localization. Using western blotting, the presence of several host proteins, including some not previously shown in association with VSV (such as Yes1, Prl1 and Ddx3y), was confirmed and their relative quantities in various virion fractions determined. Our study provides a valuable inventory of virion-associated host proteins for further investigation of their roles in the replication cycle, pathogenesis and immunoreactivity of VSV.","Moerdyk-Schauwecker, Megan; Hwang, Sun-Il; Grdzelishvili, Valery Z.",PLoS One,86,1

We built a modeling tool to aid practicing public health officials with estimating healthcare demand from the pandemic in their jurisdictions and to evaluate the potential impacts of population-wide social-distancing interventions. METHODS: The tool uses a SEIR compartmental model to project the pandemic’s local spread. Users input case counts, healthcare resources, and select intervention strategies to evaluate. Outputs include the number of infections and deaths with and without intervention, and the demand for hospital and critical care beds and ventilators relative to existing capacity. We illustrate the tool using data from three regions of Chile. RESULTS: Our scenarios indicate a surge in COVID-19 patients could overwhelm Chilean hospitals by June, peaking in July or August at 6 to 50 times the current supply of beds and ventilators. A lockdown strategy or combination of case isolation, home quarantine, social distancing of individuals >70 years, and telework interventions may keep treatment demand below capacity.

METHODS: The present case-control study was conducted at tertiary care hospital, AIIMS, Patna, Bihar, India. Total 156 cases and 204 controls were enrolled in the study after obtaining informed consent. Categorization of the patients were done based on clinical severity and level of Vitamin D. The association between these categories with different variables were analyzed using regression analysis and other statistical tests. RESULTS: The status of Vitamin D (optimal, mild to moderate deficiency and severe deficiency) differed significantly among cases and controls. Diabetes and hypertension were most prevalent comorbidities among cases. On regression analysis, the difference in Vitamin D level was significant (aOR, 3.295; 95%CI, 1.25–8.685). The association between Vitamin D status and clinical severity group was statistically significant among cases. Among all variables, age, diabetes, hypertension and clinical severity were associated with worst outcome.

The influence of different substrates (i.e., fibronectin, gelatin, laminin) and the impact of a three‐dimensional/two‐dimensional (3D/2D) culture switch on the biology of LPCs isolated as lung spheroids (LSs) from normal adult human lung biopsy specimens were investigated. We applied a spheroid culture system as the selective/inductive step for progenitor cell culture, as described in many biological systems. The data showed a niche‐like proepithelial microenvironment inside the LS, highly sensitive to the 3D culture system and significantly affecting the phenotype of adult LPCs more than culture substrate. LSs favor epithelial phenotypes and LPC maintenance and contain cells more responsive to specific commitment stimuli than 2D monolayer cultures, while secreting a distinctive set of paracrine factors. We have shown for the first time, to our knowledge, how culture as 3D LSs can affect LPC epithelial phenotype and produce strong paracrine signals with a distinctive secretomic profile compared with 2D monolayer conditions. These findings suggest novel approaches to maintain ex vivo LPCs for basic and translational studies.

Pasteur's early approaches to vaccine development, attenuation and inactivation, are even now the two poles of vaccine technology. Today, purification of microbial elements, genetic engineering and improved knowledge of immune protection allow direct creation of attenuated mutants, expression of vaccine proteins in live vectors, purification and even synthesis of microbial antigens, and induction of a variety of immune responses through manipulation of DNA, RNA, proteins and polysaccharides. Both noninfectious and infectious diseases are now within the realm of vaccinology. The profusion of new vaccines enables new populations to be targeted for vaccination, and requires the development of routes of administration additional to injection.

CaKV was first described in fecal samples from diarrheic dogs in the USA in 2011, with subsequent reports in the UK, Italy, South Korea, China, Tanzania, and Japan. CaKV is frequently identified in feces of animals with or without clinical signs of gastroenteritis. The present study investigated the presence of CaKV in fecal samples from 53 diarrheic dogs from Londrina, southern Brazil. Using a RT-PCR assay, CaKV RNA was identified in three dogs, resulting in an overall occurrence rate of 5.7%. In addition, coinfection with canine parvovirus subtype 2b was detected in all CaKV-positive diarrheic fecal samples. Using a phylogenetic analysis based on the VP1 gene sequence, the Brazilian CaKV field strains were found to be very similar to a previously identified CaKV strain from Brazil that was found in the tissue of a puppy and were also found to be clustered with other CaKV strains detected worldwide and other kobuvirus strains identified in mouse, feline, and human hosts.","Miyabe, Flavia Megumi; Ribeiro, Juliane; Alfieri, Alice Fernandes; Alfieri, Amauri Alcindo",Braz J Microbiol,86,29

Adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) is an autoinflammatory disease characterized by life-threatening complications. Systemic hyperinflammation and cytokine storm play a critical role in the pathogenesis of both COVID-19 and AOSD. We aimed to compare the similarities and differences focusing on ferritin and cytokine levels between severe COVID-19 and active AOSD. A literature search was performed using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science to collect the levels of cytokine including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-α, IL-10, and ferritin in severe COVID-19 patients. After extracting available data of indicators of interest, we acquired these statistics with a single-arm meta-analysis. Furthermore, a comparison was conducted between 52 patients with active AOSD in our center and severe COVID-19 patients from databases. The levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were higher in severe COVID-19 compared with those in active AOSD. There were no significant differences on the cytokine of IL-1β and TNF-α. Fold changes of IL-18 were defined as the mean expression level ratio of severe COVID-19 to healthy controls in the COVID-19 study and active AOSD to healthy controls in our study, individually. Although the fold change of IL-18 in patients with AOSD was significantly higher than patients with severe COVID-19 (fold change: 594.00 vs 2.17), there was no statistical comparability. In addition, the level of ferritin was higher in active AOSD in comparison with severe COVID-19. Our findings suggest that severe COVID-19 and active AOSD have differences in cytokine panel and ferritin level, indicating the pathogenic role of ferritin in overwhelming inflammation. And it paves the way to make efficacy therapeutic strategy targeting the hyperinflammatory process in COVID-19 according to AOSD management, especially in severe COVID-19.","Meng, Jianfen; Ma, Yuning; Jia, Jinchao; Wang, Mengyan; Teng, Jialin; Shi, Hui; Liu, Honglei; Su, Yutong; Ye, Junna; Sun, Yue; Cheng, Xiaobing; Chi, Huihui; Liu, Tingting; Zhu, Dehao; Zhou, Zhuochao; Wan, Liyan; Wang, Zhihong; Wang, Fan; Qiao, Xin; Chen, Xia; Zhang, Hao; Tang, Zihan; Yang, Chengde; Hu, Qiongyi",Front Immunol,86,18

We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing vedolizumab to placebo in patients with IBD. Outcomes were the rate of respiratory tract infections (RTI), upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) among patients receiving vedolizumab as compared with placebo. Pooled rates were reported as Odds Ratios (OR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI). Eight RCT involving 3,287 patients (1873 CD and 1415 UC) were analyzed; 2,493 patients received vedolizumab and 794 received placebo. The rates of RTI and URTI were statistically higher in vedolizumab-treated patients compared to placebo [OR = 1.63; 95% CI (1.07–2.49); OR = 1.64 95% CI (1.07–2.53) respectively].

Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a convenient tool for detection of COVID-19 pneumonia. Identifying SARS-CoV-2 infected outpatients with pulmonary disease may be important for early risk stratification. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence, natural history and clinical significance of pulmonary disease in outpatients with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive outpatients (CV(+)) were assessed with LUS to identify the presence of interstitial pneumonia. Studies were considered positive based on the presence of B-lines, pleural irregularity and consolidations. A subset of patients underwent longitudinal examinations. Correlations between LUS findings and patient symptoms, demographics, comorbidities and clinical outcomes over 8 weeks were evaluated. RESULTS: 102 CV(+) patients underwent LUS with 42 (41%) demonstrating pulmonary involvement. Baseline LUS severity scores correlated with shortness of breath on multivariate analysis. Of the CV(+) patients followed longitudinally, a majority showed improvement or resolution in LUS findings after 1–2 weeks. Only one patient in the CV(+) cohort was briefly hospitalised, and no patient died or required mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: We found a high prevalence of LUS findings in outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the pervasiveness of pulmonary disease across a broad spectrum of LUS severity scores and lack of adverse outcomes, our findings suggest that LUS may not be a useful as a risk stratification tool in SARS-CoV-2 in the general outpatient population.","Fairchild, Robert M; Horomanski, Audra; Mar, Diane A; Triant, Gabriela R; Lu, Rong; Lu, Di; Guo, Haiwei Henry; Baker, Matthew C",BMJ Open Respir Res,86,17

Five RAM variables were assessed: physical activity duration, step count, active energy expenditure, metabolic equivalents and a composite RAM score incorporating all four variables. Other assessments every six months included EDSS, MSFC, MSIS-29, Chalder Fatigue Scale and Beck’s Depression Inventory. Annualized brain atrophy was measured using SIENA. RESULTS: RAM was tolerated well by people with MS; the device was worn 99.4% of the time. RAM had good convergent and divergent validity and was responsive, especially with respect to step count. Measurement of physical activity over one day was as responsive as six days. The composite RAM score positively correlated with brain volume loss.

There is an urgent need to understand this new virus and develop prophylactic and therapeutic drugs. Since drug development is an expensive, intense and time-consuming path, timely repurposing of the existing drugs is often explored wherein the research avenues including genomics, bioinformatics, molecular modeling approaches offer valuable strengths. Here, we have examined the binding potential of Withaferin-A (Wi-A), Withanone (Wi-N) (active withanolides of Ashwagandha) and Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester (CAPE, bioactive ingredient of propolis) to a highly conserved protein, M(pro) of SARS-CoV-2. We found that Wi-N and CAPE, but not Wi-A, bind to the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) with efficacy and binding energies equivalent to an already claimed N3 protease inhibitor. Similar to N3 inhibitor, Wi-N and CAPE were interacting with the highly conserved residues of the proteases of coronaviruses. The binding stability of these molecules was further analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations. The binding free energies calculated using MM/GBSA for N3 inhibitor, CAPE and Wi-N were also comparable. Data presented here predicted that these natural compounds may possess the potential to inhibit the functional activity of SARS-CoV-2 protease (an essential protein for virus survival), and hence (i) may connect to save time and cost required for designing/development, and initial screening for anti-COVID drugs, (ii) may offer some therapeutic value for the management of novel fatal coronavirus disease, (iii) warrants prioritized further validation in the laboratory and clinical tests.

The perceived threat of COVID-19 has the potential to cause severe psychological maladjustment. The aim of the study is to explore Spanish radiographers’ concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study was quantitative, observational and cross-sectional. The sample was made up of 546 radiographers working in Spain during the outbreak. The instrument used for analysis was an ad hoc questionnaire with socio-demographic questions and the questionnaire on perception of threat from COVID-19 validate to spanish healthcare professionals. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 70.1% of female, 29.7% of male and 0.2% undeclare sex participants. The results showed a high level of a perceived threat from COVID-19 (7.57 ± 0.088), furthermore we observed a high level of threat about the possibility of infecting family members (8.49 ± 0.25), patients (8.33 ± 0.086), and coworkers (8.35 ± 0.084). Furthermore, females have a higher level of a perception of threat to spread infection between patients (r = −0.136; p = 0.001) and coworkers (r = −0.118; p = 0.006), than males. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic is perceived as a serious threat, being especially concerned about the threat of spreading the infection to family, coworkers, and patients. The perception of risk depends partly on professionals’ gender and family responsibilities.

We have previously reported that antibodies elicited by a SARS-CoV vaccine candidate based on recombinant, full-length SARS-CoV Spike-protein trimers, trigger infection of immune cell lines. These observations prompted us to investigate the molecular mechanisms and responses to antibody-mediated infection in human macrophages. METHODS: We have used primary human immune cells to evaluate their susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV in the presence of anti-Spike antibodies. Fluorescence microscopy and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were utilized to assess occurrence and consequences of infection. To gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanism, we performed mutational analysis with a series of truncated and chimeric constructs of fragment crystallizable γ receptors (FcγR), which bind antibody-coated pathogens. RESULTS: We show here that anti-Spike immune serum increased infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages by replication-competent SARS-CoV as well as Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles (SARS-CoVpp). Macrophages infected with SARS-CoV, however, did not support productive replication of the virus. Purified anti-viral IgGs, but not other soluble factor(s) from heat-inactivated mouse immune serum, were sufficient to enhance infection. Antibody-mediated infection was dependent on signaling-competent members of the human FcγRII family, which were shown to confer susceptibility to otherwise naïve ST486 cells, as binding of immune complexes to cell surface FcγRII was necessary but not sufficient to trigger antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. Furthermore, only FcγRII with intact cytoplasmic signaling domains were competent to sustain ADE of SARS-CoVpp infection, thus providing additional information on the role of downstream signaling by FcγRII. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that human macrophages can be infected by SARS-CoV as a result of IgG-mediated ADE and indicate that this infection route requires signaling pathways activated downstream of binding to FcγRII receptors.","Yip, Ming Shum; Leung, Nancy Hiu Lan; Cheung, Chung Yan; Li, Ping Hung; Lee, Horace Hok Yeung; Daëron, Marc; Peiris, Joseph Sriyal Malik; Bruzzone, Roberto; Jaume, Martial",Virol J,86,16

Data on safety and efficacy are lacking. Healthcare professionals cannot wait for published randomised controlled trials before they can start these rehabilitative interventions in daily clinical practice, as the number of post-COVID-19 patients increases rapidly. The Convergence of Opinion on Recommendations and Evidence process was used to make interim recommendation for the rehabilitation in the hospital and post-hospital phase in COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 patients, respectively. METHODS: 93 experts were asked to fill out 13 multiple choice questions. Agreement of directionality was tabulated for each question. At least 70% agreement on directionality was necessary to make consensus suggestions. RESULTS: 76 experts (82%) reached consensus on all questions based upon indirect evidence and clinical experience on the need for early rehabilitation during the hospital admission, the screening for treatable traits with rehabilitation in all patients at discharge and 6–8 weeks after discharge, and around the content of rehabilitation for these patients. It advocates for assessment of oxygen needs at discharge and more comprehensive assessment of rehabilitation needs including physical as well as mental aspects 6–8 weeks after discharge.

Its impact is attested to by the number of research studies on it. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the psychology of sustainability (quality of life), on sustainable development, and on the global economy. A computerized literature search was performed, and journal articles from authentic sources were extracted, including MEDLINE (PubMed), Google Scholar, Science Direct, ProQuest, and Emerald Insight. The references in selected articles were screened to identify any relevant studies. The following inclusion criteria were followed: research articles based on the COVID-19 pandemic, and articles, research papers, journals, and news articles published 2010 to 2020. The exclusion criteria were as follow: psychology research, articles, and journals published before 2010 and research articles having no link with the current pandemic’s impact on the psychology of sustainability, quality of life, and the global economy. Of the initial 350 articles identified, only 61 studies were found to be relevant and meet the inclusion criteria. Based on these articles, the review highlights that compared to developed countries, the developing nations and poor nations such as African countries with compromised health structures have been greatly affected. There are close associations between health, economic, environmental, and political issues globally. The pandemic can be managed if we follow new policies that implement economic and public health changes worldwide. A planned, coordinated approach between the public-private sector is required, designed according to each country’s health system and economy. We can come out of this crisis if we work together and support both developed and developing nations.","El Keshky, Mogeda El Sayed; Basyouni, Sawzan Sadaqa; Al Sabban, Abeer Mohammad",Front Psychol,86,24

Orthopnoea and paradoxical abdominal respiration were identified. Phrenic paralysis, demonstrated by examination of patient breathing, and on x-ray while standing breathing in and out, explained the respiratory distress. This is a rare and previously undescribed neurological complication of COVID-19 infection caused by vagus nerve injury. LEARNING POINTS: Phrenic paralysis must be kept in mind as a rare neurological complication of COVID-19. Vagus nerve palsy is a neurological manifestation as anosmia and dysgeusia, that were already identified in the olfactory system of COVID-19 patients.","Maurier, Francois; Godbert, Benoit; Perrin, Julie",Eur J Case Rep Intern Med,86,1

Hematologic and cardiovascular involvement of COVID-19 causes thromboembolic events across multiple organs which mainly manifest as venous thromboembolism, and rarely, peripheral arterial thromboembolic events. In-situ thrombosis of a healthy, non-atherosclerotic native artery is rare, and COVID-19 has been reported to be a cause of this phenomenon. We aimed to report our institutional experience with COVID-19 patients who developed acute limb ischemia (ALI) during hospitalization or after discharge. METHODS: This was a single-center cross-sectional study. Records of all patients ≥18 years of age admitted to a tertiary center with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection between September 1 and December 31, 2020 were retrospectively examined. Data regarding patient demographics, co-morbidities and outcomes were collected. Patients were followed-up during index hospitalization and for 30 days postdischarge. Acute limb ischemia was diagnosed by means of duplex ultrasound and computed tomography angiography in the presence of a clinical suspicion. RESULTS: A total of 681 consecutive patients (38.5% women) were hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 during the study period. Median age was 63 years (IQR, 52–74). In-hospital mortality occurred in 94 (13.8%) patients. Ninety (13.2%) patients required intensive care unit admission at some point of their hospital stay. Six (0.9%) patients (one woman) with a median age of 62 years experienced ALI (IQR, 59–64.3). All patients were receiving low molecular weight heparin when they developed ALI. The median of duration between COVID-19 diagnosis and ALI symptom onset was 13 days (IQR, 11.3–14). Three patients underwent emergent surgical thrombectomy combined with systemic anticoagulation, and 3 received systemic anticoagulation alone. Two patients with ALI did not survive to hospital discharge. Among survivors, 1 patient underwent bilateral major amputations, and another underwent a minor amputation within 1 month of hospital discharge. Symptoms of ALI completely resolved in 2 patients without sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is a multisystemic disorder with involvement of hematologic and cardiovascular systems. Despite widespread use of thromboprophylaxis, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk of ALI, and subsequent limb loss or even death.","Topcu, Ahmet Can; Ozturk-Altunyurt, Gozde; Akman, Dilara; Batirel, Ayse; Demirhan, Recep",Ann Vasc Surg,86,24

With the instantaneous change in work environment forcing Americans to adapt to working at home, many theorize that women will be more adversely affected due to traditional concepts of women being more responsible for the home in addition to work responsibilities. Objective: Understand how women contributed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) literature early in the pandemic. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of manuscripts published in three high-impact U.S. medical journals from February to May 2020 was performed. We used log-binomial regression to examine for an association between COVID-19 status and likelihood of having at least one female first author, and evaluated for effect modification according to whether the manuscript was invited. Results: Among 980 manuscripts, 313 (31.9%) listed at least one female first author, 203 were written on COVID-19 (20.7%), and 144 (14.7%) were invited. There was no association between COVID-19 status and having at least one female first author overall (adjusted risk ratio [RR] 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–1.19). The relationship between COVID-19 status and first-author sex was 0.23 (95% CI 0.06–0.92) for invited manuscripts and 1.04 (95% CI 0.81–1.35) for noninvited manuscripts (p for interaction 0.02). Discussion: We demonstrate that women were not less likely to be first authors on COVID-19 manuscripts but were less likely to be first authors on invited COVID-19 manuscripts. Early career female researchers are the most vulnerable for inability to meet metrics for promotion, accounting for the continued under-representation of women in senior academic roles. COVID-19 has the potential to exacerbate this disparity.","Brown, Cristal; Novick, Tessa K.; Jacobs, Elizabeth A.",Womens Health Rep (New Rochelle),86,21

The TFF model of second grade fluid is represented with nonlinear second-order differential system. The aim of the present work is to exploit the cubic spline approach (CSA) to transform the differential equations for TFF model into an equivalent set of nonlinear equations. The approximation in mean squared error sense is introduced for the formulation of cost function for solving the nonlinear system of equations representing TFF model. The optimization of the decision variables of the cost function is carried out with global search efficacy of evolution by genetic algorithms (GAs) integrated with sequential quadratic programming (SQP) for speedy adjustments. The designed spline–evolutionary computing paradigm, CSA–GA–SQP, is evaluated for different scenarios of TFF model by variation of second grade and magnetic parameters, as well as variation in the length of splines. Results endorsed the worth of CSA–GA–SQP solver as an efficient alternative, reliable, stable, and accurate framework for the variants of nonlinear TFF systems on the basis of multiple autonomous executions. The design computing spline paradigm CSA–GA–SQP is a promising alternative numerical solver to be implemented for the solution of stiff nonlinear systems representing the complex scenarios of computational fluid dynamics problems.","Rizwan, Aamir; Ahmad, Iftikhar; Raja, Muhammad Asif Zahoor; Shoaib, Muhammad",Arab J Sci Eng,86,9

During the pandemic, pharmacy professionals (PPs) in India have continued to provide medications, supplies and services. India's public-private healthcare system is complex and of variable quality. Lacunae in pharmacy education, training, and lack of resolution around pharmacist roles present challenges in providing health services to patients. Such lack of differentiation creates challenges around role specifications and appropriate placement of PPs in patient care and on EP&R task forces or representation at the policy level. This study aimed to gain rapid insights from PPs in India regarding their roles and preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey comprising 20 questions regarding EP&R and Operations management was developed using the Qualtrics® survey software and administered to a sample of PPs. Survey results indicate that PPs were actively involved in essential pharmacy services despite minimal EP&R training. Based on lessons learned during COVID-19, lacunae in knowledge, training and regulations were identified and recommendations are provided to broaden PP roles and enable them to be better prepared and actively engaged in EP&R for future emergencies.","Meghana, Aruru; Aparna, Yerramilli; Chandra, Sekar M.; Sanjeev, Sharma",Res Social Adm Pharm,86,16
