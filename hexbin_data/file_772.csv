23692,Other Allergic Skin Disorders,2008,"Two- to three-months-old pigs infected with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus showed no clinical response when housed at 30°C, but comparable infected pigs exposed to temperature changes from 30°C to 4°C following infection showed typical signs of TGE. Development of TGE-specific immune responses, as measured by blastogenic response of tissue lymphocytes, occurred at 3 days post-inoculation (DPI) in pigs held at 30°C, but not until 7 DPI in infected pigs held under the adverse conditions. Immunosuppression with corticosteroids resulted in a fall in circulatory T cells, lowering of non-specific blastogenic response of circulatory lymphocytes, and clinical signs of disease when immunosuppressed pigs were infected with TGE virus and held at 30°C. It is suggested that clinical responses to TGE virus infection may be affected by the influence of ambient temperatures on the immune responses of pigs.","Shimizu, M.; Shimizu, Y.",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117185/,772

In order to do so, the article sketches pre-ILO legal doctrine, and discusses the creation and particular structure of the ILO at some length: why even create an organization to address labour issues, instead of concluding a convention? This is followed by outlining just how relevant the role of the ILO has been.","Klabbers, Jan",International Labour Organization and Global Social Governance,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7562824/,772
47539,Evaluation of Coronavirus Covid-19’s Impact on Malaysian-Based Global Companies,2021-02-01,"Much has been written about the Internet of Things (hence IoT). Some sources are more about promoting IoT as their next big feature; other sources seem to suggest IoT is something everyone needs to learn or be left behind. Fortunately, books and similar media avoid the sales pitch to expand on the science and technology for implementing and managing the data for IoT, while other texts concentrate on the future or the inevitable evolution of our society as we become more connected to the world around us each and every day. However, you need not dive into such tomes or be able to recite rhetoric to get started with the IoT. In fact, through the efforts of many companies, including Microsoft, you can explore the IoT without intensive training or expensive hardware and software.","Bell, Charles",Windows 10 for the Internet of Things,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972063/,772

47543,"Artificial Intelligence and Coronavirus COVID-19: Applications, Impact and Future Implications",2021-02-01,"Blue procurement models may come in several different structures. First, is the structure of obtaining marine aquarium products which are sustainable and beneficial to local communities. Second, is the structure of obtaining reef-dependent seafood that has been independently verified against a sustainability certification such as the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). Third, is working with small-scale fisheries which may be subsistence-based and/or have a commercial aspect. Relatedly, a fourth potential form of blue procurement is the establishment of concessions, such as conservation concessions or community-managed concessions, which produce sustainably sourced products. The author presents an historical overview, provides more details on the instrument’s mechanisms, outlines the size of the instrument, presents four case studies, and then undertakes both a financial analysis and a policy analysis, along with a future outlook. The four case studies are: LINI’s Sustainable Ornamental Fish Aquaculture; Western Australia’s MSC-Certified Rock Lobster Fishery; Rare’s Fish Forever Work in the Philippines and Indonesia; and Blue Ventures’ work in Madagascar. LINI is based in Bali, Indonesia and uses the sustainable capture of reef fishes as a driver of stewardship, including the Banggai cardinalfish. The Western Australia Rock Lobster Fishery was the first Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified fishery in the world. The Western Rock Lobster is Western Australia’s most valuable fishery and historically was Australia’s most valuable single species wild capture fishery. Rare, a global nonprofit organization, has developed the Fish Forever Program, which is being used throughout the Philippines and Indonesia. Fish Forever is under the umbrella of coastal fisheries reform using fully protected areas to protect essential fish habitat and to both replenish and sustain fish production. OurFish is an application applied to the program and a signature program of Rare, which is also applied to the Fish Forever Program, as is the use of Pride Campaigns to shift key behaviors. Blue Ventures, in collaboration with local communities, has helped develop the concept or approach known as locally managed marine areas (LMMAs). Blue Ventures’ LMMAs program focuses on three zones along Madagascar’s west coast, which together include over 75 communities, a combined coastal population of more than 40,000 people, and a total marine area of almost 6000 square kilometres.","McFarland, Brian Joseph",Conservation of Tropical Coral Reefs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972067/,772
47555,Exploring the Potential of Pondok Institutions as an Islamic Spiritual Tourism Product- The Case of Malaysia,2021-02-01,"Respiratory infections are an important and frequent cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Sex and gender-based differences in lung infection are recognized and gradually gaining importance due to the potential for gender-tailored therapeutics. While sex and gender differences are widely acknowledged in the evaluation of chronic respiratory disease states such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF), acute and chronic respiratory infection complicate all of these and, in themselves, depending on age and organism, demonstrate sex differences. Males are disadvantaged in the occurrence and severity of lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia, while females suffer more commonly with upper respiratory tract ailments including tonsillitis and sinusitis. Differences in genetics and immunity have been forwarded as explanations for such differences; however, it is likely that a complex interplay of sex steroid hormones, host immunity, genetics, anatomical variation, and lung physiology, in addition to sociocultural and behavioral factors, influences the observed sex differences in respiratory infection. This chapter aims to assess the current state of the literature in this field and expound the range of its contributory factors.","Yong, Valerie F. L.; Jaggi, Tavleen K.; Chan, Louisa L.

We consider the phenomena of “digital twins” vs “digital trace”. The first one is a model, possessing the main features of a real scientific facility, while “digital trace” deals with a lake of raw data and scientific outcomes are produced by multiple data processing with various methods. Both approaches lead to dynamic digital infrastructure development; it becomes a prerequisite for the functioning of any megascience facility. We argue this to be the next stage in the scientific facilities development: in nearest future digital twins and digital trace together would eliminate the uniqueness of the megascience, and would lead to the formation of a new supra-infrastructure. This object should be evidently based on taking into account the interaction of man, society, science and technology.","Balyakin, Artem A.; Nurakhov, N. N.; Nurbina, M.

Significant urbanisation is underway in Southeast Asia. By 2030, an additional 90 million people are forecast to move to ASEAN cities. These urban populations are expected to triple by 2050. Issues like poverty, inequality, unsustainable energy consumption and declining infrastructure will shape government and business decisions for years to come. While our tropical environment is urbanising faster and faster, we are often unable to cope with—and adapt to—the challenges brought by these changes. What processes can be used to reduce inequities and injustices in the tropical built environment? This book has clustered the various topics under several tropes addressing resources, local frameworks and urban design and planning.

Media has a role in all phases of disaster management, from preparedness to during disaster, response and recovery. Different media have different target groups. Traditional media covers all age groups, while new media (like social media) is more popular among the younger generation. Role of media has been observed very strongly in addressing the global pandemic COVID-19. Citizen reporters are becoming popular to inform the ground realities during a disaster situation.

47575,Principles of Business Activity in the Context of Sustainable Development,2021-02-01,"BOSAI is a Japanese word to express various efforts to mitigate disaster risk. This chapter documents how NHK broadcasters have developed programs and other contents in order to spread BOSAI know-how from the program producers’ point of view. NHK WORLD-JAPAN is an international segment of NHK, the Japan Broadcasting Corporation. Its service primarily targets overseas audiences and its content is multilingual. In 2017, NHK started a radio program series of BOSAI, or disaster preparedness. The production team has since sought effective approaches to encourage people to take real action to reduce disaster risk, by expanding its services from broadcasting to online contents, SNS, events, etc. In this chapter, based on the experience of NHK WORLD-JAPAN, the authors focus on the concept of “participatory coverage,” inspired by “action research” in the academic world. “Participatory coverage” means that the media and citizens work together to improve society through the process of content production and by utilizing the content. This is especially important in the field of disaster preparedness, where taking action is indispensable to protect lives. The chapter also recognizes a TV program as an example of “participatory coverage,” because the collaborators continue learning BOSAI on their own even after the program was over.","Kusagaya, Midori; Khin, Aye Nge",Media and Disaster Risk Reduction,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972099/,772

While the society of Western Europe starts all the transformations from the personality change, waiting for changes from outside is a characteristic feature for our sociocultural, the post-Soviet area. The existing crisis of social transformations gives an essential stimulus to active formation of a new paradigm of social relations. Both for developed countries, which believed that the onset of a crisis was a problem for the future, so for Ukraine and Kazakhstan, which already live in conditions of combined social systems, the pandemic came as a surprise. Thus, the education must response quickly to such changes, forming new approaches, forms and methods of knowledge of social discourse. The aim of the article is to study new models of educational practices (in particular digitalization) that became the most common in society during the period of crisis associated with quarantine conditions, accompanied by forced self-isolation of citizens and determining roles in online learning, allowing to formulate new strategies for adapting to the conditions of limiting social activity. The authors disclosed its main components, identified key aspects of Internet prospects of studying. Two relatively separate directions of this phenomenon analysis have been analyzed.

At all educational levels, on-site lecturing had to switch instantaneously to an online mode of instruction. This transition was so straightforward, that the argument could be made for online education to become a permanent fixture, particularly if it is more efficient, cheaper, and more effective than traditional education. Extensive meta-analyses, however, show that most online teaching practices do not lead to better educational outcomes than the on-site alternatives. Worse yet, the traditional face-to-face mode of lecturing is ineffective in the absence of personalized interactions. The proposed solutions are offered by artificial intelligence research, including virtual reality, intelligent tutoring systems, and serious games—solutions that have so far not been extensively implemented in practice. The current health crisis provides our educational professionals with an opportunity to rethink their teaching practices and focus on applying these promising new alternatives.","Louwerse, Max; Postma, Marie; Horden, Maarten; Sluijtman, Anton",The New Common,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978793/,772

Key features of InTempo, such as, the integration of temporal requirements into graph queries, the in-memory storage of the model, and a systematic method to contain the model’s memory consumption, intend to address issues which seemingly place limitations on the available tool support.

Some people will look for scapegoats to put the blame on, while others will search for ways by which the crisis can also be perceived as something beneficial. As far as the COVID-19 pandemic goes, earlier this year, media and politicians pointed towards China, where the pandemic started, or to Italy, from where the virus spread over the European continent. Since the beginning of the crisis, we have also been flooded with gurus, motivational speakers, and mindfulness coaches who stimulate us to view the new common as an unexpected but much needed “reboot” of our day-to-day life. Intriguingly enough, these two individual and collective coping strategies are very familiar to those who are acquainted with the Christian philosophical and theological traditions. When confronted with the apparent paradox between the idea of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent deity on the one hand and the experience of everyday pain and suffering on the other hand, Christians have sought for ways to find a satisfactory solution.

49437,Factors Driving the Adoption of Mobile Banking App: An Empirical Assessment in the Less Digitalized Economy,2020-11-10,"Acute liver failure (ALF) is characterized by the onset of coagulopathy and encephalopathy caused by hepatocyte injury that evolve over days or weeks. The absence of existing liver disease distinguishes ALF from acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). Acetaminophen toxicity, viral, autoimmune and ischemic hepatitis are some of the common causes of ALF. Clinical features include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and depressed mental status. However, these nonspecific symptoms can rapidly be followed by multiple organ failure and death. Deterioration often occurs despite supportive and therapeutic measures. Liver transplantation is the only definitive treatment in patients who do not recover their liver function. ACLF on the other hand involves acute deterioration in liver function in a patient with pre-existing chronic liver disease leading to different organ failures. There are different definitions, classifications, and prognostic assessments of patients with ACLF. Infections (bacterial or viral) and inflammation (acute alcoholic hepatitis) are common precipitating events, although, some patients develop ACLF without a clear trigger. Similar to ALF, clinical features include jaundice, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and depressed mental status which may quickly deteriorate to multiple organ failure and death. Clinical management focuses on supportive care and management of specific precipitating factors. Liver transplantation remains a definitive treatment in patients who do not improve despite medical support.","Glass, Daniel M.; Al-Khafaji, Ali",Liver Failure,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980014/,772
49438,There Is Nothing Real! A Study of Nonuse of TikTok in India,2020-11-10,"The tourism sector has numerous intertwined subsectors, with the performance of each critical to the performance of the other. The car rental is critical to the success of the tourism industry, yet it remains under, and thus there is limited knowledge on how the previous pandemic impacted the car rentals industry. This study examines the impact of COVID-19 on the car rental as well as ride and share transport niches of the tourism industry. Making use of secondary and archival data, the study found that the two subsectors lost revenue amounting to billions of dollars in potential revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic resulted in company rating downgrades, market volatility and loss of share value for leading entities such as Hertz, Avis, Europcar, Uber and Lyft. However, the impact of the pandemic on ride and share transport was moderate compared to car rentals. The pandemic led to Hertz filing for bankruptcy, albeit after paying US$16 million in retention bonuses on the eve of bankruptcy to its executives. Losses led to various cost-containment measures, which saw a record number of employees being laid off and disposal of non-core assets. The chapter recommends a robust, coordinated health and safety certification and protocol for the industry to ensure the safety of passengers and employees to boost confidence in the sector as it emerges from the pandemic. Furthermore, a call is made to revisit employment conditions in this sector with the view to provide better protection of employees from the COVID-19 and other disaster-related market shocks. A revision of the current business model is imperative, given the vulnerability of the sector to shock to ensure disaster resilience. Impact assessment post the pandemic will be critical to get a full picture of the impact, particularly on small businesses that were not covered in this study.","Nhamo, Godwell; Dube, Kaitano; Chikodzi, David",Counting the Cost of COVID-19 on the Global Tourism Industry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980015/,772

Visible and loud are the negative impacts of the pandemic globally, threatening the attainment of both the health and other sustainable development goals (SDGs). Hence, the call of many governments to have all the stakeholders on board did not fall on deaf ears. Drawing from the events study and public announcements methodology, this chapter mainly documents the contributions from corporates, philanthropists, civil society organisations and members of the public towards COVID-19 initiatives. The findings are that the world over, many stakeholders raised their hands to help in mighty ways, particularly after the World Health Organisation’s declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic and escalating lockdowns. This was also the case in South Africa, a country documented as a case study, where the Solidarity Fund was established with billions of rands donated. For South Africa, it was a true embracing of the ubuntu (I am because you are) concept post the apartheid era. It is recommended that the model followed by corporate South Africa be kept alive to enable the nation to bounce back quicker and build resilience against similar future disasters. Pandemics, epidemics and other natural disasters remain the new global and national norm. As such, working together, stakeholders can do more with less.

Here we report the identification of neutralizing single domain VNAR antibodies selected against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike protein derived from the Wuhan variant using phage display. We identified 56 unique binding clones that exhibited high affinity and specificity to the spike protein. Of those, 10 showed an ability to block both the spike protein receptor binding domain from the Wuhan variant and the N501Y mutant from interacting with recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in vitro. In addition, three antibody clones retained in vitro blocking activity when the E484K spike protein mutant was used. The inhibitory property of the VNAR antibodies was further confirmed for all 10 antibody clones using ACE2 expressing cells with spike protein from the Wuhan variant. The viral neutralizing potential of the VNAR clones was also confirmed for the 10 antibodies tested using live Wuhan variant virus in in vitro cell infectivity assays. Single domain VNAR antibodies, due to their low complexity, small size, unique epitope recognition, and formatting flexibility, should be a useful adjunct to existing antibody approaches to treat COVID-19.","Gauhar, Aziz; Privezentzev, Cyril V; Demydchuk, Mykhaylo; Gerlza, Tanja; Rieger, Julia; Kungl, Andreas J; Walsh, Frank S; Rutkowski, J Lynn; Stocki, Pawel",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202100986rr; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34637549/,772

Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has now been accepted as a less invasive alternative to conventional laparoscopic surgery. However, commercially available access devices for SILS had disadvantages such as rigidness and crowding. This series aimed to analyze the feasibility and safety of single-incision laparoscopic trans-abdominal pre-peritoneal hernioplasty (SILS-TAPP) by applying our self-made device for managing inguinal hernia.We collected and reviewed the medical records of patients who received SILS-TAPP using a self-made glove-port device between January 2014 and January 2016. All operations were performed by the same surgical team. The demographics and intra- and perioperative outcomes were evaluated.SILS-TAPP was successfully performed in 105 patients (131 inguinal hernia repairs). No major intra- and postoperative morbidities were encountered, and no conversion to a conventional 3-port approach or open surgery was required. The mean operative time was 73.5 min and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 2.1 days. Three minor short-term complications were noted, which were resolved without surgical intervention. One recurrence was diagnosed during follow-up and treated using a second TAPP procedure.SILS-TAPP was shown to be a feasible, safe procedure in patients with an inguinal hernia.

170991,Viral spillover risk in High Arctic increases with melting glaciers,2021-08-23,"Background: Researchers have increasingly recognized the adverse effects of smoking on tuberculosis (TB) outcomes. Smoking may be a maladaptive coping mechanism for depression and anxiety among TB patients; however, this association has not yet been investigated. Design/Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among newly diagnosed TB patients between January and December 2019 in Gaborone, Botswana, and evaluated factors associated with cigarette smoking. Using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety scale, we collected depression and anxiety scores, respectively; scores of [≥]10 indicate depression and scores of [≥]36 indicate anxiety. We performed Poisson regression analyses with robust variance to examine whether depression and anxiety were associated with smoking. Results: One hundred and eighty participants with TB were enrolled from primary health clinics. Among all enrollees, depression was reported in 46 (27.1%) participants, while anxiety was reported in 60 (44.4%) participants. Overall, 45 (25.0%) participants reported current smoking, and the median number of cigarettes per day was 10. Depressive symptoms were associated with a higher prevalence of smoking (aPR: 1.82; 95% CI = 1.11, 3.01) after adjusting for sex, HIV status, food insecurity, anxiety, and income. The association between anxiety symptoms and cigarette smoking did not reach statistical significance (aPR 1.26; 95% CI: 0.78-2.05). Conclusions: We found the association between depressive symptoms and smoking among TB patients in Botswana to be significant and the association between anxiety symptoms and cigarette smoking insignificant. Future studies should further investigate these associations when addressing TB care.","Shin, S.; Jones-Patten, A.

175931,The development of motion comic storyboard based on digital literacy and elementary school mathematics ability in the new normal era during covid-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: CD20 depletion is a highly-effective treatment for relapsing multiple sclerosis that maintains B cells at low levels through six monthly dosing of 600mg ocrelizumab. This dosing schedule is associated with inhibition of seroconversion following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, in contrast to the high levels of seroconversion following treatment with alemtuzumab and cladribine tablets. A number of emerging reports suggest that repopulation of 1-3% B cells facilitates seroconversion after CD20-depletion. The frequency of this occurring following repeated ocrelizumab treatment, after other DMT, and after treatment cessation is largely unknown. METHODS: Relapse data, lymphocyte and CD19 B cell numbers were extracted from phase II ocrelizumab extension study (NCT00676715) data supplied by the manufacturer via the Vivli Inc, trial data-request portal. Repopulation data of oral cladribine from the phase III CLARITY study (NCT00213135) was supplied by the European Medicines Agency; and the alemtuzumab phase III CARE-MS I (NCT00530348) and CARE-MS II (NCT00548405) trial data were supplied by the manufacturer via the clinicalstudydatarequest.com portal. RESULTS: Only 3-5% of people with MS exhibit 1% B cells at 6 months after the last infusion following 3-4 cycles of ocrelizumab, compared to 50-55% at 9 months, and 85-90% at 12 months. During this time relapses occurred at consistent disease breakthrough rates compared to people during standard therapy. In contrast most people (90-100%) exhibited more than 1% B cells during treatment with either cladribine or alemtuzumab. CONCLUSIONS. Few people repopulate peripheral B cells with standard ocrelizumab dosing, however an extending the dosing interval by 3-6 months may allow many more people to potentially seroconvert in the relative absence of excess relapse-activity. Most people demonstrate B cell repletion within 3 months of the last treatment of alemtuzumab and cladribine. This may help protect against severe COVID-19.","Baker, D.; MacDougall, A.; Kang, A.

178653,Students’ higher-order thinking skills in discrete mathematics during covid-19 pandemic,2021,"High-throughput single-cell sequencing (scSeq) technologies are revolutionizing the ability to molecularly profile B and T lymphocytes by offering the opportunity to simultaneously obtain information on adaptive immune receptor repertoires (VDJ repertoires) and transcriptomes. An integrated quantification of immune repertoire parameters such as germline gene usage, clonal expansion, somatic hypermutation and transcriptional states opens up new possibilities for the high-resolution analysis of lymphocytes and the inference of antigen-specificity. While multiple tools now exist to investigate gene expression profiles from scSeq of transcriptomes, there is a lack of software dedicated to single-cell immune repertoires. Here, we present Platypus, an open-source software platform providing a user-friendly interface to investigate B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires from single-cell sequencing experiments. Platypus provides a framework to automate and ease the analysis of single-cell immune repertoires while also incorporating transcriptional information involving unsupervised clustering, gene expression, and gene ontology. To showcase the capabilities of Platypus, we use it to analyze and visualize single-cell immune repertoires and transcriptomes from B and T cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients, revealing unique insight into the repertoire features and transcriptional profiles of clonally expanded lymphocytes. Platypus will expedite progress by increasing accessibility to the broader immunology community by facilitating the analysis of single-cell immune repertoire and transcriptome sequencing.","Yermanos, Alexander; Agrafiotis, Andreas; Yates, Josephine; Papadopoulou, Chrysa; Robbiani, Damiano; Bieberich, Florian; Vazquez-Lombardi, Rodrigo; Neumeuer, Daniel; Oxenius, Annette; Reddy, Sai T.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.09.374280,772

The present article explores electronic service learning, which focuses on service-learning opportunities that do not require face-to-face interaction with community partners, and provides two examples of alternative service-learning assignments used in a developmental psychology course. Eighteen students enrolled in an upper-level course on child development engaged with course material and empirical articles to understand the content of various children's books or to create educational videos for children. A library of storybook recordings and electronic videos produced by the students was then shared with a local nonprofit organization's preschool teachers to use in their classrooms. Students reported very positive experiences with these assignments and highlighted the benefits of electronic service learning, in particular. This assignment could easily be adapted to other courses within psychology and some examples are described.

194992,A SARS commentary.,2003,"Vaccination is the primary measure for preventing morbidity and mortality from influenza. During the influenza season, family physicians must distinguish influenza from the common cold and other flu-like illnesses. Signs and symptoms of influenza include abrupt onset of fever, severe myalgias, anorexia, sore throat, headache, cough, and malaise. Clinical diagnosis can be difficult or nonspecific when patients have other symptoms (e.g., stuffy nose, sneezing, cough, sore throat) that can be caused by various respiratory viruses or bacterial pathogens. Family physicians can improve diagnostic accuracy by being aware of the epidemiology of influenza. During outbreaks of influenza, commercially available rapid assays can be used to identify type A and B viruses. On average, rapid in-office tests are more than 70 percent sensitive and 90 percent specific for viral antigens. The assays vary in complexity, specificity, sensitivity, time to obtain results, specimen analyzed, and cost.

The national call for transforming primary care requires innovation in the education of prelicensure nursing students. PROBLEM: To ensure future RNs can function in the primary care setting and assume enhanced roles within the interprofessional team, prelicensure nursing students need to be exposed to primary care. A key barrier to providing this essential education is the lack of partnerships with primary care facilities. APPROACH: The purpose of this project was to collaborate with rural practice partners to provide a primary care clinical experience for prelicensure nursing students. OUTCOMES: Collaboration between academic-practice partners to develop a clinical experience for prelicensure nursing students allowed exposure to the role of RNs in rural primary care.

209496,Does flipped learning method via MOODLE can improve outcomes and motivation of discrete mathematics learning during COVID-19 pandemic?,2021,"RATIONALE: About 50% of hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) developed myocardial damage. The mechanisms of direct SARS-CoV-2 cardiomyocyte infection include viral invasion via ACE2-Spike glycoprotein-binding. In DM patients, the impact of glycation of ACE2 on cardiomyocyte invasion by SARS-CoV-2 can be of high importance. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in cardiomyocytes from heart autopsy of DM cases compared to Non-DM; to investigate the role of DM in SARS-COV-2 entry in cardiomyocytes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated consecutive autopsy cases, deceased for COVID-19, from Italy between Apr 30, 2020 and Jan 18, 2021. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 in cardiomyocytes, expression of ACE2 (total and glycosylated form), and transmembrane protease serine protease-2 (TMPRSS2) protein. In order to study the role of diabetes on cardiomyocyte alterations, independently of COVID-19, we investigated ACE2, glycosylated ACE2, and TMPRSS2 proteins in cardiomyocytes from DM and Non-DM explanted-hearts. Finally, to investigate the effects of DM on ACE2 protein modification, an in vitro glycation study of recombinant human ACE2 (hACE2) was performed to evaluate the effects on binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The authors included cardiac tissue from 97 autopsies. DM was diagnosed in 37 patients (38%). Fourth-seven out of 97 autopsies (48%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cardiomyocytes. Thirty out of 37 DM autopsy cases (81%) and 17 out of 60 Non-DM autopsy cases (28%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cardiomyocytes. Total ACE2, glycosylated ACE2, and TMPRSS2 protein expressions were higher in cardiomyocytes from autopsied and explanted hearts of DM than Non-DM. In vitro exposure of monomeric hACE2 to 120 mM glucose for 12 days led to non-enzymatic glycation of four lysine residues in the neck domain affecting the protein oligomerization. CONCLUSIONS: The upregulation of ACE2 expression (total and glycosylated forms) in DM cardiomyocytes, along with non-enzymatic glycation, could increase the susceptibility to COVID-19 infection in DM patients by favouring the cellular entry of SARS-CoV2.","D039,; Onofrio, Nunzia; Scisciola, Lucia; Sardu, Celestino; Trotta, Maria Consiglia; De Feo, Marisa; Maiello, Ciro; Mascolo, Pasquale; De Micco, Francesco; Turriziani, Fabrizio; Municinò, Emilia; Monetti, Pasquale; Lombardi, Antonio; Napolitano, Maria Gaetana; Marino, Federica Zito; Ronchi, Andrea; Grimaldi, Vincenzo; Hermenean, Anca; Rizzo, Maria Rosaria; Barbieri, Michelangela; Franco, Renato; Campobasso, Carlo Pietro; Napoli, Claudio; Municinò, Maurizio; Paolisso, Giuseppe; Balestrieri, Maria Luisa; Marfella, Raffaele",Cardiovasc Diabetol,,772

In this context, COVID-19 may trigger a certain time-delay in new installed PV projects, thereby bringing an uncertain influence on the whole PV industry. To forecast the influence degree and influence cycle of COVID-19 on PV industry, this paper firstly clarifies the key features of epidemic situation as well as the basic rule of such pandemics' transmission along industry-chain. Then this paper constructs a system dynamics model targeting at cost accounting of PV power generation under the influence of COVID-19 and thus forecasts the variation rules, superposition effects and influence cycle of levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of PV power generation and the operations cost of each sub-system. Empirical results show that PV industry has a lag response to the COVID-19 for 1 quarter and periodic response for 4 quarters, which is mainly embodied in the rise of short-term production cost. At the same time, the influence of COVID-19 on the upstream firms of PV industry is stronger than that on downstream firms. With the gradual recovery of whole industry-chain, LCOE of PV power generation will rapidly return to the previous expected level of grid parity by the end of 2020.","Song, Yazhi; Liu, Tiansen; Li, Yin; Ye, Bin",,,772

218417,Effect of macroeconomic variables on Jakarta composite index before and the time of COVID19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Australia implemented a travel ban on China on 1 February 2020, while COVID-19 was largely localized to China. We modelled three scenarios to test the impact of travel bans on epidemic control. Scenario one was no ban; scenario two and three were the current ban followed by a full or partial lifting (allow over 100 000 university students to enter Australia, but not tourists) from the 8th of March 2020. METHODS: We used disease incidence data from China and air travel passenger movements between China and Australia during and after the epidemic peak in China, derived from incoming passenger arrival cards. We used the estimated incidence of disease in China, using data on expected proportion of under-ascertainment of cases and an age-specific deterministic model to model the epidemic in each scenario. RESULTS: The modelled epidemic with the full ban fitted the observed incidence of cases well, predicting 57 cases on March 6th in Australia, compared to 66 observed on this date; however, we did not account for imported cases from other countries. The modelled impact without a travel ban results in more than 2000 cases and about 400 deaths, if the epidemic remained localized to China and no importations from other countries occurred. The full travel ban reduced cases by about 86%, while the impact of a partial lifting of the ban is minimal and may be a policy option. CONCLUSIONS: Travel restrictions were highly effective for containing the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia during the epidemic peak in China and averted a much larger epidemic at a time when COVID-19 was largely localized to China. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of travel bans applied to countries with high disease incidence. This research can inform decisions on placing or lifting travel bans as a control measure for the COVID-19 epidemic.","Costantino, Valentina; Heslop, David J; MacIntyre, C Raina",J. travel med,,772

There are no commercial drugs targeting coronaviruses (CoVs), and few studies on anti-PEDV inhibitors. The coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CLpro) has a conserved structure and catalytic mechanism and plays a key role during viral polyprotein processing, thus serving as an appealing antiviral drug target. Here, we report the anti-PEDV effect of the broad-spectrum inhibitor GC376 (targeting 3Cpro or 3CLpro of viruses in the picornavirus-like supercluster). GC376 was highly effective against the PEDV 3CLpro and exerted similar inhibitory effects on two PEDV strains. Furthermore, the structure of the PEDV 3CLpro in complex with GC376 was determined at 1.65 Å. We elucidated structural details and analyzed the differences between GC376 binding with the PEDV 3CLpro and GC376 binding with the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) 3CLpro. Finally, we explored the substrate specificity of PEDV 3CLpro at the P2 site and analyzed the effects of Leu group modification in GC376 on inhibiting PEDV infection. This study helps us to understand better the PEDV 3CLpro substrate specificity, providing information on the optimization of GC376 for development as an antiviral therapeutic against coronaviruses.","Ye, Gang; Wang, Xiaowei; Tong, Xiaohan; Shi, Yuejun; Fu, Zhen F; Peng, Guiqing",Viruses,,772
219265,"A Systematic Review on AI-based Proctoring Systems: Past, Present and Future",2021,"CONTEXT: Advance care planning (ACP) conversations represent an important physician skill, a need further highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most resident ACP training occurs in inpatient, settings, often featuring goals of care (GOC) conversations during a crisis. Outpatient clinics are valuable but underutilized settings to provide skills training for residents, yet little research has been done in these spaces. OBJECTIVE: We sought to 1) create an ACP curriculum harnessing the principles of a community of practice in a virtual format, and 2) obtain residents' perspectives regarding their skills and confidence in having early GOC conversations in the outpatient setting. METHODS: We interviewed 48 internal medicine residents using questionnaires, reflective narratives, and transcripts of debriefing conversations. We created a virtual curriculum during the ambulatory week which included didactics, virtual role plays, ACP phone conversations with five patients, and group debriefings. Quantitative data were analyzed for changes in resident confidence. Qualitative data were coded using thematic analysis, guided by instructor field notes. RESULTS: Residents reported decreased confidence in navigating advance directive conversations following training [Z=2.24, P=0.03, râ¯=â¯0.33]. Resident reflections indicated that they felt more practiced at inpatient late GOC conversation skills, and that these skills were not fully transferable to the outpatient early GOC setting. Residents also endorsed the ambulatory environment as the best space for ACP conversations. CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the feasibility of a virtual format for ACP curriculum. The virtual community of practice created space for a metacognitive unmasking of prior resident unconscious incompetence. Also, inpatient, crisis-oriented late GOC conversation skills may translate poorly to the outpatient setting requiring early and ongoing GOC skills. Residents need more training to navigate ACP conversations in ambulatory environments.","Mills, Sarah; Cioletti, Anne; Gingell, Gareth; Ramani, Subha",J. pain symptom manage,,772

Due to the unknown nature of the disease and the lack of specific drugs, several potential treatments were used for patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis will evaluate studies of the effects of favipiravir in COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search electronic databases including LitCovid hub, PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Sciences, Cochrane and Embase using keywords related to COVID-19 and favipiravir. We will search the reference lists of all included studies and reviews. We will also search for clinical trial registries, such as ClinicalTrials.gov, for the ongoing clinical trials. All randomised clinical trials investigating the safety and efficacy of favipiravir compared with other control groups for the treatment of patients with confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 will be included. Patients' survival at the end of the treatment as well as the follow-up will be the primary outcome of the treatment, followed by the time and rate of the patient with a negative COVID-19 test. The desired secondary outcome will consist of a decreased rate of symptoms, proportion of intensive care unit (ICU) transfers, length of the hospital stay, ICU treatments, the quality of life and additional adverse events. Data synthesis will be conducted using CMA V.2. Two independent investigators will be screening titles, abstracts and full texts of included studies, based on eligibility criteria. These investigators will then independently extract the data and appraise the quality of said studies. All potential discrepancies will be resolved through consultation with the third reviewer. Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using a standard I2 test. A funnel plot, Egger's test and Begg's test will be used for detecting asymmetry to explore possible publication bias. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis will help identify the safety and efficacy of favipiravir for patients with COVID-19. Given that the design of the study is a systematic review, there is no need to follow the code of ethics protocol. The results of this study will be published in a reputable journal.

All studies reported PCR-based testing and 12 also included viral culture data. Among 28 studies, the overall pooled median duration of RNA shedding from respiratory sources was 18.4 days (95% CI, 15.5-21.3; I2 = 98.87%; P < .01). When stratified by disease severity, the pooled median duration of viral RNA shedding from respiratory sources was 19.8 days (95% CI, 16.2-23.5; I2 = 96.42%; P < .01) among severely ill patients and 17.2 days (95% CI, 14.0-20.5; I2 = 95.64%; P < .01) in mild-to-moderate illness. Viral RNA was detected up to 92 days after symptom onset. Viable virus was isolated by culture from -6 to 20 days relative to symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-COV-2 RNA shedding can be prolonged, yet high heterogeneity exists. Detection of viral RNA may not correlate with infectivity since available viral culture data suggests shorter durations of shedding of viable virus. Additional data are needed to determine the duration of shedding of viable virus and the implications for risk of transmission.","Fontana, Lauren M; Villamagna, Angela Holly; Sikka, Monica K; McGregor, Jessina C",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,772
224213,Multi arm bandit optimization to mitigate covid19 risk,2021,"In Chile, vaccines were produced from the late 19th century to the early 21st century without interruption. The production was carried out in State institutes, from where the health service was supplied for the vaccination programs. In addition to manufacturing, packaging and distributing vaccines, the State institutes, in particular the Instituto Bacteriológico (IB), exported vaccines to Latin America and carried out research and development, standing out in this area with the Fuenzalida-Palacios vaccine for the control of human and canine rabies. The present study provides a list of vaccines produced in Chile at State institutes between the end of the 19th century and 2005, and a discussion on the visions of the State role that justified the actions regarding the production of vaccines in Chile. The developmental State of the mid-twentieth century gave way to the neoliberal State that was institutionalized with the 1980 constitution, which defines the subsidiary role of the State that has guided the discussion on local vaccine production in the last decades.","Ibarra M, Cecilia; Parada V, Mirtha",Rev Chilena Infectol,,772

There is an urgent need for a vaccine to help control contagion, reduce mortality and alleviate social costs. In this study, we propose a rational multi-epitope candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Using bioinformatics, we constructed a library of potential vaccine peptides, based on the affinity of the most common major human histocompatibility complex (HLA) I and II molecules in the LATAM population to predict immunological complexes among antigenic, non-toxic and non-allergenic peptides extracted from the conserved regions of 92 proteomes. Although HLA-C, had the greatest antigenic peptide capacity from SARS-CoV-2, HLA-B and HLA-A, could be more relevant based on COVID-19 risk of infection in LATAM countries. We also used three-dimensional structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins to identify potential regions for antibody production. The best HLA-I and II predictions (with increased coverage in common alleles and regions evoking B lymphocyte responses) were grouped into an optimized final multi-epitope construct containing the adjuvants Beta defensin-3, TpD, and PADRE, which are recognized for invoking a safe and specific immune response. Finally, we used Molecular Dynamics to identify the multi-epitope construct which may be a stable target for TLR-4/MD-2. This would prove to be safe and provide the physicochemical requirements for conducting experimental tests around the world.","Cuspoca, Andrés Felipe Díaz Laura Lorena Acosta Alvaro Fernando Peñaloza Marcela Katherine Méndez Yardany Rafael Clavijo Diana Carolina Yosa Reyes Juvenal",Vaccines,,772

This study investigated whether patients hospitalized with COVID-19 differed in BMI at older versus younger ages and whether trends were independent of diabetes and hypertension. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 at Northwestern Memorial Hospital from March 19, 2020, until April 4, 2020, was performed. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 above and below the age of 50 were compared as well as those hospitalized without COVID-19. RESULTS: Patients younger than 50 years of age hospitalized with COVID-19 without diabetes or hypertension had mean BMI greater than those older than 50 years of age, with BMI 43.1 (95% CI: 34.5-51.7) versus 30.1 (95% CI: 27.7-32.5) (P = 0.02). Furthermore, BMI appeared to inversely correlate with increasing age among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We did not detect the same difference or trend for patients hospitalized without COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Younger patients (age < 50 years) with COVID-19 had higher mean BMI than older patients with COVID-19, with and without diabetes and hypertension. This trend did not exist in patients without COVID-19 hospitalized during the same time period.","Bhasin, Ajay; Nam, Hannah; Yeh, Chen; Lee, Jungwha; Liebovitz, David; Achenbach, Chad",Obesity (Silver Spring),,772

236151,"Evolution of mobility sector during and beyond Covid-19: viewpoint of industries, consultancies and public transport companies",2020,"BACKGROUND: Population mobility is closely associated with COVID-19 transmission, and it could be used as a proximal indicator to predict future outbreaks, which could inform proactive nonpharmaceutical interventions for disease control. South Carolina is one of the US states that reopened early, following which it experienced a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to examine the spatial-temporal relationship between population mobility and COVID-19 outbreaks and use population mobility data to predict daily new cases at both the state and county level in South Carolina. METHODS: This longitudinal study used disease surveillance data and Twitter-based population mobility data from March 6 to November 11, 2020, in South Carolina and its five counties with the largest number of cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases. Population mobility was assessed based on the number of Twitter users with a travel distance greater than 0.5 miles. A Poisson count time series model was employed for COVID-19 forecasting. RESULTS: Population mobility was positively associated with state-level daily COVID-19 incidence as well as incidence in the top five counties (ie, Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, and Richland). At the state level, the final model with a time window within the last 7 days had the smallest prediction error, and the prediction accuracy was as high as 98.7%, 90.9%, and 81.6% for the next 3, 7, and 14 days, respectively. Among Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, and Richland counties, the best predictive models were established based on their observations in the last 9, 14, 28, 20, and 9 days, respectively. The 14-day prediction accuracy ranged from 60.3%-74.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Using Twitter-based population mobility data could provide acceptable predictions of COVID-19 daily new cases at both the state and county level in South Carolina. Population mobility measured via social media data could inform proactive measures and resource relocations to curb disease outbreaks and their negative influences.","Zeng, Chengbo; Zhang, Jiajia; Li, Zhenlong; Sun, Xiaowen; Olatosi, Bankole; Weissman, Sharon; Li, Xiaoming",J Med Internet Res,,772

249716,Teachers' difficulties in implementing distance learning during Covid-19 pandemic,2020,"The study presents a model of the clinical and psychological picture of our contemporaries' experience of tragic events related to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is shown that the deformation of everyday life under the influence of threatening circumstances sharpened the features of the clinical and psychological picture of everyday life of our contemporaries. As the most significant features, the authors note experiences of the type of traumatic stress (fear of losing a job, experience of limited movement, concern about the problems of the near and distant future, in connection with the transition to remote work, fear of the lack of clear prospects for the future), as well as experiences that create a risk of reducing social interest (a decrease in the level of direct interpersonal contacts, boredom due to a decrease in social and intellectual activity, feelings of helplessness and impotence, fear of loss of autonomy and independence). It is shown that the psychological characteristics of modern people, especially young people and adolescents (representatives of Y and Z generations), create obstacles to the application of the experience of coping with the difficulties of previous generations due to the widespread postmodern worldview with its characteristic features. The tendency of modern existential psychotherapy and positive psychology to accept suffering as an experience necessary for personal growth is shown. As a metaphor for the spiritual life of a contemporary and the inability to help people in need of help, the authors cite the images of the film ""Mirror for the Hero"" (1987) because of their special relevance in our time.

The comparative effectiveness and safety among PCC products are not fully understood. METHODS: Patients in an academic level one trauma center who received PCC3 or PCC4 for EWR were identified. Patient characteristics, PCC dose and time of dose, pre- and post-INR and time of measurement, fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K doses, and patient outcomes were collected. Patients whose pre-PCC International Normalized Ratio (INR) was > 6 h before PCC dose or the pre-post PCC INR was > 12 h were excluded. The primary outcome was achieving an INR &#8804; 1.5 post PCC. Secondary outcomes were the change in INR over time, post PCC INR, thromboembolic events (TE), and death during hospital stay. Logistic regression modelled the primary outcome with and without a propensity score adjustment accounting for age, sex, actual body weight, dose, initial INR value, and time between INR measurements. Data are reported as median (IQR) or n (%) with p < 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: Eighty patients were included (PCC3 = 57, PCC4 = 23). More PCC4 patients achieved goal INR (87.0% vs. 31.6%, odds ratio (OR) = 14.4, 95% CI: 3.80-54.93, p < 0.001). This result remained true after adjusting for possible confounders (AOR = 10.7, 95% CI: 2.17-51.24, p < 0.001). The post-PCC INR was lower in the PCC4 group (1.3 (1.3-1.5) vs. 1.7 (1.5-2.0)).

251856,"Distance learning and its effectiveness in improving literacy, education and skills development for remote population and for overcoming the challenges of COVID 19",2020,"RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Applying traditional industrial quality improvement (QI) methodologies to primary care is often inappropriate because primary care and its relationship to the healthcare macrosystem has many features of a complex adaptive system (CAS) that is particularly responsive to bottom-up rather than top-down management approaches. We report on a demonstration case study of improvements made in the Family Health Center (FHC) of the JPS Health Network in a refugee patient population that illustrate features of QI in a CAS framework as opposed to a traditional QI approach. METHODS: We report on changes in health system utilization by new refugee patients of the FHC from 2016 to 2017. We review the literature and summarize relevant theoretical understandings of quality management in complex adaptive systems as it applies to this case example. RESULTS: Applying CAS principles in the FHC, utilization of the Emergency Department and Urgent Care Center by newly arrived refugee patients before their first clinic visit was reduced by more than half (total visits decreased from 31%-14% of the refugee patients). Our review of the literature demonstrates that traditional algorithmic top-down QI processes are most often unsuccessful in improving even a few single-disease metrics, and increases clinician burnout and penalizes clinicians who care for vulnerable patients. Improvement in a CAS occurs when front-line clinicians identify care gaps and are given the flexibility to learn and self-organize to enable new care processes to emerge, which are created from bottom-up leadership that utilize existing interdependencies and interact with the top levels of the organization through intelligent top-down causation. We give examples of early adapters who are better applying the principles of CAS change to their QI efforts. CONCLUSIONS: Meaningful improvement in primary care is more likely achieved when the impetus to implement change shifts from top-down to bottom-up.","Young, Richard A; Nelson, Mark J; Castellon, Ricardo E; Martin, Carmel M",J Eval Clin Pract,,772

Young adults were previously found to have poorer functional capacity than healthy peers, but the question remains whether functional capacity degenerates further with age. Methods and Results A group of 30 patients with surgically closed VSDs (51±8 years) with 30 matched, healthy control participants (52±9 years) and a group of 30 patients with small unrepaired VSDs (55±12 years) and 30 matched control participants (55±10 years) underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing using an incremental workload protocol and noninvasive gas measurement. Peak oxygen uptake was lower in participants with closed VSDs than matched controls (24±7 versus 34±9 mL/min per kg, P<0.01) and with unrepaired VSDs than matched controls (26±5 versus 32±8 mL/min per kg, P<0.01). Patients demonstrated lower oxygen uptake from exercise levels at 20% of maximal workload compared with respective control groups (P<0.01). Peak ventilation was lower in patients with surgically closed VSDs than control participants (1.0±0.3 versus 1.4±0.4 L/min per kg, P<0.01) but similar in patients with unrepaired VSDs and control participants (P=0.14). Exercise capacity was 29% lower in older patients with surgically closed VSDs than healthy peers, whereas younger patients with surgically closed VSDs previously demonstrated 18% lower capacity compared with peers. Older patients with unrepaired VSDs reached 21% lower exercise capacity, whereas younger patients with unrepaired VSDs previously demonstrated 17% lower oxygen uptake than healthy peers. Conclusions Patients with VSDs demonstrate poorer exercise capacity than healthy peers. The difference between patients and control participants increased with advancing age-and increased most in patients with operated VSDs-compared with previous findings in younger patients. Results warrant continuous follow-up for these simple defects.","Maagaard, Marie; Eckerström, Filip; Boutrup, Nicolai; Hjortdal, Vibeke E",J Am Heart Assoc,,772
257596,Utilization of NON B3 Waste as Learning Media in Online Class during the Pandemic,2021,"The most effective way to control newly emerging infectious disease, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, is to strengthen preventative or therapeutic public health strategies before the infection spreads worldwide. However, global health systems remain at the early stages in anticipating effective therapeutics or vaccines to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While maintaining social distance is the most crucial metric to avoid spreading the virus, symptomatic therapy given to patients on the clinical manifestations helps save lives. The molecular properties of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been quickly elucidated, paving the way to therapeutics, vaccine development, and other medical interventions. Despite this progress, the detailed biomolecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains elusive. Given virus invasion of cells is a determining factor for virulence, understanding the viral entry process can be a mainstay in controlling newly emerged viruses. Since viral entry is mediated by selective cellular proteases or proteins associated with receptors, identification and functional analysis of these proteins could provide a way to disrupt virus propagation. This review comprehensively discusses cellular machinery necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding multifactorial traits of the virus entry will provide a substantial guide to facilitate antiviral drug development.","You, Jaehwan; Seok, Jong Hyeon; Joo, Myungsoo; Bae, Joon-Yong; Kim, Jin Il; Park, Man-Seong; Kim, Kisoon",,,772

283096,Impact of workplace spirituality on organizational commitment - A study in an emerging economy,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 epidemic is still spreading globally. Contact tracing is a vital strategy in epidemic emergency management; however, traditional contact tracing faces many limitations in practice. The application of digital technology provides an opportunity for local governments to trace the contacts of individuals with COVID-19 more comprehensively, efficiently, and precisely. OBJECTIVE: Our research aimed to provide new solutions to overcome the limitations of traditional contact tracing by introducing the organizational process, technical process, and main achievements of digital contact tracing in Hainan Province. METHODS: A graph database algorithm, which can efficiently process complex relational networks, was applied in Hainan Province; this algorithm relies on a governmental big data platform to analyze multisource COVID-19 epidemic data and build networks of relationships among high-risk infected individuals, the general population, vehicles, and public places to identify and trace contacts. We summarized the organizational and technical process of digital contact tracing in Hainan Province based on interviews and data analyses. RESULTS: An integrated emergency management command system and a multi-agency coordination mechanism were formed during the emergency management of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hainan Province. The collection, storage, analysis, and application of multisource epidemic data were realized based on the government's big data platform using a centralized model. The graph database algorithm is compatible with this platform and can analyze multisource and heterogeneous big data related to the epidemic. These practices were used to quickly and accurately identify and trace 10,871 contacts among hundreds of thousands of epidemic data records; 378 closest contacts and a number of public places with high risk of infection were identified. A confirmed patient was found after quarantine measures were implemented by all contacts. CONCLUSIONS: During the emergency management of the COVID-19 epidemic, Hainan Province used a graph database algorithm to trace contacts in a centralized model, which can identify infected individuals and high-risk public places more quickly and accurately. This practice can provide support to government agencies to implement precise, agile, and evidence-based emergency management measures and improve the responsiveness of the public health emergency response system. Strengthening data security, improving tracing accuracy, enabling intelligent data collection, and improving data-sharing mechanisms and technologies are directions for optimizing digital contact tracing.","Mao, Zijun; Yao, Hong; Zou, Qi; Zhang, Weiting; Dong, Ying",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,772

We compared specific Immunoglobulin responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) between two groups, intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU hospitalized patients over several weeks. Plasma specific IgG, IgM, and IgA levels were assessed using a commercial ELISA and compared to an in-house cell-based ELISA. Among the patients analyzed (mean (SD) of age, 64.4 (15.9) years, 19.2% female), 12 (46.2%) were hospitalized in ICU. IgG levels increased in non-ICU cases from the second to the eighth week after symptom onset. By contrast, IgG response was blunted in ICU patients over the same period. ICU patients with hematological malignancies had very weak or even undetectable IgG levels. While both groups had comparable levels of specific IgM antibodies, we found much lower levels of specific IgA in ICU versus non-ICU patients. In conclusion, COVID-19 ICU patients may be at risk of reinfection as their specific IgG response is declining in a matter of weeks.

290289,Whither plagiarism in distance learning academic assessment during COVID-19?,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that has given rise to the devastating global pandemic. In most cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in the development of viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, known as ""coronavirus disease 2019"" or COVID-19. Intriguingly, besides the respiratory tract, COVID-19 affects other organs and systems of the human body. COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease have a higher risk of death, and SARS-CoV-2 infection itself may cause myocardial inflammation and injury. One possible explanation of such phenomena is the fact that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor required for viral entry. ACE2 is expressed in the cells of many organs, including the heart. ACE2 functions as a carboxypeptidase that can cleave several endogenous substrates, including angiotensin II, thus regulating blood pressure and vascular tone. It remains largely unknown if the SARS-CoV-2 infection alters the enzymatic properties of ACE2, thereby contributing to cardiovascular complications in patients with COVID-19. Here, we demonstrate that ACE2 cleavage of des-Arg9-bradykinin substrate analog is markedly accelerated, while cleavage of angiotensin II analog is minimally affected by the binding of spike protein. These findings may have implications for a better understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Kiseleva, Anna A; Troisi, Elizabeth M; Hensley, Scott E; Kohli, Rahul M; Epstein, Jonathan A",,,772

296676,"Covid-19. Some moments of the 21st century, with a look at Milan",2020,"Active learning is a student-centered teaching technique that uses interactive, multimodal strategies to create a more engaging classroom setting compared to the traditional didactic lecture. Previous work by our research group showed that active learning in a first-year dental school physiology course improved student confidence with the material, unit exam performance, long-term retention of content, and perception of teaching effectiveness1. While there are many forms of active learning, this particular study utilized engaging lectures, in which students are given short periods of lecture, followed by ?breaks? that can consist of minute papers, problem sets, brainstorming sessions, or open discussion. As the COVID-19 pandemic forced faculty to suddenly shift to online teaching, there were concerns about how to actively engage students via distance learning. This was further complicated by an administrative decision at our School of Dentistry to present the course material in an asynchronous format using pre-recorded lectures. Since the original study completed in 2013, the Dental Physiology course has increased the amount of active learning components with 48% of the contact hours containing a high degree of active learning, 23% moderate amounts of active learning, and 29% traditional didactic lectures. It was desired to assess the effectiveness of active learning strategies in an online, asynchronous environment on student performance, attentiveness, and satisfaction levels. This study was determined to be exempt by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Louisville (#20.0655). Results indicated that pre-recorded sessions that incorporated active learning improved student performance compared to the pre-recorded traditional lectures. Similarly, active learning improved student perceptions of the course and teaching faculty. However, compared to earlier sections of the course that were presented face-to-face, the online, asynchronous format significantly lowered overall student performance and satisfaction. These results suggest that online physiology teaching, when presented in an asynchronous format, may pose significant challenges. While this study demonstrated the continued effectiveness of active learning strategies, further research is needed to optimize these methods and effectively engage students in online, asynchronous coursework. 1.

300766,Educational assistance bot,2021,"An interesting inference drawn by some Covid-19 epidemiological models is that there exists a proportion of the population who are not susceptible to infection -- even at the start of the current pandemic. This paper introduces a model of the immune response to a virus. This is based upon the same sort of mean-field dynamics as used in epidemiology. However, in place of the location, clinical status, and other attributes of people in an epidemiological model, we consider the state of a virus, B and T-lymphocytes, and the antibodies they generate. Our aim is to formalise some key hypotheses as to the mechanism of resistance. We present a series of simple simulations illustrating changes to the dynamics of the immune response under these hypotheses. These include attenuated viral cell entry, pre-existing cross-reactive humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity, and enhanced T-cell dependent immunity. Finally, we illustrate the potential application of this sort of model by illustrating variational inversion (using simulated data) of this model to illustrate its use in testing hypotheses. In principle, this furnishes a fast and efficient immunological assay--based on sequential serology--that provides a (i) quantitative measure of latent immunological responses and (ii) a Bayes optimal classification of the different kinds of immunological response (c.f., glucose tolerance tests used to test for insulin resistance). This may be especially useful in assessing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Parr, Thomas; Bhat, Anjali; Zeidman, Peter; Goel, Aimee; Billig, Alexander J.; Moran, Rosalyn; Friston, Karl J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08411v1.pdf,772

The calcium-dependent protease, calpain, participates in the development of neurodegeneration following concussion, but there is no information regarding the relative contribution of calpain-1 and calpain-2, the major calpain isoforms in the brain. We used a mouse model of repeated concussions, which reproduces most of the behavioral and neuropathological features of the human condition, to address this issue. Deletion of calpain-2 or treatment with a selective calpain-2 inhibitor for 2 weeks prevented most of these neuropathological features. Changes in TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) subcellular localization similar to those found in human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia were also prevented by deletion of calpain-2 or treatment with calpain-2 inhibitor. Our results indicate that a selective calpain-2 inhibitor represents a therapeutic approach for concussion.","Wang, Yubin; Liu, Yan; Nham, Amy; Sherbaf, Arash; Quach, Diana; Yahya, Emad; Ranburger, Davis; Bi, Xiaoning; Baudry, Michel",Sci.

There is concern a proportion of patients will progress to develop pulmonary fibrosis. We aimed to assess the temporal change in CXR infiltrates in a cohort of patients following hospitalisation for COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a single-centre prospective cohort study of patients admitted to University Hospital Southampton with confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection between 20th March and 3rd June 2020. Patients were approached for standard-of-care follow-up 12-weeks after hospitalisation. Inpatient and follow-up CXRs were scored by the assessing clinician for extent of pulmonary infiltrates; 0-4 per lung (Nil = 0, < 25% = 1, 25-50% = 2, 51-75% = 3, > 75% = 4). RESULTS: 101 patients with paired CXRs were included. Demographics: 53% male with a median (IQR) age 53.0 (45-63) years and length of stay 9 (5-17.5) days. The median CXR follow-up interval was 82 (77-86) days with median baseline and follow-up CXR scores of 4.0 (3-5) and 0.0 (0-1) respectively. 32% of patients had persistent CXR abnormality at 12-weeks. In multivariate analysis length of stay (LOS), smoking-status and obesity were identified as independent risk factors for persistent CXR abnormality.

Design/methodology/approach: Multiple linear regression models evaluate the socio-economic factors that determine COVID-19 deaths in the two groups of countries. The Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition is used to examine sources of differences between these two groups. Findings: Low-income countries report a significantly lower average number of COVID-19 deaths compared to high-income countries. Community mobility and the easiness of carrying the virus from one place to another are significant factors affecting the number of deaths, while life expectancy is only significant in high-income countries. Higher health expenditure is associated with more reported deaths in both high- and low-income countries. Factors such as the transport infrastructure system, life expectancy and the percent of expenditure on health lead to the differences in the number of deaths between high- and low-income countries. Social implications: Our study shows that mobility measures taken by individuals to limit the spread of the virus are important to prevent deaths in both high- and low-income countries. Additionally, our results suggest that countries with weak health institutions underestimate the number of deaths from COVID-19, especially low-income countries. The underestimation of COVID-19 deaths could be affecting a great number of people in poverty in low-income economies.

We conducted time-resolved sampling during a storm event at the Ammer River, Southwest Germany, which is representative for small river systems in densely populated areas of temperate climate. From two sampling sites suspended particulate matter (SPM) and water were separately analyzed by a multi-analyte LC-MS-MS method for 97 environmentally relevant organic micropollutants and with two in-vitro bioassays. Oxidative stress response (AREc32) may become activated by various stressors covering a broad range of physico-chemical properties and aryl hydrocarbon receptor induction (AhR-CALUX) by hydrophobic compounds such as dioxins and dioxin-like molecules. Compound numbers, concentrations, their mass fluxes and associated effect fluxes increased substantially during the storm event. Micropollutants detected in water and on SPM pointed towards inputs from combined sewer overflow (e.g., caffeine, paracetamol), urban runoff (e.g., mecoprop, terbutryn) and agricultural areas (e.g., azoxystrobin, bentazone). Particle-facilitated transport of triphenylphosphate and tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate accounted for up to 34 and 33% of the total mass flux despite SPM concentrations below 1 g L-1 . Effect fluxes attributed to SPM were similar or higher than in the water phase. The important role of SPM-bound transport emphasizes the need to consider not only concentrations but also mass and effect fluxes for surface water quality assessment and wastewater/stormwater treatment options.

The bifunctional nsp14 contains 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) and guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domains. While the latter presumably supports mRNA capping, ExoN is thought to mediate proofreading during genome replication. In line with such a role, ExoN knockout mutants of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were previously reported to have crippled but viable hypermutation phenotypes. Remarkably, using reverse genetics, a large set of corresponding ExoN knockout mutations has now been found to be lethal for another betacoronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). For 13 mutants, viral progeny could not be recovered, unless-as happened occasionally-reversion had first occurred. Only a single mutant was viable, likely because its E191D substitution is highly conservative. Remarkably, a SARS-CoV-2 ExoN knockout mutant was found to be unable to replicate, resembling observations previously made for alpha- and gammacoronaviruses, but starkly contrasting with the documented phenotype of ExoN knockout mutants of the closely related SARS-CoV. Subsequently, we established in vitro assays with purified recombinant MERS-CoV nsp14 to monitor its ExoN and N7-MTase activities. All ExoN knockout mutations that proved lethal in reverse genetics were found to severely decrease ExoN activity while not affecting N7-MTase activity. Our study strongly suggests that CoV nsp14 ExoN has an additional function, which apparently is critical for primary viral RNA synthesis and thus differs from the proofreading function that, based on previous MHV and SARS-CoV studies, was proposed to boost longer-term replication fidelity.IMPORTANCE The bifunctional nsp14 subunit of the coronavirus replicase contains 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) and guanine-N7-methyltransferase domains. For the betacoronaviruses MHV and SARS-CoV, ExoN was reported to promote the fidelity of genome replication, presumably by mediating a form of proofreading. For these viruses, ExoN knockout mutants are viable while displaying an increased mutation frequency. Strikingly, we have now established that the equivalent ExoN knockout mutants of two other betacoronaviruses, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, are nonviable, suggesting an additional and critical ExoN function in their replication. This is remarkable in light of the very limited genetic distance between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which is highlighted, for example, by 95% amino acid sequence identity in their nsp14 sequences. For (recombinant) MERS-CoV nsp14, both its enzymatic activities were evaluated using newly developed in vitro assays that can be used to characterize these key replicative enzymes in more detail and explore their potential as target for antiviral drug development.","Ogando, Natacha S; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C; van der Meer, Yvonne; Bredenbeek, Peter J; Posthuma, Clara C; Snijder, Eric J",J. virol,,772
323200,Examination of service quality of digital payments among working professionals,2021,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) stand out for their large RNA genome and complex RNA-synthesizing machinery comprising 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). The bifunctional nsp14 contains 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) and guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domains. While the latter presumably supports mRNA capping, ExoN is thought to mediate proofreading during genome replication. In line with such a role, ExoN knockout mutants of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were previously reported to have crippled but viable hypermutation phenotypes. Remarkably, using reverse genetics, a large set of corresponding ExoN knockout mutations has now been found to be lethal for another betacoronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). For 13 mutants, viral progeny could not be recovered, unless-as happened occasionally-reversion had first occurred. Only a single mutant was viable, likely because its E191D substitution is highly conservative.

324027,Leadership readiness in crisis context: Health preservation through shared knowledge,2020,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The COVID-19 disease, which was declared epidemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), is a global emergency public health problem. Patients with extrapulmonary symptoms are the group of patients who should be considered for person-to-person transmission in the community. In our study, it was aimed to investigate the characteristics of patients with COVID-19-related diarrhea symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted retrospectively in COVID-19 rtRT-PCR-positive patients in five medical centers. 3 or more loose/liquid stools per day or increased number of defecations compared to normal defecation were defined as diarrhea. The patients were analyzed in two groups as those with and without diarrhea. RESULTS: 1086 patients were included in the study. 78 (7.2%) of the patients had diarrhea. Diarrhea was watery in 54 (69.2%) patients while with blood and mucus in 18 (23.1%) patients. Diarrhea continued for an average of 5.2±1.6 (2-11) days. The clinical and laboratory findings of patients with diarrhea were more serious than those without diarrhea. Diarrhea is more common in the elderly and people with comorbid disease, and patients with diarrhea had higher CMI score and CRP and higher complaints of fever, cough, shortness of breath, myalgia and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of diarrhea should indicate a suspected COVID-19 infection and suggest testing for early diagnosis of the disease. It should be kept in mind that the course of the disease may be more severe in these patients and precautions should also be taken in terms of fecal transmission during discharge.","Comoglu, Senol; Öztürk, Sinan; Kant, Aydin; Arslan, Mustafa; Karakoc, Hanife Nur; Yilmaz, Gürdal",Dig. dis,,772

335806,Engaging Students During Synchronous Video-Conferencing in COVID19 Times: Preliminary Findings from a Design Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) regarding the COVID-19 among frontline healthcare workers (F-HCWs) working at different hospitals in Nepal and to identify the factors significantly associated with KAP. METHODS: We used a web-based survey, and a convenience sampling method was adopted to collect data from 603 F-HCWs working at different hospitals in Nepal during the first week of June 2020. A self-administered questionnaire was utilized to assess the KAP perceived by the F-HCWs. It was divided into 4-parts consisting of 30-items, demographic characteristics (10-items), knowledge (10-items), attitude (5-items), and practice (5-items). It consisted of both multiple-choice questions and Likert scale items questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the participants, 76% reported adequate knowledge, 54.7% reported positive attitude, and 78.9% reported appropriate practice. Statistically significant differences regarding the perceived level of knowledge among F-HCWs were observed among independent variables, including age, gender, level of education, marital status, profession, work experience, source of information, infection prevention and control (IPC) training, and online course(p < 0.05). Similarly, statistically significant differences regarding the attitude among F-HCWs were observed among independent variables, including age, gender, level of education, profession, and online course(p < 0.05). Moreover, only 2-independent variables, including the profession and online course, showed statistically significant differences with practice(p < 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant association between knowledge, attitude and practice at the level of p = 0.01. The factors significantly associated with adequate knowledge were male gender, nurse and doctor, websites and IPC training. Similarly, factors significantly associated with positive attitude were online course related to COVID-19 only. Moreover, factors significantly associated with appropriate practice were master's degree or above and online course related to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: F-HCWs reported adequate overall knowledge with a positive attitude and adopted the appropriate practice. The experienced F-HCWs with higher education and who received IPC training and online course regarding COVID-19 had better KAP. So, the stakeholders must arrange the educational programs and training for F-HCWs for better preparedness tackling with COVID-19.","Tamang, Nira; Rai, Punam; Dhungana, Siddhartha; Sherchan, Binod; Shah, Bikash; Pyakurel, Prajjwal; Rai, Saroj",BMC Public Health,,772

348172,"Augmented reality blended learning instruction: The impact on growing motivation, attitudes, and knowledge in 3D geometry",2021,"The spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a high risk of infection in hospitals worldwide. The medical staff in emergency rooms, in particular, have borne the brunt of the pandemic, and strict protection measures are needed to avoid infection in these units. Taiwan as a whole has performed extremely well in this epidemic, an achievement that has been acknowledged internationally. This success can be attributed to the Taiwan Epidemic Prevention Management Center's extensive experience and courageous strategy. The emergency department professionals of all hospitals, in conjunction with the outstanding performance of the center's policy, have also done much to control the infection's spread. However, excessive protection can also negatively affect patients' safety and the quality of medical care, especially for pregnant and parturient women. This article uses two actual cases from a medical center in northern Taiwan to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women. This case study serves to highlight that, to ensure more effective coordination during severe epidemics, a comprehensive infection prevention plan should be formulated. In addition, pregnant women's human rights must be safeguarded so that various protective mechanisms can be effectively used to achieve win-win solutions. Hospitals need to plan their production methods and timing in advance for when pregnant patients are in critical condition. The findings include that obstetricians recommend caesarean sections as a safer method in during epidemics. Emergency room physicians and obstetricians should also actively assist mothers prepare for birth to enhance maternal and fetal safety.","Chang, Wen-Han",Taiwan J Obstet Gynecol,,772

Government reactions varied in different countries. In Malta, the authorities took immediate action, assessments scaling of the potential public health threat. The article aims to briefly outline Malta's pandemic preparedness while describing the processes and purchases to face this pandemic. Costings for this exercise in risk mitigation were estimated as a percentage of the country's gross domestic product and the national budget. RESULTS: Among many actions, the Intensive Care facilities were ramped up from 20 beds in one area to 100 beds in five areas. Up to 600 extra COVID-19 beds for severely ill patients were also catered for, in addition to creation of several swabbing centers. The Central Procurement and Supplies Department (CPSU) was responsible for the sourcing and distribution of all protective wear and equipment across the country for all Government departments. CPSU was also involved in sourcing alternative clinical locations to house COVID-19 positive patients. In Malta, COVID-19 preparations cost at least 100 million, that is 1.9% of total anticipated government expenditure for 2020. CONCLUSION: The local pandemic preparation ran smoothly apart from a number of hitches that were dealt with swiftly and efficiently, displaying an agility and nimbleness. Malta has been fortunate in that the Government, advised by Public Health, reacted swiftly in order to control local spread. The silver lining is that these preparations and the preparedness exercise will serve in good stead in the setting of future pandemics.","Grech, Victor; Cuschieri, Sarah; Grech, Peter; Farrugia, Ing Karl; Gauci, Charmaine",Early Hum Dev,,772
352316,Determination of seed plant in Jepara’s urban farming during the pandemic Covid 19,2021,"Background: In the context of the COVID-19-pandemic, mortality and incidence are key determinants to assess the transmission dynamics and the resulting potential threat. Systematic microbiological monitoring of deaths provides a fundamental basis to particularly assess underrecording of community-acquired mortality. It should be further elucidated whether a death cohort of previously unreported cases may be structurally different from the cohort of officially registered cases. Methods: A systematic reverse transcription (RT) qPCR testing for SARS-CoV­2 infections from nasopharyngeal swab samples was carried out. A representative sample of corpses from crematoria and the Institute of Legal Medicine of the Federal State of Hamburg were included. A comparative analysis of primarily reported and unreported fatalities in an 8­week period after occurrence of the first pandemic-related deaths in Hamburg was performed. Results: A total of 1231 deaths were included, all of which were previously unsuspicious for SARS-CoV­2 infection. Thereof 29 cases of previously unknown infections were recorded. In the first phase of the pandemic, incidental findings predominantly occurred among younger people from domestic environments with unclear or unnatural manner of death at the Institute of Legal Medicine. Over time, incidental findings investigated at the crematoria increased, mostly related to nursing home residents. The overall cohort showed no significant sociodemographic differences to a comparative collective of known SARS-CoV­2-associated deaths. Primarily unreported cases showed a significantly lower proportion of COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death. Conclusion: A systematic PCR-based monitoring of deaths allows a more targeted detection and classification of SARS-CoV­2 positive cases. A preventive contribution can be made by disclosing unreported pandemic-related cases of death.","Klein, Anke; Langenwalder, Felicia; Heinrich, Fabian; Meißner, Kira; Schröder, Ann Sophie; Püschel, Klaus; Ondruschka, Benjamin; Lütgehetmann, Marc; Heinemann, Axel",Rechtsmedizin (Berl),,772
354046,Economic mechanism for decomposition of results of scientific and technical activities,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: COVID-19 has put the in-vitro-diagnostic community under an unprecedented spotlight, with a global requirement for accurate SARS-CoV-2 tests. This review will outline technological responses to this need and the analytical considerations required for their translation to routine use. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic solutions directly detect the virus or measure host-derived surrogate markers of infection. With pressure upon supply chains for the 'traditional' molecular approaches, a wide variety of analytical tools spanning the molecular, serology, imaging and chemistry space are being developed, including high throughput solutions and simplified near-patient formats. SUMMARY: The unique genetic nature of SARS-CoV-2 means high analytical specificity is achievable by most diagnostic formats. However, clinical sensitivity assessment is complicated by wide discrepancies in analytical range and challenges associated with standardising these differences. When coupled with the acute nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection, reported precise metrics of test performance must be questioned. The response to SARS-CoV-2 has delivered considerable diagnostic innovation, but for a technology to be maximised, it must be demonstrably reproducible and fit for purpose. If novel diagnostic solutions for SARS-CoV-2 are to succeed, equally innovative mechanisms are needed to ensure widespread clinical and surveillance application, enabling agreed standards and metrics to ensure comparability.","Huggett, Jim F; Moran-Gilad, Jacob; Lee, J Eugene",Curr Opin Pulm Med,,772

359167,The Ivory Tower Lost: How College Students Respond Differently than the General Public to the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Synthetic modified messenger RNA (mRNA) has manifested great potentials for therapeutic applications such as vaccines and gene therapies, with the recent mRNA vaccines for global pandemic COVID-19 (corona virus disease 2019) attracting the tremendous attention. The chemical modifications and delivery vehicles of synthetic mRNAs are the two key factors for their in vivo therapeutic applications. Chemical modifications like nucleoside methylation endow the synthetic mRNAs with high stability and reduced stimulation of innate immunity. The development of scalable production of synthetic mRNA and efficient mRNA formulation and delivery strategies in recent years have remarkably advanced the field. It is worth noticing that we had limited knowledge on the roles of mRNA modifications in the past. However, the last decade has witnessed not only new discoveries of several naturally occurring mRNA modifications but also substantial advances in understanding their roles on regulating gene expression. It is highly necessary to reconsider the therapeutic system made by synthetic modified mRNAs and delivery vectors. In this review, we will mainly discuss the roles of various chemical modifications on synthetic mRNAs, briefly summarize the progresses of mRNA delivery strategies, and highlight some latest mRNA therapeutics applications including infectious disease vaccines, cancer immunotherapy, mRNA-based genetic reprogramming and protein replacement, mRNA-based gene editing. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The development of synthetic mRNA drug holds great promise but lies behind small molecule and protein drugs largely due to the challenging issues regarding its stability, immunogenicity and potency. In the last 15 years, these issues have beensubstantially addressed by synthesizing chemically modified mRNA and developing powerful delivery systems; the mRNA therapeutics has entered an exciting new era begun with the approved mRNA vaccines for the COVID-19 infection disease. Here, we provide recent progresses in understanding the biological roles of various RNA chemical modifications, in developing mRNA delivery systems, and in advancing the emerging mRNA-based therapeutic applications, with the purpose to inspire the community to spawn new ideas for curing diseases.","Gao, Minsong; Zhang, Qingyi; Feng, Xin-Hua; Liu, Jianzhao",Acta biomater,,772

368748,"Methodology to improve the teaching of mathematical theories in schoolchildren, through the use of programming techniques",2021,"Natural selection operating on the genomes of viral pathogens in different host species strongly contributes to adaptation facilitating host colonization. Here, we analyse, quantify and compare viral adaptation in genomic sequence data derived from seven zoonotic events in the Coronaviridae family among primary, intermediate and human hosts. Rates of nonsynonymous (dN ) and synonymous (dS ) changes on specific amino acid positions were quantified for each open reading frame (ORF). Purifying selection accounted for 77% of all sites under selection. Diversifying selection was most frequently observed in viruses infecting the primary hosts of each virus and predominantly occurred in the orf1ab genomic region. Within all four intermediate hosts, diversifying selection on the spike gene was observed either solitarily or in combination with orf1ab and other genes. Consistent with previous evidence, pervasive diversifying selection on coronavirus spike genes corroborates the role this protein plays in host cellular entry, adaptation to new hosts and evasion of host cellular immune responses. Structural modelling of spike proteins identified a significantly higher proportion of sites for SARS-CoV-2 under positive selection in close proximity to sites of glycosylation relative to the other coronaviruses. Among human coronaviruses, there was a significant inverse correlation between the number of sites under positive selection and the estimated years since the virus was introduced into the human population. Abundant diversifying selection observed in SARS-CoV-2 suggests the virus remains in the adaptive phase of the host switch, typical of recent host switches. A mechanistic understanding of where, when and how genomic adaptation occurs in coronaviruses following a host shift is crucial for vaccine design, public health responses and predicting future pandemics.","Montoya, Vincent; McLaughlin, Angela; Mordecai, Gideon J; Miller, Rachel L; Joy, Jeffrey B",J Evol Biol,,772

383816,IoT based scanner for corona detection,2021,"PURPOSE: To assess tomographic ganglion cell complex changes in patients with diabetic macular edema treated with intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF). METHODS: We analyzed data from 35 eyes of 35 previously untreated patients in whom diabetic macular edema improved after three loading doses of anti-VEGF injection and who did not receive repeated injections. We recorded spectral domain-optical coherence tomography assessments of ganglion cell complex and central macular thickness at baseline and monthly for three months, and on the sixth and ninth month after treatment. We compared the results with those of the unaffected eyes in the same patients and with those in a control group of patients with diabetic macular edema who were untreated. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients in the treatment group was 60 ± 4.38 years. The foveal thicknesses measured using optical coherence tomography decreased significantly from baseline to the third month post-injection (p<0.05). The mean ganglion cell complex thickness was 115.08 ± 16.72 µm before the first injection and 101.05 ± 12.67 µm after the third injection (p<0.05). The mean ganglion cell complex was 110.04 ± 15.07 µm on the sixth month (p>0.05) and 113.12 ± 11.15 µm on the ninth month (p>0.05). We found a significant difference between the patients and the control group in terms of mean ganglion cell complex thickness on the second- and third-months post-injection (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the ganglion cell complex thickness in patients with diabetic macular edema decreased after the anti-VEGF injections. We cannot ascertain whether the ganglion cell complex thickness decreases were due to effects of the anti-VEGF agents or to the natural disease course.","Ciloglu, Emine; Unal, Fikret; Dogan, Nese Cetin",Arq Bras Oftalmol,,772
385939,Literature Study: Utilization of Android-Based Learning Media Using Adobe Flash CS 6 (As An Educational Solution During The Covid-19 Pandemic),2021,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has undoubtedly created an emerging disease of topmost public health priority spilling throughout the globe. The diagnosis currently relies on a multiplex of criteria including the epidemiology, clinical manifestations and in vitro diagnostics. Presently, the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is considered as the most reliable assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and is being supplemented by other auxiliary tests, including serology and radiology. Many of these molecular and immunological tests have been validated by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and commercial kits have been introduced in the field. But, considering the sensitivity and specificity based shortcomings and the lacunae in monitoring the spread of the virus, there is an immense need to develop integrated smart devices based on novel, safe, rapid and accurate diagnostic techniques and implement them on a large scale to curb this outbreak in the country and the world as a whole.

This paper further explores the promotion impact of government subsidies on NEV diffusion, and establishes a three-stage evolutionary game model. Based on the actual application, the NEV diffusion process is simulated in four kinds of authoritative networks. Results show that: (1) in the scale-free network, the subsidy rate must be high enough to promote full NEV diffusion, and the larger the network scale, the higher the threshold of subsidy rate;(2) in the small-world network, the larger the network scale, the more beneficial it is for full NEV diffusion;(3) for the small-scale network, topological characteristics have little effect on NEV diffusion depth, and only affect the speed when NEV diffusion reaches the stable state;(4) for the large-scale network, NEV diffusion in the scale-free network is more sensitive to the subsidy rate than that in the small-world network;(5) network topologies influencing NEV diffusion can be divided into two priorities. Finally, relevant policy recommendations are presented.","Zhao, Dan Ji Shou-feng Wang He-ping Jiang Li-wen",Energy,,772

METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 individuals attending the Galway-Roscommon Mental Health Services with an ICD-10 diagnosis of an anxiety disorder at two-time points (six-months apart) to determine the impact of the Covid-19 restrictions on anxiety and depressive symptoms, social and occupational functioning and quality of life. RESULTS: No statistical difference in symptomatology was noted between the two time points in relation to anxiety symptoms as measured utilising psychometric rating scales (BAI, HARS) or utilising a Likert Scale. The greatest impact of COVID-19 at both time points related to social functioning and quality of life. Significant variability was noted for individual participants. Qualitative analysis noted social isolation, concern for the participants' future and increased difficulty managing anxiety with ongoing restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: No significant overall change in symptomatology or functioning over time was noted for individuals with pre-existing anxiety disorders. Variability was however demonstrated between individuals, with some individuals describing ongoing anxiety, social isolation and concern for their future. Identifying those with ongoing symptoms or distress and providing multidisciplinary support to this cohort is suggested.","Hennigan, K; McGovern, M; Plunkett, R; Costello, S; McDonald, C; Hallahan, B",Ir J Psychol Med,,772

406584,An Analysis of the Effectiveness of Emergency Distance Learning under COVID-19,2020,"Activation of the complement system has been observed in coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with meta-regression to investigate possible differences in the serum concentrations of two routinely measured complement components, C3 and C4, in COVID-19 patients with different severity and survival status. We searched PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus, between January 2020 and February 2021, for studies reporting serum complement C3 and C4, measures of COVID-19 severity, and survival. Eligibility criteria were a) reporting continuous data on serum C3 and C4 concentrations in COVID-19 patients, -b) investigating COVID-19 patients with different disease severity and/or survival status, c) adult patients, d) English language, e) &#8805;10 patients, and f) full-text available. Using a random-effects model, standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate differences in serum C3 and C4 concentrations between COVID-19 patients with low vs. high severity or survivor vs. non-survivor status. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale whereas publication bias was assessed with the Begg's and Egger's tests. Certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. Nineteen studies in 3,764 COVID-19 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Both C3 and C4 concentrations were significantly lower in patients with high disease severity or non-survivor status than patients with low severity or survivor status (C3 SMD=-0.40, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.21, p<0.001; C4 SMD=-0.29, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.09, p=0.005; moderate certainty of evidence). Extreme between-study heterogeneity was observed (C3, I2 = 82.1%; C4, I2 = 84.4%). Sensitivity analysis, performed by sequentially removing each study and re-assessing the pooled estimates, showed that the magnitude and direction of the effect size was not modified. There was no publication bias. In meta-regression, the SMD of C3 was significantly associated with white blood cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and pro-thrombin time, whereas the SMD of C4 was significantly associated with CRP, pro-thrombin time, D-dimer, and albumin. In conclusion, lower concentrations of C3 and C4, indicating complement activation, were significantly associated with higher COVID-19 severity and mortality. C3 and C4 might be useful to predict adverse clinical consequences in these patients.

411190,Psychological support application using the real-time WebRTC: A case study of undergraduate in Malaysian and Indonesian higher learning institutions,2021,"BACKGROUND: A carboxypeptidase protein called ACE2 is found in many organs. ACE2 protein can play a pivotal role to regulate the pathological changes of several diseases including COVID-19. TMPRSS2 gene is expressed in many human tissues and plays a critical role in spreading the infection of the viruses including coronavirus and progression of prostate cancer, and hence could be used as a potential drug target. There are limited reports on occurrence of genetic polymorphism of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in general population, expressions in pathological conditions, and its impact on COVID-19 disease. Hence we comprehended the occurrence of ACE2, TMPRSS2 polymorphism in general population, expression in various diseases and its impact on COVID-19 disease. METHOD: We utilized multiple databases, PubMed (Medline), EMBASE and Google Scholar for literature search. DESCRIPTION: ACE2 polymorphisms have significant linkages with various diseases, including severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Genetic variations of these genes contribute to individual's genetic susceptibility to viral infection and its subsequent clearance. The diversity and variations in the population distribution of these genes, might greatly influence and in turn reflect into the observed population and gender differences of the severity and clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: There are diversities in distribution of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 polymorphisms among different populations. Analyzing the genetic variants and expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes, in a population may provide the genetic marker for susceptibility or resistance against the coronavirus infection, which might be useful for identifying the susceptible population groups for targeted interventions and for making relevant public health policy decisions.","Singh, HariOm; Choudhari, Ranjana; Nema, Vijay; Khan, Abdul Arif",Microb Pathog,,772

Concerns with AMR have resulted in multiple initiatives internationally, na-tionally and regionally to enhance appropriate antibiotic utilization across sectors to reduce AMR, with the overuse of antibiotics exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Effectively tackling AMR is crucial for all countries. Principally a narrative review of ongoing activities across sectors was undertaken to improve antimicrobial use and address issues with vaccines including COVID-19. Point prevalence surveys have been successful in hospitals to identify areas for quality improvement programs, principally centering on antimicrobial stewardship programs. These include reducing prolonged antibiotic use to prevent surgical site infections. Multiple activities centering on education have been successful in reducing inappropriate prescribing and dispensing of antimicrobials in ambulatory care for essentially viral infections such as acute respiratory infections. It is imperative to develop new quality indicators for ambulatory care given current concerns, and instigate programs with clear public health messaging to reduce misinformation, essential for pandemics. Regular access to effective treatments is needed to reduce resistance to treatments for HIV, malaria and tuberculosis. Key stakeholder groups can instigate multiple initiatives to reduce AMR.

Several clinical factors relevant to the noncritically ill hospitalized child significantly increase the risk of VTE including the presence of central venous catheters, systemic inflammation, and prolonged immobilization. Although risk mitigation strategies have been described, the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of VTE require standardization of institutional practices combined with multidisciplinary collaboration among pediatric hospitalists, hematologists, and other care providers. In this narrative review, we summarize the epidemiology of VTE, risk models identifying high-risk conditions associated with VTE, and prevention and treatment strategies. We further describe successful quality improvement efforts implementing institutional VTE risk stratification and thromboprophylaxis procedures. Finally, we highlight unique challenges facing pediatric hospital medicine specialists in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, including caring for adults admitted to pediatric hospital units, and describe future research opportunities for VTE in the noncritically ill hospitalized child.","Morrison, John M; Betensky, Marisol; Kiskaddon, Amy L; Goldenberg, Neil A",Semin. thromb. hemost,,772

How to choose a suitable alternative supplier in the COVID-19 pandemic has become an important task. To fulfill this task, this research proposes a calibrated fuzzy geometric mean (cFGM)-fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS)-fuzzy weighted intersection (FWI) approach. In the proposed methodology, first, the cFGM method is proposed to accurately derive the priorities of criteria. Subsequently, each expert applies the FTOPSIS method to compare the overall performances of alternative suppliers in the COVID-19 pandemic. The sensitivity of an expert to any change in the overall performance of the alternative supplier is also considered. Finally, the FWI operator is used to aggregate the comparison results by all experts, for which an expert's authority level is set to a value proportional to the consistency of his/her pairwise comparison results. The cFGM-FTOPSIS-FWI approach has been applied to select suitable alternative suppliers for a Taiwanese foundry in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Toly; Wang, Yu-Cheng; Wu, Hsin-Chieh",,,772

Here, using atomistic simulation, a plausible mechanism has been delineated. In G614 sgp but not wild type, increased D(G)614-T859 C&#945;-distance within 65 ns is interpreted as S1/S2 protomer dissociation. Overall, ACE2-binding, post-fusion core, open-state and sub-optimal antibody-binding conformations were preferentially sampled by the G614 mutant, but not wild type. Furthermore, in the wild type, only one of the three sgp chains has optimal communication route between residue 614 and the receptor-binding domain (RBD); whereas, two of the three chains communicated directly in G614 mutant. These data provide evidence that D614G sgp mutant is more available for receptor binding, cellular invasion and reduced antibody interaction; thus, providing framework for enhanced fitness and higher transmissibility in D614G SARS-COV-2 mutant.","Omotuyi, I Olaposi; Nash, Oyekanmi; Ajiboye, O Basiru; Iwegbulam, C Gift; Oyinloye, E Babatunji; Oyedeji, O Abimbola; Kashim, Z Abimbola; Okaiyeto, Kunle",J Comput Chem,,772

In this context, the neutron skin thickness of 208Pb (Rskin) provides the most stringent laboratory constraint on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. In turn, the cleanest and most precise value of Rskin has been reported recently by the PREX collaboration. Exploiting the strong correlation between Rskin and the slope of the symmetry energy (L) we report a value of L=(109.56 +/- 36.41)MeV -- that systematically overestimates current limits based on both theoretical approaches and experimental measurements. The impact of such a stiff symmetry energy on some critical neutron-star observables is also examined.","Reed, Brendan T.; Fattoyev, F. J.; Horowitz, C.

Before evaluating the efficacy and safety of this novel therapeutic strategy in humans, its characterization is required. The developed 65° ethanol formulation is stable at room temperature and protected from light for 15 days, maintaining its physicochemical and microbiological properties. Two oxygen flows have been tested for its administration (2 and 3 L/min) using an automated headspace gas chromatographic analysis technique (HS-GC-MS), with that of 2 L/min being the most appropriate one, ensuring the inhalation of an ethanol daily dose of 33.6 ± 3.6 mg/min and achieving more stable concentrations during the entire treatment (45 min). Under these conditions of administration, the formulation has proven to be safe, based on histological studies of the respiratory tracts and lungs of rats. On the other hand, these results are accompanied by the first preclinical molecular imaging study with radiolabeled ethanol administered by this route. The current ethanol formulation has received approval from the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices for a phase II clinical trial for early-stage COVID-19 patients, which is currently in the recruitment phase (ALCOVID-19; EudraCT number: 2020-001760-29).","Castro-Balado, Ana; Mondelo-García, Cristina; Barbosa-Pereira, Letricia; Varela-Rey, Iria; Novo-Veleiro, Ignacio; Vázquez-Agra, Néstor; Antúnez-López, José Ramón; Bandín-Vilar, Enrique José; Sendón-García, Raquel; Busto-Iglesias, Manuel; Rodríguez-Bernaldo de Quirós, Ana; García-Quintanilla, Laura; González-Barcia, Miguel; Zarra-Ferro, Irene; Otero-Espinar, Francisco J; Rey-Bretal, David; Lago-Quinteiro, José Ramón; Valdés-Cuadrado, Luis; Rábade-Castedo, Carlos; Del Río-Garma, María Carmen; Crespo-Diz, Carlos; Delgado-Sánchez, Olga; Aguiar, Pablo; Barbeito-Castiñeiras, Gema; Pérez Del Molino-Bernal, María Luisa; Trastoy-Pena, Rocío; Passannante, Rossana; Llop, Jordi; Pose-Reino, Antonio; Fernández-Ferreiro, Anxo",,,772

Dental monitoring (DM) is a recently introduced orthodontic application that combines safe teledentistry with artificial intelligence (AI) using a knowledge-based algorithm, allowing an accurate semi-automatic monitoring of the treatment. Dental Monitoring is the world's first SaaS (Software as a Service) application designed for remote monitoring of dental treatment, developed in Paris, France, with Philippe Salah as the Co-founder and CEO. CASES PRESENTATION: This report describes two cases in which DM system was essential to achieve the control of certain movements: it was possible to follow the movement, even if complex, such as the anterior cross of an adult patient and a lack of space in the canine of the growing patient. The software analyzed the fit and retention of the aligner, thus ensuring correct biomechanics. They were treated during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown with aligners. The first case is a growing patient who was monitored during an interceptive orthodontic treatment to manage a retained upper canine. The second case is an adult patient forced to finalize his treatment of upper lateral incisor crossbite. The software analyzed the fit and retention of the aligner, thus ensuring correct biomechanics. CONCLUSIONS: DM system appears to be a promising method, useful for improving the interaction between doctor and patient, generally acceptable and useful to patients, even in critical clinical situations, at least in cases with optimal compliance and ability to use the tool properly.","Caruso, Silvia; Caruso, Sara; Pellegrino, Marianna; Skafi, Rayan; Nota, Alessandro; Tecco, Simona",Sensors (Basel),,772

Most of the evaluated drugs against SARS-CoV-2 derive from drug repurposing of Food and Drug Administration-approved molecules. These drugs have as target three major processes: (1) early stages of virus-cell interaction, (2) viral proteases, and (3) the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. SUMMARY: This review focused on the basic principles of virology and pharmacology to understand the importance of early stages of virus-cell interaction as therapeutic targets and other main processes vital for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Furthermore, we focused on describing the main targets associated with SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapy and the rationale of drug combinations for efficiently suppressing viral replication. Key Messages: We hypothesized that blocking of both entry mechanisms could allow a more effective antiviral effect compared to the partial results obtained with chloroquine or its derivatives alone. This approach, already used to achieve an antiviral effect higher than that offered by every single drug administered separately, has been successfully applied in several viral infections such as HIV and HCV. This review will contribute to expanding the perception of the possible therapeutic targets in SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight the benefits of using combination therapies.","Ortega, Joseph T; Zambrano, Jose L; Jastrzebska, Beata; Liprandi, Ferdinando; Rangel, Hector R; Pujol, Flor H",Intervirology,,772

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies with comparison data on SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19 during pregnancy. We searched for eligible studies in MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, medRxiv and Cochrane databases up to Jan. 29, 2021, using Medical Subject Headings terms and keywords for ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR coronavirus disease 2019 OR COVID-19"" AND ""pregnancy."" We evaluated the methodologic quality of all included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Our primary outcomes were preeclampsia and preterm birth. Secondary outcomes included stillbirth, gestational diabetes and other pregnancy outcomes. We calculated summary odds ratios (ORs) or weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: We included 42 studies involving 438 548 people who were pregnant. Compared with no SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, COVID-19 was associated with preeclampsia (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.73), preterm birth (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.39) and stillbirth (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.90).

Materials and Methods: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, the authors performed a systematic literature review, using three databases to assess laboratory data of COVID-19-confirmed cases, and the articles that described significant laboratory irregularities were ultimately chosen. Crosschecking was performed on the references of these articles in order to identify further studies. The statistical software R version 3.6.1 was used for meta-analysis of COVID-19 studies. Results: A total of 13 relevant articles were included. They yielded a total of 2662 individuals who tested positive for COVID-19. The analysis results demonstrated that male patients comprised a more substantial proportion, accounting for 57.9% of the total. The principal laboratory findings of the COVID-19 patients indicated that they commonly had lymphocytopenia 0.943 (confidence interval [CI]: 0.857-1.03), high D-dimer 0.459 (CI: 0.237-0.6808), high procalcitonin 0.089 (CI: 0.066-0.111), high C-reactive protein 17.203 (CI: 6.520-27.886), and high lactate dehydrogenase 278.265 (CI: 238.995-317.535). Conclusions: Infection with COVID-19 is associated with significant laboratory irregularities. The increased focus must be applied to laboratory parameters to quickly identify a large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers, prevent virus transmission, and assure timely treatment of patients, particularly in regions characterized by limited resources.","Abdulla, S.

This virus rapidly spread around the world causing disease ranging from minimal symptoms to severe pneumonia, which was termed coronavirus disease (i.e., COVID). Postmortem examination is a valuable tool for studying the pathobiology of this new infection. METHODS: We report the clinicopathologic findings from 32 autopsy studies conducted on patients who died of COVID-19 including routine gross and microscopic examination with applicable special and immunohistochemical staining techniques. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR in 31 cases (97%) and by immunohistochemical staining for SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein in the lung in the remaining 1 case (3%). The ethnically diverse cohort consisted of 22 males and 10 females with a mean age of 68 years (range: 30-100). Patients most commonly presented with cough (17 [55%]), shortness of breath (26 [81%]), and a low-grade fever (17 [55%]). Thirty-one (97%) of the patients had at least 1 comorbidity (mean = 4). Twenty-eight patients (88%) had widespread thromboembolic disease, as well as diffuse alveolar damage (30 [94%]), diabetic nephropathy (17 [57%]) and acute tubular injury. Patterns of liver injury were heterogeneous, featuring 10 (36%) with frequent large basophilic structures in sinusoidal endothelium, and increased immunoblast-like cells in lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: This series of autopsies from patients with COVID-19 confirms the observation that the majority of severely affected patients have significant pulmonary pathology. However, many patients also have widespread microscopic thromboses, as well as characteristic findings in the liver and lymph nodes.","Elsoukkary, Sarah S; Mostyka, Maria; Dillard, Alicia; Berman, Diana R; Ma, Lucy X; Chadburn, Amy; Yantiss, Rhonda K; Jessurun, Jose; Seshan, Surya V; Borczuk, Alain C; Salvatore, Steven P",Pathobiology,,772

472354,Covid-19 outbreak modelling using regression techniques,2021,"Historically, the prone position was used almost exclusively in the ICU for patients suffering from refractory hypoxemia due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Amidst the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, however, this technique has been increasingly utilized in settings outside of the ICU, particularly in the emergency department. With emerging evidence that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who are not intubated and mechanically ventilated may benefit from the prone position, this strategy should not be isolated to only those with critical illness. This is a review of the pertinent physiology and evidence supporting prone positioning along with a step-by-step guide meant to familiarize those who are not already comfortable with the maneuver. Placing a patient in the prone position helps to improve ventilation-perfusion matching, dorsal lung recruitment, and ultimately gas exchange. Evidence also suggests there is improved oxygenation in both mechanically ventilated patients and those who are awake and spontaneously breathing, further reinforcing the utility of the prone position in non-ICU settings. Given present concerns about resource limitations because of the pandemic, prone positioning has especially demonstrable value as a technique to delay or even prevent intubation. Patients who are able to self-prone should be directed into the ''swimmer's position'' and then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position if further oxygenation is needed. If a mechanically ventilated patient is to be placed in the prone position, specific precautions should be taken to ensure the patient's safety and to prevent any unwanted sequelae of prone positioning.","McGurk, Kevin; Riveros, Toni; Johnson, Nicholas; Dyer, Sean",,,772

474275,E-learning in time of COVID-19 pandemic: Challenges & experiences,2020,"ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: To estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the state of Maranhão, Brazil. METHODS: A population-based household survey was performed, from July 27, 2020 to August 8, 2020. The estimates considered clustering, stratification and non-response. Qualitative detection of IgM and IgG antibodies was performed in a fully-automated Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on the Cobas® e601 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). RESULTS: In total, 3,156 individuals were interviewed. Seroprevalence of total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 40.4% (95%CI 35.6-45.3). Population adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions was higher at the beginning of the pandemic than in the last month. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were significantly lower among mask wearers and among those who maintained social and physical distancing in the last month compared to their counterparts. Among the infected, 26.0% were asymptomatic. The infection fatality rate (IFR) was 0.14%, higher for men and older adults. The IFR based on excess deaths was 0.28%. The ratio of estimated infections to reported cases was 22.2. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 estimated in this population-based survey is one of the highest reported. The local herd immunity threshold may have been reached or might be reached soon.","Silva, Antônio Augusto Moura da; Lima-Neto, Lídio Gonçalves; Azevedo, Conceição de Maria Pedrozo e Silva de; Costa, Léa Márcia Melo da; Bragança, Maylla Luanna Barbosa Martins; Barros Filho, Allan Kardec Duailibe; Wittlin, Bernardo Bastos; Souza, Bruno Feres de; Oliveira, Bruno Luciano Carneiro Alves de; Carvalho, Carolina Abreu de; Thomaz, Erika Barbara Abreu Fonseca; Simões-Neto, Eudes Alves; Leite Júnior, Jamesson Ferreira; Cosme, Lécia Maria Sousa Santos; Campos, Marcos Adriano Garcia; Queiroz, Rejane Christine de Sousa; Costa, Sérgio Souza; Carvalho, Vitória Abreu de; Simões, Vanda Maria Ferreira; Alves, Maria Teresa Seabra Soares de Brito e; Santos, Alcione Miranda dos",Rev. saúde pública (Online),,772

We felt this was a unique case as some cases of psoriatic arthropathy and reactive arthropathy but none, to our knowledge of non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. CASE PRESENTATION: Twenty one-year-old female presented in June 2020 with inflammatory symptoms with general work-up per primary care provider being negative. Upon further work-up per Rheumatology, felt to have inflammatory back pain with X-rays of SI joints showing grade II sclerosis. Further work-up including magnetic resonance imaging was positive demonstrating bone edema and erosions of SI joint. This prompted further investigation and she had had some vague symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 several months prior including loss of smell, fatigue, and malaise. SARS-CoV-2 semiquanitative antibodies where done that where high positive. She was treated with cetrolizumab and had prompt improvement over the course of the next week. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 triggering autoimmunity is still unknown at this time. However, it is important that insights be gained into the type of disease that can be triggered by this infection. As the pandemic continues to rage on, Rheumatologist need to be increasing aware that patients presenting with various forms of inflammatory arthritis may be triggered by an antecedent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Following these cases may help to determine how they differ from other forms of inflammatory arthropathy.","Saikali, Wassim; Gharib, Suzanne",Immun. Inflamm. Dis,,772

483351,Application of STEM-based online learning to train creative skills of students in covid-19 pandemic periods,2021,"BACKGROUND: The lab-confirmed interval is the date from lab confirmation in a core case (infector) to lab confirmation in a second case (infectee); however, its distribution and application are seldom reported. This study aimed to investigate the lab-confirmed interval and its application in the preliminary evaluation of the strength of disease prevention and control measures. METHODS: Taking European countries and Chinese provinces outside Hubei as examples, we identified 63 infector-infectee pairs from European countries from Wikipedia, and 103 infector-infectee pairs from official public sources in Chinese provinces outside Hubei. The lab-confirmed intervals were obtained through analysis of the collected data and adopting the bootstrap method. RESULTS: The mean lab-confirmed interval was 2.6 (95% CI: 2.1-3.1) days for Europe and 2.6 (95% CI: 1.9-3.3) days for China outside Hubei, which were shorter than the reported serial intervals. For index patients aged &#8805;60 years old, the lab-confirmed interval in Europe was slightly longer (mean: 2.9; 95% CI: 2.0-3.6) and obviously longer in China outside Hubei (mean: 3.8; 95% CI: 1.9-5.5) than that for patients aged < 60 years. CONCLUSION: Investigation of the lab-confirmed interval can provide additional information on the characteristics of emergent outbreaks and can be a feasible indication to evaluate the strength of prevention and control measures. When the lab-confirmed interval was shorter than the serial interval, it could objectively reflect improvements in laboratory capacity and the surveillance of close contacts.","Huang, Lihong; Wei, Liangmin; Jiang, Yue; Lin, Lijuan",BMC Infect Dis,,772

This work explores the perceptions of Spaniards with IDD during the lockdown with respect to four topics: access to information, emotional experiences, effects on living conditions and access to support. METHODS: The topics were explored using a subset of 16 closed-ended questions from an online survey. In total, 582 participants with IDD completed the survey. The frequencies and percentages of responses to the questions were calculated, and chi-square tests performed to explore the relationship between participants' sociodemographic characteristics and responses. Given that people differed in the way in which they completed the survey, the relationship between participants' responses and completion method was also analysed. RESULTS: Participants reported that the pandemic and subsequent lockdown have had a deleterious effect on their emotional well-being (around 60.0% of participants) and occupations (48.0% of students and 72.7% of workers). Although access to information and support was reportedly good overall, being under the age of 21 years and studying were associated with perceptions reflecting poorer access to information (V = .20 and V = .13, respectively) and well-being support (V = .15 and V = .13, respectively). Being supported by a third party to complete the survey was consistently related to perceptions of worse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The study yielded data on the perceptions of people with IDD regarding the effects that COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdown have had on their lives.

We describe a COVID-19 outbreak on our leukemia and stem cell transplantation unit (LSCT-Unit) originating from a patient with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. The patient was treated with intensive induction chemotherapy and we characterize the subsequent outbreak of COVID-19 on a LSCT-Unit. We describe the characteristics of the 36 contacts among the medical team, the results of their PCR and antibody tests and clinical aspects and features of infected employees. Of these 36 close contacts, 9 employees of the LSCT-Unit were infected and were tested positive by PCR and/or antibody-testing. 8/9 of them were symptomatic, 3/9 with severe, 5/9 with mild symptoms, and one person without symptoms. Due to stringent hygiene measures, the outbreak did not lead to infections of other patients despite ongoing clinical work. Moreover, we demonstrate that incubation period and clinical course of a COVID-19 infection in an immunosuppressed patient could be unusual compared to that of immunocompetent patients. Consistent PCR and antibody testing are helpful to understand, control, and prevent outbreaks. For the safety of health-care workers and patients alike, all employees wore FFP2 masks and were trained to adhere to several further safety guidelines. The implementation of rigorous hygiene measures is the key to controlling an outbreak and preventing infections of other patients.","Greiner, Jochen; Götz, Marlies; Malner-Wagner, Waltraud; Wendt, Constanze; Enders, Martin; Durst, Christine; Michel, Detlef; von Harsdorf, S; Jung, Susanne",Cancer Med,,772

With new cases of COVID-19 surging in the United States at that time, it became essential to better understand how the spread of COVID-19 was varying across all segments of the population. We used hierarchical exponential growth curve modeling techniques to examine whether community socioeconomic characteristics uniquely influence the incidence of reported COVID-19 cases in the urban built environment. We show that as of July 19, 2020, confirmed coronavirus infections in New York City and surrounding areas-one of the early epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States-were concentrated along demographic and socioeconomic lines. Furthermore, our data provides evidence that after the onset of the pandemic, timely enactment of physical distancing measures such as school closures was essential to limiting the extent of the coronavirus spread in the population.

516014,Improving the Methods for Visualization of Middle Ear Pathologies Based on Telemedicine Services in Remote Treatment,2020,"BACKGROUND: Currently, 2 coprimary end points are used by health authorities to determine the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in patients with Crohn's disease (CD): symptomatic remission (patient-reported outcome assessment) and endoscopic remission (ileocolonoscopy). However, there is lack of accepted biomarkers to facilitate regulatory decision-making in the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of CD. METHODS: With support from the Helmsley Charitable Trust, Critical Path Institute formed the Crohn's Disease Biomarkers preconsortium (CDBpC) with members from the pharmaceutical industry, academia, and nonprofit organizations to evaluate the CD biomarker landscape. Biomarkers were evaluated based on biological relevance, availability of biomarker assays, and clinical validation data. RESULTS: The CDBpC identified the most critical need as pharmacodynamic/response biomarkers to monitor disease activity in response to therapeutic intervention. Fecal calprotectin (FC) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were identified as biomarkers ready for the regulatory qualification process. A number of exploratory biomarkers and potential panels of these biomarkers was also identified for additional development. Given the different factors involved in CD and disease progression, a combination of biomarkers, including inflammatory, tissue injury, genetic, and microbiome-associated biomarkers, will likely have the most utility. CONCLUSIONS: The primary focus of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Regulatory Science Consortium will be development of exploratory biomarkers and the qualification of FC and CRP for IBD. The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Regulatory Science Consortium, focused on tools to support IBD drug development, will operate in the precompetitive space to share data, biological samples for biomarker testing, and assay information for novel biomarkers.","Porter, Amy C; Aubrecht, Jiri; Birch, Chandler; Braun, Jonathan; Cuff, Carolyn; Dasgupta, Suryasarathi; Gale, Jeremy D; Hinton, Robert; Hoffmann, Steven C; Honig, Gerard; Linggi, Bryan; Schito, Marco; Casteele, Niels Vande; Sauer, John-Michael",Inflamm. bowel dis,,772

Spatial reasoning is a difficult skill to master for geology students, although a significant component of their studies involves visualising 3D structures from 2D representations, in particular, maps. More time and experience is necessary for students to practice their spatial reasoning skills, but this is a logistical challenge. The SaD tool provides an interface that resolves these logistics of practice time and field site access. Geology is often first characterised as a field science, but recent and increasing efforts to make a more inclusive environment have shown a demand to establish a comprehensive alternative to fieldwork/trips. The SaD tool is malleable, and while providing an inclusive way to teach core components, it is also capable of an array of field experiences for almost every sub-field within the geosciences. In this pilot study, introductory geoscience students were assigned a geologic mapping lab using the SaD tool. Results overall were positive in regard to the usefulness of the tool and provide us with three main directions for next steps in research and development. © 2021 IEEE.","Bursztyn, N.; Riegel, H.; Sajjadi, P.; Masters, B.; Zhao, J.; Huang, J.; Bagher, M.

It examined whether the use of social media helped people adopt preventive actions during the pandemic. To test this hypothesis, the researchers gathered data from 512 individuals (students and academics) based in Malaysia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results suggested that risk perception had a significant effect on trust in government and self-efficacy. Moreover, these correlations were stronger when social media was used as a source for gathering information on COVID-19. In some cases, it even helped users avoid exposure to the virus. This study assessed the relationship between risk perception and the awareness gained from using social media during the pandemic and highlighted how social media usage influences trust in government and self-efficacy.","Hassan, M.

523927,The reporting of technological readiness of higher education institutions in GCC countries: A situational analysis of COVID-19 crisis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Despite relatively few COVID-19 cases within New South Wales, the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic has prevented a return to business as usual for the delivery of surgical services. This study aims to describe the evolving impact of COVID-19 on surgical activity and patient outcomes at a major public tertiary referral hospital. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study involving adult surgical patients treated at a large public tertiary referral hospital in Sydney, Australia. Surgical activity, surgical outcomes and patient demographics were compared across two time periods, including the 'first wave' (February-May 2020 vs. February-May 2019) and the 'perseverance phase' (June-September 2020 vs. June-September 2019). Variables across both groups were compared using an independent t test or chi-squared test. RESULTS: A -32% reduction in surgical separations was observed in the 'first wave', including -20% emergency and -37% elective. In the 'perseverance phase', there was a -19% reduction in surgical activity, including 0% emergency and -27% elective. The average length of stay, intensive care admissions, postoperative complications and in-hospital costs significantly increased in the 'first wave'. The proportion of public patients increased marginally (3%) in the 'first wave'. CONCLUSION: The impact of COVID-19 was most severely experienced in the initial months of the pandemic and observed in the number of patients treated. Although there was an initial effect on surgical outcomes, overall, the standard of care remained safe. The delivery of elective surgery remains a challenge and reflects the ongoing system-wide changes that are required to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.","McBride, Kate E; Steffens, Daniel; Solomon, Michael J",ANZ j.

602890,Co-circulation of multiple genotypes of human rhinovirus during a large outbreak of respiratory illness in a veterans’ long-term care home,2013-07-31,"Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is an encephalitic alphavirus that can cause debilitating, acute febrile illness and potentially result in encephalitis. Currently, there are no FDA-licensed vaccines or specific therapeutics for VEEV. Previous studies have demonstrated that VEEV infection results in increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability that is mediated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Furthermore, after subarachnoid hemorrhage in mice, MMP-9 is upregulated in the brain and mediates BBB permeability in a toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent manner. Here, we demonstrate that disease in C3H mice during VEEV TC-83 infection is dependent on TLR4 because intranasal infection of C3H/HeN (TLR4(WT)) mice with VEEV TC-83 resulted in mortality as opposed to survival of TLR4-defective C3H/HeJ (TLR4(mut)) mice. In addition, BBB permeability was induced to a lesser extent in TLR4(mut) mice compared with TLR4(WT) mice during VEEV TC-83 infection as determined by sodium fluorescein and fluorescently-conjugated dextran extravasation. Moreover, MMP-9, MMP-2, ICAM-1, CCL2 and IFN-γ were all induced to significantly lower levels in the brains of infected TLR4(mut) mice compared with infected TLR4(WT) mice despite the absence of significantly different viral titers or immune cell populations in the brains of infected TLR4(WT) and TLR4(mut) mice. These data demonstrate the critical role of TLR4 in mediating BBB permeability and disease in C3H mice during VEEV TC-83 infection, which suggests that TLR4 is a potential target for the development of therapeutics for VEEV.","Hollidge, Bradley S.; Cohen, Courtney A.; Akuoku Frimpong, Justice; Badger, Catherine V.; Dye, John M.; Schmaljohn, Connie S.",Virulence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33487119/; https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2020.1870834,772

DESIGN: Observational prospective single-centre study. SETTING: Neonatal intensive care unit at the Leiden University Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS: All local neonatal healthcare providers. INTERVENTION: There were two groups of participants: proceduralists, who wore eye-tracking glasses during procedures, and observers who later watched the procedures as part of a video-based reflection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the feasibility of, and the proceduralists and observers’ experience with, the point-of-view eye-tracking videos as an additional tool for bedside teaching and video-based reflection. RESULTS: We conducted 12 point-of-view recordings on 10 different patients (median gestational age of 30.9±3.5 weeks and weight of 1764 g) undergoing neonatal intubation (n=5), minimally invasive surfactant therapy (n=5) and umbilical line insertion (n=2). We conducted nine video-based observations with a total of 88 observers. The use of point-of-view recordings was perceived as feasible. Observers further reported the point-of-view recordings to be an educational benefit for them and a potentially instructional tool during COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We proved the practicability of eye-tracking glasses for point-of-view recordings of neonatal procedures and videos for observation, educational sessions and logistics considerations, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic distancing measures reducing bedside teaching opportunities.","Wagner, Michael; den Boer, Maria C; Jansen, Sophie; Groepel, Peter; Visser, Remco; Witlox, Ruben S G M; Bekker, Vincent; Lopriore, Enrico; Berger, Angelika; te Pas, Arjan B",Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed,https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-321806; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34413092/,772
