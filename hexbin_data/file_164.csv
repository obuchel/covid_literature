362,Early Days of Food and Environmental Virology,2010-02-04,"In July 1962, the author joined the Food Research Institute (FRI), then at the University of Chicago, to become its food virologist. There was a limited record of waterborne viral disease outbreaks at the time; recorded data on foodborne outbreaks were fewer still. Laboratory environmental (water and wastewater) virology was in its infancy, and food virology was in gestation. Detection of viruses was most often attempted by inoculation of primary primate cell cultures, with observation for plaque formation or cytopathic effects. Focus was initially on enteroviruses and reoviruses. Environmental and food samples had to be liquefied if not already in liquid form; clarified to remove solids, bacteria, and fungi; and concentrated to a volume that could be tested in cell culture. Cytotoxicity was also a concern. Studies at the FRI and some other laboratories addressed all of these challenges. The FRI group was the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Center for Food Virology for many years. Other topics studied were virus inactivation as functions of temperature, time, matrix, disinfectants, and microbial action; peroral and ex-vivo infectivity; and the suitability of various virus surrogates for environmental monitoring and inactivation experiments. Detection of noroviruses and hepatitis A virus required molecular methods, most often RT-PCR. When it was found that inactivated virus often gave the same RT-PCR signal as that of infectious virus, sample treatments were sought, which would prevent false-positive test results. Many laboratories around the world have taken up food and environmental virology since 1962, with the result that a dedicated journal has been launched.","Cliver, Dean O.",Food Environ Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2837245/,164
3453,Test Paper for Colorimetric Inspection of Fatty Acids and Edible Oils,2018-09-27,"Fatty acids (FAs) are of interest to the areas of food science and medicine because they are important dietary sources of fuel for animals and play important roles in many biological processes. The health effects of FAs are different due to the diversity of olefinic bonds in the alkyl chains including number, position and configuration. However, the discrimination of FAs is difficult from a chemical sensing perspective due to the lack of diversity in terms of functional groups. Until now, only a few chemosensors have been developed for selective sensing of FAs based on their overall shape, however they are still limited in discrimination of FAs with subtle structural differences, moreover, they cannot be used for rapid and in situ inspections. Herein, for the first time, we designed a test paper for in situ colorimetric inspection for FAs based on the combination of the highly selective binding of Ag(+) to olefinic bonds and Ag(+) mediated color variation of 3,3′,5,5′,-tetramethylbenzidine. As a result, the sensor exhibited high sensitivity and good selectivity for five FAs with subtle structural differences. Furthermore, our method described herein was successfully applied to monitor the structural variations of FAs and quality changes in mixture edible hot pot oils with heat treatment in time course. Hence, the test paper presented herein holds great potential in the inspection of fats and edible oils in food industries.","Zhang, Feng; Wang, Xiaojie; Jie, Xu; Wei, Weili",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6210129/,164
4383,What Do We Have to Lose? Offloading Through Moral Technologies: Moral Struggle and Progress,2019-03-21,"Moral bioenhancement, nudge-designed environments, and ambient persuasive technologies may help people behave more consistently with their deeply held moral convictions. Alternatively, they may aid people in overcoming cognitive and affective limitations that prevent them from appreciating a situation’s moral dimensions. Or they may simply make it easier for them to make the morally right choice by helping them to overcome sources of weakness of will. This paper makes two assumptions. First, technologies to improve people’s moral capacities are realizable. Second, such technologies will actually help people get morality right and behave more consistently with whatever the ‘real’ right thing to do turns out to be. The paper then considers whether or not humanity loses anything valuable, particularly opportunities for moral progress, when being moral is made much easier by eliminating difficult moral deliberation and internal moral struggle. Ultimately, the worry that moral struggle has value as a catalyst for moral progress is rejected. Moral progress is understood here as the discovery and application of new values or sensitization to new sources of harm.","Frank, Lily Eva",Sci Eng Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6978436/,164

5781,A code of conduct for data on epidemics,2016-06-15,"The remarkable transition of biological science into the age of molecular biology held great promise for development of new therapies for treatment of human disease. The fact that the technology exists for analyzing genetic material in exquisite detail and constructing DNA in virtually any desired form was the basis for promising rapid translation into clinical medicine and the final cure for genetically determined diseases; cystic fibrosis is the prime example of such a lung disease. The promise was not kept, at least not in a time frame which was expected. That result is neither because the rationale was faulty nor because the tools of molecular biology were wanting. The devil was and is in the details. How do you deliver DNA to the desired cell targets in amounts sufficient to accomplish the desired effect? Viral vectors have received the most attention, but viral vectors have proven to have both theoretical and practical problems. In the lungs, these vectors have not fulfilled their original promise. Non-viral based strategies work in a general sense, but efficiency of gene delivery in vivo has been a limitation. In addition, the experimental end points in both clinical and preclinical investigation have been most often designed to demonstrate phenomenology rather than potential efficacy. And, why limit the potential of gene therapy to inherited disease? In fact, treatment of acquired diseases by increasing or decreasing expression of a given gene in the lungs that would hasten recovery from an acquired disease might be easier than treating inherited disease because the requirements for duration of transgene expression would be less stringent. Over the past two decades, we have learned enough about the pathogenesis of acute lung injury to predict that increased (or decreased) production of certain biologically active mediators should be beneficial. Genes encoding some of these mediators have been cloned and constructs made which express the genes. It is now possible using either viral or non-viral strategies to deliver expression constructs to the lungs and, since acute lung injury has a dismal prognosis and no effective drugs have been identified, this seems a good clinical target for gene therapy. In preclinical studies, we have shown that increased expression of the gene encoding the constitutive form of the cyclooxygenase gene (COX-1) results in increased production of prostacyclin and PGE(2) by the lungs and inhibits endotoxin induced pulmonary hypertension and edema. Additional studies demonstrate that increased expression of the alpha-1 antitrypsin gene in human respiratory epithelium in culture and in vivo has anti-viral and anti-inflammatory effects that are not predicted by extracellular concentrations of the transgene product. Thus, acute lung injury is a reasonable target for gene therapy, and evidence to date indicates that current technology is sufficiently robust to pursue this novel area for treatment of this devastating disease.","Brigham, K.

Acute lung injury results in disruption of the alveolar epithelial barrier and leads to impaired clearance of edema fluid and altered Na,K-ATPase function. There has been significant progress in the understanding of mechanisms regulating alveolar edema clearance and signaling pathways modulating Na,K-ATPase function during lung injury. The accompanying review by Morty et al. focuses on intact organ and animal models as well as clinical studies assessing alveolar fluid reabsorption in alveolar epithelial injury. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying regulation of active Na(+) transport, as well as the pathways by which the Na,K-ATPase regulates epithelial barrier function and edema clearance, are of significance to identify interventional targets to improve outcomes of patients with acute lung injury.","Vadász, István; Raviv, Stacy; Sznajder, Jacob I.",Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095466/,164

7583,Correlations between structure and random walk dynamics in directed complex networks,2007-07-30,"OBJECTIVE: Data on best practices for evacuating an intensive care unit (ICU) during a disaster are limited. The impact of Hurricane Sandy on New York City area hospitals provided a unique opportunity to learn from the experience of ICU providers about their preparedness, perspective, roles, and activities. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of nurses, respiratory therapists, and physicians who played direct roles during the Hurricane Sandy ICU evacuations. RESULTS: Sixty-eight health care professionals from 4 evacuating hospitals completed surveys (35% ICU nurses, 21% respiratory therapists, 25% physicians-in-training, and 13% attending physicians). Only 21% had participated in an ICU evacuation drill in the past 2 years and 28% had prior training or real-life experience. Processes were inconsistent for patient prioritization, tracking, transport medications, and transport care. Respondents identified communication (43%) as the key barrier to effective evacuation. The equipment considered most helpful included flashlights (24%), transport sleds (21%), and oxygen tanks and respiratory therapy supplies (19%). An evacuation wish list included walkie-talkies/phones (26%), lighting/electricity (18%), flashlights (10%), and portable ventilators and suction (16%). CONCLUSIONS: ICU providers who evacuated critically ill patients during Hurricane Sandy had little prior knowledge of evacuation processes or vertical evacuation experience. The weakest links in the patient evacuation process were communication and the availability of practical tools. Incorporating ICU providers into hospital evacuation planning and training, developing standard evacuation communication processes and tools, and collecting a uniform dataset among all evacuating hospitals could better inform critical care evacuation in the future.

9809,News from academia: Biotechnoloy Journal 3/2007,2007-03-12,"Multilocus electrophoretic methods and microcomplement fixation comparisons of serum albumin are used to assess phylogenetic relationships among species of uropeltid snakes, to infer aspects of their population biology and biogeography, and to evaluate their relationships to other primitive snakes (Henophidia). There is very good agreement between phylogenetic inferences derived from the electrophoretic data and those derived from the albumin immunological data. Protein variation detected by electrophoresis is relatively high among 17 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) examined. The mean number of alleles per locus (5.1 across all OTUs), levels of polymorphism (25% of loci), and heterozygosity (4–6%), are typical of, or greater than, values reported for other snakes. Species of uropeltids are genetically highly differentiated, as measured by genetic distances (lowest interspecific Nei's unbiased genetic distances, 0.22‐0.27 among several Sri Lankan species; 2.3 between Teretrurus of India and other uropeltines). The phylogenetic tree most consistent with both the immunological and electrophoretic data shows uropeltines from Sri Lanka to be monophyletic, but the Indian species are paraphyletic with respect to those from Sri Lanka. Rhinophis travancoricus of India is inferred to be the sister taxon to the Sri Lankan radiation. As the genera are presently understood, neither Rhinophis nor Uropeltis appears to be monophyletic. A biogeographic scenario derived from the phylogenetic hypothesis suggests an early diversification of uropeltids in India, followed by a single invasion into the lowlands of Sri Lanka. Subsequent evolution on Sri Lanka resulted in occupation of montane biotopes. Cylindrophis is the sister group to uropeltines and is considered a member of the Uropeltidae. The immunological data indicate no phylogenetic association between uropeltids and other ‘anilioid’ taxa, specifically Anilius, Loxocemus or Xenopeltis, although we cannot rule out a very remote relationship. We specifically reject the hypothesis that uropeltines and scolecophidians form a clade relative to henophidians. High levels of genetic variation and a trend toward negative F(IS) values for polymorphic loci in three populations suggest generally large effective population sizes and outbreeding in these species. The niche‐width variation hypothesis for allozyme loci is not supported by the uropeltid data. In comparison to other vertebrates, the relationship between Nei's genetic distance and albumin immunological distance in uropeltids suggests either conservative albumin evolution or strong differentiation at electrophoretic loci.","CADLE, JOHN E.; DESSAUER, HERBERT C.; GANS, CARL; GARTSIDE, DONALD F.",Biol J Linn Soc Lond,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161806/,164

10179,Fragebogen zur PharmuZ “Arzneimittel gegen Tropenkrankheiten II”,2009-12-23,"This review presents a comprehensive survey on intensive studies performed during the last decades on point defect reactions on α‐iron (α‐Fe) and its diluted alloys. Our intention is to give an actual account of the knowledge accumulated on this subject, as it has been obtained predominantly by means of the magnetic after‐effect (MAE) spectroscopy. After a concise introduction into the theoretical and experimental fundamentals of this technique, the main concern is focused on the presentation and detailed discussion of the MAE spectra arising — after low‐temperature electron (e(–))‐ or neutron(n)‐irradiation and subsequent annealing — in: (i) high‐purity α‐Fe and α‐Fe doped with (ii) substitutional solutes (like Ni, V, Al, Cu, Ti, Be, Si, Mn, …) or (iii) interstitial solutes (like O, H, C, N). During the course of systematic annealing treatments, these respective spectra undergo dramatic variations at specific temperatures thereby revealing in great detail the underlying intrinsic reactions of the radiation‐induced defects, i.e., reorientation, migration, clustering, dissolution and finally annihilation. In alloyed Fe systems the corresponding reaction sequences are even multiplied due to additional interactions between defects and solute atoms. Most valuable information concerning formation‐, dissociation‐ and binding enthalpies of small, mixed clusters (of the type C(i)V(k), N(i)V(k); i, k ≥ 1) has been obtained in high‐purity α‐Fe base material which, after charging with C or N, had been e(–)‐irradiated. Concerning the basic recovery mechanisms in α‐Fe, two complementary results are obtained from the analysis of the various systems: (i) in high‐purity and substitutionally alloyed α‐Fe the recovery in Stage‐III (200 K) is governed by a three‐dimensionally migrating (H (M) (I) = 0.56 eV) stable interstitial (dumb‐bell); (ii) following the formation and dissociation kinetics of small clusters (C(1)V(k), N(1)V(k)) in interstitially alloyed α‐Fe the migration enthalpy of the monovacancy must hold the following relation H (M) (N) (0.76 eV) < H (M) (C) (0.84 eV) < H (M) (V1). These results are in clear agreement with the so‐called two‐interstitial model (2IM) in α‐Fe – a conclusion being further substantiated by a systematic comparison with the results obtained from nonrelaxational techniques, like i.e. positron annihilation (PA), which by their authors are preferentially interpreted in terms of the one‐interstitial model (1IM).","Blythe, H.J.; Kronmüller, H.; Seeger, A.; Walz, F.",Physica Status Solidi A Appl Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167824/,164
10882,Collective versus hub activation of epidemic phases on networks,2016-03-14,"Many complex systems are characterized by time-varying patterns of interactions. These interactions comprise strong ties, driven by dyadic relationships, and weak ties, based on node-specific attributes. The interplay between strong and weak ties plays an important role on dynamical processes that could unfold on complex systems. However, seldom do we have access to precise information about the time-varying topology of interaction patterns. A particularly elusive question is to distinguish strong from weak ties, on the basis of the sole node dynamics. Building upon analytical results, we propose a statistically-principled algorithm to reconstruct the backbone of strong ties from data of a spreading process, consisting of the time series of individuals' states. Our method is numerically validated over a range of synthetic datasets, encapsulating salient features of real-world systems. Motivated by compelling evidence, we propose the integration of our algorithm in a targeted immunization strategy that prioritizes influential nodes in the inferred backbone. Through Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic networks and a real-world case study, we demonstrate the viability of our approach.","Surano, Francesco Vincenzo; Bongiorno, Christian; Zino, Lorenzo; Porfiri, Maurizio; Rizzo, Alessandro",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217498/,164

However, we discover from real data that on a large scale, the spread of an epidemic is in fact a recurrent event with distinctive growing and recovering phases, i.e., a hysteresis loop. We show here that the hysteresis loop can be reproduced in epidemic models provided that the infectious rate is adiabatically increased or decreased before the system reaches its stationary state. Two ways to the hysteresis loop are revealed, which is helpful in understanding the mechanics of infections in real evolution. Moreover, a theoretical analysis is presented to explain the mechanism of the hysteresis loop.","Liu, Hengcong; Zheng, Muhua; Wu, Dayu; Wang, Zhenhua; Liu, Jinming; Liu, Zonghua",Phys Rev E,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217505/,164
10890,Outbreaks in susceptible-infected-removed epidemics with multiple seeds,2016-03-30,"The understanding and prediction of information diffusion processes on networks is a major challenge in network theory with many implications in social sciences. Many theoretical advances occurred due to stochastic spreading models. Nevertheless, these stochastic models overlooked the influence of rational decisions on the outcome of the process. For instance, different levels of trust in acquaintances do play a role in information spreading, and actors may change their spreading decisions during the information diffusion process accordingly. Here, we study an information-spreading model in which the decision to transmit or not is based on trust. We explore the interplay between the propagation of information and the trust dynamics happening on a two-layer multiplex network. Actors' trustable or untrustable states are defined as accumulated cooperation or defection behaviors, respectively, in a Prisoner's Dilemma setup, and they are controlled by a memory span. The propagation of information is abstracted as a threshold model on the information-spreading layer, where the threshold depends on the trustability of agents. The analysis of the model is performed using a tree approximation and validated on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. The results show that the memory of previous actions has a significant effect on the spreading of information. For example, the less memory that is considered, the higher is the diffusion. Information is highly promoted by the emergence of trustable acquaintances. These results provide insight into the effect of plausible biases on spreading dynamics in a multilevel networked system.","Wu, Hongrun; Arenas, Alex; Gómez, Sergio",Phys Rev E,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217509/,164
10892,Epidemic spreading in random rectangular networks,2016-11-28,"A major hurdle in the simulation of the steady state of epidemic processes is that the system will unavoidably visit an absorbing, disease-free state at sufficiently long times due to the finite size of the networks where epidemics evolves. In the present work, we compare different quasistationary (QS) simulation methods where the absorbing states are suitably handled and the thermodynamical limit of the original dynamics can be achieved. We analyze the standard QS (SQS) method, where the sampling is constrained to active configurations, the reflecting boundary condition (RBC), where the dynamics returns to the pre-absorbing configuration, and hub reactivation (HR), where the most connected vertex of the network is reactivated after a visit to an absorbing state. We apply the methods to the contact process (CP) and susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) models on regular and scale free networks. The investigated methods yield the same epidemic threshold for both models. For CP, that undergoes a standard collective phase transition, the methods are equivalent. For SIS, whose phase transition is ruled by the hub mutual reactivation, the SQS and HR methods are able to capture localized epidemic phases while RBC is not. We also apply the autocorrelation time as a tool to characterize the phase transition and observe that this analysis provides the same finite-size scaling exponents for the critical relaxation time for the investigated methods. Finally, we verify the equivalence between RBC method and a weak external field for epidemics on networks.","Sander, Renan S.; Costa, Guilherme S.; Ferreira, Silvio C.",Phys Rev E,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217511/,164
10893,Influence of trust in the spreading of information,2017-01-03,"Variability on external conditions has important consequences for the dynamics and the organization of biological systems. In many cases, the characteristic timescale of environmental changes as well as their correlations play a fundamental role in the way living systems adapt and respond to it. A proper mathematical approach to understand population dynamics, thus, requires approaches more refined than, e.g., simple white-noise approximations. To shed further light onto this problem, in this paper we propose a unifying framework based on different analytical and numerical tools available to deal with “colored” environmental noise. In particular, we employ a “unified colored noise approximation” to map the original problem into an effective one with white noise, and then we apply a standard path integral approach to gain analytical understanding. For the sake of specificity, we present our approach using as a guideline a variation of the contact process—which can also be seen as a birth-death process of the Malthus-Verhulst class—where the propagation or birth rate varies stochastically in time. Our approach allows us to tackle in a systematic manner some of the relevant questions concerning population dynamics under environmental variability, such as determining the stationary population density, establishing the conditions under which a population may become extinct, and estimating extinction times. We focus on the emerging phase diagram and its possible phase transitions, underlying how these are affected by the presence of environmental noise time-correlations.","Spanio, Tommaso; Hidalgo, Jorge; Muñoz, Miguel A.",Phys Rev E,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217512/,164
10896,Impact of environmental colored noise in single-species population dynamics,2017-10-02,"This study focuses on investigating the manner in which a prompt quarantine measure suppresses epidemics in networks. A simple and ideal quarantine measure is considered in which an individual is detected with a probability immediately after it becomes infected and the detected one and its neighbors are promptly isolated. The efficiency of this quarantine in suppressing a susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model is tested in random graphs and uncorrelated scale-free networks. Monte Carlo simulations are used to show that the prompt quarantine measure outperforms random and acquaintance preventive vaccination schemes in terms of reducing the number of infected individuals. The epidemic threshold for the SIR model is analytically derived under the quarantine measure, and the theoretical findings indicate that prompt executions of quarantines are highly effective in containing epidemics. Even if infected individuals are detected with a very low probability, the SIR model under a prompt quarantine measure has finite epidemic thresholds in fat-tailed scale-free networks in which an infected individual can always cause an outbreak of a finite relative size without any measure. The numerical simulations also demonstrate that the present quarantine measure is effective in suppressing epidemics in real networks.","Hasegawa, Takehisa; Nemoto, Koji",Phys Rev E,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217515/,164

Adjusting interacting partners is an effective individualized control strategy. Intuitively, it is done either by shortening the interaction time between susceptible and infected individuals or by increasing the opportunities for contact between susceptible individuals. Here, we provide a comparative study on these two control strategies by establishing an epidemic model with nonuniform stochastic interactions. It seems that the two strategies should be similar, since shortening the interaction time between susceptible and infected individuals somehow increases the chances for contact between susceptible individuals. However, analytical results indicate that the effectiveness of the former strategy sensitively depends on the infectious intensity and the combinations of different interaction rates, whereas the latter one is quite robust and efficient. Simulations are shown to verify our analytical predictions. Our work may shed light on the strategic choice of disease control.","Wu, Bin; Mao, Shanjun; Wang, Jiazeng; Zhou, Da",Phys Rev E,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217516/,164

How many time steps [Formula: see text] does it take to completely infect a network of [Formula: see text] nodes, starting from a single infected node? An analogy to the classic “coupon collector” problem of probability theory reveals that the takeover time [Formula: see text] is dominated by extremal behavior, either when there are only a few infected nodes near the start of the process or a few susceptible nodes near the end. We show that for [Formula: see text] , the takeover time [Formula: see text] is distributed as a Gumbel distribution for the star graph, as the convolution of two Gumbel distributions for a complete graph and an Erdős-Rényi random graph, as a normal for a one-dimensional ring and a two-dimensional lattice, and as a family of intermediate skewed distributions for [Formula: see text]-dimensional lattices with [Formula: see text] (these distributions approach the convolution of two Gumbel distributions as [Formula: see text] approaches infinity).

10903,Griffiths phase on hierarchical modular networks with small-world edges,2017-03-06,"Two important problems regarding spreading phenomena in complex topologies are the optimal selection of node sets either to minimize or maximize the extent of outbreaks. Both problems are nontrivial when a small fraction of the nodes in the network can be used to achieve the desired goal. The minimization problem is equivalent to a structural optimization. The “superblockers,” i.e., the nodes that should be removed from the network to minimize the size of outbreaks, are those nodes that make connected components as small as possible. “Superspreaders” are instead the nodes such that, if chosen as initiators, they maximize the average size of outbreaks. The identity of superspreaders is expected to depend not just on the topology, but also on the specific dynamics considered. Recently, it has been conjectured that the two optimization problems might be equivalent, in the sense that superblockers act also as superspreaders. In spite of its potential groundbreaking importance, no empirical study has been performed to validate this conjecture. In this paper, we perform an extensive analysis over a large set of real-world networks to test the similarity between sets of superblockers and of superspreaders. We show that the two optimization problems are not equivalent: superblockers do not act as optimal spreaders.","Radicchi, Filippo; Castellano, Claudio",Phys Rev E,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217522/,164

When the contagion spreads from a single seed, a cluster of infected and recovered nodes grows without any cluster merging process. However, when the contagion starts from multiple seeds of [Formula: see text] where [Formula: see text] is the system size, a node weakened by a seed can be infected more easily when it is in contact with another node infected by a different pathogen seed. This contagion process can be viewed as a cluster merging process in a percolation model. Here we show analytically and numerically that when the density of infectious seeds is relatively small but [Formula: see text] , the epidemic transition is hybrid, exhibiting both continuous and discontinuous behavior, whereas when it is sufficiently large and reaches a critical point, the transition becomes continuous. We determine the full set of critical exponents describing the hybrid and the continuous transitions.

One feature that can change spreading dynamics substantially is heterogeneous behavior among different types of individuals in a social network. In this paper, we explore how antiestablishment nodes (e.g., hipsters) influence the spreading dynamics of two competing products. We consider a model in which spreading follows a deterministic rule for updating node states (which indicate which product has been adopted) in which an adjustable probability [Formula: see text] of the nodes in a network are hipsters, who choose to adopt the product that they believe is the less popular of the two. The remaining nodes are conformists, who choose which product to adopt by considering which products their immediate neighbors have adopted. We simulate our model on both synthetic and real networks, and we show that the hipsters have a major effect on the final fraction of people who adopt each product: even when only one of the two products exists at the beginning of the simulations, a small fraction of hipsters in a network can still cause the other product to eventually become the more popular one. To account for this behavior, we construct an approximation for the steady-state adoption fractions of the products on [Formula: see text]-regular trees in the limit of few hipsters. Additionally, our simulations demonstrate that a time delay [Formula: see text] in the knowledge of the product distribution in a population, as compared to immediate knowledge of product adoption among nearest neighbors, can have a large effect on the final distribution of product adoptions. Using a local-tree approximation, we derive an analytical estimate of the spreading of products and obtain good agreement if a sufficiently small fraction of the population consists of hipsters. In all networks, we find that either of the two products can become the more popular one at steady state, depending on the fraction of hipsters in the network and on the amount of delay in the knowledge of the product distribution. Our simple model and analysis may help shed light on the road to success for antiestablishment choices in elections, as such success—and qualitative differences in final outcomes between competing products, political candidates, and so on—can arise rather generically in our model from a small number of antiestablishment individuals and ordinary processes of social influence on normal individuals.","Juul, Jonas S.; Porter, Mason A.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217548/,164
10925,Effective distances for epidemics spreading on complex networks,2017-01-17,"For a reliable prediction of an epidemic or information spreading pattern in complex systems, well-defined measures are essential. In the susceptible-infected model on heterogeneous networks, the cluster of infected nodes in the intermediate-time regime exhibits too large fluctuation in size to use its mean size as a representative value. The cluster size follows quite a broad distribution, which is shown to be derived from the variation of the cluster size with the time when a hub node was first infected. On the contrary, the distribution of the time taken to infect a given number of nodes is well concentrated at its mean, suggesting the mean infection time is a better measure. We show that the mean infection time can be evaluated by using the scaling behaviors of the boundary area of the infected cluster and use it to find a nonexponential but algebraic spreading phase in the intermediate stage on strongly heterogeneous networks. Such slow spreading originates in only small-degree nodes left susceptible, while most hub nodes are already infected in the early exponential-spreading stage. Our results offer a way to detour around large statistical fluctuations and quantify reliably the temporal pattern of spread under structural heterogeneity.","Lee, Mi Jin; Lee, Deok-Sun",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217551/,164

CTDSP1’s major activity has been identified as dephosphorylation of the 5th Ser residue of the tandem heptad repeat of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (RNAP II CTD). It is also implicated in various pivotal biological activities, such as acting as a driving factor in repressor element 1 (RE-1)-silencing transcription factor (REST) complex, which silences the neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells, G1/S phase transition, and osteoblast differentiation. Recent findings have denoted that negative regulation of CTDSP1 results in suppression of cancer invasion in neuroglioma cells. Several researchers have focused on the development of regulating materials of CTDSP1, due to the significant roles it has in various biological activities.

This study aimed to assess the confidence of veterinarians in the UK in treating and diagnosing rabbits, guinea pigs, small mammals and reptiles. METHODS: A 41-question survey was promoted via social media, including on interest groups focused specifically at veterinary professionals. A total of 131 practising veterinarians in the UK completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: Frequency of presentation of exotic pets to a practice had a significant effect (P<0.01) on the confidence of veterinarians in treating them. Veterinarians who were presented with exotics more frequently had increased self-reported knowledge of their health and disease and were more confident in treating, diagnosing and anaesthetising them. Knowledge of and confidence in diagnosing and treating exotic pets were significantly less than for dogs and cats (P<0.001). There was a significant effect of length of time qualified on confidence in treating exotic pet species (P<0.01).

Poor mental health in AGYW is associated with increased sexual risk behaviours, and impeded HIV testing and care. Using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions, we explored subjective experiences of mental health and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) amongst 237 AGYW aged 15–24 years in five South African districts. Respondents shared narratives of stress, emotional isolation, feelings of depression, and suicidal ideation, interconnected with HIV, pregnancy and violence in relationships. Findings show that AGYW in South Africa face a range of mental health stressors and lack sufficient support, which intersect with SRH challenges to heighten their vulnerability. Framed within the syndemic theory, our findings suggest that South African AGYW’s vulnerability towards early pregnancy, HIV infection and poor mental health are bidirectional and interconnected. Considering the overlaps and interactions between mental health and SRH amongst AGYW, it is critical that mental health components are integrated into SRH interventions.","Duby, Zoe; McClinton Appollis, Tracy; Jonas, Kim; Maruping, Kealeboga; Dietrich, Janan; LoVette, Ashleigh; Kuo, Caroline; Vanleeuw, Lieve; Mathews, Catherine",AIDS Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7368608/,164

14116,"The birth of a bacterial tRNA gene by large-scale, tandem duplication events",2020-10-30,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With improvements in cardiovascular care, and routine percutaneous coronary intervention for ST elevation myocardial infarction, more patients are surviving following acute coronary syndromes. However, a minority of patients develop cardiogenic shock which results in approximately 50% 30-day mortality. There are various ways to classify cardiogenic shock, and much has been written about this topic in recent years. This review will examine recent developments and put them in context. RECENT FINDINGS: The large randomized trials of cardiogenic shock treatments such as the IABP-SHOCK II trial used a clinical definition of shock including hypotension (systolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or less, or requirement of vasopressors to maintain such a blood pressure), as well as hypoperfusion. However, while this defines a minimum standard to define cardiogenic shock, it does not distinguish between a patient on a single vasoconstrictor and one who is on multiple high dose infusions or one on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The Society for Cardiac Angiography and Intervention recently published an expert consensus statement defining stages of cardiogenic shock, from at risk to beginning, classic, deteriorating, and extremis cardiogenic shock stages. The simple framework has been validated rapidly in multiple populations including the intensive care unit, a post-myocardial infarction population, an out of hospital cardiac arrest population, and most recently in a multicenter shock collaborative, SUMMARY: Classification is fundamental to understanding a disease state, and crafting solutions to improve outcomes. The last 20 years has witnessed an explosion of percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices of increasing sophistication and capability, and yet there has been little progress in improving outcomes of cardiogenic shock. Hopefully, the next 20 years will see massive advances in understanding of the complexities of the various stages of cardiogenic shock. With such knowledge, it is likely that targeted treatments will be developed and the mortality of this disease will finally plummet.","Baran, David A.; Long, Ashleigh; Jentzer, Jacob C.",Curr Heart Fail Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7665964/,164

The evaluation of their framework/content quality is unclear. The aim of this study was to describe which tools and domains are able to critically evaluate the quality of clinical/care pathways. An overview of systematic reviews was conducted, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, using Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, PsychInfo, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library, from 2015 to 2020, and with snowballing methods. The quality of the reviews was assessed with Assessment the Methodology of Systematic Review (AMSTAR-2) and categorized with The Leuven Clinical Pathway Compass for the definition of the five domains: processes, service, clinical, team, and financial. We found nine reviews. Three achieved a high level of quality with AMSTAR-2. The areas classified according to The Leuven Clinical Pathway Compass were: 9.7% team multidisciplinary involvement, 13.2% clinical (morbidity/mortality), 44.3% process (continuity-clinical integration, transitional), 5.6% financial (length of stay), and 27.0% service (patient-/family-centered care). Overall, none of the 300 instruments retrieved could be considered a gold standard mainly because they did not cover all the critical pathway domains outlined by Leuven and Health Technology Assessment. This overview shows important insights for the definition of a multiprinciple framework of core domains for assessing the quality of pathways. The core domains should consider general critical aspects common to all pathways, but it is necessary to define specific domains for specific diseases, fast pathways, and adapting the tool to the cultural and organizational characteristics of the health system of each country.","Latina, Roberto; Salomone, Katia; D’Angelo, Daniela; Coclite, Daniela; Castellini, Greta; Gianola, Silvia; Fauci, Alice; Napoletano, Antonello; Iacorossi, Laura; Iannone, Primiano",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7699889/,164
14313,Curvature-processing domains in primate V4,2020-11-19,"PURPOSE: In neuromuscular disorders (NMD), inspiratory muscle weakness may cause sleep-related hypoventilation requiring non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Alternatively, nasal high flow therapy (NHF) may ameliorate mild nocturnal hypercapnia (NH) through washout of anatomical dead space and generation of positive airway pressure. Ventilatory support by NIV or NHF might have favourable short-term effects on sympathovagal balance (SVB). This study comparatively investigated the effects of NHF and NIV on sleep-related breathing and SVB in NMD patients with evolving NH. METHODS: Transcutaneous CO(2) (p(tc)CO(2)), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), sleep outcomes and SVB (spectral analysis of heart rate, diastolic blood pressure variability) along with haemodynamic measures (cardiac index, total peripheral resistance index) were evaluated overnight in 17 patients. Polysomnographies (PSG) were randomly split into equal parts with no treatment, NIV and NHF at different flow rates (20 l/min vs. 50 l/min). In-depth analysis of SVB and haemodynamics was performed on 10-min segments of stable N2 sleep taken from each intervention. RESULTS: Compared with no treatment, NHF20 and NHF50 did not significantly change p(tc)CO(2), SpO(2) or the apnea hypopnea index (AHI). NHF50 was poorly tolerated. In contrast, NIV significantly improved both gas exchange and AHI without adversely affecting sleep. During daytime, NHF20 and NHF50 had neutral effects on ventilation and oxygenation whereas NIV improved p(tc)CO(2) and SpO(2). Effects of NIV and NHF on SVB and haemodynamics were neutral during both night and daytime. CONCLUSIONS: NHF does not correct sleep-disordered breathing in NMD patients with NH. Both NHF and NIV exert no immediate effects on SVB.","Meyer, Anna Christina; Spiesshoefer, Jens; Siebers, Nina Christina; Heidbreder, Anna; Thiedemann, Christian; Schneider, Hartmut; Braun, Andrew T.; Randerath, Winfried; Young, Peter; Dreher, Michael; Boentert, Matthias",Sleep Breath,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7708892/,164

What regulates the fate of these cells and to what extent they can assume the identity and function of resident macrophages is unclear. Here, we show that macrophages elicited into the peritoneal cavity during mild inflammation persist long-term but are retained in an immature transitory state of differentiation due to the presence of enduring resident macrophages. By contrast, severe inflammation results in ablation of resident macrophages and a protracted phase wherein the cavity is incapable of sustaining a resident phenotype, yet ultimately elicited cells acquire a mature resident identity. These macrophages also have transcriptionally and functionally divergent features that result from inflammation-driven alterations to the peritoneal cavity micro-environment and, to a lesser extent, effects of origin and time-of-residency. Hence, rather than being predetermined, the fate of inflammation-elicited peritoneal macrophages seems to be regulated by the environment.","Louwe, P.

The objective of our study is to determine the individual or combined accuracy of coagulation and inflammation biomarkers with standard biochemical tests to diagnose adult septic patients presenting to the emergency department. METHODS: in the Emergency Department is a prospective, observational cohort study with a target enrolment of 250 suspected septic patients from two Canadian emergency departments. The emergency physicians will enroll patients with suspected sepsis. Blood samples will be collected at two time points (initial presentation and 4 hr following). Patients will be adjudicated into septic, infected, or not infected status in accordance with the Sepsis-3 definitions. Patient demographics, cultures, diagnosis, and biomarkers will be reported using descriptive statistics. Optimal cut off values with sensitivity and specificity for each biomarker will be determined using C-statistics to distinguish between septic and nonseptic patients. Stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis with exclusion of nonsignificant covariates from the final model will be used to establish a panel of biomarkers.

We first optimised the sample preparation for twelve samples simultaneously, saving time on imaging. In this work, SEM proved its ability to identify bacteria and yeasts in morphotypes up to the genus level in some cases. We blindly tested 1075 blood cultures and compared our results to the Gram staining preliminary identification, with MALDI-TOF/MS as a reference. This method presents major advantages such as a fast microbe identification, within an hour of the blood culture being detected positive, low preparation costs, and data traceability. This SEM identification strategy can be developed into an automated assay from the sample preparation, micrograph acquisition, and identification process.

METHODS: Between May and September 2019, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among adults (n = 1,813) from three ethnic minority communities (A Chang, De Ang and Jing Po) in Yunnan Province, Southwest China. Dietary intakes during the past 12 months were measured with a 100-item Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), and two forms of social capital (bonding and bridging) were measured using the validated Personal Social Capital Scale 16 (PSCS-16). Principal component factor analysis was used to derive dietary patterns from 20 food groups. Multivariate linear regressions were used to examine the associations between social capital and dietary patterns. RESULTS: Two distinct dietary patterns were identified: the traditional and the modern. The traditional pattern was characterized by high consumptions of tubers, poultry, rice, fruits, vegetables and low consumptions of oil and salt, whereas the modern pattern was highly correlated with egg, nut, beverage, snack and oil consumptions. After adjusted for potential confounders, the modern pattern was positively associated with bonding capital (β = 0.066; 95%CI: 0.058, 0.075) and negatively associated with bridging capital (β = -0.017; 95%CI: -0.024, -0.010).

The aim of this study was the investigation of potential groups of inpatient cases of a university hospital for trauma surgery and orthopedics, which might be at risk for transfer to surgical outpatient treatment. METHODS: Data collection using SAP Data Warehouse included all inpatient cases 2017–2019, with subgroup analysis of economic parameters of three risk groups (RG): 1) primary misallocation, 2) procedures of AOP categories 1 and/or 2 and 3) elective 1‑day cases. Furthermore, an analysis of epidemiological parameters and an economic evaluation were performed. RESULTS: Primary misallocations related to 245 cases, RG 2 had 764 cases and RG 3 had 891 cases. The average age was 45.5 ± 17.7 years and in 90% there were no relevant comorbidities (PCCL 0). The majority of cases were assigned to DRG I23B and I21Z (removal of osteosynthesis material, 15–23%), followed by open or arthroscopic surgery of the extremities (DRG I32F, I32G, I24Z, I18B, 6–9%).

After agreeing on a final prioritized disease list, participants used components of the One Health Systems Mapping and Analysis Resource Toolkit, developed by USDA and University of Minnesota, to review multidisciplinary coordination processes for the prioritized zoonotic diseases. RESULTS: Participants selected epidemic or pandemic potential, disease severity, economic impact, introduction or increased transmission potential, and national security as criteria to prioritize 56 zoonoses. The eight prioritized zoonotic diseases for the US were zoonotic influenzas, salmonellosis, West Nile virus, plague, emerging coronaviruses (e.g., SARS, MERS), rabies, brucellosis, and Lyme disease. Agencies then discussed recommendations to enhance One Health approaches to surveillance, response, prevention, and control of the prioritized zoonoses. Key themes and next steps for further implementation of One Health approaches were identified. CONCLUSION: This OHZDP workshop represents the first use of a One Health approach to zoonotic disease prioritization in the United States. It is a critical step forward in US government agency collaboration using One Health approaches. Further, the workshop created a foundation for future US government One Health systems strengthening for the prioritized zoonoses.

22706,Trends and Perspectives of Biosensors for Food and Environmental Virology,2010-05-19,"Coronavirus-like particles (CVLP) are associated with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (sx) in mammals, including man. We report an intensive care nursery (NICU) outbreak of GI sx associated with CVLP, identified by electron microscopy, in the stools of affected infants. Immune aggregation of stool CVLP occurred with sera of CVLP positive (+) infants only. Prevalence of stool CVLP, ascertained by 8 NICU-wide surveys over 40 weeks, fell from 67% to less than 10%, paralleling prevalence changes in the community. Most infants surveyed were premature. Overall, 36% (32/88) of all infants were CVLP +. Prenatal or intrapartum acquisition was suggested by the finding that 34% (11/32) of the CVLP + infants were examined within 72 hours of birth. CVLP + infants were more likely to have GI sx within 7 da of survey (p<.005), including water loss stools (p<.005), and the following sx persisting for more than 2 days: gastric retention (p<.001), bilious gastric aspirates (p<.02), abdominal distention (p<.01) and gross or occult blood in the stool (p<.005). CVLP + infants were also more likely to have multiple sx and to have feeds discontinued for more than 3 days due to GI sx. We conclude that stool Coronavirus-like particles are associated with clinically significant GI disease in the newborn.","Vaucher, Yvonne E; Ray, C George; Minnich, Linda L; Payne, Claire M; Beck, Donna J; Lowe, Paula F",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086796/,164
22707,Minimum Infective Dose of the Major Human Respiratory and Enteric Viruses Transmitted Through Food and the Environment,2011-03-16,"Fewer physicians have experience in diagnosis of measles as the number of cases continues to decline. For this reason an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was developed to detect measles virus specific IgM antibody (MIgMA). Anti-human μ chain is affixed to a solid phase to which a 1:100 dilution of serum is added. Only 0.005 ml of patient's serum is needed. Treatment of 3 MIgMA positive sera with dithiothreitol but not Staph protein A removed MIgMA. The values for 24 cord sera (0.030 ± 0.007), 60 adult sera (0.034 ± 0.011), and 47 sera from children prior to measles immunization (0.030 ± 0.015) were used to establish a seronegative range. Sera yielding reactions greater than 3 SD of the mean for the latter group were considered to be positive for the presence of MIgMA. MIgMA was not detected in sera with high titers of rheumatoid factor. Five unpaired and the first of 14 of 17 paired sera obtained from patients with measles were positive for MIgMA. The 3 convalescent samples from patients having MIgMA negative initial sera, also were positive. MIgMA was detected as early as 1 day and as late as 41 days following onset of illness. No MIgMA could be detected in 47 vaccinees tested 2-1/2 months or more after measles vaccination. Neither recent immunization nor the presence of rheumatoid factor produce reactions which are likely to obfuscate the interpretation of this very sensitive test which, in most cases, can confirm the clinical diagnosis of measles on a single serum specimen obtained soon after onset of rash.","Lievens, Alan W; Brunell, Philip A; Cobb, Elaine K",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086804/,164
22828,News in brief,2003,"In this paper, we formulated a mathematical model that studies the dynamics of HIV/AIDS in Turkey from 1985 to 2016. We find two equilibrium points, disease free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium. Global stability analysis of the equilibria was conducted using Lyapunov function which depends on the basic reproduction ratio R (0). If R (0) < 1, the disease free equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable, and if R (0) ≥ 1 the endemic equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable. We computed and predicted the basic reproduction ratios across all the years. It was found out that there were flaws in the exact values of R (0) which is related to the poor registration system of HIV/AIDS in Turkey. Hence, there is need for the government to improve the system in order to cover the actual cases of the disease. The increase of the basic reproduction ratio over the years also shows the need for the relevant authorities to adopt appropriate control measures in combating the disease.","Sayan, Murat; Hınçal, Evren; Şanlıdağ, Tamer; Kaymakamzade, Bilgen; Sa’ad, Farouk Tijjani; Baba, Isa Abdullahi",Qual Quant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088870/,164

23440,Electrophoresis in Microfluidic Systems,2007,"BACKGROUND: Management of CMV infection in solid organ transplantation (SOT) and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients mainly relies on screening of emerging CMV DNA in plasma or whole blood by PCR. However, a first positive CMV PCR may not be reproducible, but constitute a CMV blip (single positive CMV PCR measurements). Such blips are known from monitoring of other viral infections using PCR technology, and may either constitute a false positive read due to assay variability or reflect transient low-level viral replication. We investigated the impact of CMV blips in a cohort of SOT and HSCT recipients. METHODS: SOT and HSCT recipients transplanted between 2010 and 2015, who had a known donor (D)/recipient (R) CMV IgG serostatus (D+/R+, D+/R- or D-/R+), and with ≥3 CMV PCRs fulfilling the CMV PCR triplicate criteria (Figure 1) were included (N = 851). Odds ratio (OR) for factors associated with a triplicate being a blip was estimated by binomial regression adjusted for repeated measurements. Whether blips affected the hazard ratio (HR) for subsequent CMV infection was determined with a Cox model. RESULTS: 851 transplant recipients generated 3883 CMV PCR triplicates (104 blips, 307 infections, 3472 negatives, Figure 1). In the 411 positive triplicates, the OR of a triplicate being a blip decreased with increasing CMV viral load of the second measurement ([vs. = 273 IU/mL]; >273–910 IU/mL: OR 0.2 [95% CI 0.1–0.4], >910 IU/mL: OR 0.07 [95% CI 0.03–0.2], P < 0.0001) and was elevated in recipients with intermediary/low-risk CMV IgG serostatus ([vs. those with high] OR 2.2 [95% CI 1.3–3.6] P = 0.003). If the cumulative exposure to viremia in the CMV blips was >910 IU/mL, there was a higher risk of subsequent CMV infection (HR 4.6 [95% CI 1.2–17.2] P = 0.02) (Figure 2). CONCLUSION: CMV blips are frequent while screening transplant recipients with CMV PCR. CMV blips >910 IU/mL is a risk factor for subsequent infection, indicating that CMV blips at least partly reflect transient low-level CMV infection in transplant recipients. These observations suggest that first positive CMV PCR results should be confirmed before initiation of anti-CMV treatment, especially if the viral load of the first positive PCR is <910 IU/mL, or if the patient has intermediary/low-risk serostatus.

These requirements cannot be well addressed by classical culture-based approaches. Therefore, a wide range of molecular approaches has been suggested. Microarrays are molecular tools that can be used for simultaneous identification of microorganisms in clinical and environmental samples. Main advantages of microarrays are high throughput, parallelism and miniaturization of the detection system. Furthermore, they allow for both high specificity and high sensitivity of the detection. Microarrays consist of set of probes immobilized on a solid surface. Even though the first application of the microarrays can be seen as relatively recent (Schena et al. 1995), the technology developed rapidly reaching the milestone of 5,000 published papers in 2004 (Holzman and Kolker 2004). This development encompasses both the successful transfer of various technological aspects as well as the expansion of the application scope.

First, by scanning a genome, we can identify novel (homologous) pseudoknotted ncRNA, and second, we can infer the secondary structure of the target aligned sequence. We test an implementation of our algorithm (Pal), and show that it has near-perfect behavior for predicting the structure of many known pseudoknots. Additionally, it can detect the true homologs with high sensitivity and specificity in controlled tests. We also use Pal to search entire viral genome and mouse genome for novel homologs of some viral, and eukaryotic pseudoknots respectively. In each case, we have found strong support for novel homologs.","Dost, Banu; Han, Buhm; Zhang, Shaojie; Bafna, Vineet",Research in Computational Molecular Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121381/,164

Herein I will present evidence that MARs do indeed act as domain boundaries and can prevent the spread of silencing into active genes. Many fundamental questions remain unanswered about how MARs function in the nucleus. New findings in epigenetics indicate that MARs may also play an important role in the organization of genes and the eventual transport of their mRNAs through the nuclear pore.","Allen, George C.",Functional Organization of the Plant Nucleus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122480/,164

The principle concerns about emergence of antiviral resistance in infl uenza viruses are loss of drug effi cacy, transmission of resistant variants, and possible increased virulence or transmissibility of resistant variants (1). Because seasonal infl uenza is usually an acute, self-limited illness in which viral clearance occurs rapidly due to innate and adaptive host immune responses, the emergence of drug-resistant variants would be anticipated to have modest effects on clinical recovery, except perhaps in immunocompromised or immunologically naïve hosts, such as young infants or during the appearance of a novel strain. In contrast to the limited impact of resistance emergence in the treated immunocompetent individual, the epidemiologic impact of resistance emergence and transmission could be considerable, including loss of both prophylactic and therapeutic activity for a particular drug, at the household, community, or perhaps global level. Infl uenza epidemiology in temperate climates is expected to provide some protection against widespread circulation of resistant variants, as viruses do not persist between epidemics but rather are re-introduced each season and new variants appear often (2, 3).","Hayden, Frederick G.",Antimicrobial Drug Resistance,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122859/,164

Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have the capacity to spread rapidly from one region of the world to another, within a very short time, due to world travel and increased global interdependence. The impact of this varies from one region to another. Resource poor countries suffer the most due to an already high disease burden, poor infrastructures, lack of clean, potable water and sanitation, as well as an acute shortage of qualified health personnel to manage, control and contain the crisis/spread. Poor and marginalized communities are the most vulnerable because infectious diseases cause not only suffering and death, but also severe economic hardship. The outbreak of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the developing world has shown the extent to which economic and social conditions can affect vulnerable populations.

Knowledge graph embedding has been an active research area for knowledge graph completion, with great improvement from the early TransE to the current state-of-the-art ConvKB. ConvKB considers a knowledge graph as a set of triples, and employs a convolutional neural network to capture global relationships and transitional characteristics between entities and relations in the knowledge graph. However, it only utilizes the triple information, and ignores the rich information contained in relation paths. In fact, a path of one relation describes the relation from some aspect in a fine-grained way. Therefore, it is beneficial to take relation paths into consideration for knowledge graph embedding. In this paper, we present a novel convolutional neural network-based embedding model PConvKB, which improves knowledge graph embedding by incorporating relation paths locally and globally. Specifically, we introduce attention mechanism to measure the local importance of relation paths. Moreover, we propose a simple yet effective measure DIPF to compute the global importance of relation paths.

COVID-19 is emerged as a respiratory infection and a suspicious origin of animals and transmission to human in Wuhan, China on December 2019. Later this, the virus was transmitted from person to person through droplets and contacts. The World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China have taken immediate action to reduce transmission and fatality associated with COVID-19 as minimum as possible. However, action has failed to stop transmission of COVID-19 from China to other countries. Since there was no chain break of the virus, the chances are more to increase the case number and fatality. Hence, the study has been designed to perceive the current effect of COVID-19 on the global population and its fatality. The study also focused on review related to treatment for COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Online database of epidemic disease COVID-19 cases number was collected from www.channelnewsasia.com on 7(th) April 2020. This data was used to observe the past and present circumstances in the global population and its fatality. The effect of treatment on COVID-19 was reviewed from the few databases of clinical trials (antiviral and antibacterial drugs). RESULTS: The online data are used to observe a significant increase ratio of COVID-19 cases and its fatality rate in worldwide as well as country wise. The COVID-19 cases are high in the United States (27.5%), whereas the fatality rate is high in Italy (12.47%). The prevalence of COVID-19 is expected to be reaching 4 million by the end of April 2020 and the fatality rate also might be reached high. CONCLUSION: We have come to the conclusion that the effect of COVID-19 on the global population is significantly increased and the fatality rate also elevated (2.48% to 5.52%). The hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination treatment has shown significant improvement in patients with COVID-19 compared to treat with other drugs.","Palem, Siva Prasad; Palem, Hari Prasad",Indian J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217266/,164

Here, we introduce a generative model for online sharing behavior that is analytically tractable and that can reproduce several characteristics of empirical micro-blogging data on hashtag usage, such as (time-dependent) heavy-tailed distributions of meme popularity. The presented framework constitutes a null model for social spreading phenomena that, in contrast to purely empirical studies or simulation-based models, clearly distinguishes the roles of two distinct factors affecting meme popularity: the memory time of users and the connectivity structure of the social network.","Gleeson, James P.; O’Sullivan, Kevin P.; Baños, Raquel A.; Moreno, Yamir",Phys Rev X,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219474/,164

The organization of ideological discourse represents strategic, discursive acts committed by populist leaders aimed at foregrounding social conditions that would function in the advancement of various political ends—whether those ends may be the consolidation of power, the undermining of institutional systems of checks and balances, the implementation of exclusionary or injurious policies against disenfranchised constituents, the suspension of civil liberties, or a combination thereof. It is engendered through a three-stage process. In the first stage, surface-level validation by legitimate institutional actors confirms preconceived ideas about a constructed enemy. In the second stage, inflammatory rhetoric is deployed by populist leaders, which scapegoat that constructed enemy. These two stages culminate to create widespread moral panic in society. With moral panic firmly established, in the third stage an environment of fear and paranoia becomes susceptible to the enactment of symbolic and physical violence against the constructed enemy. The essay concludes with some words on the pressing need to deconstruct ideologically motivated discourses related to COVID-19.","Prasad, Ajnesh",Leadership (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222101/,164

In the twenty-first century, the life sciences—including microbiology, virology, and immunology—have been marshalled as key tools in the fight against infectious disease, and the promotion of global health. Rapid advance in these fields, however, has given rise to the “dual-use dilemma,” when one and the same piece of scientific research or technology has the capacity to help or harm humanity. While not unique to fields that address infectious disease, contemporary cases of dual-use research are largely identified in the context of the life sciences. In this chapter I outline the debate about dual-use research in the life sciences, in particular the ethics of dual-use research. After a historical overview of the dual-use dilemma in the twenty-first century, I examine ethical issues in attempting to trade off the risks and benefits of dual-use research. I address how we select alternative, less risky experiments; translational issues arising for dual-use research; and political commitments to realise the benefits and mitigate the risks arising from such research. I then discuss the governance of dual-use research, before concluding with a brief discussion on priority setting in infectious disease research as a path forward for policymakers.","Evans, Nicholas G.",Infectious Diseases in the New Millennium,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7226902/,164
33021,Letters,2020-05-09,"BACKGROUND: Major trauma often comprises fractures of the thoracolumbar spine and these are often accompanied by relevant thoracic trauma. Major complications can be ascribed to substantial simultaneous trauma to the chest and concomitant immobilization due to spinal instability, pain or neurological dysfunction, impairing the respiratory system individually and together. Thus, we proposed that an early stabilization of thoracolumbar spine fractures will result in significant benefits regarding respiratory organ function, multiple organ failure and length of ICU / hospital stay. METHODS: Patients documented in the TraumaRegister DGU®, aged ≥16 years, ISS ≥ 16, AIS(Thorax) ≥ 3 with a concomitant thoracic and / or lumbar spine injury severity (AIS(Spine)) ≥ 3 were analyzed. Penetrating injuries and severe injuries to head, abdomen or extremities (AIS ≥ 3) led to patient exclusion. Groups with fractures of the lumbar (LS) or thoracic spine (TS) were formed according to the severity of spinal trauma (AIS(spine)): AIS(LS) = 3, AIS(LS) = 4–5, AIS(TS) = 3 and AIS(TS) = 4–5, respectively. RESULTS: 1740 patients remained for analysis, with 1338 (76.9%) undergoing spinal surgery within their hospital stay. 976 (72.9%) had spine surgery within the first 72 h, 362 (27.1%) later on. Patients with injuries to the thoracic spine (AIS(TS) = 3) or lumbar spine (AIS(LS) = 3) significantly benefit from early surgical intervention concerning ventilation time (AIS(LS) = 3 only), ARDS, multiple organ failure, sepsis rate (AIS(TS) = 3 only), length of stay in the intensive care unit and length of hospital stay. In multiple injured patients with at least severe thoracic spine trauma (AIS(TS) ≥ 4) early surgery showed a significantly shorter ventilation time, decreased sepsis rate as well as shorter time spend in the ICU and in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Multiply injured patients with at least serious thoracic trauma (AIS(Thorax) ≥ 3) and accompanying spine trauma can significantly benefit from early spine stabilization within the first 72 h after hospital admission. Based on the presented data, primary spine surgery within 72 h for fracture stabilization in multiply injured patients with leading thoracic trauma, especially in patients suffering from fractures of the thoracic spine, seems to be beneficial.","Hager, Sven; Eberbach, Helge; Lefering, Rolf; Hammer, Thorsten O.; Kubosch, David; Jäger, Christoph; Südkamp, Norbert P.; Bayer, Jörg",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245984/,164

Additionally, the effect of starch granules on the growth parameters and survival of broiler chickens exposed to treated litter was examined. In this study, granules containing 3, 5, and 10% carvacrol was used. In a simulated chicken house bioassay, this material was mixed with pellets in three different proportions: 30/70%, 40/60%, and 50/50% (granules/pellets, respectively). On this medium, young larvae (approximately 10 days old), older larvae (last stage before pupa), and unsexed 7–10 days old adults of the lesser mealworm, with access to food, were colonized. Experiments were performed at 29°C in the dark. The study shows that poultry litter with the addition of starch granules enriched with 10% of carvacrol in the proportion of 40:60% (granules:pellets) appears to be the optimal medium applicable to broiler houses for A. diaperinus control. In this environment, all larvae and adults died within 3–4 days and the overall development of the experimental chickens was similar to that of the control. However, the feed conversion rate was slightly higher in the treated group (1.72) than in the control group (1.56). The average final body weight in the treated group was 100 g lower than that in the control group (the differences were not statistically significant).","Szczepanik, Maryla; Raszkowska-Kaczor, Aneta; Olkiewicz, Daria; Bajer, Dagmara; Bajer, Krzysztof",J Poult Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7248010/,164

In a recent paper, a natural extension of OWA operators to the setting of multidimensional data has been proposed based on the use of a linear extension of the product order by means of several weighted arithmetic means. Unfortunately, OWA operators constructed in such a way focus too strongly on the level sets of one of the weighted arithmetic means. It is here shown that this focus ultimately results in a forfeit of the properties of continuity and robustness in the presence of outliers.","Pérez-Fernández, Raúl",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274720/,164

We wanted to describe critically ill patients with severe sepsis or septic shock due to invasive GAS (iGAS) and compare them with other patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. METHODS: Adult patients admitted to a general intensive care unit (ICU) in Sweden (2007–2019) were screened for severe sepsis or septic shock according to Sepsis 2 definition. Individuals with iGAS infection were identified. The outcome variables were mortality, days alive and free of vasopressors and invasive mechanical ventilation, maximum acute kidney injury score for creatinine, use of continuous renal replacement therapy and maximum Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score during the ICU stay. Age, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS 3) and iGAS were used as independent, explanatory variables in regression analysis. Cox regression was used for survival analyses. RESULTS: iGAS was identified in 53 of 1021 (5.2%) patients. Patients with iGAS presented a lower median SAPS 3 score (62 [56–72]) vs 71 [61–81]), p < 0.001), had a higher frequency of cardiovascular cause of admission to the ICU (38 [72%] vs 145 [15%], p < 0.001) and had a higher median creatinine score (173 [100–311] vs 133 [86–208] μmol/L, p < 0.019). Of the GAS isolates, 50% were serotyped emm1/T1 and this group showed signs of more pronounced circulatory and renal failure than patients with non-emm1/T1 (p = 0.036 and p = 0.007, respectively). After correction for severity of illness (SAPS 3) and age, iGAS infection was associated with lower mortality risk (95% confidence interval (CI) of hazard ratio (HR) 0.204–0.746, p < 0.001). Morbidity analyses demonstrated that iGAS patients were more likely to develop renal failure. CONCLUSION: Critically ill patients with iGAS infection had a lower mortality risk but a higher degree of renal failure compared to similarly ill sepsis patients. emm1/T1 was found to be the most dominant serotype, and patients with emm1/T1 demonstrated more circulatory and renal failure than patients with other serotypes of iGAS.","Björck, Viveka; Påhlman, Lisa I.; Bodelsson, Mikael; Petersson, Ann-Cathrine; Kander, Thomas",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7275847/,164

With the improvement in observation networks, data assimilation of internal magma state using time-history crustal deformation data observed at the surface is expected to be suitable for solving such problems. Using finite-element methods capable of modeling complex geometry is desirable for modeling the three-dimensional heterogeneous crust structure, and nonlinear time-history analysis is required for considering the change in material properties due to the movement of magma. Thus, many cases of large-scale finite-element analysis is required, and the computational cost incurred is expected to become a bottleneck. As a basic study towards data assimilation of internal magma state considering change in material properties of the crust, we demonstrated that many case analyses of volcano deformation problems can be conducted in a reasonable time frame by development of a crustal deformation analysis method accelerated by GPUs. For verification of the data assimilation method, we estimated the magma trend in an actual three-dimensional heterogeneous crust structure without temporal change in material properties. We confirmed that the magma movement trend can be reproduced using the model considering crust heterogeneity, while models disregarding three-dimensional crust structure resulted in wrong estimations. Thus, we can see that using finite-element methods capable of modeling three-dimensional heterogeneity for crustal deformation analysis is important for accurate magma state estimation.","Murakami, Sota; Yamaguchi, Takuma; Fujita, Kohei; Ichimura, Tsuyoshi; Lalith, Maddagedara; Hori, Muneo",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304054/,164

An unsaturated flow test case was considered where the elapsed times of both the non quantized execution and the execution run by setting the quantization threshold to zero (with respect to the moist content variable) were already evaluated. The model response has been assessed in terms of both accuracy and computational performance in the case of an MPI/OpenMP hybrid execution.

35227,The Computational Significance of Hausdorff’s Maximal Chain Principle,2020-06-24,"Multiscale modelling and simulation typically entails coupling multiple simulation codes into a single program. Doing this in an ad-hoc fashion tends to result in a tightly coupled, difficult-to-change computer program. This makes it difficult to experiment with different submodels, or to implement advanced techniques such as surrogate modelling. Furthermore, building the coupling itself is time-consuming. The MUltiScale Coupling Library and Environment version 3 (MUSCLE 3) aims to alleviate these problems. It allows the coupling to be specified in a simple configuration file, which specifies the components of the simulation and how they should be connected together. At runtime a simulation manager takes care of coordination of submodels, while data is exchanged over the network in a peer-to-peer fashion via the MUSCLE library.

This system of equations is arising in the context of optimal switching problem when both sides of the balance sheet are considered. This problem incorporates both the action of switching between investment modes and the action of abandoning the investment project before its maturity once it becomes unprofitable. Pricing such real options (switch option and abandon option) is equivalent to solve the system of coupled RBSDEs considered in the paper, for which we show the existence of a continuous adapted minimal solution via a Picard iteration method.","Belfadli, Rachid; Eddahbi, M’hamed; Fakhouri, Imade; Ouknine, Youssef",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304763/,164

The unique characteristics of the research software produce challenges in the testing process that require attention. Aims: Therefore, the goal of this paper is to share the experience of implementing a testing framework using a statistical approach for a specific type of research software, i.e. non-deterministic software. Method: Using the ParSplice research software project as a case, we implemented a testing framework based on a statistical testing approach called Multinomial Test. Results: Using the new framework, we were able to test the ParSplice project and demonstrate correctness in a situation where traditional methodical testing approaches were not feasible. Conclusions: This study opens up the possibilities of using statistical testing approaches for research software that can overcome some of the inherent challenges involved in testing non-deterministic research software.","Eisty, Nasir U.; Perez, Danny; Carver, Jeffrey C.; Moulton, J.

The high communicability of the COVID-19 necessitates robust medical preparedness and vigilance. OBJECTIVE: To report on the simulation-based training and test preparedness activities to prepare healthcare workers (HCWs) for effective and safe handling of patients with COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: Two activities were conducted: simulation-based training to all HCWs and a full-scale unannounced simulation-based disaster exercise at King Fahad Medical City (KFMC). The online module was designed to enhance the knowledge on COVID-19. This module was available to all KFMC staff. The five hands-on practical part of the course was available to frontliner HCWs. The unannounced undercover simulated patients’ full-scale COVID-19 simulation-based disaster exercise took place in the emergency department over 3 hours. Six scenarios were executed to test the existing plan in providing care of suspected COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: 2620 HCWs took the online module, 17 courses were conducted and 337 frontliner HCWs were trained. 94% of learners were satisfied and recommended the activity to others. The overall compliance rate of the full-scale COVID-19 disaster drill with infection control guidelines was 90%. Post-drill debriefing sessions recommended reinforcing PPE training, ensuring availability of different sizes of PPEs and developing an algorithm to transfer patients to designated quarantine areas. CONCLUSION: Simulation-based training and preparedness testing activities are vital in identifying gaps to apply corrective actions immediately.

35671,Combined Covers and Beth Definability,2020-05-30,"BACKGROUND: Malaria is a major travel medicine issue. Retrospective confirmation of a malaria episode diagnosed in an endemic area can have relevant implications in transfusional medicine in Europe, where blood donors are excluded from donation on the basis of positive malaria serology. However, there is scarce evidence on the dynamics of anti-malarial antibodies after a first malaria episode in non-immune individuals. The first aim of this study was to describe the dynamics of anti-malarial antibodies in a first malaria episode in non-immune travellers. Secondary objectives were to assess the sensitivity of serology for a retrospective diagnosis in non-immune travellers diagnosed while abroad and to discuss the implications in transfusional medicine. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the results of an indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT) for malaria available for patients with a first malaria episode by Plasmodium falciparum and admitted at the IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria hospital in a 14-year period. The antibody titres were collected at baseline and during further follow up visits. Epidemiological, demographic and laboratory test results (including full blood count and malaria parasite density) were anonymously recorded in a study specific electronic Case Report Form created with OpenClinica software. Statistical analysis was performed with SAS software version 9.4. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were included. Among them, all but two were Europeans (one African and one American). Median length of fever before diagnosis was 2 days (IQR 1–3). Thirty-five patients had seroconversion between day 1 and day 4 from admission, and the titre showed a sharply rising titre, often to a very high level in a few days. Only a single patient remained negative in the first 5 days from admission, after which he was no more tested. Six patients were followed up for at least 2 months, and they all showed a decline in IFAT titre, tending to seroreversion (confirmed in one patient with the longest follow up, almost 4 years). CONCLUSIONS: Serology demonstrated reliable for retrospective diagnosis in non-immune travellers. The decline in the anti-malarial titre might be included in the screening algorithms of blood donors, but further studies are needed.","Bisoffi, Zeno; Bertoldi, Marco; Silva, Ronaldo; Bertoli, Giulia; Ursini, Tamara; Marocco, Stefania; Piubelli, Chiara; Pomari, Elena; Buonfrate, Dora; Gobbi, Federico",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7316638/,164

However, most methods for learning from demonstrations either do not provide guarantees that the learned artifacts can be safely composed or do not explicitly capture temporal properties. Motivated by this deficit, recent works have proposed learning Boolean task specifications, a class of Boolean non-Markovian rewards which admit well-defined composition and explicitly handle historical dependencies. This work continues this line of research by adapting maximum causal entropy inverse reinforcement learning to estimate the posteriori probability of a specification given a multi-set of demonstrations. The key algorithmic insight is to leverage the extensive literature and tooling on reduced ordered binary decision diagrams to efficiently encode a time unrolled Markov Decision Process. This enables transforming a naïve algorithm with running time exponential in the episode length, into a polynomial time algorithm.","Vazquez-Chanlatte, Marcell; Seshia, Sanjit A.",Computer Aided Verification,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363230/,164

In this paper, we propose to introduce a design concept on user experience (UX), which is extensively studied in the software engineering and computer science research, as a design tool. When the curriculum is improved, not only the body of knowledge is changed, the changes also affect all related resources and activities. If some of them was not well prepared, it would become the obstructions. The UX design/analysis is a process that uses meaningful experiences of all users in all aspects, such as resources, management, usability, and implementation. All related action roles to the system in the past is needed to be analyzed. The new curriculum should be designed based on possibility of implementation and optimized based on the user experience in the future.

METHODS: The ascorbic acid and thiamine effect in septic shock (ATESS) trial was a multi-centre, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial conducted in four academic emergency departments, enrolling adult patients with septic shock from December 2018 through January 2020. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the treatment group [intravenous vitamin C (50 mg/kg, maximum single dose 3 g) and thiamine (200 mg) administration every 12 h for a total of 48 h] or the placebo group (identical volume of 0.9% saline with the same protocol). The primary outcome was Δ Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (SOFA score at enrolment–SOFA score after 72 h). Eighteen secondary outcomes were predefined, including shock reversal and 28-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 111 patients were enrolled, of which 53 were assigned to the treatment group and 58 were assigned to the placebo group. There was no significant difference in ΔSOFA scores between the treatment group and the placebo group [3, interquartile range (IQR) − 1 to 5 vs. 3, IQR 0–4, respectively, p = 0.96]. Predefined secondary outcomes were also not significantly different between the groups.

Healthcare systems found themselves struggling to increase capacity and procure key supplies, such as personal protective equipment. Protective face shields became essential for healthcare professionals. However, most hospitals and healthcare facilities did not have them in adequate quantities. The urgency of producing and delivering face shields increased as the number of COVID-19 cases rapidly multiplied. This was the situation that we encountered in the city and province of Burgos (Spain). Since there was no time to wait for a large manufacturer to produce face shields, private citizens and small companies volunteered to make them using technologies such as 3D printers. Nonprofits, citizens, and governments agencies volunteered to deliver materials to the face shield makers and to pick up and deliver the face shields to health centers and other locations where they were needed. This resulted in a vehicle routing problem with some special characteristics that made it different from models used for commercial purposes. We describe the development of a heuristic to find feasible and efficient routes for this problem. We highlight the advantages of using heuristics in an emergency context like the one triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Represented visually, the assessments of public health status are better understood and also more effectively communicated for action. The geographic or spatial components of the surveillance data enable the natural application of visualization techniques for computerized assistance for decision making in spatial (and often spatial-temporal) analytics (e.g., clustering detection and resource logistics). In addition, the interplay between simulation and visualization provides a powerful combination. Visualization techniques can be used to analyze simulation output and analysis results, and can drastically improve the understandability and accessibility of the model to both technical and nontechnical audiences. Virtually all simulation software packages have some level of visualization, ranging from basic diagrams to full animation. This chapter provides a systematic summarization of data visualization techniques that are employed in the surveyed syndromic surveillance systems.

Though usually seasonal in temperate climates, influenza occurs throughout the year in the tropics with outbreaks occurring at irregular intervals. On February 6, 2018, a number of students from a Senior High School (SHS) in Accra reported to a district hospital with cough, fever and other respiratory symptoms. An influenza-like illness (ILI) outbreak was suspected. We investigated to determine the magnitude and source of the outbreak and implement control and preventive measures. METHODS: We interviewed health workers, staff and students of the school as well as case-patients and reviewed health records to collect data on demographic characteristics, signs and symptoms, date of illness onset and outcome. We defined ILI case as “any person in the SHS with fever (measured axillary temperature of ≥ 37.5 °C or history of fever) and cough with or without sore throat or runny nose from January 21 to February 26, 2018”. We conducted active case search to identify more cases and took oropharyngeal samples for laboratory testing. We performed descriptive and inferential analysis by calculating attack rate ratios (ARR) and their exact 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Of the 3160 students, 104 case-patients were recorded from January 25, 2018 to February 13, 2018 (overall attack rate of 3.3%). Mean age of case-patients was 16.1 (±2.3) years with males constituting 71.2% (74/104). Sex specific attack rates were 5.6% (74/1331) and 1.6% (30/1829) for males and females respectively. Compared to females, males were 3.4 times as likely to be ill [ARR =3.4, 95%CI = (2.23–5.15)]. Nine oropharyngeal samples from 17 suspected case-patients tested positive for influenza A (H1N1)pdm09. CONCLUSION: Outbreak of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 occurred in a SHS in Accra from January to February, 2018. Even though source of the outbreak could not be determined, prompt case management and health education on hand and personal hygiene as non-pharmacological factors probably contributed to the outbreak control. The outbreak ended with a scheduled mid-term break. This underscores the need for more evidence on the effect of school closure in influenza outbreak control.","Ameme, Donne Kofi; Dadzie, Dora; Asiedu-Bekoe, Franklin; Edu-Quansah, Elijah Paa; Kaburi, Basil Benduri; Wullar, Oxygen; Amo-Mensah, Patrick; Kenu, Ernest",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7499409/,164

The tweets follow up can be useful to timely evidence “media storms” or “infodemics” thus suggesting corrective interventions. The spread of Covid-19 has been the occasion to observe the evolution of tweets about this topic, with the aim of evidence peaks of fear METHODS: On 30th January 2020 we started a large collection of Italian and English tweets containing the following keywords: “coronavirus”, “2019-nCov”, “CoronavirusOutbreak”, “CoronavirusWho”, “WuhanCoronavirus”, “coronaviruschina”, “coronavirusitalia”, “virus cina”, “virus cinese”, “virus mascherine”, “virus paura”, “virus polmonite” and “virus vaccine”. “Covid-19” and “SARS-CoV-2” were added later. For the data collection Twitter Streaming API was used. RESULTS: The total number of tweets collected till 26th February was approximately 20M, 2M in Italian and 18M in English. The trend of the volume of tweets gathered shows a first small peak between Jan 30th and Feb 1st, but a second, higher, peak is visible after the 21st February, following the report of the Covid-19 clusters in Italy. Italian tweets account for 6% of the first peak and for 22% of the second. The Italian word “paura” firstly appeared on Feb 5th, with a peak after Feb 21th. CONCLUSIONS: ”infodemics” or “media storms”, are situations of uncontrolled diffusion of news and opinion, frequently leading to irrational and counterproductive behaviors. The Italian evolution of tweets indicate since the first day of cluster report, a clear escalation of fear, that suggests timely corrective actions to facilitate the disease control. KEY MESSAGES: With the twitter monitoring we demonstrate that since 21th February an infodemic is spreading in Italy. The twitter follow up can be used to timely evidence a public alarm, motivate corrective interventions and. evaluate the efficacy of them.","Calamusa, A; Tardelli, S; Avvenuti, M; Cresci, S; Federigi, I; Tesconi, M; Verani, M; Carducci, A",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543462/,164

40967,Kortikosteroide senken die 28-Tage-Mortalität,2020-10-26,"BACKGROUND: Turnover intention is a probability of an employee to leave the current institution within a certain period due to various factors. It is the strongest predictor of actual turnover expected to increase as the intention increases. Emergency Department (ED) nurses are especially vulnerable to high turnover because of their increased risk of developing burnout and compassion fatigue associated with the work environment. This study is aimed to assess nurses’ intention to leave emergency departments and associated factors at selected governmental hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted on 102 nurses in three selected governmental hospitals, Addis Ababa from February 19 to March 31, 2018, using a structured pre-tested self-administered questionnaire. The logistic regression model was used and an adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was calculated to identify associated factors. RESULT: A total of 102 respondents were involved with a response rate of 91.1%. Among them, 79 (77.5%) respondents had the intention to leave the current working unit of the emergency department or hospital. Significant predictive factors of nurses’ intention to leave their institutions are educational status (adjusted odds ratio (OR) =4.700, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.033–50.772; p < 0.048), monthly income of less than 3145 Birr (adjusted OR = 6.05, 95% CI = 1.056–34.641; p < 0.043) and professional autonomy (adjusted OR = 0.191, 95% CI = 0.040–0.908; p < 0.037). CONCLUSION: More than 77% of the respondents have the intention to leave their current working place of the emergency unit. Educational status, monthly income, and autonomy were significantly associated with emergency nurses’ turnover intention in three governmental hospitals. Emergency leaders and hospital managers should have made efforts to enhance nurses’ decision making for patient care activities and shared decision overwork or unit related activities.","Wubetie, Andualem; Taye, Biniyam; Girma, Biruk",BMC Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7556577/,164
40995,Service Function Chaining Based on Segment Routing Using P4 and SR-IOV (P4-SFC),2020-09-15,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in southern China and southeast Asia. Emerging evidence revealed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) might play important roles in the development and progression of many cancers, including NPC. The functions and mechanisms of the vast majority of lncRNAs involved in NPC remain unknown. In this study, a novel lncRNA RP11-624L4.1 was identified in NPC tissues using next-generation sequencing. In situ hybridization (ISH) was used to analyze the correlation between RP11-624L4.1 expression and the clinicopathological features or prognosis in NPC patients. RPISeq predictions and RIP assays were used to identify RP11-624L4.1’s interactions with CDK4. As a result, we found RP11-624L4.1 is hyper-expressed in NPC tissues, which was associated with unfavorable prognosis and clinicopathological features in NPC. By knocking down and over-expressing RP11-624L4.1, we also found that it promotes the proliferation ability of NPC in vitro and in vivo through CDK4/6-CyclinD1-Rb-E2F1 pathway. Overexpression of CDK4 in knocking down RP11-624L4.1 cells can partially rescue NPC promotion, indicating its role of RP11-624L4.1-CDK4/6-CyclinD1–Rb-E2F1 pathway. Taken together, RP11-624L4.1 is required for NPC unfavorable prognosis and proliferation through CDK4/6-CyclinD1-Rb-E2F1 pathway, which may be a novel target for therapeutic and prognostic in patients with NPC.","Zhou, Liuying; Liu, Ruijie; Liang, Xujun; Zhang, Sai; Bi, Wu; Yang, Mei; He, Yi; Jin, Jin; Li, Shisheng; Yang, Xinming; Fu, Junjiang; Zhang, Pengfei",Mol Ther Nucleic Acids,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7558227/,164
41378,Endlich Farbe bekennen,2020-11-04,"The ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions of people worldwide and with notable heterogeneity in its clinical presentation. Probability of contracting this highly contagious infection is similar across age groups but disease severity and fatality among aged patients with or without comorbidities are reportedly higher. Previous studies suggest that age associated transcriptional changes in lung and immune system results in a proinflammatory state and increased susceptibility to infectious lung diseases. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 infection could augment ageing-related gene expression alterations resulting in severe outcomes in elderly patients. To identify genes that can potentially increase covid-19 disease severity in ageing people, we compared age associated gene expression changes with disease-associated expression changes in lung/BALF and whole blood obtained from publicly available data. We observed (i) a significant overlap of gene expression profiles of patients’ BALF and blood with lung and blood of the healthy group, respectively; (ii) a more pronounced overlap in blood compared to lung; and (iii) a similar overlap between host genes interacting with SARS-CoV-2 and ageing blood transcriptome. Pathway enrichment analysis of overlapping gene sets suggest that infection alters expression of genes already dysregulated in the elderly, which together may lead to poor prognosis. eQTLs in these genes may also confer poor outcome in young patients worsening with age and comorbidities. Further, the pronounced overlap observed in blood may explain clinical symptoms including blood clots, strokes, heart attack, multi-organ failure etc. in severe cases. This model based on a limited patient dataset seems robust and holds promise for testing larger tissue specific datasets from patients with varied severity and across populations.

41518,News-Screen Rheumatologie,2020-11-03,"The article focuses on scientific disagreement about the use of statin-related drugs in the prevention of cardiovascular events. The study forms part of an exploration of the broader principle of research polarization, foremost in medicine. The hypothesis is that statin-positive and statin-critical researchers publish in different committed central journals, and that they are financially supported by different dedicated corporate sources. Methodologically we use Web of Science (WoS) analytic tools to perform publication analysis of a time series covering 1998–2018 in three seven-year windows. For each window data is captured based on sets of known statin-positive and statin-critical articles and researchers, and their primary and secondary co-authors. Standard deviation is used as a focused normalization and visual instrument together with Spearman’s correlation coefficient in order to compare frequency distributions of statin-positive and critical journal and sponsor articles. Z-test p-values are used to assess the probability of error concerning the distributions. Findings at general topical level showed that a few journals consistently and significantly occupied top positions, 2 of which, American Journal of Cardiology and Circulation, published articles from both positions. Besides, Journal of the American College of Cardiology served as a major publisher of statin-positive research from 2005, as did European Heart Journal from 2012, replacing American Journal of Cardiology at the top. From 2012 Atherosclerosis and European Journal of Preventive Cardiology served as top-publishers of statin-critical articles. Two central US funding agencies, US Department of Health Human Services and National Institutes of Health (NIH), operated at general topical level across the time series, but the agencies played only a minor role in the divergent research positions. From 2005 statin-positive as well as statin-critical research was mainly sponsored by multinational pharmaceutical companies, predominantly Merck, AstraZeneca and Pfizer. In conclusion, the initial hypothesis about dedicated journals and sponsors was entirely substantiated at the general topical level and at the journal level of research disagreement, but not at sponsor level. Distinct dedicated journals were extracted separately from the 2 divergent statin positions. Since the WoS coverage of sponsor data 1998–2004 was sporadic sponsor data are analyzed from 2005. Only from 2012 the WoS sponsor coverage of the topic is consistently at 60%.","Ingwersen, Peter; Holm, Soeren; Larsen, Birger; Ploug, Thomas",Scientometrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7594968/,164

The purpose of this study is to use machine learning to identify clinical phenotypes for critically ill patients with MV in intensive care units (ICUs). METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted with 5013 patients who had undergone MV and treatment in the Department of Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Statistical and machine learning methods were used. All the data used in this study, including demographics, vital signs, circulation parameters and mechanical ventilator parameters, etc., were automatically extracted from the electronic health record (EHR) system. An external database, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III), was used for validation. RESULTS: Phenotypes were derived from a total of 4009 patients who underwent MV using a latent profile analysis of 22 variables. The associations between the phenotypes and disease severity and clinical outcomes were assessed. Another 1004 patients in the database were enrolled for validation. Of the five derived phenotypes, phenotype I was the most common subgroup (n = 2174; 54.2%) and was mostly composed of the postoperative population. Phenotype II (n = 480; 12.0%) led to the most severe conditions. Phenotype III (n = 241; 6.01%) was associated with high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and low mean airway pressure. Phenotype IV (n = 368; 9.18%) was associated with high driving pressure, and younger patients comprised a large proportion of the phenotype V group (n = 746; 18.6%). In addition, we found that the mortality rate of Phenotype IV was significantly higher than that of the other phenotypes. In this subgroup, the number of patients in the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score segment (9,22] was 198, the number of deaths was 88, and the mortality rate was higher than 44%. However, the cumulative 28-day mortality of Phenotypes IV and II, which were 101 of 368 (27.4%) and 87 of 480 (18.1%) unique patients, respectively, was significantly higher than those of the other phenotypes. There were consistent phenotype distributions and differences in biomarker patterns by phenotype in the validation cohort, and external verification with MIMIC III further generated supportive results. CONCLUSIONS: Five clinical phenotypes were correlated with different disease severities and clinical outcomes, which suggested that these phenotypes may help in understanding heterogeneity in MV treatment effects.","Su, Longxiang; Zhang, Zhongheng; Zheng, Fanglan; Pan, Pan; Hong, Na; Liu, Chun; He, Jie; Zhu, Weiguo; Long, Yun; Liu, Dawei",Respir Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7727781/,164

Older adults, a high-risk group for developing serious complications from COVID-19, are asked to shelter-in-place limiting physical interactions. We aimed to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on social isolation and loneliness among community-dwelling older adults previously enrolled in in-person exercise classes in the Leveraging Exercise to Age in Place (LEAP) study before March 19th, 2020 when California started shelter-in-place. We conducted a pre-post analysis of cognitively intact participants (n=59) >50 years, who had social connectedness, loneliness, and demographic data collected pre- and post-COVID shelter-in-place. Participants’ social connectedness was measured via the 11-question Duke Social Support Index (DSSI) and loneliness via the 3-question UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA 3). Participants had an average (±SD) baseline DSSI of 27.2 (± 3.5) and UCLA 3 of 4.8 (± 1.7) and were an average of 76.6 ± 9.2 years, 81% female, 63% white, 29% widowed, 42% living alone, 27% acting as caregivers, and 44% were diagnosed with 3 or more chronic health conditions. We completed post-assessments on average 61 ± 29 days after the start of shelter-in-place. Results of the paired t-tests indicated no statistically significant difference in social connectedness and loneliness pre- and post-shelter-in-place. Reasons for lack of observed change include: limitations of a small sample size, possible protective factors from enrollment in the LEAP program, or insufficient time at post-assessment to develop changes in loneliness and social isolation.

An estimated 80% of all COVID-19 deaths in Canada were associated with LTC outbreaks as of May 25, 2020. Infection control measures have swiftly changed the environment in many LTC homes for residents, workers, loved ones, and other supports. Registered Dietitians (RDs) are among the many care professionals working in LTC affected by these changes. The aim of this qualitative study was to examine the roles of RDs in supporting LTC residents during the initial phases of the pandemic. RDs faced remote practice, redeployment to address pandemic priorities, or cohorting to a sole practice site, yet were responsible for resident nutritional health. In-depth, web-based, semi-structured interviews with thirteen RDs working in LTC in a prairie province of Canada were used to explore the changes to work, challenges faced, impact on residents, and innovations in practice. The findings from this study capture nutrition and wellness-related implications of the COVID-19 pandemic within LTC homes.

43733,Industry Updates,2021-01-02,"Influenza D virus (IDV), a novel orthomyxovirus, is currently emerging in cattle worldwide. It shares >50% sequence similarity with the human influenza C virus (HICV). Two clades of IDV are currently co-circulating in cattle herds in the U.S. New assays specific for each lineage are needed for accurate surveillance. Also, differential diagnosis between zoonotic human influenza C virus and the two clades of IDV are important to assess the zoonotic potential of IDV. We developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on two different epitopes HEF and NP and four peptides, and fluorescent focus neutralization assay to differentiate between IDV bovine and swine clades. Calf sera were obtained, and bovine samples underwent surveillance. Our results highlight the importance of position 215 with 212 in determining the heterogeneity between the two lineages. We needed IFA and FFN for tissue culture–based analysis and a BSL2 facility for analyzing virus interactions. Unfortunately, these are not available in many veterinary centers. Hence, our second aim was to develop an iELISA using specific epitopes to detect two lineages of IDVs simultaneously. Epitope-iELISA accurately detects neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies against the IDV in non-BSL2 laboratories and veterinary clinics and is cost-effective and sensitive. To differentiate between IDVs and HICVs, whole antigen blocking, polypeptides, and single-peptide ELISAs were developed. A panel of ferret sera against both viruses was used. Results suggested that both IDV and ICV had a common ancestor, and IDV poses a zoonotic risk to individuals with prior or current exposure to cattle. IDV peptides IANAGVK (286–292 aa), KTDSGR (423–428 aa), and RTLTPAT (448–455 aa) could differentiate between the two viruses, whereas peptide AESSVNPGAKPQV (203–215 aa) detected the presence of IDV in human sera but could not deny that it could be ICV, because the only two conserved influenza C peptides shared 52% sequence similarity with IDV and cross-reacted with IDV. However, blocking ELISAs differentiated between the two viruses. Diagnostic tools and assays to differentiate between ICV and IDV are required for serological and epidemiological analysis to clarify the complexity and evolution and eliminate misdiagnosis between ICV and IDV in human samples.","Okda, Faten A.; Griffith, Elizabeth; Sakr, Ahmed; Nelson, Eric; Webby, Richard",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7759653/,164

To better understand the length of viral shedding in children and potential infection control implications, we describe 51 children with COVID-19 who underwent repeat testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at Texas Children’s Hospital (TCH). METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of all pediatric patients (< 21 years of age) with ≥ 2 nasopharyngeal specimens tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) and at least one positive result between 3/13/2020 and 6/7/2020 through the TCH Molecular Microbiology Laboratory. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients met inclusion criteria. The median age was 8.6 years (0.02–19.2 years). Sixteen (31%) children were hospitalized. Fourteen (27%) patients underwent testing for surveillance purposes (including 3 admitted patients). Two SARS-CoV-2 tests were performed in 25 (49%) children; while 12 (24%) children had 3 tests, 4 (8%) children had 4 tests, and 10 (20%) children had ≥ 5 tests (including 1 patient with underlying malignancy who had 9 SARS-CoV-2 PCRs performed). SARS-CoV-2 testing timeline for 9 hospitalized children is shown (Fig 1). The median time between collection of tests 1 and 2 was 14 days (n=51, range 1, 53 days). For children with conversion (first detected to first not-detected sample), the median time was 15 days (n=31, range 1, 45 days). For patients with consecutive positive SARS-CoV-2 PCRs, the median time of positivity was 10 days (n=19, range 2, 31). One patient with malignancy had 5 tests over 6 weeks in the outpatient setting and each time alternated between detected and not-detected. Following diagnosis with COVID-19, one patient with sickle cell disease likely had re-infection and had a positive test after having 2 consecutive negative tests; his last SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR was positive 68 days after initial positive.

Poor health can be a potential consequence of loneliness, as well as a determining factor. Thus, the objective of the current study was to determine whether postponed dental appointments due to costs affect loneliness longitudinally. Focusing on Germany, data from two waves (waves 5 and 6) of the “Survey of Health Ageing, and Retirement in Europe” (SHARE) were analyzed (n = 7703). The three-item loneliness scale (modified version of the revised UCLA Loneliness scale) was used to quantify loneliness. The presence of postponed dental appointments due to costs in the past 12 months (no; yes) served as a key independent variable. Socioeconomic factors as well as health-related factors were adjusted in the longitudinal regression analysis. After adjusting for confounding variables, regression analyses revealed that loneliness increased with decreases in self-rated health among men. Among women, loneliness increased when self-rated health decreased, when fewer chronic diseases and postponed dental appointments due to costs were reported. Among older women, postponed dental appointments due to costs are associated with feelings of loneliness. The study results add evidence that proper dental care (i.e., regular and appropriate visits to the dentist) is vital not only to one’s oral health, but also plays a role in one’s physical and emotional health.","Walther, Carolin; Aarabi, Ghazal; Valdez, Richelle; Spinler, Kristin; Heydecke, Guido; Buczak-Stec, Elzbieta; König, Hans-Helmut; Hajek, André",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7795797/,164

Some vaccines are in the last stages of testing. Overall mortality rates vary between countries, for example, from a minimum of 0.05% in Singapore to a maximum of 9.75 in Mexico; however, mortality and severity of COVID-19 are higher in the elderly and in those with comorbidities already present such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. MAIN TEXT: Recent evidence has shown that an underlying liver disease can also be a risk factor, and SARS-CoV-2 itself can cause direct or indirect damage to liver tissue through multisystem inflammation generated especially in the more severe stages. In the current pandemic, liver dysfunction has been observed in 14–53% of patients with severe COVID-19. In addition, drugs administered during infection may be an additional factor of liver damage. The mechanism of cellular penetration of the virus that occurs by viral entry is through the receptors of the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE-2) host that are abundantly present in type II pneumocytes, heart cells, but also liver cholangiocytes. CONCLUSION: In this manuscript, we describe the clinical management aimed at preserving the liver or reducing the damage caused by COVID-19 and anti-COVID-19 drug treatments.","Vitiello, Antonio; La Porta, Raffaele; D’Aiuto, Vilma; Ferrara, Francesco",Egypt Liver Journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7838235/,164
45266,Aging Behavior of Water-Based YSZ Suspensions for Plasma Spraying of Thermal Barrier Coatings,2021-01-31,"PURPOSE: To assess the impact of the Personal Optimism With Exercise Recovery (POWER) program on cancer treatment–related side effects among rural cancer survivors. METHODS: In this retrospective study of data collected between 2016 and 2019, we assessed change in cardiorespiratory fitness, whole-body muscular endurance, physical function and strength, anthropometrics, fatigue, and quality of life (QoL), after participation in POWER. Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic and clinical variables. Univariate analysis of variance was carried out with age and BMI at initial assessment as covariates. RESULTS: A total of 239 survivors, 78% rural residents, completed a follow-up assessment. Among rural cancer survivors, the most prevalent cancer sites were breast (42.5%), prostate (12.4%), and lymphoma (5.9%). The majority of survivors were female (70%), non-Hispanic (94.6%), and white (93.5%), with average age and BMI of 62.1 ± 13.2 years and 28.4 ± 6.7 kg/m(2), respectively. Rural cancer survivors with cancer stages I–III exhibited significant improvements in fitness (+ 3.07 ml/kg/min, 95% CI 1.93, 4.21; + 0.88 METS, 95% CI 0.55, 1.20), physical function (30-s chair stand: + 2.2 repetitions, 95% CI 1.3, 3.1), muscular endurance (10-repetition maximum: chest press + 4.1 kg, 95% CI 2.0, 6.3; lateral pulldown + 6.6 kg, 95% CI 4.4, 8.9), self-reported fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue score: + 4.9, 95% CI 1.6, 8.1), and QoL (FACT-G7 score + 2.1, 95% CI, 0.9, 3.4). Among stage IV rural and urban cancer survivors, significant improvements were observed in muscular endurance and physical function. CONCLUSION: Participation in POWER was associated with attenuation of cancer treatment–related side effects and may serve as a model exercise oncology program for rural cancer survivors.","Coletta, Adriana M.; Rose, Nathan B.; Johnson, Austin F.; Moxon, D.

MAIN BODY: Several novel clinical data have shown a relationship between the vaccinated population with the bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine and the severity and mortality rate from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the linkage between the BCG vaccine and COVID-19 infection mortality and morbidity rate is still ambiguous. The BCG has been protected previously from many other respiratory viral infections. The efficacy of the BCG vaccine in the protection against COVID-19 depends on various factors including social, economic, cultural norms, mitigation efforts, health infrastructure, and demographic differences between countries. CONCLUSION: Thus, the literature analyses show a noticed difference between the countries that follow national vaccination programs than in countries that do not follow such programs (Italy, Netherlands, USA). However, there are not any recommendations for using BCG in the protection against severe cases of COVID-19. The severity of COVID-19 maybe depends on the age, immune state of the patient, and the level of vaccine coverage. The possible reason for BCG protection is trained immunity in both diseases.","Marzoog, Basheer Abdullah; Vlasova, Tatyana Ivanovna",Egypt J Bronchol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7838855/,164
45720,Gruppen leiten mit dem Leipziger Prozessorientierungsmodell: Strategische Orientierung in Gruppen- und Einzelarbeitsprozessen,2021-02-12,"Healthcare service is experiencing a paradigm shift due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has caused unprecedented fatalities and taken a toll on medical resources globally. Researchers and healthcare professionals value how data accessibility and analytics can save lives. Developing countries are fast leveraging on the electronic medical record (EMR) system to enhance decision-making effectiveness and patient care. However, for many healthcare professionals, there remain unexplored possibilities of how the use of this ‘normally’ operational-centric EMR might change post-pandemic. We investigate the antecedents (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, habit) of the intention to use EMR, and its impact on dynamic capabilities and physician productivity pre- and post-pandemic, focusing on physicians who are at the frontline of Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in Malaysia. This study evidences two significant findings: (1) before the pandemic in the ‘normal’ condition of EMR use, technology perception has significant indirect impact on physician productivity via the key role of dynamic capabilities. However, (2) after the pandemic in the ‘abnormal’ condition, technology perception no longer has any significant impact on physician productivity though their intention to use EMR may have a very weak direct impact on their productivity. A key significant change in the new norm post-pandemic is that dynamic capabilities no longer mediate but strongly and directly impact physician productivity. This direct positive effect is much stronger than before the pandemic. Theoretically, the study is among the first few to integrate perspectives from information systems and dynamic capabilities to examine the impact of EMR use on physician dynamic capabilities for knowledge acquisition and deployment towards enhancing their productivity. The study also offers insights into how a pandemic could accelerate technology perception and contributes to the dynamic use of technology to aid physicians.","Liew, Ewilly J. Y.; Koh, Sharon G.

Published evidence on virtual group consultations is limited, although interest and front‐line experience have grown substantially since pandemic onset. Unpublished data are summarised showing feasibility of transitioning care to this model across different countries, care settings and conditions. An international webinar series has supported development and sharing of best practice and representative data on spread and utilisation of virtual groups. This model of care creates time and space for more questions and answers, so once engaged patients become staunch advocates. Group care supports personalised care and lifestyle medicine, which is growing very rapidly. In the current context, even healthcare providers under pressure can implement virtual group consultations. Most virtual group consultations have a facilitator, so this allows roles to be extended and support education of both students and new team members. These can confer greater access, continuity of care, peer support and timely information about Covid‐19 and may result in better health outcomes. Given the rapid and widespread implementation of virtual care during this pandemic, data should be shared effectively and methodologically sound observational studies and clinical trials to test safety and effectiveness should be promoted now.","Birrell, Fraser; Lawson, Rob; Sumego, Marianne; Lewis, Jessica; Harden, Angela; Taveira, Tracey; Stevens, John; Manson, Alison; Pepper, Linda; Ickovics, Jeannette",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883187/,164

MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) serve key roles in HS formation. The present study investigated the expression, role and mechanism underlying the effects of miR-497-5p in HS formation. miR-497-5p expression was detected via reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. The association between miR-497-5p and Smad7 was analyzed using TargetScan and luciferase reporter assays. Protein expression levels of extracellular matrix markers were measured via western blotting. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The results suggested that miR-497-5p expression was upregulated in HS tissues and human HS fibroblasts (hHSFs) compared with healthy control skin tissues and CCC-ESF-1 cells, respectively. Smad7 was directly targeted by miR-497-5p, and was downregulated in HS tissues and hHSFs compared with healthy control skin tissues and CCC-ESF-1 cells, respectively. Moreover, Smad7 upregulation significantly inhibited cell viability, decreased extracellular matrix deposition and induced apoptosis in hHSFs compared with the control-plasmid group. Moreover, the results indicated that, compared with the inhibitor control group, miR-497-5p inhibitor inhibited cell viability, decreased extracellular matrix deposition and induced apoptosis in hHSFs, which were significantly reversed by Smad7 knockdown. In conclusion, the results indicated that miR-497-5p downregulation repressed HS formation by inhibiting extracellular matrix deposition and hHSF proliferation at least partly by targeting Smad7.","Li, Zhiqiang; Wang, Pengtao; Zhang, Jie; Zhao, Dongkui",Exp Ther Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7918061/,164

To this end, we extend the now-traditional Diebold-Yilmaz spillover index to the quantiles domain by building networks of generalized forecast error variance decomposition of a quantile vector autoregressive model specifically for extreme returns. Notably, we control for common movements by using the overall stock market index as a common factor for all sectors and uncover the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on the dynamics of the network. The results show that the network structure and spillovers differ considerably with respect to the market state. During stable times, the network shows a nice sectoral clustering structure which, however, changes dramatically for both adverse and beneficial market conditions constituting a highly connected network structure. The pandemic period itself shows an interesting restructuring of the network as the dominant clusters become more tightly connected while the rest of the network remains well separated. The sectoral topology thus has not collapsed into a unified market during the pandemic.","Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain; Bouri, Elie; Kristoufek, Ladislav; Saeed, Tareq",Financ Innov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7920753/,164

Nation-states are not equipped to deal with planetary systemic problems and national sovereignty will increasingly be ceded to planetary organizations. This chapter summarizes the key humanitarian challenges of the constellation of KSI nations, as they inexorably converge and forge a planetary system. Humankind faces a range of existential threats, including environmental, pandemic, technological, and war conflicts that necessitate a planetary systems approach. Moreover, there are 20 probable hot zones of war conflict that require the urgent international need for preventive measures for a more just and peaceful world. Cogent transformational leadership seeks to overcome systemic challenges effectively, efficiently, and ethically. In evoking the possible contours of the future landscape, this chapter underscores the cogent and ethical leadership values that will transform an emerging planetary society towards the end of the twenty-first century. Finally, the chapter posits that planetary transformational leaders, or “ Planetarians”, will transcend national paradigms and form the foundations and shape of future planetary systems. Planetary systems will not be a panacea, but will allow for collaborative, humane, and rational approaches to human and technological development and foster greater planetary harmony, justice, and peace.","Caro, Denis H.

Structural Equation Modeling was employed and the findings confirm the positive influence of all the core determinants except for hedonic motivation. This implies that in order to improve the weak penetration of e-commerce in the population, campaigns have to be designed and implemented to make the women entrepreneurs perceive that investment in ICT for e-commerce will be valuable for them and that they can easily use the technology.","Dutta, Sraboni; Shivani, Shradha",Re-imagining Diffusion and Adoption of Information Technology and Systems: A Continuing Conversation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980874/,164

Based on our findings, the Covid‐19 pandemic has indeed significantly changed the determinants of the euro to dollar exchange rate. Also, to investigate the potential shifts in the regimes of the euro to dollar exchange rate, we formulate a Markov‐switching model with two regimes, based on the determinants that have been found in the previous step. Based on our findings, the duration of the high volatility state in the Covid‐19 era has doubled, from almost 3 to approximately 6 days, compared to the pre‐Covid‐19 era, whereas the high volatility state in the Covid‐19 era is characterized by a statistically significant higher range of volatility compared to the pre‐Covid‐19 era.","Konstantakis, Konstantinos N.; Melissaropoulos, Ioannis G.; Daglis, Theodoros; Michaelides, Panayotis G.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8014208/,164

OBJECTIVE: I planned to increase the efficiency of human hazard assessment by searching, analyzing, and linking test data on the relationship between key events occurred at each level, which are the biological targets of chemicals in semiconductor manufacturing. RESULTS: It was found that 48 kinds of chemicals had 11 AOPs, while 103 chemicals had multiple AOPs, and 26 had case evidence. As a result of AOP analysis, it was found that a total of 320 chemicals had 42 AOPs, and 190 major chemicals corresponded to 11 AOPs. It was found necessary to develop a complex AOP and secure an (inhalation or dermal) exposure scenario for combined exposure at work. As a comparative search (41 out of 190 chemicals) of biomarkers specific to occupational diseases, 12 biomarkers were found to be related to breast cancer. The AOPs for 50 specific chemicals were presented, together with occupational disease-specific AOPs and key events relationship from 50 chemicals, and taxonomic classification for each AOP analysis could be found. With a comparative search, 41 out of 190 chemicals were associated with specific biomarkers for occupational diseases, and 12 mRNA or protein biomarkers were found to be related to breast cancer by cross-validation with the attached Table 24 of the Enforcement Regulations of the OSHAct and the CTD. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of occupational diseases caused by chemicals was presented, together with pathological preventions.

Some companies are inventing new business models based on disruptive innovation supported by information technology. Others adapt these business models as followers. All these new business processes and underlying information technology need to be managed, serviced, and supported by IT organizations to ensure business continuity. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic in the year 2020, companies and organisations have been challenged with the fact that workers had to stay and work at home while trying to keep the operations running. This led in some companies to a digitization boost in terms of remote working, which needed new IT-Infrastructure and the adoption of business processes to function from outside the company property. In the current research, job advertisements have been analysed to investigate if the Covid-19 crisis had an impact on the focus and priorities of IT department heads. The initial assumption this research is based on is, that the content of new job openings posted on recruiting webpages in Germany would change through the influence of COVID-19. The research method was a structured content analysis of job offerings looking for IT top management positions in Germany. Data was collected at two different times in the year 2020 to reflect differences before and within the pandemic crisis. After comparing the coded keywords in both datasets no significant change in requirements of tasks or structure of the job ads can be seen in the analysis. Which leads to the conclusion that recruiting departments within companies do not really collect requirements for top management IT positions through alignment with the business.

54183,Positive Lebenszeichen für KI im europäischen Gesundheitswesen,2021-06-11,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the nutrition behaviors of people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A 34-item open- and closed-ended online questionnaire that explores the nutrition behaviors before and during COVID-19 was distributed through PD community and support groups nationwide between September 17-December 28, 2020. To check for differences in variables before and during COVID-19, paired-sample t-tests were used and the level of statistical significance was P < 0.05. Responses to an open-ended question around how COVID-19 has impacted nutrition and eating was analyzed for preliminary themes by the lead researcher. RESULTS: Sixty-three PwPD (31 females) completed the survey. The average age of participants was 69.5 ± 7.5 years and average time since diagnosis was 9.7 ± 7.5 years. Self-reported mean body weight before the pandemic and during the pandemic decreased significantly (78.8 ± 18.7 vs. 77.6 ± 16.6 kg, P = 0.036). The majority of participants reported no change in the following nutrition behaviors: appetite (69.4%), fruit intake (71%), and vegetable consumption (72.6%). While 52.5% of participants reported the amount eaten daily stayed the same, 24.6% of participants reported a total/slight decrease in the amount eaten daily, and 22.9% reported a total/slight increase in the amount eaten daily. Just under 16% of participants reported difficulties with getting the food that they preferred during COVID-19. Since COVID-19, 63.9% of participants reported no change in satisfaction with eating habits, while 27.9% of participants reported a total/slight decrease in satisfaction. Responses to open-ended questions revealed a two-fold trend; PwPD reported either consuming more home-cooked, healthier foods or an increase in snacking of sweets and “junk” foods. Of 60 PwPD, 40%, agreed or strongly agreed they would follow an online free nutrition program. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to understand if change in weight status is caused by lifestyle or disease progression. Although our data indicates some concern around nutrition, research on physical activity changes during COVID-19 is needed to paint a better picture of how COVID-19 has impacted PwPD's health-related lifestyle choices.

54406,Inhalative Steroide senken ACE-2-Genexpression auf dem Bronchialepithel,2021-06-25,"BACKGROUND: During the early COVID-19 pandemic, the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) developed a risk stratification grid to inform the United Kingdom (UK) government regarding strict social isolation, termed “shielding”. This advised inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients thought to be most clinically vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe COVID-19 outcomes, to stay at home and minimize face to face contact, even with household members. Those considered at highest risk included recent commencement of combination biologic and immunomodulator therapy, prednisolone ≥20mg/day, presence of comorbidities, age ≥70 years or clinically active disease in those receiving immunosuppression. Mesalazine was not considered to increase risk. An acknowledged limitation was an absence of COVID-19 risk data. This study sought to identify patient or IBD medication-related factors associated with severe outcomes from COVID-19. METHODS: PREPARE-IBD was a multi-centre observational United Kingdom (UK) cohort study including adult IBD patients (≥18 years) diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR between 1(st) March 2020 and 31(st) August 2020. The primary outcome was severe COVID-19 defined as requirement for intensive care admission, invasive ventilation or death. We tested associations of severe outcomes with medications and other covariates using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: 211 patients were included from 60 UK centres. 56 of 211 patients (26.5%) met the primary outcome. Severe COVID-19 was more common in ulcerative colitis relative to Crohn’s disease patients (33.9% [37/109] vs. 18.6% [16/86], p=0.018). Shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting were more common with severe COVID-19 (p<0.001 and p=0.023 respectively). Multivariable analysis identified co-morbidities and age as associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes; odds ratio (OR [95% CI]) 1.68 (1.23-2.35) for each co-morbidity, and an OR 1.03 (1.00-1.05) with each successive year of age. Neither clinically active IBD (OR 0.58 [0.26-1.26]), non-white ethnicity (OR 1.98 [0.92-4.28]), nor prednisolone use (OR 2.42 [0.47-11.26]) were associated with increased risk. On multivariable analysis, mesalazine was associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes (OR 2.03 [1.01-4.12]). Univariable analysis identified biologics and thiopurines as protective (OR 0.38 [0.15-0.87] and 0.32 [0.092-0.86] respectively). On multivariable analysis no association of severe COVID-19 outcomes with thiopurine or biologic exposure was seen. CONCLUSION: Our data provide reassurance for the continued evidence-based use of corticosteroids, immunomodulators and biologic therapies in IBD during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and is consistent with an as yet unexplained association between mesalazine use and severe COVID-19 outcomes.","Lamb, C A; Sebastian, S; Kent, A J; Segal, J P; Gonzalez, H A; Brookes, M J; Mehta, S J; Subramanian, S; Bhala, N; Hicks, L C; Conley, T E; Patel, K V; Walker, G J; Kennedy, N A",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194847/,164

These simulators must include the simulation of actuators and sensors, the ability to simulate robots and their environment. During this systematic review of the literature, 559 articles were extracted from six different databases using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, Context (PICOC) method. After the selection process, 50 selected articles were included in this review. Several simulators were found and their features were also analyzed. As a result of this process, four realistic simulators were applied in the review’s referred context for two main reasons. The first reason is that these simulators have high fidelity in the robots’ visual modeling due to the 3D rendering engines and the second reason is because they apply physics engines, allowing the robot’s interaction with the environment.","Camargo, Caio; Gonçalves, José; Conde, Miguel Á.; Rodríguez-Sedano, Francisco J.; Costa, Paulo; García-Peñalvo, Francisco J.",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8230607/,164
55221,Impfungen gehören zur Personalhygiene,2021-07-07,"The SARS‐CoV‐2 virus is responsible for the COVID‐19 pandemic which continues to impact nearly every person on Earth, having caused over 1.8 million deaths. Two anti‐SARS‐CoV monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 80R and 362 are known to bind to epitopes on the spike protein receptor‐binding domain (RBD) and neutralize the virus. To investigate this further and hypothesize structures for potentially more effective antibodies, undergraduate students cooperated in teams as part of the CREST (Connecting Researchers, Educators, and STudents) Program with the Center for Biological Modeling. Working collaboratively, students from eight universities nationwide applied their knowledge to build 3‐D printed models to explain a particular protein‐based molecular story using crystal structures of proteins described in the literature. The Nova Southeastern University (NSU) CREST team modeled and compared the 80R antibody that binds to SARS‐CoV‐1 and the MAb362 antibody that can bind to both SARS‐CoV‐1 and SARS‐CoV‐2. Students developed skills with protein visualization software including Pymol and Jmol to design models which showed the 80R and 362 antibodies binding to the RBD of the corresponding proteins. By studying the point mutation differences between the two antibodies (80R and 362), a potentially more universal antibody (named NSU1 in this study) was modeled. This hypothesized antibody was expected to bind more effectively to future mutations in the SARS spike protein. At the binding interface between these antibodies and the SARS spike protein, MAb362 mutations trend smaller and less polar including: Arg149Ser, Asn151Ser, Asp170Gly, and Trp213Ser. Due to the trend of smaller amino acids appearing in the MAb362 binding interface, it was hypothesized that more space in this area could allow antibodies to be more resistant to future SARS‐CoV spike protein structure variations. NSU1 was modeled based on MAb362 with the following four additional mutations: Asp103Gly, Trp104Leu, Gly170Ser, and Arg211Val. All of these except for Gly170 are mutations that decreased size and polarity of amino acid residues within the binding interface. Position 170 is Asp on the 80R structure and thus a mutation to Ser is still expected to maintain this trend of smaller residues in the antibody. Due to the additional space created due to these amino acid substitutions in the binding region between the antibody and RBD of the spike protein, NSU1 was predicted to be more resistant to spike protein mutations. These models allowed for deeper understanding of the impact that mutations in antibodies can have on binding interactions with viral proteins. Additionally, the modeling process also provided insight into the molecular structure of a potentially more universal antibody against variations in SARS‐CoV.","Manikkuttiyil, Carol; Abbas, Feza; Abbas, Lyla; Alzamora, Carolina; Hunt, Matthew; Julakanti, Pujita; Likki, Sanjana; Manikkuttiyil, Christo; Schmitt Lavin, Emily; Sikora, Arthur",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239646/,164
55232,Auswertung von SAE-Level-3-Fahrfunktionen auf europäischen Straßen,2021-07-01,"Interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) is a pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine that plays a pivotal role in the activation and regulation of proper immune response during respiratory viral infections. Aberrant IL‐6 expression, however, may promote virus survival and/or exacerbation of clinical symptoms, such as the inflammatory cytokine storms observed in severe COVID‐19 patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. IL‐6 is now regarded as a prominent target for clinical intervention but less is known about how IL‐6 itself is regulated in various disorders. Using precision nuclear run‐on next generation sequencing (PRO‐Seq) to measure the transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerases (RNA Pol II) in human primary small airway epithelial cells (hSAECs), we have discovered an upstream enhancer‐like region in the IL‐6 gene locus. This is a region that resides within an open chromatin domain. It has DNase I hypersensitivity and enriches in activating H3K27Ac mark, but lack of active transcription mark H3K36me3. Interestingly, it displays increased ratio of H3K4me1 over H3K4me3, a phenomenon usually associated with active enhancers. We were therefore surprised to observe that rhinovirus (RV) infection disrupts active RNA Pol II binding in this region, despite the fact that RNA Pol II is increased in the body of the IL‐6 gene. These findings suggest that the upstream sequence may be functioning as a suppressor of IL‐6 expression. To test this possibility, we targeted the KRAB transcriptional silencer to the upstream sequence using CRISPRi (KRAB/dCas9 directed by sgRNA). hSAECs expressing control sgRNA or the sequence‐specific sgRNA were infected with RV and IL‐6 mRNA measured by Q‐RT‐PCR. Intriguingly, the sequence‐specific sgRNA enhanced RV‐ induced IL‐6 expression. These results suggest that the upstream element is not an enhancer but a functionally active suppressor of IL‐6 expression and that the mechanism of IL‐6 expression involves a previously unknown de‐repression step. It will advance us to understand how dynamic interactions between cis‐regulatory elements regulate the threshold, magnitude and duration of IL‐6 gene transcription in response to distinct factors.","Yang, Jun; Brasier, Allan; Zhang, Yueqing",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239674/,164

55824,New Potential for Plug-in Hybrids,2021-07-16,"INTRODUCTION: Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects a significant portion of the United States population and causes negative psychological burdens that affects men and their partner's quality of life and satisfaction. Extracorporeal shock therapy (ESWT) utilizing focused ESWT and radial ESWT in Low-intensity shock wave therapy has been used to treat ED with some success. Wharton's Jelly (WJ) is a biologic substance with large amounts of stem cells, growth factors, cytokines and extracellular components. The use of combined focused and radial ESWT (DualStim therapy) with injected WJ have potential uses in ED that may have advantages over current treatments. MATERIALS: A randomized, single-blinded, controlled clinical trial will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DualStim therapy and intracavernosal injection of WJ in moderate to severe ED. A total of 60 patients with moderate to severe ED will be enrolled and treated with DualStim therapy with intracavernosal injection of WJ or saline for a period of 7 weeks. The International Index of Erectile Function – Erectile Function score will be used to gauge the treatment related changes in relation to the subject's baseline. The scores will be recorded at baseline and compared to follow-ups 1,3 and 6 months post-treatment. Any adverse events or severe adverse events will be recorded in the corresponding case report forms. Sexual Encounter Profile, as well as the Global Assessment Questionnaire and the Erection Hardness Score will be used to determine the sexual activity improvement from baseline leading to optimal penetration at follow-ups 1,3 and 6 months post-treatment. DISCUSSION: This clinical trial is one of the first studies to determine the immediate and short-term efficacy of DualStim therapy, with and without intracavernosal injection of formulated umbilical cord-derived WJ to improve and/or restore erectile function in patients with moderate to severe ED. This study will also provide insight into the safety and efficacy of WJ. We anticipate clinically significant improvement in patients suffering from moderate and severe ED treated with DualStim therapy with WJ compared to their baseline and DualStim with saline.","Gupta, Ashim; Rodriguez, Hugo C.; Delfino, Kristin; Levy, Howard J.; El-Amin, Saadiq F.; Gaines, Richard",Contemp Clin Trials Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8267434/,164

56671,Recht,2021-08-17,"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. BACKGROUND: Reportedly, hypertension (HTN) independently increases the risk of Covid-19 severity and doubles the risk of Covid-19 mortality. Also, individuals with untreated HTN remain at high risk of covid-19 complications in comparison to those managed with antihypertensive treatment. OBJECTIVE: The survey was carried out to seek the opinion of healthcare practitioners (HCPs) on the impact of Covid-19 lockdown on the blood pressure (BP) control, and the role of triple drug therapy in management of uncontrolled BP. METHOD: This PAN India study was carried out through a structured web-based objective questionnaire survey involving 479 HCPs. The survey comprised questions related to the prevalence and causes of uncontrolled BP during the Covid-19 lockdown, and the use of triple drug therapy in the management of uncontrolled BP. RESULTS: The respondent pool of 479 HCPs consisted of consulting physicians (51.5%), family physicians (19%), diabetologists (15%), cardiologists (14%) and nephrologists (0.5%). In this study a majority (40%) of HCPs agreed that stress was the most common reason behind uncontrolled BP during Covid-19 lockdown followed by non-compliance of treatment and sedentary lifestyle, each opined by 30% of HCPs. Almost 54% and 40% of the HCPs respectively, mentioned that 10-40% and 40-80% of their patients with hypertension have reported uncontrolled BP levels following the Covid-19 lockdown. 4% of the HCPs reported that all of their patients lost BP control, while 2% of HCPs mentioned that none of their patients reported uncontrolled BP after the Covid-19 lockdown. Of all the HCPs, 12% opined that they will choose a triple drug combination (TDC) for patients uncontrolled with high dose monotherapy, ∼75% opined that they will chose TDC for patients uncontrolled with dual therapy while 13% mentioned that they will chose TDC for patients at high risk. Regarding the TDC of choice, more than half (51%) of the HCPs opted for Telmisartan + Amlodipine + Hydrochlorothiazide as the preferred combination. Among other TDCs, Telmisartan + Amlodipine + Chlorthalidone, Telmisartan + Cilnidipine + Chlorthalidone, and Olmesartan + Amlodipine + Hydrochlorothiazide were ranked as the next three choices opted by 28%, 17.5% and 2.5% of HCPs for the management of uncontrolled BP. A majority of HCPs (58%) also agreed that they would adopt TDC early in the treatment, during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: This study underlined the negative impact of Covid-19 lockdown on the blood pressure control in patients with hypertension. It also highlighted the HCPs perspectives on the early use of TDC, and that Telmisartan + Amlodipine + Hydrochlorothiazide is the most commonly preferred TDC in patients with uncontrolled BP levels in Indian settings.","Abhyankar, MAHESH; Kumar, SHARAD; Kumar, BK; Swain, SK; Walavalkar, AMAR; Silki, SILKI",Eur J Cardiovasc Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8344440/,164

Study findings draw much needed attention to culturally grounded solutions generated by the community to reduce barriers and increase facilitators of mental health engagement. Building on community-generated solutions and expanding the capacity of local community-based ethnic organisations will be the first step in providing services that are truly responsive to the cultural needs of the Bhutanese refugee population. Recognition of refugee communities’ unique collective strengths will be much needed to holistically collaborate with these new members of the society to promote mental well-being and foster a sense of inclusion and belonging, especially in the post-coronavirus pandemic context.

AIMS: The potential impacts of independent regional planning on the effectiveness of suicide prevention programmes in the Australian state of New South Wales were quantified using a system dynamics model of mental health services provision and suicidal behaviour in each of the state's ten Primary Health Network (PHN) catchments. METHOD: Reductions in projected suicide mortality over the period 2021–2031 were calculated for scenarios in which combinations of four and five suicide prevention and mental health services interventions (selected from 13 possible interventions) are implemented separately in each PHN catchment. State-level impacts were estimated by summing reductions in projected suicide mortality for each intervention combination across PHN catchments. RESULTS: The most effective state-level combinations of four and five interventions prevent, respectively, 20.3% and 22.9% of 10 312 suicides projected under a business-as-usual scenario (i.e. no new policies or programmes, constant services capacity growth). Projected numbers of suicides under the optimal intervention scenarios for each PHN are up to 6% lower than corresponding numbers of suicides projected for the optimal state-level intervention combinations. CONCLUSIONS: Regional suicide prevention planning may contribute to significant reductions in suicide mortality where local health authorities are provided with the necessary resources and tools to support reliable, evidence-based decision-making.","Skinner, Adam; Occhipinti, Jo-An; Song, Yun Ju Christine; Hickie, Ian B.",BJPsych Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8444054/,164

Even before the start of the pandemic, there were significant barriers to access mental health services in Chile, coupled with a scenario of nationwide social unrest and protests that questioned the legitimacy of public institutions; now the rapidly worsening outbreaks of COVID-19 are exacerbating the pre-existing mental health crisis. Methods: We conducted a bibliometric and content analysis of the Chilean mental health public policies implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic and then compared these policies with international experiences and emerging scientific evidence on the mental health impact of pandemics. Results: Our analysis of the policies identifies five crucial points of action developed in Chile: (i) an established framework to address mental health in emergency and disaster situations; (ii) a timely COVID-19 Mental Health Action Plan; (iii) inclusion of mental health in the public health agenda; (iv) development of a presidential strategy during the pandemic for comprehensive mental health and well-being; and (v) emerging research assessing the mental health implications of COVID-19. Conclusions: In Chile, the public policy responses to address the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by the coordinated implementation of mental health plans, ranging from a health sectoral initiative to inter-agency and intersectoral efforts. However, it is imperative that increased funding is allocated to mental health, and efforts should be made to promote the participation of people with lived experiences and communities in the design and implementation of the proposed actions.

59712,Six ways to juggle science and childcare from home.,2020-04-09,"Background - Left bundle branch pacing (LBBP) is a novel pacing method and has been observed to have low and stable pacing thresholds in prior small short-term studies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of LBBP in a large consecutive diverse group of patients with long-term follow up. Methods - This study prospectively enrolled 632 consecutive pacemaker patients with attempted LBBP from April 2017 to July 2019. Pacing parameters, complications, ECG, and echocardiographic measurements were assessed at implant, and during follow-up of 1, 6, 12 and 24 months. Results - LBBP was successful in 618/632 (97.8%) patients according to strict criteria for LBB capture. Mean follow-up time was 18.6±6.7 months. 231 patients had follow-up over 2 years. LBB capture threshold at implant was 0.65±0.27 mV@0.5ms and 0.69±0.24 mV@0.5ms at 2-year follow-up. A significant decrease in QRS duration was observed in patients with LBBB (167.22 ± 18.99ms vs. 124.02 ± 24.15ms, p<0.001). Post implantation left ventricular ejection fraction improved in patients with QRS≥120ms (48.82±17.78 % vs. 58.12±13.04 %, p<0.001). The number of patients with moderate and severe tricuspid regurgitation decreased at 1-year. Permanent right bundle branch injury occurred in 55 (8.9%) patients. LBB capture threshold increased to more than 3 V or loss of bundle capture in 6 patients (1%), 2 patients of them had loss of conduction system capture. Two patients required lead revision due to dislodgement. Conclusions - This large observational study suggests that LBBP is feasible with high success rates and low complication rates during long term follow up. Therefore, LBBP appears to be a reliable method for physiological pacing for patients with either a bradycardia or heart failure pacing indication.","Su, Lan; Wang, Songjie; Wu, Shengjie; Xu, Lei; Huang, Zhouqing; Chen, Xiao; Zheng, Rujie; Jiang, Limeng; Ellenbogen, Kenneth A; Whinnett, Zachary I; Huang, Weijian",Circulation.

59745,Coronavirus: Lombardy lessons for policy and governance.,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND Tremendous advances have occurred in therapies for peripheral vascular disease (PVD); until recently, however, it has not been possible to examine the entire clinical trial portfolio of studies for the treatment of PVD (both arterial and venous disease). METHODS AND RESULTS We examined interventional trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov from October 2007 through September 2010 (n=40,970) and identified 676 (1.7%) PVD trials (n=493 arterial only, n=170 venous only, n=13 both arterial and venous). Most arterial studies investigated lower-extremity peripheral artery disease and acute stroke (35% and 24%, respectively), whereas most venous studies examined deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolus prevention (42%) or venous ulceration (25%). A placebo-controlled trial design was used in 27% of the PVD trials, and 4% of the PVD trials excluded patients >65 years of age. Enrollment in at least 1 US site decreased from 51% of trials in 2007 to 41% in 2010. Compared with noncardiology disciplines, PVD trials were more likely to be double-blinded, to investigate the use of devices and procedures, and to have industry sponsorship and assumed funding source, and they were less likely to investigate drug and behavioral therapies. Geographic access to PVD clinical trials within the United States is limited to primarily large metropolitan areas. CONCLUSIONS PVD studies represent a small group of trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, despite the high prevalence of vascular disease in the general population. This low number, compounded by the decreasing number of PVD trials in the United States, is concerning and may limit the ability to inform current clinical practice of patients with PVD.","Subherwal, Sumeet; Patel, Manesh R; Chiswell, Karen; Tidemann-Miller, Beth A; Jones, W Schuyler; Conte, Michael S; White, Christopher J; Bhatt, Deepak L; Laird, John R; Hiatt, William R; Tasneem, Asba; Califf, Robert M",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.114.011021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25239436/,164

Despite the milestones that NATs have made in clinical translation over the past decade, one important challenge pertains to increasing the specificity of this class of drugs. Activating NATs exclusively in disease-causing cells is highly desirable because it will safely broaden the application of NATs to a wider range of clinical indications. Smart NATs are triggered through a photo-uncaging reaction or a specific molecular input such as a transcript, protein, or small molecule, thus complementing the current strategy of targeting cells and tissues with receptor-specific ligands to enhance specificity. This review summarizes the programmable modalities that have been incorporated into NATs to build in responsive behaviors. We discuss the various inputs, transduction mechanisms, and output response functions that have been demonstrated to date.","Zhang, Jiahui; Salaita, Khalid",Trends in biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2021.03.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33980422/,164

METHODS State-transition Markov model provided absolute and incremental clinical and monetary results. In the model, obese patients could undergo surgery, develop post-surgery complications, experience diabetes type II, cardiovascular diseases or die. German Quality Assurance in Bariatric Surgery Registry and literature sources provided data on clinical effectiveness and safety. The model considered three types of surgeries: gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and adjustable gastric banding. The model was extensively validated, and deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate uncertainty. Cost data were obtained from German sources and presented in 2012 euros (€). RESULTS Over 10 years, bariatric surgery led to the incremental cost of €2909, generated additional 0.03 years of life and 1.2 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Bariatric surgery was cost-effective at 10 years with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €2457 per QALY. Over a lifetime, surgery led to savings of €8522 and generated an increment of 0.7 years of life or 3.2 QALYs. The analysis also depicted an association between surgery and a reduction of obesity-related adverse events (diabetes, cardiovascular disorders). Delaying surgery for up to 3 years, resulted in a reduction of life years and QALYs gained, in addition to a moderate reduction in associated healthcare costs. CONCLUSIONS Bariatric surgery is cost-effective at 10 years post-surgery and may result in a substantial reduction in the financial burden on the healthcare system over the lifetime of the treated individuals. It is also observed that delays in the provision of surgery may lead to a significant loss of clinical benefits.","Borisenko, Oleg; Mann, Oliver; Duprée, Anna",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12893-017-0284-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28774333/,164
61613,Protect precious scientific collaboration from geopolitics.,2021-05-01,"The increasing use of raw carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs) will inevitably affect wastewater treatment systems. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are ecological wastewater treatment facilities and can intercept the vast particles pollutant, including CBNs. However, the impacts of CBNs on the treatment performance of CWs have no available knowledge. Therefore, we systematically inspected the effects of single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs and MWCNTs) and fullerene nanoparticles (C60) on CW performance under 180-day exposure to 0, 10 and 1000 μg/L concentrations. The results showed that CBNs had marginally adverse impacts on chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total phosphorus (TP) removal, whereas nitrogen removal declined by 24.1 %-42.7 % following long-term exposure to CBNs. MWCNTs had the greatest inhibition effect on nitrogen removal, followed by SWCNTs and C60. The CBNs also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction as the increasing concentration, which confirmed that CBNs have biotoxic effects in CWs. The variation of functional microbial community and the inhibition of enzyme activities were the dominant reasons for the decline in nitrogen removal efficiency. Furthermore, predictive functional profiling showed that CBNs affected functional gene abundance, and caused a decline in the enzymes abundance connected to nitrogen removal by the end of the 180-day exposure period.","Yang, Xiangyu; He, Qiang; Guo, Fucheng; Sun, Xiaohui; Zhang, Junmao; Chen, Yi",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645543/,164
62712,COVID vaccines and safety: what the research says.,2021-02-16,"Obesity is highly prevalent worldwide, including among people with chronic kidney disease. The presence of severe and/or end-stage kidney disease, complicates the treatment of obesity for several reasons, including restrictions on protein and fluid intake and renal excretion of several medications indicated for the treatment of obesity. The aim of this review is to assess the safety of intensive obesity treatments, such as very-low-energy diets (VLEDs), obesity pharmacotherapy and/or bariatric surgery, in people with end-stage kidney disease. A literature search was conducted to identify studies reporting safety outcomes for very-low-energy diets, liraglutide, phentermine, phentermine-topiramate, naltrexone-bupropion and bariatric surgery in people with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2 or on dialysis. Limited data was insufficient to recommend VLEDs but highlighted their potential efficacy and the need for close clinical and biochemical monitoring. There was no data regarding centrally-acting obesity pharmacotherapy in this population, although some GLP-1 analogues appear to safely induce weight loss at doses used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Some studies suggest an increased rate of complications of bariatric surgery in individuals with severe or end-stage CKD. Further prospective evaluation of intensive obesity management in the growing population with obesity and severe, end-stage and dialysis-dependent CKD is required.

To assess the current state of Medical Mycology support in Germany, we conducted a survey among all 36 academic medical centers. METHODS The survey consisted of a 3-pages questionnaire sent out in the first half of 2019. Information included details of infrastructure, education and teaching; consultation services and interdisciplinary conferences; research activities and participation in network groups; radiology, microbiology and pharmacology support; publication activity; and European Confederation for Medical Mycology (ECMM) Excellence Center designation, if assigned. RESULTS Information was returned from 24 centers (67%). Thirteen institutions (54%) reported an independent Infectious Disease, and two a separate Medical Mycology department (8%); a Medical Mycology working group was reported for nine institutions (38%). An Infectious Disease consultation service was existent in 16 institutions (67%) and a multidisciplinary conference in 13 (54%). Fifteen institutions reported a separate study office with activities in Infectious Disease studies (63%). Laboratory capability for fungal identification and susceptibility testing was confirmed by all 24 institutions; testing of galactomannan by 23 (96%), cryptococcal antigen by 21 (88%), ß-D-Glucan by 9 (38%), and pan-fungal and Pneumocystis PCR by 21 and 22 (88 and 92%), respectively. Therapeutic drug monitoring of voriconazole was reported to be available in 15 (63%) institutions with a turn-around of ≤24 hours during weekdays in 10 (42%).

63491,How swamped preprint servers are blocking bad coronavirus research.,2020-05-07,"BACKGROUND Animal models are often used to assess interventions that might improve fat grafting outcomes; however, there is great variability in the models. The authors sought to determine the predictive value of the immunocompromised mouse model for fat grafting so that experiments could be standardized and optimized. METHODS Human lipoaspirate injections at different volumes and time points were assessed in a nude mouse model and compared with control injections of nonviable fat. Volume retention and explant histologic score were compared. In a separate study, interanimal reproducibility was determined by implanting a highly consistent hydrogel and measuring variability in volume retention. RESULTS Injection volume significantly affects adipose resorption kinetics at 6 and 12 weeks. Masson trichrome staining revealed that macrophages were unable to infiltrate large (1 ml) grafts, and oil cysts were not absorbed by 18 weeks, which interfered with interpretation of volume retention data. Nonviable tissue was resorbed when grafts were 0.3 ml, and quantification of graft histologic viability correlated well with graft retention at all study time points. Interanimal variability was measured to be 8.44 percent of the mean retention volume for small graft volumes. CONCLUSIONS Human fat graft retention in the immunodeficient mouse correlates with graft viability in small, 0.3-ml-volume grafts. However, centralized oil cysts in nonviable 1.0-ml grafts were not resorbed by 18 weeks and thus volume measurements were confounded and not significantly different from viable samples. In addition, tissue injury scores increased in initially healthy fat grafts at 18 weeks, possibly because of a delayed immune reaction.","Kokai, Lauren E; Jones, Taraneh L; Silowash, Russell; Theisen, Brian; DiBernardo, Gabriella; Lu, Andrew; Yi, Bowen; Marra, Kacey G; Rubin, J Peter",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0000000000003868; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28806292/,164

These changes will affect how radiology is taught to medical students at both the pre-clerkship (ie, year 1 and 2) and clinical (ie, year 3 and 4) levels. In the pre-clerkship learning environment, medical students are typically exposed to radiology through didactic lectures, integrated anatomy laboratories, case-based learning, and ultrasound clinical skills sessions. In the clinical learning environment, medical students primarily shadow radiologists and radiology residents and attend radiology resident teaching sessions.

In a world where hierarchical teaching and learning has dominated for decades, this concept has been refreshing. I have seen the benefits first-hand, having participated in a 2-week student-staff collaboration to redesign the year-one medical curriculum at the Imperial College School of Medicine. However, inherent to such partnerships can be imbalanced power dynamics, which may pose a barrier and prevent the project from achieving its potential. The sources and impacts of these power dynamics are complex and the solutions multi-faceted. In our project, these imbalances of power were mitigated because the correct steps were taken both by the educators, as well as by the organisation. We produced outputs that led to significant change in the curriculum, in the short space of 2 weeks. I attribute this largely to the careful management of power dynamics throughout.

Multivariate linear regression was used to determine factors associated with glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) . A1C was clinically elevated ≥8% for 60.3% of the participants. Overall, age and PA levels showed a negative association with A1C, and positively with underweight status, duration of diabetes, and participants' view of fluctuating/unstable blood glucose and blood glucose not improved compared to first diagnosed. A significant negative association with A1C was shown with PA levels and additional blood glucose monitoring (BGM) beyond that received at the public clinic in the urban area. Whilst, in the semi-urban area, there was a significant positive association with A1C with regards to duration of diabetes and insulin regimen. Determinants of A1C in this target group are multifactorial, therefore, interventions aiming to improve diabetes clinical outcomes are needed to reduce the likelihood of serious ramifications.

METHODS This is a prospective study of patients operated with RAL between December 2016 and September 2018. Patients with Wilms tumors were treated according to the SIOP-2001 protocol. Patient and tumor characteristics, type of surgery, surgical-related morbidity, and oncologic outcomes were recorded. Results were compared with a series of patients with similar age- and tumor-related characteristics operated during the same period by an open surgical approach. RESULTS Ten children underwent RAL nephrectomy with a mean age of five years (3.2-14.1 years). Total nephrectomy was done in six cases for Wilms tumor and in one case for renal sarcoma; three cases were converted. Complete removal of tumor without rupture was achieved in all cases. Postoperative course was uneventful, and patients were discharged between days 2 and 7. Neither recurrence nor medium-term complications occurred. Nine patients are alive with a median follow-up of 16 months (6-27 months) and one female died from complications of central nervous system metastases one year after surgery. When compared with the open surgical approach group, median tumor volume was smaller (P = 0.005), hospital stay was shorter (P = 0.01), and operative time was similar (P = 0.20).

Yet what EEID researchers mean by the term ""model systems"" and what they want from them is unclear. This uncertainty hinders our ability to maximally exploit these systems, identify knowledge gaps, and establish effective new model systems. Here, we borrow a definition of model systems from the biomolecular sciences to assess how EEID researchers are (and are not) using 10 key model systems. According to this definition, model systems in EEID are not being used to their fullest and, in fact, cannot even be considered model systems. Research using these systems consistently addresses only two of the three fundamental processes that underlie disease dynamics-transmission and disease, but not recovery. Furthermore, studies tend to focus on only a few scales of biological organization that matter for disease ecology and evolution. Moreover, the field lacks an infrastructure to perform comparative analyses. We aim to begin a discussion of what we want from model systems, which would further progress toward a thorough, holistic understanding of EEID.","Wale, Nina; Duffy, Meghan A",The American naturalist,https://doi.org/10.1086/714595; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34143716/,164
70252,My Lived Experience As an Epidemiologist in 2020.,2020-10-27,"INTRODUCTION While the efficacy and guidelines for implementation of rapid response systems are well established, limited information exists about rapid response paradigms for paediatric cardiac patients despite their unique pathophysiology. METHODS With endorsement from the Paediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society, we designed and implemented a web-based survey of paediatric cardiac and multidisciplinary ICU medical directors in the United States of America and Canada to better understand paediatric cardiac rapid response practices. RESULTS Sixty-five (52%) of 125 centres responded. Seventy-one per cent of centres had ∼300 non-ICU beds and 71% had dedicated cardiac ICUs. To respond to cardiac patients, dedicated cardiac rapid response teams were utilised in 29% of all centres (39% and 5% in centres with and without dedicated cardiac ICUs, respectively) [p = 0.006]. Early warning scores were utilised in 62% of centres. Only 31% reported that rapid response teams received specialised training. Transfers to ICU were higher for cardiac (73%) compared to generalised rapid response events (54%). The monitoring and reassessment of patients not transferred to ICU after the rapid response was variable. Cardiac and respiratory arrests outside the ICU were infrequent. Only 29% of centres formally appraise critical deterioration events (need for ventilation and/or inotropes post-rapid response) and 34% perform post-event debriefs. CONCLUSION Paediatric cardiac rapid response practices are variable and dedicated paediatric cardiac rapid response systems are infrequent in the United States of America and Canada. Opportunity exists to delineate best practices for paediatric cardiac rapid response and standardise practices for activation, training, patient monitoring post-rapid response events, and outcomes evaluation.","Bavare, Aarti C; Afonso, Natasha S; Sembera, Kerry A; Buckley, Jason R; Raymond, Tia T; McKeta, Angela; Costello, John M",Cardiology in the young,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1047951121003322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407898/,164

Although LCMV-induced meningitis and encephalitis have been studied extensively, the immunopathological mechanisms underlying LCMV infection-associated ocular disease remain elusive. We report here that the intraocular administration of the neurotropic LCMV strain Armstrong (Arm) elicited pronounced chorioretinitis and keratitis and that infection with the more viscerotropic strains WE and Docile precipitated less severe immunopathological ocular disease. Time course analyses revealed that LCMV Arm infection of the uvea and neuroretina led to monophasic chorioretinitis which peaked between days 7 and 12 after infection. Analyses of T-cell-deficient mouse strains showed that LCMV-mediated ocular disease was strictly dependent on the presence of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells and that the contribution of CD4(+) T cells was negligible. Whereas the topical application of immunosuppressive agents did not prevent the development of chorioretinitis, passive immunization with hyperimmune sera partially prevented retinal and corneal damage. Likewise, mice displaying preexisting LCMV-specific T-cell responses were protected against LCMV-induced ocular disease. Thus, antibody- and/or T-cell-based vaccination protocols could be employed as preventive strategies against LCMV-mediated chorioretinitis.","Zinkernagel, Martin S; Bolinger, Beatrice; Krebs, Philippe; Onder, Lucas; Miller, Simone; Ludewig, Burkhard",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01211-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18945766/,164
72955,Sharp U-Net: Depthwise convolutional network for biomedical image segmentation.,2021-07-29,"STUDY OBJECTIVE The COVID-19 crisis has severely stressed our healthcare system and pushed our economy to the brink. This long emergency will probably cause years of severe suffering in every region. Health expenses greatly increased, supply chains were disrupted, and governments coped with much less revenue. Good clinicians plan for ALL contingencies, and we need to consider that the current disaster may get much worse. How can we adapt psychiatry to a long emergency? This goes far beyond previous work on crisis standards of care because the emergency is severe, prolonged, and widespread. If we had to spend much less on psychotropics, which meds stay on the formulary? If we have to close hospitals, which patients get a bed? What adaptations could be used if demand exceeds the supply of providers? Very little is known about how to make severe, permanent cuts to healthcare. Our previous systematic review found no scholarship addressing the ethics of severe and prolonged healthcare rationing. Global catastrophes need a global health policy, but this one has no experts. The present study starts the project by surveying experts with related experience that could be useful in future plans. METHOD We used purposive sampling to find 18 professionals with experience in healthcare rationing from underserved, indigenous communities, homeless programs, and African nations. We also interviewed ethicists, pharmacists, administrators, NGO clinicians, and military. Interviews were transcribed and coded using basic inductive techniques. Because so little is known about this topic, we used grounded theory, an iterative approach to guide further sampling, refine interviews, and make some preliminary conclusions. RESULTS Participants all agreed this crisis planning is extremely important and complex. They described diverse concerns regarding ethical decision making, with some having confidence with top-down government policy, and others recommending a grassroots approach. Minority participants had less confidence in government. There was no consensus on any best ethical framework. Most had confidence that clinicians will ultimately do the right thing. Native American leaders had confidence in a holistic, preventive approach. All agreed that social justice should be central in measuring economic impact of long emergencies and choosing ethical options. We collected suggestions for innovative approaches to rationing. CONCLUSIONS This research program illuminates the difficult ethical questions about adapting psychiatry to a prolonged, widespread, and severe emergency. Our interviews identify areas where severe but ethical cuts can be made in medications, hospitals, clinical staff, and administration. Next steps include evidence-based formularies, utilitarian staff cuts, and ethical standards for closing beds or revamping state hospitals. Underserved and diverse communities with rationing experience must have a voice in the discussion.","Black, James E",CNS spectrums,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1092852920002710; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127122/,164
73192,Fauci's straight talk.,2020-03-27,"The demonstrated clinical efficacy of a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vaccine vector has stimulated the investigation of additional serologically distinct Vesiculovirus vectors as therapeutic and/or prophylactic vaccine vectors to combat emerging viral diseases. Among these viral threats are the encephalitic alphaviruses Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), which have demonstrated potential for natural disease outbreaks, yet no licensed vaccines are available in the event of an epidemic. Here we report the rescue of recombinant Isfahan virus (rISFV) from genomic cDNA as a potential new vaccine vector platform. The rISFV genome was modified to attenuate virulence and express the VEEV and EEEV E2/E1 surface glycoproteins as vaccine antigens. A single dose of the rISFV vaccine vectors elicited neutralizing antibody responses and protected mice from lethal VEEV and EEEV challenges at 1 month postvaccination as well as lethal VEEV challenge at 8 months postvaccination. A mixture of rISFV vectors expressing the VEEV and EEEV E2/E1 glycoproteins also provided durable, single-dose protection from lethal VEEV and EEEV challenges, demonstrating the potential for a multivalent vaccine formulation. These findings were paralleled in studies with an attenuated form of rVSV expressing the VEEV E2/E1 glycoproteins. Both the rVSV and rISFV vectors were attenuated by using an approach that has demonstrated safety in human trials of an rVSV/HIV-1 vaccine. Vaccines based on either of these vaccine vector platforms may present a safe and effective approach to prevent alphavirus-induced disease in humans.IMPORTANCE This work introduces rISFV as a novel vaccine vector platform that is serologically distinct and phylogenetically distant from VSV. The rISFV vector has been attenuated by an approach used for an rVSV vector that has demonstrated safety in clinical studies. The vaccine potential of the rISFV vector was investigated in a well-established alphavirus disease model. The findings indicate the feasibility of producing a safe, efficacious, multivalent vaccine against the encephalitic alphaviruses VEEV and EEEV, both of which can cause fatal disease. This work also demonstrates the efficacy of an attenuated rVSV vector that has already demonstrated safety and immunogenicity in multiple HIV-1 phase I clinical studies. The absence of serological cross-reactivity between rVSV and rISFV and their phylogenetic divergence within the Vesiculovirus genus indicate potential for two stand-alone vaccine vector platforms that could be used to target multiple bacterial and/or viral agents in successive immunization campaigns or as heterologous prime-boost agents.","Nasar, Farooq; Matassov, Demetrius; Seymour, Robert L; Latham, Theresa; Gorchakov, Rodion V; Nowak, Rebecca M; Leal, Grace; Hamm, Stefan; Eldridge, John H; Tesh, Robert B; Clarke, David K; Weaver, Scott C",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01729-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28148802/,164

75416,Fairer shares.,2021-05-28,"NEW FINDINGS What is the central question of this study? Our goal was to understand the autonomic responses to eating in patients with congenital afferent baroreflex failure, by documenting changes in blood pressure and heart rate with chewing, swallowing and stomach distension. What is the main finding and its importance? Patients born with lesions in the afferent baroreceptor pathways have an exaggerated pressor response to food intake. This appears to be a sympathetically mediated response, triggered by chewing, that occurs independently of swallowing or distension of the stomach. The chewing-induced pressor response may be useful as a counter-manoeuvre to prevent orthostatic hypotension in these patients. Familial dysautonomia (FD) is a rare genetic disease with extremely labile blood pressure resulting from baroreflex deafferentation. Patients have marked surges in sympathetic activity, frequently surrounding meals. We conducted an observational study to document the autonomic responses to eating in patients with FD and to determine whether sympathetic activation was caused by chewing, swallowing or stomach distension. Blood pressure and R-R intervals were measured continuously while chewing gum (n = 15), eating (n = 20) and distending the stomach by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube feeding (n = 9). Responses were compared with those of normal control subjects (n = 10) and of patients with efferent autonomic failure (n = 10) who have chronically impaired sympathetic outflow. In patients with FD, eating was associated with a marked but transient pressor response (P < 0.0001) and additional signs of sympathetic activation, including tachycardia, diaphoresis and flushing of the skin. Chewing gum evoked a similar increase in blood pressure that was higher in patients with FD than in control subjects (P = 0.0001), but was absent in patients with autonomic failure. In patients with FD, distending the stomach by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube feeding failed to elicit a pressor response. The results provide indirect evidence that chewing triggers sympathetic activation. The increase in blood pressure is exaggerated in patients with FD as a result of blunted afferent baroreceptor signalling. The chewing pressor response may be useful as a counter-manoeuvre to raise blood pressure and prevent symptomatic orthostatic hypotension in patients with FD.","Fuente Mora, Cristina; Norcliffe-Kaufmann, Lucy; Palma, Jose-Alberto; Kaufmann, Horacio",Experimental physiology,https://doi.org/10.1113/ep085340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26435473/,164

Six acoustic facies (low backscatter, dishomogeneous low-backscatter, dishomogeneous high-backscatter, high-backscatter, rocks and high backscatter, and rocks and medium backscatter) were recognized. We studied how rhodoliths characteristics (density, morphotype, size and structure) differently influence the backscatter signature. At the western Pontine Archipelago, rhodolith beds are mainly represented by facies dishomogeneous high backscatter, high backscatter, high backscatter with rocks, and medium backscatter with rocks. The obtained results increase both the knowledge on the heterogeneous structure of such ecologically relevant benthic habitat and highlight the use of distinctive acoustic facies for their identification. Finally, the used approach could be considered a useful method for indirect detection and mapping of rhodolith beds.","Sañé, E; Ingrassia, M; Chiocci, F L; Argenti, L; Martorelli, E",Marine environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2021.105339; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932846/,164

79524,Latest Covid-19 survey provides good news.,2020-10-01,"INTRODUCTION Psychotherapy is a first-line treatment for depression. However, capacities are limited, leading to long waiting times for outpatient psychotherapy in health care systems. Web-based interventions (WBI) could help to bridge this treatment gap. OBJECTIVE This study investigates the effectiveness of a guided cognitive-behavioral WBI in depressive patients seeking face-to-face psychotherapy. METHODS A 2-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted. Depressive patients (n = 136) recruited from the waiting lists of outpatient clinics were randomly assigned to an intervention group (IG; treatment as usual [TAU] + immediate access to WBI) or a control group (CG; TAU + access to WBI after follow-up). Depressive symptoms and secondary outcomes were assessed at baseline, 7 weeks, and 5 months after randomization. RESULTS Mixed-model analyses revealed a significant group × time interaction effect on depressive symptoms (F2, 121.5 = 3.91; p < 0.05). Between-group effect sizes were d = 0.55 at 7 weeks and d = 0.52 at 5 months. The IG was superior regarding psychological symptoms and mental health quality of life but not on physical health quality of life, attitudes, motivation for psychotherapy, or subjective need and uptake of psychotherapy. CONCLUSIONS Patients waiting for face-to-face psychotherapy can benefit from a WBI when compared to TAU. Despite the reduction of depressive symptoms in the IG, the uptake of subsequent psychotherapy was still high in both groups. The effects remained stable at the 5-month follow-up. However, this study could not determine the proportion of specific intervention effects vs. nonspecific effects, such as positive outcome expectations or attention. Future research should focus on the long-term effects and cost-effectiveness of WBI before psychotherapy.","Krämer, Lena Violetta; Grünzig, Sasha-Denise; Baumeister, Harald; Ebert, David Daniel; Bengel, Jürgen",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,https://doi.org/10.1159/000515625; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33946072/,164

Since the introduction of PCR, a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms and enzymes involved in DNA/RNA replication has spurred the development of novel methods devoid of temperature cycling. Isothermal amplification methods have since been introduced utilizing different mechanisms, enzymes, and conditions. The ease with which isothermal amplification methods have allowed nucleic acid amplification to be carried out has had a profound impact on the way molecular diagnostics are being designed after the turn of the millennium. With all the advantages isothermal amplification brings, the issues or complications surrounding each method are heterogeneous making it difficult to identify the best approach for an end-user.

Many surgical and conservative procedures have been described in the treatment of anal fistulas. Fistulectomy and primary sphincter reconstruction (FPSR) has not gained great popularity in this field due to the risk of sphincter damage. The aim of this study is to evaluate FPSR in the treatment of transsphincteric fistulas. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 50 patients with high transsphincteric fistulas of cryptoglandular origin that were treated with FPSR between 2005 and 2008. Preoperative assessment included physical and proctologic examination. Continence and pain scores were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS In our 50 patients, 22 patients (44 %) had a previous proctologic operation and 11 patients (22 %) presented with recurrent fistulas. The fistulas existed for an average of 8 months. The operation time was 28 ± 16 min. Mean follow-up was 22± months. The fistula healed in 44 patients (88 %) who developed no recurrence. In five patients (10 %), the fistula healed, but they developed a recurrence in the observation period. In one patient (2 %), the fistula did not heal. Three patients developed low-grade incontinence for flatus, and one patient with 2° incontinence improved. Preoperatively and postoperatively calculated continence and pain scores showed a slight but significant elevation in the Clinical Continence Score, the German Society of Coloproctology Score showed no significant difference, and preexisting pain was reduced significantly by surgery. CONCLUSIONS FPSR is a safe surgical procedure for the treatment of high transsphincteric anal fistula. The primary healing rate is high with a low risk of recurrence or incontinence.","Hirschburger, Markus; Schwandner, Thilo; Hecker, Andreas; Kierer, Walter; Weinel, Rolf; Padberg, Winfried",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-013-1788-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24337835/,164

RESULTS in the performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, nursing professionals are exposed to violence of different natures related to occupational stress, work overload, anguishes and silenced suffering, with implications for the workers' health, who can be benefited and strengthened with empathetic listening. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS the health crisis has highlighted the weaknesses of the health system. Nursing acts as the largest contingent of the health workforce in coping with the pandemic. Empathetic listening is a powerful strategy in caring for and strengthening nursing professionals.","Tobase, Lucia; Cardoso, Sandra Helena; Rodrigues, Renata Tavares Franco; Peres, Heloisa Helena Ciqueto",Revista brasileira de enfermagem,https://doi.org/10.1590/0034-7167-2020-0721; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33566956/,164
84940,Coronapod: COVID's origins and the 'lab leak' theory.,2021-03-05,"BACKGROUND National guidelines recommend dysphagia screening (DS) before oral intake in stroke patients to reduce hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). We examined the relationship between DS and HAP after ischemic stroke. METHODS Get with the Guidelines-Stroke defines HAP as postadmission diagnosis of pneumonia requiring antibiotics, and DS as the use of bedside swallow screening prior to oral intake. Univariable and multivariable analyses examined the relationship between DS and HAP. RESULTS Among 314,007 ischemic stroke patients at 1244 Get with the Guidelines-Stroke hospitals from 2003-2009 who were eligible for DS and had completed HAP data, a total of 216,372 (68.9%) underwent DS and a total of 17,906 (5.7%) developed HAP. When compared with patients without HAP, patients with HAP were older, had admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (median NIHSS score: 10 versus 4), were more likely to undergo DS (75.5% versus 68.5%), and had increased length of stay and in-hospital mortality (12.4% versus 2.3%). In multivariable analyses, factors independently associated with a lower risk of HAP were female gender (odds ratio [OR] 0.84), dyslipidemia (OR 0.84), and hypertension (OR 0.94). DS was associated with a higher adjusted OR for HAP (OR 1.40), but the OR was greatly attenuated after adding NIHSS score to the model (OR 1.10). CONCLUSIONS HAP occurs in 1 of 17 hospitalized stroke patients and is associated with a greater than 5-fold increase in mortality. DS did not occur in 31.1% of eligible patients, with increased screening among those with more severe strokes and those who developed HAP. The attenuation of the relationship between DS and HAP risk when controlling for NIHSS score suggests the association between screening and pneumonia is confounded by severity. Controlled trials are needed to determine DS effectiveness.","Masrur, Shihab; Smith, Eric E; Saver, Jeffrey L; Reeves, Mathew J; Bhatt, Deepak L; Zhao, Xin; Olson, DaiWai; Pan, Wenqin; Hernandez, Adrian F; Fonarow, Gregg C; Schwamm, Lee H",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2012.11.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23305674/,164

86391,Coronapod: the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID vaccine - what you need to know.,2021-03-26,"Ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes requires the participation of several transactivation factors that are involved in the modification, assembly, transport and quality control of the ribosomal subunits. One of these factors is the Large subunit GTPase 1 (Lsg1), a protein that acts as the release factor for the export adaptor named Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay 3 protein (Nmd3) and facilitates the incorporation of the last structural protein uL16 into the 60S subunit. Here, we characterised the recombinant yeast Lsg1 and studied its catalysis and binding properties for guanine nucleotides. We described the interaction of Lsg1 with guanine nucleotides alone and in the presence of the complex Nmd3•60S using fluorescence spectroscopy. Lsg1 has a greater affinity for GTP than for GDP suggesting that in the cell cytoplasm it exists mainly bound to the former. In the presence of 60S subunits loaded with Nmd3, the affinity of Lsg1 for both nucleotides increases but to a larger extent towards GTP. From this observation together with the excess of GTP present in the cytoplasm of exponentially growing cells over that of GDP, we can infer that the pre-ribosomal particle composed by Nmd3•60S acts as a GTP Stabilising Factor for Lsg1. Additionally, Lsg1 undergoes different conformational changes depending on its binding partner or the guanine nucleotides it interacts with. Steady-state kinetic analysis of free Lsg1 indicated slow GTP hydrolysis with values of kcat 1 min-1 and Km of 34 μM.","Jaramillo-Ramírez, Juliana; Marcial-Bazaldua, Nancy; Sánchez-Puig, Nuria",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

86972,"In plasma OK, critics see politics, not science.",2020-08-28,"The aim of the systematic review described in this article was to determine the outcomes for individuals exposed to severe neglect in congregate care institutions such as orphanages. In this context, severe neglect refers to failure to meet children's basic physical, developmental, and emotional needs due to inadequate resources. In this systematic review of previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses, searches of 10 databases were conducted, 18 papers that met inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected for review, their quality was assessed, and data were extracted and synthesized. The 550 primary studies included in the 18 systematic reviews and meta-analyses were relatively well designed, allowing confidence to be placed in their results. Severe neglect was associated with a wide range of problems in the domains of physical development, cognitive development, attachment, and mental health. The severity of adverse outcomes was partly influenced by the duration and severity of deprivation and a constellation of risk and protective factors. Prevention policies should aim to eliminate large underresourced congregate care institutions for infants. In taking steps toward this, policies should aim to adequately resource congregate care institutions to meet children's developmental needs for nutrition, stimulation, and attachment to a stable primary caregiver with adequate parenting skills and training. Early placement in adoptive or foster families, with access to routine physical and mental health-care service available in developed countries, is the most viable effective intervention for child survivors of severe neglect.","Carr, Alan; Duff, Hollie; Craddock, Fiona","Trauma, violence & abuse",https://doi.org/10.1177/1524838018777788; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29779452/,164

The interpretation of absolute values is often debated for various reasons, but the changes in pressure measured are considered very accurate provided that a number of precautions are taken. The information provided by these measurements is unique in nature and has an enormous potential to influence management. It allows to study the exact influence of the chest wall and to determine the real lung distending pressure. It is also the only way to quantify respiratory muscle activity and the work of breathing. RECENT FINDINGS The application of esophageal pressure monitoring potentially covers a large field, especially for what concerns mechanical ventilation. This goes from the acute phase of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to weaning and patient-ventilator interactions. During ARDS, recent findings indicate that this measurement may help titrating the level of positive end-expiratory pressure or to determine the well tolerated upper limit of airway pressure. SUMMARY Application of esophageal pressure monitoring is limited by technical issues, the need for background physiological knowledge and the fact that very few studies have assessed a direct influence of this measurement on patients' outcome. The technique is underused in everyday practice.","Brochard, Laurent",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24300619/,164

Patients reported chronic pelvic pain using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and severity of dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia and pelvic tenderness using the verbal rating scale (VRS). Quality of life (physical, psychological, social, environmental domains) was evaluated using the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF). There were no correlations between quality of life and VRS and VAS scores of chronic pelvic pain in patients with dyspareunia (p > 0.05).

88418,Orthopedic Interface Repair Strategies Based on Native Structural and Mechanical Features of the Multiscale Enthesis.,2017-11-13,"Introduction Care of patients with chronic medical and mental health conditions can be a source of frustration for primary care clinicians and may present a challenge in modeling effective interventions for medical learners. Mind-body medicine (MBM) interventions have shown success for a variety of conditions, and training in MBM has been associated with decreased burnout and improved professional satisfaction.8 We piloted MBM collaborative visits led by faculty physicians and facilitated by medical learners. We then assessed their efficacy treating patients with complex needs. Methods We conducted a series of eight weekly 2.5-hour MBM interventions for groups of five to eight participants (52 in total) with chronic health conditions. Matched-pair hypothesis t tests analyzed nine health indicators measured pre- and postintervention: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) as well as participants' perceived mental and physical health, stress and stress coping, agency, and capacity to connect with others. We made conservative calculations of effect size using Hedges' g. Results Participants showed significant, large improvements in their PHQ-9 scores ( P<.005, g=0.807), and moderate improvements in ability to cope with stress (P<.005, g=0.502), sense of control over their diagnoses (P<.05, g=0.413), and perceived overall mental health (P<.05, g=0.424). Other outcomes were nonsignificant, including a small improvement in participants' perceived overall health ( P=.071, g=0.286). Conclusions Patients completing the intervention enjoyed largely improved outcomes despite unchanged stress at work and home. Physician-led MBM collaborative visits comprise a feasible, reproducible, and reimbursable treatment option for improving patient care. They also immerse medical learners in an evidence-based practice model supportive of professional satisfaction.","Moir, Elwyn; Yang, Jamie O; Yao, Jimmy; Weinlander, Eva",PRiMER,https://doi.org/10.22454/primer.2021.548093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33860159/,164

89084,Resuming Practice After COVID-19.,2020,"BACKGROUND Although eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) has been reported to be a potential oncogenic factor in many human cancers, its usefulness as a clinical prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer has not been investigated. METHODS In this study, data about 540 patients with stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) were analyzed from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases to determine the expression of eEF2K. Immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blots, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were also performed to determine the clinical significance of eEF2K expression in 96 postoperative patients with gastric cancer. Among the 96 patients, 36 had low expression of eEF2K and 60 had high expression. RESULTS Analysis of the TCGA and GEO datasets revealed that eEF2K expression was significantly higher in the STAD tissue samples than in the non-tumorous gastric tissues. IHC, western blots, and RT-PCR confirmed these findings. The high expression level of eEF2K was found to be related to the presence of lymph node metastasis (p = 0.002). Moreover, multivariate analysis showed that eEF2K was an independent indicator of prognosis for overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-2.79; p = 0.03) and disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 1.66, 95% CI = 0.997-2.765; p = 0.052) in patients with surgically resected STAD. CONCLUSION Collectively, our findings suggest that eEF2K is a clinical indicator of metastatic and prognostic significance for STAD survival and could serve as a potential therapeutic target.","Jiang, Mingxia; Qi, Ling; Jin, Kexin; Li, Lisha; Wu, Yiming; Song, Dongfeng; Gan, Junqing; Huang, Mei; Li, Yanjing; Song, Chengxin","Pathology, research and practice",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prp.2021.153568; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352439/,164

Investigations are ongoing in the search for effective therapeutics, with clinical approaches evolving based upon such evidence. RECENT FINDINGS The antiviral agent, remdesivir, and the immunomodulator, dexamethasone, are the first therapeutics for which there is evidence of efficacy from randomized trials. Subgroup analyses suggest remdesivir is beneficial in hospitalized patients whose severity of illness falls at the lower end of the spectrum, while dexamethasone is more beneficial in hospitalized patients whose severity of illness falls at the higher end of the spectrum. We recommend that inpatients who require supplemental oxygen but are not mechanically ventilated receive both remdesivir and dexamethasone, and inpatients who require mechanical ventilation receive dexamethasone monotherapy. Additional evidence regarding anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, convalescent plasma, and a variety of antiinterleukin therapies is forthcoming. SUMMARY The body of evidence related to COVID-19 therapeutics continues to evolve and, as a result, management is likely to change with time. As new evidence is generated and published, the optimal approach to managing patients with COVID-19 should be reconsidered.","Wilson, Kevin C",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0000000000000766; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33606409/,164

Participants received extended-release hydromorphone 16 mg in the fasted state and immediately after a high-fat breakfast. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of a 16-mg dose of extended-release hydromorphone and a 16-mg daily dose (4 mg qid) of immediate-release hydromorphone in the fasted state were compared. Treatments were separated by washout periods of 7 to 14 days. Naltrexone was given throughout each treatment period to block the opioid effects of hydromorphone. The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the ratios of geometric means for maximum plasma concentrations (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for extended-release hydromorphone in the fed and fasted states were within the bioequivalence criteria range of 80% to 125%. In the fasted state, the 90% CIs of the ratios of AUC geometric means for extended-release hydromorphone and immediate-release hydromorphone were also within the bioequivalence range. Both hydromorphone treatments were well tolerated. This study shows that the bioavailability of extended-release hydromorphone is not affected by food and that the bioavailability of extended-release hydromorphone under fasting conditions is comparable with that of the immediate-release formulation when administered at the same total daily dose.","Moore, Kenneth Todd; St-Fleur, Dominique; Marricco, Nadia Cardillo; Ariyawansa, Jay; Pagé, Véronique; Natarajan, Jayalakshmi; Morelli, Gaetano; Richarz, Ute",Journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0091270010383858; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21098692/,164

BACKGROUND Patients in cardiogenic shock with severe MR have a poor prognosis in the setting of conventional medical therapy. Because of its favorable safety profile, TMVr is being increasingly used as an acute therapy in this population, though its efficacy remains unknown. METHODS A multicenter, collaborative, patient-level analysis was conducted. Patients with cardiogenic shock and moderate to severe (3+) or severe (4+) MR who were not surgical candidates were treated with TMVr. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality Secondary outcomes included 90-day mortality, heart failure (HF) hospitalization, and the combined event rate of 90-day mortality and HF hospitalization following dichotomization by TMVr device success. RESULTS Between January 2011 and February 2019, 141 patients across 14 institutions met the inclusion criteria. In-hospital mortality occurred in 22 patients (15.6%), at 90 days in 38 patients (29.5%), and at one year in 55 patients (42.6%). Median length of hospital stay following TMVr was 10 days (interquartile range: 6 to 20 days). HF hospitalization occurred in 26 patients (18.4%) at a median of 73 days (interquartile range: 26 to 546 days). When stratified by TMVr procedural results, successful TMVr reduced rates of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13 to 0.98; p = 0.04), 90-day mortality (HR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.78; p = 0.01), and the composite of 90-day mortality and HF hospitalization (HR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.90; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS TMVr may improve short- and intermediate-term mortality in high-risk patients with cardiogenic shock and moderate to severe MR. Randomized studies are needed to definitively establish MR as a therapeutic target in patients with cardiogenic shock.","Jung, Richard G; Simard, Trevor; Kovach, Christopher; Flint, Kelsey; Don, Creighton; Di Santo, Pietro; Adamo, Marianna; Branca, Luca; Valentini, Francesca; Benito-González, Tomás; Fernández-Vázquez, Felipe; Estévez-Loureiro, Rodrigo; Berardini, Alessandra; Conti, Nicolina; Rapezzi, Claudio; Biagini, Elena; Parlow, Simon; Shorr, Risa; Levi, Amos; Manovel, Ana; Cardenal-Piris, Rosa; Diaz Fernandez, Jose; Shuvy, Mony; Haberman, Dan; Sala, Alessandra; Alkhouli, Mohamad A; Marini, Claudia; Bargagna, Marta; Schiavi, Davide; Denti, Paolo; Markovic, Sinisa; Buzzatti, Nicola; Chan, Vincent; Hynes, Mark; Mesana, Thierry; Labinaz, Marino; Pappalardo, Federico; Taramasso, Maurizio; Hibbert, Benjamin",JACC.

Surprisingly, very few studies have examined the potential neurotoxic action of Chq exposure at different points of gestation or how this phenomenon may affect neurophysiological well-being in later life. We therefore studied behavior, and the expression of specific genes and neurochemicals modulating crucial neural processes in offspring of rats exposed to prophylactic dose of Chq during different stages of gestation. Pregnant rats were injected 5 mg/kg/day (3 times) of Chq either during early- (first week), mid- (second week), late- (third week), or throughout- (all weeks) gestation, while controls received PBS injection. Behavioral characterization of offspring between postnatal days 15-20 in the open field, Y-maze, elevated plus and elevated zero mazes revealed that Chq evoked anxiogenic responses and perturbed spatial memory in rats, although locomotor activity was generally unaltered. In the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus and cerebellum of rats prenatally exposed to Chq, RT-qPCR analysis revealed decreased mRNA expression of presynaptic marker synaptophysin, which was accompanied by downregulation of postsynaptic marker PSD95. Synaptic marker PICK1 expression was also downregulated in the hippocampus but was unperturbed in the PFC and cerebellum. In addition to recorded SOD downregulation in cortical and hippocampal lysates, induction of oxidative stress in rats prenatally exposed to Chq was corroborated by lipid peroxidation as evinced by increased MDA levels. Offspring of rats infused with Chq at mid-gestation and weekly treatment throughout gestation were particularly susceptible to neurotoxic changes, especially in the hippocampus. Interestingly, Chq did not cause histopathological changes in any of the brain areas. Taken together, our findings causally link intrauterine exposure to Chq with postnatal behavioral impairment and neurotoxic changes in rats.","Olajide, Olayemi Joseph; Alliy, Zainab Omolara; Ojo, Daniel Oluwapelumi; Osinubi, Olajumoke Olamipe; Bello, Sofiyat Opeyemi; Ibrahim, Faaizah Eniola; Adukwu, Faith Ojochenemi; Abikoye, Tolulope Olabisi; Gbadamosi, Ismail Tayo; Mutholib, Nafisat Yetunde; Bamisi, Olawande; Ajiboye, Olaolu Joseph; Okesina, Akeem Ayodeji; Alli-Oluwafuyi, Abdulmusawwir; Oyewole, Aboyeji Lukuman; Nafiu, Abdulrazaq Bidemi; Akinola, Olugbenga",Neurotoxicology and teratology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ntt.2021.106982; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33845156/,164

Endoscopic balloon dilatation (EBD) is a minimally invasive treatment intended to avoid surgery; however, whether EBD prevents subsequent surgery remains unclear. We aimed to reveal the factors contributing to surgery in patients with small bowel stricture and the factors associated with subsequent surgery after initial EBD. METHODS Data were retrospectively collected from surgically untreated CD patients who developed symptomatic small bowel stricture after 2008 when the use of balloon-assisted enteroscopy and maintenance therapy with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) became available. RESULTS A total of 305 cases from 32 tertiary referral centers were enrolled. Cumulative surgery-free survival was 74.0% at 1 year, 54.4% at 5 years, and 44.3% at 10 years. The factors associated with avoiding surgery were non-stricturing, non-penetrating disease at onset, mild severity of symptoms, successful EBD, stricture length < 2 cm, and immunomodulator or anti-TNF added after onset of obstructive symptoms. In 95 cases with successful initial EBD, longer EBD interval was associated with lower risk of surgery. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that an EBD interval of ≤ 446 days predicted subsequent surgery, and the proportion of smokers was significantly high in patients who required frequent dilatation. CONCLUSIONS In CD patients with symptomatic small bowel stricture, addition of immunomodulator or anti-TNF and smoking cessation may improve the outcome of symptomatic small bowel stricture, by avoiding frequent EBD and subsequent surgery after initial EBD.","Bamba, Shigeki; Sakemi, Ryosuke; Fujii, Toshimitsu; Takeda, Teruyuki; Fujioka, Shin; Takenaka, Kento; Kitamoto, Hiroki; Umezawa, Shotaro; Sakuraba, Hirotake; Inokuchi, Toshihiro; Fukata, Norimasa; Mizuno, Shinta; Yamashita, Masaki; Shinzaki, Shinichiro; Tanaka, Hiroki; Takedatsu, Hidetoshi; Ozaki, Ryo; Moriya, Kei; Ishii, Manabu; Kinjo, Tetsu; Ozeki, Keiji; Ooi, Makoto; Hayashi, Ryohei; Kakimoto, Kazuki; Shimodate, Yuichi; Kitamura, Kazuya; Yamada, Akihiro; Sonoda, Akira; Nishida, Yu; Yoshioka, Kyouko; Ashizuka, Shinya; Takahashi, Fumiaki; Shimokawa, Toshio; Kobayashi, Taku; Andoh, Akira; Hibi, Toshifumi",Journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00535-020-01670-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31989252/,164

However, little detail is known about how DENV interacts with the host-cell machinery to facilitate its translation and replication. In DENV-infected HepG2 cells, an increase in the level of LC3-II (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 form II), the autophagosomal membrane-bound form of LC3, was observed, and LC3 was found to co-localize with dsRNA and DENV NS1 protein, as well as ribosomal protein L28, indicating the presence of at least some of the DENV translation/replication machinery on autophagic vacuoles. Inhibition of fusion of autophagic vacuoles with lysosomes resulted in an increase in both intracellular and extracellular virus, and co-localization observed between mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR) and dsRNA and between MPR and LC3 identified the autophagic vacuoles as amphisomes. Amphisomes are formed as a result of fusion between endosomal and autophagic vacuoles, and as such provide a direct link between virus entry and subsequent replication and translation.","Panyasrivanit, Mingkwan; Khakpoor, Atefeh; Wikan, Nitwara; Smith, Duncan R",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.005355-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19141455/,164

This study's objectives were to describe patient perspectives on their experience during and after an ED visit for hyperglycaemia and to identify factors that influence postdischarge adherence. METHODS We conducted a qualitative description (QD) study of adult patients who had visited a Canadian ED for hyperglycaemia. Consistent with QD, purposive sampling was utilised, seeking diversity across age, gender and diabetes type. Participants took part in semistructured interviews and thematic analysis was used to identify and describe core themes. Frequent team meetings were held to review the analysis and to develop the final list of themes used to recode the data set. Analytic insights were tracked using reflective memos and an audit trail documented all steps and decisions. RESULTS 22 patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes were interviewed from June to October 2019. Participants identified several factors that impacted their ability to adhere to discharge plans: communication of instructions, psychosocial factors (financial considerations, shame and guilt, stigma and mental health), access to follow-up care and paediatric to adult care transitions. CONCLUSIONS This study describes the patient experience with the communication of discharge instructions, as well as factors affecting adherence post-ED discharge for hyperglycaemia. Our findings suggest four strategies that could improve the patient experience, improve adherence to discharge plans and potentially decrease the frequency of recurrent ED visits for hyperglycaemia.","Yan, Justin; Azzam, Dimah; Columbus, Melanie; Van Aarsen, Kristine; Liu, Selina; Spaic, Tamara; Shepherd, Lisa",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2020-210677; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33947748/,164
92042,How do children spread the coronavirus? The science still isn't clear.,2020-05-07,"Due to the widespread application of glyphosate, a nonselective herbicide, to a variety of resistant food crops, the general population is exposed to glyphosate through dietary intake. Despite this, dietary exposures to glyphosate are considered low in comparison to application-related exposures. Although previous studies have evaluated exposure to horticultural and agricultural workers, to date only one study, which we recently conducted, has characterized exposure to glyphosate in consumers following heavy residential application of a glyphosate-containing herbicide in a residential yard and garden setting. In this previous study, we demonstrated that urinary glyphosate concentrations in these applicators were similar to or in some circumstances greater than those in occupational applicators, likely due to the nature of the simulation study, which ensured a heavy application protocol. However, it is unknown whether these urinary glyphosate concentrations in consumer applicators correspond to internal doses that may be of concern. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive risk assessment of glyphosate exposure in consumer applicators using a margin of safety approach. Here, we incorporated data collected from multiple spot urine samples across time from our previous study that assessed consumer exposure to glyphosate from Roundup® application. Estimated internal doses, even with the use of conservative assumptions across unique approaches, were below internal doses estimated from established health-based guidance values. Overall, this study demonstrates that glyphosate exposure from even heavy consumer application of a commercially available glyphosate-containing herbicide does not appear to be a health concern.","Kougias, Daniel G; Miller, Eric; McEwen, Abigail; Reamer, Heidi; Kovochich, Michael; Pierce, Jennifer",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.13646; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33245586/,164

This research evaluates the association between mandibular symphysis dimensions and anteroposterior and vertical skeletal patterns in adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS This cross-sectional cephalometric study included 90 lateral cephalograms of untreated subjects presenting for orthodontic treatment. The inclusion criteria were adults with lateral cephalograms showing the symphyseal region and anterior cranial base. One investigator traced and analyzed all cephalograms. Symphyseal height, thickness, and ratio between height and thickness were measured in relation to seven anteroposterior and vertical skeletal measurements in females and males. RESULTS Symphyseal measurements were associated with SNAo (anteroposterior) in females and Gonial angle (vertical) in males. When analyzed by anteroposterior skeletal classification (ANBo), no significant differences in symphyseal dimensions were found. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that Gonion-Nerve (mm) and Gonial angle were significantly associated with symphyseal height. Gonion-Nerve (mm), basal bone width (mm), and alveolar bone height (mm) were associated with symphyseal thickness. Basal bone width (mm) and alveolar bone height (mm) were associated with symphyseal ratio. CONCLUSIONS Symphyseal dimensions were significantly associated with vertical but not anteroposterior skeletal patterns. Future studies are warranted to evaluate the Gonion-nerve measurements concerning the symphysis in relation to vertical and anteroposterior skeletal patterns.","Marghalani, H Y A; Guan, G; Hyun, P; Tabbaa, S; Linjawi, A I; Al-Jewair, T",Folia morphologica,https://doi.org/10.5603/fm.a2021.0045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33954960/,164

New abbreviated CMR protocols can be less expensive, faster, whilst maintaining accuracy, potentially leading to a higher utilization in LMICs. AREAS COVERED This article will review cardiovascular disease in LMICs and the current role of CMR in cardiac diagnosis and enable targeted therapy, discussing the main obstacles to prevent the adoption of CMR in LMICs. We will then review the potential utility of abbreviated, cost-effective CMR protocols to improve cardiac diagnosis and care, the clinical indications of the exam, current evidence and future directions. EXPERT OPINION Rapid CMR protocols, provided that they are utilized in potentially high yield cases, could reduce cost and increase effectiveness. The adoption of these protocols, their integration into care pathways, and prioritizing key treatable diagnoses can potentially improve patient care. Several LMIC countries are now pioneering these approaches and the application of rapid CMR protocols appears to have a bright future if delivered effectively.","Menacho Medina, Katia; Seraphim, Andreas; Katekaru, Diana; Abdel-Gadir, Amna; Han, Yuchi; Westwood, Mark; Walker, J Malcolm; Moon, James C; Herrey, Anna S",Expert review of cardiovascular therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14779072.2021.1915130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33836619/,164

We also compared peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) measurements between Nellcor and Masimo oximeters. METHOD Term infants born via elective caesarean section were studied. ECG leads were placed on the infant's chest and abdomen. Masimo and Nellcor PO sensors were randomly allocated to either foot. The monitors were placed on a trolley, and data from each monitor screen captured by a video camera. HR, SpO2 measurements and signal quality were extracted. Bland-Altman analysis was used to determine agreement between HR from the ECG and each oximeter, and between SpO2 from the oximeters. RESULTS We studied 44 infants of whom 4 were resuscitated. More than 8000 pairs of observations were used for each comparison of HR and SpO2. The mean difference (±2SD) between HRECG and HRN ellcor was -0.8 (±11) beats per minute (bpm); between HRECG and HRM asimo was 0.2 (±9) bpm. The mean (±2SD) difference between SpO2Masimo and SpO2Nellcor was -3 (±15)%. The Nellcor PO measured 20% higher than the Masimo PO at SpO2 <70%. CONCLUSION Both oximeters accurately measure HR. There was good agreement between SpO2 measurements when SpO2 ≥70%. At lower SpO2 , agreement was poorer.","Dawson, J A; Saraswat, A; Simionato, L; Thio, M; Kamlin, C O F; Owen, L S; Schmölzer, G M; Davis, P G",Acta paediatrica,https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.12329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23800004/,164

95788,How CDC foundered.,2020-10-23,"BACKGROUND Superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass is a treatment option for hemodynamic insufficiency in the anterior cerebral circulation. Complications associated with extracranial-intracranial bypass surgeries are ischemic strokes caused by bypass failure, wound-healing disorders, and further issues from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage. CSF leakage can provide pathways for infection. It is well known in general neurosurgery that watertight closure of the dura mater is necessary to prevent such complications. OBJECTIVE To provide a technical description of TachoSil dural reconstruction in standard STA-MCA bypasses and their follow-up analyses. METHODS In this technical report with observational follow-up, the dura mater was closed partially by adaptive sutures, and the perforation site of the donor vessel was sealed with TachoSil. TachoSil is a collagen sponge covered with clotting factors that provides hemostatic and sealing effects. RESULTS Our study included eight cases of standard STA-MCA bypasses that had been operated between July 2015 and September 2016. Follow-up examinations were completed for all patients at 1 month and 6 months after surgery. Duplex and Doppler ultrasound demonstrated regular bypass patency in all patients without increased flow velocity at the perforation sites, which is a possible sign of stenosis. No wound-healing disorders or CSF leakage occurred. No cerebrovascular stroke events were observed. CONCLUSION Duraplasty with TachoSil enables the elastic reconstruction of the dura perforation gap in standard extracranial-intracranial bypass surgeries.","Tews, Julia; Jahromi, Behnam Rezai; Ludtka, Christopher; Schwan, Stefan; Ota, Nakao; Meisel, Hans Joerg; Tanikawa, Rokuya; Lawton, Michael; Goehre, Felix","Journal of neurological surgery.

Resection surface samples were collected immediately after the operation from the first group, and at 1 week and 3 weeks after the operation from the second and third groups, respectively. The samples were histologically investigated. RESULTS Spray diathermy was shown to cause parenchymaI destruction of varying depth on the resection surface due to immediate coagulation and consequent necrosis. CONCLUSION Spray diathermy on the resection surface can also destroy the area that contains possible tumor cells after R1 resection and increases the tumor clearance without worse survival outcomes.","Palkovics, András; Vereczkei, András; Fincsur, András; Kiss, István; Németh, Balázs; Takács, Ildikó; Papp, András",Anticancer research,https://doi.org/10.21873/anticanres.14077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32132032/,164

97990,Covering the Cover.,2019,"BACKGROUND Common cold is one of the most prevalent conditions that family doctors encounter. One of the first symptoms to occur is nasal congestion, which can have a negative impact on daily life and prompts many patients to seek treatment for relief. Xylometazoline nasal spray (Otrivin*) is a topical decongestant that has been used successfully for many years and is generally recognized as an effective and safe therapy. However, most studies have investigated its clinical efficacy in healthy patients and few have included patients with common cold. SCOPE To review the published clinical efficacy and safety of xylometazoline alone and in combination in the management of nasal congestion in patients with common cold. Literature searches of PubMed and the Cochrane Library were conducted to obtain published open or blinded, randomized, placebo- or active-controlled studies on the use of xylometazoline hydrochloride for the symptomatic relief of nasal congestion in patients with common cold. Searches included papers published in English only, up to September 2009. FINDINGS Despite the small number of studies identified in common cold (n = 4), as per search criteria defined, intranasal xylometazoline quickly and effectively relieved nasal congestion. When used alone, xylometazoline had a clinically relevant decongestant effect that was significantly superior for up to 10 hours compared with placebo. The superior decongestant effect with xylometazoline led to high patient satisfaction with treatment. When used in combination with ipratropium bromide, nasal congestion and rhinorrhoea were treated simultaneously, leading to significantly higher patient general impression scores compared with either agent used alone. Xylometazoline was well tolerated, with generally mild to moderate nasal-related side effects (e.g. epistaxis in 3.4% of patients, and blood-tinged mucus in 10-26% of patients) that were easily resolved; the most frequently reported non-nasal AEs were headache (3.4%) and period pain (10.3%); no cases of sedation were reported. As expected, no rhinitis medicamentosa or rebound congestion was noted with short-term use (<10 days). No clinically important differences in ciliary motility and mucociliary clearance were observed. Xylometazoline does not result in sympathomimetic systemic side effects seen with oral decongestants (e.g. pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine). CONCLUSIONS The few studies available in common cold suggest that intranasal xylometazoline provides fast and effective relief of nasal congestion and is well tolerated. When xylometazoline is used in combination with ipratropium, patients with common cold experience the additive benefit of nasal congestion and rhinorrhoea being treated simultaneously.","Eccles, Ronald; Martensson, Kaj; Chen, Shirley C",Current medical research and opinion,https://doi.org/10.1185/03007991003648015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20151787/,164

Increased access to specialist care in a regional setting is an additional benefit. Variation in diagnostic accuracy of telehealth consultations may affect diagnosis and management. Therefore, our aim is to determine the diagnostic concordance of telemedicine for otolaryngology in an Australian regional setting with physical consultations. METHODS Retrospective review was conducted for all patients who received an initial telemedicine appointment over a 7-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic in regional Victoria, Australia. Data were collected regarding initial diagnosis and management from telemedicine consultations, subsequent physical appointment findings and management and intraoperative findings. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism (version 8.0, GraphPad). RESULTS Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were included. The most common conditions referred were for consideration of tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy (44.0%). Overall diagnostic concordance of the initial referrer was 63.3% and for telephone appointments, it was 81.9%. Concordance of recommended treatment plans between telephone and physical appointments was 96.9%.

100677,University reopening plans under fire.,2020-07-24,"OBJECTIVES To characterize the study population, estimating the in-hospital lethality rate by state and analysing associated factors with COVID-19-related deaths. METHODS A retrospective cohort study was carried out of hospitalised children and adolescents diagnosed with COVID-19, confirmed by RT-PCR, whose outcome was death by COVID-19 or recovery, from 2020 March 1 to August 1. The data source was the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System (SIVEP-Gripe in Brazilian acronym), where patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are notified. Children were defined as those between the ages of 0 and 11, and adolescents those between 12 and 18. A bi and multivariate analysis were performed using Poisson Regression with robust variance, with adjusted Relative Risk as the final association measure. RESULTS A total of 4,930 cases were analysed; 2,553 (51.8%) were males, 2,335 (47.4%) were brown-skinned. The Federative Unit of Roraima presented the highest in-hospital case-fatality rate, with 68.8% (11/16). Multivariate analysis showed that belonging to the age group adolescent (RR = 1.59; 95%CI 1.12 - 2.25; p = 0.009), SARS-critical patient (RR = 4.56; 95%CI 2, 77 - 7.51; p < 0.001) and presenting immunological disorders (RR = 2.24; 95%CI 1.58 - 3.17; p < 0.001) as comorbidities were statistically associated factors with death by COVID-19. CONCLUSION It was observed that adolescents, SARS-critical patients, and presence of immunological disorders were important factors associated with death. Active surveillance and differentiated care are recommended for patients with chronic diseases and special immunological conditions.","Gomes, Nivreanes Tcherno Nulle; Haslett, Maria Isabella Claudino; Alves, Ana Julia Silva E; Percio, Jadher; Duarte, Magda Machado Saraiva; Malta, Juliane Maria Alves Siqueira; Carvalho, Felipe Cotrim de; Almeida, Walquiria Aparecida Ferreira de; Gava, Caroline; Souza, Libia Roberta de Oliveira; Fantinato, Francieli Fontana Sutile Tardetti; Santos, Elizabeth David Dos",Revista brasileira de epidemiologia = Brazilian journal of epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1590/1980-549720200026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34378752/,164

101162,How the FDA should protect its integrity from politics.,2020-09-01,"A strong association is noted between depression and early perimenopause as well as menopause. The association was found to be the greatest in women with natural menopause at the age less than 40 years. Excessive corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels in depression lead to inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and increased cortisol levels which further inhibits the action of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, gonadotrophs, and gonads. The resulting changes in luteinizing hormone (LH) amplitude, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, and LH pulse frequency were noted in patients with depression. Besides depression, earlier surgical menopause is associated with cognitive decline. In addition, it is seen that menopausal changes predisposed females to an increased risk of depression. The association between dysmenorrhea and depression was found to be bidirectional and congruent in most studies. Patients with dysmenorrhea and coexisting depression had enhanced pain perception along with a poor response to pain relief measures. Even the treatment of underlying depression has been shown to cause menorrhagia. On the other hand, amenorrhea has also been reported as a side effect of sertraline and electroconvulsive therapy. Menstrual disorders contribute to a significant number of outpatient gynecological visits per year in the United States. Co-existing or history of depression can either be the cause of or interfere in the treatment of these disorders. Furthermore, the treatment of depression can be the etiology of various menstrual abnormalities, while menstrual disorders themselves could be the cause of depression. The increasing prevalence of depression, women's health, multiple female-specific subtypes, and the preexisting burden of menstrual disorders necessitates more detailed studies on the effects of depression on the menstrual cycle.","Padda, Jaskamal; Khalid, Khizer; Hitawala, Gazala; Batra, Nitya; Pokhriyal, Sindhu; Mohan, Ayushi; Zubair, Ujala; Cooper, Ayden Charlene; Jean-Charles, Gutteridge",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34430141/,164
101552,Science could benefit as Democrats take power.,2021-01-15,"BACKGROUND Living donor kidneys with multiple arteries (MA) are increasingly procured laparoscopically for transplant. METHODS We compare long-term graft function and survival of kidneys with single arteries (SA) and MA over a 10-year period. RESULTS There were a total of 218 grafts with SA and 60 grafts with MA. The MA group had longer operative and ischemic times than SA group. There was a small increase in ureteral complication (8.3% vs. 2.3% P=0.06) and a significantly higher incidence of rejection (23.3% vs. 10.1%, P=0.01) in MA group than in SA group. Graft function was lower in MA group than SA group. The 5-year graft survival by Kaplan Meier analysis was better in SA group than in MA group (P=0.023). The estimated graft survivals at 1, 3, and 5 year were 94.4%, 90.6%, and 86% for SA group and 89.6%, 83.2%, and 71.8% for MA group. There was a higher percentage of graft loss from chronic allograft nephropathy in MA group than in SA group (16.7% vs. 5.5%, P=0.01). The presence of MA (vs. SA) was an independent risk for acute rejection (OR 3.60, 95% CI 1.59-8.14, P=0.002) and for graft loss (HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.05-5.09, P=0.038). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic procurement of living donor kidneys with SA may be associated with a lower risk of rejection, better function, and superior long-term survival when compared with kidneys with MA.","Paramesh, Anil; Zhang, Rubin; Florman, Sandy; Yau, C Lillian; McGee, Jennifer; Al-Abbas, Haythem; Amatya, Arun; Killackey, Mary; Slakey, Douglas",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0b013e3181ba343a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19935374/,164
103145,Scientists whose ideas came on the move.,2020-04-01,"BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to examine whether high-frequency ultrasound toothbrushes have different effects on oral hygiene. METHODS Fifty first-year dental hygiene students were randomly divided into three groups using ultrasound toothbrushes with different frequencies (1.6, 3.2, and 4.8 MHz) twice a day (3-min sessions) for 8 weeks. Plaque index (PlI) and gingival index (GI) scores were assessed at 4 and 8 weeks. RESULTS Changes in GI scores from baseline to 8 weeks tended to differ among the groups (p = 0.0862). The GI was significantly lower in the 3.2 and 4.8 MHz groups at 8 weeks (3.2 MHz group: p < 0.01, 4.8 MHz group: p < 0.05). At 4 weeks, the GI was significantly lower in the 3.2 MHz group (p < 0.05) and tended to be lower in the 4.8 MHz group (p = 0.07). The PlI was significantly lower in the 3.2 MHz group at 8 weeks (p < 0.01) and tended to be lower in the 1.6 and 4.8 MHz groups (1.6 MHz: p = 0.07, 4.8 MHz: p = 0.05). In addition, the PlI was significantly lower in the 4.8 MHz group at 4 weeks (p < 0.05). No significant differences in the changes in any measurements were observed among the groups. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study indicated that ultrasound toothbrushes with different frequencies probably have different effects on oral hygiene. However, it is difficult to conclude strongly that higher frequency ultrasound toothbrushes are more effective as there were some limitations.","Takenouchi, Akane; Otani, Etsuyo; Satoho, Yukiko; Kakegawa, Yumiko; Arai, Hiroe; Matsukubo, Takashi",International journal of dental hygiene,https://doi.org/10.1111/idh.12496; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763982/,164
103359,Vascular rejuvenation is geroprotective.,2021-07-30,"OBJECTIVE Kawasaki disease (KD) is a self-limited vasculitis affecting medium-sized vessels with a predilection for the coronary arteries. Although treatment reduces the likelihood of developing of coronary artery aneurysms, 5% of patients still develop aneurysms despite treatment, making KD the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in the United States. Consequently, there is a great deal of interest in optimizing treatment regimens, particularly for higher-risk patients, to decrease morbidity. The aim of this systematic review is to support the development of the American College of Rheumatology/Vasculitis Foundation for the diagnosis and management of KD, focusing on the more complex scenarios in which rheumatologists may become involved, such as high-risk and refractory disease. METHODS Eighty-nine articles were considered for full review in this systematic literature review to address 16 Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome questions related to KD. Data were abstracted in hierarchical fashion. Randomized control trials (RCTs) were considered first; if none were identified or if they contained insufficient information, comparative observational studies were then viewed, followed by single-arm observational studies/single arms from comparative studies. Only observational studies with more than 10 subjects with vasculitis were included. RESULTS Eight RCTs and 28 observational studies that addressed the questions were identified. Two questions were addressed by RCTs, seven questions had at least some comparative observational studies, three questions were only addressed by single-arm data, and four questions had no relevant studies. CONCLUSION This systematic review evaluates the benefits and harms of treatments for KD beyond first-line therapy.","James, Karen E; Kalot, Mohamad A; Husainat, Nedaa M; Dua, Anisha B; Byram, Kevin; Springer, Jason M; Lin, Yih Chang; Turgunbaev, Marat; Villa-Forte, Alexandra; Gorelik, Mark; Abril, Andy; Langford, Carol; Maz, Mehrdad; Chung, Sharon A; Mustafa, Reem A",ACR open rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/acr2.11308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34313406/,164
103931,Shiftworking keeps locked-down lab on track.,2020-04-01,"Background Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is regarded as an urgent clinical entity, and identification of differentially expressed genes, lncRNAs, and altered pathways shall provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms behind AMI. Materials and Methods Microarray data was collected to identify key genes and lncRNAs involved in AMI pathogenesis. The differential expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were employed to identify the upregulated and downregulated genes and pathways in AMI. The protein-protein interaction network and protein-RNA interaction analysis were utilized to reveal key long noncoding RNAs. Results In the present study, we utilized gene expression profiles of circulating endothelial cells (CEC) from 49 patients of AMI and 50 controls and identified a total of 552 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Based on these DEGs, we also observed that inflammatory response-related genes and pathways were highly upregulated in AMI. Mapping the DEGs to the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and identifying the subnetworks, we found that OMD and WDFY3 were the hub nodes of two subnetworks with the highest connectivity, which were found to be involved in circadian rhythm and organ- or tissue-specific immune response. Furthermore, 23 lncRNAs were differentially expressed between AMI and control groups. Specifically, we identified some functional lncRNAs, including XIST and its antisense RNA, TSIX, and three lncRNAs (LINC00528, LINC00936, and LINC01001), which were predicted to be interacting with TLR2 and participate in Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. In addition, we also employed the MMPC algorithm to identify six gene signatures for AMI diagnosis. Particularly, the multivariable SVM model based on the six genes has achieved a satisfying performance (AUC = 0.97). Conclusion In conclusion, we have identified key regulatory lncRNAs implicated in AMI, which not only deepens our understanding of the lncRNA-related molecular mechanism of AMI but also provides computationally predicted regulatory lncRNAs for AMI researchers.","Sheng, Xiaodong; Fan, Tao; Jin, Xiaoqi",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/1470867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083450/,164

Objective To examine long-term weight change and health status following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). Design, Setting, and Participants The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) study is a multicenter observational cohort study at 10 US hospitals in 6 geographically diverse clinical centers. Adults undergoing bariatric surgical procedures as part of clinical care between 2006 and 2009 were recruited and followed up until January 31, 2015. Participants completed presurgery, 6-month, and annual research assessments for up to 7 years. Main Outcome and Measures Percentage of weight change from baseline, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, determined by physical measures, laboratory testing, and medication use. Results Of 2348 participants, 1738 underwent RYGB (74%) and 610 underwent LAGB (26%). For RYBG, the median age was 45 years (range, 19-75 years), the median body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 47 (range, 34-81), 1389 participants (80%) were women, and 257 participants (15%) were nonwhite. For LAGB, the median age was 48 years (range, 18-78), the body mass index was 44 (range, 33-87), 465 participants (76%) were women, and 63 participants (10%) were nonwhite. Follow-up weights were obtained in 1300 of 1569 (83%) eligible for a year-7 visit. Seven years following RYGB, mean weight loss was 38.2 kg (95% CI, 36.9-39.5), or 28.4% (95% CI, 27.6-29.2) of baseline weight; between years 3 and 7 mean weight regain was 3.9% (95% CI, 3.4-4.4) of baseline weight. Seven years after LAGB, mean weight loss was 18.8 kg (95% CI, 16.3-21.3) or 14.9% (95% CI, 13.1-16.7), with 1.4% (95% CI, 0.4-2.4) regain. Six distinct weight change trajectory patterns for RYGB and 7 for LAGB were identified. Most participants followed trajectories in which weight regain from 3 to 7 years was small relative to year-3 weight loss, but patterns were variable. Compared with baseline, dyslipidemia prevalence was lower 7 years following both procedures; diabetes and hypertension prevalence were lower following RYGB only. Among those with diabetes at baseline (488 of 1723 with RYGB [28%]; 175 of 604 with LAGB [29%]), the proportion in remission at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years were 71.2% (95% CI, 67.0-75.4), 69.4% (95% CI, 65.0-73.8), 64.6% (95% CI, 60.0-69.2), and 60.2% (95% CI, 54.7-65.6), respectively, for RYGB and 30.7% (95% CI, 22.8-38.7), 29.3% (95% CI, 21.6-37.1), 29.2% (95% CI, 21.0-37.4), and 20.3% (95% CI, 9.7-30.9) for LAGB. The incidence of diabetes at all follow-up assessments was less than 1.5% for RYGB. Bariatric reoperations occurred in 14 RYGB and 160 LAGB participants. Conclusions and Relevance Following bariatric surgery, different weight loss patterns were observed, but most participants maintained much of their weight loss with variable fluctuations over the long term. There was some decline in diabetes remission over time, but the incidence of new cases is low following RYGB.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained. A total of 154 patients (85 men, 69 women; age range, 26-85 years; mean age, 67 years) who underwent biphasic (arterial and pancreatic phase) contrast material-enhanced CT performed with a 320-detector scanner were randomized into two groups: the 320-detector group and the 64-detector group. Biphasic transaxial multiplanar reformatted images and volume-rendered CT angiograms were obtained. CT numbers in the abdominal aorta, pancreas, and abdominal wall fat tissue; signal-to-noise ratio (SNR); and dose-length product (DLP) were compared. In addition, image quality and focal lesion depiction (n = 35) were qualitatively determined in the two groups. Unpaired t and Mann-Whitney tests were used for quantitative and qualitative assessment, respectively. RESULTS No significant difference in CT numbers of the abdominal aorta and pancreas was noted between the two groups. Mean DLP was 43% lower in the 320-detector group (675.4 mGy·cm) than in the 64-detector group (1187.8 mGy·cm) (P < .001). SNR of the abdominal aorta, pancreas, and abdominal wall fat on biphasic images was significantly lower in the 320-detector group than in the 64-detector group (P < .001). Image quality was acceptable in both groups and was slightly better in the 64-detector group for pancreatic phase axial images (P = .02) and arterial phase multiplanar reformatted images (P < .01). No significant difference was found in the depiction of pancreatic parenchyma, main pancreatic duct, focal pancreatic lesions, splanchnic arteries, or most of the small splanchnic arterial branches. CONCLUSION A 320-detector CT scan facilitates fast volumetric contrast-enhanced CT of the entire pancreas with acceptable image quality, even though SNR was significantly lower at 320-detector volumetric scanning.","Goshima, Satoshi; Kanematsu, Masayuki; Nishibori, Hironori; Sakurai, Kota; Miyazawa, Daisuke; Watanabe, Haruo; Kondo, Hiroshi; Shiratori, Yoshimune; Onozuka, Minoru; Moriyama, Noriyuki; Bae, Kyongtae T",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.11101459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21406629/,164

We conducted a systematic review of articles referenced in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Chinese Clinical Trial Register (ChiCTR) from December 20, 2019 to April 6, 2020, providing information on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in cornea, conjunctiva, lacrimal sac, and tears. We excluded ongoing clinical studies as for unobtainable conclusive results. Of 2422 articles, 11 met the inclusion criteria for analysis and were included in the study. None of the studies were multinational. Among the 11 selected papers there were three original articles, one review, four letters, two editorials, and one correspondence letter. Globally, 252 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were included in our review. The prevalence of ocular conjunctivitis complicating the course of COVID-19 was demonstrated to be as high as 32% in one study only. Globally, three patients had conjunctivitis with a positive tear-PCR, 8 patients had positive tear-PCR in the absence of conjunctivitis, and 14 had conjunctivitis with negative tear-PCR. The majority of the available data regarding SARS-CoV-2 colonization of ocular and periocular tissues and secretions have to be considered controversial. However, it cannot be excluded that SARS-CoV-2 could both infect the eye and the surrounding structures. SARS-CoV-2 may use ocular structure as an additional transmission route, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 patients' conjunctival secretion and tears positivity to reverse transcriptase-PCR SARS-CoV-2-RNA assay.","Aiello, Francesco; Gallo Afflitto, Gabriele; Mancino, Raffaele; Li, Ji-Peng Olivia; Cesareo, Massimo; Giannini, Clarissa; Nucci, Carlo",Eye,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-020-0926-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425362/,164

The combined effects of multiple guideline-recommended therapies in patients with symptomatic PAD have not been well characterized. METHODS AND RESULTS We analyzed a comprehensive database of all patients with claudication or critical limb ischemia (CLI) who underwent diagnostic or interventional lower-extremity angiography between June 1, 2006 and May 1, 2013 at a multidisciplinary vascular center. Baseline demographics, clinical data, and long-term outcomes were obtained. Inverse probability of treatment propensity weighting was used to determine the 3-year risk of major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (MACE; myocardial infarction, stroke, or death) and major adverse limb events (MALE; major amputation, thrombolysis, or surgical bypass). Among 739 patients with PAD, 325 (44%) had claudication and 414 (56%) had CLI. Guideline-recommended therapies at baseline included use of aspirin in 651 (88%), statin medications in 496 (67%), ACE inhibitors in 445 (60%), and smoking abstention in 528 (71%) patients. A total of 237 (32%) patients met all four guideline-recommended therapies. After adjustment for baseline covariates, patients adhering to all four guideline-recommended therapies had decreased MACE (hazard ratio [HR], 0.64; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.89; P=0.009), MALE (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.83; P=0.005), and mortality (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.82; P=0.003), compared to patients receiving less than four of the recommended therapies. CONCLUSIONS In patients with claudication or CLI, combination treatment with four guideline-recommended therapies is associated with significant reductions in MACE, MALE, and mortality.","Armstrong, Ehrin J; Chen, Debbie C; Westin, Gregory G; Singh, Satinder; McCoach, Caroline E; Bang, Heejung; Yeo, Khung-Keong; Anderson, David; Amsterdam, Ezra A; Laird, John R",Journal of the American Heart Association,https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.113.000697; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721799/,164

Several scores were developed to predict COVID-19 progression to critical disease and are often used among PWH. We assessed the performance of two commonly used risk equations among PWH and COVID-19. METHODS Participants were identified from a multicenter cohort of 6,361 PWH on regular follow-up at two university hospitals. Of 99 HIV-infected individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 63 had complete data and were included in this analysis. CALL and COVID-GRAM scores were calculated and participants were stratified into low, intermediate, and high-risk for each. Discrimination was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves. Calibration was evaluated using observed-versus-expected ratios and Hosmer-Lemeshow X2 goodness of fit statistic. Scores were adjusted by increasing one category level in individuals with nadir CD4 lymphocyte count <200/µL. RESULTS Participants had a median nadir and current CD4 counts of 207 (interquartile range, IQR, 119-345) and 440 (IQR 280-719) cells/µL. Ten (15.9%) individuals progressed to critical disease and 4 (6.3%) died. Assessed scores showed acceptable discrimination (area under the curve, 0.701-0.771) and were overall calibrated (observed-versus-expected ratio, O:E, 1.01). However, both overestimated the risk of progression among individuals in the low and high-risk categories, and underestimated the risk in the intermediate category (O:E 1.20-1.21). Thus, 50% of critically ill individuals were not identified as high-risk. Assigning PWH with low nadir CD4 count a higher risk of progression reduced the proportion of individuals not identified to 20%. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 risk scores had lower performance in PWH compared to that described in the general population and failed to adequately identify individuals who progressed to critical disease. Adjustment for nadir CD4 partially improved their accuracy. Risk equations incorporating HIV-related factors are needed.","Vizcarra, Pilar; Cabello, Alfonso; Moreno, Ana; Vivancos, María J; López-Botet, Javier; Zamarro, Belen; Górgolas, Miguel; Casado, Jose Luis",AIDS research and human retroviruses,https://doi.org/10.1089/aid.2021.0012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33913732/,164

The aim of this study was to assess the safety and curability of laparoscopic gastrectomy in elderly patients with gastric cancer compared with short- and long-term outcomes in non-elderly patients. METHODS We retrospectively investigated 386 patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer between January 2007 and December 2015 at the Digestive Disease Center, Showa University, Northern Yokohama Hospital. We categorized the patients into two groups by age: the elderly patients (≥ 75 years old) and the non-elderly patients (< 74 years old). Patient characteristics, clinicopathologic and operative findings, and short- and long-term outcomes were investigated and compared between the two groups. RESULTS The elderly group showed a significantly higher rate of comorbidities (73.1 vs. 49.2%, P < 0.001), and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores ≥ 2 (76.3 vs. 43.7%, P < 0.001), and using anticoagulant agents (25.8 vs. 7.9%, P < 0.001) than the non-elderly group. The postoperative morbidity and mortality did not differ between the two groups (19.4 vs. 18.8%; P = 0.880, 2.2 vs. 0%; P = 0.058). In the multivariate analysis, male sex was the only risk factor for postoperative morbidity after laparoscopic gastrectomy. However, age was not found to be a risk factor. The 5-year overall survival ratio was significantly lower in the elderly group than in the non-elderly group (67.7 vs. 85.0%; P < 0.001). However, the 5-year disease-specific survival ratio was similar in the two groups (84.8 vs. 89.1%; P = 0.071). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer could be safely performed in elderly patients with acceptable postoperative morbidity and curability.","Shimada, Shoji; Sawada, Naruhiko; Oae, Sonoko; Seki, Junichi; Takano, Yojiro; Ishiyama, Yasuhiro; Nakahara, Kenta; Maeda, Chiyo; Hidaka, Eiji; Ishida, Fumio; Kudo, Shin-Ei",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-018-6177-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29602987/,164

Many aspects of the current neonatal resuscitation guidelines remain controversial given the difficulties in conducting randomized clinical trials owing to the infrequent and often unpredictable need for extensive resuscitation. Most studies on neonatal resuscitation stem from manikin models that fail to truly reflect physiologic changes or piglet models that have cleared their lung fluid and that have completed the transition from fetal to neonatal circulation. The present protocol provides a detailed step-by-step description on how to create a perinatal asphyxiated fetal lamb model. The proposed model has a transitioning circulation and fluid-filled lungs, which mimics human newborns following delivery, and is, therefore, an excellent animal model to study newborn physiology. An important limitation to lamb experiments is the higher associated cost.","Vali, Payam; Gugino, Sylvia; Koenigsknecht, Carmon; Helman, Justin; Chandrasekharan, Praveen; Rawat, Munmun; Lakshminrusimha, Satyan; Nair, Jayasree",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/57553; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30175999/,164

Yet, we perceive vivid illusory motion in stationary, periodic luminance gradients that contain no true motion. This illusion is shared by diverse vertebrate species, but theories proposed to explain this illusion have remained difficult to test. Here, we demonstrate that in the fruit fly Drosophila, the illusory motion percept is generated by unbalanced contributions of direction-selective neurons' responses to stationary edges. First, we found that flies, like humans, perceive sustained motion in the stationary gradients. The percept was abolished when the elementary motion detector neurons T4 and T5 were silenced. In vivo calcium imaging revealed that T4 and T5 neurons encode the location and polarity of stationary edges. Furthermore, our proposed mechanistic model allowed us to predictably manipulate both the magnitude and direction of the fly's illusory percept by selectively silencing either T4 or T5 neurons. Interestingly, human brains possess the same mechanistic ingredients that drive our model in flies. When we adapted human observers to moving light edges or dark edges, we could manipulate the magnitude and direction of their percepts as well, suggesting that mechanisms similar to the fly's may also underlie this illusion in humans. By taking a comparative approach that exploits Drosophila neurogenetics, our results provide a causal, mechanistic account for a long-known visual illusion. These results argue that this illusion arises from architectures for motion detection that are shared across phyla.","Agrochao, Margarida; Tanaka, Ryosuke; Salazar-Gatzimas, Emilio; Clark, Damon A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2002937117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839324/,164

METHODS We used MSC as a novel candidate therapeutic tool in a pilot phase-I study for patients affected by progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a rare, severe and no-option form of Parkinsonism. Five patients received the cells by infusion into the cerebral arteries. Effects were assessed using the best available motor function rating scales (UPDRS, Hoehn and Yahr, PSP rating scale), as well as neuropsychological assessments, gait analysis and brain imaging before and after cell administration. RESULTS One year after cell infusion, all treated patients were alive, except one, who died 9 months after the infusion for reasons not related to cell administration or to disease progression (accidental fall). In all treated patients motor function rating scales remained stable for at least six-months during the one-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS We have demonstrated for the first time that MSC administration is feasible in subjects with PSP. In these patients, in whom deterioration of motor function is invariably rapid, we recorded clinical stabilization for at least 6 months. These encouraging results pave the way to the next randomized, placebo-controlled phase-II study that will definitively provide information on the efficacy of this innovative approach.

107802,News briefs.,2017,"The need for a vast quantity of new buildings to address the increase in population and living standards is opposed to the need for tackling global warming and the decline in biodiversity. To overcome this twofold challenge, there is a need to move towards a more circular economy by widely using a combination of alternative low-carbon construction materials, alternative technologies and practices. Soils or earth were widely used by builders before World War II, as a primary resource to manufacture materials and structures of vernacular architecture. Centuries of empirical practices have led to a variety of techniques to implement earth, known as rammed earth, cob and adobe masonry among others. Earth refers to local soil with a variable composition but at least containing a small percentage of clay that would simply solidify by drying without any baking. This paper discusses why and how earth naturally embeds high-tech properties for sustainable construction. Then the potential of earth to contribute to addressing the global challenge of modern architecture and the need to re-think building practices is also explored. The current obstacles against the development of earthen architecture are examined through a survey of current earth building practitioners in Western Europe. A literature review revealed that, surprisingly, only technical barriers are being addressed by the scientific community; two-thirds of the actual barriers identified by the interviewees are not within the technical field and are almost entirely neglected in the scientific literature, which may explain why earthen architecture is still a niche market despite embodying all the attributes of the best construction material to tackle the current climate and economic crisis.

Whether continuity of GP care influences experiences with, and barriers to, health care among young people is unknown. This paper explores the association between having a regular GP and experience of healthcare barriers and attitudes to health system navigation among young people in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. METHODS This study was a cross-sectional survey administered either online or face-to-face in community settings. Young people living in NSW were recruited, with oversampling of those from five socio-culturally marginalised groups (those who were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, homeless, of refugee background, in rural or remote locations, sexuality and/or gender diverse). In this analysis of a larger dataset, we examined associations between having a regular GP, demographic and health status variables, barriers to health care and attitudes to health system navigation, using chi-square tests and odds ratios. Content and thematic analyses were applied to free-text responses to explore young people's views about having a regular GP. RESULTS One thousand four hundred and sixteen young people completed the survey between 2016 and 2017. Of these, 81.1% had seen a GP in the previous 6 months and 57.8% had a regular GP. Cost was the most frequently cited barrier (45.8%) to accessing health care generally. Those with a regular GP were less likely to cite cost and other structural barriers, feeling judged, and not knowing which service to go to. Having a regular GP was associated with having more positive attitudes to health system navigation. Free-text responses provided qualitative insights, including the importance of building a relationship with one GP. CONCLUSIONS General practice is the appropriate setting for preventive health care and care coordination. Having a regular GP is associated with fewer barriers and more positive attitudes to health system navigation and may provide better engagement with and coordination of care. Strategies are needed to increase the proportion of young people who have a regular GP.","Kang, Melissa; Robards, Fiona; Luscombe, Georgina; Sanci, Lena; Usherwood, Tim",BMC family practice,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-020-01294-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33115430/,164

METHODS Ten male Landrace/Large White neonatal piglets were studied. Following anaesthesia and intubation, the animals were mechanically ventilated. Surgical procedures included catheterization of the right internal jugular vein and the carotid artery. After stabilization with 21% O(2), normocapnic hypoxia was induced by decreasing the inspired O(2) to 6-8%. When piglets developed bradycardia (heart rate < 60 beats/min), reoxygenation was initiated by administering 21% O(2). Arterial blood samples were taken during baseline, hypoxia and reoxygenation in order to measure interleukine-6 and interleukine-8. RESULTS Nine out of ten animals were successfully resuscitated (one of these required chest compressions and a dose of adrenaline) and one died despite resuscitation efforts. After returning to baseline haemodynamic values, euthanasia was performed using thiopental overdose. CONCLUSIONS Haemodynamic fluctuations at baseline, during normocapnic hypoxia and reoxygenation in Landrace/Large White piglets are comparable to that in human neonates, making the breed a favorable model of human neonatal hypoxia investigation.","Aroni, Filippia; Xanthos, Theodoros; Varsami, Marianna; Argyri, Ioanna; Alexaki, Avgoustina; Stroumpoulis, Konstantinos; Lelovas, Pavlos; Papalois, Apostolos; Faa, Gavino; Fanos, Vassillios; Iacovidou, Nicoletta","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.3109/14767058.2012.663823; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22489565/,164

It occurs mostly in people aged 40-50 years and 90% of the patients are female. FNH can be cured by local resection. How to locate and judge the tumor boundary in real time is often a challenge for surgeons. AIM To summarize the technique and feasibility of robotic resection of FNH guided by indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging. METHODS The demographics and perioperative outcomes of a consecutive series of patients who underwent robotic resection of liver FNH guided by ICG fluorescence imaging between May 1, 2018 and September 30, 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. ICG was injected through the median elbow vein in all the patients at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg 48 h before the operation. During the operation, the position of FNH in the liver was located in the fluorescence mode of the Da Vinci Si robot operating system and the tumor boundary was determined during the resection. RESULTS Among the 23 patients, there were 11 males and 12 females, with a mean age of 30.5 ± 9.3 years. Twenty-two cases completed robotic resection, while one (4.3%) case converted to open surgery. In the robotic surgery group, the operation time was 35-340 min with a median of 120 min, the intraoperative bleeding was 10-800 mL with a median of 50 mL, and the postoperative hospital stay was 1-7 d with a median of 4 d. Biliary fistula occurred in two (8.7%) patients after robotic operation and they both recovered after conservative treatment. One (4.3%) patient received blood transfusion and there was no death in this study. The postoperative hospital stay in the small tumor group was significantly shorter than that in the large tumor group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION ICG fluorescence imaging can guide the surgeon to perform robotic resection of liver FNH by locating the tumor and displaying the tumor boundary in real time. It is a safe and feasible method to ensure the complete resection of the tumor.","Li, Cheng-Gang; Zhou, Zhi-Peng; Tan, Xiang-Long; Wang, Zi-Zheng; Liu, Qu; Zhao, Zhi-Ming",World journal of gastrointestinal oncology,https://doi.org/10.4251/wjgo.v12.i12.1407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33362911/,164

However, mass testing in emergency department (ED) settings may result in crowded EDs and increase transmission risk for healthcare staff and other ED patients. Drive-through COVID-19 testing sites are an effective solution to quickly collect samples from suspected cases with minimal risk to healthcare personnel and other patients. Nevertheless, there are many logistical and operational challenges, such as shortages of testing kits, limited numbers of healthcare staff and long delays for collecting samples.

115233,Rethink economics to help marginalized people.,2020-06-10,"BACKGROUND Leaks after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) may be due to a mismatch between staple height and tissue thickness. The aim of this study was to determine the range of gastric thicknesses in three areas of stapling. METHODS SG was performed using a 40-Fr suction calibration system 4 cm from the pylorus. Measurement of combined gastric walls was accomplished with an applied pressure of 8 g/mm(2) on the fundus, midbody, and antrum. RESULTS We enrolled 26 SG patients (15 women, 11 men; mean age 36.8 years). Body mass index (BMI) averaged 45.3 kg/m(2) overall, 44.7 kg/m(2) for males and 45.7 kg/m(2) for females. Although male patients had a thicker stomach antrum than female patients (3.12 vs. 3.09 mm), the midbody (2.57 vs. 3.09 mm) and proximal areas (1.67 vs. 1.72 mm) were thicker in female patients. However, some maximum fundus thicknesses were up to 2.83 mm in females and 2.28 mm in males. Some antra were as thick as 4.07 mm in females and 5.39 mm in males. Also, men had a longer average staple line (22.95 vs. 19.90 cm). CONCLUSION Because of the range of gastric thicknesses, a single staple height cannot be used to appose the full range of gastric wall thicknesses without potentially causing necrosis or poor apposition. To help avoid leaks, a thickness calibration device is needed to determine correct staple height.","Huang, Rose; Gagner, Michel",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-015-1705-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26024735/,164

In this study, we investigated the QOL and symptoms after [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate ((177)Lu-octreotate) therapy in patients with inoperable or metastasized gastroenteropancreatic or bronchial neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). METHODS Two hundred sixty-five Dutch patients completed the QOL questionnaire of the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer after being treated for NETs. ANOVA was used for statistical analyses, with a P value of 0.05 or less being considered significant. Differences of at least 10 points in global health status (GHS)/QOL scores, symptom scores, and Karnofsky performance scores (KPS) before and after therapy were regarded as indicating an improvement. RESULTS Regardless of the treatment outcome, GHS/QOL, insomnia, appetite loss, and diarrhea improved significantly in the total group. These improvements were also seen in patients with bone metastases or a decrease of 50% or more in chromogranin A. Improvement in the scores by at least 10 points was also analyzed in a subgroup of patients with decreased GHS/QOL or symptoms at the start of therapy: in 36% of these patients, GHS/QOL improved after therapy; in 49%, fatigue; in 70%, nausea plus vomiting; in 53%, pain; in 44%, dyspnea; in 59%, insomnia; in 63%, appetite loss; in 60%, constipation; and in 67%, diarrhea. Additionally, we did not see a statistically significant deterioration in patients who had GHS/QOL 100, KPS 100, or no symptoms at the start. In patients with initial stable disease or remission after treatment, GHS/QOL and KPS decreased significantly when regrowth of the tumors occurred. CONCLUSION GHS/QOL, KPS, and symptoms improved significantly after (177)Lu-octreotate therapy, and there was no significant decrease in QOL in patients who had no symptoms before therapy. In patients who had suboptimal scores for GHS/QOL or symptoms before therapy, a clinically significant improvement was demonstrated. Our results indicate that (177)Lu-octreotate therapy not only reduces tumors and prolongs overall survival but also improves the patients' self-assessed QOL.","Khan, Saima; Krenning, Eric P; van Essen, Martijn; Kam, Boen L; Teunissen, Jaap J; Kwekkeboom, Dik J","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.111.087932; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21795361/,164

Objectives: To determine the incidence of thrombotic events and bleeding in patients with COVID-19 using the approved local thromboprophylaxis protocol. PATIENTS AND METHODS In 350 consecutive patients (median age 67 years) with confirmed COVID-19, treated in designated wards at a single center in Krakow, Poland from October 10, 2020, to April 30, 2021, we adapted a self-developed pharmacological thromboprophylaxis protocol based on clinical and laboratory risk assessment of thrombosis. We recorded in-hospital venous and arterial thromboembolic events, major or clinically relevant bleeding, and deaths along with other complications related to heparin administration. RESULTS Thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin was administered in 99.7% of patients, 57 (16 %) was treated in the intensive care unit. As many as 92% of patients followed the protocol for >85% of hospitalization time. Thromboembolic events occurred in 16 (4.4%) patients: venous thromboembolism (n=4, 1.1%), ischemic stroke (n=4, 1.1%), and myocardial infarction (n=8, 2.2%). Hemorrhagic complications were observed in 31 (9%) patients, including fatal bleeds (n=3, 0.9%). The overall mortality was 13.4%. The prophylactic, intermediate and therapeutic anticoagulation preventive strategies with heparin were not related to any of the outcomes. CONCLUSION Thromboprophylaxis protocol approved in our institution was associated with a relatively low risk of thromboembolism and bleeding, which provides additional evidence supporting the adoption of institutional strategies to improve outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Kolanko, Emanuel; Senderek, Tomasz; Prokop-Staszecka, Anna; Kruk, Aleksandra; Broniatowska, Elżbieta; Konieczyńska, Małgorzata; Kopiński, Piotr; Pudło, Joanna; Undas, Anetta",Polish archives of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.20452/pamw.16102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34605232/,164

METHODS Gasless multiport laparoscopic surgery or transumbilical laparoendoscopic single-site surgery was performed with securing of the surgical view by the abdominal wall-lift method. Intraoperative autologous blood salvage and donation was performed in cases associated with significant hemoperitoneum. RESULTS Six cases of ovarian bleeding with ruptured corpus luteal cyst, three cases of adnexal torsion with corpus luteal cyst, and one case each of ruptured heterotopic ampullary pregnancy and heterotopic tubal stump isthmic pregnancy after salpingectomy were managed. For ruptured corpus luteal cyst, hemostasis was achieved by removal of hematoma followed by suturing. For adnexal torsion, detorsion with cyst aspiration was performed in two cases and detorsion alone was performed in one case. For ruptured heterotopic ampullary pregnancy, unilateral salpingectomy was performed. For ruptured heterotopic tubal stump isthmic pregnancy after salpingectomy, removal of the expelled villous tissue followed by hemostatic coagulation was performed. In five cases associated with massive hemoperitoneum, intraoperative autologous blood salvage and donation were performed to avoid homologous blood transfusion. After surgery, seven live births were achieved, while two cases of biochemical pregnancy loss and a case of complete miscarriage were noted. CONCLUSION Although miscarriage could be a significant concern in the perioperative period, gasless laparoscopic surgery appeared to be feasible for management of acute adnexal disorders at less than 10 weeks of gestation.","Takeda, Akihiro; Hayashi, Shotaro; Imoto, Sanae; Sugiyama, Chisato; Nakamura, Hiromi",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,https://doi.org/10.1111/jog.12332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24689554/,164

The current study was undertaken to determine the clinically relevant 95% effective dose of intrathecal 2% hyperbaric prilocaine co-administered with sufentanil for scheduled cesarean section, using continual reassessment method. METHODS We conducted a dose-response, prospective, double-blinded study to determine the ED95 values of intrathecal hyperbaric prilocaine used with 2,5 mcg of sufentanil and 100 mcg of morphine for cesarean delivery. Each parturient enrolled in the study received an intrathecal dose of hyperbaric prilocaine determined by the CRM and the success or failure of the block was assessed as being the primary endpoint. RESULTS The doses given for each cohort varied from 35 to 50 mg of HP, according to the CRM, with a final ED95 lying between 45 and 50 mg of Prilocaine after completion of the 10 cohorts. Few side effects were reported and patients were globally satisfied. CONCLUSIONS The ED95 of intrathecal hyperbaric prilocaine with sufentanil 2.5 μg and morphine 100 μg for elective cesarean delivery was found to be between 45 and 50 mg.

The aim of this study was to assess if chronic seton drainage for patients with perianal Crohn's disease fistulas would result in less re-interventions, compared to anti-TNF and compared to surgical closure. METHODS This randomised trial was performed in 19 European centres. Patients with high perianal Crohn's fistulas with a single internal opening were randomly assigned to i) chronic seton drainage for 1 year, ii) anti-TNF therapy for 1 year, and iii) surgical closure after 2 months under a short course anti-TNF. The primary outcome was the cumulative number of patients with fistula-related re-intervention(s) at 1.5 year. Patients declining randomisation due to a specific treatment preference were included in a parallel prospective PISA registry cohort. RESULTS Between September 14, 2013 and November 20, 2017, 44 of the 126 planned patients were randomised. The study was stopped by the data safety monitoring board because of futility. Seton treatment was associated with the highest re-intervention rate (10/15, versus 6/15 anti-TNF and 3/14 surgical closure patients, P = 0.02). No substantial differences in perianal disease activity and quality of life between the three treatment groups were observed.

119747,Science and Government. Reforming China's S&T system.,2013,"CASE HISTORY A retrospective study was conducted to investigate 11 outbreaks of presumptive fatal adenovirus infection diagnosed through two New Zealand diagnostic laboratories during 2014 and 2015. Outbreaks occurred in 6-12-month-old Friesian or Friesian cross cattle during autumn, winter and spring. Individual outbreaks were short in duration, with mortality rates ranging from 3/250 to 20/600 (1.2 to 3.3%). CLINICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS Clinical signs included severe diarrhoea, depression, recumbency, and death. Post-mortem examination revealed congestion and oedema of the alimentary tract and fluid to haemorrhagic intestinal contents. Histopathological lesions were characterised by congestion and haemorrhage of the alimentary tract mucosa, oedema of the submucosa, and mild interstitial inflammation in the kidneys. Large basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies were identified in vascular endothelial cells of the alimentary tract in 11/11 cases and of the kidney in 8/9 cases. MOLECULAR TESTING A real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay was designed to detect bovine adenovirus type 10 (BAdV-10) using hexon gene sequences available in GenBank. DNA extracted from a field case and confirmed by sequencing was used as a positive control. The qPCR had a reaction efficiency of 101% (R(2)=0.99) and the limit of detection was <10 DNA copies/reaction. The qPCR detected BAdV-10 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from 10/11 cases. DNA sequencing of PCR products from nine of these cases showed them to be identical to BAdV-10 sequences in GenBank. For the PCR-negative case, the PCR product had a hexon sequence 99% similar to bovine adenovirus Wic isolate Ma20-1, a close relative of BadV-10. DIAGNOSIS Bovine adenovirus type 10 was identified in FFPE tissues from cattle with histopathological evidence of adenovirus infection. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Bovine adenoviruses, and especially BAdV-10, should be considered in the differential diagnosis for acute enteric disease and death in young cattle. The qPCR detected BAdV-10 from FFPE tissue of cattle with suspected adenoviral infection diagnosed by histopathology. However results should be interpreted in light of clinical and pathological findings due to the possibility of adenovirus shedding by healthy cattle and the presence of pathogenic adenoviruses other than BAdV-10.","Vaatstra, B L; Tisdall, D J; Blackwood, M; Fairley, R A",New Zealand veterinary journal,https://doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2016.1198280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27277320/,164
120486,Respiratory deposition model of an inhaled aerosol bolus.,2011,"UNLABELLED Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enteropathogenic coronavirus causing lethal watery diarrhea in piglets. Since 2010, a PEDV variant has spread rapidly in China, and it emerged in the United States in 2013, posing significant economic and public health concerns. The ability to circumvent the interferon (IFN) antiviral response, as suggested for PEDV, promotes viral survival and regulates pathogenesis of PEDV infections, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we show that PEDV-encoded 3C-like protease, nsp5, is an IFN antagonist that proteolytically cleaves the nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB) essential modulator (NEMO), an essential adaptor bridging interferon-regulatory factor and NF-κB activation. NEMO is cleaved at glutamine 231 (Q231) by PEDV, and this cleavage impaired the ability of NEMO to activate downstream IFN production and to act as a signaling adaptor of the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway. Mutations specifically disrupting the cysteine protease activity of PEDV nsp5 abrogated NEMO cleavage and the inhibition of IFN induction. Structural analysis suggests that several key residues outside the catalytic sites of PEDV nsp5 probably impact NEMO cleavage by modulating potential interactions of nsp5 with their substrates. These data show that PEDV nsp5 disrupts type I IFN signaling by cleaving NEMO. Previously, we and others demonstrated that NEMO is also cleaved by 3C or 3C-like proteinases of picornavirus and artertivirus. Thus, NEMO probably represents a prime target for 3C or 3C-like proteinases of different viruses. IMPORTANCE The continued emergence and reemergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) underscore the importance of studying how this virus manipulates the immune responses of its hosts. During coevolution with its hosts, PEDV has acquired mechanisms to subvert host innate immune responses for its survival advantage. At least two proteins encoded by PEDV have been identified as interferon (IFN) antagonists, papain-like protease (PLP) and N protein. Here, we report that the PEDV nsp5 gene, which encodes the 3C-like protease of PEDV, is another IFN antagonist. Mechanistically, the cysteine protease activity of PEDV nsp5 mediates proteolysis of NEMO, the key adaptor for IFN synthesis, and NEMO is cleaved at glutamine 231 (Q231). The new molecular details and determinants impacting NEMO scission by PEDV nsp5 delineated in this study are fundamental to our understanding of critical virus-host interactions that determine PEDV pathogenesis.","Wang, Dang; Fang, Liurong; Shi, Yanling; Zhang, Huan; Gao, Li; Peng, Guiqing; Chen, Huanchun; Li, Kui; Xiao, Shaobo",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02514-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26656704/,164

The high prevalence and malignant potential of NF-pNETs outline the need for an evidence-based screening program, as early diagnosis and timely intervention could reduce morbidity and mortality. Controversies exist regarding the value of several diagnostic tests. This systematic review aims to evaluate current literature and amplify an up-to-date evidence-based approach to NF-pNET diagnosis in MEN1. Three databases were systematically searched on the diagnostic value of biomarkers and imaging modalities. Twenty-seven studies were included and critically appraised (modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies). Another 12 studies, providing data on age-related penetrance and tumor growth, were included to assess the optimal frequency and timing of screening. Based on current literature, biomarkers should no longer play a role in the diagnostic process for NF-pNETs, as accuracies are too low. Studies evaluating the diagnostic value of imaging modalities are heterogeneous with varying risks of bias. For the detection of NF-pNETs, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has the highest sensitivity. A combined strategy of EUS and MRI seems to be the most useful. Gallium 68 octreotate-DOTA positron emission tomography-CT could be added if NF-pNETs are diagnosed to identify metastasis. Reported growth rates were generally low, and two distinct phenotypes were observed. Surveillance programs should focus on and be adapted to the presence of substantial growth in NF-pNETs. The optimal age to start screening must yet be determined, as insufficient evidence for an evidence-based recommendation was available.","van Treijen, Mark J C; van Beek, Dirk-Jan; van Leeuwaarde, Rachel S; Vriens, Menno R; Valk, Gerlof D",Journal of the Endocrine Society,https://doi.org/10.1210/js.2018-00087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30202829/,164

Mechanochemical ablation and radiofrequency ablation have no reported neurological side-effect but the rotating mechanism of mechanochemical ablation may produce microbubbles. Air emboli have been implicated as a cause of cerebrovascular events during ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy and microbubbles in the heart during ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy have been demonstrated. This study investigated the presence of microbubbles in the right heart during varicose vein ablation by mechanochemical abaltion and radiofrequency abaltion. Methods Patients undergoing great saphenous vein ablation by mechanochemical abaltion or radiofrequency ablation were recruited. During the ablative procedure, the presence of microbubbles was assessed using transthoracic echocardiogram. Offline blinded image quantification was performed using International Consensus Criteria grading guidelines. Results From 32 recruited patients, 28 data sets were analysed. Eleven underwent mechanochemical abaltion and 17 underwent radiofrequency abaltion. There were no neurological complications. In total, 39% (11/28) of patients had grade 1 or 2 microbubbles detected. Thirty-six percent (4/11) of mechanochemical abaltion patients and 29% (5/17) of radiofrequency ablation patients had microbubbles with no significant difference between the groups ( p=0.8065). Conclusion A comparable prevalence of microbubbles between mechanochemical abaltion and radiofrequency ablation both of which are lower than that previously reported for ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy suggests that mechanochemical abaltion may not confer the same risk of neurological events as ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy for treatment of varicose veins.","Moon, K H; Dharmarajah, B; Bootun, R; Lim, C S; Lane, Tra; Moore, H M; Sritharan, K; Davies, A H",Phlebology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0268355516661113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27511882/,164

METHODS We performed RARC on six patients with muscle-invasive or high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer starting in October 2011. During the same period, another five patients underwent LRC. Perioperative outcomes in initial experiences of RARC were elucidated by comparing them with those of LRC. RESULTS Robot-assisted procedures were completed in all cases without conversion to open surgery. The median time of pneumoperitoneum was 252 minutes, and the median blood loss was 340 mL. No severe complications were observed. Perioperative outcomes did not significantly differ between RARC and LRC. Although two cases of troubles in uretero-conduit anastomosis sites were observed after LRC, no patients experienced postoperative complication related to urinary diversion after RARC. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate that RARC is an acceptable option even in the initial period, and it may become one of the most favorable procedures for treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer in the near future, although more tests and longer follow-ups are required to confirm its effectiveness and safety.","Teishima, Jun; Hieda, Keisuke; Inoue, Shogo; Goto, Keisuke; Ikeda, Kenichiro; Ohara, Shinya; Kobayashi, Kanao; Kajiwara, Mitsuru; Matsubara, Akio",Innovations,https://doi.org/10.1097/imi.0000000000000056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25062101/,164

We first estimated the number of cattle that can be treated with a syringe or a can and then using the data of sales of these pinkeye medications and the total cattle population of Australia, estimated the incidence of pinkeye. Probability distributions were used to include uncertainty around the estimates. Costs to producers were estimated based on retail prices of these medications. The results indicated that 732,864 syringes of Orbenin® Eye Ointment, 134,800 syringes of Opticlox® Eye Ointment and 27,755 cans of Terramycin® Pinkeye Aerosol are sold in Australia per year. Based on some assumptions of the number of cases treated by these drugs and number of cases left untreated, the number of cattle affected by pinkeye each year in Australia was estimated to be 2.80 million (95 % PI: 1.76, 4.65) or 10.25 % (95 % PI: 6.43, 16.97) of the entire Australian cattle herd. The cattle industry is expected to lose AU$ 9.67 million (95 % PI: 8.56, 13.11) each year just considering the cost of these three drugs. The results suggest that losses due to pinkeye in the Australian cattle industry are considerably higher than previously thought and should be used to inform the development of disease prevention and control policies.","Kneipp, Mac; Govendir, Merran; Laurence, Michael; Dhand, Navneet K",Preventive veterinary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.105232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385616/,164
124941,The lockdown walk that inspired an experiment.,2020-07-09,"HYPOTHESIS The laparoscopic approach has become the gold standard for splenectomy despite the fact that the spleen is a solid organ located deep in the splenic fossa. There is currently a trend to reduce the invasiveness of minimally invasive procedures. Transabdominal or transumbilical single-incision laparoscopic (SILS) approaches are an alternative to natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery techniques, but no reports of their use have yet been published in relation to the spleen. AIM To describe the SILS technique for splenectomy in 2 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Two patients were approached by SILS, a 26-year-old male diagnosed of autoimmune thrombocytopenia and a 45-year-old male with recurrent Hodgkin disease. In both cases 3 trocars (1 of 12 mm and 2 of 5 mm) were inserted through the umbilicus in one and in a left subcostal in the other, and a curved transanal endoscopic microsurgery instrument, a flexible-tip 10-mm scope, and the UltraCision were introduced. Visualization of the spleen and standard dissection of attachments were feasible, and splenectomy was completed using transumbilicus stapling of the splenic hilum. The spleen was extracted through the umbilical incision, intact in one case and after morcellation in the other. RESULTS The postoperative course was uneventful. Both patients had minimal postoperative pain and scarring and were discharged on the second postoperative day. CONCLUSIONS SILS access can be safely used for operative visualization, hilum transection, and spleen removal with conventional instrumentation, reducing parietal wall trauma to a minimum. The clinical, esthetic, and functional advantages require further analysis.","Targarona, Eduardo M; Balague, Carmen; Martinez, Carmen; Pallares, Lluis; Estalella, Laia; Trias, Manuel",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350609353765; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20031948/,164

This shift provided an opportunity to identify limitations in the current healthcare infrastructure and how these may impact the health and well-being of persons with HD. OBJECTIVE The study objectives were to assess the feasibility of remote healthcare delivery in HD patients, to identify socioeconomic factors which may explain differences in feasibility and to evaluate the impact of safer-at-home orders on HD patient stress levels. METHODS This observational study of a clinical HD population during the 'safer-at-home' orders asked patients or caregivers about their current access to healthcare resources and patient stress levels. A chart review allowed for an assessment of socioeconomic status and characterization of HD severity. RESULTS Two-hundred and twelve HD patients were contacted with 156 completing the survey. During safer-at-home orders, the majority of HD patients were able to obtain medications and see a physician; however, 25% of patients would not commit to regular telehealth visits, and less than 50% utilized an online healthcare platform. We found that 37% of participants were divorced/single, 39% had less than a high school diploma, and nearly 20% were uninsured or on low-income health insurance. Patient stress levels correlated with disease burden. CONCLUSION A significant portion of HD participants were not willing to participate in telehealth services. Potential explanations for these limitations may include socioeconomic barriers and caregiving structure. These observations illustrate areas for clinical care improvement to address healthcare disparities in the HD community.","Pfalzer, Anna C; Hale, Lisa M; Huitz, Elizabeth; Buchanan, Danielle A; Brown, Brittany K; Moroz, Sarah; Rouleau, Renee M; Hay, Kaitlyn R; Hoadley, Jennifer; Laird, Amy; Ciriegio, Abagail E; Watson, Kelly H; Jones, Maile T; Lin, Ya-Chen; Kang, Hakmook; Riordan, Heather; Isaacs, David A; McDonell, Katherine; Compas, Bruce E; Claassen, Daniel O",Journal of Huntington's disease,https://doi.org/10.3233/jhd-200460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33896846/,164

However, the effect of HI-NPPV compared with spontaneous breathing (SB) on minute ventilation (MV) in patients receiving long-term treatment remains to be determined. This study compared MV during HI-NPPV and SB. In addition, the ability of intelligent volume assured pressure support (iVAPS) to increase MV to the same extent as HI-NPPV was determined. METHODS Daytime pneumotachographic measurements were performed during SB, HI-NPPV and iVAPS. RESULTS Twenty-seven stable hypercapnic COPD patients (mean FEV1 34 ± 15% predicted) who had been treated with HI-NPPV for a median of 22 months (interquartile range 8.5-84 months) were enrolled. Mean MV was 9.5 ± 1.7 L/min during SB and 12.1 ± 2.8 L/min during HI-NPPV, an increase of 2.5 L/min (95% CI [1.5-3.6] p < 0.001), or 26%. MV during iVAPS was 11.7 ± 3.6 L/min, an increase of 1.8 L/min (95%CI [0.7-3.0], p = 0.003) compared with SB. There was no difference in MV between HI-NPPV and iVAPS (p = 0.25). CONCLUSION Long-term HI-NPPV increased MV by an average of 26% compared with SB in stable hypercapnic COPD patients. A similar increase in MV was observed during use of iVAPS.","Ekkernkamp, Emelie; Kabitz, Hans-Joachim; Walker, David J; Schmoor, Claudia; Storre, Jan H; Windisch, Wolfram; Dreher, Michael",COPD,https://doi.org/10.3109/15412555.2013.829437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24111578/,164

Our study aimed to determine the point prevalence of viruses associated with exacerbations and evaluate clinical and investigational differences between virus-positive and -negative exacerbations in children with bronchiectasis. METHODS A cohort of 69 children (median age 7 years) with non-CF bronchiectasis was prospectively followed for 900 child-months. PCR for 16 respiratory viruses was performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates collected during 77 paediatric pulmonologist-defined exacerbations. Clinical data, systemic (C reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, procalcitonin, amyloid-A, fibrinogen) and lung function parameters were also collected. FINDINGS Respiratory viruses were detected during 37 (48%) exacerbations: human rhinovirus (HRV) in 20; an enterovirus or bocavirus in four each; adenoviruses, metapneumovirus, influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus 3 or 4 in two each; coronavirus or parainfluenza virus 1 and 2 in one each. Viral codetections occurred in 6 (8%) exacerbations. HRV-As (n=9) were more likely to be present than HRV-Cs (n=2). Children with virus-positive exacerbations were more likely to require hospitalisation (59% vs 32.5% (p=0.02)) and have fever (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2 to 11.1), hypoxia (OR 25.5, 95% CI 2.0 to 322.6), chest signs (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 10.2) and raised CRP (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.7 to 13.1) when compared with virus-negative exacerbations. INTERPRETATION Respiratory viruses are commonly detected during pulmonary exacerbations of children with bronchiectasis. HRV-As were the most frequently detected viruses with viral codetection being rare. Time-sequenced cohort studies are needed to determine the role of viral-bacterial interactions in exacerbations of bronchiectasis.","Kapur, Nitin; Mackay, Ian M; Sloots, Theo P; Masters, Ian B; Chang, Anne B",Archives of disease in childhood,https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2013-305147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819370/,164

126672,Wildlife consumption ban is insufficient.,2020-03-27,"PURPOSE The MAIA trial found that addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd) significantly prolonged progression-free survival in transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, compared with lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone (Rd). However, daratumumab is a costly treatment and is administered indefinitely until disease progression. Therefore, it is unclear whether it is cost-effective to use daratumumab in the first-line setting compared with reserving its use until later lines of therapy. METHODS We created a Markov model to compare healthcare costs and clinical outcomes of transplant-ineligible patients treated with daratumumab in the first-line setting compared with a strategy of reserving daratumumab until the second-line. We estimated transition probabilities from randomized trials using parametric survival modeling. Lifetime direct healthcare costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for first-line daratumumab versus second-line daratumumab from a US payer perspective. RESULTS First-line daratumumab was associated with an improvement of 0.52 QALYs and 0.66 discounted life-years compared with second-line daratumumab. While both treatment strategies were associated with considerable lifetime expenditures ($1,434,937 v $1,112,101 in US dollars), an incremental cost of $322,836 for first-line daratumumab led to an ICER of $618,018 per QALY. The cost of daratumumab would need to be decreased by 67% for first-line daratumumab to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 per QALY. CONCLUSION Using daratumumab in the first-line setting for transplant-ineligible patients may not be cost-effective under current pricing. Delaying daratumumab until subsequent lines of therapy may be a reasonable strategy to limit healthcare costs without significantly compromising clinical outcomes. Mature overall survival data are necessary to more fully evaluate cost-effectiveness in this setting.","Patel, Kishan K; Giri, Smith; Parker, Terri L; Bar, Noffar; Neparidze, Natalia; Huntington, Scott F",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.20.01849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411586/,164

However, there is a dearth of studies on the psychological resilience in residents. AIMS This study aims to measure the psychological resilience of Chinese residents to reflect their psychological status as well as influencing factors during the pandemic. METHOD We conducted a combination of stratified sampling and snowball sampling to select survey subjects. We employed the psychological resilience and influencing factor questionnaire based on the 10-item Connor and Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC10) for survey. We collected data from 3,398 residents in China between 31 January and 29 February 2020. Multivariable linear stepwise regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with psychological resilience in residents. RESULTS The mean score of psychological resilience among Chinese residents was 27.11 ± 8.45 (SD = 7.98). There were some factors significantly associated with psychological status among the Chinese residents during the COVID-19 outbreak. Residents with lower financial status, living in rural areas, unmarried, lacking fixed employment or retirement guarantees, and lacking knowledge of policies were more likely to report a lower level of psychological resilience. CONCLUSION Health service policy makers in many countries should adopt relevant measures to improve the psychological resilience of residents during the pandemic. This includes short-term aggressive treatment, strengthening health education, and improving the awareness of residents with respect to emergency health policies. In addition, the financial status, health levels, and risk management capabilities of residents should be increased over the long term.","Shen, Xin; Li, Yuting; Feng, Jing; Lu, Zuxun; Tian, Kunming; Gan, Yong",The International journal of social psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020980779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33300397/,164
128691,Where did COVID come from? Five mysteries that remain.,2021-02-26,"Some Authors recently suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) should be discontinued, even temporarily, given the current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The suggestion is based on the hypothesis that ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may favor the entry and diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus into the human cells. ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may increase the expression of ACE2 receptors, which are the sites of viral entry into the human organism. ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous, although they are extremely abundant on the cell surface of type 2 pneumocytes. Type 2 pneumocytes are small cylindrical alveolar cells located in close vicinity to pulmonary capillaries and responsible for the synthesis of alveolar surfactant, which is known to facilitate gas exchanges. The increased expression of ACE2 for effect of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs can be detected by increased production of angiotensin1-7 and mRNA related to ACE2. There is the fear that the increased expression of ACE2 induced by ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may ultimately facilitate the entry and diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, there is no clinical evidence to support this hypothesis. Furthermore, available data are conflicting and some counter-intuitive findings suggest that ARBs may be beneficial, not harmful. Indeed, studies conducted in different laboratories demonstrated that ACE2 receptors show a down-regulation (i.e. the opposite of what would happen with ACE-inhibitors and ARBs) for effect of their interaction with the virus. In animal studies, down-regulation of ACE2 has been found as prevalent in the pulmonary areas infected by virus, but not in the surrounding areas. In these studies, virus-induced ACE2 down-regulation would lead to a reduced formation of angiotensin1-7 (because ACE2 degrades angiotensin II into angiotensin1-7) with consequent accumulation of angiotensin II. The excess angiotensin II would favor pulmonary edema and inflammation, a phenomenon directly associated with angiotensin II levels, along with worsening in pulmonary function. Such detrimental effects have been blocked by ARBs in experimental models. In the light of the above considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that the suggestion to discontinue ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in all patients with the aim of preventing or limiting the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus is not based on clinical evidence. Conversely, experimental studies suggest that ARBs might be useful in these patients to limit pulmonary damage through the inhibition of type 1 angiotensin II receptors. Controlled clinical studies in this area are eagerly awaited. This review discusses facts and theories on the potential impact of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs in the setting of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Verdecchia, Paolo; Reboldi, Gianpaolo; Cavallini, Claudio; Mazzotta, Giovanni; Angeli, Fabio",Giornale italiano di cardiologia,https://doi.org/10.1714/3343.33127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32310915/,164

Here we describe the method and results of our technique of IOES in the supine position during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) using a guide wire cannulation (intraoperative supine endoscopic sphincterotomy by endoscopist-controlled guide wire cannulation) [ISEEG] technique). PATIENTS AND METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of the outcome for 36 patients undergoing LC with IOES (ISEEG technique) for acute biliary colic and jaundice with suspicion of choledocholithiasis. RESULTS On confirmation of CBD stones by intraoperative cholangiogram, CBD catheterization was successful in 34/36 (94.44%) patients with successful stone clearance in all of them by the ISEEG technique demonstrating 100% efficacy for stone clearance; the remaining 2 patients needed conversion to open surgery. The median time for the ISEEG technique during intraoperative sphincterotomy was 9 minutes (range, 7-23 minutes). Average hospital stay was 4.8 days (range, 2-15 days). At the 1-month follow-up, all patients were biliary symptom-free. Three of 36 patients (8.33%) had mild postoperative pancreatitis. There was no procedure-related mortality.

Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains the standard to determine the adequacy of clipping. Intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) angiography is increasingly utilized to confirm optimal clip positioning across the neck and to evaluate the adjacent vasculature. OBJECTIVE We evaluated the correlation between ICG and DSA in clipped intracranial aneurysms. METHODS A retrospective study of patients who underwent craniotomy and microsurgical clipping of intracranial aneurysms with ICG for 2 years. Patient characteristics, presentation details, operative reports, and pre- and postclipping angiographic images were reviewed to determine the adequacy of the clipping. RESULTS Forty-seven patients underwent clipping with ICG and postoperative DSA: 57 aneurysms were clipped; 23 patients (48.9%) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Nine aneurysms demonstrated a residual on DSA not identified on ICG (residual sizes ranged from 0.5 to 4.3 mm; average size: 1.8 mm). Postoperative DSA demonstrated no branch occlusions. CONCLUSION Intraoperative ICG is useful in the clipping of intracranial aneurysms to ensure a gross patency of branch vessels; however, the presence of residual aneurysms and subtle changes in flow in branch vessels is best seen by DSA. This has important clinical implications with regard to follow-up imaging and surgical/endovascular management.","Doss, Vinodh T; Goyal, Nitin; Humphries, William; Hoit, Dan; Arthur, Adam; Elijovich, Lucas",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000381148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26279659/,164
130102,Is this telescope-on-a-plane worth its pricetag?,2020-04-10,"The airway epithelium acts as a frontline defense against respiratory viruses, not only as a physical barrier and through the mucociliary apparatus but also through its immunological functions. It initiates multiple innate and adaptive immune mechanisms which are crucial for efficient antiviral responses. The interaction between respiratory viruses and airway epithelial cells results in production of antiviral substances, including type I and III interferons, lactoferrin, β-defensins, and nitric oxide, and also in production of cytokines and chemokines, which recruit inflammatory cells and influence adaptive immunity. These defense mechanisms usually result in rapid virus clearance. However, respiratory viruses elaborate strategies to evade antiviral mechanisms and immune responses. They may disrupt epithelial integrity through cytotoxic effects, increasing paracellular permeability and damaging epithelial repair mechanisms. In addition, they can interfere with immune responses by blocking interferon pathways and by subverting protective inflammatory responses toward detrimental ones. Finally, by inducing overt mucus secretion and mucostasis and by paving the way for bacterial infections, they favor lung damage and further impair host antiviral mechanisms.","Vareille, Marjolaine; Kieninger, Elisabeth; Edwards, Michael R; Regamey, Nicolas",Clinical microbiology reviews,https://doi.org/10.1128/cmr.00014-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21233513/,164

Nevertheless, the role and mechanism of exosomal miR-638 in HCC development remain largely unknown. Methods Exosomes were isolated and confirmed via transmission electron microscopy and western blot. The abundances of miR-638 and specificity protein 1 (SP1) were measured via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or western blot. Cell proliferation was investigated by Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation assay, apoptosis, cell cycle distribution and related protein expression. Cell migration and invasion were detected via transwell assay and western blot. Co-culture experiment was performed to assess exosome transfer from HCC cells to endothelial cells. The target correlation between miR-638 and SP1 was analyzed via dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. The subcutaneous xenograft experiment was conducted to test the function of miR-638 in vivo. Results The miR-638 level declined in exosomes from serum or HCC cell medium. miR-638 overexpression repressed HCC cell proliferation by decreasing viability and colony formation and inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, and decreased abilities of migration and invasion. Exosomal miR-638 from HCC cells could transfer to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and suppress HUVEC proliferation, migration and invasion. SP1 was a target of miR-638 and overexpression of SP1 reversed the effect of miR-638 on HCC cells. Overexpression of miR-638 reduced xenograft tumor growth via decreasing SP1. Conclusion Exosomal miR-638 inhibited HCC tumorigenesis by targeting SP1.

A cumulative risk index on oxytocin-pathway genes was constructed by combining single nucleotide polymorphisms on five genes previously linked with social deficits and psychopathology; OXTR rs1042778, OXTR rs2254298, OXTRrs53576, CD38 rs3796863, and AVPR1A RS3. Avoidant response to trauma reminders in early childhood and anxiety disorders in late childhood were assessed as predictors of disruptions to DMN theta connectivity. Results: Higher vulnerability on oxytocin-pathway genes predicted greater disruptions to DMN theta connectivity. Avoidant symptoms in early childhood and generalized anxiety disorder in later childhood were related to impaired DMN connectivity. In combination, stress exposure, oxytocin-pathway genes, and stress-related symptoms explained 24.6% of the variance in DMN connectivity, highlighting the significant effect of stress on the maturing brain. Conclusions: Findings are the first to link the oxytocin system and maturation of the DMN, a core system sustaining autobiographical memories, alteration of intrinsic and extrinsic attention, mentalization, and sense of self. Results suggest that oxytocin may buffer the effects of chronic early stress on the DMN, particularly theta rhythms that typify the developing brain.","Zeev-Wolf, Maor; Levy, Jonathan; Ebstein, Richard P; Feldman, Ruth",Frontiers in endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.00335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32528417/,164
131447,Coronavirus lockdown: What I learnt when I shut my cancer lab in 48 hours.,2020-03-19,"BACKGROUND Foot ulcers in people with diabetes are a prevalent and serious global health issue. Dressings form a key part of ulcer treatment, with clinicians and patients having many different types to choose from including hydrogel dressings. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing use. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of hydrogel wound dressings compared with alternative dressings or none on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. SEARCH METHODS For this first update, in April 2013, we searched the following databases the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that have compared the effects on ulcer healing of hydrogel with alternative wound dressings or no dressing in the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS We included five studies (446 participants) in this review. Meta analysis of three studies comparing hydrogel dressings with basic wound contract dressings found significantly greater healing with hydrogel: risk ratio (RR) 1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 2.56. The three pooled studies had different follow-up times (12 weeks, 16 weeks and 20 weeks) and also evaluated ulcers of different severities (grade 3 and 4; grade 2 and grade unspecified). One study compared a hydrogel dressing with larval therapy and found no statistically significant difference in the number of ulcers healed and another found no statistically significant difference in healing between hydrogel and platelet-derived growth factor. There was also no statistically significant difference in number of healed ulcers between two different brands of hydrogel dressing. All included studies were small and at unclear risk of bias and there was some clinical heterogeneity with studies including different ulcer grades. No included studies compared hydrogel with other advanced wound dressings. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is some evidence to suggest that hydrogel dressings are more effective in healing (lower grade) diabetic foot ulcers than basic wound contact dressings however this finding is uncertain due to risk of bias in the original studies. There is currently no research evidence to suggest that hydrogel is more effective than larval therapy or platelet-derived growth factors in healing diabetic foot ulcers, nor that one brand of hydrogel is more effective than another in ulcer healing. No RCTs comparing hydrogel dressings with other advanced dressing types were found.","Dumville, Jo C; O'Meara, Susan; Deshpande, Sohan; Speak, Katharine",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd009101.pub3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23846869/,164

The preference for one device over another is based on a combination of factors, including the surgeon's subjective experience, availability, and cost. Although comparative clinical studies and meta-analyses of laparoscopic energy sources have reported small but statistically significant differences in volumes of blood loss, the clinical significance of such small volumes is questionable. The overall usefulness of the various energy sources available will depend on a number of factors including vessel burst pressure and seal time, lateral thermal spread, and smoke production. Animal studies and laboratory-based trials are useful in providing a controlled environment to investigate such parameters. At present, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of one energy source over another.","Law, Kenneth S K; Lyons, Stephen D",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2013.01.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23659751/,164

Contact transfer and reaerosolization of collected microbes from used respirators are also a concern. An option to address these potential problems is UV irradiation, which inactivates microbes by dimerizing thymine/uracil in nucleic acids. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of transmission mode and environmental conditions on decontamination efficiency by UV. In this study, filters were contaminated by different transmission pathways (droplet and aerosol) using three spraying media (deionized water [DI], beef extract [BE], and artificial saliva [AS]) under different humidity levels (30% [low relative humidity {LRH}], 60% [MRH], and 90% [HRH]). UV irradiation at constant intensity was applied for two time intervals at each relative humidity condition. The highest inactivation efficiency (IE), around 5.8 logs, was seen for DI aerosols containing MS2 on filters at LRH after applying a UV intensity of 1.0 mW/cm(2) for 30 min. The IE of droplets containing MS2 was lower than that of aerosols containing MS2. Absorption of UV by high water content and shielding of viruses near the center of the aggregate are considered responsible for this trend. Across the different media, IEs in AS and in BE were much lower than in DI for both aerosol and droplet transmission, indicating that solids present in AS and BE exhibited a protective effect. For particles sprayed in a protective medium, RH is not a significant parameter.","Woo, Myung-Heui; Grippin, Adam; Anwar, Diandra; Smith, Tamara; Wu, Chang-Yu; Wander, Joseph D",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.00465-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22685135/,164

The Flow-Redirection Endoluminal Device system is a dual-layer flow-diversion device. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the Flow-Redirection Endoluminal Device in a sidewall aneurysm model and in the abdominal aorta in rabbits. MATERIALS AND METHODS Single Flow-Redirection Endoluminal Devices were implanted in the right common carotid artery across sidewall, vein-pouch aneurysms and within the abdominal aorta in 22 New Zealand white rabbits and followed for 1 (n = 5), 3 (n = 5), 6 (n = 4), and 12 months (n = 8). Aneurysm occlusion was graded on a 3-point scale based on digital subtraction angiography (grade I, complete occlusion; grade II, near-complete occlusion; and grade III, incomplete occlusion). Toluidine blue and basic fuchsin staining was used for the evaluation of thrombus organization within the aneurysm and neck coverage with neointima. A scanning electron microscope was used for confirmation of the patency of branch vessels along with DSA. RESULTS Grades I and II occlusion rates were noted in 19 (86%) and 3 (14%) aneurysms, respectively, which indicated a 100% rate of complete or near-complete occlusion. No parent artery and branch artery occlusion was shown on DSA. Histologic images indicated partial or complete intraluminal thrombus organization and neointima coverage across the aneurysm neck. A scanning electron microscope indicated that all the vessel branches along the length of the device remained patent. CONCLUSIONS The Flow-Redirection Endoluminal Device in experimental aneurysms demonstrated high rates of progressive and complete aneurysm occlusion while preserving the patency of branch vessels.","Ding, Y H; Tieu, T; Kallmes, D F",AJNR.

136792,Scientists criticize use of unproven COVID drugs in India.,2020-11-09,"BACKGROUND The shrinkage of mesh has been cited as a possible explanation for hernia recurrence. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) is unique in that it can be visualized on computed tomography (CT). Some animal studies have shown a greater than 40% rate of contraction of ePTFE; however, very few human studies have been performed. STUDY DESIGN A total of 815 laparoscopic incisional/ventral hernia (LIVH) repairs were performed by a single surgical group. DualMesh Plus (ePTFE) (WL Gore & Associates, Newark, DE) was placed in the majority of these patients using both transfascial sutures and tack fixation. Fifty-eight patients had postoperative CTs of the abdomen and pelvis with ePTFE and known transverse diameter of the implanted mesh. The prosthesis was measured on the CT using the AquariusNet software program (TeraRecon, San Mateo, CA), which outlines the mesh and calculates the total length. Data were collected regarding the original mesh size, known linear dimension of mesh, seroma formation, and time interval since mesh implantation in months. RESULTS The mean shrinkage rate was 6.7%. The duration of implantation ranged from 6 weeks to 78 months, with a median of 15 months. Seroma was seen in 8.6% (5) of patients. No relationship was identified between the percentage of shrinkage and the original mesh size (P = 0.78), duration of time implanted (P = 0.57), or seroma formation (P = 0.074). In 27.5% (16) of patients, no shrinkage of mesh was identified. Of the patients who did experience mesh shrinkage, the range of shrinkage was 2.6-25%. CONCLUSIONS Our results are markedly different from animal studies and show that ePTFE has minimal shrinkage after LIVH repair. The use of transfascial sutures in addition to tack fixation may have an implication on the mesh contraction rates.","Carter, P R; LeBlanc, K A; Hausmann, M G; Whitaker, J M; Rhynes, V K; Kleinpeter, K P; Allain, B W",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-011-0898-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22169984/,164

The first such instance was apparently the encephalitis lethargica pandemic which arose around the time of the First World War, moving in the shadow of a repiratory virus pandemic. The epidemic of encephalitis lethargica (EL), or Von Economo's Disease, in the years 1917-27 was the first pandemic involving the central nervous system. It moved in some places in parallel with the Great Flu Pandemic but does not seem to have been caused by it. Unlike the coronavirus, pandemic EL affected children heavily, leading often to bizarre changes in character and personality. It often left sequelae lasting for decades in the form of postencephalitic Parkinsonism (PEP). Unlike the coronavirus, it had a high mortality of around 20 percent. Although encephalitis lethargica involved a number of systems, psychiatric morbidity was most prominent and entailed severe depression, mania, catatonia and psychosis. It ended without therapeutic or public-health measures; today, sporadic cases of EL continue to be reported. The hypothesis is that we can derive from the EL psychiatric pandemic certain lessons that might be useful in studying tardive COVID symptoms today.","Shorter, Edward",Medical hypotheses,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33268001/,164

A series of patient speakers and integrated simulation activities focused on underserved populations (i.e., the Patient Voices series) was embedded into a pharmacy skills laboratory curriculum. First professional year (P1) student self-ratings of confidence were compared on pre- and post-course surveys. Using evaluations from P1 introductory pharmacy practice experience (IPPE) rotations, student self-evaluation data were compared to preceptor evaluations of student performance. Open-ended responses to course evaluations (from first- and second-year PharmD students) and student reflections (from third-year PharmD students) were assessed using conventional content analysis to identify and characterize student perceptions.Results. Statistically significant increases were observed in P1 students' confidence to show empathy (mean, 4.22 to 4.70) and to interact with patients from underserved communities (mean, 2.24 to 4.22). Preceptor data on empathy was consistent with students' self-rated abilities, while student self-ratings on cultural sensitivity were higher. Qualitative analysis of course evaluation surveys and reflections revealed common themes identified by students such as understanding different perspectives, increased empathy for patients, and the value of including this content in the curriculum.Conclusion.

139155,Coronapod: The heavy toll on people of colour.,2020-06-05,"Blood vessel damage resulting from trauma or diseases presents a serious risk of morbidity and mortality. Although synthetic vascular grafts have been successfully commercialized for clinical use, they are currently only readily available for large-diameter vessels (>6 mm). Small-diameter vessel (<6 mm) replacements, however, still present significant clinical challenges worldwide. The primary objective of this study is to create novel, tunable, small-diameter blood vessels with biomimetic two distinct cell layers [vascular endothelial cell (VEC) and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)] using an advanced coaxial 3D-bioplotter platform. Specifically, the VSMCs were laden in the vessel wall and VECs grew in the lumen to mimic the natural composition of the blood vessel. First, a novel bioink consisting of VSMCs laden in gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)/polyethylene(glycol)diacrylate/alginate and lyase was designed. This specific design is favorable for nutrient exchange in an ambient environment and simultaneously improves laden cell proliferation in the matrix pore without the space restriction inherent with substance encapsulation. In the vessel wall, the laden VSMCs steadily grew as the alginate was gradually degraded by lyase leaving more space for cell proliferation in matrices. Through computational fluid dynamics simulation, the vessel demonstrated significantly perfusable and mechanical properties under various flow velocities, flow viscosities, and temperature conditions. Moreover, both VSMCs in the scaffold matrix and VECs in the lumen steadily proliferated over time creating a significant two-cell-layered structure. Cell proliferation was confirmed visually through staining the markers of alpha-smooth muscle actin and cluster of differentiation 31, commonly tied to angiogenesis phenomena, in the vessel matrices and lumen, respectively. Furthermore, the results were confirmed quantitatively through gene analysis which suggested good angiogenesis expression in the blood vessels. This study demonstrated that the printed blood vessels with two distinct cell layers of VECs and VSMCs could be potential candidates for clinical small-diameter blood vessel replacement applications.","Zhou, Xuan; Nowicki, Margaret; Sun, Hao; Hann, Sung Yun; Cui, Haitao; Esworthy, Timothy; Lee, James D; Plesniak, Michael; Zhang, Lijie Grace",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c14871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006880/,164

The very rare cases of dissociated crossed speech areas were accidentally found based on the clinical symptomatology. Today functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based imaging can be employed to non-invasively localise the eloquent areas in brain tumour patients for therapy planning. A 41-year-old, left-handed man with a low-grade glioma in the left frontal operculum extending to the insular cortex, tension headaches, and anomic aphasia over 5 months underwent a pre-operative speech area localisation fMRI measurement, which revealed the evidence of the transhemispheric disposition, where the dominant Wernicke speech area is located on the left and the Broca's area is strongly lateralised to the right hemisphere. The outcome of the Wada test and the intraoperative cortico-subcortical stimulation mapping were congruent with this finding. After tumour removal, language area function was fully preserved. Upon the occurrence of brain tumours with a risk of impaired speech function, the rare dissociate crossed speech areas disposition may gain a clinically relevant meaning by allowing for more extended tumour removal.

The primary outcome of interest was the incidence of facial PIs. The secondary outcomes of interest were facial pain while wearing PPE and ease of use of the care bundle. METHODS This study used a voluntary survey by questionnaire, supplemented by a qualitative analysis of interviews from a small purposive sample that took place in one large Irish hospital over a two-month period in 2020. The hospital was a city-based public university teaching hospital with 800 inpatient beds. The intervention was a care bundle consisting of skin protection, face mask selection, material use, skin inspection, cleansing and hydration developed in line with international best practice guidelines. All staff working in COVID-19 wards, intensive care units and the emergency department in the hospital were given a kitbag containing the elements of the care bundle plus an information pamphlet. Data were collected via a survey and interviews. RESULTS A total of 114 staff provided feedback on the use of the care bundle. Before using the care bundle 29% (n=33) of the respondents reported developing a facial PI, whereas after using the care bundle only 8% (n=9) of the respondents reported developing a facial PI. The odds ratio (OR) of skin injury development was 4.75 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.15-10.49; p=0.0001), suggesting that after the care bundle was issued, those who responded to the survey were almost five times less likely to develop a skin injury. Interviews with 14 staff determined that the bundle was easy to use and safe. CONCLUSION Among those who responded to the survey, the use of the bundle was associated with a reduction in the incidence of skin injury from 29% to 8%, and respondents found the bundle easy to use, safe and effective. As with evidence from the international literature, this study has identified that when skincare is prioritised, and a systematic preventative care bundle approach is adopted, there are clear benefits for the individuals involved.","Moore, Zena; McEvoy, Natalie L; Avsar, Pinar; McEvoy, Linda; Curley, Gerard; O'Connor, Tom; Budri, Aglecia; Nugent, Linda; Walsh, Simone; Bourke, Frank; Patton, Declan",Journal of wound care,https://doi.org/10.12968/jowc.2021.30.3.162; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729846/,164

Methods A systematic review without a meta-analysis was performed of studies in four electronic databases (Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus) that used the ETDQ-7 and at least one objective measure of OETD. Results Six-hundred and fifty-two studies were identified in the initial literature search. Abstracts from 337 studies were screened, followed by full-text review of 61 studies, and qualitative synthesis of 12 studies. Tympanometry was used as an objective measure in ten studies. Eight of the 12 included studies had patient cohort selection bias. Eight studies administered the ETDQ-7 in cohorts of patients with or without OETD, already confirmed on tympanometry, and found a sensitivity of 91%-100% and specificity of 67%-100%. Four studies administered the ETDQ-7 to patients who had not previously undergone objective testing and found a sensitivity of 49%-80% and specificity of 24%-78%. Conclusions The ETDQ-7 is an important patient-reported outcome measure. However, based upon existing literature, the ETDQ-7 appears limited as a diagnostic tool for OETD or as an objective measure of Eustachian tube function.","Andresen, Nicholas S; Sharon, Jeffrey D; Nieman, Carrie L; Seal, Stella M; Ward, Bryan K",Laryngoscope investigative otolaryngology,https://doi.org/10.1002/lio2.606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34401511/,164
142199,Letter from Japan.,2020-12-02,"BACKGROUND Identification of risk factors for poor prognosis of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is necessary to enable the risk stratification and modify the patient's management. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the in-hospital mortality and risk factors of death in COVID-19 patients. METHODS All studies were searched via the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP, and Wanfang databases. The in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients was pooled. Odds ratios (ORs) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for evaluation of risk factors. RESULTS A total of 80 studies were included with a pooled in-hospital mortality of 14% (95% CI: 12.2- 15.9%). Older age (MD =13.32, 95% CI: 10.87-15.77; P<0.00001), male (OR =1.66, 95% CI: 1.37-2.01; P<0.00001), hypertension (OR =2.67, 95% CI: 2.08-3.43; P<0.00001), diabetes (OR =2.14, 95% CI: 1.76-2.6; P<0.00001), chronic respiratory disease (OR =3.55, 95% CI: 2.65-4.76; P<0.00001), chronic heart disease/cardiovascular disease (OR =3.15, 95% CI: 2.43-4.09; P<0.00001), elevated levels of high-sensitive cardiac troponin I (MD =66.65, 95% CI: 16.94-116.36; P=0.009), D-dimer (MD =4.33, 95% CI: 2.97-5.68; P<0.00001), C-reactive protein (MD =48.03, 95% CI: 27.79-68.27; P<0.00001), and a decreased level of albumin at admission (MD =-3.98, 95% CI: -5.75 to -2.22; P<0.0001) are associated with higher risk of death. Patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR =62.85, 95% CI: 29.45-134.15; P<0.00001), acute cardiac injury (OR =25.16, 95% CI: 6.56-96.44; P<0.00001), acute kidney injury (OR =22.86, 95% CI: 4.60-113.66; P=0.0001), and septic shock (OR =24.09, 95% CI: 4.26-136.35; P=0.0003) might have a higher in-hospital mortality.

While existing works focus on CT scans, this paper studies the application of DL techniques for the analysis of lung ultrasonography (LUS) images. Specifically, we present a novel fully-annotated dataset of LUS images collected from several Italian hospitals, with labels indicating the degree of disease severity at a frame-level, videolevel, and pixel-level (segmentation masks). Leveraging these data, we introduce several deep models that address relevant tasks for the automatic analysis of LUS images. In particular, we present a novel deep network, derived from Spatial Transformer Networks, which simultaneously predicts the disease severity score associated to a input frame and provides localization of pathological artefacts in a weakly-supervised way. Furthermore, we introduce a new method based on uninorms for effective frame score aggregation at a video-level. Finally, we benchmark state of the art deep models for estimating pixel-level segmentations of COVID-19 imaging biomarkers. Experiments on the proposed dataset demonstrate satisfactory results on all the considered tasks, paving the way to future research on DL for the assisted diagnosis of COVID-19 from LUS data.","Roy, Subhankar; Menapace, Willi; Oei, Sebastiaan; Luijten, Ben; Fini, Enrico; Saltori, Cristiano; Huijben, Iris; Chennakeshava, Nishith; Mento, Federico; Sentelli, Alessandro; Peschiera, Emanuele; Trevisan, Riccardo; Maschietto, Giovanni; Torri, Elena; Inchingolo, Riccardo; Smargiassi, Andrea; Soldati, Gino; Rota, Paolo; Passerini, Andrea; Van Sloun, Ruud J G; Ricci, Elisa; Demi, Libertario",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2020.2994459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32406829/,164
143508,Rapid and frequent testing.,2020-12-01,"In late-phase confirmatory clinical trials in the oncology field, time-to-event (TTE) endpoints are commonly used as primary endpoints for establishing the efficacy of investigational therapies. Among these TTE endpoints, overall survival (OS) is always considered as the gold standard. However, OS data can take years to mature, and its use for measurement of efficacy can be confounded by the use of post-treatment rescue therapies or supportive care. Therefore, to accelerate the development process and better characterize the treatment effect of new investigational therapies, other TTE endpoints such as progression-free survival and event-free survival (EFS) are applied as primary efficacy endpoints in some confirmatory trials, either as a surrogate for OS or as a direct measure of clinical benefits. For evaluating novel treatments for acute myeloid leukemia, EFS has been gradually recognized as a direct measure of clinical benefits. However, the application of an EFS endpoint is still controversial mainly due to the debate surrounding definition of treatment failure (TF) events. In this article, we investigate the EFS endpoint with the most conservative definition for the timing of TF, which is Day 1 since randomization. Specifically, the corresponding non-proportional hazard pattern of the EFS endpoint is investigated with both analytical and numerical approaches.","Xu, Tu; Zhang, Yiming; Goldwasser, Meredith; Zhang, Vickie",Pharmaceutical statistics,https://doi.org/10.1002/pst.2103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594827/,164

Recent statistics indicates that about half of the western population, sensitive to this discussion, would be in favor of animal testing while the other half would oppose it. Here, outlining scientific, historical, ethical, and philosophical aspects, we provide an integrated view explaining the reasons why biomedical research can hardly abandon laboratory animal testing. In this paper, we retrace the historical moments that mark the relationship between humans and other animal species. Then starting from Darwin's position on animal experimentation, we outline the steps that over time allowed the introduction of laws and rules that regulate animals' use in biomedical research. In our analysis, we present the perspectives of various authors, with the aim of delineating a theoretical framework within which to insert the ethical debate on laboratory animals research. Through the analysis of fundamental philosophical concepts and some practical examples, we propose a view according to which laboratory animals experimentation become ethically acceptable as far as it is guided by the goal of improving humans and other animal species (i.e., pets) life. Among the elements analyzed, there is the concept of responsibility that only active moral subjects (humans) have towards themselves and towards passive moral subjects (other animal species). We delineate the principle of cruelty that is useful to understand why research in laboratory animals should not be assimilated to a cruel act. Moreover, we touch upon the concepts of necessity and ""good cause"" to underline that, if biomedical research would have the possibility to avoid using animals, it would surely do that. To provide an example of the negative consequences occurring from not allowing laboratory animal research, we analyze the recent experience of Covid-19 epidemic. Finally, recalling the principle of ""heuristics and biases"" by Kahneman, we discuss why scientists should reconsider the way they are conveying information about their research to the general public.","Petetta, Francesca; Ciccocioppo, Roberto",Addiction biology,https://doi.org/10.1111/adb.12991; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33331099/,164

In this theory of zoonoses, the introduction event that starts an epidemic is assumed to be independent of all preceding events. However, introductions are often concentrated in communities that bridge the ecological interfaces between reservoirs and the general population. In this paper, we explore how the risks of disease emergence are altered by the aggregation of introduction events within bridge communities. In viscous bridge communities, repeated introductions can elevate the local prevalence of immunity. This local herd immunity can form a barrier reducing the opportunities for disease emergence. In some situations, reducing exposure rates counterintuitively increases the emergence hazards because of off-setting reductions in local immunity. Increases in population mixing can also increase emergence hazards, even when average contact rates are conserved. Our theory of bridge communities may help guide prevention and explain historical emergence events, where disruption of stable economic, political or demographic processes reduced population viscosity at ecological interfaces.","Reluga, Timothy C; Shim, Eunha",Proceedings.

147593,Meet the African researcher who is building a core of junior immunologists on the continent.,2019-07-30,"Progranulin (PGRN) is an autocrine growth factor that exerts crucial roles within cartilage tissue; however the molecular mechanisms underlying PGRN-mediated cartilage homeostasis remain elusive. In the present study, we investigated the role of PGRN in regulating chondrocyte homeostasis and its therapeutic potential for managing osteoarthritis (OA). We found that PGRN levels are significantly increased in human cartilage in mild OA and that its expression is decreased in the cartilage in severe OA. In vitro, treatment of primary rat chondrocytes with recombinant PGRN significantly enhanced the levels of collagen type II alpha 1 chain (COL2A1) and aggrecan, and attenuated TNF-α-induced up-regulation of matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13) and ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 5 (ADAMTS5) in chondrocytes. These effects were abrogated in SIRT1-/- cells, indicating a causative role of SIRT1 in the effects of PGRN on protein expression in chondrocytes. Mechanistically, PGRN increased SIRT1 expression and activity, which reduced the acetylation levels of SRY-box transcription factor (SOX9) and transcription factor P65 (P65) and thereby promoted nuclear translocation of SOX9 and inhibited TNF-α-induced P65 nuclear accumulation to maintain chondrocyte homeostasis. In conclusion, our findings reveal a mechanism of action for PGRN that maintains cartilage homeostasis and support the notion that PGRN up-regulation may be a promising strategy for managing OA.","Feng, Dongxu; Kang, Xiaomin; Wang, Ruiqi; Chen, He; Zhang, Kun; Feng, Weilou; Li, Huixia; Zhu, Yangjun; Wu, Shufang",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra119.011164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747445/,164

The rationale for focusing on organizational change to prevent burnout has pointed to persistent symptoms of burnout even when individual healthy lifestyle interventions are adopted. However, a case can be made that the lifestyle interventions were not implemented at the level of intensity recommended by the lifestyle medicine evidence-base to secure the desired improvement in physical and mental health when facing significant personal and environmental stressors.

DESIGN Experimental model. SETTING Ninety intravenous fluid bags of lactated balanced-electrolytes solution (1 L) hung in a university hospital. INTERVENTIONS Bags were hung in 2 different locations in the ER (sink and bins) and one location in the ICU (sink) for 11 days. Bags were punctured 3 times daily with a sterile needle to simulate clinical use. Injection ports were swabbed and 50 mL of fluid were collected in duplicates on days 0, 2, 4, 7, and 10. Aerobic bacterial cultures were performed on the fluid and injection port. Contamination was defined as bacterial growth of a similar phenotype across 2 consecutive times. Increase in the fluid contamination rate from day 0 was tested using an exact binomial test. Port contamination rate between locations was tested using Fisher's exact test. MAIN RESULTS Combined bacterial growth on injection ports reached a mean (95% confidence interval) of 8.1 (0.005-16.2) cfu/port on day 10. The combined port contamination was 3.3%, 11.1%, 17.8%, and 31.1% on days 0, 2, 4, and 7, respectively. Port contamination was similar between ER and ICU. However, port contamination was higher in the sink versus the bins area (38.3% vs 16.7%, P = 0.032). No fluid bag was contaminated at days 0 and 2. The contamination rate of fluid bag was 1.1% and 4.4% on days 4 and 7, respectively. All bags with contaminated fluid were in the ER (6.7%, 95% exact binomial confidence interval 1.9-16.2%). CONCLUSIONS Injection port contamination reached 31.1% on day 7. Contamination was more likely when the bags were hung next to a sink.

An influenza pandemic is expected to result in a dramatic surge of critically ill patients, and ICU healthcare workers (HCW) are likely to be at high risk of infection. OBJECTIVE To characterize the knowledge, attitudes, and expected behaviors of ICU HCWs concerning the risk of and response to an influenza pandemic. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND SETTING A survey was distributed to 292 HCWs (ie, internal medicine house staff, pulmonary and critical care fellows and faculty members, nurses, and respiratory care professionals) at 2 hospitals in Baltimore, Maryland. RESULTS Of the 292 HCWs, 256 (88%) completed the survey. Just over one-half of the respondents believed there is at least a 45% chance of an influenza pandemic within the next 5 years. However, only 41% reported knowing how to protect themselves during an outbreak. Despite this common belief that a pandemic is likely in the near future, 59% of those surveyed reported only minimal knowledge of the risks of and protective strategies for an influenza pandemic, and 20% reported being unlikely to report to work during a pandemic or being unsure about whether they would do so. The odds of reporting to work varied on the basis of race and responsibility for child care. CONCLUSIONS ICU HCWs reported having minimal knowledge concerning the risk of and response to an influenza pandemic, even though more that one-half of HCWs expect that a pandemic will occur in the near future. This finding in a high-risk setting is of concern, given that lack of knowledge among HCWs may result in increased nosocomial transmission to HCWs and patients.

In order to reduce the spread of Sars-CoV-2 virus, governments of several countries have adopted social isolation as a strategy. However, social isolation has culminated in deleterious effects for the population's health, including increased physical inactivity, stress and, consequently, adverse changes in body composition, cardiorespiratory capacity, muscle strength, physical functionality, and vascular events, which are increasingly pointed out as the main determinants of cardiovascular health. Staying physically active during lockdown is a challenge, especially for the population with a higher risk of mortality from COVID-19 who are still encouraged to maintain social distance until there is a vaccine available. Strategies to avoid physical inactivity, and reduce stress levels can promote cardiovascular protection, and must be considered during COVID-19 time. OBJECTIVES The aim of this paper is to discuss the risks of physical inactivity and stress for the cardiovascular system during the COVID-19 pandemic and propose strategies to protect cardiovascular health.

This study aimed to examine the effect of resection distance from pylorus on % excess weight loss (EWL) during postoperative period, in patients who underwent LSG for morbid obesity. METHODS A total of 390 patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity were included in this retrospective study. Patients were allocated into one of the two groups based on the distance between antrum resection margin and pylorus: group A, ≤ 3 cm and group B, > 3 cm. Follow-up data for %EWS and nausea/vomiting as well as demographical and perioperative data were retrospectively reviewed and logistic regression analysis was done. RESULTS Follow-up data up to 12 months were available for all patients, whereas 199 patients had follow-up data at 24 months. Shorter distance from pylorus was associated with higher %EWL throughout the treatment period (p < 0.001), evident from the first postoperative month (p = 0.013 for the first month, p < 0.001 for all other time points). The benefit extended up to 24 months in ≤ 3 cm group. However, nausea/vomiting was more frequent in the ≤ 3 cm group only at 1-month visit (15% vs. 4%, p < 0.001). In multivariate evaluations, while %EWL variable was taken as a dependent variable, time variable with DP × time interaction was statistically significant in the model. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that a short distance between resection margin and pylorus is associated with better and sustained %EWL in LSG. However, these patients seem to be more prone to nausea and vomiting in the early postoperative period. Further prospective large studies would help to define an optimal resection distance.","Avlanmis, Omer; Isil, Riza Gurhan; Burcu, Busra",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-019-03923-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115850/,164

The authors aimed to select the most optimal single access port for transanal employment. Four single access ports (GelPOINT, TriPort, SSL Access System, and SILS) were tested in 2 pigs. Insertion feasibility and intraoperative features of each port were assessed. A rectal excision was attempted using the most suitable port. Insertion of GelPOINT was impossible. SILS and TriPort were easily inserted; however, insufficient stability demanded manual fixation. CO2 leaked through the TriPort trocar ports. Insertion of the 2-cm SSL Access System retractor was difficult, but pneumorectum and surgical circumstances were favorable. Single port transanal surgery may be a promising alternative for transanal endoscopic microsurgery. The SSL Access System was found the most suitable for this indication in a porcine model.","Barendse, Renée M; Verlaan, Tessa; Bemelman, Willem A; Fockens, Paul; Dekker, Evelien; Nonner, Joost; de Graaf, Eelco J R",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350611425507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22064488/,164

Oral administration of IRW to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) can significantly reduce blood pressure, via upregulation of ACE2, but not through the inhibition of ACE. ACE2 converts Ang II into Ang (1-7), thus lowering blood pressure via Mas receptor (MasR); coinfusion of Mas receptor antagonist A779 and IRW in SHRs abolished blood pressure-lowering effect of IRW, supporting a key role of ACE2/Ang (1-7)/MasR axis. Our ongoing study further established new roles of IRW as an antioxidant, an anti-inflammatory agent, an insulin sensitizer, and a bone cell anabolic. Future studies are warranted to understand the unique structure features of this peptide, its mechanisms of action at various targets, its bioavailability and metabolism, and its possible roles toward COVID-19.","Wu, Jianping",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c05544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33251800/,164

This paper proposes a Best Practice Framework to mitigate these silos. METHODS Mixed-methods research comprising key informant interviews with major stakeholders across both sectors; a survey of people with/without intellectual disability aged 60+ years; qualitative in-depth interviews; and survey of health professionals. RESULTS There is an urgent need to develop inter-sectoral 'integrated care systems'. Key components include choice in accommodation; regular assessment of health and well-being indicators; development and adoption of nationally consistent policies/standards across integrated aged- and disability-care sectors; improved strategies for workforce planning; and upskilling of existing staff including place-based collaboration. CONCLUSIONS An integrated service model requires collaboration on broader public policy instruments, appropriate planning and resourcing.

153263,Coronavirus fears cancel world's biggest physics meeting.,2020-03-02,"OBJECTIVE In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many psychiatrists have rapidly transitioned to telemedicine. This qualitative study sought to understand how this dramatic change in delivery has affected mental health care, including modes of telemedicine psychiatrists used, barriers encountered, and future plans. The aim was to inform the ongoing COVID-19 response and pass on lessons learned to psychiatrists who are starting to offer telemedicine. METHODS From March 31 to April 9, 2020, semistructured interviews were conducted with 20 outpatient psychiatrists practicing in five U.S. states with significant early COVID-19 activity. Inductive and deductive approaches were used to develop interview summaries, and a matrix analysis was conducted to identify and refine themes. RESULTS At the time of the interviews, all 20 psychiatrists had been using telemedicine for 2-4 weeks. Telemedicine encompassed video visits, phone visits, or both. Although many continued to prefer in-person care and planned to return to it after the pandemic, psychiatrists largely perceived the transition positively. However, several noted challenges affecting the quality of provider-patient interactions, such as decreased clinical data for assessment, diminished patient privacy, and increased distractions in the patient's home setting. Several psychiatrists noted that their disadvantaged patients lacked reliable access to a smartphone, computer, or the Internet. Participants identified several strategies that helped them improve telemedicine visit quality. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has driven a dramatic shift in how psychiatrists deliver care. Findings highlight that although psychiatrists expressed some concerns about the quality of these encounters, the transition has been largely positive for both patients and physicians.","Uscher-Pines, Lori; Sousa, Jessica; Raja, Pushpa; Mehrotra, Ateev; Barnett, Michael L; Huskamp, Haiden A",Psychiatric services,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32933411/,164

Seroconversion is measured frequently around the world, but the milk conversion rate is unknown. RESEARCH AIMS To determine (1) the prevalence and (2) the dynamics of immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human milk amongst lactating mothers in the Netherlands. METHODS In this large prospective cohort study, lactating mothers (N = 2312) were included between October 12, 2020 and February 24, 2021. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine levels of IgA antibodies in human milk and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in serum against the ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. RESULTS A total of 691 (30.6%) participants had SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in human milk and/or serum. Of these participants, 524 (23.1%) had IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human milk, and 356 (15.7%) had IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum. A total of 199 (8.8%) participants had antibodies in both human milk and serum. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA antibodies in human milk remain present at least 10 months after a polymerase chain reaction confirmed infection. CONCLUSION The prevalence of IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human milk was 23.1% in our cohort. This high prevalence of antibodies in human milk might lead to passive immunity in many breastfed infants and may serve as protection against COVID-19.","Juncker, Hannah G; Romijn, Michelle; Loth, Veerle N; Ruhé, Eliza J M; Bakker, Sjors; Kleinendorst, Saskia; de Groot, Christianne J M; Pajkrt, Dasja; Korosi, Aniko; van Goudoever, Johannes B; van Gils, Marit J; van Keulen, Britt J",Journal of human lactation : official journal of International Lactation Consultant Association,https://doi.org/10.1177/08903344211018185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33982613/,164
155226,Four Phases in the Metamorphosis of The Consultant Urologist.,2021-07-22,"OBJECTIVES Host gene expression signatures discriminate bacterial and viral infection but have not been translated to a clinical test platform. This study enrolled an independent cohort of patients to describe and validate a first-in-class host response bacterial/viral test. DESIGN Subjects were recruited from 2006 to 2016. Enrollment blood samples were collected in an RNA preservative and banked for later testing. The reference standard was an expert panel clinical adjudication, which was blinded to gene expression and procalcitonin results. SETTING Four U.S. emergency departments. PATIENTS Six-hundred twenty-three subjects with acute respiratory illness or suspected sepsis. INTERVENTIONS Forty-five-transcript signature measured on the BioFire FilmArray System (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT) in ~45 minutes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Host response bacterial/viral test performance characteristics were evaluated in 623 participants (mean age 46 yr; 45% male) with bacterial infection, viral infection, coinfection, or noninfectious illness. Performance of the host response bacterial/viral test was compared with procalcitonin. The test provided independent probabilities of bacterial and viral infection in ~45 minutes. In the 213-subject training cohort, the host response bacterial/viral test had an area under the curve for bacterial infection of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84-0.94) and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.87-0.95) for viral infection. Independent validation in 209 subjects revealed similar performance with an area under the curve of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.78-0.90) for bacterial infection and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.94) for viral infection. The test had 80.1% (95% CI, 73.7-85.4%) average weighted accuracy for bacterial infection and 86.8% (95% CI, 81.8-90.8%) for viral infection in this validation cohort. This was significantly better than 68.7% (95% CI, 62.4-75.4%) observed for procalcitonin (p < 0.001). An additional cohort of 201 subjects with indeterminate phenotypes (coinfection or microbiology-negative infections) revealed similar performance. CONCLUSIONS The host response bacterial/viral measured using the BioFire System rapidly and accurately discriminated bacterial and viral infection better than procalcitonin, which can help support more appropriate antibiotic use.","Tsalik, Ephraim L; Henao, Ricardo; Montgomery, Jesse L; Nawrocki, Jeff W; Aydin, Mert; Lydon, Emily C; Ko, Emily R; Petzold, Elizabeth; Nicholson, Bradly P; Cairns, Charles B; Glickman, Seth W; Quackenbush, Eugenia; Kingsmore, Stephen F; Jaehne, Anja K; Rivers, Emanuel P; Langley, Raymond J; Fowler, Vance G; McClain, Micah T; Crisp, Robert J; Ginsburg, Geoffrey S; Burke, Thomas W; Hemmert, Andrew C; Woods, Christopher W",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000005085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33938716/,164

Clinical and x-ray examination and orthodontic treatment were carried out in 120 patients with anomalies of the dentition complex. Patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 - 30 patients aged 5 to 11 years. Group 2 - 50 patients aged 12 to 17 years. Group 3 - 40 patients aged 18 to 40 years. All patients underwent CT examination of the skull before treatment, and during the retention period of treatment. After a diagnostic examination of the proposed method for diagnosing the anatomical and functional state of the dentition complex and drawing up a treatment plan, all patients underwent orthodontic treatment, which consisted in the expansion of the upper jaw using various orthodontic appliances for expansion. This method allows to identify anomalies in the position of the tongue before and after orthodontic treatment, to assess the quality of orthodontic treatment, based on the analysis of not only the tongue filling the space of the dome of the palate, but also the position of the bone structures of the skull in three planes. The high quality of the study allows us to give a reliable assessment of the state of maxillofacial structures: the position of the upper and lower jaws, inclination of teeth, the stage of formation of the patient's growth, airway lumen and the influence of tongue on these structures at different stages of development of the maxillofacial skull. When comparing the results of the study, not all patients carried out recovered the anatomical and functional balance of the maxillofacial complex after orthodontic treatment, suggesting the need for more myogymnastics of the tongue before, during, and after treatment.","Popova, N V; Arsenina, O I; Makhortova, P I; Gayrbekova, L A; Popova, A V",Stomatologiia,https://doi.org/10.17116/stomat20209903160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32608952/,164
155658,Healthy outlook.,2009,"Methods We adopted RNA-sequencing approach to identify differential lncRNAs and genes in leukocytes, clustered expression profiles, and analyzed biological functions and pathways of differential genes to decode their potential roles in contributing to characteristics and functions of leukocytes. In addition, interaction networks were created to detail the interactions between differential genes. In particular, we explored differential lncRNAs-mediated regulation of differential genes and predicted the subcellular location of lncRNAs to reveal their potential roles. Results Compared with TCM-defined balanced constitution (BC), 183 and 93 genes as well as 749 and 651 lncRNAs were differentially expressed (P < 0.05 and |log2 (fold change)| ≥1) in leukocytes of individuals from case populations 1 (QDC) and 2 (PQDS), respectively. Of them, 12 genes and 111 lncRNAs were common to each case population. Several networks were created to detail the interactions among case-specific genes, especially case-specific lncRNAs-mediated regulation of case-specific genes. Also, interaction networks were created for the common lncRNAs and genes. HCL analyses showed that differential genes and lncRNAs, especially the common genes and lncRNAs, kept similar expression patterns in both case populations. Furthermore, function enrichment analyses just indicated the common biological processes, namely, extracellular matrix organization and cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules. In addition, most common genes underwent very tight and complex regulation of many trans- and cis-acting lncRNAs. In particular, of them, ADAMTSL5, COL26A1, COL27A1, MSH5, and LOC390937 could be regulated by multiple case-specific and common lncRNAs, including the means that directs binding of the common lncRNAs to their coded proteins. The common changes in the extracellular matrix and integral components of plasma membrane related to cell-cell adhesion/junction and communication may implicate the linkage between QDC and PQDS, contributing to alterations in characteristics and functions of leukocytes. Conclusions These results may provide new insights into the characteristic and functional changes of leukocytes in QDC and PQDS, especially the mechanism underlying the linkage of QDC to PQDS, with potential leukocytes biomarkers for future application in integrative medicine.","You, Leiming; Liu, Aijie; Sang, Xiaopu; Gao, Xinhui; Li, Ting'An; Zhang, Shen; Li, Kunyu; Wang, Wei; Huang, Guangrui; Wang, Ting; Xu, Anlong",Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8518053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724329/,164

Portal vein (PV) and intrarenal venous flow alterations are markers of abdominal venous congestion and have been associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) in cardiac surgery patients. It is currently unknown if portal vein flow (PVF) alterations in heart failure can be reversed with diuretic treatment and track decongestion. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to evaluate PVF alterations in patients with ADHF at arrival and after decongestive treatment. METHODS Assessment of venous congestion using point-of-care ultrasound was performed in 12 patients with ADHF (6 patients with left-sided heart failure and 6 patients with right-sided heart failure). Evaluation included inferior vena cava (IVC) size and collapsibility in addition to PV Doppler to determine pulsatility fraction (PF). RESULTS Increased PV PF (81.75 ± 13%) was found on admission. After effective decongestive treatment, it improved to (17.43 ± 2.2%). Improvement in IVC size and collapsibility was seen in most patients with left-sided heart failure and none of the patients with right-sided heart failure. Improvement in PV PF coincided with return to baseline of Serum Cr in patients that presented with AKI.

Here, we studied the immunogenicity of human SARS-CoV 3a and bat SL-CoV 3a DNA vaccines in mice through electroporation immunization followed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent, enzyme-linked immunospot, and flow cytometry assays. Our results showed that high levels of specific humoral responses were induced by SARS-CoV 3a and SL-CoV 3a DNA vaccines. Furthermore, a strong Th1-based cellular immune response was stimulated by both DNA vaccines. The vaccines stimulated gamma interferon production mainly by CD8(+) T cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2) mainly by CD4(+) T cells. Of interest, the frequency of IL-2-positive cells elicited by the SARS-CoV 3a DNA vaccine was significantly higher than that elicited by the SL-CoV 3a DNA vaccine.

Additionally, the public has heightened concerns regarding radiation exposure from medical procedures. This study analyzes radiation dose and fluoroscopy time during treatment of large and giant proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms with the pipeline embolization device (PED) versus traditional coiling techniques. METHODS Radiation dose, fluoroscopy time, and contrast dye administration were retrospectively analyzed in 55 patients undergoing endovascular treatment of aneurysms ≥ 10 mm from petrous to superior hypophyseal ICA segments. Patients were treated by either PED (37 patients) or traditional coiling techniques (18 patients). Aortic arch type and proximal ICA tortuosity were also assessed as markers of access difficulty. RESULTS Average radiation dose with PED treatment was 2840 ± 213 mGy and 4010 ± 708 mGy with traditional coiling techniques (p=0.048; 29% decrease with PED). Mean fluoroscopy time for PED was 56.1 ± 5.0 min and 85.9 ± 11.9 min for coiling cases (p=0.0087; 35% decrease with PED). These benefits existed despite more difficult arch anatomy and a trend towards greater proximal vessel tortuosity in PED cases. Contrast dye amounts were also reduced by 37.5% in PED cases (75 ± 6 mL) versus coiling cases (120 ± 13 mL, p=0.0008). CONCLUSIONS Treatment of large and giant proximal ICA aneurysms using PED requires less radiation, less fluoroscopy time, and less contrast administration than standard coiling techniques. This further demonstrates the benefits of flow diversion for treatment of these aneurysms.","Colby, Geoffrey P; Lin, Li-Mei; Nundkumar, Neelesh; Jiang, Bowen; Huang, Judy; Tamargo, Rafael J; Coon, Alexander L",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011193; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714609/,164
158019,Evaluation of a newly developed piezo actuator-driven pulsed water jet system for liver resection in a surviving swine animal model.,2016,"BACKGROUND Previously, we reported that the Ventral Hernia Risk Score (VHRS) was more accurate in a Veterans Affairs (VA) population in predicting surgical site infection (SSI) after open ventral hernia repair (VHR) compared with other models such as the Ventral Hernia Working Group (VHWG) model. The VHRS was developed using single-center data and stratifies SSI risk into five groups based on concomitant hernia repair, skin flaps created, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score ≥3, body mass index ≥40 kg/m(2), and incision class 4. The purpose of this study was to validate the VHRS for other hospitals. METHODS A prospective database of all open VHRs performed at three institutions from 2009-2011 was utilized. All 436 patients with a follow-up of at least 1 mo were included. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition of SSI was utilized. Each patient was assigned a VHRS, VHWG, and CDC incision classification. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were used to assess predictive accuracy, and the areas under the curve (AUCs) were compared for the three risk-stratification systems. RESULTS The median follow-up was 20 mos (range 1-49 mos). During this time, 111 patients (25.5%) developed a SSI. The AUC of the VHRS (0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-0.78) was greater than that of the VHWG (0.66; 95% CI 0.60-0.72; p<0.01) and the CDC incision class (0.68; 95% CI 0.61-0.74; p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The VHRS provides a novel, internally and externally validated score for a patient's likelihood of developing a SSI after open VHR. Elevating skin flaps, ASA score ≥3, concomitant procedures, morbid obesity, and incision class all independently predicted SSI. It remains to be determined if pre-operative patient selection and risk reduction, surgical techniques, and post-operative management can improve outcomes in the highest-risk patients. The VHRS provides a starting point for key stakeholders to discuss the management of ventral hernias.","Liang, Mike K; Goodenough, Christopher J; Martindale, Robert G; Roth, J Scott; Kao, Lillian S",Surgical infections,https://doi.org/10.1089/sur.2014.115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25761078/,164

However, low efficacy of prevailing vaccines to newly emerging influenza strains and an increasing resistance to available drugs, drives intense research to explore more effective inhibitors. Hemagglutinin (HA), one of the major surface proteins of influenza strains, represents an attractive therapeutic target to develop such new inhibitors. Areas covered: This review summarizes current progress of HA-based influenza virus inhibitors and their mechanisms of action, which may facilitate further research in developing novel antiviral inhibitors for controlling influenza infections. Expert opinion: HA-mediated entry of influenza virus is an essential step for successful infection of the host, which makes HA as a promising target for the development of antiviral drugs. Recent progress in delineating the crystal structures of HA, especially HA-inhibitors complexes, has revealed a number of key residues and conserved binding pockets within HA.

We employed a genome-wide insertional mutagenesis approach in human haploid cells to identify host factors crucial for vaccinia virus infection. A library of mutagenized HAP1 cells was exposed to modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA). Deep-sequencing analysis of virus-resistant cells identified host factors involved in heparan sulfate synthesis, Golgi organization, and vesicular protein trafficking. We validated EXT1, TM9SF2, and TMED10 (TMP21/p23/p24δ) as important host factors for vaccinia virus infection. The critical roles of EXT1 in heparan sulfate synthesis and vaccinia virus infection were confirmed. TM9SF2 was validated as a player mediating heparan sulfate expression, explaining its contribution to vaccinia virus infection. In addition, TMED10 was found to be crucial for virus-induced plasma membrane blebbing and phosphatidylserine-induced macropinocytosis, presumably by regulating the cell surface expression of the TAM receptor Axl.IMPORTANCE Poxviruses are large DNA viruses that can infect a wide range of host species. A number of these viruses are clinically important to humans, including variola virus (smallpox) and vaccinia virus. Since the eradication of smallpox, zoonotic infections with monkeypox virus and cowpox virus are emerging. Additionally, poxviruses can be engineered to specifically target cancer cells and are used as a vaccine vector against tuberculosis, influenza, and coronaviruses. Poxviruses rely on host factors for most stages of their life cycle, including attachment to the cell and entry. These host factors are crucial for virus infectivity and host cell tropism. We used a genome-wide knockout library of host cells to identify host factors necessary for vaccinia virus infection. We confirm a dominant role for heparin sulfate in mediating virus attachment. Additionally, we show that TMED10, previously not implicated in virus infections, facilitates virus uptake by modulating the cellular response to phosphatidylserine.","Luteijn, Rutger D; van Diemen, Ferdy; Blomen, Vincent A; Boer, Ingrid G J; Manikam Sadasivam, Saravanan; van Kuppevelt, Toin H; Drexler, Ingo; Brummelkamp, Thijn R; Lebbink, Robert Jan; Wiertz, Emmanuel J",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02160-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30996093/,164

Patients in the positive trials were treated at hospitals with complex, efficient, resource-rich, team-based stroke systems in place. To ensure attainment of trial results in actual practice, patients should receive treatment at facilities certified as having the resources, personnel, organization, and continuous quality improvement processes characteristic of trial centers. It is our hope that, through greater education initiatives, robust resource investment, and developing quality-based certification processes, the results demonstrated by these trials may be extrapolated to greater numbers of centers - in turn allowing greater access for patients to high-quality, advanced stroke care.","Mocco, J; Fargen, Kyle M; Goyal, Mayank; Levy, Elad I; Mitchell, Peter J; Campbell, Bruce C V; Majoie, Charles B L M; Dippel, Diederik W J; Khatri, Pooja; Hill, Michael D; Saver, Jeffery L",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijs.12614; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26404879/,164

Such patients cannot tolerate long-time sports rehabilitation owing to dyspnea and fail to achieve the desired therapeutic effect; therefore, increasing nutritional support will be an important strategy for them. The present study applied metabolomics technology to evaluate the correlation between serum concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites, nutritional status, and lung function in patients with COPD to provide a theoretical basis for accurate nutritional support. Materials and Methods We enrolled 82 patients with stable severe COPD in our hospital. The general characteristics including height, weight, and lung function were recorded. Metabolomics was used to detect the concentrations of serum metabolites of n-3 and n-6 at baseline and at 24 and 52 weeks after enrollment. The correlations between nutrition level and pulmonary function and clinical indicators were evaluated. Results The concentrations of n-3 and n-6 increased over time along with the progression of COPD. Body mass index (BMI) and percent of ideal body weight (IBW%) decreased with disease development, and BMI was found to be significantly correlated with FEV1% predicted and FEV1/FVC. Serum levels of n-6 metabolites such as linoleic acid (LA), γ-linoleic acid (GLA), and arachidonic acid (ARA) (all P < 0.01) and the n-3 metabolites such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (all P < 0.05) showed significant correlations with BMI and were closely correlated with FEV1% predicted and FEV1/FVC of lung function (all P< 0.05). Conclusion This study demonstrates that malnutrition in patients with severe COPD is progressive and is positively correlated with n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and lung function.","Xue, Mingshan; Cai, Chuanxu; Guan, Lili; Xu, Yifan; Lin, Jinsheng; Zeng, Yifeng; Hu, Haisheng; Chen, Rongchang; Wang, Hongman; Zhou, Luqian; Sun, Baoqing",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,https://doi.org/10.2147/copd.s245617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764909/,164

Data in children regarding catheter-based rheolytic and aspiration thrombectomy systems are limited. We sought to review the safety and efficacy of catheter-based rheolytic and aspiration thrombectomy systems in children. METHODS Data of all children having undergone thrombectomy using specialized rheolytic or aspiration systems were reviewed. RESULTS Thrombectomy was performed in 50 vessels in 21 patients, median age 1.9 months (8 days-18 yrs), median weight 4.3 (1.1-67.9) kg. Thrombectomy was performed using AngioJet in 16, Helix Clot Buster in 5, Fetch catheter in 8, Pronto catheter in 1, and a combination of other systems in 20 vessels (with AngioJet in 16). Thrombectomy was successful in 47/50 (94%) vessels in 18/21 (86%) patients with additional balloon/stent therapy or tPA administration performed in 16/18 (89%) of these patients. There were 2 (9.5%) major complications (both with AngioJet) consisting of asystole when thrombectomy was performed using activation times of >5 sec. At a median follow-up of 10 months (2 weeks-7 years), all 47 successfully treated vessels are patent, with 8/18 (44%) patients requiring reintervention with angioplasty/stent placement or repeat thrombectomy.

160814,Patients' Perceptions on Surgical Care Suspension for Pelvic Floor Disorders During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-06-25,"BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is rapidly gaining popularity as the practical alternative to natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). Although SILS achieves essentially the same goal as NOTES (a nearly invisible scar in the umbilicus), it does not carry the significant potential risks of a transluminal approach. The SILS approach has been most commonly described for cholecystectomy and appendectomy. The authors describe a novel application for this approach in the placement of a feeding jejunostomy tube. The described application for this technique is the first to be reported. METHODS The authors describe use of the technique for two intensive care unit (ICU) patients requiring long-term postpyloric tube feeds. Access was obtained through the umbilicus with the SILS port. The selected loop of the jejunum was exteriorized through this incision, and the feeding tube was placed. The loop was returned into the abdomen, and the SILS port was replaced in the incision. Under laparoscopic visualization and guidance, the feeding tube was brought externally through a predetermined site in the left midabdomen. RESULTS Two patients underwent SILS jejunostomy tube placement. The average operating time was 42.5 min. No intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications occurred. Tube feedings were started on postoperative day 1 for both patients, with good bowel function. CONCLUSION The SILS technique for jejunostomy placement is a promising and feasible alternative to the current methods. It is less invasive than the open approach while providing complete intraabdominal visualization. It is less technically demanding than the direct percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (PEJ) approach and avoids the risks and difficulties associated with it. The same benefits of other SILS procedures are evident in this application. The authors believe a series study will further highlight long-term benefits and any potential complications.","Mohiuddin, S Sameer; Anderson, C Erik",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1168-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20607567/,164

PAPRs offer health care workers added protection when dealing with patients who have high-risk infectious disease such as COVID-19. Unfortunately, PAPRs can produce notable levels of background noise. We hypothesize that PAPR use may be associated with increased hearing thresholds and impaired word discrimination and may ultimately have a negative impact on effective communication. Herein, we (1) determined sound levels generated by PAPRs and (2) measured hearing thresholds and word discrimination with and without operational PAPRs. All participants had normal hearing. When the PAPR was operational, mean ± SD thresholds increased from 4.5 ± 3.6 to 38.6 ± 5.6 dB HL (P < .001). Word discrimination dropped from 100% in all participants in quiet to a mean 48% ± 14% with operational PAPR (P < .001). Thus, we find that use of PAPR hoods results in hearing impairment comparable to moderate to severe hearing loss, and we suspect that users will experience communication difficulties as a result.Level of Evidence.

161946,Coronapod: One whistle-blower's quest to take politics out of coronavirus surveillance.,2021-04-09,"BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia, is a major risk factor for stroke. Rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, is approved for the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular AF. In the pivotal phase III trial ROCKET AF, rivaroxaban demonstrated non-inferiority compared with warfarin for reducing the risk of stroke or systemic embolism (SE) in patients with AF (intention-to-treat analysis), without an increased risk of major bleeding. Superior efficacy vs. warfarin was achieved while patients were on study medication. Other direct oral factor Xa inhibitors have completed phase III clinical trials in this indication. Compared with warfarin, apixaban (in the ARISTOTLE trial) and edoxaban (in the ENGAGE-AF trial) were shown to be superior or non-inferior, respectively, for reduction in stroke or SE risk in patients with AF. Baseline stroke risk, as indicated by CHADS2 scores, was lower in patients in the ARISTOTLE and ENGAGE-AF trials than in ROCKET AF. OBJECTIVES This review discusses the main findings from ROCKET AF, specifically examining recent subgroup analyses investigating rivaroxaban use across various patient types at high risk for adverse outcomes, including those with prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack, reduced renal function, prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, heart failure or patients aged ≥ 75 years and those resident in East Asia. CONCLUSIONS These subgroup analyses demonstrate that the treatment effect for rivaroxaban vs. warfarin is broadly consistent across a wide range of patient groups, with respect to both efficacy and safety.","Diener, H-C; Halperin, J L; Fox, K; Hankey, G J",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.12631; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25854636/,164
162856,End-to-end computational approach to the design of RNA biosensors for miRNA biomarkers of cervical cancer,2021-07-09,"We consider the design of distributed algorithms that govern the manner in which agents contribute to a social sensing platform. Specifically, we are interested in situations where fairness among the agents contributing to the platform is needed. A notable example are platforms operated by public bodies, where fairness is a legal requirement. The design of such distributed systems is challenging due to the fact that we wish to simultaneously realise an efficient social sensing platform, but also deliver a predefined quality of service to the agents (for example, a fair opportunity to contribute to the platform). In this paper, we introduce iterated function systems (IFS) as a tool for the design and analysis of systems of this kind. We show how the IFS framework can be used to realise systems that deliver a predictable quality of service to agents, can be used to underpin contracts governing the interaction of agents with the social sensing platform, and which are efficient. To illustrate our design via a use case, we consider a large, high-density network of participating parked vehicles. When awoken by an administrative centre, this network proceeds to search for moving missing entities of interest using RFID-based techniques. We regulate which vehicles are actively searching for the moving entity of interest at any point in time. In doing so, we seek to equalise vehicular energy consumption across the network. This is illustrated through simulations of a search for a missing Alzheimer's patient in Melbourne, Australia. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the efficacy of our system and the predictability of access of agents to the platform independent of initial conditions.","Ghosh, Ramen; Marecek, Jakub; Griggs, Wynita M.; Souza, Matheus; Shorten, Robert N.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.16117v3.pdf,164

164922,Parallel Implementation of Smith-Waterman Algorithm on FPGA,2021-07-27,"In order to fight the spread of the global COVID-19 pandemic, most of the world's countries have taken control measures such as lockdowns during a few weeks to a few months. These lockdowns had significant impacts on economic and personal activities in many countries. Several studies using satellite and surface observations have reported important changes in the spatial and temporal distributions of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gases. Global and regional chemistry-transport model studies are being performed in order to analyze the impact of these lockdowns on the distribution of atmospheric compounds. These modeling studies aim at evaluating the impact of the regional lockdowns at the global scale. In order to provide input for the global and regional model simulations, a dataset providing adjustment factors (AFs) that can easily be applied to current global and regional emission inventories has been developed. This dataset provides, for the January–August 2020 period, gridded AFs at a0.1×0.1 latitude–longitude degree resolution on a daily or monthly basis for the transportation (road, air and ship traffic), power generation, industry and residential sectors. The quantification of AFs is based on activity data collected from different databases and previously published studies. A range of AFs are provided at each grid point for model sensitivity studies. The emission AFs developed in this study are applied to the CAMS global inventory (CAMS-GLOB-ANT_v4.2_R1.1), and the changes in emissions of the main pollutants are discussed for different regions of the world and the first 6 months of 2020. Maximum decreases in the total emissions are found in February in eastern China, with an average reduction of 20 %–30 % in NOx, NMVOCs (non-methane volatile organic compounds) and SO2 relative to the reference emissions. In the other regions, the maximum changes occur in April, with average reductions of 20 %–30 % for NOx, NMVOCs and CO in Europe and North America and larger decreases (30 %–50 %) in South America. In India and African regions, NOx and NMVOC emissions are reduced on average by 15 %–30 %. For the other species, the maximum reductions are generally less than 15 %, except in South America, where large decreases in CO and BC (black carbon) are estimated. As discussed in the paper, reductions vary highly across regions and sectors due to the differences in the duration of the lockdowns before partial or complete recovery.The dataset providing a range of AFs (average and average ± standard deviation) is called CONFORM (COvid-19 adjustmeNt Factors fOR eMissions) (https://doi.org/10.25326/88;Doumbia et al., 2020).

The impact of long-term distancing measures in terms of alcohol use and misuse is yet unknown. Any increase, would not only add to the usual disease burden associated with alcohol, but also add to the COVID-19 load, given that alcohol use may weaken the immune response.ObjectivesTo characterize and compare the pattern of alcohol consumption throughout the pandemic in patients with the diagnosis of Alcohol Use Disorder;to identify factors considered as most relevant in the increase of alcohol consumption.MethodsWe conducted a observational study in an outpatient population in Centro Hospitalar Psiquiátrico de Lisboa (Portugal) with diagnosis of Alcohol Use Disorder, 6 months after the pandemic lockdown. We characterized our sample regarding social, demographic and clinical categories. We applied auto-filled questionnaires, particularly: Mental Health Inventory (MHI), Positive Mental Health Scale (PMHS) and Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ-C).ResultsA total of 65 patients were included. More than 30% changed their drinking habits because of the pandemic. Nearly half of these increased consumption, and half decreased (16% vs 14%). The increase affected particularly men, and was related with the severity of alcohol dependence, stress-related coping strategies and psycopathology;on the other hand, a lowered level of consumption based on the decrease of alcohol accessability and affordability.ConclusionsThe current situation is unique in terms of mass physical distancing and may trigger different behaviours that should be monitored.

165523,Short-Range Transportation Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) during Disasters in Japan,2020,"Neonates are at increased risk for bacterial sepsis as a result of immature immunity. We established that the immune suppressive cytokine interleukin (IL)-27 is elevated in early life. In the present work, we hypothesized that increased levels of IL-27 may predispose the neonatal population to more severe infection during sepsis. In a neonatal sepsis model, systemic IL-27 levels continued to rise during infection. Peripheral tissue analysis revealed systemic IL-27 expression, while myeloid cell profiling identified Gr-1 and F4/80-expressing cells as the most abundant producers of IL-27 during infection. Increased IL-27 levels were consistent with increased mortality that was improved in WSX-1-/- mice that lack a functional IL-27 receptor. Infected WSX-1-/- pups exhibited improved weight gain and reduced morbidity. IL-27 signaling in WT mice promoted increased bacterial burdens and systemic inflammation compared to WSX-1-/- neonates. This was consistent with more efficient bacterial killing by Ly6B.2+ myeloid cells and macrophages from WSX-1-deficient compared to wild-type neonates. Live animal imaging further supported a more severe and disseminated infection in WT neonates. This is the first report to describe the impact of elevated early life IL-27 on the host response in neonates while also defining the cell and tissue sources of cytokine. IL-27 is frequently associated with suppressed inflammation. In contrast, our findings demonstrate that IL-27 promotes inflammation during neonatal sepsis by directly compromising control of bacteria that drive the inflammatory response. Collectively, our results suggest that IL-27 represents a therapeutic target to limit susceptibility and improve infectious outcomes in neonatal sepsis. IMPORTANCE A number of differences in the neonatal immune response compared with adults have been well described. However, a mechanistic understanding of what needs to be overcome in the neonate to generate a more protective immune response during acute bacterial infection has been limited. The work described here helps fill the gap of what is necessary to overcome in order to achieve improved host response to infection. To further the novelty, IL-27 has not previously been attributed to dysfunction or deficiency in neonatal immunity. Our results enhance the understanding of IL-27 biology in the neonatal population while providing evidence that elevated IL-27 levels limit a protective immune response and are detrimental during neonatal sepsis. Strategies aimed at targeting circulating IL-27 concentrations early in life have the potential to improve control of bacterial infection in neonates.","Seman, Brittany G.; Vance, Jordan K.; Rawson, Travis W.; Witt, Michelle R.; Huckaby, Annalisa B.; Povroznik, Jessica M.; Bradford, Shelby D.; Barbier, Mariette; Robinson, Cory M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/777839,164

A total of 1,494 hsSNC- linked genes are associated with either autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance and 2,273 hsSNC-linked genes have been associated with premature death, embryonic lethality, as well as pre-, peri-, neo-, and post-natal lethality phenotypes of both complete and incomplete penetrance. Differential GSEA implemented on hsSNC-linked loci and associated genes identify 7,990 genes linked to evolutionary distinct classes of human-specific regulatory sequences (HSRS), expression of a majority of which (5,389 genes; 67%) is regulated by stem cell-associated retroviral sequences (SCARS). Interrogations of the MGI database revealed readily available mouse models tailored for precise experimental definitions of functional effects of hsSNCs and SCARS on genes causally affecting thousands of mammalian phenotypes and implicated in hundreds of common and rare human disorders. These observations suggest that a preponderance of human-specific traits evolved under a combinatorial regulatory control of HSRS and neuro-regulatory loci harboring hsSNCs that are fixed in humans, distinct from other primates, and located in differentially-accessible chromatin regions during brain development.","Glinsky, Gennadi V.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/848762,164
167608,Study about the Effect of Addition of Carbon Nanofibers on the Strain-Rate Sensitivity of Thermoplastic Polymer Matrix Nanocomposites Manufactured by Ultrasonic Processing,2020-12-31,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had a social and economic impact worldwide, and vaccination is an efficient strategy for diminishing those damages. New adjuvant formulations are required for the high vaccine demands, especially adjuvant formulations that induce a Th1 phenotype. Herein we assess a vaccination strategy using a combination of Alum and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)) adjuvants plus the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a prefusion trimeric conformation by an intradermal (ID) route. We found high levels of IgG anti-spike antibodies in the serum by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and high neutralizing titers against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro by neutralization assay, after one or two boosts. By evaluating the production of IgG subtypes, as expected, we found that formulations containing Poly(I:C) induced IgG2a whereas Alum did not. The combination of these two adjuvants induced high levels of both IgG1 and IgG2a. In addition, cellular immune responses of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing interferon-gamma were equivalent, demonstrating that the Alum + Poly(I:C) combination supported a Th1 profile. Based on the high neutralizing titers, we evaluated B cells in the germinal centers, which are specific for receptor-binding domain (RBD) and spike, and observed that more positive B cells were induced upon the Alum + Poly(I:C) combination. Moreover, these B cells produced antibodies against both RBD and non-RBD sites. We also studied the impact of this vaccination preparation (spike protein with Alum + Poly(I:C)) in the lungs of mice challenged with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus. We found a production of IgG, but not IgA, and a reduction in neutrophil recruitment in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of mice, suggesting that our immunization scheme reduced lung inflammation. Altogether, our data suggest that Alum and Poly(I:C) together is a possible adjuvant combination for vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 by the intradermal route.","dos-Santos, Júlio Souza; Firmino-Cruz, Luan; Fonseca-Martins, Alessandra Marcia da; Oliveira-Maciel, Diogo; Perez, Gustavo Guadagini; Pereira, Victor A.

Another side of the project relates to one of the possible factors, which is priming via preamble, or a virtual replica of the immediate physical environment, used to stimulate presence. It is planned to manipulate the realisticness of the preamble, where less realistic preamble can lower expectations towards the next virtual environment increasing chances for the sense of presence to appear. The project is on the 'pre-research stage' due to the difficulties that the pandemic has brought in many aspects of our life.

We have estimated health endpoints and possible gains if two policy scenarios were implemented and air pollution reduction achieved. Real-world health and recorded PM pollution data for 2018 were used for assessing the health impacts and possible gains. Calculations were performed with WHO AirQ+ software against two scenarios with cut-off levels at country-legal values and WHO air quality recommendations. Ambient PM2.5 pollution is responsible for 16.20% and 22.77% of all-cause mortality among adults in Tuzla and Lukavac, respectively. Our data show that life expectancy could increase by 2.1 and 2.4 years for those cities. In the pollution hotspots, in reality, there is a wide gap in what is observed and the implementation of the legally binding air quality limit values and, thus, adverse health effects. Considerable health gains and life expectancy are possible if legal or health scenarios in polluted cities were achieved. This estimate might be useful in providing additional health burden evidence as a key component for a clean air policy and action plans.","Matkovic, Vlatka Mulić Maida Azabagić Selma Jevtić Marija",Atmosphere,https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos11101107,164

These papers are most read and influential in the modern media space not only in Spain but in the international market, and in particular in Latin America. The main goal of the study is to show how the image of Russia in the international media space affects the presentation of the pandemic in Russia in Spanish mass media. The author also studies the “quality press” concept and analyses this through the prism of Russian and foreign approaches. The analysis of the publications (152 articles), selected using the keywords “Russia”, “Moscow”, “Putin”, “Covid-19”, showed that some newspapers, being of high-quality and most read, do not reflect the pandemic situation in Russia widely (El País), or represent the sanitary situation in Russia partly and in the context of the domestic politics focused on the figure of the President (El Mundo). Another newspaper ABC corresponds to all the requirements for the status of quality press and covers the current situation of the pandemic in Russia objectively;75 materials published during the analysed period draw the readers’ attention to the situation with the pandemic and not on the political situation in Russia. © Vestnik Novosibirskogo Gosudarstvennogo Universiteta, Seriya: Istoriya, Filologiya 2021.","Simonova, M.

Additionally, the passenger occupancy rate of different modes of transportation during the similar time periods were compared and analyzed to identify the changes in monthly usage rate for each mode. In the case of private vehicles and public bicycles, the usage rates have recovered or increased when compared to those of before the pandemic. Conversely, bus and rail passenger service rates have decreased from the previous year before the pandemic. Furthermore, it is found that existing bus and rail users have switched to the private auto mode due to COVID-19.

177387,Mobility and Citizenship during Pandemics: The multilevel political responses in South America,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted US healthcare delivery and led to delays in life-prolonging therapy for some conditions. Its impact on diagnosis and timely care delivery for patients (pts) with cancer is unknown. We assessed the pandemic's impact on time from advanced diagnosis to systemic treatment initiation (TTI) for pts with newly diagnosed advanced solid cancers. Methods: We performed a controlled interrupted time series analysis using the nationwide Flatiron Health electronic health record-derived deidentified database, which originated from 280 US cancer clinics. The study sample included pts ≥ 18 years diagnosed with advanced solid cancers from Jan 1-Jul 31 in 2019 or in 2020, excluding a 30-day period (Mar 8-Apr 7) encompassing the start of most state stay-athome orders. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate standardized predicted probabilities of TTI within 30 days of advanced diagnosis before (Jan-Mar) and during (Apr-Jul) the pandemic in 2020, compared to historical controls in 2019, adjusted for age, sex, race, insurance, performance status, and cancer type. Interactions by cancer type and race examined heterogeneity of effects. Results: The study included 12,977 pts (median age 69 yrs [IQR 61- 77];47.4% female;59.4% non-Hispanic white). At the time of analysis, fewer advanced cancer diagnoses were recorded in 2020 (Jan-Mar 2,409;Apr-Jul 3,027) than in 2019 (Jan-Mar 2,910;Apr-Jul 4,631). Compared to Apr-Jul 2019, pts diagnosed with advanced cancer during the COVID-19 period were more likely to have De novo (vs recurrent) disease (67.3% vs 56.8%). In adjusted models, the COVID-19 period was associated with an increased probability of treatment within 30 days (adjusted differencein-differences +5.2 percentage points [ppts]). TTI improvements were not observed for pts with advanced breast cancer or Black pts, but effect differences across subgroups were not statistically significant (Table). Conclusions: Among pts diagnosed with advanced cancer, the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with shorter time to systemic therapy initiation. These treatment patterns may reflect the fewer advanced cancer diagnoses and higher proportion of De novo cancers observed during this period. Longer follow-up and data maturity are needed to understand the impact of the pandemic on clinical outcomes.","Takvorian, S. U.; Parikh, R. B.; Vader, D.; Wileyto, E. P.; Clark, A. S.; Lee, D.

They broaden the scope of memory and trauma studies by examining how the East/West binary delimits horizons of “trauma” by excluding Asian texts. Are memory and trauma always reliable registers of the past that translate across cultures and nations? Are supposedly pan-human experiences of suffering disproportionately coloured by eurocentric structures of region, reason, race, or religion? How are Asian texts and cultural producers yet viewed through biased lenses? How might recent approaches and perspectives generated by Asian literary and cultural texts hold purchase in the 21st century? Critically meditating on such questions, and whether existing concepts of memory and trauma accurately address the histories, present states, and futures of the non-Occidental world, this volume unites perspectives on both dominant and marginalized sites of the broader Asian continent. Contributors explore the complex intersections of literature, history, ethics, affect, and social justice across East, South, and Southeast Asia, and on Asian diasporas in Australia and the USA. They draw on yet diverge from “Orientalism” and “Area Studies” given today’s need for nuanced analytical methodologies in an era defined by the COVID-19 global pandemic.

179344,Commentary,2021,"Purpose: We sought to understand patients care-seeking behaviours during the pandemic, their use and views of different virtual care modalities, and whether these differed by sociodemographic factors. Methods: We conducted a multi-site cross-sectional patient experience survey at thirteen academic primary care teaching practices between May and June of 2020. An anonymized link to an electronic survey was sent to a subset of patients with a valid email address on file; sampling was based on birth month. For each question, the proportion of respondents who selected each response was calculated, followed by a comparison by sociodemographic characteristics using chi-squared tests. Results: In total, 7482 participants responded to the survey. Most received care from their primary care clinic during the pandemic (67.7%, 5068/7482), the majority via phone (82.5%, 4195/5086). Among those who received care, 30.53% (1509/4943) stated that they delayed seeking care because of the pandemic. Most participants reported a high degree of comfort with phone (92.4%, 3824/4139), video (95.2%, 238/250) and email or messaging (91.3%, 794/870). However, those reporting difficulty making ends meet, poor or fair health, and arriving in Canada in the last 10 years reported lower levels of comfort with virtual care and fewer wanted their practice to continue offering virtual options after the pandemic. Conclusions: Our study suggest that newcomers, people living with a lower income, and those reporting poor or fair health have a stronger preference and comfort for in-person primary care. Further research should explore potential barriers to virtual care and how these could be addressed.","Agarwal, P.; Wang, R.; Meaney, C.; Walji, S.; Damji, A.; Gill Toor, N.; Yip, G.; Elman, D.; Florindo, T.; Fung, S.; Witty, M.; Pham, T.

This has particular importance due to COVID-19 when most assessments have taken place over the telephone. Methods: All patients were sent the Obstetric Anaesthetists’ Association (OAA) high BMI leaflet2 by text message one week before their clinic appointment. The aim was to increase patients’ knowledge base prior to the appointment. A survey was conducted to assess patients’ understanding of high BMI, the reason for their referral to the anaesthetic clinic and additional intrapartum risks posed to them. Data including timing of referral and anaesthetic clinic, specialty of referrer and patients’ BMI were collected as well as patient preferences for information dissemination. Results: 21 patients were surveyed over a nine-week period. The mean BMI was 42 kg/m2. 71% patients understood the meaning of high BMI but only 29% understood why they had been referred to the anaesthetic clinic. 48% patients claimed that they understood the additional risks but only 60% of those could actually comment on what those risks were. 62% of patients were referred to the anaesthetic clinic by a midwife but only 23% of those were at the booking appointment. The mean timing of referral was 21 weeks gestation with mean timing of the anaesthetic clinic at 28 weeks (maximum gestation was 38 weeks). 86% patients had the maternity app for online notes and would like information leaflets to be uploaded there. Discussion: Despite a limitation in case numbers, this survey shows that patients’ understanding of their reason for referra l to anaesthetic high-risk clinic and additional risks posed to them due to high BMI is generally poor. Referral to the anaesthetic clinic is not systematic resulting in some patients reviewed late in their gestation. In order to improve the antenatal anaesthetic clinic service, we have introduced several measures. These include a new electronic referral form, education of antenatal midwives to refer women at their booking appointment once height and weight have been checked and to aim for an anaesthetic clinic appointment at 24–30 weeks gestation. At the time of referral, patients are informed of the reason and directed towards information leaflets which will be uploaded onto their maternity app. We hope these measures will increase patients’ understanding and engagement with the service and we will re-evaluate them once they have been established.","Dean, A.; Arrandale, L.; Griffiths, S.; Bourke, S.",International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijoa.2021.103023,164

Although the response in general has been positive, the conditions to which families have been subjected to telework cannot be considered normal. In this context, an online survey was requested to find out the experience of confined households in relation to the dwelling adaptation and satisfaction following the new needs in lockdown. The data obtained on workspace perception and its adequacy were studied in Madrid, stratified by gender and average income, for a sample of 256 households with people teleworking or studying. The results showed that the adequacy of telework spaces were insufficient for a third of the households, without no significant relationship with most of socioeconomic variables, nor with home characteristics. The variables related to this inadequacy of the spaces were: the number of people who work or study at home;the lack of exclusive spaces for teleworking;and the availability of digital resources. This perception also depended on the qualities of the teleworking space, as size, furniture and lighting, among others.","Cuerdo-Vilches, Teresa Navas-Martín Miguel Ángel March Sebastià Oteiza Ignacio",Sustainable Cities and Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.103262,164

This new human emergent infectious disease is dominated by severe lower respiratory illness and is aetiologically linked to a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV). METHODS Pulmonary pathology and clinical correlates were investigated in seven patients who died of SARS in whom there was a strong epidemiological link. Investigations include a review of clinical features, morphological assessment, histochemical and immunohistochemical stainings, ultrastructural study, and virological investigations in postmortem tissue. RESULTS Positive viral culture for coronavirus was detected in most premortem nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens (five of six) and postmortem lung tissues (two of seven). Viral particles, consistent with coronavirus, could be detected in lung pneumocytes in most of the patients. These features suggested that pneumocytes are probably the primary target of infection. The pathological features were dominated by diffuse alveolar damage, with the presence of multinucleated pneumocytes. Fibrogranulation tissue proliferation in small airways and airspaces (bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia-like lesions) in subpleural locations was also seen in some patients. CONCLUSIONS Viable SARS-CoV could be isolated from postmortem tissues. Postmortem examination allows tissue to be sampled for virological investigations and ultrastructural examination, and when coupled with the appropriate lung morphological changes, is valuable to confirm the diagnosis of SARS-CoV, particularly in clinically unapparent or suspicious but unconfirmed cases.","Tse, G M-K; To, K-F; Chan, P K-S; Lo, A W I; Ng, K-C; Wu, A; Lee, N; Wong, H-C; Mak, S-M; Chan, K-F; Hui, D S C; Sung, J J-Y; Ng, H-K",Journal of clinical pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14990596/,164

COVID-19 is mainly manifested by respiratory symptoms,however, digestive manifestations have been reported, raising the hypothesis of the viral digestive tropism. AIMS Specify the digestive manifestations due to the SARS-CoV-2, and their impact on the disease prognosis and describe the COVID-19 effect in patients with underlying digestive disease. METHODS Ageneral review of the medical literature was conducted via Medline® database, through various combinations of the following keywords :SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, gastrointestinal tract, digestive system, inflammatory bowel diseases, liver, liver injury, chronic liver disease, neoplasms. The most relevant articles were selected. RESULTS The SARS-CoV-2 tropism for the digestive tract has been confirmed by the identification of the enterocyte as a target cell of the virus. Viral particles and RNA detection in stool of infected patients has raised the potential for feco-oral transmission of the virus. Gastrointestinal manifestations were frequent and may even be revealing or isolated. Diarrhea was the most characteristic symptom. Frequent liver involvement is associated with a more severe form of the disease. Patients with digestive cancer and chronic liver disease are at risk for a severe form of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION The clinician is required to know this type of manifestations in order to limit the delay in diagnosis and to better assess the prognosis.","Elloumi Kharrat, Hanen; Ghanem, Mohamed; Bouchabou, B; Bouali, Riadh; Elloumi, Héla",La Tunisie medicale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33480020/,164
193066,Address.,1866-01-01,"Members of the Bunyaviridae family acquire an envelope by budding through the lipid bilayer of the Golgi complex. The budding compartment is thought to be determined by the accumulation of the two heterodimeric membrane glycoproteins G1 and G2 in the Golgi. We recently mapped the retention signal for Golgi localization in one Bunyaviridae member (Uukuniemi virus) to the cytoplasmic tail of G1. We now show that a myc-tagged 81-residue G1 tail peptide expressed in BHK21 cells is efficiently targeted to the Golgi complex and retained there during a 3-h chase. Green-fluorescence protein tagged at either end with this peptide or with a C-terminally truncated 60-residue G1 tail peptide was also efficiently targeted to the Golgi. The 81-residue peptide colocalized with mannosidase II (a medial Golgi marker) and partially with p58 (an intermediate compartment marker) and TGN38 (a trans-Golgi marker). In addition, the 81-residue tail peptide induced the formation of brefeldin A-resistant vacuoles that did not costain with markers for other membrane compartments. Removal of the first 10 N-terminal residues had no effect on the Golgi localization but abolished the vacuolar staining. The shortest peptide still able to become targeted to the Golgi encompassed residues 10 to 40. Subcellular fractionation showed that the 81-residue tail peptide was associated with microsomal membranes. Removal of the two palmitylation sites from the tail peptide did not affect Golgi localization and had only a minor effect on the association with microsomal membranes. Taken together, the results provide strong evidence that Golgi retention of the heterodimeric G1-G2 spike protein complex of Uukuniemi virus is mediated by a short region in the cytoplasmic tail of the G1 glycoprotein.","Andersson, A M; Pettersson, R F",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9811692/,164
193568,Conducting an international curriculum review meeting in the age of COVID-19.,2020,"BACKGROUND The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate whether the presence of serum complement antibodies was associated with reduced one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) in adults. METHODS From a stratified random sample of 18-73 year old adults, we performed measurements of serum complement fixing virus antibodies against influenza type A and B, parainfluenza type 1, 2, and 3, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus on 82% (n = 1239). RESULTS In the crude data, subjects having five of the seven virus antibodies had significantly lower lung function, given as sex-, age- and height-standardized residuals of FEV1 (SFEV1), compared with those without. After adjusting in addition for smoking habits, lifetime smoking consumption and season, the lung function levels were significantly lower in subjects with influenza type B and respiratory syncytial virus antibodies compared to those without (P < 0.01). Increasing influenza and respiratory syncytial virus antibody titres and increasing numbers of virus antibodies, respectively, were related to progressively lower lung function. Subjects with respiratory symptoms but without obstructive lung disease had lower antibody levels than subjects with obstructive lung disease, but higher levels than asymptomatic subjects. In a final multiple linear regression analysis adjusting in addition for respiratory symptom and disease status as well as for the other respiratory virus antibodies, the presence of respiratory syncytial virus antibodies was a significant predictor for reduced SFEV1 (regression coefficient: -0.226; SE = 0.112; P = 0.04). The magnitude of the effect on lung function remained after excluding subjects reporting symptoms of respiratory infection within 3 weeks prior to the examination (regression coefficient: -0.252; SE = -0.218; P = 0.25). CONCLUSIONS This cross-sectional community study indicates that respiratory syncytial virus infection or re-infection is an independent predictor for reduced lung function in adults of a wide age range.","Omenaas, E; Bakke, P; Eide, G E; Haukenes, G; Gulsvik, A",International journal of epidemiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8666481/,164
194243,Editorial.,1902-04-15,"Genetic studies have demonstrated profound differences between the 'porcine' genotype of Cryptosporidium parvum, versus 'human' and 'bovine' genotypes. The study analysed infectivity and pathogenicity of the 'porcine' genotype (CPP-13 isolate) of C. parvum, and compared the results with published data on the 'bovine' genotype (CPB-0 isolate). This was investigated in calves and piglets from commercial herds. Piglets were mildly affected by the CPP-13 isolate, contrary to piglets infected with the CPB-0 isolate, which caused diarrhoea of a mean duration of 3.5 days. CPP-13 produced no or very mild clinical signs in piglets despite the excretion of high numbers of oocysts. Concomitant infection with rotavirus, however, caused a dramatic aggravation of the clinical signs, and 5 of 6 experimentally infected piglets died. CPP-13 appeared to be adapted to porcine hosts as illustrated by the lack of infectivity to 1 experimentally inoculated calf, and the absence of clinical signs, the long pre-patent period (15 days), and the excretion of very low numbers of oocysts following experimental infection of another calf. Thus, in accordance with other molecular studies, our results support the genetic evidence for the existence of a new species of Cryptosporidium adapted to pigs.","Enemark, H L; Ahrens, P; Bille-Hansen, V; Heegaard, P M H; Vigre, H; Thamsborg, S M; Lind, P",Parasitology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12793644/,164

Members of the genus Lyssavirus cause the invariably fatal disease rabies, and a member of the genus Vesiculovirus, Chandipura virus, has recently been associated with acute encephalitis in children. We present here the complete genome sequence and transcription map of a rhabdovirus isolated from cultivated cells of hepatocellular carcinoma tissue from a moribund tree shrew. The negative-strand genome of tupaia rhabdovirus is composed of 11,440 nucleotides and encodes six genes that are separated by one or two intergenic nucleotides. In addition to the typical rhabdovirus genes in the order N-P-M-G-L, a gene encoding a small hydrophobic putative type I transmembrane protein of approximately 11 kDa was identified between the M and G genes, and the corresponding transcript was detected in infected cells. Similar to some Vesiculoviruses and many Paramyxovirinae, the P gene has a second overlapping reading frame that can be accessed by ribosomal choice and encodes a protein of 26 kDa, predicted to be the largest C protein of these virus families. Phylogenetic analyses of the tupaia rhabdovirus N and L genes show that the virus is distantly related to the Vesiculoviruses, Ephemeroviruses, and the recently characterized Flanders virus and Oita virus and further extends the sequence territory occupied by animal rhabdoviruses.","Springfeld, Christoph; Darai, Gholamreza; Cattaneo, Roberto",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15890917/,164

METHODS Confirmed or probable cases of certain infectious diseases required to be notified to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Victoria in 2013, excluding elevated blood lead, foodborne or water-borne illness with 2 or more related cases and chlamydial infection, were analysed according to: notification source of doctor ± laboratory vs. laboratory-only; routine follow-up by public health staff for selected conditions vs. not routine; priority for Indigenous status reporting for 18 priority conditions with a target of ≥ 95% completeness vs. other conditions with a target of ≥ 80% completeness; and urgency of notification (conditions requiring immediate [same day] notification vs. conditions requiring notification within 5 days). RESULTS Almost half (49%) the 34,893 confirmed and probable cases were notified by laboratory report alone. Indigenous status was complete for 48% of cases. Indigenous status was more likely to be completed for conditions with active vs. no active follow-up (RR 1.88 (95% CI 1.84-1.92)) and priority conditions for Indigenous status reporting vs. other conditions (RR 1.62 (95% CI 1.59-1.66)). Among conditions without active follow-up, doctor-notified cases had more complete Indigenous status reporting than laboratory-only notified cases (86% vs. 6%, RR 15.06 (95% CI 14.15-16.03)). Fewer notifications requiring same day notification were received within the legislated time frame (59%) than notifications required to be notified within 5 days (90%). DISCUSSION DHHS Victoria handles a large volume of infectious disease notifications. Incomplete Indigenous status reporting, particularly for conditions without active follow-up, and delayed notification of conditions requiring immediate attention warrant attention.

196296,How will vets work with farmers post Covid?,2020-05-30,"After national case-based surveillance for pandemic influenza A (H1N1) ceased on July 23, 2009, a daily case-based surveillance system was implemented in Maebashi City, Japan. All medical facilities in the city reported all patients who had positive rapid antigen tests for influenza A. When the epidemic exploded in late October, case-based surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) was implemented from November 3, 2009 until the end of the epidemic. A total of 7,781 influenza cases were reported between July 25 and November 2, 2009, with a cumulative incidence rate of 22.5 per 1,000 population. Nearly 70% of the patients were under 15 years old. Between November 3, 2009 and the end of March 2010, a total of 16,394 ILI cases were reported, with a cumulative incidence rate of 47.4 per 1,000 population. Of the ILI cases reported, 63% were in patients younger than 15 years old. Only one death with laboratory confirmation of the H1N1 2009 virus was reported during the epidemic. The age-specific reproduction number among children under 15 years of age was almost 1.40, whereas between children and adults (15 years of age and above) it was considerably less than 1.0. The reproduction number derived from the next-generation matrix using data from September 30 to October 14 was estimated to be 1.48 (95% confidence interval, 1.41-1.56). Among individuals under 15 years of age, the infection rate calculated using the final size equation under the assumption of no mitigation measures was nearly twice the rate reported during the epidemic. These findings indicate that the majority of the transmission of influenza A (H1N1) 2009 in the city occurred among children.","Tsukui, Satoshi",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22446120/,164

197583,Inexpensive Methods for Live Imaging of Central Pattern Generator Activity in the Drosophila Larval Locomotor System.,2020,"After decades of neglect, the resurgence of tuberculosis in the United States between 1985 and 1992 renewed interest in the use of upper room ultraviolet germicidal irradiation to interrupt the transmission of airborne infections. More recently the bioterrorism threat and the appearance of new pathogens with the potential for airborne spread, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), have stimulated installations of upper-room irradiation systems. The objective is to flood the entire volume of a room above 6.5 ft with high intensity ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, while minimizing unintentional irradiance below 6.5 ft to avoid eye and skin irritation. Air exchanges between the upper and lower room result in air disinfection of the occupied space. Designers of these systems have adopted the practice of limiting the maximum lower room irradiance at every point to less than the continuous 8-hour time-weighted average threshold limit value, severely limiting the irradiation intensity in the upper room and thereby reducing one of the two major factors determining germicidal effectiveness, the other being room air mixing. The hypothesis of this study is that eye and skin exposure will be well below the recommended safe dose even when maximum eye-level irradiance levels in the room exceed the 8-hour continuous exposure threshold limit. The method employed was to have subjects wear a small photometer that recorded total ultraviolet dose over the period of exposure while subjects went about their normal routine, and comparing this value with a hypothetical dose calculated from the highest measured eye-level irradiance. The results of the study, based on a limited number of observations, confirmed the hypothesis. Observed doses were one-third to a factor of a hundred or more lower than the doses calculated from maximum eye-level irradiances measurements in the occupants' spaces.","First, Melvin W; Weker, Robert A; Yasui, Shojiro; Nardell, Edward A",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15848970/,164

As a consequence, proteomics-based efforts were developed to characterize proteins that are modified by Ub or Ubls. A more focused functional proteomics strategy relies on active-site probes based on the Ub/Ubl scaffold, which specifically targets Ub/Ubl-processing enzymes. Activity-based profiling with such tools led to the identification of novel gene products with Ub/Ubl-processing activity and uncovered novel control mechanisms regulating their activity. This review discusses recent advances in chemistry-based functional proteomics applications, and how this information can provide a framework for drug development against Ub/Ubl-processing enzymes.","Kessler, Benedikt M",Expert review of proteomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16608434/,164

Despite the paucity of data, it appears that oncology patients suffer from a higher risk of complications due to COVID-19 infection, including hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU) and death. A delicate balance exists between the oncologists' obligation to provide optimal and effective cancer treatment and the risks enveloping treatment that may place patients vulnerable to contraction of the virus. In an effort to reorganized oncological units, guidelines were published by the American and European oncology unions (ASCO, ESMO), including cancellation of frontal meetings, converting to telemedicine and changes in treatment protocols mitigating the exposure of patients to hospital visitations.

Two amino acids differed between The S proteins of these viruses; one was located in the signal sequence (amino acid 12) and the other in the putative cleavage site (amino acid 757). To determine which one of these amino acid changes is important for the alteration of fusogenicity, chimeric S proteins between MHV-2 and -2f were constructed and expressed in DBT cells by a vaccinia virus expression system. The results revealed that one amino acid change (Ser to Arg) at position 757 is responsible for the acquisition of fusogenicity of the MHV-2f S protein. This change also altered the susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage of the MHV-2 S protein which was originally uncleavable.

Also, during the initial stages of an outbreak of a new or reemerging pathogen, disease incidence tends to occur in spatial clusters, which makes containment possible if you can predict the subsequent spread of disease. Spatial models are being used with increasing frequency to help characterize these large-scale patterns and to evaluate the impact of interventions. Here, I review several recent studies on four diseases that show the benefits of different methodologies: measles (patch models), foot-and-mouth disease (distance-transmission models), pandemic influenza (multigroup models), and smallpox (network models). This review highlights the importance of the household in spatial studies of human diseases, such as smallpox and influenza. It also demonstrates the need to develop a simple model of household demographics, so that these large-scale models can be extended to the investigation of long-time scale human pathogens, such as tuberculosis and HIV.","Riley, Steven",Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17540894/,164

An ever-increasing number of surgeons desire methods that minimize surgical trauma and provide improved cosmetic outcomes. Since 2014, we have performed two-port laparoscopic surgery using a transumbilical multichannel glove port and a 12-mm port. The aim of this study was to compare the short-term surgical results of two-port laparoscopic anterior resection (TPLAR) with those of conventional laparoscopic anterior resection (CLAR) for rectal cancer. METHODS Between January 2014 and May 2014, a total of 27 patients underwent TPLAR and 30 patients underwent CLAR for the treatment of rectal cancer. The short-term surgical results of these two groups of patients were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS The differences in operative time, blood loss, conversion rate, complication rate, distal resection margin, number of harvested lymph nodes, duration until ambulation, duration until first flatus, length of postoperative hospital stay, and overall hospital costs between the two groups were not significant. The median (range) length of the abdominal incisions of the TPLAR patients was shorter than the length of the CLAR patients (5.1 (4.5-16.3) cm vs 8.2 (7.0-10.0) cm, respectively; p < 0.001). The respective median (range) postoperative pain scores were lower in the TPLAR than in the CLAR patients at 24 h (4 (1-6) h vs 5 (2-8) h; p = 0.045), 48 h (3 (1-4) h vs 4 (range 1-8) h; P = 0.004) and 72 h (1 (0-3) h vs 2 (1-5) h; p = 0.010). The median overall score on the satisfaction-with-abdominal-incision questionnaire of the TPLAR patients was significantly higher (better) than the score of the CLAR patients. CONCLUSIONS TPLAR for rectal cancer is safe and feasible, with short-term perioperative and oncological outcomes similar to those of CLAR. TPLAR provides less postoperative pain and better cosmetic outcomes.","Zhang, Hong; Ling, Yunzhi; Cong, Jinchun; Cui, Mingming; Liu, Dingsheng; Chen, Chunsheng",World journal of surgical oncology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27784311/,164

The aim of the study was to determine whether antigenically different strains of RCV vary in their pathogenic potential in rats. METHODS Neutralization groups were identified by use of RCV strain-specific antisera. Sprague Dawley rats were inoculated oronasally with RCV-SDA, RCV-BCMM, or RCV-W. Histologic examination, immunohistochemical analysis, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis were performed on tissues from infected rats. RESULTS Clinical illness was not evident in any of the inoculated rats. The RCV-SDA strain caused mild lesions in the exorbital gland of one rat. The RCV-BCMM strain caused severe lesions in the Harderian and parotid glands and mild lesions in the exorbital glands, lungs, and nasal mucosa. The RCV-W strain caused severe lesions in the Harderian, exorbital, and parotid glands and mild lesions in the submandibular glands, lungs, and nasal mucosa. The RNA concentration was highest in the Harderian, parotid, and exorbital glands of RCV-BCMM- and RCV-W-infected rats at postinoculation day 7. CONCLUSIONS Although RCV-SDA, RCV-BCMM, and RCV-W caused different degrees and patterns of lesions, neutralization groups are not useful for predicting the pathogenic potential of a new RCV isolate.","Compton, S R; Smith, A L; Gaertner, D J",Laboratory animal science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10551452/,164
202101,Sharing stories in our BVA Covid Clinics,2020,"UNLABELLED Synthesis of 2'-5'-oligoadenylates (2-5A) by oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) is an important innate cellular response that limits viral replication by activating the latent cellular RNase, RNase L, to degrade single-stranded RNA. Some rotaviruses and coronaviruses antagonize the OAS/RNase L pathway through the activity of an encoded 2H phosphoesterase domain that cleaves 2-5A. These viral 2H phosphoesterases are phylogenetically related to the cellular A kinase anchoring protein 7 (AKAP7) and share a core structure and an active site that contains two well-defined HΦ(S/T)Φ (where Φ is a hydrophobic residue) motifs, but their mechanism of substrate binding is unknown. Here, we report the structures of a viral 2H phosphoesterase, the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the group A rotavirus (RVA) VP3 protein, both alone and in complex with 2-5A. The domain forms a compact fold, with a concave β-sheet that contains the catalytic cleft, but it lacks two α-helical regions and two β-strands observed in AKAP7 and other 2H phosphoesterases. The cocrystal structure shows significant conformational changes in the R loop upon ligand binding. Bioinformatics and biochemical analyses reveal that conserved residues and residues required for catalytic activity and substrate binding comprise the catalytic motifs and a region on one side of the binding cleft. We demonstrate that the VP3 CTD of group B rotavirus, but not that of group G, cleaves 2-5A. These findings suggest that the VP3 CTD is a streamlined version of a 2H phosphoesterase with a ligand-binding mechanism that is shared among 2H phosphodiesterases that cleave 2-5A. IMPORTANCE The C-terminal domain (CTD) of rotavirus VP3 is a 2H phosphoesterase that cleaves 2'-5'-oligoadenylates (2-5A), potent activators of an important innate cellular antiviral pathway. 2H phosphoesterase superfamily proteins contain two conserved catalytic motifs and a proposed core structure. Here, we present structures of a viral 2H phosphoesterase, the rotavirus VP3 CTD, alone and in complex with its substrate, 2-5A. The domain lacks two α-helical regions and β-strands present in other 2H phosphoesterases. A loop of the protein undergoes significant structural changes upon substrate binding. Together with our bioinformatics and biochemical findings, the crystal structures suggest that the RVA VP3 CTD domain is a streamlined version of a cellular enzyme that shares a ligand-binding mechanism with other 2H phosphodiesterases that cleave 2-5A but differs from those of 2H phosphodiesterases that cleave other substrates. These findings may aid in the future design of antivirals targeting viral phosphodiesterases with cleavage specificity for 2-5A.","Ogden, Kristen M; Hu, Liya; Jha, Babal K; Sankaran, Banumathi; Weiss, Susan R; Silverman, Robert H; Patton, John T; Prasad, B V Venkataram",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25878106/,164

204118,How cartels get around lockdowns to ship drugs,2020,"OBJECTIVES: During an influenza or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that results in acute respiratory distress, the number of available ventilators will not meet demand. In 2007, the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law and Department of Health released draft Guidelines for ethical allocation of ventilators for adults. In 2015, updated guidelines were released to ensure that: (1) revisions reflect the public's values and (2) the triage protocol is substantiated by evidence-based clinical data. We summarize the development and content of the 2015 Guidelines compared with the 2007 version, emphasizing new/revised aspects of the ethical considerations and clinical protocol. METHODS: We compared the 2007 and 2015 guidelines, with particular emphasis on the ethical issues and clinical protocols. RESULTS: The 2015 Guidelines retained much of the ethical and clinical framework of the 2007 draft. The triage protocol was revised using evidence-based clinical data. Patients with the highest likelihood of short-term survival with ventilator therapy have priority access. Protocol consists of exclusion criteria, the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and periodic clinical assessments. Guidance is provided on secondary triage criteria. Other forms of medical intervention/palliative care and review of triage decisions are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The 2015 Guidelines reflect advances in medicine and societal values and provide an evidenced-based framework to save the most lives. The framework could be adapted in other emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, that require ventilators.","Han, Susie A; Koch, Valerie Gutmann",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,164

Revealing host genes essential for infection by multiple variants of SASR-CoV-2 can provide insights into the virus pathogenesis, and facilitates the development of novel broad-spectrum host-directed therapeutics. Here, employing genome-scale CRISPR screens, we provide a comprehensive data-set of cellular factors that are exploited by WT-SARS-CoV-2 as well as two additional recently emerged variants of concerns (VOCs), Alpha and Beta. These screens identified known and novel host factors critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including various components belonging to the Clathrin-dependent transport pathway, ubiquitination and Heparan sulfate biogenesis. In addition, the host metabolic pathways pertaining to mitochondrial activity as well as phosphatidylglycerol biosynthesis processes appeared to have major anti-viral functions. Comparative analysis between the different VOCs revealed the receptor KREMEN2 as unique gene required only to the Alpha variant, providing a possible explanation for the increased infectivity of this variant. Furthermore, the analysis identified GATA6, a zinc finger transcription factor, as an essential pro-viral gene for all variants inspected. We reveal that GATA6 directly regulates ACE2 transcription and is accordingly, critical for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Analysis of clinical samples collected from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals showed an elevated level of GATA6, indicating the important role GATA6 may be playing in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of GATA6 results in down-modulation of ACE2 and consequently to inhibition of the viral infectivity. Overall, we show GATA6 represents a target for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic strategies and reaffirm the value of the CRISPR loss-of-function screens in providing a list of potential new targets for therapeutic interventions.","Finkel, Yaara; Israeli, Ofir; Beth-Din, Adi; Cohen-Gihon, Inbar; Yahalom-Rone, Yfat; Paran, Nir; Israely, Tomer; Chitlaru, Theodor; Elia, Uri; Cohen, Ofer; Nemet, Ital; Kliker, Limor; Mandelboim, Michal; Stern-Ginossar, Noam; Bercovich-Kinori, Adi",,,164

We aimed to evaluate the differences in psychiatric comorbidities and life adversities between patients with RA+FM (SFM) and people with primary FM (PFM). In a cross-sectional, observational study, patients with PFM and SFM underwent a structured interview for the lifetime diagnosis of major depression (MDD), panic (PD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and were assessed for childhood/adulthood adversities and FM-related symptoms severity. Thirty patients with PFM and forty with SFM were recruited. The univariate analysis showed that the lifetime rates of MDD were significantly higher in PFM vs SFM (76.7 % and 40% respectively, p <0.003), as well as the rates of PD (50 % and 15% respectively, p <0.003), whereas there was no difference in PTSD rates. The rates of sexual abuse and physical neglect were significantly higher in PFM patients vs SFM patients (p<0.005 and p<0.023). Life events occurring before FM onset were different in PFM and SFM groups. In the logistic regression model, lifetime PD and physical neglect remain independent risk factors for PFM. PFM and SFM differ in psychiatric comorbidities and environmental adversities, suggesting that common pathogenesis may develop through different pathways. This article is protected by copyright.

208859,Daily briefing: What we know about COVID-19 immunity,2020,"Osteoporosis is a chronic condition that reflects reduced bone strength and an associated increased risk for fracture. As a chronic condition, osteoporosis generally requires sustained medical intervention(s) to limit the risks for additional bone loss, compromise of skeletal integrity, and fracture occurrence. Further complicating this issue is the fact that the abrupt cessation of some therapies can be associated with an increased risk for harm. It is in this context that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented disruption to the provision of health care globally, including near universal requirements for social distancing. In this Perspective, we provide evidence, where available, regarding the general care of patients with osteoporosis in the COVID-19 era and provide clinical recommendations based primarily on expert opinion when data are absent. Particular emphasis is placed on the transition from parenteral osteoporosis therapies. It is hoped that these recommendations can be used to safely guide care for patients with osteoporosis until a return to routine clinical care standards is available. © 2020 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.","Yu, Elaine W; Tsourdi, Elena; Clarke, Bart L; Bauer, Douglas C; Drake, Matthew T",J Bone Miner Res,,164

Whether rapid point-of-care antigen lateral flow devices (LFDs) detect most potential transmission sources despite imperfect clinical sensitivity is unknown. METHODS: We combined SARS-CoV-2 testing and contact tracing data from England between 01-September-2020 and 28-February-2021. We used multivariable logistic regression to investigate relationships between PCR-confirmed infection in contacts of community-diagnosed cases and index case viral load, S gene target failure (proxy for B.1.1.7 infection), demographics, SARS-CoV-2 incidence, social deprivation, and contact event type. We used LFD performance to simulate the proportion of cases with a PCR-positive contact expected to be detected using one of four LFDs. RESULTS: 231,498/2,474,066(9%) contacts of 1,064,004 index cases tested PCR-positive. PCR-positive results in contacts independently increased with higher case viral loads (lower Ct values) e.g., 11.7%(95%CI 11.5-12.0%) at Ct=15 and 4.5%(4.4-4.6%) at Ct=30. B.1.1.7 infection increased PCR-positive results by ~50%, (e.g. 1.55-fold, 95%CI 1.49-1.61, at Ct=20). PCR-positive results were most common in household contacts (at Ct=20.1, 8.7%[95%CI 8.6-8.9%]), followed by household visitors (7.1%[6.8-7.3%]), contacts at events/activities (5.2%[4.9-5.4%]), work/education (4.6%[4.4-4.8%]), and least common after outdoor contact (2.9%[2.3-3.8%]). Contacts of children were the least likely to test positive, particularly following contact outdoors or at work/education. The most and least sensitive LFDs would detect 89.5%(89.4-89.6%) and 83.0%(82.8-83.1%) of cases with PCR-positive contacts respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infectivity varies by case viral load, contact event type, and age. Those with high viral loads are the most infectious. B.1.1.7 increased transmission by ~50%. The best performing LFDs detect most infectious cases.","Lee, Lennard Y W; Rozmanowski, Stefan; Pang, Matthew; Charlett, Andre; Anderson, Charlotte; Hughes, Gareth J; Barnard, Matthew; Peto, Leon; Vipond, Richard; Sienkiewicz, Alex; Hopkins, Susan; Bell, John; Crook, Derrick W; Gent, Nick; Walker, A Sarah; Peto, Tim E A; Eyre, David W",Clin. infect. dis,,164

Despite the tremendous international effort and the launch of various clinical trials for the containment of this pandemic, no effective therapy has been proven yet. Recent Findings: This review has highlighted the different traditional therapeutic techniques, along with the potential contribution of nanomedicine against the severe acute respiratory syndrome corovirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Repositioning of the drugs, such as remdesivir and chloroquine, is a rapid process for the reach of safe therapeutics, and the related clinical trials have determined effects against COVID-19. Various protein-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates have successfully entered clinical phases, determining positive results. The self-assembled and metallic nanovaccines mostly based on the antigenic properties of spike (S) protein are also approachable, feasible, and promising techniques for lowering the viral burden. Summary: There are number of NP-based diagnostic systems have been reported for coronaviruses (CoVs) and specifically for SARS-CoV-2.

The COVID-19 pandemic represents a situation with a high amount of stress exposure, which in turn may be associated with negative emotional outcome like depressive symptoms. The current study investigated if resilience moderated the effect of stress on symptoms of depression and if anxiety symptoms mediated this association. An adult sample of community controls completed the Perceived stress scale 14 (PSS-14), the Resilience scale for adults (RSA), the Patient health questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7). Independent samples t-test, correlation analyses and moderated mediation analyses were conducted. The results showed that resilience moderated the relations between stress and anxiety symptoms (ß = -0.131, p < 0.001) as well as between stress and depressive symptoms (ß = -0.068, p < 0.05). In support of a moderated mediation model, resilience moderated the indirect effect of stress on depressive symptom, as confirmed by the index of moderated mediation (IMM = -0.036, p < 0.001; [95% BCa: -0.055, -0.020]). The high resilience subgroup was less affected than the low resilience subgroup by the effect of stress exposure symptoms of depression, mediated by anxiety. The study shows that stress exposure is associated with symptoms of depression, and anxiety mediates this association. Level of resilience differentiates the direct and indirect effect of stress on depression. Knowledge about the effect of stress in response to a pandemic is important for developing treatment and prevention strategies for stress, depression and health-related anxiety.","Havnen, Audun; Anyan, Frederick; Hjemdal, Odin; Solem, Stian; Gurigard Riksfjord, Maja; Hagen, Kristen",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,164
212835,How swamped preprint servers are blocking bad coronavirus research,2020,"Aims A second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic may force many health care providers to downscale their services again,including colonoscopies which may impact capacity for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. This study aimed to determinethe optimal measure to handle these temporary shortages in colonoscopy capacity in the Dutch national CRC screeningprogram to retain as much of the preventive effect of the screening program as possible. Methods We used the MISCAN-Colon model to simulate the Dutch national CRC screening program, providing biennial FITto individuals aged 55-75, under three different scenarios to temporarily reduce required colonoscopy capacity in thesecond half of 2020 and 2021: increase in FIT cut-off value exclusion of specific age-groups, and extension of the screening interval For each scenario, we estimated the impact on required colonoscopy capacity in 2020-2021, long-term CRC incidence,mortality and life years (LYs) lost. Outcomes were compared to a reference scenario without colonoscopy restrictions. Results In 2020 and 2021, the required colonoscopy capacity without any restrictions was 100,300 colonoscopies.Increasing the cut-off, excluding age-groups and extending the screening interval resulted in a reduction of 11,600-27,000,10,800-17,500, and 16,100-49,500 colonoscopies, respectively (Table 1). Increasing the cut-off resulted in 400-900 excessCRC cases and 200-500 excess CRC-related deaths from 2020-2050, while excluding age-groups resulted in 200-600excess CRC cases and 200-500 excess CRC-related deaths. Unexpectedly, extending the screening interval up to 34 months prevented 200-300 more CRC cases and 200-600 more CRC-related deaths, because screening occurred until slightlyhigher ages due to the initial delay. All measures resulted in LYs lost, but extending the screening interval up to 34 monthshad the smallest impact.

However, the incidence of fungal co-infection in COVID-19 patients remains unclear. To investigate the association between fungal co-infection and mortality due to COVID-19, we systematically searched Medline, Embase, MedRxiv and Cochrane Library for eligible studies published in the period from 1 January to 1 December 2020. We performed a meta-analysis of nine studies that met the inclusion criteria. In total, data from 2780 patients and 426 patients were included who were admitted to the ICU. In eight of the articles, 211 participants died due to COVID-19 infection, which means an overall mortality rate of 10.9%. The overall pooled proportion of fungal co-infection in COVID-19 patients was 0.12 (95% CI = 0.07-0.16, n = 2780, I2 = 96.8%). In terms of mortality in COVID-19 patients with fungal infection, the overall pooled proportion of mortality was 0.17 (95% CI = 0.10-0.24, n = 1944, I2 = 95.6%). These findings provide evidence suggesting a favorable use for empirical antibiotics in the majority of patients when COVID-19 infection is diagnosed.

Identifying and understanding populations at a heightened risk of acquisition is essential to more effectively target outreach and prevention efforts. Objective: This study aimed to compare sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of pregnant women with and without severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and, among those with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, to compare characteristics of those who reported coronavirus disease symptoms and those who were asymptomatic at diagnosis. Study Design: This retrospective cohort study includes pregnant women who delivered or intended to deliver at Northwestern Memorial Hospital after initiation of a universal testing protocol on admission (April 8, 2020-May 31, 2020). Women were dichotomized by whether they had a positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Among women with a positive test result, women were further dichotomized by whether they reported symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019. Bivariable analysis and parametric tests of trend were used for analyses. Logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders and to examine effect modification between race and ethnicity and any other identified risk factors. Results: During the study period, 1418 women met inclusion criteria, of whom 101 (7.1%) had a positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Of the 101 women who had a positive test result, 77 (76.2%) were symptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Compared with women who had a negative test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, those with a positive test result were younger and were more likely to have public insurance, to identify as black or African American or Latina, to be unmarried, to be obese, to have preexisting pulmonary disease, and to have living children. An increasing number of living children was associated with an increasing risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and this finding persisted after controlling for potential confounders. There was no effect modification between race or ethnicity and having living children with regard to the risk of infection. There were no significant differences identified between women who were symptomatic and asymptomatic. Conclusion: Many risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in pregnancy are similar to the social and structural determinants of health that have been reported in the general population. The observed association between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and having children raises the possibility of children themselves being vectors of viral spread or behavior patterns of parents being mediators of acquisition.","Sakowicz, Allie; Ayala, Alexander E; Ukeje, Chideraa C; Witting, Celeste S; Grobman, William A; Miller, Emily S",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,,164

The main idea is to model the epidemics as a stochastic dynamic system and to select the individual to be tested accordingly to some optimality criteria, e.g. to minimize the probability of undetected asymptomatic cases. Every day, the probability of infection of the different individuals is updated making use of the stochastic model of the phenomenon and of the information collected in the previous day. Simulations for a closed community of 10000 individuals show that the proposed technique, coupled with a selective confinement policy, can reduce the spread of the disease while limiting the number of individuals confined if compared to random strategies.","Pezzutto, Matthias; Rossello, Nicolas Bono; Schenato, Luca; Garone, Emanuele",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15412v1.pdf,164

221807,Stabilisierende Wirkungen durch Kurzarbeit,2021,"Objective: A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2), emerged in December 2019 and soon led to a worldwide pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 has been shown to cause several neurological manifestations including ischemic strokes. Stroke is one of the chronic diseases with very high morbidity and mortality causing a huge financial burden to the healthcare economy. The purpose of this study is to explore if patients with prior ischemic stroke are a vulnerable population for worse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Background: It is uncertain if patients with prior ischemic stroke are vulnerable to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its complications. Design/Methods: We used TriNetX, a global health collaborative clinical research platform with a large global COVID-19 database. COVID-19 infection was identified with a positive lab value for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and related ribonucleic acid (RNA). Results: A total of 604,258 patients with history of ischemic stroke were identified, of which 891 patients (study cohort) were diagnosed with COVID-19. A control cohort with 32,136 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 after January 20th 2020 without a history of ischemic stroke were identified. A comparison between study cohort and control cohort showed patients with prior history of stroke (study cohort) were older (69.5 vs 47.8;p<0.0001) and had more comorbidities contributing to worse clinical outcomes. After propensity matching for demographic variables and comorbidities, only rate of hospitalization (287 vs 231;p=0.0035) and need for critical care services (85 vs 55;p=0.0082) remained statistically significant while intubation (51 vs 43;p=0.39) and death (119 vs 115;p=0.77) showed trends towards worse outcomes but were not statistically significant Conclusions: Patients with history of ischemic stroke tend to be significantly older with several comorbid conditions contributing to worse clinical outcomes after COVID-19, which makes them a vulnerable population.","Tommee, C.

Data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of infected patients in urban communities in the US are limited. Objectives: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to perform a comparative analysis of hospitalized and ambulatory patient populations. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study is a case series of 463 consecutive patients with COVID-19 evaluated at Henry Ford Health System in metropolitan Detroit, Michigan, from March 9 to March 27, 2020. Data analysis was performed from March to April 2020. Exposure: Laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic data, underlying comorbidities, clinical presentation, complications, treatment, and outcomes were collected. Results: Of 463 patients with COVID-19 (mean [SD] age, 57.5 [16.8] years), 259 (55.9%) were female, and 334 (72.1%) were African American. Most patients (435 [94.0%]) had at least 1 comorbidity, including hypertension (295 patients [63.7%]), chronic kidney disease (182 patients [39.3%]), and diabetes (178 patients [38.4%]). Common symptoms at presentation were cough (347 patients [74.9%]), fever (315 patients [68.0%]), and dyspnea (282 patients [60.9%]). Three hundred fifty-five patients (76.7%) were hospitalized; 141 (39.7%) required intensive care unit management and 114 (80.8%) of those patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. Male sex (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-3.2; P = .001), severe obesity (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-3.6; P = .02), and chronic kidney disease (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-3.3; P = .006) were independently associated with intensive care unit admission. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit had longer length of stay and higher incidence of respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, shock, and mortality (57 patients [40.4%] vs 15 patients [7.0%]) compared with patients in the general practice unit. Twenty-nine (11.2%) of those discharged from the hospital were readmitted and, overall, 20.0% died within 30 days.

225709,Rotation as contagion mitigation,2021,"At the time of preparing this Perspective, large-scale vaccination for COVID-19 is in progress, aiming to bring the pandemic under control through vaccine-induced herd immunity. Not only does this vaccination effort represent an unprecedented scientific and technological breakthrough, moving us from the rapid analysis of viral genomes to design, manufacture, clinical trial testing, and use authorization within the time frame of less than a year, but it also highlights rapid progress in the implementation of nanotechnology to assist vaccine development. These advances enable us to deliver nucleic acid and conformation-stabilized subunit vaccines to regional lymph nodes, with the ability to trigger effective humoral and cellular immunity that prevents viral infection or controls disease severity. In addition to a brief description of the design features of unique cationic lipid and virus-mimicking nanoparticles for accomplishing spike protein delivery and presentation by the cognate immune system, we also discuss the importance of adjuvancy and design features to promote cooperative B- and T-cell interactions in lymph node germinal centers, including the use of epitope-based vaccines. Although current vaccine efforts have demonstrated short-term efficacy and vaccine safety, key issues are now vaccine durability and adaptability against viral variants. We present a forward-looking perspective of how vaccine design can be adapted to improve durability of the immune response and vaccine adaptation to overcome immune escape by viral variants. Finally, we consider the impact of nano-enabled approaches in the development of COVID-19 vaccines for improved vaccine design against other infectious agents, including pathogens that may lead to future pandemics.","Nel, André E; Miller, Jeff F",ACS Nano,,164

Through analyzing a random sample (n = 400) of Parler posts using the hashtags #COVID19Vaccine and #NoCovidVaccine, we use the concept of echo chambers to understand users’ discussions through a text analytics approach. Thematic analysis reveals five key themes: reasons to refuse the COVID-19 vaccine (40%), side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine (28%), population control through the COVID-19 vaccine (23%), children getting vaccinated without parental consent (5%), and comparison of other health issues with COVID-19 (2%). Textual analysis shows that the most frequently used words in the corpus were: nocovidvaccine (348);vaccine (264);covid (184);covid19 (157);and vaccines (128). These findings suggest that users adopted different terms and hashtags to express their beliefs regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Further, findings revealed that users used certain hashtags such as “echo” to encourage like-minded people to reinforce their existing beliefs on COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and vaccine acceptance. These findings have implications for public health communication in attempts to correct false narratives on social media platforms. Through widely sharing the scientific findings of COVID-19 vaccine-related studies can help individuals understand the COVID-19 vaccines efficacy accurately.","Baines, Annalise Ittefaq Muhammad Abwao Mauryne",Vaccines,,164

We developed a comprehensive mathematical framework based on the known mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, incorporating the renin-angiotensin system and ACE2, which the virus exploits for cellular entry, key elements of the innate and adaptive immune responses, the role of inflammatory cytokines and the coagulation cascade for thrombus formation. The model predicts the evolution of viral load, immune cells, cytokines, thrombosis, and oxygen saturation based on patient baseline condition and the presence of co-morbidities. Model predictions were validated with clinical data from healthy people and COVID-19 patients, and the results were used to gain insight into identified risk factors of disease progression including older age, co-morbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, and dysregulated immune response &lt;sup&gt;1,2&lt;/sup&gt; .

Early identification of polarized topics is thus an urgent matter that can help mitigate conflict. However, accurate measurement of topic-wise polarization is still an open research challenge. To address this gap, we propose Partisanship-aware Contextualized Topic Embeddings (PaCTE), a method to automatically detect polarized topics from partisan news sources. Specifically, utilizing a language model that has been finetuned on recognizing partisanship of the news articles, we represent the ideology of a news corpus on a topic by corpus-contextualized topic embedding and measure the polarization using cosine distance. We apply our method to a dataset of news articles about the COVID-19 pandemic. Extensive experiments on different news sources and topics demonstrate the efficacy of our method to capture topical polarization, as indicated by its effectiveness of retrieving the most polarized topics.","He, Zihao; Mokhberian, Negar; Camara, Antonio; Abeliuk, Andres; Lerman, Kristina",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07814v2.pdf,164

But few studies have empirically examined the factors driving these outcomes in Africa. Our study examined associations between perceived preparedness to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and healthcare worker stress and burnout and identified potential mediating factors among healthcare workers in Ghana. METHODS: Healthcare workers in Ghana completed a cross-sectional self-administered online survey from April to May 2020; 414 and 409 completed stress and burnout questions, respectively. Perceived preparedness, stress, and burnout were measured using validated psychosocial scales. We assessed associations using linear regressions with robust standard errors. RESULTS: The average score for preparedness was 24 (SD = 8.8), 16.3 (SD = 5.9) for stress, and 37.4 (SD = 15.5) for burnout. In multivariate analysis, healthcare workers who felt somewhat prepared and prepared had lower stress (ß = -1.89, 95% CI: -3.49 to -0.30 and ß = -2.66, 95% CI: -4.48 to -0.84) and burnout (ß = -7.74, 95% CI: -11.8 to -3.64 and ß = -9.25, 95% CI: -14.1 to -4.41) scores than those who did not feel prepared. Appreciation from management and family support were associated with lower stress and burnout, while fear of infection was associated with higher stress and burnout. Fear of infection partially mediated the relationship between perceived preparedness and stress/burnout, accounting for about 16 to 17% of the effect. CONCLUSIONS: Low perceived preparedness to respond to COVID-19 increases stress and burnout, and this is partly through fear of infection. Interventions, incentives, and health systemic changes to increase healthcare workers' morale and capacity to respond to the pandemic are needed.","Afulani, Patience A; Gyamerah, Akua O; Nutor, Jerry J; Laar, Amos; Aborigo, Raymond A; Malechi, Hawa; Sterling, Mona; Awoonor-Williams, John K",PLoS One,,164

However, the source, pathways, and influence factors of house dust and the association of house dust with child inflammation in an e-waste recycling area are not well-known. This study investigated dust trace elements in children's living environment and the associations of house dust trace elements with influence factors and child inflammation. A total of 108 dust samples from children's residences, roads, and kindergartens in Guiyu (an exposed area) and Haojiang and Shantou urban areas (reference areas) were collected and analyzed, as well as children's questionnaire data. The Mann-Whitney U test found there were higher trace element concentrations in road dust (Co, Ni, and Cu), kindergarten dust (Al, V, Mn, Co, Ni, and Zn), and house dust (V, Co, Cu, As, and Cd) in Guiyu than in Haojiang and Shantou urban areas (P < 0.05). Our analysis showed that house dust and road dust have similar distribution patterns of trace elements. Spearman's correlations showed close relationships among quantities of trace elements (P < 0.05). Higher trace element concentrations in dust were found in houses that used indoor shoe cabinets and opened windows frequently (P < 0.05). In houses of children with airway inflammation, higher dust Ba concentrations were found (P < 0.05), and if their fathers did not work with e-waste, we found higher dust Pb concentrations (Mann-Whitney U test, P < 0.05). Health assessments showed a high risk of exposure through ingestion and an acceptable risk of exposure through inhalation of dust trace elements for children. However, relationships between airway inflammation and house dust trace elements showed the inhalation risk might be underestimated. This study suggests trace element exposure via dust poses a health risk for children living in e-waste recycling areas.","Xu, Ruibin; Zheng, Xiangbin; Lin, Yucong; Lin, Ciming; Guo, Yufeng; Huo, Xia",Sci Total Environ,,164

Although many previous authors have analysed factors affecting observed variations in travel demand, only a few works have focused on predictions of future new normal conditions when people will be allowed to decide whether to travel or not, although risk mitigation measures will still be enforced on vehicles, and innovative mobility services will be implemented. In addition, few authors have considered future mandatory trips of students that constitute a great part of everyday travels and are fundamental for the development of society. In this paper, logistic regression models were calibrated by using data from a revealed and stated-preferences mobility survey administered to students and employees at the University of Padova (Italy), to predict variables impacting on their decisions to perform educational and working trips in the new normal phase. Results highlighted that these factors are different between students and employees;furthermore, available travel alternatives and specific risk mitigation measures on vehicles were found to be significant. Moreover, the promotion of the use of bikes, as well as bike sharing, car pooling and micro mobility among students can effectively foster sustainable mobility habits. On the other hand, countermeasures on studying/working places resulted in a slight effect on travel decisions.","Ceccato, Riccardo Rossi Riccardo Gastaldi Massimiliano",Sustainability,,164

To address evidence gaps in COVID-19 mortality inequities resulting from inadequate race/ethnicity data and no socioeconomic data.Methods. We analyzed age-standardized death rates in Massachusetts by weekly time intervals, comparing rates for January 1 to May 19, 2020, with the corresponding historical average for 2015 to 2019 stratified by zip code social metrics.Results. At the surge peak (week 16, April 15-21), mortality rate ratios (comparing 2020 vs 2015-2019) were 2.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4, 3.5) and 2.7 (95% CI = 1.4, 5.5) for the lowest and highest zip code tabulation area (ZCTA) poverty categories, respectively, with the 2020 peak mortality rate 1.1 (95% CI = 1.0, 1.3) times higher in the highest than the lowest poverty ZCTA. Similarly, rate ratios were significantly elevated for the highest versus lowest quintiles with respect to household crowding (1.7; 95% CI = 1.0, 2.9), racialized economic segregation (3.1; 95% CI = 1.8, 5.3), and percentage population of color (1.8; 95% CI = 1.6, 2.0).Conclusions.

236944,Robert May (1936–2020),2020,"The first person-to-person transmission of the 2019 novel coronavirus in Italy on 21 February 2020 led to an infection chain that represents one of the largest known COVID-19 outbreaks outside Asia. In northern Italy in particular, we rapidly experienced a critical care crisis due to a shortage of intensive care beds, as we expected according to data reported in China. Based on our experience of managing this surge, we produced this review to support other healthcare services in preparedness and training of hospitals during the current coronavirus outbreak. We had a dedicated task force that identified a response plan, which included: (1) establishment of dedicated, cohorted intensive care units for COVID-19-positive patients; (2) design of appropriate procedures for pre-triage, diagnosis and isolation of suspected and confirmed cases; and (3) training of all staff to work in the dedicated intensive care unit, in personal protective equipment usage and patient management. Hospital multidisciplinary and departmental collaboration was needed to work on all principles of surge capacity, including: space definition; supplies provision; staff recruitment; and ad hoc training. Dedicated protocols were applied where full isolation of spaces, staff and patients was implemented. Opening the unit and the whole hospital emergency process required the multidisciplinary, multi-level involvement of healthcare providers and hospital managers all working towards a common goal: patient care and hospital safety. Hospitals should be prepared to face severe disruptions to their routine and it is very likely that protocols and procedures might require re-discussion and updating on a daily basis.","Carenzo, L; Costantini, E; Greco, M; Barra, F L; Rendiniello, V; Mainetti, M; Bui, R; Zanella, A; Grasselli, G; Lagioia, M; Protti, A; Cecconi, M",Anaesthesia,,164
237780,'A bloody mess': Confusion reigns over naming of new COVID variants,2021,"This study aims to explore the freight demand network spatial patterns in six provinces of central China from the perspective of the spread of the epidemic and the freight imbalance and breakout. To achieve this purpose, the big data of ""cart search"" demand information provided by small and medium freight enterprises on the freight information platform are analyzed. 343,690 pieces of freight demand big data on the freight information platform and Python, ArcGIS, UCINET, and Gephi software are used. The results show that: (1) The choke-point of unbalanced freight demand network is Wuhan, and the secondary choke-points are Hefei and Zhengzhou. (2) In southern China, a chain reaction circle of freight imbalance is formed with Wuhan, Hefei, and Nanchang as the centers. In northern China, a chain reaction circle of freight imbalance is formed with Zhengzhou and Taiyuan as the centers. (3) The freight demand of the six provinces in central China exhibits typical characteristics of long tail distribution with large span and unbalanced distribution. (4) The import and export of freight in different cities vary greatly, and the distribution is unbalanced. This study indicates the imbalance difference, chain reaction, keys and hidden troubles posed by the freight demand network. From the perspectives of freight transfer breakout, freight balance breakout, freight strength breakout, and breakout of freight periphery cities, we propose solutions to breakouts in the freight market in six provinces of central China in the post-epidemic era.","Huang, Yin; Liu, Runda; Huang, Shumin; Yang, Gege; Zhang, Xiaofan; Qin, Yin; Mao, Lisha; Sheng, Sishi; Huang, Biao",PLoS One,,164

It is a complex multifactorial pathological condition influenced by infectious, nutritional and environmental factors. The present study focused on analyzing the pathological and molecular characterization of bovine rotavirus A (BoRVA) during a diarrhea outbreak in a beef cattle herd located in the state of Mato Grosso, central-western region, Brazil. The outbreak caused high morbidity (80%) and mortality (12%) among 1,100 calves up to 30 days of age. The BoRVA was identified in 53.3% (16/30) of the diarrheic fecal samples analyzed using the silver-stained polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (ss-PAGE) technique. The nucleotide sequence analysis of VP7 (G genotype) and VP4 (P genotype) via RT-PCR from eight BoRVA-positive fecal samples showed the genotypes G6P[5] (n = 6), G6P[11] (n = 1) and G6P[X] (n = 1). Three calves were necropsied and the gross findings included edema and thickened, wrinkled bowel mucosa in the small intestine. Microscopic lesions were confined to the villi of the small intestine, characterized mainly by villus fusion and moderate multifocal lymphoplasmacytic enteritis. Immunohistochemical examination of three cases was positive for BoRVA. The 53.3% of the diarrheic fecal samples that were positive for BoRVA in this study suggested that RV was the etiological agent involved in this neonatal calf diarrhea outbreak.(AU)","Rondelli, André Luiz H; Rondelli, Leilane Aparecida S; Monteiro, Bruna R.

A continued state of crisis has been met with poor public adherence to preventive measures and difficulty implementing public health policy. This study aims to identify and evaluate the factors underlying such a response. Thus, it assesses the knowledge, perceived risk, and trust in the sources of information in relation to the novel coronavirus disease at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire was completed between March 20 and 27, 2020. Knowledge, perceptions, and perceived risk (Likert scale) were assessed for 737 literate participants of a representative sample in an urban setting. We found that respondents' risk perception for novel coronavirus disease was high. The perceived risk score for both cognitive and affective domains was raised at 2.24 ± 1.3 (eight items) and 3.01 ± 1 (seven items) respectively. Misconceptions and gaps in knowledge regarding COVID-19 were noted. Religious leadership was the least trusted (10%) while health authorities were the most trusted (35%) sources of information. Our findings suggest that there was a deficiency in knowledge and high concern about the pandemic, leading to a higher risk perception, especially in the affective domain. Thus, we recommend comprehensive education programs, planned intensive risk communication, and a concerted effort by all stakeholders to mitigate the spread of disease. The first of its kind in the region, this study will be critical to response efforts against current and future outbreaks.","Haque, Ayesha; Mumtaz, Sadaf; Mumtaz, Rafia; Masood, Farheen; Buksh, Hudebia Allah; Ahmed, Amal; Khattak, Osama",Journal of epidemiology and global health (Online),,164

241427,The Burden of Stigma,2020,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Manual contouring of spinal rods is often required intraoperatively for proper alignment of the rods within the pedicle screw heads. Residual misalignments are frequently reduced by using dedicated reduction devices. The forces exerted by these devices, however, are uncontrolled and may lead to excessive reaction forces. As a consequence, screw pullout might be provoked and surrounding tissue may experience unfavorable biomechanical loads. The corresponding loads and induced tissue deformations are however not well identified. Additionally, whether the forced reduction alters the biomechanical behavior of the lumbar spine during physiological movements postoperatively, remains unexplored. PURPOSE: To predict whether the reduction of misaligned posterior instrumentation might result in clinical complications directly after reduction and during a subsequent physiological flexion movement. STUDY DESIGN: Finite element analysis. METHODS: A patient-specific, total lumbar (L1-S1) spine finite element model was available from previous research. The model consists of poro-elastic intervertebral discs with Pfirrmann grade-dependent material parameters, with linear elastic bone tissue with stiffness values related to the local bone density, and with the seven major ligaments per spinal motion segment described as nonlinear materials. Titanium instrumentation was implemented in this model to simulate a L4, L5, and S1 posterolateral fusion. Next, coronal and sagittal misalignments of 6 mm each were introduced between the rod and the screw head at L4. These misalignments were computationally reduced and a physiological flexion movement of 15° was prescribed. Non-instrumented and well-aligned instrumented models were used as control groups. RESULTS: Pulling forces up to 1.0 kN were required to correct the induced misalignments of 6 mm. These forces affected the posture of the total lumbar spine, as motion segments were predicted to rotate up to 3 degrees and rotations propagated proximally to and even affect the L1-2 level. The facet contact pressures in the corrected misaligned models were asymmetrical suggesting non-physiological joint loading in the misaligned models. In addition, the discs and vertebrae experienced abnormally high forces as a result of the correction procedure. These effects were more pronounced after a 15° flexion movement following forced reduction. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that the correction of misaligned posterior instrumentation can result in high forces at the screws consistent with those reported to cause screw pullout, and may cause high-tissue strains in adjacent and downstream spinal segments. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Proper alignment of spinal posterior instrumentation may reduce clinical complications secondary to unfavorable biomechanics.","Loenen, Arjan C Y; Noriega, David C; Ruiz Wills, Carlos; Noailly, Jérôme; Nunley, Pierce D; Kirchner, Rainer; Ito, Keita; van Rietbergen, Bert",Spine j,,164

However, HCTs for COVID-19 pose ethical and practical challenges, in part due to the unclear and developing risks. In this article , we introduce an interactive model for exploring some risks of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) dosing study, a prerequisite for any COVID-19 challenge trials. The risk estimates we use are based on a Bayesian evidence synthesis model which can incorporate new data on infection fatality risks (IFRs) to patients, and infer rates of hospitalization. The model estimates individual risk, which we then extrapolate to overall mortality and hospitalization risk in a dosing study. We provide a web tool to explore risk under different study designs. Based on the Bayesian model, IFR for someone between 20 and 30 years of age is 15.1 in 100,000, with a 95% uncertainty interval from 11.8 to 19.2, while risk of hospitalization is 130 per 100,000 (100-160). However, risk will be reduced in an HCT via screening for comorbidities, selecting lower-risk population, and providing treatment. Accounting for this with stronger assumptions, we project the fatality risk to be as low as 2.5 per 100,000 (1.6-3.9) and the hospitalization risk to be 22.0 per 100,000 (14.0-33.7). We therefore find a 50-person dosing trial has a 99.74% (99.8-99.9%) chance of no fatalities, and a 98.9% (98.3-99.3%) probability of no cases requiring hospitalization.","Manheim, David; WiÈ©cek, Witold; Schmit, Virginia; Morrison, Josh",Risk Anal,,164

Aim of the present study is to assess epidemiological and clinical characteristics of individuals with DS deceased in Italian hospitals with CoVID-19. METHODS: We used a nationwide database of 3,438 patients deceased with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italy (10.4% of all deaths with CoVID-19 in the country at the time of analysis). Data on demographics, pre-existing comorbidities and in-hospital complications leading to death were extracted from medical charts obtained from hospitals. Data on individuals with DS deceased with CoVID-19 were obtained from this sample. RESULTS: Sixteen cases of death in individuals with DS (0.5% of all charts analyzed) were identified. Acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred in all 16 cases. Compared with individuals without DS, those with DS deceased with CoVID-19 were younger (52.3 ± 7.3 vs. 78.1 ± 10.6 years, p < .001) and presented a higher incidence of superinfections (31.2 vs. 13.0%, p = .029). Autoimmune diseases (43.8 vs. 4%, p < .001), obesity (37.5 vs. 11%, p = .009), and dementia (37.5 vs. 16.3%, p = .012) were more prevalent in individuals with DS. ICU admissions was similar in both groups (25 vs. 18.8%, p = .129). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with DS deceased with CoVID-19 are younger than individuals without DS. Comorbidity burden and increased risk of complications (i.e., bacterial superinfections) can influence CoVID-19 prognosis in individuals with DS.

Recent studies revealed that ApoE, a protein encoded by APOE gene, may increase the risk of severe COVID-19 cases. ApoE has been involved with prevention of tissue damage and promotion of adaptative immune response in the lungs. This study investigated frequencies distribution of alleles that alter the ApoE expression in lung tissues to trace a profile of these variants and associate them to COVID-19 clinical outcomes. Data about APOE expression levels was obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project and the allele frequencies of APOE variants was acquired from the populations included in the phase 3 release of the 1000 Genomes Project. A total of 128 variants showed a significant impact on the APOE expression in lung tissues (p &lt; 0.0001). Linkage Disequilibrium analysis revealed that 98 variants were closely grouped into seven distinct haplotype blocks, of which six were composed of variants that significantly decrease APOE gene expression in the lungs. Most of the haplotypes with higher impact on APOE expression showed greater frequencies in Europeans and lower in Africans, which implies that European populations might be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present study indicates a potential genetic contribution of APOE expression-modifying variants in modulating the prognosis of COVID-19.","Rodrigues, J. C. G.; Pinto, P.; Leitao, L. P.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence of the effectiveness of child protection practice models in improving outcomes for children and families. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Children < 18 years and their families involved in child protection services. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to synthesize evidence regarding the effectiveness of child protection practice models. Systematic searches across 10 electronic databases and grey literature were conducted to identify quasi-experimental studies minimally. Included studies were critically appraised and the findings summarized narratively. RESULTS: Five papers, representing six studies, focusing on three practice models (Solution-Based Casework; Signs of Safety; and Reclaiming Social Work) met the inclusion criteria. All studies applied a quasi-experimental design. Overall, the quality of the evidence was rated as being poor, with studies suffering from a risk of selection bias, small sample sizes and short-term follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the popularity of practice models, the evidence base for their effectiveness is still limited.

To understand this crisis, physicians and public health researchers have searched history for insights, especially from a great outbreak approximately a century ago: the 1918 influenza pandemic. However, of the accounts examining the 1918 influenza pandemic and COVID-19, only a notable few discuss race. Yet, a rich, broader scholarship on race and epidemic disease as a ""sampling device for social analysis"" exists. This commentary examines the historical arc of the 1918 influenza pandemic, focusing on black Americans and showing the complex and sometimes surprising ways it operated, triggering particular responses both within a minority community and in wider racial, sociopolitical, and public health structures. This analysis reveals that critical structural inequities and health care gaps have historically contributed to and continue to compound disparate health outcomes among communities of color. Shifting from this context to the present, this article frames a discussion of racial health disparities through a resilience approach rather than a deficit approach and offers a blueprint for approaching the COVID-19 crisis and its afterlives through the lens of health equity.","Krishnan, Lakshmi; Ogunwole, S Michelle; Cooper, Lisa A",Ann. intern. med,,164
265694,Divisive COVID 'lab leak' debate prompts dire warnings from researchers,2021,"BACKGROUND: Front-line workers (FLW) are at risk for secondary traumatic stress, burnout, and related psychiatric sequelae: depression, anxiety, suicidality, posttraumatic stress disorder, and sleep and substance use disorders. FLW are in need of self-care programs to support their mental health. METHODS: Quasi-experimental study to assess the impact of a simple mental well-being and emotional regulation training, the Community Resiliency Model (CRM), using a convenience sample of FLW. Baseline scores of mental well-being and stress measures were compared with follow-up scores at 3 time points. Outcomes were psychological wellness (World Health Organization-5 Well-being Index); resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10); traumatic stress (Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale); physical symptoms (Somatic Symptom Scale-8). RESULTS: Of the 104 participants who enrolled and attended the CRM training, 73 (70.2%) completed at least 1 posttest. Well-being scores increased at 1 year with a small-moderate effect size (Cohen d=0.32). Resilience scores increased with a small-moderate effect size by 1 year (Cohen d=0.36). Secondary traumatic stress scores declined, with the largest effect at 1 week (Cohen d=0.49). Somatic symptoms decreased at each posttest, with the largest change occurring from baseline to 1 week (d=0.39). Participants reported an awareness of body sensations helped them when overwhelmed as a means of calming themselves. CONCLUSIONS: After a 3-hour CRM training, participants reported improved mental well-being and decreased secondary traumatic stress and somatic symptoms. This simple body awareness intervention may be a good resource during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Grabbe, Linda; Higgins, Melinda K; Baird, Marianne; Pfeiffer, Katherine M",Med. care,,164

The objective of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of two Ag-RDTs. METHODS: We evaluated CerTest SARS-CoV-2 Ag One Step Card Test and Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device Ag-RDTs. We included 320 nasopharyngeal samples: 150 PCR negative samples to assess the specificity and 170 PCR positive samples to evaluate the sensitivity. We also evaluated their sensitivity according to cycle threshold (Ct) values and the time from the onset of symptoms. Tests were compared using the McNemar's test and agreement was evaluated using the kappa score (k). RESULTS: Both Ag-RDTs showed a specificity of 100 %. Overall sensitivity was 53.5 % for CerTest and 60.0 % for Panbio. For samples with Ct&#8804; 25, sensitivity was 94.0 % for CerTest and 96.4 % for Panbio (p = 0.500). Regarding samples with Ct>25, sensitivity was 14.0 % for CerTest and 24.4 % for Panbio (p = 0.004). Sensitivity for samples within the first 5 days after the onset of symptoms were 84.8 % for CerTest and 91.3 % for Panbio (p = 0.250) and notably decreased for samples taken after the fifth day. Both Ag-RDTs showed an excellent agreement between them (agreement = 96.7 %, k = 0.920). Agreement with PCR was also excellent for high viral load samples (Ct<25) for CerTest (98.0 %, k = 0.954) and Panbio (98.8 %, k = 0.973). CONCLUSIONS: CerTest SARS-CoV-2 and Panbio COVID-19 Ag showed excellent performance and agreement results for samples with high viral loads (Ct &#8804; 25) or samples taken within the first 5 days after the onset of symptoms.","Pérez-García, Felipe; Romanyk, Juan; Gómez-Herruz, Peña; Arroyo, Teresa; Pérez-Tanoira, Ramón; Linares, Manuel; Pérez Ranz, Inés; Labrador Ballestero, Andrea; Moya Gutiérrez, Helena; Ruiz-Álvarez, Mª Jesús; Cuadros-González, Juan",J Clin Virol,,164

275253,The poisonous history of chemotherapy,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Injury to major white matter pathways during language-area associated glioma surgery often leads to permanent loss of neurological function. The aim was to establish standardized tractography of language pathways as a predictor of language outcome in clinical neurosurgery. METHODS: We prospectively analyzed 50 surgical cases of patients with left perisylvian, diffuse gliomas. Standardized preoperative Diffusion-Tensor-Imaging (DTI)-based tractography of the 5 main language tracts (Arcuate Fasciculus [AF], Frontal Aslant Tract [FAT], Inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus [IFOF], Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus [ILF], Uncinate Fasciculus [UF]) and spatial analysis of tumor and tracts was performed. Postoperative imaging and the resulting resection map were analyzed for potential surgical injury of tracts. The language status was assessed preoperatively, postoperatively and after 3 months using the Aachen Aphasia Test and Berlin Aphasia Score. Correlation analyses, two-step cluster analysis and binary logistic regression were used to analyze associations of tractography results with language outcome after surgery. RESULTS: In 14 out of 50 patients (28%), new aphasic symptoms were detected 3 months after surgery. The preoperative infiltration of the AF was associated with functional worsening (cc = 0.314; p = 0.019). Cluster analysis of tract injury profiles revealed two areas particularly related to aphasia: the temporo-parieto-occipital junction (TPO; temporo-parietal AF, middle IFOF, middle ILF) and the temporal stem/peri-insular white matter (middle IFOF, anterior ILF, temporal UF, temporal AF). Injury to these areas (TPO: OR: 23.04; CI: 4.11 - 129.06; temporal stem: OR: 21.96; CI: 2.93 - 164.41) was associated with a higher-risk of persisting aphasia. CONCLUSIONS: Tractography of language pathways can help to determine the individual aphasia risk profile pre-surgically. The TPO and temporal stem/peri-insular white matter were confirmed as functional nodes particularly sensitive to surgical injuries.","Tuncer, Mehmet Salih; Salvati, Luca Francesco; Grittner, Ulrike; Hardt, Juliane; Schilling, Ralph; Bährend, Ina; Silva, Luca Leandro; Fekonja, Lucius S; Faust, Katharina; Vajkoczy, Peter; Rosenstock, Tizian; Picht, Thomas",Neuroimage Clin,,164
275272,Nanomaterials Based Sensors for Respiratory Viral Detection: A Review,2021,"This study aimed to determine if sampling of oropharyngeal secretions (OSs) helps improves detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by nucleic acid amplification testing of potential patients with COVID-19. The first prospective study consisted of 75 patients with COVID-19 who were ready for discharge and who had 2 consecutive negative results per nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) of viral samples retrieved with nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs). Because of detection of potential false negatives in that cohort, the NAAT results of paired OS and NPS samples from 50 additional recruits with COVID-19 during their recovery stage were used in a second prospective study to compare the diagnostic values of the 2 viral RNA sampling methods. For identification of the frequency of inconsistency between the sampling methods, the McNemar's test was used for difference analysis and the kappa statistic for consistency analysis. OSs obtained from 2 of the 75 participants in the first study yielded positive results for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Both were male and aged >60 y. Subsequent chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassays indicated that they were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies. For parallel NAAT of OS and NPS samples in the second study, McNemar's test indicated that the difference between the frequencies of inconsistent parts of OS and NPS was statistically significant (P = 0.021). Cohen's kappa coefficient for OS and NPS was 0.244, which is indicative of fair consistency. The NPS test has a risk of sending home more patients (59%) who still have the infection, while the OS test will make such an error in fewer patients (14%). Although OS sampling improves the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing, it has to be emphasized that this conclusion is based on a very small sample size. Detection of viral RNA from a patient's secretions is not confirmative of viral infectivity.","Yu, C; Li, L; Tuersun, Y; Zhao, X; Feng, Q; Zhang, T; Tay, F R; Ma, J",J Dent Res,,164

However, the randomicity of these photon streams emitted from the QD seriously compromises its use and especially hinders the on-demand manipulation of the spin states. Here, by accurately integrating a QD and its mirror image onto the two foci of a bifocal metalens, we demonstrate the on-demand generation and separation of the spin states of the emitted single photons. The photon streams with different spin states emitted from the QD can be flexibly manipulated to propagate along arbitrarily designed directions with high collimation of the smallest measured beaming divergence angle of 3.17°. Our work presents an effectively integrated quantum method for the simultaneously on-demand manipulation of the polarization, propagation, and collimation of the emitted photon streams.","Bao, Yanjun; Lin, Qiaoling; Su, Rongbin; Zhou, Zhang-Kai; Song, Jindong; Li, Juntao; Wang, Xue-Hua",Sci Adv,,164

However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the level of peoples' willingness to use this kind of tele-health services. To address this gap and inform policymakers, the present study aims at accessing the Mozambican people's willingness to use tele-consultation public health services and the determinants associate to their willingness. METHODS: A total of 403 adults participated in the study. The material consisted of 32 vignettes (scenarios) describing realistic health problem situations in which an individual was proposed to use a tele-consultation public health service, varying as a function of five factors: consultation category, health problem category, health problem severity, physician category, and the consultation price. For each health problem situation presented in the vignettes, the participants were asked to rate their willingness to use the proposed tele-consultation service on an 11-point scale. A cluster analysis using the K-means procedure was applied to the quantitative raw data to capture the participants' different perspectives. ANOVA, x2 and t-test analyses were also conducted to examine the effects of the different health problem situations and the sociodemographic characteristics on the participant ratings. RESULTS: Five different perspectives (clusters) were found: never-willing (15% of the sample), severity (26%), consultation-category (22%), undecided (16%), and price-severity (21%). These perspectives were associated with participants' sociodemographic characteristics. CONCLUSION: According to the main results, it seems that the majority of the participants (69%) were highly willing to use tele-consultation public health services in the case of mild illness, cheaper prices and follow-up consultation. In addition, the participants' willingness was significantly affected by some of the participants' sociodemographic characteristics.","Vera Cruz, Germano; Dlamini, Priscilla S",BMC Public Health,,164

We explored the risk of household transmission according to: age of case and contact, sex, region, deprivation, month and household composition between April and September 2020, building a multivariate model. RESULTS: In the period studied, on average, 5.5% of household contacts in England were diagnosed as cases. Household transmission was most common between adult cases and contacts of a similar age. There was some evidence of lower transmission rates to under-16s [adjusted odds ratios (aOR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66-0.74). There were clear regional differences, with higher rates of household transmission in the north of England and the Midlands. Less deprived areas had a lower risk of household transmission. After controlling for region, there was no effect of deprivation, but houses of multiple occupancy had lower rates of household transmission [aOR 0.74 (0.66-0.83)]. CONCLUSIONS: Children are less likely to acquire SARS-CoV-2 via household transmission, and consequently there was no difference in the risk of transmission in households with children. Households in which cases could isolate effectively, such as houses of multiple occupancy, had lower rates of household transmission. Policies to support the effective isolation of cases from their household contacts could lower the level of household transmission.","Hall, J A; Harris, R J; Zaidi, A; Woodhall, S C; Dabrera, G; Dunbar, J K",Int J Epidemiol,,164
286324,Pandemic whistle-blower: we need a non-political way to track viruses,2021,"Introduction: In addition to the effects of coronavirus infection, the Covid-19 pandemic has induced widespread psychosocial distress, which has triggered the onset of anxious and depressive states, reactive to the socio-relational and economic situation induced by the pandemic. Some of our participants showed depressive and anxious attitudes even in the absence of real pictures of depression and anxiety. This phenomenon, combined with mechanisms of emulation and conditioning, can trigger a vicious cycle within interpersonal relationships and promote the administration of unnecessary treatments. Various approaches have been proposed to help populations suffering from psychosocial problems induced by the Covid-19 pandemic, but there is an objective difficulty in treating a large population. Methods: To contain and reduce this widespread psychosocial unease, in this study we used two radio electric asymmetric conveyer (REAC) technology neuromodulation treatments, neuro postural optimization (NPO) and neuropsychophysical optimization-cervicobrachial (NPPO-CB), aimed at optimizing an individual's response to the effects of environmental stressors. These treatments are quick and easy to administer; therefore, they can be administered to a large cohort of participants in a short time. To evaluate the effects of the REAC NPO and NPPO-CB treatments, the DASS-21 psychometric test was used because it has already been used to test depression, anxiety, and stress during the Covid-19 pandemic. Results: The results of the study confirm the usefulness of REAC NPO and NPPO-CB treatments in helping participants to have better coping strategies for the environmental pressures and reduce the neuropsychological and behavioral effects induced by the Covid-19 pandemic. Discussion: The results obtained in this study are consistent with previous clinical studies confirming the usefulness of the treatments to face neuropsychological and behavioral effects induced by exposome pressure.","Pinheiro Barcessat, Ana Rita; Nolli Bittencourt, Marina; Duarte Ferreira, Larissa; de Souza Neri, Erick; Coelho Pereira, José Alfredo; Bechelli, Fabio; Rinaldi, Arianna",Psychol Res Behav Manag,,164

287733,Selfie Periocular Verification using an Efficient Super-Resolution Approach,2021-02-16,"BACKGROUND: Anticipated success rates and timelines for COVID-19 vaccine development vary. Recent experience with developing and testing viral vaccine candidates can inform expectations regarding the development of safe and effective vaccines. OBJECTIVE: To estimate timelines and probabilities of success for recent vaccine candidates. DESIGN: ClinicalTrials.gov was searched to identify trials testing viral vaccines that had not advanced to phase 2 before 2005, and the progress of each vaccine from phase 1 through to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure was tracked. Trial characteristics were double-coded. (Registration: Open Science Framework [https://osf.io/dmuzx/]). SETTING: Trials launched between January 2005 and March 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Preventive viral vaccine candidates for 23 emerging or reemerged viral infectious diseases. MEASUREMENTS: The primary end point was the probability of vaccines advancing from launch of phase 2 to FDA licensure within 10 years. RESULTS: In total, 606 clinical trials forming 220 distinct development trajectories (267 343 enrolled participants) were identified. The probability of vaccines progressing from phase 2 to licensure within 10 years was 10.0% (95% CI, 2.6% to 16.9%), with most approvals representing H1N1 or H5N1 vaccines. The average timeline from phase 2 to approval was 4.4 years (range, 6.4 weeks to 13.9 years). The probabilities of advancing from phase 1 to 2, phase 2 to 3, and phase 3 to licensure within the total available follow-up time were 38.2% (CI, 30.7% to 45.0%), 38.3% (CI, 23.1% to 50.5%), and 61.1% (CI, 3.7% to 84.3%), respectively. LIMITATIONS: The study did not account for preclinical development and relied primarily on ClinicalTrials.gov and FDA resources. Success probabilities do not capture the varied reasons why vaccines fail to advance to regulatory approval. CONCLUSION: Success probabilities and timelines varied widely across different vaccine types and diseases. If a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is licensed within 18 months of the start of the pandemic, it will mark an unprecedented achievement for noninfluenza viral vaccine development.

288681,Letters,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains to be a threat across the globe. SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host is mediated by binding of viral spike protein to the Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. ACE2 is an essential member of the Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) involved in maintaining the blood pressure and vascular remodelling. Although ACE2 receptor is the entry point to the host, recent studies show activation of ACE2 to modulate the host to develop a suitable environment for its replication. However, the ACE2 activating the immune signals on SARS-CoV-2 attachment is still under investigation. We have used systems biological approach to construct the host regulatory network upon SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the ACE2 receptor. Since lungs are the primary infection site, we integrate human lung gene expression profile along with the host regulatory network to demonstrate the altered host signalling mechanism in viral infection. Further, the network was functionally enriched to determine immune modulation in the network. We also used the proteomic database to assess the occurrence of similar signalling events in other human tissues that exhibit lineage of infection across different organs. The constructed network contains 133 host proteins with 298 interactions that directly or indirectly connect to the ACE2 receptor. Among 133 proteins, 29 were found to be differentially regulated in the host lungs on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Altered proteins connect multiple proteins in a network that modulates kinase, carboxypeptidase and cytokine activity, leading to changes in the host immune system, cell cycle and signal transduction mechanisms. Further investigation showed the presence of similar signalling events in the kidneys, placenta, pancreas, testis, small intestine and adrenal gland as well. Overall, our results will help in understanding the immune molecular regulatory networks influenced by the ACE2 mediated interaction in other body tissues, which may aid in identifying the secondary health complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lite, Christy; Ahmed, Shiek S S J; Juliet, Melita; Freddy, A J",Pathog.

293395,Finding a new balance,2020,"BACKGROUND: Existing estimates of the impact of the COVID-19 burden on mental wellbeing come from countries with high mortality rates. This study therefore aimed to investigate the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown (March-April 2020) on risk for stress/depression and functional impairment in a representative sample of adult individuals in Denmark, which had lower infection rates, and whether the impact of lockdown was heterogeneous across living situation. METHODS: Using a representative, randomly drawn sample from the complete Danish adult population interviewed in March 2 to April 13, 2020 (n = 2836) and again in July 2020 (n = 1526, 54% retention rate), we study how the imposed lockdown announced March 11 following the onset of the first Danish wave of COVID-19 infections affected mental wellbeing. We use the World Health Organization Five Well-being Index (WHO-5) and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) to capture risk for stress/depression (WHO-5 < 50) and functional impairment (WSAS > 10). Using covariate adjusted ordinary least squares linear probability models and exploiting variation in the timing of responses occurring just before and just after the introduction of lockdown, we compare respondents before lockdown to respondents that answered during lockdown, as well as to answers in re-interviews in July. RESULTS: In our fully controlled models, we find reduced depressive symptoms among adults immediately after the shutdown, concentrated in adults with children living at home (-.089, p < .01 (from pre lockdown baseline .273)). Measures of functional impairment also declined immediately after the March shutdown among adults with children living at home (-.066, p < .05 (from pre lockdown baseline .150)). Impairment intensified for the entire sample between March and July (+.199, p < .001 (from pre lockdown baseline .248)), but depressive symptoms remained at lower rate in July (-.033, p < .05 (from pre lockdown baseline .332). CONCLUSIONS: Findings in Denmark indicate that living with children at home may have, in the short term, buffered the potential mental health sequelae of the COVID-19 shutdown.","Andersen, Lars H; Fallesen, Peter; Bruckner, Tim A",BMC Public Health,,164

However, the direct relationship of the increase in the severe COVID-19 risk factors, with an increase in body mass index (BMI), has not yet been evaluated. AIM: This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the dose-response relationship between body mass index (BMI) and poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Europe PMC, ProQuest, and the Cochrane Central Database. The primary outcome was composite poor outcome composed of mortality and severity. The secondary outcomes were mortality and severity. RESULTS: A total of 34,390 patients from 12 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis demonstrated that obesity was associated with composite poor outcome (OR 1.73 [1.40, 2.14], P<0.001; I2: 55.6%), mortality (OR 1.55 [1.16, 2.06], P=0.003; I2: 74.4%), and severity (OR 1.90 [1.45, 2.48], P<0.001; I2: 5.2%) in patients with COVID-19. A pooled analysis of highest BMI versus reference BMI indicate that a higher BMI in the patients was associated with composite poor outcome (aOR 3.02 [1.82, 5.00], P<0.001; I2: 59.8%), mortality (aOR 2.85 [1.17, 6.92], P=0.002; I2: 79.7%), and severity (aOR 3.08 [1.78, 5.33], P<0.001; I2: 11.7%). The dose-response meta-analysis showed an increased risk of composite poor outcome by aOR of 1.052 [1.028, 1.077], P<0.001 for every 5kg/m2 increase in BMI (Pnon-linearity<0.001). The curve became steeper with increasing BMI. CONCLUSION: Dose-response meta-analysis demonstrated that increased BMI was associated with increased poor outcome in patients with COVID-19.","Pranata, R; Lim, M A; Yonas, E; Vania, R; Lukito, A A; Siswanto, B B; Meyer, M",Diabetes metab,,164

With several reports of long-term sequelae in patients recovered from COVID-19 infection, this survey was conducted to collect the opinions of anesthesiologists regarding modifications to pre-anesthesia checkup (PAC) when COVID-19 survivors are posted for elective surgeries. We designed, validated and distributed a detailed online questionnaire, about various modifications in PAC in different patient populations like asymptomatic patients, patients with mild, moderate or severe hypoxia, significant cardiac complaints during COVID-19 and also geriatric, pediatric and pregnant patients with a history of COVID-19. We received 154 responses. Majority of responders agree that 0-2 weeks from the date of negative for SARS-CoV-2, is the ideal duration for all elective surgeries. Greater than 50% responders agree that a fresh PAC evaluation should be done for such patients which should include documentation of current functional status, fresh chest X-ray, electrocardiogram and coagulation profile. All patients who had hypoxia or cardiac symptoms during COVID-19 infection and even recovered asymptomatic geriatric patients should undergo cardiorespiratory evaluation with investigations such as HRCT chest, ABG, PFT, echocardiography and troponin I levels. Patients' PAC should be individualized, factoring in the severity of COVID-19 infection, post recovery functional status, associated co-morbidities and the urgency as well as the risk of surgical intervention.

298811,Is this the wake up call we've needed?,2020,"BACKGROUND: In 2019, there were 70.8 million forcibly displaced people worldwide. Among the top causes of morbidity and mortality were measles, diarrhea, respiratory illness, and malaria. Availability of accurate diagnostics that are of low complexity, affordable, and produce timely results on site without the need for expensive laboratory equipment, extensive training, or distant transport of samples, are essential tools in the response to humanitarian emergencies (HE). Early detection of infectious diseases with epidemic potential and coordinated outbreak response, can result in significant decrease in morbidity and mortality. CONTENT: This review explores the utility of point of care and rapid diagnostic tests (POCT/RDTs) in HE and presents a review and analysis of the low complexity, availability, and ease of use of these diagnostic modalities that make them helpful tools in these settings, despite the generally lower test performance metrics associated with them over conventional laboratory-based assays. We review the literature to understand how POCT/RDTs have been used in HE response to produce lifesaving information without the need for a robust system for transporting test samples to more sophisticated laboratories, as this is often prohibitive in areas affected by conflict or natural disasters. SUMMARY: We propose that POCT/RDTs be considered essential healthcare tools provided to countries following a HE and suggest that UN agencies and vulnerable countries include effective RDTs in their essential diagnostics as part of their national preparedness and response plans.","Chadwick, Stephen; Townes, David A; Perrone, Lucy A",,,164

In the light of these challenges, this study proposes an interpretable self-supervised multi-task learning model to jointly and effectively tackle the tasks of information retrieval (IR) and extraction (IE) during the current emergency health crisis situation. Our results show that our model effectively leverage the multi-task and self-supervised learning to improve generalization, data efficiency and robustness to the ongoing dataset shift problem. Our model outperforms baselines in IE and IR tasks, respectively by micro-f score of 0.08 (LCA-F score of 0.05), and MAP of 0.05 on average.

301371,The bad environmentalism of ‘nature is healing’ memes,2021,"COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest communicable disease outbreak to have hit Malaysia since the 1918 Spanish Flu which killed 34,644 people or 1% of the population of the then British Malaya. In 1999, the Nipah virus outbreak killed 105 Malaysians, while the SARS outbreak of 2003 claimed only 2 lives. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has so far claimed over 100 Malaysian lives. There were two waves of the COVID-19 cases in Malaysia. First wave of 22 cases occurred from January 25 to February 15 with no death and full recovery of all cases. The ongoing second wave, which commenced on February 27, presented cases in several clusters, the biggest of which was the Sri Petaling Tabligh cluster with an infection rate of 6.5%, and making up 47% of all cases in Malaysia. Subsequently, other clusters appeared from local mass gatherings and imported cases of Malaysians returning from overseas. Healthcare workers carry high risks of infection due to the daily exposure and management of COVID-19 in the hospitals. However, 70% of them were infected through community transmission and not while handling patients. In vulnerable groups, the incidence of COVID-19 cases was highest among the age group 55 to 64 years. In terms of fatalities, 63% were reported to be aged above 60 years, and 81% had chronic comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart diseases. The predominant COVID-19 strain in Malaysia is strain B, which is found exclusively in East Asia. However, strain A, which is mostly found in the USA and Australia, and strain C in Europe were also present. To contain the epidemic, Malaysia implemented a Movement Control Order (MCO) beginning on March 18 in 4 phases over 2 months, ending on May 12. In terms of economic impacts, Malaysia lost RM2.4 billion a day during the MCO period, with an accumulated loss of RM63 billion up to the end of April. Since May 4, Malaysia has relaxed the MCO and opened up its economic sector to relieve its economic burden. Currently, the best approach to achieving herd immunity to COVID-19 is through vaccination rather than by acquiring it naturally. There are at least two candidate vaccines which have reached the final stage of human clinical trials. Malaysia's COVID-19 case fatality rate is lower than what it is globally; this is due to the successful implementation of early preparedness and planning, the public health and hospital system, comprehensive contact tracing, active case detection, and a strict enhanced MCO.","Hashim, Jamal Hisham; Adman, Mohammad Adam; Hashim, Zailina; Mohd Radi, Mohd Firdaus; Kwan, Soo Chen",Front Public Health,,164

301816,How Europe's 100-billion science fund will shape 7 years of research,2021,"The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to worldwide human infections and deaths. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of coronaviruses (CoVs) is a multifunctional RNA binding protein necessary for viral RNA replication and transcription. Therefore, it is a potential antiviral drug target, serving multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle. This study addresses the potential to repurpose antiviral compounds approved or in development for treating human CoV induced infections against SARS-CoV-2 N. For this purpose, we used the docking methodology to better understand the inhibitory mechanism of this protein with the existing 34 antiviral compounds. The results of this analysis indicate that rapamycin, saracatinib, camostat, trametinib, and nafamostat were the top hit compounds with binding energy (-11.87, -10.40, -9.85, -9.45, -9.35 kcal/mol, respectively). This analysis also showed that the most common residues that interact with the compounds are Phe66, Arg68, Gly69, Tyr123, Ile131, Trp132, Val133, and Ala134. Subsequently, protein-ligand complex stability was examined with molecular dynamics simulations for these five compounds, which showed the best binding affinity. According to the results of this study, the interaction between these compounds and crucial residues of the target protein were maintained. These results suggest that these residues are potential drug targeting sites for the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. This study information will contribute to the development of novel compounds for further in vitro and in vivo studies of SARS-CoV-2, as well as possible new drug repurposing strategies to treat COVID-19 disease.","Tatar, Gizem; Ozyurt, Ezgi; Turhan, Kemal",Biotechnol Prog,,164

303039,Role of intelligent computing in COVID-19 prognosis: A state-of-the-art review,2020,"Despite rapidly evolving knowledge about COVID 19 infection, routes of perinatal COVID 19 transmission and viral load in mother neonate dyad remain uncertain. Data were analysed to describe the clinicodemographic profile and viral load in neonates born to COVID 19 positive mothers. Of 2947 deliveries, 69 mothers were COVID 19 positive (2.3%), with 1 abortion, 2 macerated stillbirths and 2 fresh stillbirths as pregnancy outcomes. Of 65 tested neonates, 10.7% (7) were confirmed COVID 19 positive by RTPCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction). Viral load (cycle threshold, Ct of E, RDRp) in neonates was comparable with the Ct reported from adults; however, neonates had milder clinical manifestations. All 7 neonates who tested positive for COVID 19 were subsequently discharged. Six of the 7 neonates were asymptomatic and 1 neonate needed respiratory support (indication being prematurity) which resolved after 48 h. Maternal and neonatal comparison of Ct of E and RdRp gene was statistically non-significant (25.97 vs 19.68, p = 0.34 and 26.5 vs 25.0, p = 0.84). Viral loads of mothers with COVID 19 positive neonates compared with mothers with COVID 19 negative neonates for E and RdRp gene were also statistically non-significant (25 vs 27.19, p = 0.63 and 19.6 vs 27.6, p = 0.08). The majority (93%) of neonates tested later than 48 h (roomed in with mother and breastfed) tested negative.Conclusion: The study supports milder manifestation in COVID 19 positive neonates. Risk of transmission from COVID 19 positive mother to neonate by rooming-in and breastfeeding is low. In this study on a limited number of neonates, maternal viral load was not found to be associated with the positivity status or severity of the illness of neonate. What is Known: â¢ Neonates born to COVID 19 positive mothers are at risk of COVID 19 infection. What is New: â¢ Risk of transmission of COVID 19 from mother to neonate, with rooming-in and breastfeeding, appears low. â¢ In this study on a limited number of neonates, maternal viral load of COVID 19 (E and RdRp cycle thresholds) was not associated with severity of illness or COVID 19 positivity in neonates.","Anand, Pratima; Yadav, Anita; Debata, Pradeep; Bachani, Sumitra; Gupta, Nitesh; Gera, Rani",Eur. j. pediatr,,164
303849,Revisiting SVD to generate powerful Node Embeddings for Recommendation Systems,2021-10-05,"Summary Background Research in genetics and infectious diseases (ID) presents novel configurations of ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSIs) related to the intersection of genetics with public health regulations and the control of transmissible diseases. Such research includes work both in pathogen genetics and on the ways that human genetics affect responses to ID. This paper identifies and systematizes the unique issues at this intersection, based on an interdisciplinary expert review. Methodology This paper presents results of a formal issue-spotting exercise among twenty experts in public health, law and genomics, biobanking, genetic epidemiology, ID medicine and public health, philosophy, ethics and ID, ethics and genomics, and law and ID. The focus of the exercise was on the collection, storage, and sharing of genetic information relating to ID. Results The issue-spotting exercise highlighted the following ELSIs: risks in reporting to government authorities, return of individual research results, and resource allocation – each taking on specific configurations based on the balance between public health and individual privacy/protection. Conclusions The public health implications of interactions between genomics and ID frame considerations for equity and justice. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, these issues are especially pressing.","Walker, Alexis Bonham Vence L.; Boyce, Angie Clayton Ellen Wright Garcia Debra Johnson Stephanie Laeyendecker Oliver Lewis Michelle Margolick Joseph B.; Mathews, Debra Parker Michael J.; Spicer, Paul Thio Chloe L.; Geller, Gail Kahn Jeffrey","Ethics, Medicine and Public Health",,164
304346,Constructing alternating 2-cocycles on Fourier algebras,2020-08-05,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID19 evolved rapidly into a global pandemic, forcing hospitals, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) referral units, to change their practices to ensure quality of care. AIMS: To describe the clinical outcomes and the fulfilment of the treatment schedule of patients with IBD treated with biological agents in a single-center of a red-zone of the pandemic, and to report the patients' perceptions about COVID-19 and the measures adopted at our center. METHODS: Therapeutic adherence and clinical outcomes were collected for all patients undergoing treatment with intravenous biologicals and subcutaneous biologicals at our center. A telephone survey was also performed to assess these patients' perceptions of the COVID pandemic and the related measures adopted at their IBD unit. RESULTS: A total of 234 patients were included (117 on intravenous and 117 on subcutaneous biologicals). Only 10% of patients postponed intravenous infusions intentionally and 5% postponed the collection of subcutaneous biologicals at the hospital pharmacy. Only five confirmed COVID-19 cases were registered (2.1%), all of them of mild severity. One hundred and fifty-five patients participated in the survey (77 on intravenous and 78 on subcutaneous drugs). Fear of going to the hospital was the most common reason for postponing biological administrations. Among those on combination therapy, only 7% admitted to have withdrawn immunosuppressants. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to intravenous and subcutaneous biological therapies during the pandemic was high in a single-center cohort of IBD patients even though the cumulative incidence of confirmed COVID-19 was low.","Iborra, Ignacio; Puig, Maria; Marín, Laura; Calafat, Margalida; Cañete, Fiorella; Quiñones, Carles; González-González, Laura; Cardona, Glòria; Mañosa, Míriam; Domènech, Eugeni",Dig. dis. sci,,164
304470,Zeit für einen Rückblick auf ein ganz besonderes Jahr und einen Blick nach vorne,2020,"Recently, there have been many global outbreaks of diseases. The latest is the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The virus has spread worldwide and is transmitted mainly through droplets or by touching contaminated surfaces. Globally, health-care systems are challenged due to a lack of workplace safety and professional obligations in addition to the rapid spread of the virus. Dental facilities are at greater risk due to the nature of dental care. The aim of this review study was to provide a situational analysis within dental facilities during the new COVID-19 outbreak. Published papers concerning dental facilities and COVID-19 were retrieved from PubMed, search engines, and organizational websites. All data were reviewed, arranged into themes, and then categorized either as strengths or weaknesses with respect to addressing the COVID-19 pandemic in dental facilities, and accordingly, threats and possible opportunities to the handling of the pandemic were identified. Preparedness of dental facilities during the current pandemic is a weakness that needs to be addressed promptly. Shortage of dental care providers, cyber security, economic losses, and ethical challenges are possible threats due to the current outbreak. Coordination and prompt communication among all healthcare providers during such outbreaks is a strength that needs to be supported. This strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis can be a useful tool for guiding decision-making as it is crucial during the current pandemic to work on weaknesses, avoid threats, and utilize all future opportunities.","Gaffar, Balgis; Alhumaid, Jehan; Alhareky, Muhanad; Alonaizan, Faisal; Almas, Khalid",Risk Manage.

Purpose: This study evaluated the effect of COVID-19 on neonatal outcomes and the scope of vertical transmission. Methods: This ambispective observational study enrolled pregnant women with COVID-19 in North India from April 1 to August 31, 2020 to evaluate neonatal outcomes and the risk of vertical transmission. Results: A total of 44 neonates born to 41 COVID-19-positive mothers were evaluated. Among them, 28 (68.3%) patients (two sets of twins) were delivered within 7 days of testing positive for COVID-19, 23 (56%) patients (two sets of twins) were delivered by cesarean section; 13 (29.5%) newborns hada low birth weight; seven (15.9%) were preterm; and six (13.6%) required neonatal intensive care unit admission, reflecting an increased incidence of cesarean delivery and low birth weight but zero neonatal mortality. Samples of cord blood, placental membrane, vaginal fluid, amniotic fluid, peritoneal fluid (in case of cesarean section), and breast milk for COVID-19 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tested negative in 22 prospective delivery cases. Nasopharyngeal swabs of two newborns tested positive for COVID-19: one at 24 hours and the other on day 4 of life. In the former case, biological samples were not collected as the mother was asymptomatic and her COVID-19 report was available post-delivery; hence, the source of infection remained inconclusive. In the latter case, all samples tested negative, ruling out the possibility of vertical transmission. All neonates remained asymptomatic on follow-up. Conclusion: COVID-19 does not have direct adverse effects on the fetus per se. The possibility of vertical transmission is almost negligible, although results from larger trials are required to confirm our findings.","Sharma, Ritu; Seth, Shikha; Sharma, Rakhee; Yadav, Sanju; Mishra, Pinky; Mukhopadhyay, Sujaya",,,164
305591,A Comprehensive Survey on Word Representation Models: From Classical to State-Of-The-Art Word Representation Language Models,2020-10-28,"Here, we advocate a highly favourable opportunity for the treatment of COVID-19 disease by repurposing a long-serving medical agent with an excellent history of clinical use, namely heparin. Heparin is best known as an anticoagulant, but it also exhibits direct antiviral activity against many enveloped viruses and has anti-inflammatory activity. The high incidence of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients suggests that coagulopathy plays an important role in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. This already makes heparin a unique, potentially curative agent that can be used immediately to help resolve the ongoing crisis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. We demonstrate here in vitro that heparin does indeed inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. The three concurrent modes of activity of heparin (antiviral, anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory) against SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 form a unique therapeutic combination. Thus, repurposing of heparin to fight SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 appears to be a powerful, readily available measure to address the current pandemic.","Conzelmann, Carina; Müller, Janis A; Perkhofer, Lukas; Sparrer, Konstantin Mj; Zelikin, Alexander N; Münch, Jan; Kleger, Alexander",Clin Med (Lond),,164

Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the reproductive numbers (R) for each epidemic stage to analyze the effects of the preventive measures and to predict the COVID-19 transmission trends. METHODS: We estimated the transmission rates for each epidemic stage by fitting a COVID-19 transmission model, based on a deterministic mathematical model, to the data on confirmed cases. The effects of preventive measures such as social distancing by time period were analyzed, and the size and trends of future COVID-19 outbreaks were estimated. RESULTS: The value of R was 3.53 from February18, 2020 to February 28, 2020, and the mean R reduced to 0.45 from March 14, 2020 to April 29, 2020, but it significantly increased to 2.69 from April 30, 2020 to May13, 2020 and it was maintained at 1.03 from May 14, 2020 to July 23, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: According to the estimated R, it had fallen to below 1 and was maintained at that level owing to the isolation of infected persons by the public health authorities and social distancing measures followed by the general public. Then, the estimated R increased rapidly as the contact among individuals increased during the long holiday period from April 30, 2020 to May 5, 2020. Thereafter, the value of R dropped, with the continued use of preventive measures but remained higher than 1.00, indicating that the COVID-19 outbreak can be prolonged and develop into a severe outbreak at any time.","Choi, Sunhwa; Ki, Moran",Epidemiol Health,,164

Moreover, the impact of CP treatment on the composition of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 patients and antibody markers that differentiate between those who survive and those who succumb to the COVID-19 disease are not well understood. Herein, we performed longitudinal analysis of antibody profile on 115 sequential plasma samples from 16 hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with either CP or standard of care, only half of them survived. Differential antibody kinetics was observed for antibody binding, IgM/IgG/IgA distribution, and affinity maturation in 'survived' vs. 'fatal' COVID-19 patients. Surprisingly, CP treatment did not predict survival. Strikingly, marked decline in neutralization titers was observed in the fatal patients prior to death, and convalescent plasma treatment did not reverse this trend. Furthermore, irrespective of CP treatment, higher antibody affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion spike was associated with survival outcome, while sustained elevated IgA response was associated with fatal outcome in these COVID-19 patients. These findings propose that treatment of COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma should be carefully targeted, and effectiveness of treatment may depend on the clinical and immunological status of COVID-19 patients as well as the quality of the antibodies in the convalescent plasma.","Tang, Juanjie; Grubbs, Gabrielle; Lee, Youri; Golding, Hana; Khurana, Surender",Clin. infect. dis,,164

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using terms related to novel coronavirus 2019 and human milk, a systematic search was performed in three electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science) for studies published between December 2019 and 15 October 2020. Published peer-reviewed studies reporting the results of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human milk in mothers with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Proportion meta-analysis of case series and prospective cohort studies was performed using STATA version 14.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) and pooled estimate (with 95% confidence interval) of overall incidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission was calculated. RESULTS: We identified 936 records, of which 34 studies (24 case-reports, 10 cohort studies) were eligible for this systematic review. A total of 116 confirmed COVID-19 lactating women (88 in cohort and 28 in case-reports) underwent RT-PCR testing in human milk, and 10 (six in case reports) were detected to have SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The overall pooled proportion (from cohort studies) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in human milk was 2.16% (95% CI: 0.0-8.81%, I 2: 0%). Four studies (six patients) also reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (along with RT-PCR) in human milk. CONCLUSIONS: The limited low-quality evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected in human milk in an extremely low proportion, however, based on current evidence no conclusion can be drawn about its infectivity and impact on the infants. In concordance with World Health Organization recommendations, exclusive breastfeeding should be considered in all cases unless any other contraindication exists.","Kumar, Jogender; Meena, Jitendra; Yadav, Arushi; Kumar, Praveen",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,164

We tested whether messages designed to address these beliefs and concerns might promote intentions to get a COVID-19 vaccine. MethodAn online survey fielded between March 8-March 23, 2021 with US Veteran (n=688) and non-Veteran (n=387) respondents. In a between-subjects experiment, respondents were randomly assigned to a control group (with no message) or to read one of two intervention messages: 1. a fact-box styled message comparing the risks of getting COVID-19 compared to the vaccine, and 2. a timeline styled message describing the development process of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. ResultsMost respondents (60%) wanted a COVID-19 vaccine. However, 17% expressed hesitancy and 23% did not want to get a COVID-19 vaccine. The fact-box styled message and the timeline message did not significantly improve vaccination intentions, F(2,359)=0.91, p=.402, [Formula], or reduce the time respondents wanted to wait before getting vaccinated, F(2,307)=0.76, p=.468, [Formula], compared to no messages.

Using experimental data, a simple empirical mathematical model was introduced. Results from injection experiments were subsequently incorporated into an artificial neural network to establish a predictive framework for injectability. Last, simulations and experimental results contributed to the design of a syringe that maximizes injectability in vitro and in vivo. The custom injection system enabled a sixfold increase in injectability of large microparticles compared to a commercial syringe.

Estimating the amount of space needed to safely social distance in various retail environments,2020,"BACKGROUND: No studies have reported on how to relieve distress or relax in medical health workers while wearing medical protective equipment in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The study aimed to establish which relaxation technique, among six, is the most feasible in first-line medical health workers wearing medical protective equipment. METHODS: This was a two-step study collecting data with online surveys. Step 1: 15 first-line medical health workers were trained to use six different relaxation techniques and reported the two most feasible techniques while wearing medical protective equipment. Step 2: the most two feasible relaxation techniques revealed by step 1 were quantitatively tested in a sample of 65 medical health workers in terms of efficacy, no space limitation, no time limitation, no body position requirement, no environment limitation to be done, easiness to learn, simplicity, convenience, practicality, and acceptance. RESULTS: Kegel exercise and autogenic relaxation were the most feasible techniques according to step 1. In step 2, Kegel exercise outperformed autogenic relaxation on all the 10 dimensions among the 65 participants while wearing medical protective equipment (efficacy: 24 v. 15, no space limitation: 30 v. 4, no time limitation: 31 v. 4, no body position requirement: 26 v. 4, no environment limitation: 30 v. 11, easiness to learn: 28 v. 5, simplicity: 29 v. 7, convenience: 29 v. 4, practicality: 30 v. 14, acceptance: 32 v. 6). CONCLUSION: Kegel exercise seems a promising self-relaxation technique for first-line medical health workers while wearing medical protective equipment among COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhang, Huiqin; Li, Aimin; Zhu, Boheng; Niu, Yanyan; Ruan, Zheng; Liu, Lihong; Gao, Xiaoling; Wang, Kun; Yin, Lu; Peng, Mao; Xue, Qing; Leng, Haixia; Min, Baoquan; Tian, Qing; Wang, Chunxue; Yang, Yuan; Zhu, Zhou; Si, Tianmei; Li, Wei; Shangguan, Fangfang; Hong, Xia; Chang, Hong; Song, Haiqing; Li, Dongning; Jia, Longbin; Dong, Huiqing; Wang, Yuping; Cosci, Fiammetta; Wang, Hongxing",Psychol Med,,164

Our working hypothesis was that, even within slums, an inverse relationship existed between living density and access to shared or private WASH facilities. METHODS: In an exploratory, secondary analysis of World Bank, cross-sectional microdata from slums in Bangladesh we investigated the relationship between intra-household population density (crowding) and access to private or shared water sources and toilet facilities. RESULTS: The analysis showed that most households were single-room dwellings (80.4%). Median crowding ranged from 0.55 m2 per person up to 67.7 m2 per person. The majority of the dwellings (83.3%), shared both toilet facilities and the source of water, and there was a significant positive relationship between crowding and the use of shared facilities. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the practical constraints on implementing, in slums, the conventional COVID19 management approaches of social distancing, regular hand washing, and not sharing spaces. It has implications for the management of future respiratory epidemics.","Hasan, Shaikh Mehdi; Das, Susmita; Hanifi, Syed Manzoor Ahmed; Shafique, Sohana; Rasheed, Sabrina; Reidpath, Daniel D",BMC Public Health,,164

317176,The countries getting it right,2020,"BACKGROUND: It is now 25 years since the adoption of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and the same concerns raised during its negotiations such as high prices of medicines, market exclusivity and delayed market entry for generics remain relevant as highlighted recently by the Ebola and COVID-19 pandemics. The World Health Organization's (WHO) mandate to work on the interface between intellectual property, innovation and access to medicine has been continually reinforced and extended to include providing support to countries on the implementation of TRIPS flexibilities in collaboration with stakeholders. This study analyses the role of intellectual property on access to medicines in the African Region. METHODS: We analyze patent data from the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) and Organisation Africaine de la Propriété Intellectuelle (OAPI) to provide a situational analysis of patenting activity and trends. We also review legislation to assess how TRIPS flexibilities are implemented in countries. RESULTS: Patenting was low for African countries. Only South Africa and Cameroon appeared in the list of top ten originator countries for ARIPO and OAPI respectively. Main diseases covered by African patents were HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular diseases, cancers and tumors. Majority countries have legislation allowing for compulsory licensing and parallel importation of medicines, while the least legislated flexibilities were explicit exemption of pharmaceutical products from patentable subject matter, new or second use of patented pharmaceutical products, imposition of limits to patent term extension and test data protection. Thirty-nine countries have applied TRIPS flexibilities, with the most common being compulsory licensing and least developed country transition provisions. CONCLUSIONS: Opportunities exist for WHO to work with ARIPO and OAPI to support countries in reviewing their legislation to be more responsive to public health needs.","Motari, Marion; Nikiema, Jean-Baptiste; Kasilo, Ossy M J; Kniazkov, Stanislav; Loua, Andre; Sougou, Aissatou; Tumusiime, Prosper",BMC Public Health,,164
318235,What Has It Meant for Me to Be an Epidemiologist in 2020?,2021,"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent behind the ongoing pandemic exhibits an enhanced potential for infection when compared to its related family members- the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV; which have caused similar disease outbreaks in the past. The severity of the global health burden, increasing mortality rate and the emergent economic crisis urgently demands the development of next generation vaccines. Amongst such emergent next generation vaccines are the multi-epitope subunit vaccines, which hold promise in combating deadly pathogens. In this study we have exploited immunoinformatics applications to delineate a vaccine candidate possessing multiple B and T cells epitopes by utilizing the SARS-CoV-2 non structural and structural proteins. The antigenicity potential, safety, structural stability and the production feasibility of the designed construct was evaluated computationally. Furthermore, due to the known role of human TLR-3 immune receptor in viral sensing, which facilitates host cells activation for an immune response, the vaccine construct was examined for its binding efficiency using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies, which resulted in strong and stable interactions. Finally, the immune simulation studies suggested an effective immune response on vaccine administration. Overall, the immunoinformatics analysis advocates that the proposed vaccine candidate is safe and immunogenic and therefore can be pushed as a lead for in vitro and in vivo investigations.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

331131,Why measles deaths are surging - and coronavirus could make it worse,2020,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), average size 100 nm, can be aerosolized by cough, sneeze, speech and breath of infected persons. The airborne carrier for the COVID-19 can be tiny droplets and particulates from infected person, fine suspended mists (humidity) in air, or ambient aerosols in air. To-date, unfortunately there are no test standards for nano-aerosols (≤100 nm). A goal in our study is to develop air filters (e.g. respirator, facemask, ventilator, medical breathing filter/system) with 90% capture on 100-nm airborne COVID-19 with pressure drop of less than 30 Pa (3.1 mm water). There are two challenges. First, this airborne bio-nanoaerosol (combined virus and carrier) is amorphous unlike cubic NaCl crystals. Second, unlike standard laboratory tests on NaCl and test oil (DOP) droplets, these polydispersed aerosols all challenge the filter simultaneously and they are of different sizes and can interact among themselves complicating the filtration process. For the first time, we have studied these two effects using ambient aerosols (simulating the bio-nanoaerosols of coronavirus plus carrier of different shapes and sizes) to challenge electrostatically charged multilayer/multimodule nanofiber filters. This problem is fundamentally complicated due to mechanical and electrostatic interactions among aerosols of different sizes with induced charges of different magnitudes. The test filters were arranged in 2, 4, and 6 multiple-modules stack-up with each module having 0.765 g/m 2of charged PVDF nanofibers (mean diameter 525 ± 191 nm). This configuration minimized electrical interference among neighboring charged nanofibers and reduced flow resistance in the filter. For ambient aerosol size&gt;80 nm (applicable to the smallest COVID-19), the electrostatic effect contributes 100–180% more efficiency to the existing mechanical efficiency (due to diffusion and interception) depending on the number of modules in the filter. By stacking-up modules to increase fiber basis weight in the filter, a 6-layer charged nanofiber filter achieved 88%, 88% and 96% filtration efficiency for, respectively, 55-nm, 100-nm and 300-nm ambient aerosol. This is very close to attaining our set goal of 90%-efficiency on the 100-nm ambient aerosol. The pressure drop for the 6-layer nanofiber filter was only 26 Pa (2.65 mm water column) which was below our limit of 30 Pa (3.1 mm water). For the test multi-module filters, a high ‘quality factor’ (efficiency-to-pressure-drop ratio) of about 0.1 to 0.13 Pa −1can be consistently maintained, which was far better than conventional filters. Using the same PVDF 6-layer charged nanofiber filter, laboratory tests results using monodispersed NaCl aerosols of 50, 100, and 300 nm yielded filtration efficiency, respectively, 92%, 94% and 98% (qualified for 'N98 standard') with same pressure drop of 26 Pa. The 2–6% discrepancy in efficiency for the NaCl aerosols was primarily attributed to the absence of interaction among aerosols of different sizes using monodispersed NaCl aerosols in the laboratory. This discrepancy can be further reduced with increasing number of modules in the filter and for larger 300-nm aerosol. The 6-layer charged nanofiber filter was qualified as a 'N98 respirator' (98% capture efficiency for 300-nm NaCl aerosols) but with pressure drop of only 2.65-mm water which was 1/10 below conventional N95 with 25-mm (exhaling) to 35-mm (inhaling) water column! The 6-layer charged PVDF nanofiber filter provides good personal protection against airborne COVID-19 virus and nano-aerosols from pollution based on the N98 standard, yet it is at least 10X more breathable than a conventional N95 respirator.","Leung, Wallace Woon-Fong; Sun, Qiangqiang",Sep.

This policy received many critics, as Indonesia still experiencing a fluctuated number of infected cases. Understanding public perception through effective risk communication can assist the government in relaying an appropriate message to improve people's compliance and to avoid further disease spread. OBJECTIVE: This study observed how risk communication using social media platforms like Twitter could be adopted to measure public attention on COVID-19 related issues ""New Normal"". METHOD: From May 21 to June 18, 2020, we archived all tweets related to COVID-19 containing keywords: ""#NewNormal"", and ""New Normal"" using Drone Emprit Academy (DEA) engine. DEA search API collected all requested tweets and described the cumulative tweets for trend analysis, word segmentation, and word frequency. We further analyzed the public perception using sentiment analysis and identified the predominant tweets using emotion analysis. RESULT: We collected 284,216 tweets from 137,057 active users. From the trend analysis, we observed three stages of the changing trend of the public's attention on the ""New Normal"". Results from the sentiment analysis indicate that more than half of the population (52%) had a ""positive"" sentiment towards the ""New Normal"" issues while only 41% of them had a ""negative"" perception. Our study also demonstrated the public's sentiment trend has gradually shifted from ""negative"" to ""positive"" due to the influence of both the government actions and the spread of the disease. A more detailed analysis of the emotion analysis showed that the majority of the public emotions (77.6%) relied on the emotion of ""trust"", ""anticipation"", and ""joy"". Meanwhile, people were also surprised (8.62%) that the Indonesian government progressed to the ""New Normal"" concept despite a fluctuating number of cases. CONCLUSION: Our findings offer an opportunity for the government to use Twitter in the process of quick decision-making and policy evaluation during uncertain times in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rahmanti, Annisa Ristya; Ningrum, Dina Nur Anggraini; Lazuardi, Lutfan; Yang, Hsuan-Chia; Li, Yu-Chuan Jack",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,164

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical courses of adult patients admitted for COVID-19 and identify associations between inpatient clinical features and post-discharge need for acute care. DESIGN: Retrospective chart reviews were performed to record laboratory values, temperature, and oxygen requirements of 99 adult inpatients with COVID-19. Those variables were used to predict emergency department (ED) visit or readmission within 30 days post-discharge. PATIENTS (OR PARTICIPANTS): Age &#8805; 18 years, first hospitalization for COVID-19, admitted between March 1 and May 2, 2020, at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Medical Center, managed by an inpatient medicine service. MAIN MEASURES: Ferritin, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, procalcitonin, white blood cell count, absolute lymphocyte count, temperature, and oxygen requirement were noted. KEY RESULTS: Of 99 patients, five required ED admission within 30 days, and another five required readmission. Fever within 24 h of discharge, oxygen requirement, and laboratory abnormalities were not associated with need for ED visit or readmission within 30 days of discharge after admission for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that neither persistent fever, oxygen requirement, nor laboratory marker derangement was associated with need for acute care in the 30-day period after discharge for severe COVID-19. These findings suggest that physicians need not await the normalization of laboratory markers, resolution of fever, or discontinuation of oxygen prior to discharging a stable or improving patient with COVID-19.","Saab, Faysal G; Chiang, Jeffrey N; Brook, Rachel; Adamson, Paul C; Fulcher, Jennifer A; Halperin, Eran; Manuel, Vladimir; Goodman-Meza, David",J. gen. intern. med,,164
334242,Assessing groundwater quality for drinking water supply using hybrid fuzzy-GIS-based water quality index,2020,"The massive inflow of patients with COVID-19 requiring urgent care has overloaded hospitals in France and impacts the management of other patients. Deferring hospitalization and non-urgent surgeries has become a priority for surgeons today in order to relieve the health care system.It is obviously not simple to reduce emergency surgery without altering the quality of care or leading to a loss of chance for the patient. Acute appendicitis is a very specific situation and the prevalence of this disease leads us to reconsider this particular disease in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. Indeed, while the currently recommended treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis is surgical appendectomy, the non-surgical alternative of medical management by antibiotic therapy alone has been widely evaluated by high-quality studies in the literature. Insofar as the main limitation of exclusively medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis is the risk of recurrent appendicitis, this treatment option represents an alternative of choice to reduce the intra-hospital overload in this context of health crisis.The aim of this work is therefore to provide physicians and surgeons with a practical guide based on a review of the literature on the medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults, to offer this alternative treatment to the right patients and under good conditions, especially when access to the operating room is limited or impossible.","Collard, Maxime; Lefevre, Jérémie H; Maggiori, Léon",,,164

However, natural language text is high-dimensional and sparse, and the same rumor may be expressed in hundreds of ways on social media. As such, the robustness and generalization of the current rumor detection model are put into question. We propose a new hierarchical model called HAT-RD, which is divided into two categories: post-level modules and event-level modules. HAT-RD adopts a novel hierarchical adversarial training method based on gradient ascent by adding adversarial perturbations to the embedding layers both of post-level modules and event-level modules to deceive the detector. At the same time, the detector uses stochastic gradient descent to minimize the adversarial risk to learn a more robust model. In this way, the post-level and event-level sample spaces are enhanced, and experiments indicate that the model drift into an area with a flat loss landscape that leads to better generalization. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods.","Ni, Shiwen; Li, Jiawen; Kao, Hung-Yu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00425v1.pdf,164

335658,Trump lied about science,2020,"Community and close contact exposures continue to drive the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CDC and other public health authorities recommend community mitigation strategies to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1,2). Characterization of community exposures can be difficult to assess when widespread transmission is occurring, especially from asymptomatic persons within inherently interconnected communities. Potential exposures, such as close contact with a person with confirmed COVID-19, have primarily been assessed among COVID-19 cases, without a non-COVID-19 comparison group (3,4). To assess community and close contact exposures associated with COVID-19, exposures reported by case-patients (154) were compared with exposures reported by control-participants (160). Case-patients were symptomatic adults (persons aged &#8805;18 years) with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Control-participants were symptomatic outpatient adults from the same health care facilities who had negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. Close contact with a person with known COVID-19 was more commonly reported among case-patients (42%) than among control-participants (14%). Case-patients were more likely to have reported dining at a restaurant (any area designated by the restaurant, including indoor, patio, and outdoor seating) in the 2 weeks preceding illness onset than were control-participants (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5-3.8). Restricting the analysis to participants without known close contact with a person with confirmed COVID-19, case-patients were more likely to report dining at a restaurant (aOR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.9-4.3) or going to a bar/coffee shop (aOR = 3.9, 95% CI = 1.5-10.1) than were control-participants. Exposures and activities where mask use and social distancing are difficult to maintain, including going to places that offer on-site eating or drinking, might be important risk factors for acquiring COVID-19.

337224,What Has It Meant for Me to Be an Epidemiologist in 2020,2021,"BackgroundThe second COVID-19 wave in India, triggered by the Delta variant,has been associated with an unprecedented increase in cases of COVID-19 associated Mucormycosis(CAM), mainly Rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis(ROCM).The primary reason appears to be an unusual alignment of multiple risk factors in patients like prevalence of hypoxia, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, indiscriminate use of steroids, high iron levels and immune dysfunction. MethodsThis retrospective cohort study was conducted at Noble hospital and Research Centre (NHRC), Pune, Western India between 1st April 2020 and 1st August 2021 to identify patients admitted with CAM. The primary endpoint was incidence of all cause mortality due to CAM. Secondary outcomes studied were need for mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit(ICU) admission. Baseline and time dependent risk factors significantly associated with death due to CAM were identified by Relative risk estimation. Results59 patients were diagnosed with Mucormycosis at NHRC (58 ROCM, 1 Renal (disseminated) mucormycosis). Median age of the cohort was 52(IQR: 41,61) years and it included 20.3% females. Median duration from first positive COVID-19 RT PCR test to diagnosis of Mucormycosis was 17(IQR: 12,22) days. 90% patients were diabetic with 30% being newly diagnosed at the time of COVID-19 admission and 89% having uncontrolled sugar level (HbA1c > 7%). All patients were prescribed steroids during treatment for COVID-19. 56% patients were prescribed steroids for non-hypoxemic, mild COVID (irrational steroid therapy) while in 9%, steroids were indicated but were prescribed in inappropriately high dose. Majority of the patients were treated with a combination of surgical debridement(94%), intravenous Amphotericin B(91%) and concomitant oral Posoconazole therapy(95.4%). 74.6% patients were discharged after clinical and radiologic recovery while 25.4% (15 patients) died. On Relative risk analysis, CT severity score during COVID-19 admission [≥]18 (p=0.017), presence of orbital symptoms(p=0.002), presence of diabetic ketoacidosis(p=0.011) and cerebral involvement by Mucor(p=0.0004) were associated with increased risk of death. Duration of Amphotericin B therapy of [≥] 21 days was associated with statistically significant reduction in mortality(p=0.002). ConclusionsCAM is an uncommon, rapidly progressive, angioinvasive, opportunistic fungal infection which is fatal if left untreated. Combination of surgical debridement and antifungal therapy leads to clinical and radiologic improvement in majority of cases.","Dravid, Ameet; Kashiva, Reema; Khan, Zafer; Bande, Balasaheb; Memon, Danish; Kodre, Aparna; Potdar, Prashant; Mane, Milind; Tamboli, Asir; Pawar, Vishal; Patil, Dattatraya; Banerjee, Debashis; Bhoite, Kailas; Shinde, Akshay; Pharande, Reshma; Kalyani, Suraj; Raut, Prathamesh; Bapte, Madhura; Saldanha, Charlotte; Chandak, Dinesh; Ajani, Fouzia; Mehta, Anshul; Reddy, M Sateesh; Bhayani, Krushnadas; LaxmiS, S; VishnuP, D; Srivastava, Shipra; Khandelwal, Shubham; More, Sailee; Shakeel, Atif; Pawar, Mohit; Nande, Pranava; Harshe, Amol; Kadam, Sagar; Halikar, Sudhir; Kamal, Nudrat; Andrabi, Danish; Bodhale, Sachin; Raut, Akshay; Gawande, Pushkar; Bhandari, Ankush; Wasmatkar, Nilesh; Sarkar, Adnanali; Chandrashekhar, Sangeeta; Butiyani, Pallavi; Akhade, Geetanjali; Abnave, Aditi; Raman, Chandrashekhar; Basade, Siraj; Mahajan, Uma; Joshi, Gaurav; Mane, Dileep",,,164

337969,Response,2020,"Diabetic dyslipidemia (DD), characterized by increased plasma triglycerides (TGs) and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels, is a major factor contributing to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cardiovascular risk in type-2 diabetes. Activation of both the cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are associated with NASH progression. Here, we tested whether dual-targeting inhibition of hepatic CB1R and iNOS improves DD in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. DIO mice were treated for 14 days with (S)-MRI-1867, a peripherally-restricted hybrid inhibitor of CB1R and iNOS. (R)-MRI-1867, the CB1R-inactive stereoisomer which retains iNOS inhibitory activity and JD-5037, a peripherally-restricted CB1R antagonist were used to assess the relative contribution of the two targets to the effects of (S)-MRI-1867. (S)-MRI-1867 reduced hepatic steatosis, the rate of hepatic VLDL secretion, upregulated hepatic LDLR expression and reduced the circulating levels of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). The decrease in VLDL secretion could be attributed to CB1R blockade while the reduction of PCSK9 levels and the related increase in LDLR resulted from iNOS inhibition via a mTORC1-dependent mechanism. In conclusion, this approach based on the concomitant inhibition of CB1R and iNOS represents a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of dyslipidemia.","Roger, Célia; Buch, Chloé; Muller, Tania; Leemput, Julia; Demizieux, Laurent; Passilly-Degrace, Patricia; Cinar, Resat; Iyer, Malliga R; Kunos, George; Vergès, Bruno; Degrace, Pascal; Jourdan, Tony",Diabetes,,164

The impacts of income shocks on mental health may differ across U.S. states during the pandemic, as states have different policy contexts that likely influence mental health. The present study uses survey data from the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey (April-July 2020) to examine whether mental health outcomes vary across U.S. states and to what extent specific state-level contexts moderate the associations between household income shocks and depression (n = 582,440) and anxiety (n = 582,796). We find that the prevalence of depression and anxiety differs across states by household income shock status. For individuals, living in a state with supportive social policies - primarily those related to Medicaid, unemployment insurance, and suspended utility shut offs during the pandemic - weakens the association between household income shocks and mental health. Findings suggest that the lack of a strong federal response to the pandemic alongside the devolution of federal power to states over the past 40 years contributes to inequalities in mental health across states. We provide insight about how specific existing and emergency-related policies can reduce adverse mental health consequences of household income shocks.","Donnelly, Rachel; Farina, Mateo P",Soc Sci Med,,164

Currently, Annona fruits have attracted the attention of people interested in health-promoting foods due to their phytochemical content that their activities were not studied before. This study aimed to explore the potential antioxidant, antimicrobial, and in vitro anticancer activity of two cultivars Annona squamosa (Annona b. and Annona h.) seed, peel, and pulp. We also meausred phenolic, flavonoid, sulfated polysaccharide, tannins, and triterpenoids. Polyphenol identification was determined using RP-HPLC. Results of the antioxidant activity revealed that the highest activity was observed for Annona h. seed extract using DPPH and ABTS assays with IC50 6.07 ± 0.50 and 9.58 ± 0.53 µg/ml, respectively. The antimicrobial activity against various pathogenic strains revealed that the peel extracts of both Annona b. and Annona h. exhibited the best antimicrobial activity. We also assessed the IC50 values for anticancer activity in all six Annona b. and Annona h samples against four cancer cell lines colon (Caco-2), prostate (PC3), liver (HepG-2), and breast (MCF-7) using MTT assay. Annona b. and Annona h seed extracts had the lowest IC50 values for four cancer cell lines with 7.31 ± 0.03 and 15.99 ± 1.25 for PC-3 and MCF-7, respectively. Both seed extracts, Annona b. and Annona h., showed significantly down-regulated mRNA expression of Bcl-2 and up-regulated p53 in all treated cell lines. Apoptosis was evaluated using nuclear staining, flow cytometric analysis, and immunohistochemistry of the proliferation marker (Ki-67). Additional studies are required to characterize the bioactive compounds responsible for the observed activities of Annona seed and determine its mechanism as an anticancer drug.","Shehata, Mohamed Gamal; Abu-Serie, Marwa Muhammad; Abd El-Aziz, Nourhan Mohammad; El-Sohaimy, Sobhy Ahmed",Sci Rep,,164

341914,Breastfeeding mums are finally getting spaces to pump at some US institutions,2019,"Critical Care patients who experience symptoms of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) are commonly placed on mechanical ventilators to increase the oxygen being supplied to their pulmonary system. If patients' pulmonary inflammation is severe, they can experience ventilation-perfusion mismatch (V/Q mismatch) where blood flow and gas exchange are mismatched such that oxygen uptake is greatly impaired. In these cases, patients are typically rotated into a prone position to facilitate improved blood flow to segments of the lung that were not previously participating in the gas exchange process. However, proning a patient has a significant risk of complications. The low-cost vest presented in this work is designed to be used as a surrogate to patient proning while also requiring less hospital staff to operate than the proning process. The vest was preliminarily tested on 6 patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who experienced ARDS and presumptive V/Q mismatch. The results from this preliminary testing show that 5 out of 6 patients showed a significant increase in ventilation-perfusion similar to the effects of proning.","Ambrose, A.

345755,Coronapod: The variant blamed for India's catastrophic second wave,2021,"Emerging highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (CoVs) represent a serious ongoing threat to the public health worldwide. The spike (S) proteins of CoVs are surface glycoproteins that facilitate viral entry into host cells via attachment to their respective cellular receptors. The S protein is believed to be a major immunogenic component of CoVs and a target for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and most candidate vaccines. Development of a safe and convenient assay is thus urgently needed to determine the prevalence of CoVs nAbs in the population, to study immune response in infected individuals, and to aid in vaccines and viral entry inhibitor evaluation. While live virus-based neutralization assays are used as gold standard serological methods to detect and measure nAbs, handling of highly pathogenic live CoVs requires strict bio-containment conditions in biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) laboratories. On the other hand, use of replication-incompetent pseudoviruses bearing CoVs S proteins could represent a safe and useful method to detect nAbs in serum samples under biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) conditions. Here, we describe a detailed protocol of a safe and convenient assay to generate vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudoviruses to evaluate and measure nAbs against highly pathogenic CoVs. The protocol covers methods to produce VSV pseudovirus bearing the S protein of the Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), pseudovirus titration, and pseudovirus neutralization assay. Such assay could be adapted by different laboratories and researchers working on highly pathogenic CoVs without the need to handle live viruses in the BSL-3 environment.","Almahboub, Sarah A.; Algaissi, Abdullah; Alfaleh, Mohamed A.; ElAssouli, M-Zaki; Hashem, Anwar M.",Front.

We examined the relationship between proliferative and inflammatory properties of tissue macrophages by defining the impact of the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway, a central regulator of self-renewal, in alveolar macrophages (AMs). Activation of ß-catenin by Wnt ligand inhibited AM proliferation and stemness, but promoted inflammatory activity. In a murine influenza viral pneumonia model, ß-catenin-mediated AM inflammatory activity promoted acute host morbidity; in contrast, AM proliferation enabled repopulation of reparative AMs and tissue recovery following viral clearance. Mechanistically, Wnt treatment promoted ß-catenin-HIF-1&#945; interaction and glycolysis-dependent inflammation while suppressing mitochondrial metabolism and thereby, AM proliferation. Differential HIF-1&#945; activities distinguished proliferative and inflammatory AMs in vivo. This ß-catenin-HIF-1&#945; axis was conserved in human AMs and enhanced HIF-1&#945; expression associated with macrophage inflammation in COVID-19 patients. Thus, inflammatory and reparative activities of lung macrophages are regulated by ß-catenin-HIF-1&#945; signaling, with implications for the treatment of severe respiratory diseases.","Zhu, Bibo; Wu, Yue; Huang, Su; Zhang, Ruixuan; Son, Young Min; Li, Chaofan; Cheon, In Su; Gao, Xiaochen; Wang, Min; Chen, Yao; Zhou, Xian; Nguyen, Quynh; Phan, Anthony T; Behl, Supriya; Taketo, M Mark; Mack, Matthias; Shapiro, Virginia S; Zeng, Hu; Ebihara, Hideki; Mullon, John J; Edell, Eric S; Reisenauer, Janani S; Demirel, Nadir; Kern, Ryan M; Chakraborty, Rana; Cui, Weiguo; Kaplan, Mark H; Zhou, Xiaobo; Goldrath, Ananda W; Sun, Jie",Immunity,,164

358761,Corona Viruses - Current Knowledge - A Review,2020,"BACKGROUND: Few adolescents achieve sufficient levels of physical activity, and many are spending most of their time in sedentary behavior. Affective response following sedentary time may influence motivation to remain sedentary. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is a real-time data capture methodology that can be used to identify factors influencing sedentary time, such as the context of the home setting, and resulting affective state within a free-living setting. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between context at home and adolescent sedentary time, and the relationship of sedentary time and subsequent affect. METHODS: Adolescents (n = 284; 10-16 y) participated in an EMA study that used random, interval-based sampling methods. Adolescents each received 22 unannounced surveys over 7-days through a smartphone application. One survey was randomly sent within each 2-h time-period. These time-periods occurred between 4:00 pm-8:00 pm on weekdays and 8:00 am-8:00 pm on the weekend. This 15-question survey included a series of questions on context (indoors/outdoors, alone/not alone) and positive affect. Adolescents concurrently wore an accelerometer at the hip, and the 30-min bout of accelerometry data prior to each survey was used in analyses. Mixed-effect location scale models were used to examine the association between context at home and sedentary time (stage 1) and the adjusted sedentary time and positive affect (stage 2), with each model adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: Adolescents were 12.6 ± 1.9 y of age on average, about half were White (58%), and engaged in high levels of sedentary behavior during the 30 min prior to the survey (21.4 ± 6.8 min). Most surveys occurred when adolescents were with others (59%) and indoors (88%). In Stage 1, both being alone and being indoors at home were positively associated with sedentary time (p < 0.001 for both). In Stage 2, adjusted sedentary time was not related to positive affect. Age was negatively related to positive affect (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Both contextual factors, being alone and indoors at home, were related to additional time spent sedentary compared to being with someone or outdoors. After adjustment, sedentary time was not related to subsequent positive affect, indicating other factors may be related to adolescent's positive affect in home settings.","Kracht, Chelsea L; Beyl, Robbie A; Maher, Jaclyn P; Katzmarzyk, Peter T; Staiano, Amanda E",Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act,,164

362361,An uneven pandemic,2020,"Testing individuals for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is crucial for curtailing transmission chains. Moreover, rapidly testing many potentially infected individuals is often a limiting factor in controlling COVID-19 outbreaks. Hence, pooling strategies, wherein individuals are grouped and tested simultaneously, are employed. We present a novel pooling strategy that implements D-Optimal Pooling Experimental design (DOPE). DOPE defines optimal pooled tests as those maximizing the mutual information between data and infection states. We estimate said mutual information via Monte-Carlo sampling and employ a discrete optimization heuristic for maximizing it. DOPE outperforms common pooling strategies both in terms of lower error rates and fewer tests utilized. DOPE holds several additional advantages: it provides posterior distributions of the probability of infection, rather than only binary classification outcomes; it naturally incorporates prior information of infection probabilities and test error rates; and finally, it can be easily extended to include other, newly discovered information regarding COVID-19. Hence, we believe that implementation of Bayesian D-optimal experimental design holds a great promise for the efforts of combating COVID-19 and other future pandemics.","Daon, Yair; Huppert, Amit; Obolski, Uri",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.03706v1.pdf,164

Four online questionnaires were completed by general population samples from the US and the UK in June 2020 (N = 1198, N = 3890, N = 1663, N = 2237). After controls, all four studies found a positive association between intention to be vaccinated and usage of broadcast and print media. The three studies which operationalised media usage in terms of frequency found no effect for social media. However, the study which operationalised media use in terms of informational reliance found a negative effect for social media. Youth, low household income, female gender, below degree-level of education, and membership of other than white ethnic groups were each also found to be associated with lower intentions to be vaccinated in at least two of the four studies. In all four studies, intention to be vaccinated was positively associated with having voted either for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential elections or for Labour Party candidates in the 2019 UK general election. Neither of the UK studies found an association with having voted for Conservative Party candidates, but both US studies found a negative association between intention to be vaccinated and having voted for Donald Trump. The consistent finding of greater intention to be vaccinated among users of legacy media but not among users of social media suggests that social media do not currently provide an adequate replacement for legacy media, at least in terms of public health communication. The finding of a negative association with social media in the study which measured informational reliance rather than frequency is consistent with the view that uncritical consumption of social media may be acting to promote vaccine hesitancy.","Allington, Daniel; McAndrew, Siobhan; Moxham-Hall, Vivienne Louisa; Duffy, Bobby",Vaccine,,164

Although it has been suggested that elevated levels of blood neutrophils associate with worsening oxygenation in COVID-19, it is unknown whether neutrophils are drivers of the thrombo-inflammatory storm or simple bystanders. To better understand the potential role of neutrophils in COVID-19, we measured levels of the neutrophil activation marker S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) in hospitalized patients and determined its relationship to severity of illness and respiratory status. Patients with COVID-19 (n = 172) had markedly elevated levels of calprotectin in their blood. Calprotectin tracked with other acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and absolute neutrophil count, but was superior in identifying patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In longitudinal samples, calprotectin rose as oxygenation worsened. When tested on day 1 or 2 of hospitalization (n = 94 patients), calprotectin levels were significantly higher in patients who progressed to severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (8039 ± 7031 ng/ml, n = 32) as compared to those who remained free of intubation (3365 ± 3146, P < 0.0001). In summary, serum calprotectin levels track closely with current and future COVID-19 severity, implicating neutrophils as potential perpetuators of inflammation and respiratory compromise in COVID-19.","Shi, Hui; Zuo, Yu; Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi; Gockman, Kelsey; Zuo, Melanie; Madison, Jacqueline A; Blair, Christopher; Woodward, Wrenn; Lezak, Sean P; Lugogo, Njira L; Woods, Robert J; Lood, Christian; Knight, Jason S; Kanthi, Yogendra",J. leukoc. biol,,164

DESIGN: The study was a retrospective case-controlled study. PARTICIPANTS: There were 163 patients with COVID-19 deemed candidates for CPAP on admission, including 58 who subsequently required CPAP. OUTCOME MEASURES: On admission, we measured the proportion of patients meeting a composite 'negative' outcome of requiring CPAP, intubation or dying versus successful ward-based care. For those escalated to CPAP, 'negative' outcomes were intubation or death versus successful de-escalation of respiratory support. RESULTS: Our results were stratified into tertiles, those with 'moderate' or 'severe' X-rays on admission had significantly higher odds of negative outcome versus 'mild' (odds ratio (OR) 2.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.121-4.803; p=0.023; and OR 3.600; 95% CI 1.681-7.708; p=0.001, respectively). This could not be demonstrated in those commencing CPAP (OR 0.976; 95% CI 0.754-1.264; p=0.856). CONCLUSIONS: We outline a scoring system to stratify X-rays by severity and directly link this to prognosis.

An experiment was carried out to determine the response of digestibility, growth performance, and carcass quality in local Kandol pigs to incremental levels of FBS in rations. A total of 20 castrated male pigs were randomly allocated to five diets, containing 0, 400, 500, 600, and 700 g FBS of the ration. Daily feed on offer was provided as 4% of the body weight on a dry matter basis and offered three times per day. As result, the inclusion level of FBS was positively correlated with NR (p < 0.001, r = 0.68). The linear regression equation was y = 0.002x + 2.4276 (R2 = 0.63). Furthermore, it was also correlated with ADG (p < 0.05, r = 0.46) and with FCR (p < 0.05, r = - 0.45). The regression equation was y = 0.0634x + 174.2 (R2 = 0.43) and y = - 0.0009x + 4.6521 (R2 = 0.62) for ADG and FCR, respectively. The correlation between inclusion level of FBS and large intestine weight was also observed (p < 0.05, r = - 0.61). The R2 value was 63. However, there was no any correlation between the inclusion level of FBS and the percentages of hanging carcass, dressing carcass, pH, color score, marbling score of the meat, and WHC (p > 0.05). The economic benefit of using FBS to improve pig diets will depend on the availability of banana stems and the labor and processing costs.","Huy, Sokchea; Khieu, Borin; Chhay, Ty; Philp, Joshua N M; Le, Ngoan Duc; Tran, Hong Thi Thu",Trop Anim Health Prod,,164

However, most reports lack data on the metabolic syndrome itself. This study investigated prospectively the relationship between respiratory deterioration and the presence of metabolic syndrome or abdominal adiposity in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study analysing patients with respiratory symptoms who presented at a local emergency department in the Netherlands. The influence of abdominal adiposity-assessed by an increased waist-hip ratio-and metabolic syndrome on respiratory deterioration and the length of hospital stay were analysed with multivariable logistic regressions and Kaplan-Meier analyses. RESULTS: In total, 166 patients were analysed, of whom 86 (52%) tested positive for COVID-19. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome did not differ between patients with COVID-19 with and without the need for intubation or level of supportive care (37.5% vs 48.4%, p=0.338). In contrast, abdominal adiposity is an independent risk factor for respiratory distress in COVID-19, adjusted for metabolic syndrome, age, gender and BMI (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.20, p=0.014). CONCLUSION: This study shows that abdominal adiposity, and not the presence of metabolic syndrome, is associated with clinical deterioration in COVID-19. This prospective study provides further insight into the risk stratification of patients with COVID-19 based on a simple measurement as the waist and hip circumference.

According to the 2017 report of the European Commission in Mobility and Transport, the performance of all modes for passenger transport (roadways and airways) are reaching record highs. Although the benefits of the increased demand for mobility are substantial and welcome, an effort should be paid such as to ameliorate possible threatening side-effects that may also arise. As World Health Organization (WHO) denotes and as has been evident from the global COVID-19 epidemic outbreak, infectious diseases can be spread directly or indirectly from one person to another under common exposure circumstances such as air transportation (especially long-haul airline connections) that may act as the medium for transmitting and spreading infectious diseases. In this paper, analytical and realistic models have been integrated, for providing evidence on the spread dynamics of infectious diseases that may face Europe through the airlines system. In particular, a detailed epidemiological model has been integrated with the airlines' and land transport network, able to simulate the epidemic spread of infectious diseases originated from distant locations. Additionally, a wide set of experiments and simulations have been conducted, providing results from detailed stress-tests covering both mild as well as aggressive cases of epidemic spreading scenarios. The results provide convincing evidence on the effectiveness that the European airports' system offer in controlling the emergence of epidemics, but also on the time and extent that controlling measures should be taken in order to break the chain of infections in realistic cases.","Nikolaou, Paraskevas; Dimitriou, Loukas",J Air Transp Manag,,164

We aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of 30-mAs chest CT protocol in comparison with a 150-mAs standard-dose routine protocol for imaging of COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Upon IRB approval, consecutive laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 patients aged 50 years or older who were referred for chest CT scan and had same-day normal CXR were invited to participate in this prospective study. First, a standard-dose chest CT scan (150 mAs) was performed. Only if typical COVID-19 pneumonia features were identified, then a low-dose CT (30 mAs) was done immediately. Diagnostic accuracy of low-dose and standard-dose CT in the detection of typical COVID-19 pneumonia features were compared. RESULTS: Twenty patients with a mean age of 64.20 ± 13.8 were enrolled in the study. There was excellent intrareader agreement in detecting typical findings of COVID-19 pneumonia between low-dose and standard-dose (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.98-0.99, P values < 0.001 all readers). The mean effective dose values in standard- and low-dose groups were 6.60 ± 1.47 and 1.80 ± 0.42 mSv, respectively. Also, absolute cancer risk per mean cumulative effective dose values obtained from the standard- and low-dose CT examinations were 2.71 × 10-4 and 0.74 × 10-4, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: According to our study, it was found that proposed low-dose CT chest protocol is reliable in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia in daily practice with significant reduction in radiation dose and estimated cancer risk.","Tabatabaei, Seyed Mohammad Hossein; Talari, Hamidreza; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali; Farhood, Bagher; Rahimi, Habibollah; Razzaghi, Reza; Mehri, Narges; Rajebi, Hamid",Emerg Radiol,,164

381899,Modeling the Dynamics of Coronavirus Disease Pandemic Coupled with Fear Epidemics,2021,"Adequate antipsychotic treatment intensity is required for defining treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) and justifying clozapine treatment. We investigated the occurrence of undetectable or subtherapeutic serum levels of oral antipsychotics preceding switch to clozapine as an endpoint of TRS. For patients starting clozapine, 12-month retrospective reviews of antipsychotic serum concentration measurements were performed in a Norwegian therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) database from 2005 to 2017. Undetectable levels in high-sensitive analytical assays defined 'no drug use', while levels <50% of the lower reference range defined 'subtherapeutic use'. Similar data were collected for patients switching to long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics, as a reference of 'no or subtherapeutic drug use'. Nineteen of 353 patients initiating clozapine (5.4%) had a recent history of undetectable antipsychotic drug levels compared to 91 of 1048 (8.7%) initiating LAI. Another 19 patients starting clozapine (5.4%) had recent events of subtherapeutic levels. In conclusion, the present retrospective study may indicate that every 10th patient starting clozapine has a recent history of undetectable or subtherapeutic serum levels of oral antipsychotics. The clinical implications of the present study for the assessment of TRS should be investigated prospectively in further studies.","Kyllesø, Lennart; Smith, Robert Løvsletten; Karlstad, Øystein; Andreassen, Ole A; Molden, Espen",NPJ Schizophr,,164

387059,In the Final Analysis,2021,"Although vaccination campaigns are currently being rolled out to prevent coronavirus disease (COVID-19), antivirals will remain an important adjunct to vaccination. Antivirals against coronaviruses do not exist, hence global drug repurposing efforts have been carried out to identify agents that may provide clinical benefit to patients with COVID-19. Itraconazole, an antifungal agent, has been reported to have activity against animal coronaviruses. Using cell-based phenotypic assays, the in vitro antiviral activity of itraconazole and 17-OH itraconazole was assessed against clinical isolates from a German and Belgian patient infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Itraconazole demonstrated antiviral activity in human Caco-2 cells (EC50 = 2.3 µM; 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay). Similarly, its primary metabolite, 17-OH itraconazole, showed inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 activity (EC50 = 3.6 µM). Remdesivir inhibited viral replication with an EC50 = 0.4 µM. Itraconazole and 17-OH itraconazole resulted in a viral yield reduction in vitro of approximately 2-log10 and approximately 1-log10 , as measured in both Caco-2 cells and VeroE6-eGFP cells, respectively. The viral yield reduction brought about by remdesivir or GS-441524 (parent nucleoside of the antiviral prodrug remdesivir; positive control) was more pronounced, with an approximately 3-log10 drop and >4-log10 drop in Caco-2 cells and VeroE6-eGFP cells, respectively. Itraconazole and 17-OH itraconazole exert in vitro low micromolar activity against SARS-CoV-2. Despite the in vitro antiviral activity, itraconazole did not result in a beneficial effect in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a clinical study (EudraCT Number: 2020-001243-15).","Van Damme, Ellen; De Meyer, Sandra; Bojkova, Denisa; Ciesek, Sandra; Cinatl, Jindrich; De Jonghe, Steven; Jochmans, Dirk; Leyssen, Pieter; Buyck, Christophe; Neyts, Johan; Van Loock, Marnix",J Med Virol,,164

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a history of cardiovascular disease or cancer affects the risk of dying after a COVID-19 diagnosis in Norway. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data were compiled from the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases, the Norwegian Cardiovascular Disease Registry and the Cancer Registry of Norway. Univariable and multivariable regression models were used to calculate both relative and absolute risk. RESULTS: In the first half of 2020, 8 809 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 260 COVID-19-associated deaths were registered. Increasing age, male sex (relative risk (RR): 1.5; confidence interval (CI): 1.2-2.0), prior stroke (RR: 1.5; CI: 1.0-2.1) and cancer with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis (RR: 3.0; CI: 1.1-8.2) were independent risk factors for death after a diagnosis of COVID-19. After adjusting for age and sex, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, hypertension, and non-metastatic cancer were no longer statistically significant risk factors for death. INTERPRETATION: The leading risk factor for death among individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 was age. Male sex, and a previous diagnosis of stroke or cancer with distant metastasis were also associated with an increased risk of death after a COVID-19 diagnosis.","Kvåle, Rune; Bønaa, Kaare Harald; Forster, Rachel; Gravningen, Kirsten; Júlíusson, Pétur Benedikt; Myklebust, Tor Åge",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,,164
387308,India's COVID-vaccine woes - by the numbers,2021,"The Hopi Tribe is a sovereign nation home to ~7500 Hopi persons living primarily in 12 remote villages. The Hopi Tribe, like many other American Indian nations, has been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. On 18 May 2020, a team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was deployed on the request of the tribe in response to increases in COVID-19 cases. Collaborating with Hopi Health Care Center (the reservation's federally run Indian Health Service health facility) and CDC, the Hopi strengthened public health systems and response capacity from May to August including: (1) implementing routine COVID-19 surveillance reporting; (2) establishing the Hopi Incident Management Authority for rapid coordination and implementation of response activities across partners; (3) implementing a community surveillance programme to facilitate early case detection and educate communities on COVID-19 prevention; and (4) applying innovative communication strategies to encourage mask wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing. These efforts, as well as community adherence to mitigation measures, helped to drive down cases in August. As cases increased in September-November, the improved capacity gained during the first wave of the pandemic enabled the Hopi leadership to have real-time awareness of the changing epidemiological landscape. This prompted rapid response coordination, swift scale up of health communications and redeployment of the community surveillance programme. The Hopi experience in strengthening their public health systems to better confront COVID-19 may be informative to other indigenous peoples as they also respond to COVID-19 within the context of disproportionate burden.","Humeyestewa, Duane; Burke, Rachel M; Kaur, Harpriya; Vicenti, Darren; Jenkins, Royce; Yatabe, Graydon; Hirschman, Jocelyn; Hamilton, Joyce; Fazekas, Kathleen; Leslie, Gary; Sehongva, Gregory; Honanie, Kay; Tu039,; tsi, Edison; Mayer, Oren; Rose, Michelle Ann; Diallo, Yvette; Damon, Scott; Zilversmit Pao, Leah; McCraw, H Mac; Talawyma, Bruce; Herne, Mose; Nuvangyaoma, Timothy L; Welch, Seh; Balajee, S Arunmozhi",,,164

387970,What Has It Meant for Me to Be an Epidemiologist in 2020?,2021,"Fluorescence spectroscopy has gained much attention over the last few years. Its advantages cover both analytical performance as well as ecological greenness. The quality control of pharmaceuticals requires sensitive, fast and economic methodologies to provide a high throughput at desirable costs. The low energy and decreased solvent consumption make this technique green as well as economic, and hence it is much preferred by pharmaceutical industries. Remdesivir is a recent antiviral, previously used for the treatment of Ebola virus infections, which was approved by the US-FDA in 2020 for treatment of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. Formulation and wide-scale production of this drug started recently and hence methodologies related to its quality control are highly required. A smart spectrofluorimetric method was validated as per the US-FDA guidelines for the facile estimation of Remdesivir. The assay of Remdesivir was based on its native fluorescence measurements at pH 4 and wavelengths of 244/405 nm. Calibration was achieved over the range of 1.0-65.0 ng mL-1. Different variables affecting the proposed methodology were studied to achieve maximum sensitivity, at limits of detection and quantification of 0.287 and 0.871 ng mL-1, respectively. The developed method is regarded as the first spectrofluorimetric one for the estimation of Remdesivir. The developed method was also utilized for the determination of the drug in its formulated IV infusion and in spiked human plasma. Statistical analysis verified that this method is accurate and reproducible. Moreover, the ecological impact of the developed procedures was evaluated on two recently reported assessment metrics, the Green Analytical Procedure Index (GAPI) and AGREE-analytical greenness metric, to emphasize the greenness of the procedure.","Elmansi, Heba; Ibrahim, Adel Ehab; Mikhail, Ibraam E; Belal, Fathalla",Anal Methods,,164
388242,Cluster-based dual evolution for multivariate systems,2020-05-05,"The emergence of COVID-19 and the spread of this novel disease around the world in 2020 has entailed several cultural changes; some of those changes are positive for the environment, such as the decrease in the concentration of atmospheric particulate matter. We compared the concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 recorded in October and November 2019 (pre-pandemic period) with the concentrations recorded from May to October 2020 (pandemic period) in the city of Arequipa, Peru. A significant decrease in the concentration of PM2.5 (less than 21.0%) and PM10 (less than 21.5%) was observed on Sundays, when population movement was strongly restricted. First, we observed a significant correlation between PM2.5 and PM10 concentration in the atmosphere and the number of infections reported in Arequipa, Peru. However, when we removed the data of Sundays from the database, these correlations were no longer significant. Subsequently, we correlated PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations with the number of COVID-19 infections on the same day and up to a 20-day delay and found that from day 15 to day 18, PM10 concentration was significantly correlated with COVID-19 infections, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might circulate attached to the coarse particle (PM10) and that this fraction would act as infection vector. However, these results may reflect other factors, such as social or economic factors that could explain the dynamics of infection in Arequipa, Peru. Further research is needed to better understand the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Wannaz, Eduardo D; Larrea Valdivia, Adriana E; Reyes Larico, Juan A; Salcedo Peña, Jimena; Valenzuela Huillca, Carlos",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

Methods: The numbers of histopathological and cytological reports, newly diagnosed cancers of breast, lung, colon, endometrium, and prostate, molecular tests for EGFR mutations and HPV were extracted. Two periods, from March 1 to September 30 in 2019 and 2020 were analysed and compared, as the periods before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The total number of reports was statistically significantly lower during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, compared to the same period in 2019 (p&lt;0.000), histopathology by 24%, non-gynecological cytology by 20%, gynecological cytology by 13%, and Pap tests by 11%. During COVID-19 compared to the same period in 2019 the number of newly diagnosed malignant tumors was significantly reduced for colon cancers (–25%, p &lt;0.0001). The decrease in the new cases of breast (–3%) and prostate cancer (–4%) was less pronounced while the increase was recorded for lung (+ 2%) and endometrial cancer (+ 53%).

390915,Why airport screening won’t stop the spread of coronavirus,2020,"INTRODUCTION: A consultation dedicated to symptomatic health professionals was opened at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in order to meet the specific needs of this population. The objective of this work was to estimate the frequency of SARS-Cov-2 nasopharyngeal carriage in symptomatic healthcare workers suspected of having COVID-19 and to determine the factors associated with this carriage. METHODS: Of the 522 consultants, 308 worked in the Hospital and 214 outside. They had mild forms of COVID-19 and non-specific clinical signs with the exception of agueusia/anosmia, which was significantly more common in those with positive RT-PCR. The rate of RT-PCR positivity was 38% overall, without significant difference according to profession. It was higher among external consultants (47% versus 31%). In the hospital, this rate was significantly lower for symptomatic staff in the care sectors, compared to staff in the technical platforms and laboratories (24%, versus 45%, p = 0.006 and 54%, respectively, p < 0.001), but did not differ between staff in COVID units and other care sectors (30% versus 28%). Among the external consultants, the positivity rates of nursing home and private practices staff (53% and 55% respectively) were more than double that of acute care hospital staff (24%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the strong impact of COVID-19 on health professionals. The higher positivity rates among symptomatic professionals working outside the hospital compared to those working in hospital may be explained in part by a shortage of protective equipment and by difficulties in accessing virological diagnosis, which were greater outside the hospital when the epidemic began.","Greffe, S; Espinasse, F; Duran, C; Labrune, S; Sirol, M; Mantalvan, B; Gramer, M C; Babulle, C; Do Rosario, G; Vauvillier, Q; Huet, A; Van der Heidjen, A; Tysebaert, J; Kramarz, L F; Rabes, J-P; Pellissier, G; Chinet, T; Moreau, F; Rouveix, E",Rev Med Interne,,164

As part of physical distancing measures, the CDC is recommending that schools who traditionally have had students eat in a cafeteria or common large space instead have children eat their lunch or other meals in the classroom at already physically distanced desks. This has sparked concern for the safety of food-allergic children attending school, and some question of how the new CDC recommendations can coexist with recommendations in the 2013 CDC Voluntary Guidelines on Managing Food Allergy in Schools as well as accommodations that students may be afforded through disability law that may have previously prohibited eating in the classroom. This expert consensus explores the issues related to evidence-based management of food allergy at school, the issues of managing the health of children attending school that are acutely posed by the constraints of an infectious pandemic, and how to harmonize these needs so that all children can attend school with minimal risk from both an infectious and allergic standpoint.","Greenhawt, Matthew; Shaker, Marcus; Stukus, David R; Fleischer, David M; Hourihane, Jonathan; Tang, Mimi L K; Abrams, Elissa M; Wang, Julie; Bingemann, Theresa A; Chan, Edmond S; Lieberman, Jay; Sampson, Hugh A; Bock, S Allan; Young, Michael C; Waserman, Susan; Mack, Douglas P",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,,164

Attendance at school and access to ECEC is critical to a child's learning, well-being and health. School closures increase inequities by disproportionately affecting vulnerable children. Here, we summarise the role of children and adolescents in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and that of schools and ECECs in community transmission and describe the Australian experience. In Australia, most SARS-CoV-2 cases in schools were solitary (77% in NSW and 67% in Victoria); of those that did progress to an outbreak, >90% involved fewer than 10 cases. Australian and global experience has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly introduced into schools and ECECs during periods of heightened community transmission. Implementation of public health mitigation strategies, including effective testing, tracing and isolation of contacts, means schools and ECECs can be safe, not drivers of transmission. Schools and ECEC are essential services and so they should be prioritised to stay open for face-to-face learning. This is particularly critical as we continue to manage the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Koirala, Archana; Goldfeld, Sharon; Bowen, Asha C; Choong, Catherine; Ryan, Kathleen; Wood, Nicholas; Winkler, Noni; Danchin, Margie; Macartney, Kristine; Russell, Fiona M",J. paediatr. child health,,164
395046,A new frontier: alcohol sponsorship activation through esports,2021,"The emergence and re-emergence of coronaviruses (CoV) continually cause circulating epidemics and pandemics worldwide, such as the on-going outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The resultant disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has rapidly developed into a worldwide pandemic, leading to severe health and economic burdens. Although the recently announced vaccines against COVID-19 has rekindled hope, there is still a major challenge to urgently meet the global need for rapid treatment of the pandemic. Given the urgency of the CoV outbreak, we propose a strategy to screen potential broad-spectrum drugs against CoV in a high-throughput manner, particularly against SARS-CoV-2. Since the essential functional domains of CoV are extensively homologous, the availability of two types of mild CoV, HCoV-OC43 and MHV, should provide a valuable tool for the rapid identification of promising drugs against CoV without the drawbacks of level three biological confinements. The luciferase reporter gene is introduced into HCoV-OC43 and MHV to indicate viral activity, and hence the antiviral efficiency of screened drugs can be quantified by luciferase activity. Compounds with antiviral activity against both HCoV-OC43 and MHV are further evaluated in SARS-CoV-2 after structural optimizations. This system allows large-scale compounds to be screened to search for broad-spectrum drugs against CoV in a high-throughput manner, providing potential alternatives for clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 or other CoV.","Liu, Jia; Li, Kang; Cheng, Lin; Shao, Jingjin; Yang, Shukun; Zhang, Wei; Zhou, Guangqian; de Vries, Antoine A F; Yu, Zhiyi",Int J Infect Dis,,164

While some recent studies unveil associations between the network structure and the underlying dynamical process, identifying stochastic nonlinear dynamical processes continues to be an outstanding problem. Here we develop a simple data-driven framework based on operator-theoretic techniques to identify and control stochastic nonlinear dynamics taking place over large-scale networks. The proposed approach requires no prior knowledge of the network structure and identifies the underlying dynamics solely using a collection of two-step snapshots of the states. This data-driven system identification is achieved by using the Koopman operator to find a low dimensional representation of the dynamical patterns that evolve linearly. Further, we use the global linear Koopman model to solve critical control problems by applying to model predictive control (MPC)--typically, a challenging proposition when applied to large networks. We show that our proposed approach tackles this by converting the original nonlinear programming into a more tractable optimization problem that is both convex and with far fewer variables.","Tavasoli, Ali; Henry, Teague; Shakeri, Heman",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02005v1.pdf,164

398823,Three-Dimensional Analysis of Particle Distribution on Filter Layers inside N95 Respirators by Deep Learning,2020,"Purpose of Review: Modified risk products (MRP) such as electronic vaping cigarettes (EVC) and heat-not-burn cigarettes (HNBC) are alternatives to traditional combustion cigarettes (TCC) with an expanding consumer base. Yet, their cardiovascular health risks are still unclear. We aimed to summarize the evidence base on this topic by conducting an updated umbrella review. Recent Findings: We identified 7 systematic reviews, totaling 183 studies and reports, ranging from in vitro and in animal studies to clinical studies in apparently healthy volunteers and patients at risk of cardiovascular disease. Overall, acute EVC use was associated with several toxic effects at molecular, cellular, tissue, organ, and system level. In addition, EVC impacted adversely on blood pressure (BP) management, caused tachycardia, and worsened arterial stiffness. Finally, EVC use was associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical events, including atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction, even if the causal link is still debated. Most reviews highlighted that the detrimental impact of EVC was of lesser magnitude of that of TCC. In addition, the differential impact of liquids and nicotine was not clearly disentangled. Finally, no review included studies on HNBC. Summary: The present umbrella review suggests that EVC, and likely HNBC, despite clearly causing an increase in overall cardiovascular risk, may represent a temporary lesser evil than TCC in a risk-reduction or risk-modification strategy, aiming for eventual abstinence from all tobacco or nicotine products.","Peruzzi, Mariangela; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; Carnevale, Roberto; Cavarretta, Elena; Frati, Giacomo; Versaci, Francesco",Curr Emerg Hosp Med Rep,,164
399194,"International external quality assessment for SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection and survey on clinical laboratory preparedness during the COVID-19 pandemic, April/May 2020",2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic since its first appearance in late 2019. Deaths caused by COVID-19 are still increasing day by day and early diagnosis has become crucial. Since current diagnostic methods have many disadvantages, new investigations are needed to improve the performance of diagnosis. METHODS: A novel method is proposed to automatically diagnose COVID-19 by using Electrocardiogram (ECG) data with deep learning for the first time. Moreover, a new and effective method called hexaxial feature mapping is proposed to represent 12-lead ECG to 2D colorful images. Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) method is used to extract features and generate hexaxial mapping images. These generated images are then fed into a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to diagnose COVID-19. RESULTS: Two different classification scenarios are conducted on a publicly available paper-based ECG image dataset to reveal the diagnostic capability and performance of the proposed approach. In the first scenario, ECG data labeled as COVID-19 and No-Findings (normal) are classified to evaluate COVID-19 classification ability. According to results, the proposed approach provides encouraging COVID-19 detection performance with an accuracy of 96.20% and F1-Score of 96.30%. In the second scenario, ECG data labeled as Negative (normal, abnormal, and myocardial infarction) and Positive (COVID-19) are classified to evaluate COVID-19 diagnostic ability. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach provides satisfactory COVID-19 prediction performance with an accuracy of 93.00% and F1-Score of 93.20%. Furthermore, different experimental studies are conducted to evaluate the robustness of the proposed approach. CONCLUSION: Automatic detection of cardiovascular changes caused by COVID-19 can be possible with a deep learning framework through ECG data. This not only proves the presence of cardiovascular changes caused by COVID-19 but also reveals that ECG can potentially be used in the diagnosis of COVID-19. We believe the proposed study may provide a crucial decision-making system for healthcare professionals.

Statistical methods were used to test the relationship between the pre-determined influencing factors and the effectiveness of correction. The experiment was conducted based on the false information data about COVID-19 epidemic collected from Sina Weibo. Results show that a higher proportion of false information in a correction reduces the effectiveness, and explaining the reason improves the effectiveness.

402192,Fit-for-purpose urban wastewater reuse: Analysis of issues and available technologies for sustainable multiple barrier approaches,2020,"Influenza virus infection is characterized by symptoms ranging from mild congestion and body aches to severe pulmonary edema and respiratory failure. While the majority of those exposed have minor symptoms and recover with little morbidity, an estimated 500,000 people succumb to IAV-related complications each year worldwide. In these severe cases, an exaggerated inflammatory response, known as ""cytokine storm"", occurs which results in damage to the respiratory epithelial barrier and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Data from retrospective human studies as well as experimental animal models of influenza virus infection highlight the fine line between an excessive and an inadequate immune response, where the host response must balance viral clearance with exuberant inflammation. Current pharmacological modulators of inflammation, including corticosteroids and statins, have not been successful in improving outcomes during influenza virus infection. We have reported that the amplitude of the inflammatory response is regulated by Linear Ubiquitin Assembly Complex (LUBAC) activity and that dampening of LUBAC activity is protective during severe influenza virus infection. Therapeutic modulation of LUBAC activity may be crucial to improve outcomes during severe influenza virus infection, as it functions as a molecular rheostat of the host response. Here we review the evidence for modulating inflammation to ameliorate influenza virus infection-induced lung injury, data on current anti-inflammatory strategies, and potential new avenues to target viral inflammation and improve outcomes.","Brazee, Patricia L; Sznajder, Jacob I",Arch Bronconeumol,,164

Even prior to COVID-19, the literature had identified 3 separate shortcomings in the current formula that had not been addressed. Here, these shortcomings are integrated into a unifying framework that allows for a comparison between an adjusted formula, that accounts for all these shortcomings, and the current unadjusted formula, that does not account for these shortcomings. Using some average data from the literature, the current unadjusted formula gives the misleading impression that the government will provide 71% of the cost of a nutritious diet with households responsible for 29%. However, working with the adjusted formula, that takes into account the shortcomings, reveals the government actually only provides 41% of the adjusted cost of a nutritious diet and households are responsible for 59%.

409029,Aung Myint and trevor Jones respond,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) continues to challenge the limits of our knowledge and our healthcare system. Here we sought to define the host immune response, a.k.a, the ""cytokine storm"" that has been implicated in fatal COVID-19 using an AI-based approach. METHOD: Over 45,000 transcriptomic datasets of viral pandemics were analyzed to extract a 166-gene signature using ACE2 as a 'seed' gene; ACE2 was rationalized because it encodes the receptor that facilitates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) into host cells. An AI-based approach was used to explore the utility of the signature in navigating the uncharted territory of Covid-19, setting therapeutic goals, and finding therapeutic solutions. FINDINGS: The 166-gene signature was surprisingly conserved across all viral pandemics, including COVID-19, and a subset of 20-genes classified disease severity, inspiring the nomenclatures ViP and severe-ViP signatures, respectively. The ViP signatures pinpointed a paradoxical phenomenon wherein lung epithelial and myeloid cells mount an IL15 cytokine storm, and epithelial and NK cell senescence and apoptosis determine severity/fatality. Precise therapeutic goals could be formulated; these goals were met in high-dose SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamsters using either neutralizing antibodies that abrogate SARS-CoV-2â¢ACE2 engagement or a directly acting antiviral agent, EIDD-2801. IL15/IL15RA were elevated in the lungs of patients with fatal disease, and plasma levels of the cytokine prognosticated disease severity. INTERPRETATION: The ViP signatures provide a quantitative and qualitative framework for titrating the immune response in viral pandemics and may serve as a powerful unbiased tool to rapidly assess disease severity and vet candidate drugs.

To mitigate the effects of the virus on public health and the global economy, vaccines were rapidly developed. In less than one year, with respect to usual clinical development rules, several vaccines have been put on the market and mass vaccination campaigns have been deployed. During the phase I to phase III clinical trials, most of these vaccines have demonstrated both their safety and efficacy. Despite questions remain about the impact of virus variants and the duration of the immune response, messenger RNA (mRNA)-based and adenoviral vectored vaccines have demonstrated an overall efficacy from 70 to 95% in both phase III trials and real life. In addition, all these vaccines also reduce the severe forms of the disease and might strongly impact the mortality which could change the course of the pandemic.","Deplanque, Dominique; Launay, Odile",Therapie,,164

Radio-frequency sensors (e.g., radars) offer the means to monitor cardiorespiratory activity of people without compromising their privacy, however, only limited information can be obtained via movement, traditionally related to heart or breathing rate. We investigated whether five complex hemodynamics scenarios (resting, apnea simulation, Valsalva maneuver, tilt up and tilt down on a tilt table) can be classified directly from publicly available contact and radar input signals in an end-to-end deep learning approach. A series of robust k-fold cross-validation evaluation experiments were conducted in which neural network architectures and hyperparameters were optimized, and different data input modalities (contact, radar and fusion) and data types (time and frequency domain) were investigated. We achieved reasonably high accuracies of 88% for contact, 83% for radar and 88% for fusion of modalities. These results are valuable in showing large potential of radar sensing even for more complex scenarios going beyond just heart and breathing rate. Such contact-free sensing can be valuable for fast privacy-preserving hospital screenings and for cases where traditional werables are impossible to use.","Slapnicar, Gasper; Wang, Wenjin; Lustrek, Mitja",Sensors (Basel),,164

420097,Symposium 8,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the prescription pattern of antiepileptics and the relationship between antiepileptics and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in a Japanese population. METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted by reviewing the medical records of patients who visited or were admitted to a single tertiary care center between January 2011 and June 2019, were treated with antiepileptics, and developed allergic ADRs associated with these drugs. RESULTS: In total, 14,230 unique patients received antiepileptics during the study period. Diazepam was the most frequently used antiepileptic drug (74.8 %), followed by phenobarbital (14.3 %), valproic acid (11.4 %), fosphenytoin (10.0 %), and carbamazepine (7.3 %). Although a trend of increasing prevalence of newer generation antiepileptics was noted, most patients are still treated with older generation antiepileptics. Thirty-two (0.22 %) unique patients experienced ADRs associated with antiepileptics, and the antiepileptic drug most frequently associated with ADRs was carbamazepine, at a rate of 1.4 %. Three patients developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, in two of which carbamazepine was implicated. Most patients experienced ADRs associated with aromatic antiepileptics (84.4 %) or older generation antiepileptics (81.3 %). SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study to assess the relationship between ADRs and antiepileptics at a tertiary care center in Japan. Based on our results, most patients were prescribed older generation antiepileptics, and most ADR events were linked to the administration of drugs in this category; thus, identification of patients at risk of developing ADRs is critical in order to prevent such events.","Hikino, Keiko; Abe, Yuichi; Sakashita, Kazumi; Ozeki, Takeshi; Mushiroda, Taisei",Epilepsy Res,,164

However, it has not yet been demonstrated whether Tsk describes any individual variability in whole-body sweat rate (WBSR) independently of the evaporative requirement for heat balance (Ereq). METHODS: 140 bouts of 2-h treadmill walking completed by a pool of 21 participants (23±4 y, 174±8 cm, 76±11 kg, 1.9±0.2 m) under up to 9 conditions were analyzed. Trials employed varying rates of metabolic heat production (Hprod) (197-813 W), and environmental conditions (15°C, 20°C, 25°C, 30°C; all 50% RH), yielding a wide range of Ereq (86-684 W) and Tsk values (26.9-34.4°C). RESULTS: The individual variation observed in WBSR was best described using Ereq (in W) (R=0.784) as a sole descriptor, relative to Ereq (in W·m) (R=0.735), Hprod (in W) (R=0.639), Hprod (in W·m) (R=0.584), Ta (R=0.263) and Tsk (R=0.077); all P<0.001. A multiple stepwise linear regression included only Ereq (in W) (adjusted R=0.784), with Tsk not significantly correlating with the residual variance (P=0.285), independently of Ereq (in W). Hprod (in W) had similar predictive strength to Ereq (in W) at a fixed air temperature, explaining only 5.2% at 30°C, 4.9% at 25°C, 2.7% at 20°C and 0.5% at 15°C (all P<0.001) less variance in WBSR compared to Ereq. However, when data from all ambient temperatures were pooled, Hprod alone was a markedly worse predictor of WBSR than Ereq (R=0.639 vs. 0.784; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Ereq (in W) explained approximately four-fifths of the individual variation in WBSR over a range of ambient temperatures and exercise intensities, while Tsk did not explain any residual variance independently of Ereq.","Hospers, Lily; Cheuvront, Samuel N; Kenefick, Robert W; Jay, Ollie",Med. sci. sports exerc,,164

422632,Doomsday preppers and the architecture of dread,2020,"While SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for cell entry, it is important to examine other potential interactions between the virus and other cell receptors. Based on the clinical observation of low prevalence of smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we examined and identified a ""toxin-like"" amino acid (aa) sequence in the Receptor Binding Domain of the Spike Glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (aa 375-390), which is homologous to a sequence of the Neurotoxin homolog NL1, one of the many snake venom toxins that are known to interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). We present the 3D structural location of this ""toxin-like"" sequence on the Spike Glycoprotein and the superposition of the modelled structure of the Neurotoxin homolog NL1 and the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein. We also performed computational molecular modelling and docking experiments using 3D structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein and the extracellular domain of the nAChR &#945;9 subunit. We identified a main interaction between the aa 381-386 of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein and the aa 189-192 of the extracellular domain of the nAChR &#945;9 subunit, a region which forms the core of the ""toxin-binding site"" of the nAChRs. The mode of interaction is very similar to the interaction between the &#945;9 nAChR and &#945;-bungarotoxin. A similar interaction was observed between the pentameric &#945;7 AChR chimera and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein. The findings raise the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may interact with nAChRs, supporting the hypothesis of dysregulation of the nicotinic cholinergic system being implicated in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Nicotine and other nicotinic cholinergic agonists may protect nAChRs and thus have therapeutic value in COVID-19 patients.","Farsalinos, Konstantinos; Eliopoulos, Elias; Leonidas, Demetres D; Papadopoulos, Georgios E; Tzartos, Socrates; Poulas, Konstantinos",,,164
422773,It's time to consider a patent reprieve for COVID vaccines,2021,"Predicting COVID-19 severity is difficult, and the biological pathways involved are not fully understood. To approach this problem, we measured 4,701 circulating human protein abundances in two independent cohorts totaling 986 individuals. We then trained prediction models including protein abundances and clinical risk factors to predict adverse COVID-19 outcomes in 417 subjects and tested these models in a separate cohort of 569 individuals. For severe COVID-19, a baseline model including age and sex provided an area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 65% in the test cohort. Selecting 92 proteins from the 4,701 unique protein abundances improved the AUC to 88% in the training cohort, which remained relatively stable in the testing cohort at 86%, suggesting good generalizability. Proteins selected from different adverse COVID-19 outcomes were enriched for cytokine and cytokine receptors, but more than half of the enriched pathways were not immune-related. Taken together, these findings suggest that circulating proteins measured at early stages of disease progression are reasonably accurate predictors of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Further research is needed to understand how to incorporate protein measurement into clinical care.","Mr., Chen-Yang Su; Zhou, Sirui; Gonzalez-Kozlova, Edgar; Butler-Laporte, Guillaume; Brunet-Ratnasingham, Elsa; Nakanishi, Tomoko; Jeon, Wonseok; Morrison, David; Laurent, Laetitia; Afilalo, Joanthan; Afilalo, Marc; Henry, Danielle; Chen, Yiheng; Carrasco-Zanini, Julia; Farjoun, Yossi; Pietzner, Maik; Kimchi, Nofar; Afrasiabi, Zaman; Rezk, Nardin; Bouab, Meriem; Petitjean, Louis; Guzman, Charlotte; Xue, Xiaoqing; Tselios, Chris; Vulesevic, Branka; Adeleye, Olumide; Abdullah, Tala; Almamlouk, Noor; Moussa, Yara; DeLuca, Chantal; Duggan, Naomi; Schurr, Erwin; Brassard, Nathalie; Durand, Madeleine; Valle, Diane Marie Del; Thompson, Ryan; Cedillo, Mario A.; Schadt, Eric; Nie, Kai; Simons, Nicole W; Mouskas, Konstantinos; Zaki, Nicolas; Patel, Manishkumar; Xie, Hui; Harris, Jocelyn; Marvin, Robert; Cheng, Esther; Tuballes, Kevin; Argueta, Kimberly; Scott, Ieisha; Team, - The Mount Sinai COVID Biobank; Greenwood, Celia M T; Paterson, Clare; Hinterberg, Michael; Langenberg, Claudia; Forgetta, Vincenzo; Pineau, Joelle; Mooser, Vincent; Marron, Thomas; Beckmann, Noam; Kenigsberg, Ephraim; Kim-schulze, Seunghee; Charney, Alexander W.; Gnjatic, Sacha; Kaufmann, Daniel E.; Merad, Miriam; Richards, J Brent",,,164

Most of them were male (n = 104; 72%), were overweight (n = 99; 68%), and had hypertension (n = 83; 57%) and diabetes (n = 46; 32%). Few patients presented preexisting host risk factors for invasive fungal infection (n = 20; 14%). Their global severity was high; all patients were on invasive mechanical ventilation, and half (n = 73, 54%) were on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Mycological analysis included 2,815 mycological tests (culture, galactomannan, ß-glucan, and PCR) performed on 475 respiratory samples and 532 sera. A probable/putative invasive pulmonary mold infection was diagnosed in 7 (4.8%) patients and linked to high mortality. Multivariate analysis indicates a significantly higher risk for solid organ transplant recipients (odds ratio, = 4.66; interquartile range, 1.98-7.34; P = 0.004).

Additionally, the current COVID-19 pandemic has placed substantial limitations on surgical training worldwide. Contact free, remote, web-based, validated learning tools which are easily accessible and allows repeated, sustained practice are the need of the hour. Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) have been used extensively to train pilots and military personnel and has shown excellent early results within orthopaedic training. We designed a femoral nailing CTA tool which showed objective benefits in the enhancement of cognitive knowledge in medical students. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this CTA tool to enhance practical skills in orthopaedic trainees in a real time interactive simulation setting (Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS)). METHODS: This was a double blinded, randomized controlled trial. 14 junior orthopaedic residents who met the inclusion criteria were recruited in the study. They were randomized into two equal groups. The intervention group were given the CTA learning tool, the control group were given a standard operative technique manual used for antegrade femoral intramedullary nailing. The participants were assessed on a high-fidelity phantom femur model with actual femoral nailing instruments in a simulation mobile operating theatre where the candidate had a simulation patient, an acting anesthetist and a scrub nurse (DIS). They were assessed using the modified Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) rating scale which has been validated for orthopaedic trauma. RESULTS: The median OSATS score in the intervention group was 49 (±4.93, range 39-55) compared to 17 in the control group (±14.98, range 12-51). The median improvement was by 32 points (p = 0.02). The ICC between the two raters was 0.977. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated objective benefits of a novel femoral nailing CTA tool in the enhancement of practical skills for junior trainees in the DIS setting. This adds to the growing evidence supporting the use of CTA in orthopaedic training. This tool can be accessed remotely, is contact free and allows repeated sustained practice which is key in simulation training.","Bhattacharyya, Rahul; Al-Obaidi, Bilal; Sugand, Kapil; Bhattacharya, Rajarshi; Gupte, Chinmay M",Injury,,164

Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) widely expressing in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells has been identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Dysfunction of ACE2 leads to abnormal activation of the renin-angiotensin system and a systemic endotheliitis that may relate to abnormal coagulation and sepsis. Meanwhile, innate immune response and inflammation activation participate in dysfunctional coagulation. Previous research indicated that dysfunctional coagulation was one of the important risk factors accountable for a high risk of severe disease and death in patients with COVID-19. Understanding the possible mechanisms of dysfunctional coagulation and appropriate anticoagulation therapeutic strategies are important to prevent disease deterioration and reduce fatality rates during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, Jie; Saguner, Ardan M; An, Jiaqi; Ning, Yuye; Yan, Yang; Li, Guoliang",Adv Ther,,164

Previous research has demonstrated the passage of time becomes distorted for many people during these lockdowns. To date, research has only examined how time was experienced early in initial lockdowns. The current study examined whether distortions to the passage of time were also present later into the global pandemic. An online questionnaire was used to collect passage of time judgments for the day, week and 8 month period since the first UK lockdown. In addition, measures of affect, social satisfaction, task-load, compliance and health status were also recorded. The results show that over 80% of people reported experiencing distortion to the passage of time during the second English lockdown in comparison with normal. Depression, satisfaction with social interaction and shielding status were found to be significant predictors of temporal distortion. A slower passage of time was associated with greater depression, shielding and greater dissatisfaction with social interactions. Feeling like it was longer than 8 months since the UK's first lockdown was associated with greater depression, increased dissatisfaction with social interaction and greater change of life as a result of lockdown. The results suggest that distortions to the passage of time are an enduring feature of lockdown life and that different factors predict temporal experience during different points in lockdown.","Ogden, Ruth",PLoS One,,164

428137,Pflege Markt,2020,"Purpose One of the major negative effects of the Coronavirus outbreak worldwide has been reduced investment in green energy projects and energy efficiency. The main purpose of this paper is to study the role of green bond proposed by the World Bank in 2008, as a reliable instrument to enhance the capital flow in energy efficiency financing and to develop green energy resources during and post the current challenging global time. Design/methodology/approach We model energy efficiency for 37 members of OECD through a panel data framework and quarterly data over 2007Q1-2020Q4. Findings The major results reveal the positive impacts of issued green bonds and regulatory quality index on energy efficiency, while any increase in inflation rate and urbanization decelerates the progress of raising energy efficiency. Practical implications As highlighted concluding remarks and policy implications, it can be expressed that the tool of green bond is a potential policy to drive-up energy efficiency financing and enhancing environmental quality during and post-COVID period. It is recommended to follow green bond policy with an efficient regulation framework and urbanization saving energy planning. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, although a few scholars have investigated the impacts of COVID-19 on green financing or examined the energy efficiency financing, the matter of modeling energy efficiency-green bond relationship has not been addressed by any academic study. The contributions of this paper to the existing literature are: (1) it is the first academic study to discover the relationship between energy efficiency and green bond in OECD countries, (2) since our empirical part provides estimation results based on quarterly data covering the year of 2019 and 2020, it may offer some new policy implications to enhance energy efficiency financing in and post-COVID period, (3) furthermore, we consider energy efficiency indicator (mix of industrial, residential, services and transport energy efficiency) as the dependent variable instead of using the simple energy intensity variable as a proxy for energy efficiency.","Tu, C.

429173,Don't let COVID stop your fieldwork: three tips for successful collaborations,2020,"PURPOSE: Little is known about the views of U.S. youth on COVID-19 or their use of face coverings. Closing this gap could facilitate messaging to promote COVID-19 risk mitigation behaviors. METHODS: In July 2020, a five-question text message survey was sent to 1,087 youth aged 14-24 years. Questions assessed youths' perceptions regarding the likelihood of contracting COVID-19, the potential impact of contracting COVID-19 on their lives, the possibility of spreading COVID-19 to others, and their use of face coverings around others with whom they do not live. Coding was conducted to assign responses to discrete categories and to identify common themes. RESULTS: Of 1,087 eligible participants, 797 (73.3%) were included in analyses. Of these participants, 27.3% believed they would likely contract COVID-19 in the next few months, 90.3% believed contracting COVID-19 would have a moderate or significant impact on their lives, 86.0% were moderately or very concerned about spreading COVID-19, and 89.2% reported wearing face coverings all or most of the time. Factors affecting face covering use included the desire to avoid contracting and spreading COVID-19, peer influence, and policy mandates. CONCLUSIONS: Youths' perceptions regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 varied, but most believed their lives would be adversely impacted if this occurred. Most youth were concerned about spreading COVID-19 and wore face coverings, but many made exceptions to face covering use when around close contacts. Public health campaigns may be most effective if they leverage positive peer influence and appeal to youths' desire not to spread COVID-19 to others.","DeJonckheere, Melissa; Waselewski, Marika; Amaro, Xochitl; Frank, Abby; Chua, Kao-Ping",J Adolesc Health,,164

Regional resilience is a place-sensitive, multi-layered and multi-scalar, conflict-ridden and highly contingent process. The nature of shocks is one important impact factor on regional resilience. Arguably, so far, most literature on regional resilience has dealt with the financial crisis in 2008/2009. In this research note, we will analyse both the particular characteristics of the current COVID-19 crisis, as well as its effects on regional recovery and potential resilience in China, where it started. We conclude that a complex combination of the characteristics of the current COVID-19 crisis, the institutional experience of dealing with previous pandemic and epidemic crises, government support schemes, as well as regional industrial structures, might potentially affect the recovery and resilience rates of Chinese regions.","Gong, Huiwen; Hassink, Robert; Tan, Juntao; Huang, Dacang",Tijdschrift voor economische en sociale geografie,,164

We sought to determine if patients with implantable defibrillators residing in areas with high COVID-19 activity experienced an increase in defibrillator shocks during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods and Results Using the Medtronic (Mounds View, MN) Carelink database from 2019 and 2020, we retrospectively determined the incidence of implantable defibrillator shock episodes among patients residing in New York City, New Orleans, LA, and Boston, MA. A total of 14 665 patients with a Medtronic implantable defibrillator (age, 66±13 years; and 72% men) were included in the analysis. Comparing analysis time periods coinciding with the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 with the same periods in 2019, we observed a larger mean rate of defibrillator shock episodes per 1000 patients in New York City (17.8 versus 11.7, respectively), New Orleans (26.4 versus 13.5, respectively), and Boston (30.9 versus 20.6, respectively) during the COVID-19 surge. Age- and sex-adjusted hurdle model showed that the Poisson distribution rate of defibrillator shocks for patients with &#8805;1 shock was 3.11 times larger (95% CI, 1.08-8.99; P=0.036) in New York City, 3.74 times larger (95% CI, 0.88-15.89; P=0.074) in New Orleans, and 1.97 times larger (95% CI, 0.69-5.61; P=0.202) in Boston in 2020 versus 2019. However, the binomial odds of any given patient having a shock episode was not different in 2020 versus 2019. Conclusions Defibrillator shock episodes increased during the higher COVID-19 activity in New York City, New Orleans, and Boston. These observations may provide insights into COVID-19-related increase in cardiac arrests.","Adabag, Selçuk; Zimmerman, Patrick; Black, Adam; Madjid, Mohammad; Safavi-Naeini, Payam; Cheng, Alan",J Am Heart Assoc,,164

We analyse the size and structure of contagion to verify how different events spread contagion across borders and sectors. We applied the methodology proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz, 2009, Diebold and Yilmaz, 2012, Diebold and Yilmaz, 2014 to a wide range of stock market indices using a quantile regression framework. Our findings show that the sectoral and country-specific indices usually range below the overall market contagion levels, while their density functions differ structurally from those of overall market contagion. Among non-economic events, viruses – notably, the COVID-19 pandemic – are the most widespread sources of contagion, while terrorism events affect the widest range of sectors with the greatest magnitude. Among economic events, the strongest negative impact is found for prudential ones. Quantitative easing (QE) and liquidity support reduce overall market contagion, while QE unwinding has a more substantial role than its introduction or expansion, exemplifying its asymmetric impact. We also investigate how investors may benefit from using contagion information in developing trading strategies, highlighting the positive impact of spillover-based weightings on portfolio returns.","Iwanicz-Drozdowska, Małgorzata Rogowicz Karol Kurowski Łukasz Smaga Paweł",Journal of Financial Stability,,164

METHODS: Commercial serological tests from 11 suppliers were assayed side-by-side using 126 samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected inpatients and 36 from healthy and HIV-infected individuals. RESULTS: The majority of the tests assayed have >95% specificity. For the sensitivity calculation, samples were stratified by days since symptoms onset; sensitivity peaks at 16-21 days for IgM and IgA (maximum 91.2%, Euroimmun) and, dependant on the test, at 16-21 or >21 days for IgG (maximum 94.1%, Snibe). Data from semiquantitative tests show that patients with a severe clinical presentation have lower levels of Ig targeting SARS-CoV-2 at <10 days since symptoms onset and higher levels at >21 days, compared to patients with a non-severe presentation. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the heterogeneity of sensitivity and generally high specificity of the serological tests and establishes a basis for their usefulness to complement diagnostic techniques and population seroprevalence studies.","Serre-Miranda, C; Nobrega, C; Roque, S; Canto-Gomes, J; Silva, C S; Vieira, N; Barreira-Silva, P; Alves-Peixoto, P; Cotter, J; Reis, A; Formigo, M; Sarmento, H; Pires, O; Carvalho, A; Petrovykh, D Y; Diéguez, L; Sousa, J C; Sousa, N; Capela, C; Palha, J A; Cunha, P G; Correia-Neves, M",Int J Infect Dis,,164

438279,News at a glance,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic escalated in early 2020, Indonesia suspended all activities in school. Approximately 45 million students in Indonesia were unable to attend schools, including early childhood students. As a result, the Indonesian government encourages learning activities to be carried out online or remotely. This study aims to develop a framework that can be used in online learning for early childhood in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic. The methodology used is a literature study on online learning in early childhood, which includes literature review and empirical research. Online learning in Indonesia is faced with various challenges, such as the disparity in the quality of education in Java and outside Java, uneven internet access, and lack of ICT skills raise concerns over the quality of online learning being implemented across the nation. From the perspective of early childhood education, online learning is relatively new. There are only a few research studies that identify effective practices for online learning for early childhood. It can also be challenging for teachers who new to online learning to choose what strategies work best or where to start. Moreover, there is a heated debate about whether online learning is appropriate for early childhood. Despite all these limitations and debates, this study proposes a framework in online learning which focuses more on the pedagogical aspects rather than the technological aspects.","Istiana, Yuyun; id,",JCE (Journal Of Childhood Education),,164

440627,Will a covid vaccine be accepted?,2021,"Background: The vascular burden increased by COVID-19 infection and including acute limb ischemia (ALI) quickly emerged as a major medical challenge with devastating consequences such as limb loss, multiorgan dysfunction and death. We report a case series of COVID-19 infection associated with ALI to raise awareness and knowledge towards this life-threatening association. Methods: COVIDS-19 patients with acute limb ischemia (ALI) managed in a Moroccan 14 beds COVID-19 ICU between March 2020 and January 2021, were reviewed. Data collected included demographics, clinical presentation, treatments and outcomes. Results: Over the 10-month period, our ICU cared for 407 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. A total of 6 COVID-19 patients with ALI were identified. The mean age was 61 years (52 - 70) and 5 were men. The most common preexisting condition was diabetes (50%). The mean CRP level was 219 mg/L. Five patients had thrombus in multiple locations. No concomitant deep vein thrombosis was identified. Four patients presented with signs of acute arterial ischemia with or without respiratory symptoms and were subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19. The remaining two patients developed ischemia during hospitalization. Mean SOFA score was 5 (2 - 9). Respiratory support, corticosteroids and heparin therapies were used in all patients. Intubation and vasopressors were required in four patients. Revascularization was performed in five patients and reintervention was necessary in three cases. Four patients died in the ICU while two were successfully discharged. Conclusion: ALI in COVID-19 patients is a challenging life-threatening vascular emergency that requires appropriate multidisciplinary management (intensivists, anesthesiologists, vascular surgeons and interventionists, radiologists, haematologists.) and further studies focused on anticoagulation.","Touzani, S.; Haddari, F.

However, as remarkable as the Chinese strategy might be, it cannot be replicated in other countries and certainly not in Europe. In Europe, there is a distribution of power between the European Union and its member states. In contrast, China's political power is concentrated in the central government. This enables it to take immediate measures that affect the entire country, such as massive quarantines or closing borders. Moreover, the Chinese legal framework includes restrictions on privacy and other human rights that are unknown in Europe. In addition, China has the technological power to easily impose such restrictions. In most European countries, that would be science fiction. These conditions have enabled China to combat epidemics like no other country can. However, the WHO might have been overoptimistic. The Chinese standard of care for treating COVID-19 also raises problematic issues for human rights, and the real consequences of these actions remain to be seen.","Raposo, Vera Lucia",J Med Ethics,,164

447962,Daily briefing: Inside India's catastrophic COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"A new coronavirus-strain from a zoonotic reservoir (probably bat)-termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-has recently claimed more than two million deaths worldwide. Consequently, a burst of scientific reports on epidemiology, symptoms, and diagnosis came out. However, a comprehensive understanding of eco-environmental aspects that may contribute to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread is still missing, and we therefore aim to focus here on these aspects. In addition to human-human direct SARS-CoV-2 transmission, eco-environmental sources, such as air aerosols, different public use objects, hospital wastes, livestock/pet animals, municipal wastes, ventilation facilities, soil and groundwater potentially contribute to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Further, high temperature and humidity were found to limit the spread of COVID-19. Although the COVID-19 pandemic led to decrease air and noise pollution during the period of lockdown, increased use of masks and gloves is threatening the environment by water and soil pollutions. COVID-19 badly impacted all the socio-economic groups in different capacities, where women, slum dwellers, and the people lacking social protections are the most vulnerable. Finally, sustainable strategies, waste management, biodiversity reclaim, eco-friendly lifestyle, improved health infrastructure and public awareness, were proposed to minimize the COVID-19 impact on our society and environment. These strategies will seemingly be equally effective against any future outbreak.","Nazir, Rashid; Ali, Jawad; Rasul, Ijaz; Widemann, Emilie; Shafiq, Sarfraz",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,164

However, whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can affect multiple organs is still unclear. In this study, postmortem percutaneous biopsies of multiple organs from deceased patients were performed to understand the histopathological changes caused by COVID-19. METHODS: Biopsy specimens of pulmonary, cardiac, hepatic and lymphoid tissues were obtained from three patients, who died due to COVID-19 pneumonia. H&E stain, Masson trichrome stain, immunohistochemistry stain and in-situ hybridisation were used. RESULTS: Pulmonary damages caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). In the early phase, the histological findings were mainly those of exudative features of DAD. The later phase was characterised by organisation of DAD combined with bacterial pneumonia. No serious damage was found in the bronchiolar epithelium and submucosal glands. The hepatic tissue revealed features of ischaemic necrosis, but findings suggestive of mild lobular hepatitis were also observed. The lymphoid tissue revealed features of non-specific acute lymphadenitis. The cardiac tissue revealed changes of underlying disease. SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were not detected in hepatocytes, cholangiocytes and lymphocytes of lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 predominantly involves the pulmonary tissue, causes DAD and aggravates the cardiovascular disease. However, other extrapulmonary tissues did not reveal any virus-specific findings, but were affected by multiple factors. The findings in this report caution the pathologists that they should not mistakenly attribute all the histological features to CoV infection. Moreover, the clinicians should pay attention to the potentially injurious and correctable causes.","Wang, Xin-Xin; Shao, Chen; Huang, Xiao-Jie; Sun, Lin; Meng, Ling-Jia; Liu, Hui; Zhang, Shi-Jie; Li, Hong-Jun; Lv, Fu-Dong",J. clin. pathol,,164

453493,"Variational multi-task MRI reconstruction: Joint reconstruction, registration and super-resolution",2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Viruses exist in complex microbial environments, and recent studies have revealed both synergistic and antagonistic effects of specific bacterial taxa on viral prevalence and infectivity. We set out to test whether specific bacterial communities predict SARS-CoV-2 occurrence in a hospital setting. METHODS: We collected 972 samples from hospitalized patients with COVID-19, their health care providers, and hospital surfaces before, during, and after admission. We screened for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR, characterized microbial communities using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and used these bacterial profiles to classify SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection with a random forest model. RESULTS: Sixteen percent of surfaces from COVID-19 patient rooms had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA, although infectivity was not assessed. The highest prevalence was in floor samples next to patient beds (39%) and directly outside their rooms (29%). Although bed rail samples more closely resembled the patient microbiome compared to floor samples, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected less often in bed rail samples (11%). SARS-CoV-2 positive samples had higher bacterial phylogenetic diversity in both human and surface samples and higher biomass in floor samples. 16S microbial community profiles enabled high classifier accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 status in not only nares, but also forehead, stool, and floor samples. Across these distinct microbial profiles, a single amplicon sequence variant from the genus Rothia strongly predicted SARS-CoV-2 presence across sample types, with greater prevalence in positive surface and human samples, even when compared to samples from patients in other intensive care units prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: These results contextualize the vast diversity of microbial niches where SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected and identify specific bacterial taxa that associate with the viral RNA prevalence both in the host and hospital environment.

It is well recognised that district nursing services have no limits to their capacity, and they have been dealing with an increasing caseload, with no increases in resources or staff. Consequently, this has left community nurses feeling exhausted and experiencing burnout, which, in the long term, can lead to compassion fatigue, which can in turn compromise patient safety. Specialist practitioner qualified district nurses (SPQDN) require the skills and knowledge to promote health and wellbeing, in order to provide a positive work environment and limit work-related stress and burnout despite the challenges encountered. This article explores possible strategies to promote health and wellbeing among community nurses and the barriers that SPQDNs encounter in doing so.","Rogers, Amy",Br J Community Nurs,,164

It was labelled a pandemic by World Health Organization. Although it commonly produces respiratory symptoms, neurological features have been described. Neurological manifestations may vary from non-specific symptoms such as headache, dizziness, myalgia and/or fatigue, olfactory or taste dysfunction to specific syndromes including meningitis, stroke, acute transverse myelitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome. This review describes potential pathogenetic mechanisms and neurological manifestations of COVID-19 along with its management. Considering structural and pathogenetic similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and MERS viruses, we compared their neurological manifestations and mentioned few features expected in COVID-19 in future. Interestingly, many COVID-19 cases may present with pure neurological manifestations at onset with non-neurological features manifesting few days later and we propose the term ""Neuro-COVID syndrome"" for such cases. Awareness of neurological manifestations may facilitate its management and improve outcome in such patients.","Desai, Ishita; Manchanda, Rajat; Kumar, Niraj; Tiwari, Ashutosh; Kumar, Mritunjai",Neurol Sci,,164

Adhesively bonded composite-epoxy single-lap joints have been investigated with advanced ultrasonic nondestructive testing and induction thermography. Bonded structures with artificial debonding defects in three different case studies have been investigated: debonding with release film inclusion, debonding with brass film-large, debonding with brass film-small. After completing preprocessing of the data for data fusion, the feature matrices, depending on the interface reflection peak-to-peak amplitude and the principal component analysis, have been extracted from ultrasonic and thermography inspection results, respectively. The obtained feature matrices have been used as the source in basic (average, difference, weighted average, Hadamard product) and statistical (Dempster-Shafer rule of combination) data fusion algorithms. The defect detection performances of advanced nondestructive testing techniques, in addition to data fusion algorithms have been evaluated quantitatively by receiver operating characteristics. In conclusion, it is shown that data fusion can increase the detectability of artificial debonding in single-lap joints.","Yilmaz, Bengisu; Ba, Abdoulaye; Jasiuniene, Elena; Bui, Huu-Kien; Berthiau, Gérard",,,164

472149,When Movies Get Sick,2021,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to quantify the motion dynamics of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: Three physical models of Newton's and Stokes's laws with(out) air resistance in the calm air are used to determine the falling time and velocity regimes of SARS-CoV-2 with(out) a respiratory water droplet of 1 to 2000 micrometers (µm) in diameter of an infected person of 0.5 to 2.6 m in height. Results: The horizontal distance travelled by SARS-CoV-2 in free fall from 1.7 m was 0.88 m due to breathing or talking and 2.94 m due to sneezing or coughing. According to Newton's laws of motion with air resistance, its falling velocity and time from 1.7 m were estimated at 3.95 × 10-2 m s-1 and 43 s, respectively. Large droplets > 100 µm reached the ground from 1.7 m in less than 1.6 s, while the droplets &#8805; 30 µm fell within 4.42 s regardless of the human height. Based on Stokes's law, the falling time of the droplets encapsulating SARS-CoV-2 ranged from 4.26 × 10-3 to 8.83 × 104 s as a function of the droplet size and height. Conclusion: The spread dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic is closely coupled to the falling dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 for which Newton's and Stokes's laws appeared to be applicable mostly to the respiratory droplet size &#8805; 237.5 µm and &#8804; 237.5 µm, respectively. An approach still remains to be desired so as to better quantify the motion of the nano-scale objects.","Aydin, Mehmet; Evrendilek, Fatih; Savas, Seckin Aydin; Aydin, Ismail Erkan; Evrendilek, Deniz Eren",J Med Biol Eng,,164
472177,A note from the editor,2020,"BACKGROUND: Faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to triage symptomatic primary care patients for further investigation of colorectal cancer. AIM: To ascertain the diagnostic performance of FIT in symptomatic adult primary care patients. METHODS: Faecal samples from routine primary care practice in Oxfordshire, UK were analysed using the HM-JACKarc FIT method between March 2017 and March 2020. Clinical details were recorded. Patients were followed up for up to 36 months in linked hospital records for evidence of benign and serious (colorectal cancer, high-risk adenomas and bowel inflammation) colorectal disease. The diagnostic accuracy of FIT is reported by gender, age group and FIT threshold. RESULTS: In 9896 adult patients with at least 6-month follow-up, a FIT result &#8805;10 µg Hb/g faeces had a sensitivity for colorectal cancer of 90.5% (95% CI 84.9%-96.1%), specificity 91.3% (90.8%-91.9%), positive predictive value (PPV) 10.1% (8.15%-12.0%) and negative predictive value (NPV) 99.9% (99.8%-100.0%). The PPV and specificity for serious colorectal disease were higher and the sensitivity and NPV lower than for colorectal cancer alone. The area under the curve for all adults did not change substantially by gender or by increasing the minimum age of testing. Using &#8805;10 µg Hb/g faeces, 10% of adults would be investigated to detect 91% of cancers, a number needed to scope of ten to detect one cancer. Using &#8805;7, &#8805;50 and &#8805;150 µg Hb/g faeces, 11%, 4% and 3% of adults would be investigated, and 91%, 74% and 54% cancers detected, respectively. CONCLUSION: A FIT threshold of &#8805;10 µg Hb/g faeces would be appropriate to triage adult patients presenting to primary care with symptoms of serious colorectal disease. FIT may be used to reprioritise patients referred with colorectal cancer symptoms whose investigations have been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nicholson, Brian D; James, Tim; Paddon, Maria; Justice, Steve; Oke, Jason L; East, James E; Shine, Brian",Aliment. pharmacol. ther,,164

Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n = 215) treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from January 24 to March 12, 2020, were included in the study and classified into severe and non-severe groups. Peripheral immunocyte count and cytokine statuses were compared. The correlation between immune status, cytokine levels, and disease severity was analyzed. Leukocyte numbers were normal in both groups; however, they were relatively high (7.19 × 109/L) in patients of the severe group. Leukocyte distributions differed between the two groups; the severe group had a higher percentage of neutrophils and lower percentage of lymphocytes compared with the non-severe group, and absolute lymphocyte numbers were below normal in both groups, and particularly deficient in patients in the severe group. Lymphocyte counts have negative correlation with duration of hospital period whereas neutrophil count has no significant correlation with it. Of tested cytokines, IL-6 levels were significantly higher in the severe group (P = 0.0418). Low level of lymphocyte predicts severity of COVID-19. IL-6 levels were significantly higher in the severe group, especially in some extremely severe patients. But we did not detect the significant correlation between severity of COVID-19 with IL-6 level which may be due to limited case numbers. Our observations encourage future research to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms and to improve treatment outcome of COVID-19.","Li, Xiaolei; Liu, Yang; Li, Junming; Sun, Longhua; Yang, Jibin; Xu, Fei; Zhou, Jing; Wan, Lagen; Xu, Xinping; Le, Aiping; Zhang, Wei",Immunol Res,,164

METHODS: In March 2020, Leipzig University Hospital established an outpatient clinic for patients potentially infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Confirmed cases with mild to moderate symptoms self-isolated at home and were followed-up by daily telephone calls for at least 14 days. Symptoms and course of illness of these patients are reported here. RESULTS: From March 20 to April 17, 2020, 1460 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by naso- or oropharyngeal swab for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Covid-19 was confirmed in 91 (6.2%) patients, of which 87 were included in the final analysis. Patients presented for testing after a mean of 5.9 days (IQR = 2.0-8.5). The median age was 37.0 years (IQR = 28.5-53), and 48 (55.2%) were female. Five (5.7%) patients required hospital admission during the course of illness. Most frequently reported symptoms were fatigue (n = 64, 74%), cough (n = 58, 67%), and hyposmia/hypogeusia (n = 44, 51%). In contrast to previous reports, fever occurred in less than a third of patients (n = 25, 29%). By day 14, more than half of the patients had recovered completely (n = 37/70, 52.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Fever seems to be less common in patients of relatively young age diagnosed with mild to moderate Covid-19. This suggests that body temperature alone may be an insufficient indicator of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Schneider, Anne; Kirsten, Holger; Lordick, Franziska; Lordick, Florian; Lübbert, Christoph; von Braun, Amrei",PLoS One,,164

Global research on COVID-19 went 'viral' with a record 3487 research contributions comprising of 2062 journal papers and 1425 preprints published within the first three months following the outbreak of COVID-19. Surprisingly, the silence of the African research community has been unprecedented - contributing a paltry 0.6% (22 contributions), a figure nearly matched by Colombia (18 publications). Until now, a comprehensive perspective on the reasons for this subdued research response, and COVID-19 themes critical to Africa has been missing. We posit that while a milieu of factors accounts for this silence, unprecedented research opportunities exist to support COVID-19 decision and policy formulation in Africa. The subdued response reflects weak research systems, characterized by deep-rooted challenges, including severe lack of research expertise, funding, and infrastructure, coupled with poor working conditions. Hence, Africa's contribution to research on infectious diseases, including COVID-19, remains weak. Perceptions and attitudes among researchers and policy-makers on COVID-19, and the role of science in decision and policy-making also exist. Moreover, COVID-19 and earlier severe acute respiratory syndromes are considered as 'imported diseases' originating from outside Africa. Thus, notions may exist that the control methods will come from outside Africa through 'technology-transfer' or 'capacity-building'. Yet local COVID-19 research is needed to address knowledge gaps, including; (1) potential novel transmission of SARS-CoV-2, (2) adaption of generic COVID-19 control measures to suit African settings, (3) occurrence and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in solid waste, wastewaters, on-site sanitation systems, and drinking water, and (4) the 'human factor' including the role of gender, perceptions, myths, attitudes, and religious beliefs in the transmission and control of COVID-19. Therefore, there is a need to: (1) strengthen local research capacity and evaluation systems, (2) consider biosafety and ethical issues, (3) initiate cross-disciplinary research and global collaboration on COVID-19, and (4) integrate science communication in COVID-19 programs.","Gwenzi, Willis; Rzymski, Piotr",Environ Res,,164

483366,The lockdowns worked-but what comes next?,2020,"It is regrettable that in recent years, the Korean Medical Association (KMA) has held special meetings of the house of delegates almost annually, purely for the removal of the president of the KMA from his/her office. There could be several reasons for this, but the failure of communication caused by the fragmentation of the KMA's governance structure may be a major contributing factor. It may therefore be helpful to benchmark the governance of other professional organizations like the British Medical Association (BMA) to identify differences in the practice of consensus building, which leads to policy making. Due to the unexpected COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak, this study was limited to internet resources. It was impossible for the author to conduct participant observation or direct face-to-face interviews to get essential information about the governance of the BMA. Nevertheless, the findings provide valuable lessons for the KMA. There seem to be chasms among the house of delegates, the regional association and the board of directors in the KMA; better integration among major bodies within the KMA is required. Furthemore, the time spent by these bodies on generating policies and strategies is not sufficient. The BMA is a union with its professional activities secured by labor laws, whereas major players of the KMA do not have a protected time for their professional trade association. The KMA needs to remodel the current governance which is characterized by inadequate communication and subsequent fragmentation among the acting bodies of the Association. Continuous professional development for the leaders and members of the KMA might enable this change in governance.","Ahn, Ducksun",J. Kor. Med. Assoc.,,164

Phone interview surveys were conducted by trained enumerators across 12 states and 200 districts in India from 3 to 15 May 2020. A total of 1437 farmers completed the survey (94% male; 28% 30-39 years old; 38% with secondary schooling). About one in ten farmers (11%) did not harvest in the past month with primary reasons cited being unfavorable weather (37%) and lockdown-related reasons (24%). A total of 63% of farmers harvested in the past month (primarily wheat and vegetables), but only 44% had sold their crop; 12% were still trying to sell their crop, and 39% had stored their crop, with more than half (55%) reporting lockdown-related issues as the reason for storing. Seventy-nine percent of households with wage-workers witnessed a decline in wages in the past month and 49% of households with incomes from livestock witnessed a decline. Landless farmers were about 10 times more likely to skip a meal as compared to large farmers (18% versus 2%), but a majority reported receiving extra food rations from the government. Nearly all farmers reported consuming staple grains daily in the past week (97%), 63% consumed dairy daily, 40% vegetables daily, 26% pulses daily, and 7% fruit daily. These values are much lower than reported previously for farmers in India around this time of year before COVID-19: 94-95% dairy daily, 57-58% pulses daily, 64-65% vegetables daily, and 42-43% fruit daily. In conclusion, we found that the COVID-19 lockdown in India has primarily impacted farmers' ability to sell their crops and livestock products and decreased daily wages and dietary diversity.

It is necessary to fully understand the occupational risks of health workers to protect them and reduce their risk of infection. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to obtain comprehensive and detailed information on occupational risk factors of infectious diseases for HWs in different dimensions and to propose control strategies for three risk dimensions to protect HWs who are at high risk of infection during the pandemic. METHODS: A total number of 619 articles published from 2010 to 2021 were searched to conduct bibliometric analysis, which were retrieved in the Web of Science database with defined search terms. There were 26 articles met the criteria, and they were screened to identify occupational risk factors. RESULTS: We conducted an analysis of cited institutions, co-citation network analysis of journals, and references from bibliometric analysis. Nine risk factors were extracted, and they were classified and sorted into three dimensions. Infection control strategies for each dimension were proposed. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of infection faced by HWs is unprecedented. Medical institutions should pay more attention to the nine risk factors that we identified and use the three risk dimensions to carry out risk identification and infection control to reduce the infection risk of HWs and protect them better.","Jin, Haizhe; Chen, Yuxiao; Fu, Quanwei; Qu, Qingxing",Work,,164
486038,How an Australian researcher ended up in the spotlight at a White House coronavirus briefing ;Science ;AAAS,2020,"By combining a historical institutionalism approach with institutional isomorphism and punctuated equilibrium, this paper analyses quarantine policy change across 120 years of Australian quarantine history. By anchoring our analysis within specific time periods (years before the Spanish flu, seven decades of inaction, and multiple post-1997 pandemic updates and responses), we highlight when and why policies did or did not change and how constant push-and-pulls between State and Commonwealth institutional ownership altered policy possibilities. The heart of our analysis showcases how Australia's successful COVID-19 response is a unique output of prior quarantine policies, institutional evolution, and mid-pandemic alterations of key national pandemic response plans.

487109,Delayed Rebounds in the Two-Ball Bounce Problem,2020-07-29,"BACKGROUND: Accurate and rapid testing for SARS-COV-2 antibodies could improve the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. In this study, we aim to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a commercially available point-of-care lateral flow kit independently and in comparison to an established platform-based system. METHOD: Samples from 144 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 130 pre-pandemic negative controls were tested in parallel by MP Rapid 2019-NCOV IgM/IgG Combo test and Roche Elecsys. Comparison of results based on serum and capillary blood testing was undertaken. RESULTS: Sensitivity at day 15 onwards was 100% for both methods. Between days 1 and 7 post admission, the IgM/IgG Combo test and Roche Elecsys shown sensitivity of 74% (95%CI: 62%-85%) vs. 67% (95% CI: 55%-79%, P = 0.3947). Combo test specificities were 100% for IgG, 98.5% for IgM vs. Roche Elecsys specificity of 100%. Concordance analysis showed 98.5% agreement to the Roche Elecsys method (Cohen's Kappa 0.96 95% CI [0.92-0.99]). Capillary blood results showed complete agreement with serum samples using the Combo test. CONCLUSION: In comparison to Roche Elecsys, our data show that the MP Rapid 2019-NCOV IgM/IgG Combo test provides a high-confidence assay system for the detection of previous exposure to SARS-COV-2 infection with advantage of affording near-patient testing.","Jassam, N; Barth, J H; Allgar, V; Glover, S; Stevenson, F; Lauber, N; Houghton, V; Hanif, Z; Child, J; Clark, B",Ann Clin Biochem,,164
487901,Epidemiological profiles and associated risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients based on a high-throughput testing facility in India,2021,"BACKGROUND: With the magnitude and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the usual face-to-face consultation within a clinical setting is no longer feasible. Thus, this led to the need for alternate means to provide adequate patient care for surgical patients. This is where the role of smartphones comes into play, in which it is thus of paramount importance. This research study aimed to assess the usefulness of smartphones in surgical practice during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study is based on a questionnaire distributed among surgeons in different levels of practice working at Kuwait governmental hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire was developed via Google Docs to collect data for the current study. RESULTS: Out of 600 surgeons, 180 have responded to the questionnaire, giving a response rate of 30%. Of these, 42.8%, 85.5%, and 58.9% were aged between 35 and 44 years, were male, and Kuwaiti nationals, respectively. Almost all of the respondents (99.5%) were using smartphones for hospital-related work. The most common uses of the smartphones involved texting (70%), and viewing or taking images and videos using built-in cameras (60%) either in the emergency department, outpatient clinics, wards, or operating rooms. The majority of the respondents (88%) rated the use of smartphones in practice as important. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that using smartphones in surgical practice was prevalent among the respondent surgeons in Kuwait during the pandemic. The majority of them considered using smartphones in practice to be important, due to its benefits in facilitating doctor-doctor and patient-doctor communication, reviewing the literature, and making clinical decisions. Guidelines are required for proper and legal use of smartphone devices in medical practice. Accordingly, recommendations are suggested.","Buabbas, Ali Jasem; Aldousari, Saad; Ayed, Adel K; Safar, Maryam; Alkandari, Omar",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,,164
488189,"Calling all coronavirus researchers: keep sharing, stay open",2020,"BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) of primary cutaneous melanoma as an important staging method has not been popularly undertaken in Korea and only a few studies with small patient numbers have been published. AIM: We examined the clinical feasibility and overall outcomes of SLNB in acral melanoma (AM) of Korean in Kyungpook National University Hospital (KNUH) over the past 13 years. METHODS: SLNB in AM patients during 2006-2018 were analyzed retrospectively for sentinel lymph node (SLN) harvesting rate, positivity rate, positivity-relevant overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), and its side effects. RESULTS: A total of 109 AM patients who underwent SLNB were enrolled. Harvested nodes were identified from 107 patients and SLN harvesting rate was 98.2%. The mean Breslow thickness (±standard deviation) was 3.38 ± 3.03 mm, and the proportion of ulcerated melanomas was 64%. Twenty-two (20.6%) had a tumor-positive SLN and, among them, 82% (18/22) underwent immediate complete lymph node dissection (CLND). The metastasis-positive nodal basin after CLND was detected in 16.7% of cases (3/18). Tumor-negative SLN cohorts showed significantly better OS and DFS than tumor-positive ones (P = 0.006 and P < 0.001 for each). Two side effects, one seroma and one lymphocele, were observed without major sequelae. CONCLUSION: SLNB, crucial management of melanoma, proved its efficacy to predict patients' prognosis and could be performed successfully and safely in Korean AM patients by interdisciplinary cooperation between dermatology and other surgical departments. SLN(-) showed significantly better OS and DFS than SLN(+). Significant risk factors for DFS were Breslow thickness, the presence of ulceration and the presence of SLN metastasis. SLNB should be encouraged in order to stage melanoma accurately and direct the proper management in Korean AM.","Sohng, Chihyeon; Sim, Hyun Bo; Kim, Jun Young; Lim, Yangsoo; Han, Man Hoon; Lee, Hoseok; Ahn, Byeong-Cheol; Huh, Seung; Lee, Seok-Jong",Asia Pac. j. clin.oncol,,164
488383,Is the new UK variant more deadly as well as spreading faster?,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To analyze differences by age group in anxiety, depression, loneliness and comorbid anxiety and depression in young people, middle aged adults and older adults during the lock-down period at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore the association between negative self-perceptions of aging and psychological symptoms controlling by age group. METHOD: Participants are 1501 people (age range 18 to 88 years). Anxiety, sadness, loneliness and self-perceptions of aging were assessed. The sample was divided according to the age group and quartiles (lower, intermediate levels, and higher) of anxiety, sadness, loneliness and self-perceptions of aging. RESULTS: Older adults reported lower levels of anxiety and sadness than middle aged adults, and middle aged adults reported lower levels than younger participants. Middle aged adults reported the lowest loneliness, followed by older adults and younger participants. For each age group, those with more negative self-perceptions of aging reported higher anxiety, sadness and loneliness. More comorbid anxiety and sadness was found in younger adults and less in older adults; more depressed participants in the middle aged group, and more older adults and less younger participants were found in the group with the lowest levels of anxiety and sadness. For all the age groups, participants with high levels of comorbid anxiety and sadness are those who report the highest scores in negative self-perceptions of aging. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults reported lower psychological anxiety, sadness and loneliness than the other age groups. Having negative self-perceptions of aging damage psychological health irrespective of the chronological age.","Losada-Baltar, Andrés; Márquez-González, María; Jiménez-Gonzalo, Lucía; Pedroso-Chaparro, María Del Sequeros; Gallego-Alberto, Laura; Fernandes-Pires, José",Rev Esp Geriatr Gerontol,,164

This study aimed to provide information regarding the impact of the mandatory confinement on the physical activity, eating disorders risk, sleep quality and well-being on a Spanish sample. An online survey that included the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire, the Eating Attitude Test-26, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was administered two days after the state of alarm was stablished in Spain and five days after such measures began to be eased. Out of the 693 people who answered the first questionnaire, 161 completed the second one. These participants spent a total of 48 days locked at home, a period during which a significant worsening in all the variables assessed except for the risk of developing eating disorders, was observed: weight (kg), 67.3 ± 14.8 vs 67.7 ± 15.1, p = 0.012; physical activity (MET minutes per week), 8515.7 ± 10260.0 vs 5053.5 ± 5502.0, p < 0.001; sleep problems (total score), 6.2 ± 3.5 vs 7.2 ± 3.9, p < 0.001; self-perceived well-being (score), 4 (3-4) vs 3 (3-4), p < 0.001. The confinement had a significant differential effect on physically active participants, who experienced a significant decline (p < 0.05) on their physical activity levels, quality of sleep and well-being; whereas physically inactive participants did not experience significant changes. Findings from this longitudinal study indicate that a lockdown period due to COVID-19 had a negative impact on the physical activity levels, sleep quality and well-being in a group of physically active Spanish adults. Public health authorities should be aware that people who usually lead an active lifestyle, might be particularly susceptible to such disruptions.","Martínez-de-Quel, Óscar; Suárez-Iglesias, David; López-Flores, Marcos; Pérez, Carlos Ayán",Appetite,,164
491035,How will vets work with farmers post Covid?,2020,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a global health crisis since it was first identified in December 2019. In addition to fever, cough, headache, and shortness of breath, an intense increase in immune response-based inflammation has been the hallmark of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) virus infection. This narrative review summarizes and critiques pathophysiology of COVID-19 and its plausible effects on drug metabolism and disposition. The release of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukins, tumor necrosis factor &#945;), also known as 'cytokine storm', leads to altered molecular pathophysiology and eventually organ damage in the lung, heart, and liver. The laboratory values for various liver function tests (e.g., alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, albumin) have indicated potential hepatocellular injury in COVID-19 patients. Since the liver is the powerhouse of protein synthesis and the primary site of cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated drug metabolism, even a minor change in the liver function status has the potential to affect the hepatic clearance of xenobiotics. It has now been well established that extreme increases in cytokine levels are common in COVID-19 patients, and previous studies with patients infected with non-SARS-CoV-2 virus have shown that CYP enzymes can be suppressed by an infection-related cytokine increase and inflammation. Alongside the investigational COVID-19 drugs, the patients may also be on therapeutics for comorbidities; especially epidemiological studies have indicated that individuals with hypertension, hyperglycemia, and obesity are more vulnerable to COVID-19 than the average population. This complicates the drug-disease interaction profile of the patients as both the investigational drugs (e.g., remdesivir, dexamethasone) and the agents for comorbidities can be affected by compromised CYP-mediated hepatic metabolism. Overall, it is imperative that healthcare professionals pay attention to the COVID-19 and CYP-driven drug metabolism interactions with the goal to adjust the dose or discontinue the affected drugs as appropriate.","Deb, Subrata; Arrighi, Scott",Eur J Drug Metab Pharmacokinet,,164

491538,"India, Brazil and the human cost of sidelining science",2021,"PURPOSE: Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Radiation Oncology Education Collaborative Study Group (ROECSG) hosted its annual international symposium using a virtual format in May 2020. This report details the experience of hosting a virtual meeting and presents attendee feedback on the platform. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The ROECSG symposium was hosted virtually on May 15, 2020. A postsymposium survey was distributed electronically to assess attendee demographics, participation, and experience. Attendee preference and experience were queried using 3-point and 5-point Likert-type scales, respectively. Symplur LLC was used to generate analytics for the conference hashtag (#ROECSG). RESULTS: The survey was distributed to all 286 registrants, with a response rate of 67% (191 responses). Seventeen nonattendee responses were omitted from this analysis, for a total of 174 included respondents. Eighty-two attendees (47%) were present for the entire symposium. A preference for a virtual symposium was expressed by 78 respondents (45%), whereas 44 (25%) had no preference and 52 (30%) preferred an in-person meeting. A total of 150 respondents (86%) rated the symposium as ""extremely"" well organized. Respondents who had not attended a prior in-person ROECSG symposium were more likely to prefer the virtual format (P = .03). Seventy-eight respondents (45%) reported a preference for the virtual platform for reviewing scholarly work, and 103 (59%) reported a preference for an in-person platform for networking. On the day of the symposium, #ROECSG had 408 tweets and 432,504 impressions. CONCLUSIONS: The 2020 ROECSG symposium was well received and can serve as a framework for future virtual meetings. Although the virtual setting may facilitate sharing research, networking aspects are more limited. Effort is needed to develop hybrid virtual and in-person meetings that meet the needs of participants in both settings.

Experts can't agree,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the fraction of asymptomatic health-care workers (HCWs) in two designated hospitals for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment in Wuhan and explore the factors associated with asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: All HCWs in Wuhan Union Hospital and Wuhan Red Cross Hospital with either positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid or positive antibody test before 18 April 2020 were included. Exposure, epidemiological and demographic information were retrospectively collected by a structured questionnaire. Medical records were also reviewed for clinical characteristics and CT images of HCWs. RESULTS: As of 18 April 2020, a total of 424 HCWs were identified. Among them, 276 (65.1%) were symptomatic and 148 (34.9%) were asymptomatic. Fifty-five (19.9%) families of the symptomatic HCWs and 16 (10.8%) families of the asymptomatic HCWs were infected with SARS-CoV-2. HCWs with infected family members tended to be symptomatic (OR 2.053, 95% CI 1.130-3.730; p 0.018). Multivariable logistic regression analysis exhibited that performing tracheal intubation or extubation (OR 4.057, 95% CI 1.183-13.909; p 0.026) was associated with an increased likelihood of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas consistent use of N95 respirators (OR 0.369, 95% CI 0.201-0.680; p 0.001) and eye protection (OR 0.217, 95% CI 0.116-0.404; p < 0.001) were associated with an increased likelihood of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs comprised a considerable proportion of HCW infections during the pandemic of COVID-19. Those who performed tracheal intubation or extubation were most likely to develop related symptoms, whereas those taking aggressive measures, including consistent use of N95 masks and eye protection, tended to be asymptomatic cases.","Zhang, Shuai; Guo, Mengfei; Wu, Feng; Xiong, Nian; Ma, Yanling; Wang, Zhihui; Duan, Limin; Chen, Lan; Ouyang, Haixia; Jin, Yang",Clin Microbiol Infect,,164

We developed an ADCC assay utilizing a stably transfected, dual-reporter target cell line with inducible expression of a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on the cell surface. Using this assay, we analyzed 61 convalescent serum samples from adults with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and 15 samples from healthy uninfected controls. We found that 56 of 61 convalescent serum samples induced ADCC killing of SARS-CoV-2 S target cells, whereas none of the 15 healthy controls had detectable ADCC. We then found a modest decline in ADCC titer over a median 3-month follow-up in 21 patients who had serial samples available for analysis. We confirmed that the antibody-dependent target cell lysis was mediated primarily via the NK FcÎ³RIIIa receptor (CD16). This ADCC assay had high sensitivity and specificity for detecting serologic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.","Chen, Xuemin; Rostad, Christina A; Anderson, Larry J; Sun, He-Ying; Lapp, Stacey A; Stephens, Kathy; Hussaini, Laila; Gibson, Theda; Rouphael, Nadine; Anderson, Evan J",Virology,,164

Internet browsing data may predict case outbreaks in local populations that are yet to be confirmed. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether search-engine query patterns can help to predict COVID-19 case rates at the state and metropolitan area levels in the United States. METHODS: We used regional confirmed case data from the New York Times and Google Trends results from 50 states and 166 county-based designated market areas (DMA). We identified search terms whose activity precedes and correlates with confirmed case rates at the national level. We used univariate regression to construct a composite explanatory variable based on best-fitting search queries offset by temporal lags. We measured the raw and z-transformed Pearson correlation and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the explanatory variable with out-of-sample case rate data at the state and DMA levels. RESULTS: Predictions were highly correlated with confirmed case rates at the state (mean r=0.69, 95% CI 0.51-0.81; median RMSE 1.27, IQR 1.48) and DMA levels (mean r=0.51, 95% CI 0.39-0.61; median RMSE 4.38, IQR 1.80), using search data available up to 10 days prior to confirmed case rates. They fit case-rate activity in 49 of 50 states and in 103 of 166 DMA at a significance level of .05.

Moreover, we focus on mesenchymal stem cell therapy, which has shown safety and efficacy as a treatment of inflammatory and immune diseases. The cell therapy approach is now repurposed in patients with severe COVID-19. Numerous trials of mesenchymal stem cell therapy are ongoing, especially in China and the USA.

503167,The mini lungs and other organoids helping to beat COVID,2021,"This paper investigates economic impacts of COVID-19 on households based on differences in the socio-economic status (SES). We determine the household-level effects of the COVID-19 shock using income sources, types of industries, communities' resilience, household susceptibility, and relevant policy measures. For this purpose, we used primary data of 555 households collected through snowball sampling technique using an online survey questionnaire from different villages mostly located in Sichuan Province, China. Using step-wise binary logistic regression analysis, we estimated and validated the model. Results suggest the use of SES as a better measure for understanding the impacts of COVID-19 on different households. We find that households with low SES tend to depend more on farmland income and transfer payments from the government. Contrarily, high SES households focus more on business and local employment as sources of income generation. Poor households were less resilient and more likely to fall back into poverty due to COVID-19, while the opposite stands true for non-poor households with high SES. Based on the estimations, policies encouraging employment and businesses complemented with loans on lower interest rates are recommended, which may increase the SES, thus minimizing vulnerability and enhancing the households' resilience towards poverty alleviation and economic shocks.","Ur Rahman, Imran; Jian, Deng; Junrong, Liu; Shafi, Mohsin",PLoS One,,164

504324,Now is not the time,2020,"BACKGROUND: Blood collection center (BCC) employees are essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The employee callout rate, defined as the percentage of scheduled employees unable to report to work for any cause including COVID-19 illness or asymptomatic quarantine, was tracked to determine the impact of safety measures including social distancing, masks, enhanced disinfection protocols, and temperature screening. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A contact tracing and quarantine program was implemented for all employees, followed by additional safety measures including social distancing, masks, enhanced disinfection protocols, and temperature screening. The weekly callout rate was tracked nationally for 19,517 BCC employees over 9 months, from March to December 2020. RESULTS: Weekly employee callout rates increased after implementation of the contact tracing program due to asymptomatic employees placed into COVID-19-related quarantine. Mobile collections callouts increased by nearly fivefold the pre-pandemic baseline within the first 4 weeks, peaking at 9.7% in early April. Peaks for fixed site collections (5.0%) and manufacturing (6.7%) occurred nearly simultaneously. Shortly after implementation of all safety measures, the weekly callout rate declined for all three employee groups and has remained relatively stable with a mean callout rate of 4.3% for mobile collections, 2.4% for fixed site collections, and 3.7% for manufacturing despite further increase in new COVID-19 cases in the United States. CONCLUSION: Callouts for BCC employees during the COVID-19 pandemic initially increased, but subsequently declined and stabilized after implementation of safety measures. Since multiple interventions were implemented simultaneously, it is not possible to determine the individual impact of each measure on callout rate.","Coberly, Emily; Korich, Erin; Henesy, Michelle; Doerksen, Kate; Young, Pampee",Transfusion,,164
505285,Scientists exposed to coronavirus wonder: why weren't we notified?,2020,"Definitive pharmacological therapies for COVID-19 have yet to be identified. Several hundred trials are ongoing globally in the hope of a solution. However, nearly all treatments rely on systemic delivery but COVID-19 damages the lungs preferentially. The use of a targeted delivery approach is reviewed where engineered products are able to reach damaged lung tissue directly, which includes catheter-based and aerosol-based approaches. In this review we have outlined various target directed approaches which include microbubbles, extracellular vesicles including exosomes, adenosine nanoparticles, novel bio-objects, direct aerosol targeted pulmonary delivery and catheter-based drug delivery with reference to their relative effectiveness for the specific lesions. Currently several trials are ongoing to determine the effectiveness of such delivery systems alone and in conjunction with systemic therapies. Such approaches may prove to be very effective in the controlled and localized COVID-19 viral lesions in the lungs and potential sites. Moreover, localized delivery offered a safer delivery mode for such drugs which may have systemic adverse effects.","Kipshidze, Nicholas; Iversen, Patrick; Porter, Thomas R; Kipshidze, Nodar; Siddiqui, Fakiha; Dangas, George; Fareed, Jawed",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,,164

AIMS: To evaluate whether the diagnoses of colorectal, gastric and pancreatic cancers have been impacted by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Italy. METHODS: A survey designed to collect the number of histologically-proven diagnoses of the three cancers in gastroenterology services across Italy from January 1 to October 31 in 2017-2020. Non-parametric ANOVA for repeated measurements was applied to compare distributions by years and macro-areas. RESULTS: Compared to 2019, in 2020 gastric cancer diagnoses decreased by 15.9%, CRC by 11.9% and pancreatic by 9.9%. CRC distributions showed significant differences between all years, stomach cancer between 2018 and 2020 and 2019-2020, and pancreatic cancer only between 2017 and 2019. The 2019-2020 comparison showed fewer CRC diagnoses in the North (-13.7%), Center (-16.5%) and South (-4.1%), fewer stomach cancers in the North (-19.0%) and South (-9.4%), and fewer pancreatic cancers in the North (-14.1%) and Center (-4.7%), with an increase in the South (+12.3%). Distributions of CRC and gastric cancer were significantly different between all years in the North. CONCLUSIONS: This survey highlights the concerning effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnostic yield of gastroenterology services for stomach, colorectal and pancreatic cancers in Italy.","Buscarini, Elisabetta; Benedetti, Antonio; Monica, Fabio; Pasquale, Luigi; Buttitta, Francesco; Cameletti, Michela; Ferrari, Clarissa; Ricciardiello, Luigi",Dig. liver dis,,164

515083,Program of the 90th Annual Meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Mounting evidence demonstrates potential for fecal-oral transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The US Food and Drug Administration now requires SARS-CoV-2 testing of potential feces donors before the use of stool manufactured for fecal microbiota transplantation. We sought to develop and validate a high-sensitivity SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) procedure for testing stool specimens. METHODS: A modified extraction method was used with an RT-PCR assay adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention PCR protocol for respiratory specimens. Contrived specimens were created using pre-COVID-19 banked stool specimens and spiking in known concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific nucleic acid. The highest transcript concentration at which 2/2 or 1/2 SARS-CoV-2 targets were detected in 9/10 replicates was defined as the dual-target limit and single-target limit of detection, respectively. The clinical performance of the assay was evaluated with stool samples collected from 17 nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR-positive patients and 14 nasopharyngeal RT-PCR-negative patients. RESULTS: The dual-target and single-target limit of detection were 56 copies/µL and 3 copies/µL, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 was detected at concentrations as low as 0.6 copies/µL. Clinical stool samples from known COVID-19-positive patients demonstrated the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in stool up to 29 days from symptom onset with a high agreement with nasopharyngeal swab tests (kappa statistic of 0.95, P value < 0.001). DISCUSSION: The described RT-PCR test is a sensitive and flexible approach for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in stool specimens. We propose an integrated screening approach that incorporates this stool test to support continuation of fecal microbiota transplantation programs.","Babiker, Ahmed; Ingersoll, Jessica M; Adelman, Max W; Webster, Andrew S; Broder, Kari J; Stittleburg, Victoria; Waggoner, Jesse J; Kraft, Colleen S; Woodworth, Michael H",Clin Transl Gastroenterol,,164

Governments and key institutions have had to implement decisive responses to the danger posed by the coronavirus pandemic. Imposed change will increase the likelihood that alternative explanations take hold. In a proportion of the general population there may be strong scepticism, fear of being misled, and false conspiracy theories. Our objectives were to estimate the prevalence of conspiracy thinking about the pandemic and test associations with reduced adherence to government guidelines. METHODS: A non-probability online survey with 2501 adults in England, quota sampled to match the population for age, gender, income, and region. RESULTS: Approximately 50% of this population showed little evidence of conspiracy thinking, 25% showed a degree of endorsement, 15% showed a consistent pattern of endorsement, and 10% had very high levels of endorsement. Higher levels of coronavirus conspiracy thinking were associated with less adherence to all government guidelines and less willingness to take diagnostic or antibody tests or to be vaccinated. Such ideas were also associated with paranoia, general vaccination conspiracy beliefs, climate change conspiracy belief, a conspiracy mentality, and distrust in institutions and professions. Holding coronavirus conspiracy beliefs was also associated with being more likely to share opinions. CONCLUSIONS: In England there is appreciable endorsement of conspiracy beliefs about coronavirus. Such ideas do not appear confined to the fringes. The conspiracy beliefs connect to other forms of mistrust and are associated with less compliance with government guidelines and greater unwillingness to take up future tests and treatment.","Freeman, Daniel; Waite, Felicity; Rosebrock, Laina; Petit, Ariane; Causier, Chiara; East, Anna; Jenner, Lucy; Teale, Ashley-Louise; Carr, Lydia; Mulhall, Sophie; Bold, Emily; Lambe, Sinéad",Psychol Med,,164

Smoke from wildfires worsened the situation of isolated, as well as urban communities, already under an increasing toll of COVID-19. Here we review the impacts and the possible causes of the 2020 mega-fires and recommend improvements for public policies and fire management in this wetland. We calculated the amount of area burnt annually since 2003 and describe patterns in precipitation and water level measurements of the Paraguay River. Our analyses revealed that the 2020 wildfires were historically unprecedented, as 43% of the area (over 17,200 km2) had not been burnt previously in the last two decades. The extent of area affected in 2020 represents a 376% increase compared to the annual average of the area burnt annually in the last two decades, double than the value in 2019. Potential factors responsible for this increase are (i) severe drought decreased water levels, (ii) the fire corridor was located in the Paraguay River flood zone, (iii) constraints on firefighters, (iv) insufficient fire prevention strategy and agency budget reductions, and (v) recent landscape changes. Climate and land use change will further increase the frequency of these extreme events. To make fire management more efficient and cost-effective, we recommend the implementation of an Integrated Fire Management program in the Pantanal. Stakeholders should use existing traditional, local ecological, and scientific knowledge to form a collective strategy with clear, achievable, measurable goals, considering the socio-ecological context. Permanent fire brigades, including indigenous members, should conduct year-round fire management. Communities should cooperate to create a collaborative network for wildfire prevention, the location and characteristics (including flammability) of infrastructures should be (re)planned in fire-prone environments considering and managing fire-catalysed transitions, and depending on the severity of wildfires. The 2020 wildfires were tackled in an ad-hoc fashion and prioritisation of areas for urgent financial investment, management, protection, and restoration is necessary to prevent this catastrophe from happening again.","Garcia, Letícia Couto; Szabo, Judit K; de Oliveira Roque, Fabio; de Matos Martins Pereira, Alexandre; Nunes da Cunha, Catia; Damasceno-Júnior, Geraldo Alves; Morato, Ronaldo Gonçalves; Tomas, Walfrido Moraes; Libonati, Renata; Ribeiro, Danilo Bandini",J Environ Manage,,164

522507,How an early variant got ahead,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (CPL) lead to a significant decrease in emergency admissions worldwide. We performed a timely analysis of ischemic stroke (IS) and related consultations using the telestroke TEMPiS ""working diagnosis"" database prior (PL), within (WL), and after easing (EL) of CPL. METHODS: Twelve hospitals were selected and data analyzed regarding IS (including intravenous thrombolysis [intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen; IV rtPA] and endovascular thrombectomy [EVT]) and related events from February 1 to June 15 during 2017-2020. In addition, we aimed to correlate events to various mobile phone mobility data. RESULTS: Following the significant reduction of IS, IV rtPA, and EVT cases during WL compared to PL in 2020 longitudinally (p values <0.048), we observed increasing numbers of consultations, IS, recommendations for EVT, and IV rtPA with the network in EL over WL not reaching PL levels yet. Absolute numbers of all consultations paralleled best to mobility data of public transportation over walking and driving mobility. CONCLUSIONS: While the decrease in emergency admissions including stroke during CPL can only be in part attributed by patients not seeking medical attention, stroke awareness in the pandemic, and direct COVID-19 triggered stroke remains of high importance. The number of consultations in TEMPiS during the lockdown parallels best with mobility of public transportation. As a consequence, exposure to common viruses, well-known triggers for acute cerebrovascular events and other diseases, are reduced and may add to the decline in stroke consultations. Further studies comparing national responses toward the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and stroke incidences are needed.","Schlachetzki, Felix; Wilfling, Sibylle; Hubert, Nikolai Dominik; Wagner, Andrea; Haberl, Roman L; Linker, Ralf Andreas; Hubert, Gordian Jan",Cerebrovasc Dis,,164

The survey included sets of questions about demographics, health, and support, an open question about major concerns, and the Clinical Outcome Routine Evaluation (CORE-OM), a measure of mental distress. A total of 407 professionals, mean age 40, SD 11.2, fulfilling social distancing (99%) participated in the study. Participants were mostly female (67.8%) and married (64.8%). Using the Consensual Qualitative Research process for simple qualitative data (CQR-M), the main areas of concern were grouped into six domains, as follows: work, health, isolation, personal life and routine, social environment, and future. Many responses were multiple. They form categories indicating specific concerns within these domains. Quantitative data were analyzed by identifying the simple effects of potential predictors of mental distress. The results indicated medium effects of help with household chores (η(2) = 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.022–0.095)), psychiatric treatment (η(2) = 0.06, CI (0.030–0.110)), age (η(2) = 0.12, CI (0.070–0.170)), and physical exercise (η(2) = 0.12, CI (0.079–0.180)).

596104,Augur: a bioinformatics toolkit for phylogenetic analyses of human pathogens,2021-01-07,"COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease-2019) is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, known as the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This is a highly contagious disease that has already affected more than 220 countries globally, infecting more than 212 million people and resulting in the death of over 4.4 million people. This review aims to highlight the pertinent documentary evidence upon the adverse effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on several vital human organs. SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the lung tissue by causing diffuse alveolar damage and may result in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 infects the cell via cell surface receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Besides lungs, SARS-CoV-2 critically damage tissues in other vital human organs such as the heart, kidney, liver, brain, and gastrointestinal tract. The effect on the heart includes muscle dysfunction (acute or protracted heart failure), myocarditis, and cell necrosis. Within hepatic tissue, it alters serum aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels. It contributes to acute kidney injury (AKI). Localized infection of the brain can lead to loss or attenuation of olfaction, muscular pain, headaches, encephalopathy, dizziness, dysgeusia, psychomotor disorders, and stroke; while the gastrointestinal symptoms include the disruption of the normal intestinal mucosa, leading to diarrhea and abdominal pain. This review encompassed a topical streak of systemic malfunctions caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. As the pandemic is still in progress, more studies will enrich our understanding and analysis of this disease.","Shah, Muhammad Dawood; Sumeh, Aini Simon; Sheraz, Muhammad; Kavitha, Muthu Subash; Venmathi Maran, Balu Alagar; Rodrigues, Kenneth Francis",Biomed Pharmacother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34507116/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221009422?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332221009422; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112158,164

Considering the worldwide emergency status due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, effective pan-coronavirus antiviral drugs are required to tackle the ongoing as well as future (re)emerging virus outbreaks. Protein kinase CK2 has been deemed a promising therapeutic target in COVID-19 supported by its in vitro pharmacologic inhibition and molecular studies on SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. CIGB-325 is a first-in-class synthetic peptide impairing the CK2-mediated signaling whose safety and clinical benefit have been evidenced in Covid-19 and cancer patients after intravenous administration. Here, we explored the putative antiviral effect of CIGB-325 over MDBK cells infected by bovine coronavirus (BCoV) Mebus. Importantly, CIGB-325 inhibited both the cytopathic effect and the number of plaques forming units with a half-inhibitory concentrations IC50 = 3.5 μM and 17.7 μM, respectively. Accordingly, viral protein accumulation at the cytoplasm was clearly reduced by treating BCoV-infected cells with CIGB-325 over time, as determined by immunocytochemistry. Of note, data from pull-down assay followed by western blot and/or mass spectrometry identification revealed physical interaction of CIGB-325 with nucleocapsid (N) protein and a bona fide cellular CK2 substrates. Functional enrichment and network analysis from the CIGB-325 interacting proteins indicated cytoskeleton reorganization and protein folding as the most represented biological processes disturbed by this anti-CK2 peptide. Altogether, our findings not only unveil the direct antiviral activity of CIGB-325 on coronavirus infection but also provide molecular clues underlying such effect. Also, our data reinforce the scientific rationality behind the pharmacologic inhibition of CK2 to treat coronavirus infections.","Ramón, Ailyn C.; Pérez, George V.; Caballero, Evelin; Rosales, Mauro; Aguilar, Daylén; Vázquez-Blomquist, Dania; Ramos, Yassel; Rodríguez, Arielis; Falcón, Viviana; Rodríguez, María P.; Ke, Yang; Perera, Yasser; Perea, Silvio E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.08.447588,164
598372,The pandemic by numbers,2021-06-05,"The COVID-19 pandemic has illuminated the critical need to make greater investments in public health and build the capacity of the public health workforce. Among the professional competencies needed to address the ongoing morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19, as well as other current and future public health challenges, is the ability to effectively engage in the political process. While we acknowledge that public health institutions and workers are under-resourced and are grateful for their tireless efforts to control the pandemic, we argue that their efforts have been severely hampered by a notable absence from politics. We argue that our ability to protect and promote public health has been further challenged by divisive political rhetoric from the former presidential administration, which has amplified a culture of self-interest and individualism. Such values are counter to public health and threaten our ability to address the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on low-income communities and communities of color, along with the myriad of health inequities experienced by marginalized communities in the US. We assert that public health professionals must be better equipped and supported in their efforts to challenge powerful majorities that have generated such unhealthy and unequal social and environmental conditions. Policy change related to social determinants of health should be an integral component of our intervention strategies and political advocacy should be considered a core competency for training future public health professionals. The field needs professionals comfortable and adept at working within the political sphere; students are eager for skills that allow them to translate their passion for social justice in health; and the persistent and pervasive health inequities experienced by marginalized communities demand such action.","Knight, Erin; Bogan, Corinne",Dela J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34467199/; https://doi.org/10.32481/djph.2021.03.014,164
599947,Biochemical terrorism: the medical threat in the twenty-first century(),2004-06-05,"In this paper, we propose to advance and transform today’s healthcare system using a model of networked health care called Cybercare. Cybercare means “health care in cyberspace” — for example, doctors consulting with patients via videoconferencing across a distributed network; or patients receiving care locally — in neighborhoods, “minute clinics,” and homes — using information technologies such as telemedicine, smartphones, and wearable sensors to link to tertiary medical specialists. This model contrasts with traditional health care, in which patients travel (often a great distance) to receive care from providers in a central hospital. The Cybercare model shifts health care provision from hospital to home; from specialist to generalist; and from treatment to prevention. Cybercare employs advanced technology to deliver services efficiently across the distributed network — for example, using telemedicine, wearable sensors and cell phones to link patients to specialists and upload their medical data in near-real time; using information technology (IT) to rapidly detect, track, and contain the spread of a global pandemic; or using cell phones to manage medical care in a disaster situation. Cybercare uses seven “pillars” of technology to provide medical care: genomics; telemedicine; robotics; simulation, including virtual and augmented reality; artificial intelligence (AI), including intelligent agents; the electronic medical record (EMR); and smartphones. All these technologies are evolving and blending. The technologies are integrated functionally because they underlie the Cybercare network, and/or form part of the care for patients using that distributed network. Moving health care provision to a networked, distributed model will save money, improve outcomes, facilitate access, improve security, increase patient and provider satisfaction, and may mitigate the international global burden of disease. In this paper we discuss how Cybercare is being implemented now, and envision its growth by 2030.","Rosen, Joseph M.; Kun, Luis; Mosher, Robyn E.; Grigg, Elliott; Merrell, Ronald C.; Macedonia, Christian; Klaudt-Moreau, Julien; Price-Smith, Andrew; Geiling, James",Health Technol (Berl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27358760/,164

There is no vaccine for HRSV and anti-viral therapeutics are not broadly applicable. To investigate the effect of HRSV biology in children, nasopharyngeal aspirates were taken from children with different viral loads and a combined high throughput RNAseq and label free quantitative proteomics approach was used to characterize the nucleic acid and proteins in these samples. HRSV proteins were identified in the nasopharyngeal aspirates from infected children, and their abundance correlated with viral load (Ct value), confirming HRSV infection. Analysis of the HRSV genome indicated that the children were infected with sub-group A virus and that minor variants in nucleotide frequency occurred in discrete clusters along the HRSV genome, and within a patient clustered distinctly within the glycoprotein gene. Data from the samples were binned into four groups; no-HRSV infection (control), high viral load (Ct < 20), medium viral load (Ct = 20–25), and low viral load (Ct > 25). Cellular proteins associated with the anti-viral response (e.g., ISG15) were identified in the nasopharyngeal aspirates and their abundance was correlated with viral load. These combined approaches have not been used before to study HRSV biology in vivo and can be readily applied to the study the variation of virus host interactions.","Aljabr, Waleed; Armstrong, Stuart; Rickett, Natasha Y.; Pollakis, Georgios; Touzelet, Olivier; Cloutman-Green, Elaine; Matthews, David A.; Hiscox, Julian A.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658630/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11100926,164

This work brings together perspectives on mathematical modeling of infectious diseases, highlights the different modeling frameworks that have been used for modeling COVID-19 and illustrates some of the models that our groups have developed and applied specifically for COVID-19. We discuss three models for COVID-19 spread: the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model that incorporates contact tracing (SEIR-TTI model) and describes the spread of COVID-19 among these population cohorts, the more detailed agent-based model called Covasim describing transmission between individuals, and the Rule-Based Model (RBM) which can be thought of as a combination of both. We showcase the key methodologies of these approaches, their differences as well as the ways in which they are interlinked.

OBJECTIVES: To identify behaviors and evaluate trends in COVID-19–mitigating practices in a predominantly Black and Hispanic population, to identify differences in practices by self-reported ethnicity, and to evaluate whether federal emergency financial assistance was associated with SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study was conducted by telephone from July 1 through August 30, 2020, on a random sample of adults who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing at a safety-net health care system in Chicago during the surge in COVID-19 cases in the spring of 2020. Behaviors and receipt of a stimulus check were compared between participants testing positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2. Differences in behaviors and temporal trends were assessed by race and ethnicity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed using nasopharyngeal quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction testing. Mitigating behaviors and federal emergency financial assistance were assessed by survey. Race and ethnicity data were collected from electronic health records. RESULTS: Of 750 randomly sampled individuals, 314 (41.9%) consented to participate (169 [53.8%] women). Of those, 159 (51%) self-reported as Hispanic and 155 (49%) as non-Hispanic (120 [38.2%] Black), of whom 133 (84%) and 76 (49%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, respectively. For all participants, consistent mask use (public transport: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.00; 95% CI, 0.00-0.34; social gatherings: aOR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.00-0.50; running errands: aOR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.07-0.42; at work: aOR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.07-0.79) and hand sanitizer use (aOR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.13-0.52) were associated with lower odds of infection. During 3 sampled weeks, mitigation practices were less frequent among Hispanic compared with non-Hispanic participants (eg, mask use while running errands: aOR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.15-0.46). Hispanic participants were at high risk of infection (aOR, 5.52; 95% CI, 4.30-7.08) and more likely to work outside the home (aOR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.27-3.30) compared with non-Hispanic participants, possibly because of limited receipt of stimulus checks (aOR, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.02-0.07) or unemployment benefits (aOR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16-0.74). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study of adults in a large US city, public health messaging improved preventive behaviors over time but lagged among Hispanic participants; messaging tailored to Hispanic communities, especially for mask use, should be prioritized. Hispanic individuals were at higher risk for infection, more often worked outside the home, and were less likely to have received a stimulus check; this suggests larger studies are needed to evaluate the provision of economic support on SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in low-income populations.","Badri, Sheila; Sardá, Vanessa; Moncada, Jorge Soria; Merçon, Monica; Rezai, Katayoun; Weinstein, Robert A.; Trick, William E.",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34581798/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.25187,164

We selected 114 candidate SNPs from 12 antiviral genes using an LD tagSNP selection approach and genotyped them in a cohort of 738 schoolchildren immunized with two doses of rubella vaccine. Associations between SNPs/haplotypes and rubella virus-specific immune measures were assessed using linear regression methodologies. We identified 23 significant associations (p<0.05) between polymorphisms within the 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) gene cluster, and rubella virus-specific IL-2, IL-10, IL-6 secretion and antibody levels. The minor allele variants of three OAS1 SNPs (rs3741981/Ser162Gly, rs1051042/Thr361Arg, rs2660), located in a linkage disequilibrium block of functional importance, were significantly associated with an increase in rubella virus-specific IL-2/Th1 response (p≤0.024). Seven OAS1 and OAS3 promoter/regulatory SNPs were similarly associated with IL-2 secretion. Importantly, two SNPs (rs3741981 and rs10774670), independently cross-regulated rubella virus-specific IL-10 secretion levels (p≤0.031). Furthermore, both global tests and individual haplotype analyses revealed significant associations between OAS1 haplotypes and rubella virus-specific cytokine secretion. Our results suggest that innate immunity and OAS genetic variations are likely involved in modulating the magnitude and quality of the adaptive immune responses to live attenuated rubella vaccine.","Haralambieva, Iana H.; Dhiman, Neelam; Ovsyannikova, Inna G.; Vierkant, Robert A.; Pankratz, V.

However, when conducting auditory experiments via online methods, the researcher has limited control over the participants’ listening environment. We offer a new method to probe one aspect of that environment, headphone use. Headphones not only provide better control of sound presentation but can also “shield” the listener from background noise. Here we present a rapid (< 3 min) headphone screening test based on Huggins Pitch (HP), a perceptual phenomenon that can only be detected when stimuli are presented dichotically. We validate this test using a cohort of “Trusted” online participants who completed the test using both headphones and loudspeakers. The same participants were also used to test an existing headphone test (AP test; Woods et al., 2017, Attention Perception Psychophysics). We demonstrate that compared to the AP test, the HP test has a higher selectivity for headphone users, rendering it as a compelling alternative to existing methods. Overall, the new HP test correctly detects 80% of headphone users and has a false-positive rate of 20%. Moreover, we demonstrate that combining the HP test with an additional test–either the AP test or an alternative based on a beat test (BT)–can lower the false-positive rate to ~ 7%. This should be useful in situations where headphone use is particularly critical (e.g., dichotic or spatial manipulations).

We examine polarization in cues sent to the public by current members of the U.S. House and Senate during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, measuring polarization as the ability to correctly classify the partisanship of tweets’ authors based solely on the text and the dates they were sent. We find that Democrats discussed the crisis more frequently–emphasizing threats to public health and American workers–while Republicans placed greater emphasis on China and businesses. Polarization in elite discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic peaked in mid-February—weeks after the first confirmed case in the United States—and continued into March.

Colchicine is widely investigated for cardioprotection of COVID-19 patients since it can prevent the phenomenon of ‘cytokine storm’ and may reduce the complications arising from COVID-19. Despite the potentially beneficial effects of colchicine, there is no consensus on the appropriate dosage regimen and numerous schemes are currently used. 2. In this study, simulations were performed to identify the ability of dosage regimens to attain plasma levels in CVOID-19 patients, known to be generally safe and efficacious. Since renal and hepatic impairment, as well as, drug-drug interactions have been identified to be the most significant factors increasing colchicine toxicity, the impact of these interactions was assessed in the simulations. 3. Some dosage regimens lead to high colchicine concentrations, while others result in sub-therapeutic levels. Additional dosage schemes were proposed in this study aiming to be applied in patients with clearance insufficiency. Colchicine administration of 0.5 mg twice daily, can be considered safe and effective. In cases of clearance impairment, doses as low as 0.25 mg thrice or twice daily should be applied. 4.

Independent external clinical validation of performance characteristics is of paramount importance. Methods: Four fully automated assays, Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total (COV2T) and SARS-CoV-2 IgG (COV2G) were evaluated using 350 pre-pandemic samples and 700 samples from 245 COVID-19 patients (158 hospitalized, 87 outpatients). Results: All tests showed very high diagnostic specificity. Sensitivities in samples collected at least 14 days after disease onset were slightly lower than manufacturers' claims for Roche (93.04%), Abbott (90.83%), and Siemens COV2T (90.26%), and distinctly lower for Siemens COV2G (78.76%). Concordantly negative results were enriched for immunocompromised patients. ROC curve analyses suggest a lowering of the cut-off index for the Siemens COV2G assay. Finally, the combination of two anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays is feasible when considering borderline reactive results. Conclusions: Thorough on-site evaluation of commercially available serologic tests for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 remains imperative for laboratories. The potentially impaired sensitivity of the Siemens COV2G necessitates a switch to the company's newly filed SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (sCOVG) for follow-up studies.

However, understanding additional characteristics that predict disease outbreaks and uncovering landscape factors related to between-farm spread are crucial steps toward risk mitigation. This study integrates animal movements with environmental risk factors to identify the occurrence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) outbreaks. Using weekly farm-level incidence data from 332 sow farms, we applied machine-learning algorithms to quantify associations between risk factors and PEDV outbreaks with the ultimate goal of training predictive models and to identify the most important factors associated with PEDV occurrence. Our best algorithm was able to correctly predict whether an outbreak occurred during one-week periods with >80% accuracy. The most important predictors included pig movements into neighboring farms. Other important neighborhood attributes included hog density, environmental and weather factors such as vegetation, wind speed, temperature, and precipitation, and topographical features such as slope. Our neighborhood-based approach allowed us to simultaneously capture disease risks associated with long-distance animal movement as well as local spatial dynamics. The model presented here forms the foundation for near real-time disease mapping and will advance disease surveillance and control for endemic swine pathogens in the United States.","Machado, Gustavo; Vilalta, Carles; Recamonde-Mendoza, Mariana; Corzo, Cesar; Torremorell, Montserrat; Perez, Andrez; VanderWaal, Kimberly",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36934-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679594/,164

PEDV is an alpha-coronavirus replicating primarily in porcine intestinal cells. PEDV vaccines are available in Asia and Europe, and conditionally-licensed vaccines recently became available in the United States but the efficacies of these vaccines in eliminating PEDV from swine populations are questionable. In this study, the immunogenicity of a subunit vaccine based on the spike protein of PEDV, which was directly targeted to porcine dendritic cells (DCs) expressing Langerin, was assessed. The PEDV S antigen was delivered to the dendritic cells through a single-chain antibody specific to Langerin and the targeted cells were stimulated with cholera toxin adjuvant. This approach, known as “dendritic cell targeting,” greatly improved PEDV S antigen-specific T cell interferon-γ responses in the CD4(pos)CD8(pos) T cell compartment in pigs as early as 7 days upon transdermal administration. When the vaccine protein was targeted to Langerin(pos) DCs systemically through intramuscular vaccination, it induced higher serum IgG and IgA responses in pigs, though these responses require a booster dose, and the magnitude of T cell responses were lower as compared to transdermal vaccination. We conclude that PEDV spike protein domains targeting Langerin-expressing dendritic cells significantly increased CD4 T cell immune responses in pigs. The results indicate that the immunogenicity of protein subunit vaccines can be greatly enhanced by direct targeting of the vaccine antigens to desirable dendritic cell subsets in pigs.","Subramaniam, Sakthivel; Cao, Dianjun; Tian, Debin; Cao, Qian M.; Overend, Christopher; Yugo, Danielle M.; Matzinger, Shannon R.; Rogers, Adam J.; Heffron, C.

Herein, we show that PRMT1 methylates SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein at residues R95 and R177 within RGG/RG motifs, preferred PRMT target sequences. We confirmed arginine methylation of N protein by immunoblotting viral proteins extracted from SARS-CoV-2 virions isolated from cell culture. Type I PRMT inhibitor (MS023) or substitution of R95 or R177 with lysine inhibited interaction of N protein with the 5’-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, a property required for viral packaging. We also defined the N protein interactome in HEK293 cells, which identified PRMT1 and many of its RGG/RG substrates, including the known interacting protein G3BP1 as well as other components of stress granules (SG), which are part of the host antiviral response. Methylation of R95 regulated the ability of N protein to suppress the formation of SGs, as R95K substitution or MS023 treatment blocked N-mediated suppression of SGs. Also, the co-expression of methylarginine reader TDRD3 quenched N protein-mediated suppression of SGs in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, pre-treatment of VeroE6 cells with MS023 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication.

Our aim was to evaluate the involvement of respiratory and oropharyngeal viruses in acute episodes of ICRP. Seventy children were studied, 50 patients and 20 age‐matched controls, in a 2‐year follow‐up study. Saliva samples were taken from the parotid duct and analyzed by viral isolation and immunofluorescence for adenovirus (Ad), respiratory sincitial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PI), influenza virus (Flu), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Paired sera samples were tested by ELISA for anti‐Epstein‐Barr virus (EBV) IgG and anti‐mumps IgM and IgG. Viral infections were detected in 7/50 (14%) cases of the ICRP group: one CMV; 2 Enteroviruses isolated in human embryonic lung fibroblast cells; 1 Flu A; and 3 mumps virus. No EBV seroconversions were detected. In the control group, 2 out of the 20 children had an asymptomatic mumps positive IgM titer. Our data indicate that the main respiratory and oropharyngeal viruses are not the cause of acute episodes of ICRP in Chilean children. J. Med.

Weather characteristics 2 weeks prior are used as instrumental variables for causal inference. Stringent quarantines, city lockdowns, and local public health measures imposed in late January significantly decreased the virus transmission rate. The virus spread was contained by the middle of February. Population outflow from the outbreak source region posed a higher risk to the destination regions than other factors, including geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. We quantify the effects of different public health measures in reducing the number of infections through counterfactual analyses.

We aimed to assess the accuracy of exhaled breath analysis by electronic nose (eNose) for the discrimination between individuals with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: This was a prospective real-world study of individuals presenting to public test facility for SARS-CoV-2 detection by molecular amplification tests (TMA or RT-PCR). After sampling of a combined throat/nasopharyngeal swab, breath profiles were obtained using a cloud-connected eNose. Data-analysis involved advanced signal processing and statistics based on independent t-tests followed by linear discriminant and ROC analysis. Data from the training set were tested in a validation, a replication and an asymptomatic set. Findings: For the analysis 4510 individuals were available. In the training set (35 individuals with; 869 without SARS-CoV-2), the eNose sensors were combined into a composite biomarker with a ROC-AUC of 0.947 (CI:0.928-0.967). These results were confirmed in the validation set (0.957; CI:0.942-0.971, n=904) and externally validated in the replication set (0.937; CI:0.926-0.947, n=1948) and the asymptomatic set (0.909; CI:0.879-0.938, n=754). Selecting a cut-off value of 0.30 in the training set resulted in a sensitivity/specificity of 100/78, >99/84, 98/82% in the validation, replication and asymptomatic set, respectively. Interpretation: eNose represents a quick and non-invasive method to reliably rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection in public health test facilities and can be used as a screening test to define who needs an additional confirmation test.

637418,Weakened defences,2020-03-28,"Background : Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has necessitated public health responses on an unprecedented scale. Controlling infectious diseases requires understanding of the conditions that increase spread. Prior studies have identified sociodemographic, epidemiological and geographic associations. Ireland offers an unusual opportunity to quantify how high infection rates in one country impacted cases in a neighbouring country. Methods : We analysed official statistics on confirmed COVID-19 cases on the island of Ireland for 52 weeks from March 2020. Our main research question was: Did higher cases in Northern Ireland (NI) impact the number of cases in the Republic of Ireland (ROI)? We used least squares regression to compare confirmed cases in ROI counties that border NI with the rest of the state. We included in our model sociodemographic, epidemiological and geographic factors. We employed the latitude of each county town as an instrumental variable to isolate a quasi-experimental estimate of the cross-border spread. Results : In the quasi-experimental framework, and controlling for population density, age distribution and circulatory disease prevalence, border counties had an extra 21.0 (95%CI: 8.4-33.6) confirmed COVID-19 cases per 1000 people. This equates to an estimated 9,611 additional cases in ROI, or 4% of the national total in the first year of the pandemic. Our results were substantively similar in non-experimental frameworks, with alternative additional predictors, and in sensitivity analyses. Additionally, population density in ROI counties was positively associated with confirmed cases and higher proportions of residents in the professional classes was negatively associated. Conclusion : On the island of Ireland during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, high infection rates in NI increased cases in the neighbouring ROI. Maximising co-ordination of pandemic responses among neighbouring countries is essential to minimising disease spread, and its associated disruptions to society and the economy. Socioeconomic disadvantage appeared to confer significant additional risk of spread.","Ahmed, Rakesh; May, Peter",HRB Open Res,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13263.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34355116/,164

While evidence on the effects of HIV co-infection on MDR/RR-TB treatment outcomes is well-documented, little published evidence describes the effects of MDR/RR-TB treatment on HIV disease. METHODS: We conducted a review of literature published prior to June 2020. We searched Pubmed, CINAHL, and EMBASE using variations of the terms “multidrug-resistant tuberculosis,” “HIV,” and either “CD4” or “viral load.” Two reviewers independently completed title and abstract screening, full-text screening, article evaluation, and data extraction. We also included five published articles evaluated as evidence by the World Health Organization (WHO) in preparation for the 2019 MDR/RR-TB treatment guideline update. RESULTS: A total of 459 references were returned, with 362 remaining after duplicate removal. Following article screening, six manuscripts were included. Articles reported CD4 count and/or viral load results for MDR/RR-TB and HIV co-infected patients during and/or after MDR/RR-TB treatment. The additional five references identified from the WHO guideline revision did not report HIV disease indicators after MDR/RR-TB initiation. CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of evidence on HIV disease indicators following MDR/RR-TB treatment.

Although there long has been substantial interest in the associations between city living and health, relatively little work has tried to understand how and why cities affect population health. This reflects both the number and complexity of determinants and of the absence of a unified framework that integrates the multiple factors that influence the health of urban populations. This paper presents a conceptual framework for studying how urban living affects population health. The framework rests on the assumption that urban populations are defined by size, density, diversity, and complexity, and that health in urban populations is a function of living conditions that are in turn shaped by municipal determinants and global and national trends. The framework builds on previous urban health research and incorporates multiple determinants at different levels. It is intended to serve as a model to guide public health research and intervention.","Galea, Sandro; Freudenberg, Nicholas; Vlahov, David",Soc Sci Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953604003223; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953604003223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15589671/,164

Their use in diabetic wounds specifically, however, remains pre-clinical and their efficacy remains uncertain less clear. A systematic review of preclinical studies is needed to determine the efficacy of MSC-EVs in the treatment of diabetic wounds to accelerate the clinical translation of this cell-based therapy. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched (to June 23, 2020). All English-language, full-text, controlled interventional studies comparing MSC-EVs to placebo or a “no treatment” arm in animal models of diabetic wounds were included. Study outcomes, including wound closure (primary outcome), scar width, blood vessel number and density, and re-epithelialisation were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. Risk of bias (ROB) was assessed using the SYRCLE tool for pre-clinical animal studies. RESULTS: A total of 313 unique records were identified from our search, with 10 full text articles satisfying inclusion criteria (n = 136 animals). The administration of MSC-EVs improved closure of diabetic wounds compared to controls with a large observed effect (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) 5.48, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 3.55–8.13). Healing was further enhanced using MSC-EVs enriched in non-coding RNAs or microRNAs compared to controls (SMD 9.89, 95%CI 7.32–12.46). Other outcomes, such as blood vessel density and number, scar width, and re-epithelialisation were improved with the administration of MSC-EVs, with a large effect. ROB across studies was unclear. CONCLUSION: MSC-EVs, particularly following enrichment for specific RNAs, are a promising treatment for diabetic wounds in pre-clinical studies and translation to the clinical domain appears warranted.

This study assessed the present status of M. pneumoniae infection in Japan and clinical end-points to distinguish children with MR-M. pneumoniae. METHODS: During an outbreak of M. pneumoniae infections in Fukuoka, Japan in 2010–11, a total of 105 children with clinically suspected M. pneumoniae infection were enrolled. M. pneumoniae was analyzed for macrolide resistance in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene. Sixty -five patients with PCR positive for M. pneumoniae were analyzed with regard to clinical symptoms, efficacy of several antimicrobial agents and several laboratory data. RESULTS: Causative pathogens were detected in 81.0% (85 of 105) and M. pneumoniae was identified 61.9% (65 of 105). The resistance rate of M. pneumoniae was 89.2% (58 of 65) in this general pediatric outpatient setting. Patients infected with MR-M. pneumoniae showed longer times to resolution of fever and required frequent changes of the initially prescribed macrolide to another antimicrobial agent. We observed three different genotypes of M. pneumoniae including the rarely reported A2063T mutation (A2063G: 31 strains, A2063T: 27 strains, no mutation: 7 strains). Drug susceptibility testing showed different antimicrobial susceptibility profiles for each genotype. Serum IFN-gamma, IL-6 and IP-10 levels were higher in patients with MR-genotypes than in those infected with no-mutation strains (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Macrolide resistance is more common than previously thought and a small epidemic of rarely reported A2063T mutation was observed in Fukuoka, Japan. Furthermore our results reveal the possibility that levels of certain inflammatory cytokines may be a candidate to predict MR-M.pneumoniae infection.","Matsuda, Kentaro; Narita, Mitsuo; Sera, Nobuyuki; Maeda, Eriko; Yoshitomi, Hideaki; Ohya, Hitomi; Araki, Yuko; Kakuma, Tatsuyuki; Fukuoh, Atsushi; Matsumoto, Kenji",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-13-591; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24330612/,164

S protein and huEGFRt coding sequences are separated by a T2A self‐cleaving sequence, allowing to accurately quantify the presence of anti‐S immunoglobulins by calculating a score based on the ratio of fluorescence intensities obtained by double‐staining with the test sera and anti‐EGFR. The method allows to detect immune individuals regardless of the result of other serological tests or even repeated PCR monitoring.

The paucity of available antifungal drug classes, combined with the increased occurrence of multidrug resistance in fungi, has led to new clinical challenges in the treatment of fungal infections. Candida auris is a recently emerged multidrug resistant human fungal pathogen that has become a worldwide public health threat. C. auris clinical isolates are often resistant to one or more antifungal drug classes, and thus, there is a high unmet medical need for the development of new therapeutic strategies effective against C. auris. Additionally, C. auris possesses several virulence traits, including the ability to form biofilms, further contributing to its drug resistance, and complicating the treatment of C. auris infections. Here we assessed red, green, and blue visible lights alone and in combination with photosensitizing compounds for their efficacies against C. auris biofilms. We found that (1) blue light inhibited and disrupted C. auris biofilms on its own and that the addition of photosensitizing compounds improved its antibiofilm potential; (2) red light inhibited and disrupted C. auris biofilms, but only in combination with photosensitizing compounds; and (3) green light inhibited C. auris biofilms in combination with photosensitizing compounds, but had no effects on disrupting C. auris biofilms.

653856,Survival in a zombie apocalypse,2020-04-25,"PURPOSE: Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a severe immunological complication that occurs after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Although oral cGVHD occurs in >25 % of cGVHD patients and leads to decreased quality of life, its etiology is poorly understood. The present retrospective cross-sectional analysis of oral cGVHD patients sought to (1) test the feasibility of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify protein biomarkers of oral cGVHD and (2) to gain a clearer understanding of salivary proteins impacted by oral cGVHD. METHODS: Using unstimulated whole saliva, we compared pooled saliva from five patients with a diagnosis of moderate or severe oral cGVHD, with a gender-and age- matched pool of five cGVHD patients with no oral mucosal findings. LC-MS/MS was used to identify salivary proteins, followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Selected mass spectrometric findings, including lactotransferrin, lactoperoxidase, and albumin, were confirmed by targeted label-free quantification. RESULTS: LC-MS/MS led to confident identification of 180 proteins. Of these proteins, 102 changed in abundance at least 2 fold, including 12 proteins identified only in the No oral cGVHD group. Downregulation of ~0.4 fold was confirmed for both lactotransferrin and lactoperoxidase in Oral cGVHD saliva using targeted label-free quantification. IPA analysis implicated pathways involved in cellular metabolism and immunoregulation. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of salivary lactoperoxidase, lactotransferrin, and several cysteine proteinase inhibitor family proteins suggests impaired oral antimicrobial host immunity in cGVHD patients. This shotgun proteomic analysis of oral cGVHD saliva using targeted label-free quantification of select proteins supports the use of mass spectrometry for future validation in a large patient population as noninvasive tests for screening, early detection, and monitoring of cGVHD.

They excluded a side effect of the low molecular weight heparin therapy that all patients underwent during the course of the disease or other possible causes. Alterations of the coagulation state or a weakness of the vascular wall due toa presumed endotheliitis SARS-CoV-2 infection induced, are hypothesized by the authors. Investigation and follow-up for possible hemorrhagic problems in patients with COVID-19 is recommended. In particular, clinicians should be vigilant about retroperitoneal hemorrhage in COVID-19 patients. In addition to the fact that these patients are being treated with anticoagulants, anemia and abdominal pain are the signs that should lead us to suspect this type of haemorrhage. More studies are needed to understand if COVID-19 can be directly associated with bleeding.

Therefore, we discussed the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on women, children and young patients, particularly those with underlying cardiovascular comorbidities or congenital heart disease. Furthermore, we gathered and distilled the existing body of literature that describes their cardiovascular complications and the recommended actions in favour of those patients toward the post-peak pandemic period.

The role of open science to reduce research waste,2021-07-29,"AIM: To assess the performance of front‐line nurses, who believed they were living out their calling, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic. BACKGROUND: Although as a profession nursing generally requires high levels of performance, the disruption arising from an infectious disease outbreak increases the work stress and decreases the performance of front‐line nurses. How this situation can be improved has yet to be thoroughly examined. METHOD: We used a snowball sampling technique to recruit 339 nurses who were originally from outside Hubei but volunteered to join medical teams going to Hubei to tackle COVID‐19. RESULTS: Drawing on the theory of work as a calling, we found that living a calling had a positive effect on front‐line nurses’ performance through the clinical and relational care they provided. Perceived supervisor support strengthened these mediated relationships. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that despite the constraints associated with pandemics, front‐line nurses who are living a calling are able to provide better clinical and relational care to infected patients, which in turn improves their performance. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: The findings of this study suggest that hospitals can introduce career educational interventions to enhance nurses’ ability to discern and live out their calling to improve their performance.","Zhou, Yan; Asante, Eric Adom; Zhuang, Yiyu; Wang, Jie; Zhu, Yue; Shen, Lihua",J Nurs Manag,https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33058323/,164
655306,DeepPurpose: a deep learning library for drug–target interaction prediction,2020-12-12,"At present, concerns that the recent global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants could compromise the current vaccines have been raised, highlighting the urgent demand for new vaccines capable of eliciting T cell-mediated immune responses, as well as B cell-mediated neutralizing antibody production. In this study, we developed a novel recombinant Mycobacterium paragordonae expressing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) (rMpg-RBD-7) that is capable of eliciting RBD-specific immune responses in vaccinated mice. The potential use of rMpg-RBD-7 as a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 infections was evaluated in in vivo using mouse models of two different modules, one for single-dose vaccination and the other for two-dose vaccination. In a single-dose vaccination model, we found that rMpg-RBD-7 versus a heat-killed strain could exert an enhanced cell-mediated immune (CMI) response, as well as a humoral immune response capable of neutralizing the RBD and ACE2 interaction. In a two-dose vaccination model, rMpg-RBD-7 in a two-dose vaccination could also exert a stronger CMI and humoral immune response to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infections in pseudoviral or live virus infection systems, compared to single dose vaccinations of rMpg-RBD or two-dose RBD protein immunization. In conclusion, our data showed that rMpg-RBD-7 can lead to an enhanced CMI response and humoral immune responses in mice vaccinated with both single- or two-dose vaccination, highlighting its feasibility as a novel vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first in which mycobacteria is used as a delivery system for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.","Kim, Byoung-Jun; Jeong, Hyein; Seo, Hyejun; Lee, Mi-Hyun; Shin, Hyun Mu; Kim, Bum-Joon",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.712274; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34512635/,164

MATERIAL/METHODS: A survey study was conducted among 120 front-line medical staff in the fight against COVID-19, of which 60 medical staff worked at the designated hospital (experimental group) and 60 medical staff worked at the non-designated hospital (control group). The Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) were used to assess mental status. Sleep status was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RESULTS: SCL-90 scores of somatization, depression, anxiety, and terror were higher than normal in front-line medical staff at the designated hospital. The SAS (45.89±1.117), SDS (50.13±1.813), and PCL-C (50.13±1.813) scores in the experimental group were higher than the normal control group, and were significantly different from those in the control group on SDS and PCL-C scales (P<0.05). The total average PSQI of the experimental group was 16.07±3.761, indicating that the sleep quality was poor. Among them, participants with moderate insomnia reached 61.67%, and participants with severe insomnia reached 26.67%. CONCLUSIONS: There are psychological symptoms and sleep symptoms in front-line medical staff who participate in the fight against COVID-19, and they affect each other.

A simple and easy-to-use model for predicting mortality based on data readily available to clinicians in the first 24 hours of hospital admission might be useful in directing scarce medical and personnel resources toward those patients at greater risk of dying. With this goal in mind, we evaluated factors predictive of in-hospital mortality in a random sample of 100 patients (derivation cohort) hospitalized for COVID-19 at our institution in April and May, 2020 and created potential models to test in a second random sample of 148 patients (validation cohort) hospitalized for the same disease over the same time period in the same institution. Two models (Model A: two variables, presence of pneumonia and ischemia); (Model B: three variables, age > 65 years, supplemental oxygen ≥ 4 L/min, and C-reactive protein (CRP) > 10 mg/L) were selected and tested in the validation cohort. Model B appeared the better of the two, with an AUC in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of 0.74 versus 0.65 in Model A, but the AUC differences were not significant (p = 0.24. Model B also appeared to have a more robust separation of mortality between the lowest (none of the three variables present) and highest (all three variables present) scores at 0% and 71%, respectively.

METHOD: Caregivers of patients with ED (n = 254) and a comparison group of non‐ED caregivers (N = 254) were recruited at baseline. Additionally, caregivers of patients with ED were invited into a free 4‐week online education program, with an additional online group as support. Depression and anxiety levels were assessed at baseline and after the intervention. RESULTS: Caregivers of patients with ED showed significantly higher levels of depression and anxiety than the comparison group of non‐ED caregivers. The online education program showed no significant effect on decreasing depression and anxiety levels of caregivers of patients with ED overall. Caregivers who had older loved ones and not living with them were more likely to decrease their depression levels. Caregivers of patients with longer illness duration were less likely to decrease their anxiety levels. DISCUSSION: These results showed that caregivers of ED patients suffered more serious psychological distress during the pandemic. A more structured and intensive online intervention with a limited number of participants might be required to address caregivers' distress in post‐COVID‐19 China.","Guo, Lei; Wu, Mengting; Zhu, Zhuoying; Zhang, Lei; Peng, Sufang; Li, Wei; Chen, Han; Fernández‐Aranda, Fernando; Chen, Jue",Eur Eat Disord Rev,https://doi.org/10.1002/erv.2783; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32852142/,164

660274,"Good science is good science: we need specialists, not sects",2020-06-20,"OBJECTIVES: To recognize most common patterns of upper extremity (UE) injuries in victims of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV). METHODS: Radiological review of 308 patients who reported physical IPV at our institution from January 2013 to June 2018, identified 55 patients with 88 unique UE injuries. Demographic data and injury patterns and associations were collected from the electronic medical records. RESULTS: The cohort included 49 females and 6 males (age 19–63, mean 38). At the time of injury, IPV was reported in 15/88 (17%) and IPV screening was documented for 22/88 (25%) injuries. There were 46 fractures, 8 dislocations or subluxations, and 34 isolated soft tissue injuries, most commonly involving the hand (56/88). Fractures most commonly involved the fingers (21/46, 46%) and the 5th digit (8/27, 30%). Medial UE fractures (5th digit, 4th digit) constituted 44% of hand and finger fractures (12/27) and 26% of all fractures (12/46). Comminuted and displaced fractures were rare (8/46, 17%). Head and face injuries were the most common concomitant injuries (9/22, 41%) and subsequent injuries (21/61, 35%). Of 12 patients with recurrent UE injuries, 6 had recurrent injuries of the same hand. Five of 6 non-acute fractures (83%) were of the hand. CONCLUSIONS: Hand and finger injuries are the most common UE injuries in patients with IPV, with finger being the most common site and medial hand the most common region of fracture. Repeated injuries involving the same site and a combination of medial hand and head or face injuries could indicate IPV. KEY POINTS: • Upper extremity injuries in victims of intimate partner violence are most commonly seen in the hand and fingers. • Fingers are the most common site of fracture and the medial hand is the most common region of fracture in the upper extremity in victims of intimate partner violence. • In intimate partner violence victims with upper extremity injuries, concomitant injuries and subsequent injuries are most commonly seen in the head and neck region.","Thomas, Richard; Dyer, George S.

The PUPPY Study seeks to understand the impact of COVID-19 across the quadruple aim of primary care, with particular focus on the impacts on patients without attachment to a regular provider and those with chronic health conditions. Methods: The PUPPY study builds on an existing research program exploring patient access and attachment to primary care, pivoted to adapt to the emerging COVID-19 context. We will undertake a longitudinal mixed methods study to understand critical gaps in primary care access and coordination, comparing data pre- and post-pandemic in three Canadian provinces (Quebec, Ontario, and Nova Scotia). Multiple data sources will be used including: a policy review; qualitative interviews with primary care policymakers, providers (i.e., family physicians, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists), and patients (N=120); and medication prescribing and healthcare billings. The findings will inform the strengthening of primary care during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Interpretation: This is the first study of its kind exploring the impacts of COVID-19 on primary care systems, with particular focus on the issues of patient's attachment and access to primary care.

The characterization of HLA allele frequency in the population can play an important role in determining whether HLA antigens contribute to viral susceptibility. In this regard, global efforts are currently underway to study possible correlations between HLA alleles with the occurrence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, this study examined the possible association between specific HLA alleles and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in a population from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The frequencies of HLA class I (HLA-A, -B, and -C) and HLA class II alleles (HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1); defined using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS); from 115 UAE nationals with mild, moderate, and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented here. HLA alleles and supertypes were compared between hospitalized and non-hospitalized subjects. Statistical significance was observed between certain HLA alleles and supertypes and the severity of the infection. Specifically, alleles HLA-B*51:01 and HLA-A*26:01 showed a negative association (suggestive of protection), whilst genotypes HLA-A*03:01, HLA-DRB1*15:01, and supertype B44 showed a positive association (suggestive of predisposition) to COVID-19 severity.

662410,Kinderkrankheiten sind kein Kinderspiel,2021-09-06,"INTRODUCTION Structuring patient and practice data into episodes formed the foundation of the earliest evidence base of family medicine. We aim to make patients' narratives part of the evidence base for family medicine by incorporating coded and structured information on the patient's reason to visit the family physician (FP) and adding the patient's personal and contextual characteristics to routine registration data. This documentation allows studies of relations between morbidity and elements of the patient story, providing more insight into the range of problems presented to primary care and in the patient-centeredness applied by FPs. METHODS The Dutch Practice-Based Research Network (PBRN), named FaMe-Net, is the world's oldest PBRN. Seven Dutch family practices provide regular primary care and participate in the PBRN. It contains all morbidity data of the approximately 40,000 listed patients (308,000 patient-years and 2.2 million encounters from 2005 until 2019). All information belonging to 1 health problem is ordered in 1 episode. Morbidity (diagnoses), reasons for encounter (RFE), and interventions are coded according to the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC-2). Registration occurs within the electronic health record (EHR), specially designed to facilitate the extensive registration for the PBRN. Since 2016, the network expanded routine registration with the duration of symptoms and coded personal and contextual characteristics (eg, country of birth, level of education, family history, traumatic events) obtained through the self-reported 'context survey' of listed patients. These data are added to the EHR. Registered data are extracted from the EHR and processed for scientific research.We present data on the differences in RFEs of the most prominent symptoms of COVID-19 between 2019 and 2020; the relation between the diagnosis of pneumonia and presentation of the symptom 'cough,' and how personal determinants influence the chances of final diagnoses. Lastly, we show the relation of self-reported abuse with patient's contact frequency and psychosocial problems. RESULTS Prompt introduction of registration rules brought insight into COVID-19-related symptoms early in the pandemic. In March 2020, symptoms related to COVID-19 were presented more often than in March 2019. Chronic conditions and prevention showed a collapsing contact frequency. Telephone, email, and video consultations increased from 31% to 53%.Episodes of pneumonia most frequently started with the RFE 'cough.' A combination of 'cough' and 'fever' as RFE increases the likelihood of pneumonia, as does cough in the presence of comorbid COPD among older men. The prevalence of pneumonia is higher among patients with low socioeconomic status. DISCUSSION The Dutch PBRN FaMe-Net has started to add elements of patients' narratives and context to decades of morbidity registration, creating options for a scientific approach to primary care's core values. Assumptions of 'pre/post chances' of the final diagnosis, already existing implicitly in FPs minds, can be elaborated and quantified by investigating the associations between multiple registered variables, including parts of patients' 'stories.' This way, we aim to make visible what is intuitively already known by FPs.","Luijks, Hilde; van Boven, Kees; Olde Hartman, Tim; Uijen, Annemarie; van Weel, Chris; Schers, Henk",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2021.04.200609; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34312264/,164

Management is particularly challenging in critically ill patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) level of care. Supportive care in the form of accurate volume correction and avoiding nephrotoxic agents are the chief cornerstone of the management of these patients. The pathophysiology of acute renal failure in COVID-19 is multifactorial, with significant contributions from excessive cytokine release. Gaining a better insight into the pathophysiology of renal failure will hopefully help develop more directed treatment options. A considerable number of these patients deteriorate despite adequate supportive care owing to the complexity of the disease and multi-organ involvement. Renal replacement therapy is used for a long time in critically ill septic patients who develop progressive renal failure despite adequate conservative support. Timing and choice of renal replacement therapy in critically ill COVID-19 patients remains an area of future research that may help decrease mortality in this patient population.","Raza, Ahmad; Estepa, Adrian; Chan, Vincent; Jafar, Munnam S",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32642345/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8429,164

Bottom-up mass spectrometry (MS) can identify histone PTMs, whereas intact protein analysis by MS can detect species missed by bottom-up approaches. We used a novel approach of online two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem MS with high-resolution reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), alternating electron transfer dissociation (ETD) and collision-induced dissociation (CID) on precursor ions to maximize fragmentation of uniquely modified species. The first online RPLC separation sorted histone families, then RPLC or weak cation exchange hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (WCX-HILIC) separated species heavily clad in PTMs. Tentative identifications were assigned by matching proteoform masses to predicted theoretical masses that were verified with tandem MS. We used this innovative approach for histone-intact protein PTM mapping (HiPTMap) to identify and quantify proteoforms purified from CD8 T cells after in vivo influenza infection. Activation significantly altered PTMs following influenza infection, histone maps changed as T cells migrated to the site of infection, and T cells responding to secondary infections had significantly more transcription enhancing modifications. Thus, HiPTMap identified and quantified proteoforms and determined changes in CD8 T cell histone PTMs over the course of infection.","Rezinciuc, Svetlana; Tian, Zhixin; Wu, Si; Hengel, Shawna; Pasa-Tolic, Ljiljana; Smallwood, Heather S.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33302437/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12121409,164

Understanding how these viruses enter host cells could help to develop effective therapeutics. An endosomal protein, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), has been identified as a necessary entry receptor for this process, and priming of the viral glycoprotein (GP) to a fusion-competent state is a prerequisite for NPC1 binding. Here, we have determined the crystal structure of the primed GP (GPcl) of Ebola virus bound to domain C of NPC1 (NPC1-C) at a resolution of 2.3 Å. NPC1-C utilizes two protruding loops to engage a hydrophobic cavity on head of GPcl. Upon enzymatic cleavage and NPC1-C binding, conformational change in the GPcl further affects the state of the internal fusion loop, triggering membrane fusion. Our data therefore provide structural insights into filovirus entry in the late endosome and the molecular basis for design of therapeutic inhibitors of viral entry.","Wang, Han; Shi, Yi; Song, Jian; Qi, Jianxun; Lu, Guangwen; Yan, Jinghua; Gao, George F.",Cell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26771495/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867415017080; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.12.044; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0092867415017080,164

The possible impacts of cities on seven domains of quality of life – travel, leisure, work, social relationships, residential well-being, emotional responses, and health – during COVID-19 are reviewed. Findings indicate that the role of transport and land use, urban nature, public space, facilities and services, housing, and information and communications technology (ICT) in quality of life in cities was transformed during COVID-19. Access to healthcare facilities and services and local amenities; opportunities for walking and cycling; COVID-19-secure public transport; access to a car; urban blue or green space and access to nearby nature; easy access to open public space; living in a dwelling of sufficient size and quality; private or communal outdoor areas; and ICT infrastructure and systems possibly helped to mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 on quality of life in cities. Implications for urban planning and policy arise from the COVID-19 crisis, shedding light on ways to address inequities, support vulnerable groups, and improve quality of life in cities in times of pandemics but also under normal circumstances.","Mouratidis, Kostas",Land use policy,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264837721004956; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34566233/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837721004956?v=s5,164

METHODS Adults with and without serious mental illness diagnosed as having COVID-19 in the first year of the pandemic were identified in the TriNetX database, a network of electronic health records from 49 U.S. health care systems representing 63.5 million individuals. A propensity score approach was used to compare outcomes of unmatched and matched cohorts (N=85,257). RESULTS Compared with persons without serious mental illness, persons with serious mental illness were more likely to be hospitalized or to die after COVID-19 diagnosis. No difference in mortality or use of mechanical ventilation was observed among groups admitted to the hospital with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Disparities in overall mortality after COVID-19 for persons with serious mental illness likely were driven by factors outside of acute care settings.","Murphy, Karly A; McGinty, Emma E; Daumit, Gail L",Psychiatric services,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202100151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34320825/,164

METHODS: To assess coverage of wildlife and other environmental aspects, we reviewed major health security reports (including World Organisation for Animal Health Performance of Veterinary Services reports, and World Health Organization Joint External Evaluations and follow-on National Action Plans for Health Security) published by 107 countries and territories. We extracted information on stated coverage gaps, wildlife surveillance systems and priority diseases. We also searched National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans published by 125 countries to assess whether disease surveillance or prevention activities were included. FINDINGS: We noted that the occurrence frequency of keywords indicative of wildlife, environment, biodiversity and climate factors varied with type of report and between countries. We found that more than half (57.9%, 62/107) of the reporting countries did not provide any evidence of a functional wildlife health surveillance programme. Most countries (83.2%, 89/107) indicated specific gaps in operations, coordination, scope or capacity. Only eight of the 125 countries (6.4%) publishing a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan reported tangible activities related to wildlife health or zoonotic disease. CONCLUSION: Overall, despite their importance for pandemic prevention, wildlife and environmental considerations are neglected in health security priorities and plans. Strengthening wildlife health capacity and operations should be emphasized in One Health efforts to monitor and mitigate known and novel disease risks.","Machalaba, Catherine; Uhart, Marcela; Ryser-Degiorgis, Marie-Pierre; Karesh, William B",Bull World Health Organ,https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.20.272690; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33958822/,164

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the main and interactive relationships of social support and resilience on individual mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic across three age groups: emerging adults, adults, and older adults. METHODS: A survey was conducted with 23,192 participants aged 18–85. Respondents completed a questionnaire, including items on the COVID-19-related support they perceived from different sources, the abbreviated version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and the Mental Health Inventory. RESULTS: Latent profile analysis identified five profiles of social support, and the patterns of potential profiles were similar in all groups. However, category distribution in the five profiles was significantly different among the age groups. Furthermore, analysis using the BCH command showed significant differences in mental health among these profiles. Lastly, interactive analyses indicated resilience had a positive relationship with mental health, and social support served as a buffer against the negative impact of low resilience on mental health. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides quantitative evidence for socioemotional selectivity theory (SST) and enables several practical implications for helping different age groups protecting mental health during pandemic.","Li, Fugui; Luo, Sihui; Mu, Weiqi; Li, Yanmei; Ye, Liyuan; Zheng, Xueying; Xu, Bing; Ding, Yu; Ling, Ping; Zhou, Mingjie; Chen, Xuefeng",BMC Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33413238/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-03012-1,164

METHODS: Three N95 masks of different makes (A, B and C), were subjected to 6 decontamination methods, namely UV irradiation, Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) dip, Plasma sterilization ( Sterrad®), Ethylene Oxide (ETO, 3M®), Dry heat sterilization and Moist heat sterilization. The integrity of the N95 masks were assessed by measuring their particle filtering efficiency at particle size range between 0.3 and 0.5 microns. RESULTS: All the masks decontaminated with ETO and plasma sterilization retained over 95% particle filtering efficiency. Masks decontaminated using IPA dip and Autoclaving showed a drop and UV irradiation, showed variations in particle size efficiency degradation, post decontamination. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend plasma sterilization for decontamination of N95 masks in low resource settings. ETO was not recommended due to hazards associated with handling of ethylene oxide, though the filtering efficiency was retained. Since the UV irradiation method showed variations in our results, we recommend that evaluation of UV decontamination for N95 masks needs to be done on a case-to-case basis.","Rohit, Anusha; Rajasekaran, Shankar; Shenoy, Suchitra; Rai, Sumit; I, Karunasagar; Kumar D, Suresh",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33383222/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.12.070; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220325947; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220325947?v=s5,164

They are now understood to be an integral part of the acute phase response (APR) which is the cornerstone of innate immunity. APP have been shown to be valuable biomarkers as increases can occur with inflammation, infection, neoplasia, stress, and trauma. All animals—from fish to mammals—have demonstrable APP, but the type of major APP differs by species. While the primary application of these proteins in a clinical setting is prognostication, studies in animals have demonstrated relevance to diagnosis and detection and monitoring for subclinical disease. APP have been well documented in laboratory, companion, and large animals. With the advent of standardized and automated assays, these biomarkers are available for use in all fields of veterinary medicine as well as basic and clinical research.","Cray, Carolyn",Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123945969000056; https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-394596-9.00005-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22137431/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123945969000056,164

A review,2021-07-31,"While the virus SARS-CoV-2 spreads all over the world, most countries have taken severe measures to protect their citizens and slow down the further spread of the disease COVID-19. These measures affect individuals, communities, cities, countries, and the entire planet. In this paper, we propose that the tremendous consequences of the corona crisis invite environmental psychology to focus more strongly on research questions that address major societal challenges from a collective psychology perspective. In particular, we stress that the corona crisis may affect how people appraise – and potentially respond to – the looming climate crisis. By consistently pointing out systemic links and their human factor, environmental psychology can become central to a scientific agenda of a sustainable ‘post-corona society’. In order to provide a framework for future research towards a sustainable societal transformation, we build on the Social Identity Model of Pro-Environmental Action (SIMPEA) and extend its scope to understand people's responses following the corona crisis. The model allows predictions of previously not explicitly included concepts of place attachment, nature connectedness, basic psychological needs, and systems thinking. It may serve as a guiding framework for a better understanding of the transformation towards a sustainable future.","Reese, Gerhard; Hamann, Karen R.S.; Heidbreder, Lea M.; Loy, Laura; Menzel, Claudia; Neubert, Sebastian; Tröger, Josephine; Wullenkord, Marlis C.",J Environ Psychol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2020.101444; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494420302589?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32528209/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0272494420302589,164
