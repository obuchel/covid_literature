591,591,591,A Conformation-Sensitive Monoclonal Antibody against the A2 Domain of von Willebrand Factor Reduces Its Proteolysis by ADAMTS13,15.474647,8.898515,2011-07-11,"The size of von Willebrand factor (VWF), controlled by ADAMTS13-dependent proteolysis, is associated with its hemostatic activity. Many factors regulate ADAMTS13-dependent VWF proteolysis through their interaction with VWF. These include coagulation factor VIII, platelet glycoprotein 1bα, and heparin sulfate, which accelerate the cleavage of VWF. Conversely, thrombospondin-1 decreases the rate of VWF proteolysis by ADAMTS13 by competing with ADAMTS13 for the A3 domain of VWF. To investigate whether murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human VWF affect the susceptibility of VWF to proteolysis by ADAMTS13 in vitro, eight mAbs to different domains of human VWF were used to evaluate the effects on VWF cleavage by ADAMTS13 under fluid shear stress and static/denaturing conditions. Additionally, the epitope of anti-VWF mAb (SZ34) was mapped using recombinant proteins in combination with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis. The results indicate that mAb SZ34 inhibited proteolytic cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13 in a concentration-dependent manner under fluid shear stress, but not under static/denaturing conditions. The binding epitope of SZ34 mAb is located between A1555 and G1595 in the central A2 domain of VWF. These data show that an anti-VWF mAb against the VWF-A2 domain (A1555-G1595) reduces the proteolytic cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13 under shear stress, suggesting the role of this region in interaction with ADAMTS13.","Zhang, Jingyu; Ma, Zhenni; Dong, Ningzheng; Liu, Fang; Su, Jian; Zhao, Yiming; Shen, Fei; Wang, Anyou; Ruan, Changgeng",PLoS One,216,1
711,711,711,Secretory phospholipase A2 pathway in various types of lung injury in neonates and infants: a multicentre translational study,15.758945,9.266666,2011-11-08,"BACKGROUND: Secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) is a group of enzymes involved in lung tissue inflammation and surfactant catabolism. sPLA2 plays a role in adults affected by acute lung injury and seems a promising therapeutic target. Preliminary data allow foreseeing the importance of such enzyme in some critical respiratory diseases in neonates and infants, as well. Our study aim is to clarify the role of sPLA2 and its modulators in the pathogenesis and clinical severity of hyaline membrane disease, infection related respiratory failure, meconium aspiration syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome. sPLA2 genes will also be sequenced and possible genetic involvement will be analysed. METHODS/DESIGN: Multicentre, international, translational study, including several paediatric and neonatal intensive care units and one coordinating laboratory. Babies affected by the above mentioned conditions will be enrolled: broncho-alveolar lavage fluid, serum and whole blood will be obtained at definite time-points during the disease course. Several clinical, respiratory and outcome data will be recorded. Laboratory researchers who perform the bench part of the study will be blinded to the clinical data. DISCUSSION: This study, thanks to its multicenter design, will clarify the role(s) of sPLA2 and its pathway in these diseases: sPLA2 might be the crossroad between inflammation and surfactant dysfunction. This may represent a crucial target for new anti-inflammatory therapies but also a novel approach to protect surfactant or spare it, improving alveolar stability, lung mechanics and gas exchange.","De Luca, Daniele; Capoluongo, Ettore; Rigo, Vincent",BMC Pediatr,216,1

Prompt recognition and treatment of this disorder can abrogate otherwise high fatality associated with this disorder. A 2 year old girl presented with acute enteritis, developed prolonged fever and organomegaly complicated by multi-organ failure. She fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis including bone marrow evidence of haemophagocytosis. In addition she had serological evidence of tubercular infection as well as a positive family history of tuberculosis. She responded rapidly to immunosuppressive therapy and anti-tubercular therapy.

This study was designed to find non-invasive biomarkers for fibrosis in a clinical context where this process occurs rapidly, HCV-positive patients who underwent liver transplantation (LT). We analyzed 93 LT patients with HCV recurrence, 41 non-LT patients with liver disease showing a fibrosis stage F≥1 and 9 patients without HCV recurrence who received antiviral treatment before LT, as control group. Blood obtained from 16 healthy subjects was also analyzed. Serum samples were fractionated by ion exchange chromatography and their proteomic profile was analyzed by SELDI-TOF-MS. Characterization of the peptide of interest was performed by ion chromatography and electrophoresis, followed by tandem mass spectrometry identification. Marked differences were observed between the serum proteome profile of LT patients with early fibrosis recurrence and non-recurrent LT patients. A robust peak intensity located at 5905 m/z was the distinguishing feature of non-recurrent LT patients. However, the same peak was barely detected in recurrent LT patients. Similar results were found when comparing samples of healthy subjects with those of non-LT fibrotic patients, indicating that our findings were not related to either LT or HCV infection. Using tandem mass-spectrometry, we identified the protein peak as a C-terminal fragment of the fibrinogen α chain. Cell culture experiments demonstrated that TGF-β reduces α-fibrinogen mRNA expression and 5905 m/z peak intensity in HepG2 cells, suggesting that TGF-β activity regulates the circulating levels of this protein fragment. In conclusion, we identified a 5.9 kDa C-terminal fragment of the fibrinogen α chain as an early serum biomarker of fibrogenic processes in patients with liver disease.","Marfà, Santiago; Crespo, Gonzalo; Reichenbach, Vedrana; Forns, Xavier; Casals, Gregori; Morales-Ruiz, Manuel; Navasa, Miquel; Jiménez, Wladimiro",PLoS One,216,17
1963,1963,1963,Seronegative Celiac Disease and Immunoglobulin Deficiency: Where to Look in the Submerged Iceberg?,15.463994,9.038395,2015-09-08,"In the present narrative review, we analyzed the relationship between seronegative celiac disease (SNCD) and immunoglobulin deficiencies. For this purpose, we conducted a literature search on the main medical databases. SNCD poses a diagnostic dilemma. Villous blunting, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) count and gluten “challenge” are the most reliable markers. Immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence tissue transglutaminase (tTG)-targeted mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) immune complexes in the intestinal mucosa of SNCD patients may be useful. In our experience, tTG-mRNA was similarly increased in seropositive celiac disease (CD) and suspected SNCD, and strongly correlated with the IELs count. This increase is found even in the IELs’ range of 15–25/100 enterocytes, suggesting that there may be a “grey zone” of gluten-related disorders. An immune deregulation (severely lacking B-cell differentiation) underlies the association of SNCD with immunoglobulin deficiencies. Therefore, CD may be linked to autoimmune disorders and immune deficits (common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)/IgA selective deficiency). CVID is a heterogeneous group of antibodies dysfunction, whose association with CD is demonstrated only by the response to a gluten-free diet (GFD). We hypothesized a familial inheritance between CD and CVID. Selective IgA deficiency, commonly associated with CD, accounts for IgA-tTG seronegativity. Selective IgM deficiency (sIgMD) is rare (<300 cases) and associated to CD in 5% of cases. We diagnosed SNCD in a patient affected by sIgMD using the tTG-mRNA assay. One-year GFD induced IgM restoration. This evidence, supporting a link between SNCD and immunoglobulin deficiencies, suggests that we should take a closer look at this association.","Giorgio, Floriana; Principi, Mariabeatrice; Losurdo, Giuseppe; Piscitelli, Domenico; Iannone, Andrea; Barone, Michele; Amoruso, Annacinzia; Ierardi, Enzo; Di Leo, Alfredo",Nutrients,216,17
3576,3576,3576,Impact of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency on dengue infection in Myanmar children,15.653337,8.808836,2019-01-02,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency may affect the clinical presentation of dengue due to the altered redox state in immune cells. We aimed to determine the association between G6PD deficiency and severity of dengue infection in paediatric patients in Myanmar. A cross-sectional study was conducted among paediatric patients aged 2–13 years with dengue in Yankin Children Hospital, Myanmar. One hundred and ninety-six patients positive for dengue infection, as determined via PCR or ELISA, were enrolled. Dengue severity was determined according to the 2009 WHO classification guidelines. Spectrophotometric assays determined G6PD levels. The adjusted median G6PD value of males in the study population was used to define various cut-off points according to the WHO classification guidelines. G6PD genotyping for Mahidol, Kaiping and Mediterranean mutations was performed for 128 out of 196 samples by real-time multiplex PCR. 51 of 196 (26.0%) patients had severe dengue. The prevalence of G6PD phenotype deficiency (< 60% activity) in paediatric patients was 14.8% (29/196), specifically, 13.6% (14/103) in males and 16.2% (15/93) in females. Severe deficiency (< 10% activity) accounted for 7.1% (14/196) of our cohort, occurring 11.7% (12/103) in males and 2.2% (2/93) in females. Among 128 samples genotyped, the G6PD gene mutations were detected in 19.5% (25/128) of patients, with 20.3% (13/ 64) in males and 18.8% (12/64) in females. The G6PD Mahidol mutation was 96.0% (24/25) while the G6PD Kaiping mutation was 4.0% (1/25). Severe dengue was not associated with G6PD enzyme deficiency or presence of the G6PD gene mutation. Thus, no association between G6PD deficiency and dengue severity could be detected.

4413,4413,4413,"Patient characteristics, clinical manifestations, prognosis, and factors associated with gastrointestinal cytomegalovirus infection in immunocompetent patients",15.561642,9.121535,2020-01-30,"BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) cytomegaloviral (CMV) infection is common among patients with immunocompromised status; however, data specific to GI-CMV infection in immunocompetent patients are comparatively limited. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with GI-CMV infection at Siriraj Hospital (Bangkok, Thailand) during 2008–2017. Baseline characteristics, presentations, comorbid conditions, endoscopic findings, treatments, and outcomes were compared between immunocompetent and immunocompromised. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-three patients (56 immunocompetent, 117 immunocompromised) were included. Immunocompetent patients were significantly older than immunocompromised patients (73 vs. 48.6 years, p < 0.0001). Significantly more immunocompetent patients were in the ICU at the time of diagnosis (21.0% vs. 8.6%, p = 0.024). GI bleeding was the leading presentation in immunocompetent, while diarrhea and abdominal pain were more common in immunocompromised. Blood CMV viral load was negative in significantly more immunocompetent than immunocompromised (40.7% vs. 12.9%, p = 0.002). Ganciclovir was the main treatment in both groups. Significantly more immunocompetent than immunocompromised did not receive any specific therapy (25.5% vs. 4.4%, p ≤ 0.01). Six-month mortality was significantly higher among immunocompetent patients (39.0% vs. 22.0%, p = 0.047). Independent predictors of death were old age and inpatient or ICU clinical setting. Treatment with antiviral agents was the only independent protective factor. CONCLUSION: GI-CMV infection was frequently observed among immunocompetent elderly patients with comorbidities or severe concomitant illnesses. GI bleeding was the most common presentation. Blood CMV viral load was not diagnostically helpful. Significantly higher mortality was observed in immunocompetent than in immunocompromised patients, but this could be due to more severe concomitant illnesses in the immunocompetent group.","Chaemsupaphan, Thanaboon; Limsrivilai, Julajak; Thongdee, Chenchira; Sudcharoen, Asawin; Pongpaibul, Ananya; Pausawasdi, Nonthalee; Charatcharoenwitthaya, Phunchai",BMC Gastroenterol,216,1

The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and clinical impact of severe hematological abnormalities in patients with confirmed influenza virus infection. This was an observational retrospective study including all adult patients with diagnosis of influenza virus infection hospitalized from January to May 2016 in our institution. Influenza virus infection was diagnosed by means of rRT-PCR assay performed on respiratory samples. Poor outcome was defined as a composite endpoint in which at least one of the following criteria had to be fulfilled: (a) respiratory failure, (b) SOFA ≥2, or (c) death. Two hundred thirty-nine patients were included. Applying the HLH-04 criteria for the diagnosis of hemophagocytic syndrome, cytopenias (hemoglobin ≤9 g/dl, platelets <100,000/μl or neutrophils <1,000/μl) were present in 51 patients (21%). Patients with hematological abnormalities showed higher SOFA scores, respiratory failure, septic shock and in-hospital mortality than the remaining patients. The composite endpoint was present in 33.3% in the cytopenias group vs. 13.3% in the group without cytopenias (p=0.001). In a multivariate analysis, variables associated with the composite endpoint were: use of steroids prior to present admission (OR: 0.12; 95% CI: 0.015–0.96, p=0.046), presence of any hematological abnormality (OR: 3.54; 95% CI:1.66–7.51, p= 0.001), and LDH>225 U/l (OR:4.45; CI:1–19.71, p=0.049).

Many cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases use JAKs and STATs to transduce intracellular signals. Mutations in JAK and STAT genes cause a number of immunodeficiency syndromes, and polymorphisms in these genes are associated with autoimmune diseases. The success of small-molecule JAK inhibitors (Jakinibs) in the treatment of rheumatologic disease demonstrates that intracellular signaling pathways can be targeted therapeutically to treat autoimmunity. Tofacitinib, the first rheumatologic Jakinib, is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for rheumatoid arthritis and is currently under investigation for other autoimmune diseases. Many other Jakinibs are in preclinical development or in various phases of clinical trials. This review describes the JAK–STAT pathway, outlines its role in autoimmunity, and explains the rationale/pre-clinical evidence for targeting JAK–STAT signaling. The safety and clinical efficacy of the Jakinibs are reviewed, starting with the FDA-approved Jakinib tofacitinib, and continuing on to next-generation Jakinibs.

In the medical field, recombinant LAB expressing pathogenic antigens at different cellular locations have been used to elicit both mucosal and systemic immune responses. Expression–secretion vectors (ESVs) with a signal peptide (SP) are pivotal for protein expression and secretion. In this study, the genome sequence of Lactobacillus casei ATCC334 was explored for new SPs using bioinformatics tools. Three new SPs of the proteins Cwh, SurA and SP6565 were identified and used to construct an ESV based on our Escherichia coli–L. casei shuttle vector, pRCEID-LC13.9. Functional testing of these constructs with the green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene showed that they could secrete the GFP. The construct with CwhSP showed the highest GFP secretion. Consequently, CwhSP was selected to develop an ESV construct carrying a synthetic gene encoding the extracellular domain of the matrix 2 protein fused with the hepatitis B core antigen (M2e:HBc). This ESV was shown to efficiently express and secrete the M2e:HBc fusion protein.

9565,9565,9565,Content analysis of systematic reviews on the effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine,15.464917,9.199548,2013-09-13,"Monensin, a monovalent ion-selective ionophore, facilitates the transmembrane exchange of principally sodium ions for protons. The outer surface of the ionophore-ion comples is composed largely of nonpolar hydrocarbon, which imparts a high solubility to the complexes in nonpolar solvents. In biological systems, these complexes are freely soluble in the lipid components of membranes and, presumably, diffuse or shuttle through the membranes from one aqueous membrane interface to the other. The net effect for monensin is a trans-membrane exchange of sodium ions for protons. However, the interaction of an ionophore with biological membranes, and its ionophoric expression, is highly dependent on the biochemical configuration of the membrane itself. One apparent consequence of this exchange is the neutralization of acidic intracellular compartments such as the trans Golgi apparatus cisternae and associated elements, lysosomes, and certain endosomes. This is accompanied by a disruption of trans Golgi apparatus cisternae and of lysosome and acidic endosome function. At the same time, Golgi apparatus cisternae appear to swell, presumably due to osmotic uptake of water resulting from the inward movement of ions. Monensin effects on Golgi apparatus are observed in cells from a wide range of plant and animal species. The action of monensin is most often exerted on the trans half of the stacked cisternae, often near the point of exit of secretory vesicles at the trans face of the stacked cisternae, or, especially at low monensin concentrations or short exposure times, near the middle of the stacked cisternae. The effects of monensin are quite rapid in both animal and plant cells; i.e., changes in Golgi apparatus may be observed after only 2–5 min of exposure. It is implicit in these observations that the uptake of osmotically active cations is accompanied by a concomitant efflux of H(+) and that a net influx of protons would be required to sustain the ionic exchange long enough to account for the swelling of cisternae observed in electron micrographs. In the Golgi apparatus, late processing events such as terminal glycosylation and proteolytic cleavages are most susceptible to inhibition by monensin. Yet, many incompletely processed molecules may still be secreted via yet poorly understood mechanisms that appear to bypass the Golgi apparatus. In endocytosis, monensin does not prevent internalization. However, intracellular degradation of internalized ligands may be prevented. It is becoming clear that endocytosis involves both acidic and non-acidic compartments and that monensin inhibits those processes that normally occur in acidic compartments. Thus, monensin, which is capable of collapsing Na(+) and H(+) gradients, has gained wide-spread acceptance as a tool for studying Golgi apparatus function and for localizing and identifying the molecular pathways of subcellular vesicular traffic involving acid compartments. Among its advantages are the low concentrations at which inhibitions are produced (0.01–1.0 μM), a minimum of troublesome side effects (e.g., little or no change of protein synthesis or ATP levels) and a reversible action. Because the affinity of monensin for Na(+) is ten times that for K(+), its nearest competitor, monensin mediates primarily a Na(+)-H(+) exchange. Monensin has little tendency to bind calcium. Not only is monensin of importance as an experimental tool, it is of great commercial value as a coccidiostat for poultry and to promote more efficient utilization of feed in cattle. The mechanisms by which monensin interact with coccidia and rumen microflora to achieved these benefits are reasonably well documented. However, the interactions between monensin and the tissues of the host animal are not well understood although the severe toxicological manifestations of monensin poisoning are well known. Equine species are particularly susceptible to monensin poisoning, and a common effect of monensin poisoning is vacuolization and/or swelling of mitochondria in striated muscle. Other pathological injuries to striated muscle, spleen, lung, liver and kidney also have been noted. A consistent observation is cardiac myocyte degeneration as well as vacuolization. Differences in cellular response resulting from exposure to monensin (i.e., Golgi apparatus swelling in cultured cells, isolated tissues, and plants vs.mitochondrial swelling in animals fed monensin) suggest that myocardial damage is due either to a monensin metabolite or is a secondary response to some other derivation. However, as pointed out by Bergen and Bates [26], the underlying mode of action of ionophores is on transmembrane ion fluxes which dissipate cation and proton gradients. Consequently, some or all of the observed monensin effects in vivo in animals could be secondary phenomena caused by disruption of normal membrane physiology resulting from altered ion fluxes.","Mollenhauer, Hilton H.; James Morré, D.; Rowe, Loyd D.",,216,19

Biocompatibility of the fabricated scaffold increased significantly by incorporating curcumin in the scaffold fibers, where protein adsorption, cell attachment, and viability were increased in the nanofiber/curcumin group compared with the other groups. In addition, the expression level of smooth muscle cell-related genes, including alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), smooth muscle 22 alpha (SM-22a), Caldesmon1, and Calponin1in the stem cells upregulated while cultured in the presence of curcumin, but this increase was significantly improved while cells cultured on the nanofibers/curcumin. In addition, αSMA protein in the cells cultured on the nanofibers/curcumin expressed significantly higher than those cells cultured on the nanofibers without curcumin. It can be concluded that smooth muscle cell differentiation of the induced pluripotent stem cells promoted by curcumin and this promotion was synergistically improved while curcumin incorporated in the nanofibers.

It is thought that a relatively short duration antibiotic regimen given once in a lifetime would not significantly increase overall antibiotic consumption. However, this would mean offering antibiotic treatment to the majority of the population in countries with the biggest burden of gastric cancer who would, therefore, have the greatest benefit from such a strategy. So far, no country has implemented an eradication strategy. With an example based on the current situation in Latvia, we have estimated the increase in antibiotic consumption if the screen-and-treat strategy was applied. Depending on the scenario that might be chosen, clarithromycin consumption would increase up to sixfold, and amoxicillin consumption would double if the recommendations of the current guideline in the local circumstances was applied. It appears that an increase in commonly used antibiotic consumption cannot be justified from the viewpoint of antibiotic stewardship policies. Solutions to this problem could be the use of antibiotics that are not required for treating life-threatening diseases or more narrow selection of the target group, e.g. young people before family planning to avoid transmission to offspring. Additional costs related to the increase in resistome should be considered for future cost-effectiveness modelling of the screen-and-treat strategy.","Leja, Mārcis; Dumpis, Uga",Dig Dis Sci,216,1

Proper structure selection makes inhibitor construction more economic, as the development process typically consists of multiple iterative preparation/bioassay steps. On the basis of these principles, using noncomplex computation and modeling methodologies, we comprehensively screened 900 commercial precursors of the P1′ residues of phosphinic dipeptide and dehydrodipeptide analogs to identify the most promising ligands of 52 metallo-dependent aminopeptidases with known crystal structures. The results revealed several nonproteinogenic residues with an improved energy of binding compared with the best known inhibitors. The data are discussed taking into account the selectivity and stereochemical implications of the enzymes. Using this approach, we were able to identify nontrivial structural elements substituting the recognized phosphinic peptidomimetic scaffold of metallo-aminopeptidase inhibitors.","Talma, Michał; Mucha, Artur",Biomolecules,216,17

This study aims to analyze the usage of palliative care and life-sustaining treatments among ED triage level I resuscitation patients based on a nationally representative sample of patients in Taiwan. METHODS: A matched-pair retrospective cohort study was conducted to examine the association between palliative care and outcome variables using multivariate logistic regression and Kaplan–Meier survival analyses. Between 2009 and 2013, 336 ED triage level I resuscitation patients received palliative care services (palliative care group) under a universal health insurance scheme. Retrospective cohort matching was performed with those who received standard care at a ratio of 1:4 (usual care group). Outcome variables included the number of visits to emergency and outpatient departments, hospitalization duration, total medical expenses, utilization of life-sustaining treatments, and duration of survival following ED triage level I resuscitation. RESULTS: The mean survival duration following level I resuscitation was less than 1 year. Palliative care was administered to 15% of the resuscitation cohort. The palliative care group received significantly less life-sustaining treatment than did the usual care group. CONCLUSION: Among patients who underwent level I resuscitation, palliative care was inversely correlated with the scope of life-sustaining treatments. Furthermore, triage level I resuscitation status may present a possible new field for starting palliative care intervention and reducing low-value care.","Lin, Chih-Yuan; Lee, Yue-Chune",BMC Palliat Care,216,1

Despite all of the achievements in medical management and non-pharmacological therapy that improve the outcome in HF, new strategies are needed to prevent HF-related hospitalisations by keeping stable HF patients out of the hospital and focusing resources on unstable HF patients. Remote monitoring of these patients could provide the physicians with an additional tool to intervene adequately and promptly. Results of telemonitoring to date are inconsistent, especially those of telemonitoring with traditional non-haemodynamic parameters. Recently, the CardioMEMS device (Abbott Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA), an implantable haemodynamic remote monitoring sensor, has shown promising results in preventing HF-related hospitalisations in chronic HF patients hospitalised in the previous year and in New York Heart Association functional class III in the United States.

It displays both orexigenic and anabolic properties via ghrelin mimetic activity and transient increases in growth hormone (GH). However, increasing GH and insulin-like growth factor-1 in cancer patients raises concerns of potentially stimulating tumor growth. Therefore, we investigated the effect of ghrelin and anamorelin on tumor growth in a murine NSCLC xenograft model. METHODS: Female nude mice (15–21/group) with established A549 tumors were administered ghrelin (2 mg/kg i.p.), anamorelin (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg p.o.), or vehicle controls daily for 28 days. Tumor growth, food consumption, and body weight were monitored. Murine growth hormone (mGH) and murine insulin-like growth factor-1 (mIGF-1) were measured in plasma. RESULTS: Tumor growth progressed throughout the study, with no significant differences between treatment groups. Daily food consumption was also relatively unchanged, while the percentage of mean body weight gain at the end of treatment was significantly increased in animals administered 10 and 30 mg/kg compared with controls (p < 0.01). Peak mGH levels were significantly higher in ghrelin- and anamorelin-treated animals than in controls, while peak mIGF-1 levels were slightly elevated but not statistically significant. All regimens were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that neither anamorelin nor ghrelin promoted tumor growth in this model, despite increased levels of mGH and a trend of increased mIGF-1. Together with anamorelin’s ability to increase body weight, these results support the clinical development of ghrelin receptor agonist treatments for managing NSCLC-related anorexia/cachexia.","Northrup, R.; Kuroda, K.; Duus, E.

Campylobacteriosis, a typical food-borne disease, can range from mild symptoms to fatal illness. About 550 million people worldwide suffer from campylobacteriosis and lethality is about 33 million p.a. This review summarizes the state of the current knowledge on Campylobacter with focus on its specific virulence factors. Using this knowledge, multifactorial prevention strategies can be implemented to reduce the prevalence of Campylobacter in the food chain. In particular, antiadhesive strategies with specific adhesion inhibitors seem to be a promising concept for reducing Campylobacter bacterial load in poultry production. Antivirulence compounds against bacterial adhesion to and/or invasion into the host cells can open new fields for innovative antibacterial agents. Influencing chemotaxis, biofilm formation, quorum sensing, secretion systems, or toxins by specific inhibitors can help to reduce virulence of the bacterium. In addition, the unusual glycosylation of the bacterium, being a prerequisite for effective phase variation and adaption to different hosts, is yet an unexplored target for combating Campylobacter sp. Plant extracts are widely used remedies in developing countries to combat infections with Campylobacter. Therefore, the present review summarizes the use of natural products against the bacterium in an attempt to stimulate innovative research concepts on the manifold still open questions behind Campylobacter towards improved treatment and sanitation of animal vectors, treatment of infected patients, and new strategies for prevention. KEY POINTS: • Campylobacter sp. is a main cause of strong enteritis worldwide. • Main virulence factors: cytolethal distending toxin, adhesion proteins, invasion machinery. • Strong need for development of antivirulence compounds.","Kreling, Vanessa; Falcone, Franco H.; Kehrenberg, Corinna; Hensel, Andreas",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,216,17

They are under-represented in clinical research including tumour molecular analysis. The aim of Arcagen is to generate a multinational database integrating clinical and molecular information of patients with rare cancers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present the retrospective feasibility cohort of patients with rare cancers, with previously collected tumour samples available from any stage. Molecular analysis was performed using FoundationOne CDx for all histologies except for sarcoma where FoundationOne Heme was used. Clinical data including demographic data, medical history, malignant history, treatment and survival data were collected. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients from three centres were screened; molecular data were obtained for 77 patients (41 sarcomas, 9 yolk sac tumours, 14 rare head and neck cancers, 13 thymomas). The median age at the time of diagnosis was 48 (range 28–85). Most patients had reportable genomic alterations (89%). The most common alterations were linked to cell cycle regulation (TP53, RB1, CDKN2A/B deletions and MDM2 amplification). Multiple activating single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) could be detected in the RAS/RAF family. The tumour mutational burden status was globally low across all samples with a median of 3 Muts/MB (range 0–52). Only 4 cases (ie, 4.7% of tumours) had direct actionable mutations for a treatment approved in Europe within the patient’s tumour type.

However, due to their systemic toxicity they also exert dangerous side effects associated mainly with cardiovascular risks. The pathway that is currently often developed is their chemical and physical modification via formation of conjugated or complexed prodrug systems with a variety of nanocarriers that can selectively release the active species in cancer cells. In this study, six new nanoconjugates were synthesized with the use of polyhedral oligosilsesquioxanes [POSS(OH)(32)] as nanocarriers of the anticancer drugs anthracyclines—doxorubicin (DOX) and daunorubicin (DAU). These prodrug conjugates are also equipped with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) moieties of different structure and molecular weight. Water-soluble POSS, succinic anhydride modified (SAMDOX and SAMDAU) with carboxylic function, and PEGs (PEG1, PEG2 and PEGB3) were used for the synthesis. New nanoconjugates were formed via ester bonds and their structure was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy ((1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, (1)H-(13)C HSQC, DOSY and (1)H-(1)H COSY), FTIR and DLS. Drug release rate was evaluated using UV-Vis spectroscopy at pH of 5.5. Release profiles of anthracyclines from conjugates 4–9 point to a range of 10 to 75% (after 42 h). Additionally, model NMR tests as well as diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) confirmed formation of the relevant prodrugs. The POSS-anthracycline conjugates exhibited prolonged active drug release time that can lead to the possibility of lowering administered doses and thus giving them high potential in chemotherapy. Drug release from conjugate 7 after 42 h was approx. 10%, 33% for conjugate 4, 47% for conjugate 5, 6, 8 and 75% for conjugate 9.","Piorecka, Kinga; Kurjata, Jan; Stanczyk, Wlodzimierz A.",Molecules,216,1

This complexity can make it difficult for surgeons to determine appropriate treatment plans independently. At our institution, final decisions regarding treatment for patients are made at multidisciplinary meetings, termed High-Risk Conferences, led by the Patient Safety Committee. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we assessed the reasons for convening High-Risk Conferences, the final decisions made and treatment outcomes using conference records and patient medical records for conferences conducted at our institution from April 2010 to March 2018. RESULTS: A total of 410 High-Risk Conferences were conducted for 406 patients during the study period. The department with the most conferences was cardiovascular surgery (24%), and the reasons for convening conferences included the presence of severe comorbidities (51%), highly difficult surgeries (41%) and nonmedical/personal issues (8%). Treatment changes were made for 49 patients (12%), including surgical modifications for 20 patients and surgery cancellation for 29. The most common surgical modification was procedure reduction (16 patients); 4 deaths were reported. Follow-up was available for 21 patients for whom surgery was cancelled, with 11 deaths reported. CONCLUSIONS: Given that some change to the treatment plan was made for 12% of the patients discussed at the High-Risk Conferences, we conclude that participants of these conferences did not always agree with the original surgical plan and that the multidisciplinary decision-making process of the conferences served to allow for modifications. Many of the modifications involved reductions in procedures to reflect a more conservative approach, which might have decreased perioperative mortality and the incidence of complications as well as unnecessary surgeries. High-risk patients have complex issues, and it is difficult to verify statistically whether outcomes are associated with changes in course of treatment. Nevertheless, these conferences might be useful from a patient safety perspective and minimize the potential for legal disputes.","Koike, Masayoshi; Yoshimura, Mie; Mio, Yasushi; Uezono, Shoichi",BMC Anesthesiol,216,1

Our aim was to investigate the magnitude and duration of risk for arterial and venous thrombosis following discharge after respiratory infection. Patients with respiratory infections were identified using the United States Nationwide Readmission Database from 2012 to 2014. Patients admitted with asthma or cellulitis served as comparators. Readmissions for acute myocardial infarction (MI) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) were evaluated at 30 to 180 days. The likelihood of a first thrombotic event after discharge was compared with a 30-day period prior to hospitalization. Among 5,271,068 patients discharged after a respiratory infection, 0.56% and 0.78% were readmitted within 30-days with MI and VTE, respectively. Relative to asthma and cellulitis, respiratory infection was associated with a greater age and sex-adjusted hazard of 30-day readmission for MI (adjusted HR [aHR] 1.48 [95% CI 1.42–1.54] vs. asthma; aHR 1.36 [95% CI 1.31–1.41] vs. cellulitis) and VTE (aHR 1.28 [95% CI 1.24–1.33] vs. asthma; aHR 1.26, [95% CI 1.22–1.30] vs. cellulitis).

The main active ingredient of turmeric is curcumin, a polyphenol that helps prevent and control neurological, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases and some cancers. However, curcumin has drawbacks such as low water-solubility, poor absorption, fast metabolism, quick systemic elimination, low bioavailability, poor pharmacokinetics, low stability, and low penetration targeting efficacy. To overcome these drawbacks, a common method used is encapsulating curcumin in nanocarriers for targeted delivery. However, the degraded products of nanocarriers have raised concerns. In this research, we synthesized nanoparticles of curcumin, nanocurcumin without using nanocarriers. To do so, curcumin was soxhlet extracted from raw turmeric rhizome. The stock solutions of different curcumin concentrations prepared in dichloromethane were added to boiling water at different flow rates and sonicated for different time intervals. An average particle size of 82 ± 04 nm was obtained with 5.00 mg/mL stock solution concentration, at 0.10 mL/min flow rate and 30 min sonication time. The particle size tends to increase with the flow rate and the concentration of curcumin in the stock solution but decreases with the sonication time. X-ray diffraction shows sharp and intense diffraction peaks for curcumin, indicating its identity and high crystallinity, but nanocurcumins are amorphous. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy spectra confirm the presence of all the functional groups of curcumin in nanocurcumin. Transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy images show the perfectly spherical morphology of nanocurcumin. Although curcumin is not water-soluble, nano-curcumin formulations are freely dispersible in water.","Hettiarachchi, Sandhuli S.; Dunuweera, Shashiprabha P.; Dunuweera, Asiri N.; Rajapakse, R. M.

Regeneration of functional periodontal soft (periodontal ligament and gingiva) and hard tissue components (cementum and alveolar bone) to replace lost tissues is the ultimate goal of periodontal treatment, but clinically predictable treatments are lacking. Similarly, the identification of biomarkers that can be used to accurately diagnose periodontitis activity is lacking.

Traditional methods of treatment for prostate cancer produce obvious side effects and a high recurrence rate. Cancer stem cells are considered to be a group of cells that determine the proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance of tumor. Prostate cancer therapy based on microRNAs and prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs) has been a research hot spot in this field. Previous studies have reported that miR-197 plays an important role in the occurrence and development of prostate cancer, but the molecular mechanism of miR-197 on the development of prostate cancer has not been reported yet. In this study, we verified that miR-197 is significantly overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues and prostate cancer cells. Then, we verified that miR-197 expression affects the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of prostate cancer cells by regulating integrin subunit alpha V (ITGAV) expression through STAT5 pathway, and the results indicated that the miR-197 inhibitor can be a prostate cancer suppressor. Then we synthesized the AbCD133@GNR@MSNs@miR-197 inhibitor drug carrier, in which 35.42 μg of the miR-197 inhibitor could be loaded in 1 mg of AbCD133@GNR@MSNs. The AbCD133@GNR@MSNs@miR-197 inhibitor demonstrated good photothermal properties and photothermal controlled-release properties. The modified CD133 antibodies on the surface of the nano drug carrier helped more drug carriers to enter the PCSCs. The pharmacodynamic effects of the AbCD133@GNR@MSNs@miR-197 inhibitor on PCSCs in vivo and in vitro were studied under near-infrared radiation. The results showed that the AbCD133@GNR@MSNs@miR-197 inhibitor prepared in this study could not only significantly suppress the development of PCSCs through ITGAV/STAT5 pathway but also significantly suppress the growth of PCSC solid tumors. In short, our study verified that miR-197 regulates the development of PCSCs through STAT5 pathway by targeting ITGAV, and the AbCD133@MSNs@GNR@miR-197 inhibitor could be a potential suppressor used in prostate cancer treatment. In short, our study found that miR-197 affected the development of prostate cancer by regulating ITGAV. The AbCD133@GNR@MSNs@miR-197 inhibitor prepared in this study could suppress the development and growth of PCSCs in vitro and in solid tumors not only by targeting the ITGAV but also through photothermal therapy. Our study not only provides a theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of prostate cancer but also provides a research scheme of drug loading and microRNA-based photothermal controlled therapy for prostate cancer.","Ju, Guanqun; Zhu, Yingjian; Du, Tao; Cao, Wanli; Lin, Jianhai; Li, Chun; Xu, Dongliang; Wang, Zhijun",Front Cell Dev Biol,216,22

The present study envisaged in silico molecular docking as well as in vitro antimicrobial efficacy screening of identified phytochemical ligands to the dispersin (aap) and outer membrane osmoporin (OmpC) domains of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) and non-typhoidal Salmonella spp. (NTS), respectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The evaluation of drug-likeness, molecular properties, and bioactivity of the identified phytocompounds (thymol, carvacrol, and cinnamaldehyde) was carried out using Swiss ADME, while Protox-II and StopTox servers were used to identify its toxicity. The in silico molecular docking of the phytochemical ligands with the protein motifs of dispersin (PDB ID: 2jvu) and outer membrane osmoporin (PDB ID: 3uu2) were carried out using AutoDock v.4.20. Further, the antimicrobial efficacy of these compounds against multi-drug resistant EAEC and NTS strains was determined by estimating the minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations. Subsequently, these phytochemicals were subjected to their safety (sheep and human erythrocytic haemolysis) as well as stability (cationic salts, and pH) assays. RESULTS: All the three identified phytochemicals ligands were found to be zero violators of Lipinski’s rule of five and exhibited drug-likeness. The compounds tested were categorized as toxicity class-4 by Protox-II and were found to be non- cardiotoxic by StopTox. The docking studies employing 3D model of dispersin and ompC motifs with the identified phytochemical ligands exhibited good binding affinity. The identified phytochemical compounds were observed to be comparatively stable at different conditions (cationic salts, and pH); however, a concentration-dependent increase in the haemolytic assay was observed against sheep as well as human erythrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: In silico molecular docking studies provided useful insights to understand the interaction of phytochemical ligands with protein motifs of pathogen and should be used routinely before the wet screening of any phytochemicals for their antibacterial, stability, and safety aspects.

The aim of the present study was to analyze changes and determinants of LV geometry after 1 year of antihypertensive treatment in children with primary hypertension (PH) in relation to metabolic abnormalities and anthropometrical parameters. In 86 children (14.1 ± 2.4 years) with newly diagnosed PH, LV geometry and biochemical parameters before and after 12 months of standard antihypertensive therapy were assessed. At baseline, normal LV geometry (NG) was found in 42 (48.9%), concentric remodeling (CR) in 4 (4.6%), concentric hypertrophy (CH) in 8 (9.3%), and eccentric hypertrophy (EH) in 32 (37.2%) patients. The prevalence of NG in patients with severe hypertension was significantly lower than in patients with ambulatory hypertension. There were no differences in dipping status in relation to LV geometry. Patients with CH and EH were more viscerally obese than patients with NG. Patients with CH had higher diastolic blood pressure in comparison with EH patients (p < 0.05). The main predictor of relative wall thickness (RWT) was the triglycerides to high density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL) ratio (R(2) = 0.319, β = 0.246, p = 0.004). Patients received 12 months of antihypertensive treatment, either lifestyle modification only (n = 37) or lifestyle modification plus antihypertensive medications (n = 49) if severe ambulatory hypertension or target organ damage were present. After 12 months of treatment the prevalence of EH (37.2% vs 18.6%, p = 0.003) decreased but prevalence of CH did not change. Patients in whom RWT decreased also decreased waist circumference and TG/HDL; the main predictor of RWT decrease was a decrease of the TG/HDL ratio (β = 0.496, R(2) = 0.329, p = 0.002). In adolescents with PH, LV geometry is related to central obesity and insulin resistance. Decrease of abdominal obesity and insulin resistance are the most important predictors of normalization of LV geometry, however CH has lower potential to normalize LV geometry.

With improved medical care, a large proportion of these patients survive into adulthood. Longitudinal follow-up data regarding the management of kidney disease in these children is lacking. Twelve VACTERL patients with CKD stage 2–5 and 12 age-matched controls with similar urologic anomalies and CKD [mean follow-up period 15.0 ± 1.4 (SE) and 11.9 ± 2.1 years, respectively] were identified in a single center. Eight VACTERL patients progressed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) compared to four controls (66.7 vs. 33.3%, respectively). Six VACTERL patients were dialyzed pre-transplant. Of the four patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), three had to be switched to hemodialysis due to complications, whereas two of the three controls on PD did not experience significant problems. Seven VACTERL patients underwent renal transplantation compared to four controls. Mean creatinine clearance 2 years post-transplant was 65.8 ± 6.3 in VACTERL patients vs. 87.8 ± 7.1 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) in controls (p = 0.03). VACTERL patients had a significantly lower mean height standard deviation score than the controls (−2.34 ± 0.41 vs. −1.27 ± 0.24, respectively; p < 0.05). Based on these results, VACTERL patients with CKD develop ESRD more frequently, experience more complications with dialysis, may have a poorer transplant outcome, and have more severe growth failure than controls.","Ahn, Sun-Young; Mendoza, Stanley; Kaplan, George; Reznik, Vivian",Pediatr Nephrol,216,1

There is anecdotal evidence of successful induction and maintenance of remission with the monoclonal anti-IL-17A antibody secukinumab. Inhibition of IL-17A could therefore represent a potential new therapeutic option for the treatment of GCA. METHODS: This is a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, phase II study in which patients, treating physicians, and the associated clinical staff as well as the sponsor clinical team are blinded. It is designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of secukinumab compared to placebo in combination with an open-label prednisolone taper regimen. Patients included are naïve to biological therapy and have newly diagnosed or relapsing GCA. Fifty patients are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 300 mg secukinumab or placebo subcutaneously at baseline, weeks 1, 2 and 3, and every 4 weeks from week 4. Patients in both treatment arms receive a 26-week prednisolone taper regimen. The study consists of a maximum 6-week screening period, a 52-week treatment period (including the 26-week tapering), and an 8-week safety follow-up, with primary and secondary endpoint assessments at week 28. Patients who do not achieve remission by week 12 experience a flare after remission or cannot adhere to the prednisolone tapering will enter the escape arm and receive prednisolone at a dose determined by the investigator’s clinical judgment. The blinded treatment is continued. Two optional imaging sub-studies are included (ultrasound and contrast-media enhanced magnetic resonance angiography [MRA]) to assess vessel wall inflammation and occlusion before and after treatment. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients in sustained remission until week 28 in the secukinumab group compared to the proportion of patients in the placebo group. A Bayesian approach is applied. DISCUSSION: The trial design allows the first placebo-controlled data collection on the efficacy and safety of secukinumab in patients with GCA.

Currently, there is no pharmacological therapy for this condition. Studies indicate, however, that both beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) increase muscle function in patients with cancer and in older adults. The purpose of this study was to determine whether HMB and/or EPA administration would increase diaphragm and quadriceps strength in mechanically ventilated patients. METHODS: Studies were performed on 83 mechanically ventilated patients who were recruited from the Medical Intensive Care Units at the University of Kentucky. Diaphragm strength was assessed as the trans-diaphragmatic pressure generated by supramaximal magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation (PdiTw). Quadriceps strength was assessed as leg force generated by supramaximal magnetic femoral nerve stimulation (QuadTw). Diaphragm and quadriceps thickness were assessed by ultrasound. Baseline measurements of muscle strength and size were performed, and patients were then randomized to one of four treatment groups (placebo, HMB 3 gm/day, EPA 2 gm/day and HMB plus EPA). Strength and size measurements were repeated 11 days after study entry. ANCOVA statistical testing was used to compare variables across the four experimental groups. RESULTS: Treatments failed to increase the strength and thickness of either the diaphragm or quadriceps when compared to placebo. In addition, treatments also failed to decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation after study entry. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that a 10-day course of HMB and/or EPA does not improve skeletal muscle strength in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients. These findings also confirm previous reports that diaphragm and leg strength in these patients are profoundly low. Additional studies will be needed to examine the effects of other anabolic agents and innovative forms of physical therapy. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01270516.

This retrospective chart review of children at a medical college found that from August 2009 to July 2017, 855 children aged 3 months to 15 years had H1N1 influenza of whom 310 (36.3%) were admitted and 29 (9.4% admissions) died. In 2009–12, 76.5% patients presented in August–October but from 2015 to 2017, 89.3% came in January–March. The proportion of under-fives increased from 54.0% in 2009–10 to 77.7% in 2015–17. Among admitted children, 82.6% were under 5 years, 96.1% had respiratory symptoms and 11% had seizures. Six children had encephalopathy of whom four died; two survivors had severe neurological sequelae. Other features included gastroenteritis, otitis media, myositis and hepatitis. Complications included shock (10.7%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (6.1%). Evidence of bacterial/fungal infection was present in 71 (22.9%). Oxygen was required by 123 children (39.7%), high-dependency/intensive care by 47 (15.2%), 17 (5.5%) received high-flow oxygen and 29 (9.4%) required mechanical ventilation. There were no significantly increased odds of needing intensive care or of dying in children with underlying diseases or among different age groups but those with underlying central nervous system (CNS) diseases had higher odds of needing high-dependency/intensive care [odds ratio (OR) 2.35, p = 0.046]. Significantly, children with CNS symptoms had nearly seven times higher odds of needing mechanical ventilation (OR 6.85, p < 0.001) and over three times higher odds of dying (OR 3.31, p = 0.009). : Lay summary H1N1 Influenza (“swine flu”) emerged as a global pandemic in 2009 and continues to affect children all over the world. This review of records from a medical college hospital in southern India found that 855 children aged 3 months to 15 years came with H1N1 influenza over 8 years from August 2009 to July 2017. In 2009-12, over three-quarters of them presented in the rainy season but from 2015-17, almost 90% came in the winter and spring, suggesting a change in the seasonality of the outbreaks, which could impact the choice of dates for annual influenza vaccination. The proportion under 5 years of age increased from 54% in 2009-10 to 78% in 2015-17, suggesting possible immunity in children exposed to earlier outbreaks. Over a third of the children needed admission of whom almost 40% needed oxygen, one-sixth needed high-dependency/intensive care and 1 in 11 admitted children died, emphasizing the severity of this disease. While most children had respiratory symptoms, all organs of the body were affected; 11% of those admitted had seizures and 6 had encephalitis. Children admitted with central nervous system symptoms had an almost 7-fold higher risk of needing high-dependency/intensive care and an over 3-fold higher risk of dying.","Ghosh, Urmi; Bharathy, R V Nirubhan; Prasad, D Jayavelu Hariram; Moorthy, Mahesh; Verghese, Valsan Philip",J Trop Pediatr,216,22

Recently, we demonstrated that, in C4‐deficient (C4 def.) mice, IgM‐containing immune complexes (IgM‐IC) are filtered by the splenic barrier of marginal zone macrophages (MZM), resulting in an increased immune response against antigens within these IgM‐IC, but this could not be observed in wildtype or C3 def. mice. We hypothesized that splenic CD11b(+) MZM play an important role in the induction of autoimmunity, and we therefore analysed their cytokine profile after isolation with the help of magnetic antibody cell sorting. mRNA was isolated, and real‐time PCR was performed with specific primers for murine IFN‐γ (IFN‐γ), interleukin‐12 (IL‐12) and IFN‐α (IFN‐α). We observe a moderate increase of IL‐12 and IFN‐γ mRNA in CD11b(+) cells of C4 def. mice compared to wildtype cells. Surprisingly, the concentration of IFN‐α mRNA is six times higher in C4 def. mice. Preliminary results suggest that mRNA in CD11b(+) cells of C3 def. mice is even lower than that in wt. Six hours following i.v. application of 20 µg of a murine monoclonal IgM anti‐dsDNA antibody, production of IL‐12, IFN‐γ and IFN‐α mRNA is increased in CD11b(+) cells of both C4 def. and wt mice. Several references described increased levels of INF‐α in patients with SLE. Dendritic cells are discussed as a major source of IFN‐α. Our observation that C4‐deficient, SLE‐susceptible mice demonstrate an increased spontaneous IFN‐α production by splenic CD11b(+) marginal zone macrophages could be an early sign and a trigger for the development of SLE. This is supported by the fact that the absence of C3 is not a predisposing factor for SLE and our observation that C3 def. animals display low levels of IFN‐α mRNA.","Finke, D.; Hoerster, R.; Brockmann, C.; Kropf, K.; Hennig, H.; Zawatzky, R.; Goerg, S.",Scand J Immunol,216,1

Consistent conventions in verification projects based on proof assistants, such as Coq, increase in importance as projects grow in size and scope. While conventions can be documented and enforced manually at high cost, emerging approaches automatically learn and suggest idiomatic names in Java-like languages by applying statistical language models on large code corpora. However, due to its powerful language extension facilities and fusion of type checking and computation, Coq is a challenging target for automated learning techniques. We present novel generation models for learning and suggesting lemma names for Coq projects. Our models, based on multi-input neural networks, are the first to leverage syntactic and semantic information from Coq ’s lexer (tokens in lemma statements), parser (syntax tree s), and kernel (elaborated terms) for naming; the key insight is that learning from elaborated terms can substantially boost model performance. We implemented our models in a toolchain, dubbed Roosterize, and applied it on a large corpus of code derived from the Mathematical Components family of projects, known for its stringent coding conventions. Our results show that Roosterize substantially outperforms baselines for suggesting lemma names, highlighting the importance of using multi-input models and elaborated terms.","Nie, Pengyu; Palmskog, Karl; Li, Junyi Jessy; Gligoric, Milos",Automated Reasoning,216,1

In the present work, the dynamics of such spreading was evaluated by the analysis of the growth factor of the disease. METHOD: It was applied the space phase of the time series, the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) of the series, and the fractal dimension of the space phase. RESULTS: It was possible to notice a strange attractor in the space phase of the growth factor indicating that the process is a deterministic chaos. The value of the alpha coefficient by DFA showed to be less than 0.5, characteristic of anti-persistent long-range memory, in which large events alternate with small events, and vice-versa.

It typically involves two meta-levels: one includes meta-models that describe modelling languages, and the other contains models built by instantiating those meta-models. Multi-level modelling generalizes this approach by allowing models to span an arbitrary number of meta-levels. A scenario that profits from multi-level modelling is the definition of language families that become specialized by successive refinements at subsequent meta-levels, hence promoting language reuse. This enables an open set of variability options for the possible specializations of a given language. However, multi-level modelling lacks the ability to express closed variability regarding the supported language primitives and their realizations. This limits the reuse opportunities of a language family. To improve this situation, we propose a novel combination of product lines with multi-level modelling to cover both open and closed variability. Our proposal is backed by a formal theory that guarantees correctness, and is implemented atop the MetaDepth multi-level modelling tool.","de Lara, Juan; Guerra, Esther",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,216,17

METHODS: Hospitalizations with acute ischemic stroke and EVT were identified using validated codes in the National Inpatient Sample (2010–2015). The primary outcome was prolonged mechanical ventilation defined as ventilation ≥ 96 consecutive hours. We compared hospitalizations involving prolonged ventilation following EVT with those that did not involve prolonged ventilation. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for differences between groups. Clinical predictors of prolonged ventilation were assessed using multivariable conditional logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Among the 34,184 hospitalizations with EVT, 5087 (14.9%) required prolonged mechanical ventilation. There was a decline in overall intubation and prolonged ventilation during the study period. On multivariable analysis, history of heart failure [OR 1.28 (95% CI 1.05–1.57)] and diabetes [OR 1.22 (95% CI 1–1.50)] was independent predictors of prolonged ventilation following EVT. In a sensitivity analysis of anterior circulation stroke only, heart failure [OR 1.3 (95% CI 1.10–1.61)], diabetes [OR 1.25 (95% CI 1.01–1.57)], and chronic lung disease [OR 1.31 (95% CI 1.03–1.66)] were independent predictors of prolonged ventilation. The weighted proportions of in-hospital mortality, post-procedural shock, acute renal failure, and intracerebral hemorrhage were higher in the prolonged ventilation group. CONCLUSIONS: Among a nationally representative sample of hospitalizations, nearly one-in-six patients had prolonged mechanical ventilation after EVT. Heart failure and diabetes were significantly associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation following EVT. Prolonged ventilation was associated with significant increase in in-hospital mortality and morbidity.

Her family circumstances and the role the children’s schools played in that story merit consideration by educators, school leaders and education policy makers. Informed by theories of everyday cultural practices and sociological studies of gendered power relations in education, we argue that gender politics and organisational strategies for keeping parents ‘in their place’ can significantly contribute to systemic failures and school cultures that reinscribe the effects of family violence.","Saltmarsh, Sue; Tualaulelei, Eseta; Ayre, Kay",Aust Educ Res,216,1

In order to further explore the formation mechanism of career success of nurses, we conducted our study using the Kaleidoscope Career Model to explore the chain-mediating effects of cognitive emotion regulation and social support between self-identity and career success. Five hundred forty-seven infection control nurses from nine different hospitals participated in the study and completed questionnaires on the self-identity, cognitive emotion regulation, social support, and career success scales. The results from structural equation modeling reveal that self-identity has a positive effect on positive emotion regulation and social support and a negative impact on negative emotion regulation. Positive (negative) emotion regulation has a positive (negative) effect on social support. All antecedents have a positive impact on career success except negative emotion regulation, which has a negative one. Bootstrap analysis shows that the relationship between self-identity and career success is partially mediated by the chain of cognitive emotion regulation and social support. Overall, our research sheds light on the mechanism of self-identity on career success of nurses.

But how would the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic curve have changed had these same dollars been allocated to proven preventive interventions? METHODS: Performance and activity metrics on all COVID-19 related TV ads that have aired in the U.S. between February 26(th) and June 7(th), 2020, were provided by iSpot.tv, Inc., including expenditures. COVID-19 incidence and mortality data were collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Descriptive statistics were performed to calculate total TV ad expenditures and other performance metrics across industry categories. Leveraging a previously published stochastic agent-based model that was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions to control COVID-19, the number of cases that would have been prevented had these same dollars been used for preventive interventions was calculated using cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs), the cost divided by cases prevented. RESULTS: A total of 1,513 companies purchased TV airtime during the study period, totaling approximately 1.1 million airings, 215.5 billion impressions, and $2.7 billion in expenditures; most of the expenditures were spent by the restaurant (15.9%), electronics and communications (15.4%), and vehicle (13.7%) industries. The CERs for PPE and social distancing measures were $13,856 and $29,552, respectively; therefore, had all of these TV ad dollars instead been allocated to PPE or social distancing measures, approximately 194,908 and 91,386 cases of COVID-19 may have been prevented by the end of the study period, respectively. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] Figure 2. COVID-19 cases prevented had TV ad expenditures been reallocated for interventions. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Americans were inundated with COVID-19 related TV ads during the early months of the pandemic and companies are now showing some signs to relent. In times of disaster, however, it is paramount that the private sector go beyond showcasing their empathy and truly become socially responsible by allocating their funds to proven prevention and control measures.

Several methods exist in research and industry to assess the security level of an organization, from manual activities to automated attack graphs.

In this paper, we provide a methodology to support the assessor in the task of evaluating the coverage of cybersecurity controls coming from technical standards, regulations, internal practices. This is done by providing him/her with a multi-layer model that takes into account several organizational layers, a mapping procedure to tie the security controls to the multi-layer model, and the definition of a validation factor that can be used to possibly refine the level of coverage and to suggest possible layers where evidences should be collected to verify and assess the coverage of a security control.

The textile fibers were produced by the incorporation of flame-retardant bridged 9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide (DOPO) derivative (PHED) in the PA6 matrix during the in situ polymerization process at concentrations equal to 10 and 15 wt% (PA6/10PHED and PA6/15PHED, respectively). Whilst the nanodispersed PHED provided highly efficient flame retardancy, its biological activity led to excellent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as excellent antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans. The results confirmed leaching of the PHED, but the tested leachates did not cause any measurable toxic effect to the duckweed Lemna minor. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the leached PHED from the PA6/15PHED sample was confirmed for human cells from adipose tissue in direct and prolonged contact. The targeted biological activity of the organophosphinate flame retardant could be beneficial for the development of PA6 textile materials with multifunctional properties and the low ecotoxicity profile, while the PHED’s leaching and cytotoxicity limit their application involving the washing processes and direct contact with the skin.","Vasiljević, Jelena; Štular, Danaja; Kalčíková, Gabriela; Zajc, Janja; Šobak, Matic; Demšar, Andrej; Tomšič, Brigita; Simončič, Barbara; Čolović, Marija; Šelih, Vid Simon; Jerman, Ivan",Polymers (Basel),216,24

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is a multi-expressed glycoprotein that is speculated to be a functional SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Previous studies remain controversial regarding whether DPP-4 use is associated with reduced risk for COVID-19 diabetic patients. Thus, this meta-analysis is performed. Method: A comprehensive literature search on PubMed was conducted to identify all relevant studies published prior to October 2020. This meta-analysis was reported in conformity to the Preferred Reporting Project declared by the Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). The quality assessment was performed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Random-effect model or fixed-effect model was used based on heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses were performed based on types of diabetes, geographic locations, study designs, and different sample sizes. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias detection were also performed. All statistical analyses were performed using RevMan and STATA 12.0 statistical software, and all P values were two-tailed, the test level was 0.05. Result: 69 articles were obtained. 5 articles involving 49,989 participants were included. All included studies were considered moderate to high quality. No decreased mortality of COVID-19 diabetic patients was found among DPP-4 users (OR 0.86, 95%CI: 0.22,3.41, P=0.083, I(2)=81%). In the subgroup analysis, studies in Asia (OR 3.11, 95%CI: 0.78, 12.34, P=0.001, I(2)=70%) did not found reduced mortality, whereas studies in Europe (OR 0.36, 95%CI: 0.23, 0.56, P<0.00001, I(2)=0%) were associated with reduced mortality. Based on study designs, the four case-control studies (OR 1.27, 95%CI: 0.27, 5.93, P=0.76, I(2)=89%) did not find reduced mortality, but one cohort study (OR 0.13, 95%CI: 0.02, 0.84, P=0.03) showed a reduced mortality. The four studies investigating Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) did found reduced mortality (OR 0.74, 95%CI: 0.13, 4.24, P=0.73, I(2)=90%). For sample size >200, reduced risk of mortality (OR 0.28, 95%CI: 0.07, 1.15, P=0.08, I(2)=32%) was found, however, for sample ≤200, no statistically significant association (OR 1.44, 95%CI: 0.23, 8.89, P=0.70, I(2)=93%) was found. Sensitivity analysis by changing models and omitting each study at a time confirm the stability of the result. Begg’s test (z=-0.24, P=1.000) and Egger’s test (t=0.56, P=0.618) did not detect a significant risk of publication bias. Conclusion: The current meta-analysis did not find reduced mortality for COVID-19 diabetic patients who take DPP-4. However, subgroup-analyses found reduced mortality in Europe. More high-quality original studies are needed to further explore the association between DPP-4 use and the mortality risk of COVID-19.","Sun, Chenyu; Kim, Keun Young; Ahmed, Mubashir Ayaz; Manem, Reveena; Bhan, Chandur; Cheng, Ce",J Endocr Soc,216,16

This study reports on an inquiry into 16 Chinese EFL teachers’ feedback changes during the pandemic, with a focus on whether and how the teachers changed their feedback practice when a range of digital assessment tools and online instructional technologies were introduced to them. Data were gathered through semi-structured interviews and artifacts, including the course materials and screen recordings of teaching in online virtual classrooms. A qualitative and interpretive analysis reveals three patterns of changes in the teachers’ feedback-giving practice. The first pattern was positive changes in the teachers’ feedback-giving motivation, design, and awareness of the relational nature of teacher feedback, and the second pattern was reduction in formative feedback activities, difficulties in securing student response, and increased physical and emotional feedback workload. The third pattern was unchanged, underpinned by a conception of feedback as information transmission. A range of factors influencing such changes, including student readiness to uptake feedback, were also revealed. The findings highlight the importance of teacher feedback literacy in mediating the changes and call for attention to how constructive feedback-giving practices can be better supported.","Jiang, Lianjiang; Yu, Shulin",Asia-Pacific Edu Res,216,1

Evidence for 76 economies and 1995–2019 indicates that some other major developed economies also enjoy an exorbitant privilege, though without suffering an exorbitant duty. By contrast, most developing economies neither have an exorbitant privilege nor benefit from wealth transfers. Developing economies as a group recorded negative return differentials and valuation losses during 2010–2019, implying a total return differential of about minus three percentage points between developing and developed economies and an annual average resource transfer from developing economies of about $800bn, or 3.3 per cent of their GDP.

Studies on the association of COVID-19 outcomes and immunomodulating therapies, are scarce. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a population-based study investigating the outcomes of COVID-19 among patients with UC and CD in Denmark. METHODS: The Danish COVID-19 IBD Database is an extensive population-based database that prospectively monitors the disease course of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 among patients with UC and CD in Denmark. Severe COVID-19 was defined as COVID-19 necessitating intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, or death. Regression analysis was adjusted for age, sex, disease type, disease activity, cardiovascular disease, and corticosteroids. RESULTS: The study recruited 363 patients (UC: 223; CD: 140) from January 28(th), 2020, to February 7(th), 2021. A total of 36 (16.1%) and 18 (12.9%) patients with UC and CD, respectively, required a COVID-19 related hospitalization, while eight (3.6%) and three (2.1%) patients required intensive care treatment. Death due to COVID-19 was observed among eight (3.6%) and two (1.4%) patients, respectively. The association between these outcomes and IBD-related treatment is presented in Table 1. As shown, none of the IBD-related medications were associated with severe COVID-19 in univariate and adjusted analysis. However, systemic steroids were found to be associated with the risk of COVID-19 related hospital admission among patients with UC (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=6.54 (95% CI 1.09-36.39)) and CD (aOR=5.45 (95% CI 2.07-12.24)). [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: This ongoing Danish population-based study on COVID-19 outcomes among patients with UC and CD demonstrated severe COVID-19 among only a minority of patients, which was not associated with IBD-related medications.

There is a rapid decline in their yield due to severe soil degradation. Thus, high commercial fertilizer inputs are crucial, though they remain expensive and inaccessible to resource poor farmers. We investigated the comparative performance of composted black soldier fly frass fertilizer (BSFFF), conventionally composted brewer's spent grain (BSG), commercial organic fertilizer (Evergrow), and mineral [nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK)] fertilizer on growth, yield, N use efficiency, and nutritional quality (crude protein, crude fiber, crude fats, ash, and carbohydrate concentrations) of tomatoes, kales, and French beans under greenhouse and open-field conditions for two seasons. The fertilizers were applied at rates equivalent to 371 kg of N ha(−1). For each crop, the plots were treated with sole rates of BSFFF, BSG, Evergrow, and NPK to supply 100% of the N required. Additional treatments included a combination of BSFFF and NPK, and BSG and NPK so that each fertilizer supplies 50% of the N required. The control treatment consisted of unfertilized soil. Results show that vegetable yields achieved using a combination of BSFFF and NPK were 4.5, 2.4, and 5.4-folds higher than the yield from the control treatment for tomatoes, kales, and French beans, respectively. The combined application of BSFFF and NPK produced 22–135%, 20–27%, and 38–50% higher yields than sole NPK for tomatoes, kales, and French beans, respectively, under both greenhouse and open-field conditions. The highest agronomic N use efficiency was achieved in sole BSFFF-treated plots compared to sole BSG and Evergrow. The N taken up by the vegetables was significantly higher when BSFFF and NPK were integrated. Vegetables grown using a combination of BSFFF and NPK had the highest crude protein and ash concentrations. Our findings demonstrate that the integration of BSFFF and NPK in vegetable cropping systems at the recommended rate of 1.24 t ha(−1) BSFFF and 322 kg ha(−1) NPK would improve soil health, boost yield, and nutritional quality of vegetable crops.","Anyega, Abel O.; Korir, Nicholas K.; Beesigamukama, Dennis; Changeh, Ghemoh J.; Nkoba, Kiatoko; Subramanian, Sevgan; van Loon, Joop J.

However, church-based religious communication has rarely been explored in this perspective. This in mind, the paper explores the YouTube channel “Jana believes”, a pioneering and also controversial project sponsored by the Evangelical Church in Germany. The argumentation proceeds in five steps. First, Hubert Knoblauch’s concept of “popular religion” is interlinked with the practical-theological perspective of “communicating the Gospel” as well as with more recent approaches to the mediatization of religion. Then characteristic elements and video genres of YouTube communication as part of popular culture are explicated. Against this background, the distinct profile of the YouTube channel “Jana believes” is outlined, with specific regard to the vlog genre. Subsequently, the interplay between popular religion, communicating the Gospel and mediatization of religion is explored in a more in depth-analysis of two exemplary video sequences. Finally, the summary brings together both sides of the interplay in question: On the one hand, the channel videos are designed according to established standards of personalized YouTube communication. In line with the concept of popular religion, the boundaries between private and public become fluid. Public communication of the Gospel is constituted by sharing what is private in life and faith. On the other hand, in the case of this channel the subjective enactment of faith is also shaped and transformed by the involvement of the church. Particularly regarding questions of authenticity and authority, the tension between popular religion and communicating the Gospel at times leads to potentially conflictual negotiation processes.","Kühn, Jonathan; Simojoki, Henrik",Z Religion Ges Polit,216,20

BIO 203 is a required course in the biology and biochemistry majors and in the pre‐health curriculum, and undergraduates typically register for BIO 203 in their sophomore year. Since Fall 2015, BIO 203 has been offered in two formats, traditional PowerPoint‐based lectures presented twice per week (80 min / session) in a 570‐seat auditorium with individual fixed seats and a flipped, active‐learning format delivered once per week (113 min / session) in a 250‐seat auditorium with shared desks and rotating chairs. Students in both sections had equal access to prerecorded lectures and online activities (content quizzes, journal activities and thought questions). The focus of the lecture section was content delivery while the flipped section emphasized active group learning facilitated by instructors and experienced undergraduate teaching assistants. Student learning was evaluated by performance on common high‐stakes multiple choice exams. On average, students in the flipped section exhibited better performance on the common exams than students in the lecture section (Fall 2019 exam total, p < 0.05 in two sample t test and Wilcoxon rank sum test). As a result of the COVID‐19 pandemic, Stony Brook University required large‐enrollment courses to switch to online instruction starting in March 2020 and continuing through the Fall 2020 semester. The BIO 203 instructors implemented a synchronous online version of BIO 203 based on the active‐learning curriculum developed for the flipped section. In Fall 2020, this synchronous online version of BIO 203 was offered simultaneously to two sections. Students in both sections had access to the same online resources (recorded lectures, content quizzes and activities) and were evaluated using low‐stakes quizzes (administered during scheduled class time) and a common cumulative final exam (administered during a common final exam period). The primary difference between the two sections was the frequency and duration of the synchronous online meetings with instructors and teaching assistants. Section 01 (595 students) met twice a week for 80 min per session, whereas section 02 (257 students) met once a week for 130 min. A preliminary analysis of the scores on the common final exam indicates that students in section 01 (two meetings per week) performed better than students in section 02 (1 meeting per week) (p < 0.05 in two sample t test and Wilcoxon rank sum test). These preliminary findings are consistent with the hypothesis that student learning is enhanced by frequent engagement in active learning.","Collins, William; Watson, Robert; Vasudevan, Erin",FASEB J,216,1

However, many sources of data remain siloed, unstructured, and/or unavailable for complementary and secondary research. Sysrev was developed to address these issues. First, Sysrev was built to aid in systematic evidence reviews (SER), where digital documents are evaluated according to a well defined process, and where Sysrev provides an easy to access, publicly available and free platform for collaborating in SER projects. Secondly, Sysrev addresses the issue of unstructured, siloed, and inaccessible data in the context of generalized data extraction, where human and machine learning algorithms are combined to extract insights and evidence for better decision making across disciplines. Sysrev uses FAIR - Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets - as primary principles in design. Sysrev was developed primarily because of an observed need to reduce redundancy, reduce inefficient use of human time and increase the impact of evidence based decision making. This publication is an introduction to Sysrev as a novel technology, with an overview of the features, motivations and use cases of the tool. Methods: Sysrev. com is a FAIR motivated web platform for data curation and SER. Sysrev allows users to create data curation projects called “sysrevs” wherein users upload documents, define review tasks, recruit reviewers, perform review tasks, and automate review tasks. Conclusion: Sysrev is a web application designed to facilitate data curation and SERs. Thousands of publicly accessible Sysrev projects have been created, accommodating research in a wide variety of disciplines.

Air pollution is also associated with increased mortality, primarily mediated by cardiopulmonary diseases. Observations at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic showed that mortality from COVID-19 was increased, especially in regions with higher levels of air pollution. The influence of air pollution on the course of the disease in COVID-19 is unclear. METHOD: A selective literature search of studies up to the beginning of April 2021 was carried out in PubMed on the association between air pollution and COVID-19 mortality using the search terms “air pollution AND/OR COVID-19/coronavirus/SARS-CoV‑2 AND/OR mortality”. RESULTS: Current research shows that around 15% of global COVID-19 deaths are due to air pollution. The proportion of COVID-19 deaths from air pollution is 19% in Europe, 17% in North America and 27% in East Asia. This role of air pollution in COVID-19 deaths has now been confirmed by various studies from the USA, Italy and England. Air pollution and COVID-19 result in similar damage to the cardiopulmonary system, which may explain the link between air pollution and increased COVID-19 mortality. CONCLUSION: The environmental aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic shown here calls for greater efforts to be made towards effective measures to reduce anthropogenic emissions, which cause both air pollution and climate change.","Münzel, Thomas; Hahad, Omar; Pozzer, Andrea; Lelieveld, Jos",Kardiologe,216,1

This study aimed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of organised regular self-testing for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This was a mixed methods observational cohort study in asymptomatic students and staff at University of Oxford, who performed SARS-CoV-2 antigen lateral flow self-testing. Data on uptake and adherence, acceptability, and test interpretation were collected via a smartphone app, an online survey, and qualitative interviews. FINDINGS: Across three main sites, 551 participants (25% of those invited) performed 2728 tests during a follow-up of 5.6 weeks. 447 participants (81%) completed at least two, and 340 (62%) completed at least four tests. The survey, completed by 214 participants (39%), found that 98% of people were confident to self-test and believed self-testing to be beneficial. Acceptability of self-testing was high, with 91% of ratings being acceptable or very acceptable. 2711 (99.4%) test results were negative, nine were positive and eight were inconclusive. Results from eighteen qualitative interviews with students and staff revealed that participants valued regular testing, but there were concerns about test accuracy that impacted uptake and adherence.

However, the status and role of the ACE2-Ang-(1-7) axis in human PAH is incompletely understood. METHODS We studied 85 patients with a diagnosis of PAH of distinct etiologies. Fifty-five healthy blood donors paired for age and sex served as controls. Blood samples were obtained from the pulmonary artery in patients with PAH during right heart catheterisation. Peripheral blood was obtained for both groups. Ang-(1-7) and angiotensin II (AngII) were measured by zone capillary electrophoresis. Aldosterone, Angiotensin-(1-9), Angiotensin A, (Ang-A) and ACE2 were measured by ELISA, and ACE2 activity was determined enzymatically. RESULTS Of the 85 patients, 47 had idiopathic PAH, 25 had PAH-associated with congenital heart disease, and 13 had PAH-associated with collagen vascular disease. Compared to controls, patients with PAH had a higher concentration of AngII [(1.03(IQR 0.72-1.88) versus 0.19(IQR 0.10-0.37)pmoles·mL-1;p<0.001)] and of aldosterone [(88.7(58.7-132) versus 12.9(9.55-19.9)ng·dL-1;p<0.001)]. Conversely, PAH patients had a lower concentration of Ang-(1-7) than controls [(0.69(0.474-0.91) versus 4.07(2.82-6.73)pmoles·mL-1;p<0.001)], and a lower concentration of Ang-(1-9), and Ang-A. Similarly, the ACE2 concentration was higher than in controls [(8.7(5.35-13.2) versus 4.53(1.47-14.3)ng·mL-1;p=0.011)], whereas the ACE2 activity was significantly reduced [(1.88(1.08-2.81) versus 5.97(3.1-17.8)nmoles·mL-1;p<0.001)]. No significant differences were found among the three different etiologic forms of PAH. CONCLUSIONS The AngII-ACE2-Ang- (1-7) axis appears to be altered in human PAH and we propose that this imbalance, in favour of AngII, plays a role in the pathogenesis of the severe PAH.

The study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ERAS in single-incision laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (SIDG). MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 90 patients who received laparoscopic gastric cancer resection were divided into 3 groups: group A (n=30), underwent traditional multiport laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with conventional perioperative management; group B (n=30) underwent traditional multiport laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with ERAS concept; and group C (n=30), underwent SIDG with ERAS concept. Clinical data and gut function were assessed in 3 groups. RESULTS There were no significant differences in terms of postoperative complication, number of resected lymph nodes and blood loss among 3 groups. However, operation time was longer (P=0.003) and treatment cost was higher (P<0.001) in group C than that in group A and B. Group C had faster recovery of bowel function (P<0.001), shorter postoperative hospital stay (P=0.002), and less postoperative complication (P=0.044) than those in group A. There were no significant differences in terms of recovery of bowel function and postoperative hospital stay between group C and B (all P>0.05). The white blood cell counts were lower than group A and B (all P<0.05) and C-reactive protein in group C were lower than group A (P<0.05) and B (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that SIDG with ERAS may be a feasible and safe procedure for early gastric cancer because it provides a favorable cosmetic result while not compromising postoperative complications, number of resected lymph nodes, and blood loss.","Zhou, Junfeng; He, Qingliang; Wang, Jiaxing; Liu, Qicai; Wang, Mi","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",216,16

Our objective was to examine national trends in mortality following MT. METHODS We analyzed the National Inpatient Sample (2012) and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2008-2011) for patients with a primary diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke that received MT. Temporal trends in mortality were examined using Spearman's rank correlation. To account for confounding factors, mortality was further analyzed in binary logistic regression. RESULTS Hospitals performing MT comprised 8% of all hospitals treating ischemic stroke. The percentage of stroke cases treated with MT increased from 0.6% of cases in 2008 to 1.1% in 2012, totaling 16 307 MT cases in a 5 year period. Inhospital mortality decreased over the study period from 25.4% in 2008 to 16.1% in 2012 (r=-0.081, p<0.001). This finding was supported by regression analysis as each incremental year reduced the odds of mortality by 20% (OR=0.832, p<0.001). Administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was associated with a decrease in the odds of mortality (OR=0.805, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Utilization of MT represents a small percentage of stroke cases, although the trend is increasing. Mortality following MT has been showing a steady decline over the past 5 years. This may be a result of a learning curve, improved patient selection, and/or device improvements. Randomized trials remain essential to evaluate the potential benefit of endovascular devices and identify the most appropriate patients.","Villwock, Mark R; Padalino, David J; Deshaies, Eric M",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,216,5

To date, there is no significant exact medication is available to treat Covid-19 as a result both the death toll and the number of people affecting by this disease is increasing every day. 35 phytochemicals having antiviral properties were taken to get the best compounds against Nsp1 Materials and Methods: As no PDB structure of this protein is available, homology modeling was done to predict the probable structure. After homology modeling, the best model was taken according to C-score and TM- score and then validated by using different web servers. After validation, docking of these compounds was done using AutoDock vina, vega zz, and PyRx and consensus docking score was considered to select molecules after docking. Finally, the orbitals energy calculation of these compounds was done to check their activity and the binding interaction of these molecules were also analyzed. RESULTS Molecules having a consensus score of -8kcal/mol or more negative were kept for further study and it was seen that 16 molecules had the given criteria. Then drug-likeness filtration was done according to Lipinski's rule of five and 11 molecules remained. Out of these 11 molecules, 5 molecules had satisfactory ADMET properties. Calculation of orbital energy revealed their activity. CONCLUSION It is expected that this research might be helpful for the development of new antiviral drugs active against SARS-CoV-2 targeting Nsp1.","Hossain, Alamgir",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,216,11

As part of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS), a national longitudinal study of health and well-being, subjects (N = 265) (i) completed a phone-based interview that assessed generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder symptoms at enrollment, (ii) participated in a one-week actigraphy study 9-14 years later, and (iii) completed a long-term follow-up, phone-based interview to quantify generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder symptoms 17-18 years from initial enrollment. A deep auto-encoder paired with a multi-layered ensemble deep learning model was leveraged to predict whether participants experienced increased anxiety disorder symptoms across this 17-18 year period. RESULTS Out-of-sample cross-validated results suggested that wearable movement data could significantly predict which individuals would experience symptom deterioration (AUC = 0.696, CI [0.598, 0.793], 84.6% sensitivity, 52.7% specificity, balanced accuracy = 68.7%). CONCLUSIONS Passive wearable actigraphy data could be utilized to predict long-term deterioration of anxiety disorder symptoms. Future studies should examine whether these methods could be implemented to prevent deterioration of anxiety disorder symptoms.","Jacobson, Nicholas C; Lekkas, Damien; Huang, Raphael; Thomas, Natalie",Journal of affective disorders,216,1

However, few reports have evaluated the dynamic wall motion of aneurysms due to the cardiac cycle. The objective of this study was to quantify cardiac cycle-related volume changes in aneurysms using 4-dimensional CT angiography. METHODS Four-dimensional CT angiography was performed in 18 patients. Image data of 1 cardiac cycle were divided into 10 phases and the volume of the aneurysm was then quantified in each phase. These data were also compared with intracranial vessels of normal appearance. RESULTS The observed cardiac cycle-related volume changes were in good agreement with the sizes of the aneurysms and normal vessels. The cardiac cycle-related volume changes of the intracranial aneurysms and intracranial normal arteries were 5.40%±4.17% and 4.20±2.04%, respectively, but these did not differ statistically (P=0.12). CONCLUSIONS We successfully quantified the volume change in intracranial aneurysms and intracranial normal arteries in human subjects. The data may indicate that cardiac cycle-related volume changes do not differ between unruptured aneurysms and normal intracranial arteries, suggesting that the global integrity of an unruptured aneurysmal wall is not different from that of normal intracranial arteries.","Kuroda, Junko; Kinoshita, Manabu; Tanaka, Hisashi; Nishida, Takeo; Nakamura, Hajime; Watanabe, Yoshiyuki; Tomiyama, Noriyuki; Fujinaka, Toshiyuki; Yoshimine, Toshiki",Stroke,216,12

Several sigma-1 receptor (Sig1R) ligands have been demonstrated to regulate the seizure threshold in acute and chronic seizure models. However, the mechanism by which Sig1R modulates the excitatory and inhibitory pathways in the brain has not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to compare the susceptibility to seizures of wild type (WT) and Sig1R knockout (Sig1R-/-) mice in intravenous pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and (+)-bicuculline (BIC) infusion-induced acute seizure and Sig1R antagonist NE-100-induced seizure models. To determine possible molecular mechanisms, we used quantitative PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry to assess the possible involvement of several seizure-related genes and proteins. Peripheral tissue contractile response of WT and Sig1R-/- mice was studied in an isolated vasa deferentia model. The most important finding was the significantly decreased expression of the R2 subunit of the GABA-B receptor in the hippocampus and habenula of Sig1R-/- mice. Our results demonstrated that Sig1R-/- mice have decreased thresholds for PTZ- and BIC-induced tonic seizures. In the NE-100-induced seizure model, Sig1R-/- animals demonstrated lower seizure scores, shorter durations and increased latency times of seizures compared to WT mice. Sig1R-independent activities of NE-100 included downregulation of the gene expression of iNOS and GABA-A γ2 and inhibition of KCl-induced depolarization in both WT and Sig1R-/- animals. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the lack of Sig1R resulted in decreased expression of the R2 subunit of the GABA-B receptor and increased susceptibility to seizures. Our results confirm that Sig1R is a significant molecular target for seizure modulation and warrants further investigation for the development of novel anti-seizure drugs.","Vavers, Edijs; Zvejniece, Baiba; Stelfa, Gundega; Svalbe, Baiba; Vilks, Karlis; Kupats, Einars; Mezapuke, Rudolfs; Lauberte, Lasma; Dambrova, Maija; Zvejniece, Liga",Neurobiology of disease,216,16

In this work, we study the versatility of the thiol-alkyne addition reaction in more depth. Contrary to previous findings with UCHL3, we now show that covalent adduct formation can progress with substituents on the terminal or internal alkyne position. Strikingly, acceptance of alkyne substituents is strictly DUB-specific as this is not conserved among members of the same subfamily. Covalent adduct formation with the catalytic cysteine residue was validated by gel analysis and mass spectrometry of intact ABP-treated USP16CDWT and catalytically inactive mutant USP16CDC205A. Bottom-up mass spectrometric analysis of the covalent adduct with a deuterated propargyl ABP provides mechanistic understanding of the in situ thiol-alkyne reaction, identifying the alkyne rather than an allenic intermediate as the reactive species. Furthermore, kinetic analysis revealed that introduction of (bulky/electron-donating) methyl substituents on the propargyl moiety decreases the rate of covalent adduct formation, thus providing a rational explanation for the commonly lower level of observed covalent adduct compared to unmodified alkynes. Altogether, our work extends the scope of possible propargyl derivatives in cysteine targeting ABPs from unmodified terminal alkynes to internal and substituted alkynes, which we anticipate will have great value in the development of ABPs with improved selectivity profiles.","Mons, Elma; Kim, Robbert Q; van Doodewaerd, Bjorn R; van Veelen, Peter A; Mulder, Monique P C; Ovaa, Huib",Journal of the American Chemical Society,216,29

METHODS Information on 1369 paediatric cases with COVID-19 from 8 December 2019 to 7 March 2020 in Hubei province was extracted from the National Infectious Disease Surveillance System. The analysis included epidemic curves, temporal-spatial distribution, clinical classification and interval times between onset and diagnosis. RESULTS Among 1369 paediatric cases, the median age was 9 years and 58.2% of them were males. The proportion of severe and critical cases in children was lower than that in adults and the proportion of asymptomatic cases in children was five times greater than for adult cases. The first paediatric case was reported on 2 January 2020, and the daily number of new paediatric cases remained high from 1 February through to 22 February. The epidemiological curve of paediatric cases lagged behind that of adults by 19 days, and the first spike of the epidemic curve in senior high school students occurred 1 week earlier than in other paediatric groups. The proportion of clustered cases among children was about twice that for adults. The median of the interval in paediatric cases between onset and diagnosis, isolation and notification were 3, 0 and 3 days, respectively, and all of those were significantly shorter than in adults. CONCLUSIONS The epidemic curve of child cases lagged behind that of adult cases by 19 days, and the major form of transmission observed was in clusters.","Wang, Mengyi; Nie, XiuQuan; Huang, Shuqiong; Pi, Wei; Wang, Dongming; Zhou, Min; Ma, Jixuan; Li, Mingyan; Chen, Weihong",Journal of paediatrics and child health,216,25

This study aimed to evaluate the pandemic's impact on psoriasis patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS The multicenter study was conducted in 14 tertiary dermatology centers. Demographic data, treatment status, disease course, and cases of COVID-19 were evaluated in patients with psoriasis using the immunosuppressive treatment. RESULTS Of 1827 patients included, the drug adherence rate was 68.2%. Those receiving anti-interleukin (anti-IL) drugs were more likely to continue treatment than patients receiving conventional drugs (OR = 1.50, 95% CI, 1.181-1.895, p = .001). Disease worsening rate was 24.2% and drug dose reduction increased this rate 3.26 and drug withdrawal 8.71 times. Receiving anti-TNF or anti-IL drugs was associated with less disease worsening compared to conventional drugs (p = .038, p = .032; respectively). Drug withdrawal causes were 'unable to come' (39.6%), 'COVID concern' (25.3%), and 'physician's and patient's co-decision' (17.4%). Four patients had COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms. The incidence was 0.0022% while it was 0.0025% in the general population. CONCLUSION Our study shows that psoriasis patients using systemic immunosuppressive do not have a higher, but even lower COVID-19 risk than the general population, and treatment compliance with biological drugs is higher.","Kartal, Selda Pelin; Çelik, Gökçen; Yılmaz, Oğuz; Öksüm Solak, Eda; Demirbağ Gül, Büşra; Üstünbaş, Tuba Kevser; Gönülal, Melis; Baysak, Sevim; Yüksel, Esma İnan; Ünlü, Begüm; Güven, Münevver; Bozdağ, Ali; Çınar, Gökhan; Kartal, Selim; Borlu, Murat; Özden, Müge Güler; Engin, Burhan; Serdaroğlu, Server; Balcı, Didem Didar; Doğan, Bilal; Çiçek, Demet; Yazıcı, Ayça Cordan; Aytekin, Sema; Şendur, Neslihan; Sarıcaoglu, Hayriye; Kaçar, Nida Gelincik; Doğramacı, Asena Cigdem; Dönmez, Levent; Alpsoy, Erkan",The Journal of dermatological treatment,216,31

BACKGROUND In response to the public health measures in Hawaii to curtail the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, Hawaii Pacific Neuroscience (HPN) adapted their patient care to ensure continuity of neurological treatment. METHODS The telephone survey was conducted on patients seen at HPN during the period of April 22, 2020-May 18, 2020 to address four areas related to patients' outpatient experience: delivery of care, general well-being, experience with telemedicine, and disease-specific questions. RESULTS A total of 928 patients were contacted of which 429 (46.2%) patients responded and 367 (85.5%) agreed to participate. A total of 133 patients with migraine and 234 patients with other neurological conditions provided responses. Our migraine patients' survey responses suggest that their well-being was disproportionately negatively affected by the pandemic. Survey respondents with migraine were significantly more likely than their non-migraine peers to report worsening anxiety and sleep problems [62/132 (47.0%) vs. 78/234 (33.3%), χ2 = 6.64, p = 0.010, and 64/132 (48.5%) vs. 73/234 (31.2%), χ2 = 10.77, p = 0.001]; migraine patients also reported worsening of depression as a result of the pandemic more than patients with other diagnoses, though this was not statistically significant [44/132 (33.3%) vs. 57/234 (24.4%), χ2 = 3.40, p = 0.065]. In regard to access to healthcare, significantly more migraine patients reported running out of medications than those with other diagnoses [20/133 (15.0%) vs. 18/234 (7.7%), χ2 = 4.93, p = 0.026]. More avoided seeking medical help for new health problems because of the pandemic [30/133 (22.6%) vs. 30/234 (12.8%), χ2 = 5.88, p = 0.015]. Migraine patients were also significantly impacted economically by the pandemic; 43/132 (32.4%) of migraine patients reported losing their jobs as the result of the pandemic versus 34/234 (14.5%) of their peers (χ2 = 11.20, p < 0.001). An increase in headache severity or frequency was reported in 39/118 (33.1%) of respondents and 19/118 (16.1%) reported to using more abortive therapy than usual. Telemedicine was well received by almost all patients who took advantage of the option. Most of those patients found telemedicine to be easy to use and as valuable as an in-person visit. Migraine patients indicated with more frequency that without the telemedicine option, they would have missed their medical appointments [37/68 (54.4%) vs. 56/144 (38.6%), χ2 = 4.31, p = 0.038]; a majority would prefer or consider telemedicine for future appointments over in-person visits. CONCLUSIONS Insights gained from this QI survey to the practice's new pandemic-related processes include stressing lifestyle modification, optimizing treatment plans, and continuing the option of telemedicine.","Smith, Maiya; Nakamoto, Max; Crocker, Julie; Tiffany Morden, Frances; Liu, Keke; Ma, Enze; Chong, Ariel; Van, Nicholas; Vajjala, Vimala; Carrazana, Enrique; Viereck, Jason; Liow, Kore",Headache,216,5

Multistage random sampling procedure was adopted for the primary survey and data was collected through face-to-face personal interview from 18,609 cattle and buffalo rearing farm households from 123 districts across twelve states and one Union Territory. Besides epidemiological parameters, different farm-level direct and indirect loss associated with FMD was assessed at disaggregated level (states) by employing deterministic mathematical models. Highest number of affected villages and disease incidence was observed in non- FMD control programme (FMD-CP) implemented Madhya Pradesh and Assam states, respectively whereas negligible incidence was in FMD-CP implemented Punjab state. The disease incidence was high during 2013-14 and declined during 2014-15 and 2015-16, respectively implied severe incidence scenario (2013-14) succeeded by moderate (2014-15) and mild (2015-16) scenarios. The crossbred and high productive animals were severely affected than local breeds whereas on sexwise and agewise comparison revealed higher incidence in females and adult animals. During severe incidence scenario, milk loss/animal ranged from USD 6.87-47.44, 18.42-125.88, 16.33-91.43, and 27.17-123.62; mortality loss/animal ranged from USD 32.61-804.27, 30.76-577.7, 65.36-502.2, and 188.04-413.7; distress sale loss/animal ranged from USD 3.22-188.63, 64.34-519.3, 214.47-341.8, and 209.11-450.3; and opportunity cost of labour/animal from USD 5.49-54.29, 5.49-67.78; 7.95-31.37 and 9.83-72.38 in indigenous cattle, crossbred cattle, local and improved buffalo, respectively. The estimated draught power loss/animal varied from USD 39.46-142.94 with least being in Madhya Pradesh and highest in Assam states whereas the median treatment cost/animal was USD 9.18 and USD 27.07 in indigenous cattle and upgraded buffaloes, respectively. The total farm-level economic loss projected due to FMD in cattle and buffaloes in India was USD 3159 million (INR 221,110 million), USD 270 million (INR 18,910 million) and USD 152 million (INR 10,610 million), respectively during the severe, moderate and mild incidence scenarios at 2015-16 constant prices. The loss varied across the states, and in severe incidence scenario, the country might lose USD 3.2 billion/year and hence, the bi-annual vaccination schedule need to be strictly implemented in all the states. Besides timely vaccination coverage, managing unabated animal movement, educating and motivating the farmers to vaccinate their animals might reduce the incidence and consequential losses to various stakeholders in endemic states like India.","G, Govindaraj; B, Ganesh Kumar; A, Krishnamohan; Hegde, Raveendra; Kumar, Nanda; Prabhakaran, Kokila; Wadhwan, Vinay Mohan; Kakker, Naresh; Lokhande, T; Sharma, Krishna; Kanani, Amit; Limaye,; K, Natchimuthu; Pn, Ananth; De, Arup Kumar; Khan, Tanveer Ahmed; Misri, Jyoti; Dash, B B; Pattnaik, Bramhadev; Habibur, Rahman",Preventive veterinary medicine,216,1

In previous studies, autologous gene therapy with γ-retroviral vectors failed to reconstitute B-cell and NK-cell immunity and was complicated by vector-related leukemia. METHODS We performed a dual-center, phase 1-2 safety and efficacy study of a lentiviral vector to transfer IL2RG complementary DNA to bone marrow stem cells after low-exposure, targeted busulfan conditioning in eight infants with newly diagnosed SCID-X1. RESULTS Eight infants with SCID-X1 were followed for a median of 16.4 months. Bone marrow harvest, busulfan conditioning, and cell infusion had no unexpected side effects. In seven infants, the numbers of CD3+, CD4+, and naive CD4+ T cells and NK cells normalized by 3 to 4 months after infusion and were accompanied by vector marking in T cells, B cells, NK cells, myeloid cells, and bone marrow progenitors. The eighth infant had an insufficient T-cell count initially, but T cells developed in this infant after a boost of gene-corrected cells without busulfan conditioning. Previous infections cleared in all infants, and all continued to grow normally. IgM levels normalized in seven of the eight infants, of whom four discontinued intravenous immune globulin supplementation; three of these four infants had a response to vaccines. Vector insertion-site analysis was performed in seven infants and showed polyclonal patterns without clonal dominance in all seven. CONCLUSIONS Lentiviral vector gene therapy combined with low-exposure, targeted busulfan conditioning in infants with newly diagnosed SCID-X1 had low-grade acute toxic effects and resulted in multilineage engraftment of transduced cells, reconstitution of functional T cells and B cells, and normalization of NK-cell counts during a median follow-up of 16 months.

Both can induce durable responses; however, cross-trial comparisons are difficult due to differences in study design. In this study, the registration trials of axi-cel and tisa-cel were compared using a matching adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). METHODS A MAIC was performed to adjust for differences in patient characteristics between trials. The estimates for the ZUMA-1 (axi-cel) trial were adjusted using patient-level data to match the study population in JULIET (tisa-cel) for key variables: IPI, ECOG, stage, refractoriness or relapsed disease, double/triple hit status, cell-of-origin, and number of prior lines of therapy. The endpoints analysed were response, overall survival (OS), and adverse events. RESULTS After adjusting for differences in patient characteristics between trials, axi-cel was associated with a greater objective response rate (relative risk [RR] =1.61 [95% CI 1.29-2.01]) and complete response (RR = 1.62 [1.16-2.27]) than tisa-cel among patients who underwent infusion. The OS from infusion onward comparing axi-cel to tisa-cel had a hazard ratio of 0.51 (0.31-0.83). The indirect comparison showed a higher rate of Grade 1-2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in ZUMA-1 compared with JULIET; (RR =2.03 [1.55-2.65]) and similar rates of Grade ≥3 CRS and neurologic events (NE). CONCLUSIONS In the absence of a direct head-to-head study, the MAIC statistical technique suggests axi-cel may have superior efficacy but a greater risk of Grade 1-2 CRS. Future real world studies can further inform the relative efficacy and safety of CAR T therapies in RR-LBCL.","Oluwole, Olalekan O; Jansen, Jeroen P; Lin, Vincent W; Chan, Keith; Keeping, Sam; Navale, Lynn; Locke, Frederick L",Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,216,16

However, the concept has not been adopted strongly in healthcare training, continuing professional development, or daily practice. A systematic review with a narrative synthesis was undertaken to map the evidence for flow in healthcare. METHODS A search was conducted in MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and EMBASE in July 2019 and updated in October 2020 for manuscripts discussing flow in all healthcare disciplines. Articles published between 1806 to October 13 2020 were included. Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts (and subsequently full-texts where necessary) for inclusion. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Data were extracted on location, manuscript type, population and context, measures, and key findings. RESULTS 4923 unique abstracts were initially retrieved and 15 articles were included in the final review. We report on the experience, benefits, and strategies to support flow in healthcare. Flow may benefit providers by enhancing career enjoyment, wellness and performance, while mitigating exhaustion, burnout, and stress. While research from other domains has focused on supporting flow through individualized training, our results highlight the importance of system and environmental factors. CONCLUSIONS Supporting professional and trainee flow in healthcare requires a holistic approach, including individual training and system-level interventions.","McQueen, Sydney; Jiang, Stephanie; McParland, Aidan; Hammond Mobilio, Melanie; Moulton, Carol-Anne",Medical education,216,1

OBJECTIVE To report the outcomes of WUS patients with large vessel occlusions, selected for intervention based on Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) and treated with stent retrievers or primary aspiration thrombectomy. METHODS Data were collected retrospectively for each consecutive WUS patient undergoing mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever or primary aspiration catheter between February 2015 and September 2016. ASPECTS ≥ 6 was used as the primary imaging criterion for offering thrombectomy in these WUS patients. Main outcomes were the in-hospital improvement in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the occurrence of symptomatic hemorrhage. RESULTS Twelve patients were included in this study; 11 were treated with stent retrievers and 1 was treated with primary aspiration thrombectomy alone. Successful recanalization was achieved in 100% of the patients (33% thrombolysis in cerebral infarction [TICI] 2B and 67% TICI 3). Every patient experienced a reduction in the NIHSS during hospitalization, with a mean NIHSS decrease of 11.1 ± 5.1 points. There was a trend for a larger reduction in the NIHSS in patients with TICI 3 compared to TICI 2B recanalization. There was no symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in our cohort. CONCLUSIONS For patients with WUS, careful selection of patients using ASPECTS may allow for safe interventions, with low risk of clinical deterioration, and no-periprocedural mortality. All our patients demonstrated a reduction in their NIHSS after the thrombectomy and clinical improvement.","Konstas, Angelos Aristeidis; Minaeian, Artin; Ross, Ian B",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,216,1
65998,65998,65998,Acute endovascular recanalization: lessons from randomized controlled trials.,15.409851,8.832543,2016,"BACKGROUND Endotracheal intubation (ETI) can be challenging, especially in life-threatening situations such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Videolaryngoscopes aim to ease ETI, but effort is still widely discussed. This study intended to investigate 2 different airway devices regarding the success rate of ETI during ongoing chest compressions. METHODS This randomized, cross-over, multi-center manikin trial included 85 experienced paramedics actively working in the emergency medicine service. After a standardized training session, all paramedics underwent 3 airway scenarios using both, direct laryngoscopy using a Macintosh blade and videolaryngoscope (the UEScope): normal airway without chest compressions, normal airway with uninterrupted chest compressions, and difficult airway with uninterrupted chest compressions. The primary outcome was successful ETI, defined as successful placement of the endotracheal tube within the manikin's trachea. Secondary outcomes were number of intubation attempts, time to successful ETI, time to best glottis view, best percent of glottic opening, best glottic view score (Cormack and Lehane), occurrence of dental trauma, ease of use, and willing to reuse in real-life situations. RESULTS The UEScope provided a better glottis visualization, and higher first pass intubation success rate compared to direct laryngoscopy in all 3 scenarios. The overall intubation success was higher, and the intubation time was shorter with the UEScope in scenario B and scenario C, but was comparable in scenario A. Dental compression occurred less often using the UEScope and paramedics rated intubation using the UEScope easier compared to direct laryngoscopy in all 3 airway scenarios. CONCLUSION In simulated CPR scenarios, intubation with the UEScope resulted in a better glottis visualization, a higher intubation success, and a shorter intubation time compared to Macintosh laryngoscope (MAC). Moreover, in situations where the airway is difficult for ETI especially by the paramedic, the UEScope would be a better choice than the MAC. Further studies are needed to confirm these results in real-life patients.","Szarpak, Lukasz; Madziala, Agnieszka; Czekajlo, Michael; Smereka, Jacek; Kaserer, Alexander; Dabrowski, Marek; Madziala, Marcin; Yakubtsevich, Ruslan; Ladny, Jerzy Robert; Ruetzler, Kurt",Medicine,216,1

As adult patients have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, pediatric practitioners world-wide have stepped forward to support their adult colleagues. In general, standalone pediatric hospitals expanded their capacity to centralize pediatric critical care, decanting patients from other institutions. There are few units that ran a hybrid model, managing both adult and pediatric patients with the same PICU staff. In this report, we describe the hybrid model implemented at our respective institutions with shared experiences, pitfalls, challenges, and adjustments required in caring for both young and older patients. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Two PICUs in urban tertiary hospitals in London and New York. PATIENTS Adult and pediatric patients admitted to the PICU in roughly a 6-week period during the coronavirus disease 2019 surge. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The PICU at King's College Hospital admitted 23 non-coronavirus disease adult patients, while whereas the PICU at Morgan Stanley's Children Hospital in New York admitted 46 adults, 30 of whom were coronavirus disease positive. The median age of adult patients at King's College Hospital was higher than those admitted in New York, 53 years (19-77 yr) and 24.4 years (18-52 yr), respectively. Catering to the different physical, emotional, and social needs of both children and adults by the same PICU team was challenging. One important consideration in both locations was the continued care of patients with severe non-coronavirus disease-related illnesses such as neurosurgical emergencies, trauma, and septic shock. Furthermore, retention of critical specialists such as transplant services allowed for nine and four solid organ transplants to occur in London and New York, respectively. CONCLUSIONS This hybrid model successfully allowed for the expansion into adult critical care while maintaining essential services for critically ill children. Simultaneous care of adults and children in the ICU can be sustained if healthcare professionals work collaboratively, show proactive insight into anticipated issues, and exhibit clear leadership.","Deep, Akash; Knight, Philip; Kernie, Steven G; D'Silva, Pam; Sobin, Brittany; Best, Thomas; Zorrilla, Maria; Carson, Lydia; Zoica, Bogdana; Ahn, Danielle",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,216,1

We aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on First Nations people health assessments using an interrupted time series model utilizing data extracted from the Australian Medicare Benefits Schedule database. Additive triple exponential smoothing was used to model health assessments undertaken between January 2017 and December 2019. The model was used to predict health assessments between January 2020 and June 2020 with 95% confidence (P < .05). There was no significant difference between observed and predicted First Nations people health assessments in January, February, and June 2020. However, we found a statistically significant decrease in health assessments in March (16.5%), April (23.1%), and May (17.2%) 2020. The proportion of total health assessments delivered via telehealth was 0.5%, 23.6%, 17.6%, and 10.0% for March, April, May, and June 2020, respectively. The decrease in total First Nations people health assessments compounds the risk of poorer health outcomes in this population already vulnerable due to a high burden of chronic disease and considerable social, economic, and health inequalities.

Moreover, conscientious employees tend to be more satisfied and less stressed from their work. One consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, is that many workers have transitioned to working remotely, often under conditions of less direct supervision and less clarity about expected work activities and outcomes. We proposed that this significant change in work context constitutes a weakening of situational strength that can change the relationship of conscientiousness with job strain, job satisfaction, and job performance. Using Meyer et al.'s (2010) conceptualization of situational strength, we tested the moderating effect of situational strength by surveying 474 white-collar employees in a Fortune-1000 firm in 2019 and again in 2020 after they had all transitioned to working remotely. We found that the changes in work context due to COVID-19 significantly lowered scores on situational strength and this was accompanied by a stronger positive effect of conscientiousness on performance. Importantly, during COVID-19, the relationships of conscientiousness with strain and satisfaction showed a reversal of sign, with more conscientious workers reporting higher strain and lower satisfaction. These effects were partially mediated by job demands and were replicated with work hours. The results provide a test of situational strength theory and suggest that changes in situational strength due to COVID-19 may cause an organization's most conscientious employees to be at elevated risk for burnout and dissatisfaction, and consequently, turnover, if not managed appropriately.

67824,67824,67824,Human Aortic Valve Interstitial Cells Display Proangiogenic Properties During Calcific Aortic Valve Disease.,15.573247,9.11625,2020-11-05,"UNLABELLED The unfolded-protein response (UPR) is a signal transduction cascade triggered by perturbation of the homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). UPR resolves ER stress by activating a cascade of cellular responses, including the induction of molecular chaperones, translational attenuation, ER-associated degradation, and other mechanisms. Under prolonged and irremediable ER stress, however, the UPR can also trigger apoptosis. Here, we report that in cells infected with the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), ER stress was induced and the IRE1α-XBP1 pathway of UPR was activated. Knockdown and overexpression experiments demonstrated that IRE1α protects infected cells from IBV-induced apoptosis, which required both its kinase and RNase activities. Our data also suggest that splicing of XBP1 mRNA by IRE1α appears to convert XBP1 from a proapoptotic XBP1u protein to a prosurvival XBP1s protein. Moreover, IRE1α antagonized IBV-induced apoptosis by modulating the phosphorylation status of the proapoptotic c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the prosurvival RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt). Taken together, the data indicate that the ER stress sensor IRE1α is activated in IBV-infected cells and serves as a survival factor during coronavirus infection. IMPORTANCE Animal coronaviruses are important veterinary viruses, which could cross the species barrier, becoming severe human pathogens. Molecular characterization of the interactions between coronaviruses and host cells is pivotal to understanding the pathogenicity and species specificity of coronavirus infection. It has been well established that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is closely associated with coronavirus replication. Here, we report that inositol-requiring protein 1 alpha (IRE1α), a key sensor of ER stress, is activated in cells infected with the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Moreover, IRE1α is shown to protect the infected cells from apoptosis by modulating the unfolded-protein response (UPR) and two kinases related to cell survival. This study demonstrates that UPR activation constitutes a major aspect of coronavirus-host interactions. Manipulations of the coronavirus-induced UPR may provide novel therapeutic targets for the control of coronavirus infection and pathogenesis.","Fung, To Sing; Liao, Ying; Liu, Ding Xiang",Journal of virology,216,1

Here, we performed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of ~116,000 nuclei of lungs from 19 COVID-19 decedents who underwent rapid autopsy and 7 control lungs. Integrated analyses revealed significant alterations in cellular composition, transcriptional cell states, and cell-to-cell interactions, providing insights into the biology of lethal COVID-19. COVID-19 lungs were highly inflamed with dense infiltration of aberrantly activated monocyte-derived macrophages and alveolar macrophages, but demonstrated impaired T cell responses. Monocyte/macrophage-derived IL-1β and epithelial cell-derived IL-6 were unique features of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to other viral and bacterial causes of pneumonia. Alveolar type 2 cells adopted an inflammation-associated transient progenitor cell state and failed to undergo full transition into alveolar type 1 cells resulting in impaired lung regeneration. Furthermore, we identified expansion of recently described CTHRC1+ pathological fibroblasts3 contributing to rapidly ensuing pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19. Inference of protein activity and ligand-receptor interactions identified putative drug targets to disrupt deleterious circuits. This atlas enables dissection of lethal COVID-19, may inform our understanding of long-term complications of COVID-19 survivors, and provides an important resource for therapeutic development.","Melms, Johannes C; Biermann, Jana; Huang, Huachao; Wang, Yiping; Nair, Ajay; Tagore, Somnath; Katsyv, Igor; Rendeiro, André F; Amin, Amit Dipak; Schapiro, Denis; Frangieh, Chris J; Luoma, Adrienne M; Filliol, Aveline; Fang, Yinshan; Ravichandran, Hiranmayi; Clausi, Mariano G; Alba, George A; Rogava, Meri; Chen, Sean W; Ho, Patricia; Montoro, Daniel T; Kornberg, Adam E; Han, Arnold S; Bakhoum, Mathieu F; Anandasabapathy, Niroshana; Suárez-Fariñas, Mayte; Bakhoum, Samuel F; Bram, Yaron; Borczuk, Alain; Guo, Xinzheng V; Lefkowitch, Jay H; Marboe, Charles; Lagana, Stephen M; Del Portillo, Armando; Zorn, Emmanuel; Markowitz, Glen S; Schwabe, Robert F; Schwartz, Robert E; Elemento, Olivier; Saqi, Anjali; Hibshoosh, Hanina; Que, Jianwen; Izar, Benjamin",Nature,216,1

Current therapy for pressure ulcers consists of conservative medical management for shallow lesions and aggressive debridement and surgery for deeper lesions. The current study uses a murine model to address the hypothesis that adipose-derived stromal/stem cell (ASC) treatment would accelerate and enhance pressure ulcer repair. The dorsal skin of both young (2 months old [mo]) and old (20 mo) C57BL/6J female mice was sandwiched between external magnets for 12 hours over 2 consecutive days to initiate a pressure ulcer. One day following the induction, mice were injected with ASCs isolated from congenic mice transgenic for the green fluorescent protein under a ubiquitous promoter. Relative to phosphate-buffered saline-treated controls, ASC-treated mice displayed a cell concentration-dependent acceleration of wound closure, improved epidermal/dermal architecture, increased adipogenesis, and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration. The ASC-induced improvements occurred in both young and elderly recipients, although the expression profile of angiogenic, immunomodulatory, and reparative mRNAs differed as a function of age. The results are consistent with clinical reports that fat grafting improved skin architecture in thermal injuries; the authors of this published study have invoked ASC-based mechanisms to account for their clinical outcomes. Thus, the current proof-of-principle study sets the stage for clinical translation of autologous and/or allogeneic ASC treatment of pressure ulcers. SIGNIFICANCE Adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) promote the healing of pressure ulcer wounds in both young and old mice. ASCs enhance wound healing rates through adipogenic differentiation and regeneration of the underlying architecture of the skin.","Strong, Amy L; Bowles, Annie C; MacCrimmon, Connor P; Frazier, Trivia P; Lee, Stephen J; Wu, Xiying; Katz, Adam J; Gawronska-Kozak, Barbara; Bunnell, Bruce A; Gimble, Jeffrey M",Stem cells translational medicine,216,16

How to improve production performance under limited labor resources is an urgent problem for global manufacturing factories. This work studies an energy-efficient job-shop scheduling problem with limited workers. Those workers can have multiskills. A many-objective model with five objectives, that is: 1) makespan; 2) total tardiness; 3) total idle time; 4) total worker cost; and 5) total energy, is built. To solve this many-objective optimization problem (MaOP), a novel fitness evaluation mechanism (FEM) based on fuzzy correlation entropy (FCE) is adopted. Two construction methods for reference points are proposed to build the bridge between MaOP and a fuzzy set. Based on FCE and cluster methods, an environmental selection mechanism (ESM) is proposed to achieve a balance between solution convergence and diversity. With the proposed FEM and ESM, two many-objective evolutionary algorithms are proposed to solve MaOP. The effect of FCE-based FEM and ESM on the performance of algorithms is verified via experiments. The proposed algorithms are compared with four well-known peers to test their performance. The extensive experimental results show that they are very competitive for the considered many-objective scheduling problem.","Li, Wenfeng; He, Lijun; Cao, Yulian",IEEE transactions on cybernetics,216,11

METHODS Single-centre, single-surgeon retrospective chart review of consecutive patients with high myopic FTMH who underwent surgery with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. Patients were divided in group 1 (naïve) and group 2 (persistent). Quantitative and qualitative variables were analysed, compared among groups and correlated with best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). RESULTS Postoperatively, FTMH resolved in 28/31 eyes in group 1 (90%) and in 10/11 eyes in group 2 (91%), without significant differences (p = 0.954). None of the preoperative anatomical variables analysed showed significant association with preoperative BCVA. Intraoperatively, no significant complications were registered. Postoperatively, BCVA improved significantly in the studied population (p < 0.001). Preoperative factors associated with better postoperative BCVA were the presence of intraretinal cystoid spaces (p = 0.028) and elevated FTMH borders (p = 0.005).

At the same time, cells are spatially heterogeneous systems in which subcellular compartmentalization of different functions is ubiquitous and requires efficient cross-compartmental communication. Dynamic redistribution of multitudinous proteins to different subcellular locations in response to cellular functional state is increasingly recognized as a crucial characteristic of cellular function that seems to be at least as important as overall changes in protein abundance. Characterization of the subcellular spatial dynamics of protein distribution is a major challenge for proteomics and recent results with MCF7 breast cancer cells suggest that this may be of particular importance for cancer cells.","Pinto, Gabriella; Alhaiek, Abdulrab Ahmed M; Godovac-Zimmermann, Jasminka",Expert review of proteomics,216,16

AIM To give insight into aspects of end-of-life care practices that might have jeopardised or supported the dignity of the patients and their family members during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. METHODOLOGY A qualitative study involving 25 in-depth interviews with purposively sampled bereaved relatives of patients who died during the COVID-19 pandemic between March and July 2020 in the Netherlands. We created a dignity-inspired framework for analysis, and used the models of Chochinov et al. and Van Gennip et al. as sensitising concepts. These focus on illness-related aspects and the individual, relational and societal/organisational level of dignity. RESULTS Four themes concerning aspects of end-of-life care practices were identified as possibly jeopardising the dignity of patients or relatives: 'Dealing with an unknown illness', 'Being isolated', 'Restricted farewells' and 'Lack of attentiveness and communication'. The analysis showed that 'Meaningful end-of-life moments' and 'Compassionate professional support' contributed to the dignity of patients and their relatives. CONCLUSION This study illuminates possible aspects of end-of-life care practices that jeopardised or supported dignity. Experienced dignity of bereaved relatives was associated with the unfamiliarity of the virus and issues associated with preventive measures. However, most aspects that had an impact on the dignity experiences of relatives were based in human action and relationships. Relatives experienced that preventive measures could be mitigated by health care professionals to make them less devastating.","Becqué, Yvonne N; van der Geugten, Wendy; van der Heide, Agnes; Korfage, Ida J; Pasman, H Roeline W; Onwuteaka-Philipsen, Bregje D; Zee, Masha; Witkamp, Erica; Goossensen, Anne",Scandinavian journal of caring sciences,216,16

Most patients with CSPN have significant pain. Many medications have been tried for pain reduction in CSPN, including antiepileptics, antidepressants, and sodium channel blockers. There are no comparative studies that identify the most effective medication for pain reduction in CSPN. Objective To determine which medication (pregabalin, duloxetine, nortriptyline, or mexiletine) is most effective for reducing neuropathic pain and best tolerated in patients with CSPN. Design, Setting, and Participants From December 1, 2014, through October 20, 2017, a bayesian adaptive, open-label randomized clinical comparative effectiveness study of pain in 402 participants with CSPN was conducted at 40 neurology care clinics. The trial included response adaptive randomization. Participants were patients with CSPN who were 30 years or older, with a pain score of 4 or greater on a numerical rating scale (range, 0-10, with higher scores indicating a higher level of pain). Participant allocation to 1 of 4 drug groups used the utility function and treatment's sample size for response adaptation randomization. At each interim analysis, a decision was made to continue enrolling (up to 400 participants) or stop the whole trial for success (80% power). Patient engagement was maintained throughout the trial, which helped guide the study and identify ways to communicate and disseminate information. Analysis was performed from December 11, 2015, to January 19, 2018. Interventions Participants were randomized to receive nortriptyline (n = 134), duloxetine (n = 126), pregabalin (n = 73), or mexiletine (n = 69). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was a utility function that was a composite of the efficacy (participant reported pain reduction of ≥50% from baseline to week 12) and quit (participants who discontinued medication) rates. Results Among the 402 participants (213 men [53.0%]; mean [SD] age, 60.1 [13.4] years; 343 White [85.3%]), the utility function of nortriptyline was 0.81 (95% bayesian credible interval [CrI], 0.69-0.93; 34 of 134 [25.4%] efficacious; and 51 of 134 [38.1%] quit), of duloxetine was 0.80 (95% CrI, 0.68-0.92; 29 of 126 [23.0%] efficacious; and 47 of 126 [37.3%] quit), pregabalin was 0.69 (95% CrI, 0.55-0.84; 11 of 73 [15.1%] efficacious; and 31 of 73 [42.5%] quit), and mexiletine was 0.58 (95% CrI, 0.42-0.75; 14 of 69 [20.3%] efficacious; and 40 of 69 [58.0%] quit). The probability each medication yielded the highest utility was 0.52 for nortriptyline, 0.43 for duloxetine, 0.05 for pregabalin, and 0.00 for mexiletine. Conclusions and Relevance This study found that, although there was no clearly superior medication, nortriptyline and duloxetine outperformed pregabalin and mexiletine when pain reduction and undesirable adverse effects are combined to a single end point.

Nevertheless, physicians may choose to transfuse older adults more liberally than younger adults. It is unclear whether older patients have higher odds than younger patients of being transfused in the perioperative period. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the odds of transfusion are higher in older patients than in younger patients in the perioperative period. METHODS We conducted this retrospective observational cohort study at a tertiary care academic medical center. We included adults who had undergone a surgical procedure as an inpatient at our institution from January 2010 to February 2012. The primary analysis compared the odds of transfusion for patients >65 years old with the odds of transfusion in younger patients based on multilevel multivariable logistic regression analyses including adjustment for comorbidities, surgical service, lowest in-hospital hemoglobin value, gender, and estimated surgical blood loss and accounted for clustering by the surgeon and procedure. RESULTS We included 20,930 patients in this analysis. In multilevel models adjusted for comorbidities, surgical service, estimated surgical blood loss, and lowest in-hospital hemoglobin value, with surgeon and procedure as random effects, patients > 65 years old had 62% greater odds (odds ratio, 1.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.40-1.88; P < 0.0001) of being transfused than did younger patients. When patients were stratified by lowest in-hospital hemoglobin (7.00-7.99, 8.00-8.99, 9.00-9.99, and ≥10.00 g/dL), the odds of transfusion generally increased with each additional decade of age in every stratum, except for that containing patients in whom the lowest in-hospital hemoglobin did not decrease below 10 g/dL. When the odds of transfusion were compared between younger and older patients, significant differences were observed among surgical services (P = 0.02) but not among anesthesia specialty divisions (P = 0.9). CONCLUSIONS Older adults have greater odds of receiving red blood cell transfusion in the perioperative period than do younger patients, despite the lack of evidence supporting higher hemoglobin triggers in elderly patients. Further research is needed to determine whether transfusion practice in the elderly is an opportunity for education to improve blood management.","Brown, Charles H; Savage, William J; Masear, Courtney G; Walston, Jeremy D; Tian, Jing; Colantuoni, Elizabeth; Hogue, Charles W; Frank, Steven M",Anesthesia and analgesia,216,1

We sought to validate the NICE screening pathway through a prospective regional programme across a 5.2 million population over a two-year period. METHODS AND RESULTS Pathology departments at 14 hospital trusts in the Yorkshire and Humber region of the UK were invited to refer material from patients with newly diagnosed CRC aged 50 years or over between 1st April 2017 and 31st March 2019 for LS screening. Testing consisted of immunohistochemistry for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 followed by BRAF mutation analysis +/- MLH1 promoter methylation testing in cases showing MLH1 loss. 3,141 individual specimens were submitted for testing from 12 departments consisting of 3,061 unique tumours and 2,791 prospectively acquired patients with CRC. Defective mismatch repair (dMMR) was observed in 15% of cases. In cases showing MLH1 loss, 76% contained a detectable BRAF mutation and of the remainder, 77% showed MLH1 promoter hypermethylation. Of the patients included in the final analysis, 81 (2.9%) had an indication for germline testing. CONCLUSION LS screening using the NICE diagnostics guidance pathway is deliverable at scale identifying significant numbers of patients with dMMR. This information is used to refer patients to regional clinical genetics services in addition to informing treatment pathways including the use of adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy.","West, Nicholas P; Gallop, Niall; Kaye, Danny; Glover, Amy; Young, Caroline; Hutchins, Gordon G A; Brockmoeller, Scarlet F; Westwood, Alice C; Rossington, Hannah; Quirke, Philip",Histopathology,216,4

In this review we discuss the drugs suggested as therapy for COVID-19 infection, with a focus on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The list of drugs used for COVID-19 treatment includes a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir, alpha-interferon, ribavirin, atazanavir, umifenovir, and tocilizumab. As their efficacy and safety are under investigation, none of the regulatory agencies approved them for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. Although chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine possess antiviral and immunomodulatory effects, in practice benefit of their use for COVID-19 treatment is controversial. Several studies investigating hydroxychloroquine were stopped and the French national medicines regulator suspended its use in clinical trials due to safety concerns. The results from the double-blind, randomized clinical trials, including large number of participants, will add better insight into the role of these two drugs as already available and affordable, antimalarial therapy. The ethical issue on emergency use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the settings of COVID-19 should be carefully managed, with adherence to the ""monitored emergency use of unregistered and experimental interventions"" (MEURI) framework or be ethically approved as a trial, as stated by the WHO. Potential shortage of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine on the market can be overbridged with regular prescriptions by medical doctors and national drug agency should ensure sufficient quantities of these drugs for standard indications.","Dragojevic Simic, Viktorija; Miljkovic, Milijana; Stamenkovic, Dusica; Vekic, Berislav; Ratkovic, Nenad; Simic, Radoje; Rancic, Nemanja",International journal of clinical practice,216,24

Important considerations in the diagnosis of treatment-resistant hypertension include the exclusion of pseudoresistance and the evaluation of potential secondary causes of hypertension and of concomitant conditions that maintain high blood pressure. The ability to diagnose true treatment-resistant hypertension is important for selection of patients who may be appropriately treated with an invasive therapy. Currently, there are three interventional approaches to treat resistant hypertension, namely: (1) reduction of the activity of the sympathetic nervous system by renal nerve ablation, (2) stimulation of baroreceptors and (3) creation of a peripheral arterial venous anastomosis. This review focuses on the rationale behind these invasive approaches and the clinical results.","Erne, Paul; Sudano, Isabella; Resink, Therese J; Lüscher, Thomas F",Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,216,1

Health outcomes vary widely among Latino subgroups and health disparities more adversely affect rural residents. The commonly used ""one-size-fits-all"" approach assumes that the U.S. Latino population is homogeneous. Sample Method Rural Latinos in four study states: Arizona (AZ), California (CA), Florida (FL) and Texas (TX) were the focus of this study. This research describes changes in the Latino population in rural counties of the U.S. in two dimensions: 1) change in population by number, and 2) change in population by country of origin using data from 2000-2017. Findings The following themes emerged: 1) the overall Latino population grew in each state; 2) rural Latino populations in each state also increased but at a higher rate; 3) there is a variety of diversity in the countries of origin of rural Latinos based in each state; and 4) a considerable proportion of Latinos living in rural areas are of unknown Latino origins. Conclusions As the largest racial or ethnic minority in rural populations and as the second largest group in the nation, Latino health has a significant influence on the U.S. healthcare system.

This study evaluated several mental health and well-being indicators in a large sample from the United Kingdom (UK) during the COVID-19 lockdown where the death rate is currently the highest in Europe. METHODS A cross-sectional online survey with a study sample that mirrors general population norms according to sex, age, education, and region was launched four weeks after lockdown measures were implemented in the UK. Measures included mental health-related quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF psychological domain), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), perceived stress (PSS-10), and insomnia (ISI). ANOVAs, Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests, and t-tests were applied to examine mental health indicators across different sociodemographic groups (age, sex, employment, income, physical activity, relationship status). RESULTS The sample comprised N=1,006 respondents (54% women) from all regions of the UK. Approximately 52% of respondents screened positive for a common mental disorder, and 28% screened positive for clinical insomnia. Mean scores and standard deviations were as follows: PHQ-9: M=9.0±7.7; GAD-7: M=8.0±6.5; ISI: M=10.4±7.0; PSS-10: M=17.7±7.9; WHO-QOL BREF: M=58.6±21.4; WHO-5 score M=13.0±6.0. Statistical analyses consistently indicated more severe mental health problems in adults under 35 years, women, people with no work, and low income (all p-values <.05). Mental health indices also varied across UK regions. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of depressive-, anxiety-, and insomnia symptoms is significantly higher in the UK, relative to pre-pandemic epidemiological data. Further studies are needed to clarify the causes for these high rates of mental health symptoms.","Pieh, Christoph; Budimir, Sanja; Delgadillo, Jaime; Barkham, Michael; Fontaine, Johnny R J; Probst, Thomas",Psychosomatic medicine,216,17

Yet our understanding of their biogenesis and functions remains limited. In the present study, through analysis of small RNA profile we have identified a distinct set of tRFs derived from pre-tRNA 3' trailers in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh7. Among those tRFs, tRF_U3_1, which is a 19-nucleotide-long chr10.tRNA2-Ser(TGA)-derived trailer, was expressed most abundantly in both Huh7 and cancerous liver tissues, being present primarily in the cytoplasm. We show that genetic loss of tRF_U3_1 does not affect cell growth and it is not involved in Ago2-mediated gene silencing. Using La/SSB knockout Huh7 cell lines, we demonstrate that this nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling protein directly binds to the 3' U-tail of tRF_U3_1 and other abundantly expressed trailers and plays a critical role in their stable cytoplasmic accumulation. The pre-tRNA trailer-derived tRFs capable of sequestering the limiting amounts of La/SSB in the cytoplasm rendered cells resistant to various RNA viruses, which usurp La/SSB with RNA chaperone activity for their gene expression. Collectively, our results establish the trailer-derived tRF-La/SSB interface, regulating viral gene expression.","Cho, Hee; Lee, Wooseong; Kim, Geon-Woo; Lee, Seung-Hoon; Moon, Jae-Su; Kim, Minwoo; Kim, Hyun Seok; Oh, Jong-Won",Nucleic acids research,216,28

Development of the National action plan for health security (NAPHS) began soon after the JEE, through multisectoral coordination and collaboration and with the support of a presidential instruction. The logic model approach was used to develop the NAPHS, and provided a robust framework to ensure that activities were linked to indicators at the various capacity levels delineated in the JEE. The NAPHS includes a comprehensive tool within which monitoring and evaluation are completely separated and different indicators applied. Furthermore, development of the NAPHS was done in parallel and in line with that of the National medium-term development plan 2020-2024, which included a focus on health system strengthening based on the primary health-care approach. An innovative approach taken in 2018 was the inclusion of emergency preparedness in the mandatory minimum service standards for provincial and district governments. These standards clearly articulate the importance of local emergency preparedness in Indonesia's decentralized governance through the development of contingency plans and simulation exercises for natural disasters and potential disease outbreaks. Development of the NAPHS has benefited from Indonesia's extensive experience in pandemic influenza preparedness planning and exercises, integrated with a national disaster management system. By signing the Delhi Declaration on Emergency Preparedness in the South-East Asia Region, Indonesia has signalled its commitment to implementing the NAPHS in full, focusing on enhanced emergency preparedness at all administrative levels.","Rai, Nyoman Kumara; Rim, Kwang Il; Wulandari, Endang Widuri; Subrata, Frieda; Sugihantono, Anung; Sitohang, Vensya",WHO South-East Asia journal of public health,216,6

Neonates and children are most vulnerable population to COVID-19 infection; however, the infection is usually milder and has a better prognosis in pediatric patients compared with adults. It remains unclear why pediatric population is less symptomatic than adults. Children frequently experience respiratory infections and their immune system is in developing stage. However, large proportion of the asymptomatic pediatric population may contribute to transmission. This review explored several aspects of COVID-19 infection such as its epidemiology, its molecular pathogenesis with respect to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and inflammatory mediators, intrauterine vertical transmission, imaging findings, and complications like cytokine release syndrome (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children). We also looked at prognostic factors and treatment modalities like corticosteroids, RNA replicate inhibitors, protease inhibitors, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, that is, acalabrutinib and convalescent plasma therapy. Since there is no strong evidence for the intrauterine transmission, early isolation should be performed to protect a neonate from a COVID-19 infected mother.

An asthma exacerbation is characterised by acute or subacute worsening of shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness and may be triggered by viral respiratory infection, poor compliance with usual medication, a change in the weather, or exposure to allergens or irritants. Most children with asthma have mild or moderate exacerbations and respond well to first-line therapy (inhaled short-acting beta-agonists and systemic corticosteroids). However, the best treatment for the small proportion of seriously ill children who do not respond to first-line therapy is not well understood. Currently, a large number of treatment options are available and there is wide variation in management. OBJECTIVES Main objective - To summarise Cochrane Reviews with or without meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of second-line treatment for children with acute exacerbations of asthma (i.e. after first-line treatments, titrated oxygen delivery, and administration of intermittent inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists and oral corticosteroids have been tried and have failed) Secondary objectives - To identify gaps in the current evidence base that will inform recommendations for future research and subsequent Cochrane Reviews - To categorise information on reported outcome measures used in trials of escalation of treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma in children, and to make recommendations for development and reporting of standard outcomes in future trials and reviews - To identify relevant randomised controlled trials that have been published since the date of publication of each included review METHODS: We included Cochrane Reviews assessing interventions for children with acute exacerbations of asthma. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search is current to 28 December 2019. We also identified trials that were potentially eligible for, but were not currently included in, published reviews. We assessed the quality of included reviews using the ROBIS criteria (tool used to assess risk of bias in systematic reviews). We presented an evidence synthesis of data from reviews alongside an evidence map of clinical trials. Primary outcomes were length of stay, hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, and adverse effects. We summarised all findings in the text and reported data for each outcome in 'Additional tables'. MAIN RESULTS We identified 17 potentially eligible Cochrane Reviews but extracted data from, and rated the quality of, 13 reviews that reported results for children alone. We excluded four reviews as one did not include any randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one did not provide subgroup data for children, and the last two had been updated and replaced by subsequent reviews. The 13 reviews included 67 trials; the number of trials in each review ranged from a single trial up to 27 trials. The vast majority of comparisons included between one and three trials, involving fewer than 100 participants. The total number of participants included in reviews ranged from 40 to 2630. All studies included children; 16 (24%) included children younger than two years of age. Most of the reviews reported search dates older than four years. We have summarised the published evidence as outlined in Cochrane Reviews. Key findings, in terms of our primary outcomes, are that (1) intravenous magnesium sulfate was the only intervention shown to reduce hospital length of stay (high-certainty evidence); (2) no evidence suggested that any intervention reduced the risk of intensive care admission (low- to very low-certainty evidence); (3) the risk of hospital admission was reduced by the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta2-agonists (moderate-certainty evidence), the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate (high-certainty evidence), and the use of inhaled heliox (low-certainty evidence); (4) the addition of inhaled magnesium sulfate to usual bronchodilator therapy appears to reduce serious adverse events during hospital admission (moderate-certainty evidence); (5) aminophylline increased vomiting compared to placebo (moderate-certainty evidence) and increased nausea and nausea/vomiting compared to intravenous beta2-agonists (low-certainty evidence); and (6) the addition of anticholinergic therapy to short-acting beta2-agonists appeared to reduce the risk of nausea (high-certainty evidence) and tremor (moderate-certainty evidence) but not vomiting (low-certainty evidence). We considered 4 of the 13 reviews to be at high risk of bias based on the ROBIS framework. In all cases, this was due to concerns regarding identification and selection of studies. The certainty of evidence varied widely (by review and also by outcome) and ranged from very low to high. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS This overview provides the most up-to-date evidence on interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children from Cochrane Reviews of randomised controlled trials. A vast majority of comparisons involved between one and three trials and fewer than 100 participants, making it difficult to assess the balance between benefits and potential harms. Due to the lack of comparative studies between various treatment options, we are unable to make firm practice recommendations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate appears to reduce both hospital length of stay and the risk of hospital admission. Hospital admission is also reduced with the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta2-agonists. However, further research is required to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapies. Due to the relatively rare incidence of acute severe paediatric asthma, multi-centre research will be required to generate high-quality evidence. A number of existing Cochrane Reviews should be updated, and we recommend that a new review be conducted on the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. Important priorities include development of an internationally agreed core outcome set for future trials in acute severe asthma exacerbations and determination of clinically important differences in these outcomes, which can then inform adequately powered future trials.","Craig, Simon S; Dalziel, Stuart R; Powell, Colin Ve; Graudins, Andis; Babl, Franz E; Lunny, Carole",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,216,16

We aimed to determine the incidence of chest tube clogging and the role of bedside assessment in identifying the potential for failure to drain. METHODS Data from 150 patients undergoing cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass from March to October 2011 were prospectively entered into a database. Chest tubes were visually inspected and functionally assessed at four time intervals (Hours 0, 2-4, 6-8 and at removal), defining need for clearance and presence of partial or complete obstruction. RESULTS Complete data were available for 100 patients. We assessed 234 chest tubes: pericardial (n = 158); pleural (n = 76). The incidence of chest tube clogging for the entire group was 36% (any tube completely clogged at any time), with increased prevalence of clogging observed in urgent and reoperative cases and in those with increased intraoperative blood use. Among 51 tubes resulted to have a thrombus formation observed inside the chest tube at removal, 44 were clogged primarily in the internal portion of the tube, meaning that clogging could not be confirmed by simple bedside inspection of the indwelling tube. CONCLUSIONS The chest tubes can become clogged at any time after their placement. The status of urgency, reoperations and use of blood products can be contributing factors increasing the incidence of chest tube clogging. Clinicians likely underestimate the prevalence of this failure to drain, as most clogging occurs in the internal portion of the tube.","Karimov, Jamshid H; Gillinov, A Marc; Schenck, Laura; Cook, Myra; Kosty Sweeney, Denise; Boyle, Edward M; Fukamachi, Kiyotaka",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,216,5

Areas covered: The present review provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the immune-related hypophysitis with focus on the elusive biological background, the wide spectrum of the epidemiological profile, the varying clinical aspects, and the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Expert opinion: Historically considered distinctive of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), the immune-related hypophysitis is increasingly correlated with the anti-programmed cell-death (PD) protein 1 (PD-1)/anti-PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) mAbs. The distinct phenotype of hypophysitis related to anti-PD1/anti-PD-L1 mAbs is highlighted with focus on the immune-related isolated adrenocorticotropic (ACTH) deficiency. The immune-related central diabetes insipidus is discussed as a rare aspect of anti-CTL-A4 mAbs-induced hypophysitis, recently related to anti-PD1/anti-PD-L1 mAbs as well. The present review builds on existing literature concerning immune-related hypophysitis underscoring the pending issues still to be addressed, including (i) pathogenesis; (ii) correlation with preexisting autoimmunity; (iii) predictive value; (iv) utility of high dose glucocorticoids; and (v) establishment of evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic protocols.

BACKGROUND Intraplaque hemorrhage releases free hemoglobin (Hb). Impaired Hb clearance induces oxidative stress leading to plaque progression. The binding of Hp to Hb attenuates iron-induced oxidative reactions. METHODS Twenty-six human aortic plaques were Hp genotyped. Hp2-2 plaques (n = 13) were compared with control (Hp1-1/2-1) (n = 13). The iron grade was measured by Perl's staining. Immunostaining was used to detect oxidation-specific epitopes (OSEs) reflecting oxidized phospholipids and malondialdehyde-like epitopes. The percentages of apoptotic cells and apoptotic morphological features were quantified. DNA fragmentation and active caspase-3 were measured by in situ end-labeling and immunohistochemistry, respectively. RESULTS In Hp2-2 plaques, iron content was increased (1.22 ± 0.15 vs. 0.54 ± 0.08; p < 0.0001) along with expression of oxidized phospholipid- (78.9 ± 5.8 vs. 38.8 ± 3.8; p < 0.0001), and malondialdehyde-like OSEs (93.9 ± 7.9 vs. 54.7 ± 3.9; p < 0.0001). The total percentages of apoptotic cells (11.9 ± 0.44 vs. 3.5 ± 0.28; p < 0.0001), nuclear fragmentation (11.8 ± 0.50 vs. 3.3 ± 0.26; p < 0.0001), nuclear condensation (10.9 ± 0.58 vs. 3.4 ± 0.20; p < 0.0001), chromatin margination (14.2 ± 0.57 vs. 6.5 ± 0.37; p < 0.0001), cytoplasmic blebs (1.6 ± 0.28 vs. 0.8 ± 0.14; p < 0.002), and eosinophilia (10.8 ± 0.74 vs. 4.2 ± 0.27; p < 0.0001) were increased in Hp2-2 plaques. Furthermore, DNA fragmentation (119.9 ± 1.40 vs. 57.5 ± 0.80; p < 0.001), and active caspase-3 density (84.7 ± 7.62 vs. 50.6 ± 7.49; p < 0.004) were increased in Hp2-2 plaques. Logistic regression analysis identified correlation between the percentage of apoptotic cells and the density of OSEs (r = 0.56; p < 0.003). CONCLUSIONS These findings provide insights into genetic predisposition to oxidative stress and the relationship between OSEs and macrophage apoptosis that may explain advanced atherosclerosis in human Hp2-2 plaques.","Purushothaman, K-Raman; Purushothaman, Meerarani; Levy, Andrew P; Lento, Patrick A; Evrard, Solene; Kovacic, Jason C; Briley-Saebo, Karen C; Tsimikas, Sotirios; Witztum, Joseph L; Krishnan, Prakash; Kini, Annapoorna; Fayad, Zahi A; Fuster, Valentin; Sharma, Samin K; Moreno, Pedro R",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,216,1

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with FMT failure and to develop and validate a prediction model for FMT failure. METHODS Patient characteristics, CDI history, FMT characteristics, and outcomes data for patients treated between 2011 and 2015 at three academic tertiary referral centers were prospectively collected. Early FMT failure was defined as non-response or recurrence of diarrhea associated with positive stool C. difficile toxin or PCR within 1 month of FMT. Late FMT failure was defined as recurrence of diarrhea associated with positive stool C. difficile toxin or PCR between 1 and 3 months of the FMT. Patient data from two centers were used to determine independent predictors of FMT failure and to build a prediction model. A risk index was constructed based on coefficients of final predictors. The patient cohort from the third center was used to validate the prediction model. RESULTS Of 328 patients in the developmental cohort, 73.5% (N=241) were females with a mean age of 61.4±19.3 years; 19.2% (N=63) had inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and 23.5% (N=77) were immunocompromised. The indication for FMT was recurrent CDI in 87.2% (N=286) and severe or severe-complicated in 12.8% (N=42). FMT was performed as an inpatient in 16.7% (N=54). The stool source was patient-directed donors in 40% (N=130) of cases. The early FMT failure rate was 18.6%, and the late failure rate was 2.7%. In the multivariable analysis, predictors of early FMT failure included severe or severe-complicated CDI (odds ratio (OR) 5.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.26-15.62), inpatient status during FMT (OR 3.78, 95% CI: 1.55-9.24), and previous CDI-related hospitalization (OR 1.43, 95% CI: 1.18-1.75); with each additional hospitalization, the odds of failure increased by 43%. Risk scores ranged from 0 to 13, with 0 indicating low risk, 1-2 indicating moderate risk, and ≥3 indicating high risk. In the developmental cohort, early FMT failure rates were 5.6% for low risk, 12.7% for moderate risk, and 41% for high-risk patients. Of 134 patients in the validation cohort, 57% (N=77) were females with a mean age of 66±18.1 years; 9.7% (N=13) had IBD, and 17.9% (N=24) were immunocompromised. The early FMT failure rate at 1 month was 19.4%, with an additional 3% failing by 3 months. In the validation cohort, FMT failure rates were 2.1% for low risk, 16.1% for moderate risk, and 35.7% for high risk patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for FMT failure was 0.81 in the developmental cohort and 0.84 in the validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS Severe and severe-complicated indication, inpatient status during FMT, and the number of previous CDI-related hospitalizations are strongly associated with early failure of a single FMT for CDI. The novel prediction model has good discriminative power at identifying individuals who are at high risk of failure after FMT therapy and may assist the treating physician in subsequent management plans.","Fischer, Monika; Kao, Dina; Mehta, Shama R; Martin, Tracey; Dimitry, Joseph; Keshteli, Ammar H; Cook, Gwendolyn K; Phelps, Emmalee; Sipe, Brian W; Xu, Huiping; Kelly, Colleen R",The American journal of gastroenterology,216,24

PLP blocks these pathways by affecting activation of the important signaling proteins in each pathway, IRF3 and NF-kappaB. We also show that the ubiquitin-like domain of PLP is necessary for pathway antagonism but not sufficient by itself to block these pathways regardless of the enzymatic activity of the protease. The potential mechanism of PLP antagonism and its role in pathogenesis are discussed.","Frieman, Matthew; Ratia, Kiira; Johnston, Robert E; Mesecar, Andrew D; Baric, Ralph S",Journal of virology,216,17

METHODS Fifteen participants were tested during a sprint before and after a fatigue electromyostimulation protocol was conducted on the quadriceps of one leg. Motor coordination was assessed by measuring myoelectrical activity, pedal force, and joint power. RESULTS The decrease in force-generating capacity of the quadriceps (-28.0% ± 6.8%) resulted in a decrease in positive knee extension power during the pedaling task (-34.4 ± 30.6 W; P = 0.001). The activity of the main nonfatigued synergist and antagonist muscles (triceps surae, gluteus maximus and hamstrings) of the ipsilateral leg decreased, leading to a decrease in joint power at the hip (-30.1 ± 37.8 W; P = 0.008) and ankle (-20.8 ± 18.7 W; P = 0.001). However, both the net power around the knee and the ability to effectively orientate the pedal force were maintained during the extension by reducing the coactivation and the associated negative power produced by the hamstrings. Adaptations also occurred in flexion phases in both legs, exhibiting an increased power (+17.9 ± 28.3 [P = 0.004] and +19.5 ± 21.9 W [P = 0.026]), associated with an improvement in mechanical effectiveness. CONCLUSION These results demonstrate that the nervous system readily adapts coordination in response to peripheral fatigue by (i) decreasing the activation of adjacent nonfatigued muscles to maintain an effective pedal force orientation (despite reducing pedal power) and (ii) increasing the neural drive to muscles involved in the flexion phases such that the decrease in total pedal power is limited.","Brøchner Nielsen, Niels-Peter; Hug, François; Guével, Arnaud; Colloud, Floren; Lardy, Julien; Dorel, Sylvain",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,216,1

According to theories of memory consolidation, memories are gradually reorganized, becoming supported by widespread, distributed cortical networks, particularly during postencoding periods of sleep. However, the effects of sleep on the organization of memories in the hippocampus itself remains less clear. In a 3-d study, participants encoded separate lists of word-image pairs differing in their opportunity for sleep-dependent consolidation. Pairs were initially studied either before or after an overnight sleep period, and were then restudied in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan session. We used multivariate pattern similarity analyses to examine fine-grained effects of consolidation on memory representations in the hippocampus. We provide evidence for a dissociation along the long axis of the hippocampus that emerges with consolidation, such that representational patterns for object-word memories initially formed prior to sleep become differentiated in anterior hippocampus and more similar, or overlapping, in posterior hippocampus. Differentiation in anterior hippocampal representations correlated with subsequent behavioral performance. Furthermore, representational overlap in posterior hippocampus correlated with the duration of intervening slow wave sleep. Together, these results demonstrate that sleep-dependent consolidation promotes the reorganization of memory traces along the long axis of the hippocampus.","Cowan, Emily T; Liu, Anli A; Henin, Simon; Kothare, Sanjeev; Devinsky, Orrin; Davachi, Lila",Learning & memory,216,1

DESIGN Randomized, controlled, study. SETTING University experimental laboratory. SUBJECTS Twenty-eight anesthetized, mechanically ventilated pigs. INTERVENTIONS Sixteen pigs were randomized to receive after 12 hours of fecal peritonitis fluid resuscitation and either norepinephrine (group NE; n = 8) or angiotensin II (group AT-II; n = 8) for 48 hours. A separate group (n = 8), treated with enalapril for 1 week before peritonitis and until study end, received fluids and norepinephrine (group E). The blood pressure dose-response to angiotensin II was evaluated in additional four nonseptic pigs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Blood pressure target (75-85 mm Hg) was reached in both NE and AT-II, and cardiac output increased similarly (NE: from 64 mL/kg/min [60-79 mL/kg/min] to 139 mL/kg/min [126-157 mL/kg/min]; AT-II from 79 mL/kg/min [65-86 mL/kg/min] to 145 mL/kg/min [126-147 mL/kg/min]; median, interquartile range). Renal plasma flow, prevalence of acute kidney injury, inflammation and coagulation patterns, and mitochondrial respiration did not differ between NE and AT-II. In group E, blood pressure targets were not achieved (mean arterial pressure at study end: NE: 81 mm Hg [76-85 mm Hg]; AT-II: 80 mm Hg [77-84 mm Hg]; E: 53 mm Hg [49-66 mm Hg], p = 0.002, compared to NE), whereas skeletal muscle adenosine triphosphate concentrations were increased. During resuscitation one animal died in groups AT-II and E. CONCLUSIONS Angiotensin II reversed sepsis-induced hypotension with systemic and regional hemodynamic effects similar to those of norepinephrine. Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme before sepsis worsened the hypotension but enhanced skeletal muscle adenosine triphosphate. Modifying the renin-angiotensin system in sepsis should be further evaluated.","Corrêa, Thiago D; Jeger, Victor; Pereira, Adriano José; Takala, Jukka; Djafarzadeh, Siamak; Jakob, Stephan M",Critical care medicine,216,1

Some hospitals have now combined infection prevention with face-to-face opportunities, i.e., requiring reservations for transitional care consultation and restricting pre-discharge conferences. Several hospitals started providing pre-discharge conferences using apps, where patients/family caregivers and care teams could have face-to-face discussions about medical and nursing care plans, goals, and preferences. However, building a relationship between patient/family and medical/nursing staff and providing decision-making, psychological support, and risk assessment generally performed in person are still in demand.

They comprise approximately 1% of all exocrine neoplasms and are classified according to their anatomical sites into main duct-type, branch duct-type, and mixed-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. Histological examination plays a crucial role in distinguishing and classifying intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms into gastric, intestinal, pancreatobiliary, and oncocytic subtypes. CASE PRESENTATION We present the case of a 70-year-old Syrian woman who was admitted to our hospital due to an intermittent epigastric pain accompanied by diarrhea and weight loss with a recent diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Following clinical, laboratory, and radiological examination, distal pancreatectomy involving the body and the tail of the pancreas was performed. Interestingly, histological examination of the resected specimens revealed the diagnosis of a mixed-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with a unique combination of gastric and pancreatobiliary subtypes. CONCLUSION To the best of our knowledge, the combination of multiple histological subtypes of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms has been recorded in a few studies with reference to the challenging histological detection. Herein, we report a rare case with a significant histological combination, highlighting the difficulties in differential diagnosis due to the absence of ancillary techniques, with a brief review on diagnostic methods, histological characteristics and surgical recommendations.","Ismail, Sawsan; Darwisho, Rama; Ali, Mohammed; Haidar, Maen; Houreih, Mohammad Adib; Alshehabi, Zuheir",Journal of medical case reports,216,16

DESIGN A pilot, time-series study. SETTING Neonatal intensive care unit. PATIENTS Infants with severe BPD who required MV. INTERVENTIONS MV with helium-oxygen and air-oxygen mixtures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Respiratory parameters, acid-base balance, oxygenation and vital signs were recorded at five time points: initially during MV with air-oxygen, after 15 and 60 min of helium-oxygen MV, and 15 and 60 min after return to air-oxygen MV. RESULTS 15 infants with BPD were enrolled. Helium-oxygen MV was well tolerated and was associated with a statistically significant increase in tidal volume, dynamic compliance and peak expiratory flow rate. An improvement in oxygenation and a decrease in fraction of inspired oxygen was also observed. During helium-oxygen MV there was a significant decrease in the oxygenation index and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference. The PaO2/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio increased significantly during helium-oxygen ventilation. A decrease in PaCO2 and an increase in pH were also observed during helium-oxygen administration, however this was not statistically significant. After ventilation with helium-oxygen was discontinued, the infants' respiratory function and oxygenation deteriorated and supplemental oxygen requirements increased accordingly. CONCLUSIONS Helium-oxygen MV is safe and resulted in improvement of respiratory function and oxygenation in infants with severe BPD requiring MV.","Szczapa, Tomasz; Gadzinowski, Janusz; Moczko, Jerzy; Merritt, T Allen",Archives of disease in childhood.

The patients' baseline characteristics and procedure details (time, tunnel length, myotomy length, depth, and location) were recorded. The primary outcome was clinical success (3-month post-procedure Eckardt score of ≤3). The secondary outcomes were technical success and adverse events. A paired Student's t-test was performed. Results Fifteen patients were included in this study. The technical success rate of myotomy using EES was 100%. Fellows participated in the myotomy in all cases. The clinical success rate was 93.3% (14/15). The mean pre-Eckardt score was 5.4±2.5, while the mean post-Eckardt score was 1.3±1.3, which indicated a significant improvement (p≤0.0001). The most common treatment-related adverse events were post-procedure pain (4, 26.7%) and symptomatic reflux disease (4, 26.7%).

We collected lung tissue samples from former smokers who underwent lung tissue resection. One hundred thirty samples from white subjects were included for this analysis. Regression models for sex as a predictor of methylation were adjusted for age, presence of COPD, smoking variables and technical batch variables revealed 710 associated sites. 294 sites demonstrated robust sex-specific methylation associations in foetal lung tissue. Pathway analysis identified 6 nominally significant pathways including the mitophagy pathway. Three CpG sites demonstrated a suggested interaction between sex and pack-years of smoking: GPR132, ANKRD44 and C19orf60. All of them were nominally significant in both male- and female-specific models, and the effect estimates were in opposite directions for male and female; GPR132 demonstrated significant association between DNA methylation and gene expression in lung tissue (P < 0.05).

On infection, oncolytic viruses (OVs) perturb the cellular autophagy machinery in infected tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. Currently, pharmacological modulation of autophagy in OV-infected tumor cells has been shown to augment OV-mediated antitumor effects in preclinical studies. Combination of OVs with autophagy modulators can, therefore, have many potential applications in the future research on targeting autophagy and novel anticancer therapies. AREAS COVERED This review provides a detailed description of known interactions between OVs and autophagy and summarizes the roles of autophagy in OV replication and cell lysis. The recent literature on targeting autophagy with either the autophagy inducers, such as rapamycin, or autophagy inhibitors, such as chloroquine, to increase OV-induced cytotoxicity is reviewed to help researchers in further investigations. The major challenge for investigators is to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the interplay between OV and the autophagy machinery and its effect on oncolysis. EXPERT OPINION Targeting the cellular autophagy machinery could be explored as a new therapeutic strategy to enhance OV-mediated antitumor effects in the future.","Meng, Songshu; Xu, Jiansheng; Wu, Yantao; Ding, Chan",Expert opinion on biological therapy,216,19

METHODS from April 2020, conventional smears during FNAC were ceased according to the World Health Organization recommendations due to the increased infection risk for operators, and a new liquid based cytology only protocol (LBC) was adopted. FNACs performed between April 2020 and July 2020 (COVID-19 group) were retrospectively compared with FNACs performed between December 2019 and March 2020 (pre-COVID-19 group). The distribution of the diagnostic categories among SIAPEC-IAP categories and the concordance between cytological and histological results were compared using the Chi-square test. RESULTS 90 and 82 thyroid nodules underwent FNAC in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 group. SIAPEC-IAP classification for samples in the pre-COVID-19 group and COVID-19 group were: TIR1 in 7/90 (8%) and 8/82 (10%), TIR1C in 0/90 (0%) and 6/82 (7%), TIR2 in 59/90 (66%) and 55/82 (67%), TIR3A 8/90 (9%) and 5/82 (6%), TIR3B 1/90 (1%) and 2/82 (3%), TIR4 5/90 (6%) and 1/82 (1%), TIR5 10/90 (12%) and 5/82 (7%) (p=0.081). 12/16 (75%) nodules in the Pre-COVID-19 group and 7/8 (88%) nodules in the COVID-19 group underwent surgery with no significant difference between cytological and histological diagnoses of potentially malignant lesions in the two groups (p=0.931). CONCLUSION the new LBC only protocol provided similar diagnostic accuracy in comparison with standard protocol, and can be effectively applied during a viral pandemic improving workers health and safety.","Rossi, Duccio; Belotti, Alessia; di Tonno, Clementina; Midolo, Valeria; Maffini, Fausto Antonio; Nicosia, Luca; De Fiori, Elvio; Mauri, Giovanni",Cytopathology : official journal of the British Society for Clinical Cytology,216,16

OBJECTIVE This systematic review and meta-analysis compares the effectiveness of TP anticoagulation services to face-to-face (FTF) anticoagulation services in the ambulatory care setting. METHODS A literature search for studies assessing the effectiveness of TP services was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central databases, from inception through November 18, 2020. Studies that compared TP with FTF anticoagulation services in the ambulatory care setting were included. Outcomes of interest included thromboembolic events, major bleeding, minor bleeding, any bleeding, warfarin international normalized ratio (INR) time in therapeutic range (TTR), frequency of extreme INR, anticoagulation-related emergency department visits, anticoagulation-related hospitalization, any hospitalization, and mortality. Relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference were calculated using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model. RESULTS Overall, 11 studies involving 8395 patients were included in the systematic review, and 9 studies were included in the pooled meta-analysis. Compared with FTF service, TP was associated with a lower risk of any bleeding and any hospitalization, with RRs of 0.65 (95% CI = 0.47 to 0.90; P = 0.01) and 0.59 (95% CI = 0.39 to 0.87; P = 0.01), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in TTR or the risk of extreme supratherapeutic INR, major bleeding, minor bleeding, or thromboembolic events between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS TP appears to be at least as effective as FTF anticoagulation services. Findings from this study support the utilization of TP practice models in ambulatory care anticoagulation management.","Tran, Rebecca J C; Yamzon, Joycelyn; Stewart, Tania L; Hernandez, Elvin A; Cao, Diana X",The Annals of pharmacotherapy,216,1

Controlling for interventions and ecological factors, we used linear regression to quantify testing's impact on COVID-19's average reproduction number, representing transmissibility, in 173 countries and territories, accounting for 99% of the world's COVID-19 cases, during March to June 2020. Amongst interventions, PCR testing had the greatest influence-a ten-fold increase in the ratio of tests to new cases reported reduced the average reproduction number by 9% across a range of testing levels. Our results imply that mobility reductions (e.g., shelter-in-place orders) were less effective in developing countries than in developed countries. Our results help explain how some nations achieved near-elimination of COVID-19 and the failure of lockdowns to slow COVID-19 in others. Our findings suggest that World Health Organization and other testing benchmarks are insufficient for COVID-19 control. Increased testing and isolation may represent the most effective, least costly alternative in terms of money, economic growth and human life for controlling COVID-19.

METHODS Eighty-three patients with 107 hepatic tumours who underwent RFA were divided into two groups: the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) group (55 patients with 69 lesions) and the colorectal liver metastases group (28 patients with 38 lesions). Post-ablation margins were calculated on 1-month follow-up contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Efficacy was evaluated at 1-month post-ablation, then at 3-month intervals for the first year and biannually thereafter. RESULTS The results of the log-rank test showed that the minimum threshold post-ablation margin of 0.4 cm (P = 0.020) and tumour size smaller than 2.5 cm (P = 0.001) significantly correlated with local control for the HCC group. In the colorectal liver metastases group, the results of the log-rank test showed that the minimum threshold post-ablation margin of 0.4 cm (P = 0.345) and tumour size smaller than 2.5 cm (P = 0.168) did not correlate with local control. CONCLUSION Percutaneous RFA is more effective in achieving local control in patients with HCCs than with colorectal liver metastases.","Liu, Chang-Hsien; Arellano, Ronald S; Uppot, Raul N; Samir, Anthony E; Gervais, Debra A; Mueller, Peter R",European radiology,216,27

OBJECTIVE To determine the level of knowledge, attitudes and practices of students of a health services' vocational school with regard to COVID-19. METHODS Cross-sectional study carried out between May and June 2020 in a university of the Turkish region. Data were collected through an online survey portal. RESULTS Four hundred and fifty-four questionnaires were completed and returned. Students of medical laboratory techniques and first aid and emergency medicine had significantly higher knowledge scores (p < 0.001). More than 43 % of the students (n = 201) used the TV as their main source of information on COVID-19. There was a positive attitude towards preventive measures such as avoiding crowded places and maintaining hand hygiene and social distance. CONCLUSIONS Health services vocational school students have good knowledge and positive attitude towards COVID-19. The main sources of information were the TV and social media. For this reason, more attention should be given to these issues in the curriculum in order for science-based information sources to be used.","Sirekbasan, Serhat; Ilhan, Aysegul Oglakci; Baydemir, Canan",Gaceta medica de Mexico,216,1

However, adequate individual targets are still poorly addressed, since patients have different perfusion thresholds. Bedside assessment of cerebral autoregulation may help to optimize individual CPP-guided treatment. OBJECTIVE To assess staff compliance and outcome impact of a new method of autoregulation-guided treatment (CPPopt) based on continuous evaluation of cerebrovascular reactivity (PRx). METHODS Prospective pilot study of severe TBI adult patients managed with continuous multimodal brain monitoring in a single Neurocritical Care Unit (NCCU). Every minute CPPopt was automatically estimated, based on the previous 4-h window, as the CPP with the lowest PRx indicating the best cerebrovascular pressure reactivity. Patients were managed with CPPopt targets whenever possible and otherwise CPP was managed following general/international guidelines. In addition, other offline CPPopt estimates were calculated using cerebral oximetry (COx-CPPopt), brain tissue oxygenation (ORxs-CPPopt), and cerebral blood flow (CBFx-CPPopt). RESULTS Eighteen patients with a total multimodal brain monitoring time of 5,520 h were enrolled. During the total monitoring period, 11 patients (61 %) had a CPPopt U-shaped curve, 5 patients (28 %) had either ascending or descending curves, and only 2 patients (11 %) had no fitted curve. Real CPP correlated significantly with calculated CPPopt (r = 0.83, p < 0.0001). Preserved autoregulation was associated with greater Glasgow coma score on admission (p = 0.01) and better outcome (p = 0.01). We demonstrated that patients with the larger discrepancy (>10 mm Hg) between real CPP and CPPopt more likely have had adverse outcome (p = 0.04). Comparison between CPPopt and the other estimates revealed similar limits of precision. The lowest bias (-0.1 mmHg) was obtained with COx-CPPopt (NIRS). CONCLUSION Targeted individual CPP management at the bedside using cerebrovascular pressure reactivity seems feasible. Large deviation from CPPopt seems to be associated with adverse outcome. The COx-CPPopt methodology using non-invasive CO (NIRS) warrants further evaluation.","Dias, Celeste; Silva, Maria João; Pereira, Eduarda; Monteiro, Elisabete; Maia, Isabel; Barbosa, Silvina; Silva, Sofia; Honrado, Teresa; Cerejo, António; Aries, Marcel J H; Smielewski, Peter; Paiva, José-Artur; Czosnyka, Marek",Neurocritical care,216,1

Herein we describe the impact of ERAS on quality of life (QOL) and cost for patients undergoing urologic oncology surgery. METHODS A systematic literature search using the MEDLINE, Scopus, Clinictrials.gov, and Cochrane Review databases for studies published between 1946 and 2020 was conducted. Articles were reviewed and assigned a risk of bias by two authors and were included if they addressed ERAS and either QOL or cost-effectiveness for patients undergoing urologic oncology surgery. RESULTS The literature search yielded a total of 682 studies after removing duplicates, of which 10 (1.5%) were included in the review. Nine articles addressed radical cystectomy, while one addressed ERAS and QOL for laparoscopic nephrectomy. Six publications assessed the impact of ERAS on QOL domains. Questionnaires used for assessment of QOL varied across studies, and timing of administration was heterogeneous. Overall, ERAS improved patient QOL during early phases of recovery within the realms of bowel function, physical/social/cognitive functioning, sleep and pain control. Costs were assessed in 4 retrospective studies including 3 conducted in the United States and one from China all addressing radical cystectomy. Studies demonstrated either decreased costs associated with ERAS as a result of decreased length of stay or no change in cost based on ERAS implementation. CONCLUSION While limited studies are published on the subject, ERAS implementation for radical cystectomy and laparoscopic nephrectomy improved patient-reported QOL during early phases of recovery. For radical cystectomy, there was a decreased or neutral overall financial cost associated with ERAS. Further studies assessing QOL and cost-effectiveness over the entire global period of care in a variety of urologic oncology surgeries are warranted.","Brooks, Nathan A; Kokorovic, Andrea; McGrath, John S; Kassouf, Wassim; Collins, Justin W; Black, Peter C; Douglas, James; Djaladat, Hooman; Daneshmand, Siamak; Catto, James W F; Kamat, Ashish M; Williams, Stephen B",World journal of urology,216,8

Current COVID-19 guidelines encourage ambulatory care where possible in this patient cohort. This paper aims to establish the impact of the Clinical Frailty Scale, anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapeutics and season variation on pre-pandemic admissions to help identify patients suitable for ambulatory epistaxis management. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study Setting Scottish Regional Health Board Participants Adult patients attending secondary care with epistaxis between March 2019 and March 2020. Main outcome measures Likelihood of epistaxis hospital admission based on Clinical Frailty Scale. RESULTS 299 epistaxis presentations were identified, of which 122 (40.8%) required admission. Clinical Frailty Scale of ≥4 had an increased likelihood of admission (OR 3.15 (95% CI:1.94 - 5.16), p<0.05). In the majority of presentations (66.2%), patients were taking either an antiplatelet or anticoagulant. Of these presentations, the use of an anticoagulant (OR: 2.00 (95% CI: 1.20-3.33), p<0.05 and dual antiplatelet (OR: 2.82 (95% CI: 1.02-7.86), p<0.05) demonstrated increased likelihood of admission. CONCLUSIONS We have shown that frailty increases the risk of admission in adult patients presenting with epistaxis. Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) could be utilized in risk stratification to identify suitable patients for outpatient management. Patients with CFS ≤ 3 could be considered for out-patient management of their epistaxis. It is likely that patients with CFS ≥4, on anticoagulant or dual antiplatelet will require admission.","Davies, Timothy; Alatsatianos, Anton; Afiq Mohd Slim, Mohd; Royce, William; Whymark, Andrew",Clinical otolaryngology : official journal of ENT-UK ; official journal of Netherlands Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology & Cervico-Facial Surgery,216,30

Historical literature dating back to the 1940s and earlier contains many reports of successful treatment of pneumonias with ionizing radiation. Although these were not randomized controlled trials, they do suggest a potential avenue for further investigation. Technical details in these reports however were limited. In this work we review the literature and identify details including nominal kilovoltage ranges, filtration, and focus-skin distances (FSDs). Using a freely available and benchmarked code, we generated spectra and used these as sources for Monte Carlo simulations using the EGSnrc software package. The approximate sources were projected through a radiologically anthropomorphic phantom to provide detailed dose distributions within a targeted lung volume (approximate right middle lobe). After accounting for the reported exposure levels, mean lung doses fell in a relatively narrow range: 30 - 80 cGy. Variation in patient dimensions and other details are expected to result in an uncertainty on the order of ± 20%. This result is consistent with the dose range expected to induce anti-inflammatory effects.","Kirkby, Charles; Mackenzie, Marc",Physics in medicine and biology,216,24

METHODS The databases including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Science-Direct, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for studies published up to December 2019. Articles that published as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and full-text articles published in English or other languages were included and participants were primi or multigravida women who were in active phase of labor. The intervention included HBB compared to placebo (normal saline) that was used during active phase of labor. Pooled estimates were measured using the fixed or random effect model, while the overall effect was reported in a mean difference (MD). All data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.3. RESULTS Twenty studies involving 3108 women were included in meta-analysis. Based on subgroup analysis by parity, use of HBB significantly reduced the duration of the first stage of labor in primigravida women (MD = - 57.73; 95% CI: [- 61.48, - 53.60]) and in multigravida women (MD = - 90.74; 95% CI: [- 97.24, - 84.24]). Administering HBB could reduce the second stages of labor in primigravidas and multigravidas about 6 min and 4 min respectively. Also, HBB reduced the duration of the third stage of labor in multigravidas about 3 min. APGAR score at one and 5 min after birth was not affected. The main maternal adverse effect was tachycardia and dry mouth. Labor duration in studies in which the participants were primi-and multigravida was not presented based on separate parities except for four papers, and the route of HBB administration was not the same across all studies. CONCLUSIONS Although, the effect of HBB was minimal when multigravidas and primigravidas women were considered together, the HBB was clinically effective in primigravida and multigravida women for shortening the first and the second stages of labor. Also, HBB could reduce the length of the third stage of labor in multigravidas.","Mohaghegh, Zaynab; Abedi, Parvin; Faal, Shahla; Jahanfar, Shayesteh; Surdock, Alayna; Sharifipour, Foruzan; Zahedian, Maryam",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,216,24

However, virtually all studies assessing the benefits of emotional support have focused on in-person support; the relative efficacy of digital support remains unclear. This study assessed a sample of young adults' negative emotions, digital and in-person support for those emotions, and success in regulating them 3 times per day for 14 days (N = 164; 6,530 collective measurement occasions). Participants' social surroundings at the time of each negative emotion and trait levels of social avoidance were also considered. Digital support was expected to be received more often and perceived as more effective for regulating negative emotions when participants were alone and higher in social avoidance. However, with the exception of those higher in social avoidance receiving less digital (and in-person) support, digital support was received and perceived as effective regardless of these factors, and its perceived effectiveness was on par with that of in-person support. For digital natives, digital support may be just as effective as the ""real thing"" and its benefits may not be restricted to isolated or socially avoidant users. Findings are discussed in relation to the emotional consequences and social constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Increasing antimicrobial resistance in equine practice and interest in promoting judicious use of antimicrobials has prompted reevaluation of drug selection and dosing strategies. OBJECTIVES To determine the frequency of and compare post-operative complications following elective synovial endoscopy between horses receiving different perioperative antimicrobial protocols. METHODS Records from the Colorado State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital were evaluated (2014-2018) and equine patients undergoing elective synovial endoscopy were identified. Patients undergoing endoscopy for sepsis or internal fixation were excluded. Patient signalment, clinician, joint and limb involved, perioperative antimicrobial regimen, number endoscopic portals and closure technique, and post-operative complications including incidence of joint infection were recorded. Generalized linear models were used to estimate the odds of post-operative complications. RESULTS Elective synovial endoscopies of 516 horses in 537 procedures evaluating 761 synovial structures were performed. No horses developed post-operative septic synovitis. Administration of post-operative antimicrobials, type used and patient sex were all significantly associated with increased risk of complications, which were predominantly gastrointestinal-related. Complication rates in horses receiving a single preoperative dose of cefazolin were lower than in horses receiving potassium penicillin, gentamicin or multiple doses. Complication rates were lower in females compared to castrated or intact males. Other factors evaluated (breed, age, surgeon, anaesthesia duration or hospitalization, joint/limb operated, number endoscopic portals) were not associated with increased risk of complications post-operatively in this case population. CONCLUSIONS Prophylactic perioperative antimicrobial protocols in equine practice deserve periodic reconsideration due to increased antimicrobial resistance. Prolonged antimicrobial usage beyond the time of surgery was unnecessary to prevent septic synovitis following synovial endoscopy in this case population and was furthermore associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal complications.","Pezzanite, Lynn M; Griffenhagen, Gregg M; Krause, Danielle M; Hendrickson, Dean A",Veterinary medicine and science,216,1

RESULTS From PEEP = 0 cmH2 O to best PEEP, Ppeak (37.4 ± 5.1 vs. 38.4 ± 4.9 cmH2 O) and Pplat (18.7 ± 3.3 vs. 20.4 ± 3.2 cmH2 O) increased slightly, resistance (28.1 ± 5.6 vs. 26.6 ± 5.0 cmH2 O/l/s) decreased slightly, and PEEPi (7.9 ± 2.3 vs. 1.5 ± 0.4 cmH2 O) decreased sharply. Compliance, heart rate, blood pressure, and SpO2 did not change. However, from best PEEP to PEEP = 15 cmH2 O, Ppeak (38.4 ± 4.9 vs. 44.9 ± 4.3 cmH2 O) and Pplat (20.4 ± 3.2 vs. 27.6 ± 3.3 cmH2 O) increased sharply, and systolic blood pressure (116 ± 13 vs. 99 ± 14 mmHg) and compliance (46.1 ± 18.1 vs. 37.7 ± 10.6 mL/cmH2 O) decreased sharply. At the same time, PEEPi (1.5 ± 0.4 vs. 0.7 ± 0.8 cmH2 O) decreased only slightly, and resistance, heart rate, and SpO2 did not change. CONCLUSIONS It is feasible to use Pplat as a simple way of determining the best PEEP in COPD patients.","Liang, Guopeng; Zhang, Zhongwei",The clinical respiratory journal,216,20

This underpins the importance of adequate dietary intake during this period of rapid biological development. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the current dietary intake and practices among adolescent girls (10⁻19 years) in LMICs. We searched relevant databases and grey literature using MeSH terms and keywords. After applying specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, 227 articles were selected for data extraction, synthesis, and quality assessment. Of the included studies, 59% were conducted in urban populations, 78% in school settings, and dietary measures and indicators were inconsistent. Mean energy intake was lower in rural settings (1621 ± 312 kcal/day) compared to urban settings (1906 ± 507 kcal/day). Self-reported daily consumption of nutritious foods was low; on average, 16% of girls consumed dairy, 46% consumed meats, 44% consumed fruits, and 37% consumed vegetables. In contrast, energy-dense and nutrient-poor foods, like sweet snacks, salty snacks, fast foods, and sugar-sweetened beverages, were consumed four to six times per week by an average of 63%, 78%, 23%, and 49% of adolescent girls, respectively. 40% of adolescent girls reported skipping breakfast. Along with highlighting the poor dietary habits of adolescent girls in LMIC, this review emphasizes the need for consistently measured and standardized indicators, and dietary intake data that are nationally representative.","Keats, Emily C; Rappaport, Aviva I; Shah, Shailja; Oh, Christina; Jain, Reena; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A",Nutrients,216,17

ANIMALS 47 client-owned dogs. PROCEDURES Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy was performed in dogs with UMRD (dilated cardiomyopathy [n = 25], atrioventricular block [6], and nonfamilial ventricular [4] and supraventricular arrhythmias [2]) or CHD (10) that required right ventricular catheterization. Biopsy samples were evaluated histologically, and PCR assays were used for detection of nucleic acid from 12 pathogens. RESULTS 197 biopsy samples were collected from dogs with UMRD (n = 172) or CHD (25). At least 1 pathogen was detected in 21 of 37 (57%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 41% to 71%) dogs with UMRD, and canine coronavirus was detected in 1 of 10 (10%; 95% CI, 2% to 40%) dogs with CHD. Dogs with UMRD were significantly more likely than dogs with CHD to have pathogens detected in biopsy samples (OR, 11.8; 95% CI, 1.3 to 103.0). The most common pathogens in dogs with UMRD were canine distemper virus, canine coronavirus, canine parvovirus 2, and Bartonella spp. No pathogens were detected in available blood samples from dogs with pathogens detected in biopsy samples. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Detection of nucleic acids from selected cardiotropic pathogens in myocardial tissue from dogs with UMRD suggested a possible association between the 2.

The diagnosis of venous disease has improved, and the treatment options have rapidly evolved over the past decade. To date, it is unclear to what extent vascular surgeons have become involved in the modern management of venous disorders. This survey was undertaken to explore the current interest and practice of vascular surgeons in the contemporary care of venous disease. METHODS A survey was administered via a web-based platform to active and candidate members of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS). The survey included 30 questions investigating the characteristics of venous surgeons and scope of venous practice. Open-ended questions were also included for commentary. RESULTS A total of 1879 surveys were sent to SVS members nationwide, and 385 members participated (response rate of 20.5%). The participants were mostly men (89.6%) with 37.7% practicing in an academic setting and 59.2% in private practice. The respondents treated superficial veins (92.9%) and deep veins (85.8%) in clinical practice, with 89.9% having their own vascular laboratory. A wide spectrum of interventions for superficial (91.9%), deep (85.8%), and perforator veins (52.7% endovenous, 19.4% subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery) are being performed by respondents. Only 26.2% had learned endovenous thermal ablation in their training program; however, over 96% of those performing venous interventions utilized this technique. Overall, the majority (85.5%) devoted 50% or less of practice to venous disorders. Respondents indicated that limitations to expansion of vein practices mainly involved challenges with third party payers, local competition, and existing large volumes of arterial interventions needing to be performed. Despite the widespread incorporation of venous disease into current vascular practices, 66.1% are not members of the American Venous Forum (AVF) or other venous society. Many believe there is still a lack of standardization of care and guidelines for venous disease. CONCLUSIONS The care of patients with venous disease has become more widespread among SVS members, with most offering both deep and superficial venous interventions as well as incorporation of minimally invasive techniques into their treatment armamentarium. Dissemination and incorporation of protocols and guidelines into clinical practice as well as postgraduate courses in venous disease may be areas in which the SVS could facilitate members' involvement in the care of patients with venous disease.","Bush, Ruth L; Gloviczki, Peter",Journal of vascular surgery.

Refinements in camera definition, surgical instrumentation, navigation, and surgical technique, including the dual surgeon team, have facilitated purely endonasal endoscopic approaches to the majority of the midline skull base that were previously difficult to access through the transsphenoidal microscopic approach. METHODS This review article looks at many of the articles from 2011 to 2014 citing endonasal endoscopic surgery with regard to approaches and reconstructive techniques, pathologies treated and outcomes, and new technologies under consideration. RESULTS Refinements in approach and closure techniques have reduced the risk of cerebrospinal fluid leak and infection. This has allowed surgeons to more aggressively treat a variety of pathologies. Four main pathologies with outcomes after treatment were identified for discussion: pituitary adenomas, craniopharyngiomas, anterior skull base meningiomas, and chordomas. Within all four of these tumor types, articles have demonstrated the efficacy, and in certain cases, the advantages over more traditional microscope-based techniques, of the endonasal endoscopic technique. CONCLUSIONS The endonasal endoscopic approach is a necessary tool in the modern skull base surgeon's armamentarium. Its efficacy for treatment of a wide variety of skull base pathologies has been repeatedly demonstrated. In the experienced surgeon's hands, this technique may offer the advantage of greater tumor removal with reduced overall complications over traditional craniotomies for select tumor pathologies centered near the midline skull base.","Lobo, Bjorn; Heng, Annie; Barkhoudarian, Garni; Griffiths, Chester F; Kelly, Daniel F",Surgical neurology international,216,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS We introduced a mentored ERP for radical cystectomy in January 2011. The programme underwent service evaluation and multiple changes in August 2012 that we define as marginal gains. We present a retrospective review of 133 consecutive patients undergoing open radical cystectomy, grouped according to the three stages of the ERP from October 2008 to April 2013: (1) non-ERP group (October 2008 to December 2010): n = 69; (2) ERP-1 group (January 2011 to July 2012): n = 37; and (3) ERP-2 group (August 2012 to April 2013): n = 27. Primary outcomes were length of hospital stay (LOS), readmission, morbidity at 90 days using the Clavien classification system and mortality. Secondary outcomes were time to flatus, ileus rates, re-operation rates and oncological outcomes. RESULTS There were no differences in patient demographics among any of the groups for: age, gender, BMI, American Society of Anesthesiologists score and the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. There were no differences in readmission, morbidity and mortality rates. The overall 90-day mortality was six patients (4.5%). There were significant differences in ileus rates between the non-ERP, the ERP-1 and the ERP-2 groups: 44.9% (31 patients), 29.7% (11 patients) and 14.8% (four patients), respectively (P = 0.017). There was a significant difference in the presence of pathological lymphadenopathy in the ERP-2 group: non-ERP group, 10.1%; ERP-1 group, 16.2%; and ERP-2 group, 44.4%; P = 0.002. There was also a difference in the mean (sd) lymph node yield in ERP-2: non-ERP group, 8.4 (5.4) nodes; ERP-1, 8.2 (6.4) nodes; and ERP-2, 16.7 (5.4) nodes (P < 0.001). The median (range) LOS was 14 (7-91) days, 10 (6-55) days and 7 (3-99) days in the non-ERP, ERP-1 and ERP-2 groups, respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Auditing an already successful ERP and implementing a number of marginal gains has led to a significant decrease in the median LOS for radical cystectomy. The LOS for open radical cystectomy at University Hospital Southampton has halved. In the second phase of our ERP, our median LOS is 7 days.","Smith, Julian; Meng, Zhao Wu; Lockyer, Richard; Dudderidge, Tim; McGrath, John; Hayes, Matthew; Birch, Brian",BJU international,216,16
96668,96668,96668,Level of Evidence during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Making the Case for Case Series and Case Reports.,15.781662,9.227895,2020-07-02,"INTRODUCTION Previous studies showed that rocker shoes with a stiff forefoot rocker profile significantly reduce peak plantar flexion moment at the ankle (PFM) and peak ankle dorsiflexion (DF). Both parameters are related to Achilles tendon and Plantar Fascia unloading. The shape of an outsole with a forefoot rocker is described with multiple rocker design parameters. The aim of this research is, to determine the relation between different forefoot rocker radii on peak DF and peak PFM at a self-selected walking speed. METHODS 10 participants walked in standard shoes and three experimental pairs of shoes with different forefoot rocker radii. Lower extremity kinematics and kinetics were collected while walking on an instrumented treadmill at preferred walking speed and analysed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) (α = .05; post-hoc α = .05/6). RESULTS Peak value analyses showed significant decreases in peak DF, peak PFM, and peak ankle power generation for the rocker conditions. No relevant significant differences were found in spatio-temporal parameters and total work at the ankle joint. SPM showed a significant decrease (% gait cycle) in DF (40-69 %), PFM (7-15 %; 41-68 %; 69-81 %), ankle power (10-15 %; 32-51 %; 55-64 %; 64-67 %; 72-80 %) and foot-to-horizontal angle (FHA) (0-4 %; 40-62 %; 92-100 %) and an increased shank-to-vertical angle (SVA) (44-84 %) for the rocker conditions. CONCLUSION The results of this study suggest that rocker shoes with a proximally placed apex significantly reduce DF and PFM during the third rocker compared with control shoes. This effect is mainly explained by a change in the FHA. Smaller radii cause the largest reductions in DF and PFM, so therefore, a uniform standardisation of the forefoot rocker radius is essential.","van Kouwenhove, L; Verkerke, G J; Postema, K; Dekker, R; Hijmans, J M",Gait & posture,216,1

Preventive methods like the use of personal protective equipment, isolation, social distancing, and chemoprophylaxis show limited benefit. Despite standard prophylaxis, many of the HCWs develop COVID-19. Medical ozone therapy has immunomodulatory, antioxidant and antiviral effect, and, therefore, it can be explored as prophylaxis for COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective controlled cohort study. IV ozonized saline was administered once a day for a total of 4 days in one month in addition to standard prophylaxis for COVID-19 to HCWs in a dedicated COVID hospital. Fresh ozonized saline was prepared for every administration and was given over 1 hour. RESULTS There were 235 HCWs, 64 received the ozone prophylaxis and 171 did not. The incidence of COVID-19 was significantly (p=0.04) lesser in HCWs that received ozone prophylaxis (4.6%) as compared to those who did not (14.03%). The benefit was seen irrespective of the risk of exposure. In the red zone, 8.69% of the HCWs who received ozone prophylaxis tested positive as opposed to 15.3% of those who did not. In the orange zone, 4.34% of the HCWs who received ozone prophylaxis tested positive, remarkably lesser than those who did not (20%). In the green zone, none of the HCWs who received ozone prophylaxis tested positive; however, 3.4% of the HCWs who did not receive ozone prophylaxis tested positive. No major adverse events were noted. CONCLUSIONS IV ozonized saline can be used in addition to the standard prophylactic regimen for the prevention of COVID-19 in HCWs. Prospective larger studies are required to establish the potency of IV ozonized saline as prophylaxis.","Sharma, A; Shah, M; Sane, H; Gokulchandran, N; Paranjape, A; Khubchandani, P; Captain, J; Shirke, S; Kulkarni, P",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,216,5

To assure high quality of skills, it is important to be able to measure and assess these skills. For that, it is necessary to determine aspects that indicate the difference between performances at various levels of proficiency. Measurement and assessment of skills in MIS are best done in an automatic and objective way. The goal of this study was to investigate a set of nine motion-related metrics for their relevance to assess psychomotor skills in MIS during the performance of a labyrinth task. METHODS Thirty-two surgeons and medical students were divided into three groups according to their level of experience in MIS; experts (>500 MIS procedures), intermediates (31-500 MIS), and novices (no experience in MIS). The participants performed the labyrinth task in the D-box Basic simulator (D-Box Medical, Lier, Norway). The task required bimanual maneuvering and threading a needle through a labyrinth of 10 holes. Nine motion-related metrics were used to assess the MIS skills of each participant. RESULTS Experts (n = 7) and intermediates (n = 14) performed significantly better than the novices (n = 11) in terms of time and parameters measuring the amount of instrument movement. The experts had significantly better bimanual dexterity, which indicated that they made more simultaneous movements of the two instruments compared to the intermediates and novices. The experts also performed the task with a shorter instrument path length with the nondominant hand than the intermediates. CONCLUSIONS The surgeon's performance in MIS can be distinguished from a novice by metrics such as time and path length. An experienced surgeon in MIS can be differentiated from a less experienced one by the higher ability to control the instrument in the nondominant hand and the higher degree of simultaneous (coordinated) movements of the two instruments.","Hofstad, Erlend Fagertun; Våpenstad, Cecilie; Chmarra, Magdalena Karolina; Langø, Thomas; Kuhry, Esther; Mårvik, Ronald",Surgical endoscopy,216,16

It is also ultimately key to social interactions8, innovation9,10 and productivity11. However, our quantitative understanding of the aggregate movements of individuals remains incomplete. Existing models-such as the gravity law12,13 or the radiation model14-concentrate on the purely spatial dependence of mobility flows and do not capture the varying frequencies of recurrent visits to the same locations. Here we reveal a simple and robust scaling law that captures the temporal and spatial spectrum of population movement on the basis of large-scale mobility data from diverse cities around the globe. According to this law, the number of visitors to any location decreases as the inverse square of the product of their visiting frequency and travel distance. We further show that the spatio-temporal flows to different locations give rise to prominent spatial clusters with an area distribution that follows Zipf's law15. Finally, we build an individual mobility model based on exploration and preferential return to provide a mechanistic explanation for the discovered scaling law and the emerging spatial structure. Our findings corroborate long-standing conjectures in human geography (such as central place theory16 and Weber's theory of emergent optimality10) and allow for predictions of recurrent flows, providing a basis for applications in urban planning, traffic engineering and the mitigation of epidemic diseases.","Schläpfer, Markus; Dong, Lei; O'Keeffe, Kevin; Santi, Paolo; Szell, Michael; Salat, Hadrien; Anklesaria, Samuel; Vazifeh, Mohammad; Ratti, Carlo; West, Geoffrey B",Nature,216,1

To promote physical activity (PA) effectively, it is necessary to consider structural influences. Previous research has shown the relevance of the built environment. However, sex/gender differences have yet not been considered. The aim of this systematic review was to identify built environmental determinants of PA by taking sex/gender into account. METHODS A systematic literature search was carried out using six electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, SportDiscus, PsycInfo, Scopus, Web of Knowledge) to identify studies analyzing the effect of changes in the built environment on PA, taking sex/gender into account. To be included, studies had to be based on quantitative data and a longitudinal study design. Changes in the built environment had to be objectively assessed. The methodological quality of the studies was examined using the QualSyst tool for examining risk of bias. RESULTS In total, 36 studies published since 2000 were included in this review. The data synthesis revealed that the majority of reviewed studies found the built environment to be a determinant of PA behavior for both, males and females, in a similar way. Creating a new infrastructure for walking, cycling, and public transportation showed a positive effect on PA behavior. Findings were most consistent for the availability of public transport, which was positively associated with overall PA and walking. The improvement of walking and cycling infrastructure had no effect on the overall level of PA, but it attracted more users and had a positive effect on active transportation. In women, the availability of public transport, safe cycling lanes, housing density, and the distance to daily destinations proved to be more relevant with regard to their PA behavior. In men, street network characteristics and road environment, such as intersection connectivity, local road density, and the presence of dead-end roads, were more important determinants of PA. CONCLUSION This review sheds light on the relevance of the built environment on PA. By focusing on sex/gender differences, a new aspect was addressed that should be further analyzed in future research and considered by urban planners and other practitioners.","Tcymbal, Antonina; Demetriou, Yolanda; Kelso, Anne; Wolbring, Laura; Wunsch, Kathrin; Wäsche, Hagen; Woll, Alexander; Reimers, Anne K",Environmental health and preventive medicine,216,1

A lack of serologic tools has hindered targeted studies of transmission. METHODS We studied 26 index patients with MERS-CoV infection and their 280 household contacts. The median time from the onset of symptoms in index patients to the latest blood sampling in contact patients was 17.5 days (range, 5 to 216; mean, 34.4). Probable cases of secondary transmission were identified on the basis of reactivity in two reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays with independent RNA extraction from throat swabs or reactivity on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against MERS-CoV S1 antigen, supported by reactivity on recombinant S-protein immunofluorescence and demonstration of neutralization of more than 50% of the infectious virus seed dose on plaque-reduction neutralization testing. RESULTS Among the 280 household contacts of the 26 index patients, there were 12 probable cases of secondary transmission (4%; 95% confidence interval, 2 to 7). Of these cases, 7 were identified by means of RT-PCR, all in samples obtained within 14 days after the onset of symptoms in index patients, and 5 were identified by means of serologic analysis, all in samples obtained 13 days or more after symptom onset in index patients. Probable cases of secondary transmission occurred in 6 of 26 clusters (23%).

We describe a technique for a SPA transabdominal combined with transanal approach to perform laparoscopic proctectomy with total mesorectal excision (TME) and intersphincteric resection of low rectal adenocarcinoma. METHOD Transanal intersphincteric resection was followed by laparoscopic abdominal proctectomy with TME. An SPA device was placed at the site of the future stoma through a 2.5-cm incision. A hand-sewn side-to-end coloanal anastomosis was performed and a terminal loop ileostomy was created at the site of the SPA device. RESULTS The procedure was performed on two healthy nonobese women who had not had previous abdominal surgery. The operating times were 195 and 210 min, and blood loss < 250 ml. The postoperative course was uneventful, with discharge on postoperative days 5 and 6. Pathological examination revealed adequate surgical margins and lymph node retrieval with an intact mesorectum. Four weeks after stoma closure, the scar in the right lower quadrant was 35 mm in one patient and 45 mm in the other, and the scar from the 5-mm port was barely visible. CONCLUSION This preliminary experience shows that proctectomy with TME and intersphincteric resection can be safely performed using only two ports.","Gaujoux, S; Bretagnol, F; Au, J; Ferron, M; Panis, Y",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,216,19

The efficacies of allspice oil, lemongrass oil, and citral were evaluated against the nonenveloped murine norovirus (MNV), a human norovirus surrogate. The antiviral mechanisms of action were also examined using an RNase I protection assay, a host cell binding assay, and transmission electron microscopy. All three antimicrobials produced significant reductions (P ≤ 0.05) in viral infectivity within 6 h of exposure (0.90 log10 to 1.88 log10). After 24 h, the reductions were 2.74, 3.00, and 3.41 log10 for lemongrass oil, citral, and allspice oil, respectively. The antiviral effect of allspice oil was both time and concentration dependent; the effects of lemongrass oil and citral were time dependent. Based on the RNase I assay, allspice oil appeared to act directly upon the viral capsid and RNA. The capsids enlarged from ≤ 35 nm to up to 75 nm following treatment. MNV adsorption to host cells was not significantly affected. Alternatively, the capsid remained intact following exposure to lemongrass oil and citral, which appeared to coat the capsid, causing nonspecific and nonproductive binding to host cells that did not lead to successful infection. Such contrasting effects between allspice oil and both lemongrass oil and citral suggest that though different plant compounds may yield similar reductions in virus infectivity, the mechanisms of inactivation may be highly varied and specific to the antimicrobial. This study demonstrates the antiviral properties of allspice oil, lemongrass oil, and citral against MNV and thus indicates their potential as natural food and surface sanitizers to control noroviruses.","Gilling, Damian H; Kitajima, Masaaki; Torrey, Jason R; Bright, Kelly R",Applied and environmental microbiology,216,0

This report presents a case in which abdominal muscle activities were accurately and quantitatively measured using ultrasonography (US) and surface electromyography in a patient with abdominal pseudohernia. PATIENT CONCERNS A 62-year-old man presented with a marked protrusion on the left abdomen with increasing abdominal pressure. DIAGNOSES First, the thickness of the abdominal muscle was measured with US while the patient constantly blew the positive expiratory pressure device. When the force was applied to the abdomen, the mean thickness of the muscle layer on the lesion site was found to be thinner. Second, the activities of the abdominal muscles were measured using surface electromyography by attaching electrodes to 8 channels at the same time. When the same pressure was applied on both sides of the abdomen, more recruitment occurred to compensate for muscle weakness at the lesion site. Through the previous 2 tests, the decrease in muscle activity in the lesion area could be quantitatively evaluated. Third, the denervation of the muscle was confirmed using US-guided needle electromyography. INTERVENTIONS The patient in this case was wearing an abdominal binder. In addition, he had been training his abdominal muscles through McGill exercise and breathing exercises such as with a positive expiratory pressure device. OUTCOMES The patient was able to understand his symptoms. A follow-up test will be performed to see if there is any improvement. LESSONS By using these outstanding assessment methods, proper diagnosis and rehabilitation treatment strategies can be developed.","Choi, Min Soo; Jang, Myung Hun; Lee, Byeong Ju; Shin, Yong Beom; Kim, Sang Hun",Medicine,216,1

However, previous studies haven't accounted for the influence of metabolic thresholds on fatigability. This study is the first to test whether sex differences in fatigability exist when exercise intensity is normalised relative to a metabolic threshold: the critical intensity derived from assessment of the intensity-duration relationship during intermittent, isometric knee extensor contractions. We show that critical intensity in females occured at a higher percentage of maximum force compared to males. Furthermore, females demonstrated greater fatigue resistance at exercise intensities above and below this metabolic threshold. Our data suggests that the sex difference was mediated by lesser deoxygenation of the knee-extensors during exercise. These data highlight the importance of accounting for metabolic thresholds when comparing fatigability between sexes, whilst emphasising the notion that male data is not generalisable to female populations. ABSTRACT Females are less fatigable than males during isometric exercise at intensities relative to maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), however whether a sex difference in fatigability exists when exercise is prescribed relative to a critical intensity is unknown. This study established the intensity-duration relationship, and compared fatigability and recovery between sexes following intermittent isometric contractions normalised to critical intensity. Twenty participants (10 females) completed four intermittent isometric knee extension trials to task failure to determine critical intensity and the curvature constant (W'), followed by fatiguing tasks at +10 and -10% relative to critical intensity. Neuromuscular assessments were completed at baseline and for 45 min post-exercise. Non-invasive neurostimulation, near-infrared spectroscopy, and non-invasive haemodynamic monitoring were used to elucidate the physiological mechanisms responsible for sex differences. Females demonstrated a greater critical intensity relative to MVC than males (25 ± 3 vs. 21 ± 2% MVC, P = 0.003), with no sex difference for W' (18,206 ± 6,331 vs. 18,756 ± 5,762 N.s, P = 0.850). Time to task-failure was greater for females (62.37 ± 17.25 vs. 30.43 ± 12.75 min, P < 0.001) during the +10% trial, and contractile function recovered faster post-exercise (P = 0.034). During the -10% trial females experienced less contractile dysfunction (P = 0.011). Throughout the +10% trial, females demonstrated lesser decreases in deoxyhaemoglobin (P = 0.007) and an attenuated exercise pressor reflex. These data show that a sex difference in fatigability exists even when exercise is matched for critical intensity. We propose that greater oxygen availability during exercise permits females to sustain a higher relative intensity than males, and is an explanatory factor for the sex difference in fatigability during intermittent, isometric contractions.

This work aims to survey commonly available mask materials to provide an overview of potential exposure. A total of 19 mask materials were analyzed using a nontargeted analysis two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC)-mass spectrometric (MS) workflow. Traditionally, there has been a lack of GCxGC-MS automated high-throughput screening methods, resulting in trade-offs with throughput and thoroughness. This work addresses the gap by introducing new machine learning software tools for high-throughput screening (Floodlight) and subsequent pattern analysis (Searchlight). A recursive workflow for chemical prioritization suitable for both manual curation and machine learning is introduced as a means of controlling the level of effort and equalizing sample loading while retaining key chemical signatures. Manual curation and machine learning were comparable with the mask materials clustering into three groups. The majority of the chemical signatures could be characterized by chemical class in seven categories: organophosphorus, long chain amides, polyethylene terephthalate oligomers, n-alkanes, olefins, branched alkanes and long-chain organic acids, alcohols, and aldehydes. The olefin, branched alkane, and organophosphorus components were primary contributors to clustering, with the other chemical classes having a significant degree of heterogeneity within the three clusters. Machine learning provided a means of rapidly extracting the key signatures of interest in agreement with the more traditional time-consuming and tedious manual curation process. Some identified signatures associated with plastics and flame retardants are potential toxins, warranting future study to understand the mask exposure route and potential health effects.","Favela, Kristin A; Hartnett, Michael J; Janssen, Jake A; Vickers, David W; Schaub, Andrew J; Spidle, Heath A; Pickens, Keith S",Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry,216,27

METHODS An anastomosis was constructed in male Wag/Rij rats after intraluminal injection of 2 x 10(6) CC531 tumour cells. The biodistribution of (111)In-labelled MG1 monoclonal antibody was assessed after intraperitoneal administration. The therapeutic efficacy of (177)Lu-labelled MG1 (74 MBq per rat), administered on the day of surgery (D0, n = 13) or 5 days later (D5, n = 13), was compared with that of carrier only (n = 13). The primary endpoint was perianastomotic tumour growth 28 days after surgery. RESULTS (111)In-labelled MG1 preferentially accumulated in perianastomotic CC531 tumours. RIT resulted in a transient reduction in bodyweight in both treatment groups compared with controls, but there were no other signs of clinical discomfort. No macroscopic or microscopic perianastomotic tumour growth was found in eight of 11 animals in the D0 group and 11 of 13 in the D5 group, whereas 11 of 13 controls had macroscopic tumour (P = 0.011 and P = 0.001 respectively).

DESIGN Data from a series of random-digit-dial telephone surveys were analysed. A time series analysis tested the association between levels of worry and the volume of media reporting on the start day of each survey. Cross-sectional regression analyses assessed the relationships between likely vaccine uptake or behaviour and predictor variables. SETTING Thirty-six surveys were run at, on average, weekly intervals across the UK between 1 May 2009 and 10 January 2010. Five surveys (run between 14 August and 13 September) were used to assess likely vaccine uptake. Five surveys (1-17 May) provided data relating to other behaviours. PARTICIPANTS Between 1047 and 1173 people aged 16 years or over took part in each survey: 5175 participants provided data about their likely uptake of the swine flu vaccine; 5419 participants provided data relating to other behaviours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES All participants were asked to state how worried they were about the possibility of personally catching swine flu. Subsets were asked how likely they were to take up a swine flu vaccination if offered it and whether they had recently carried tissues with them, bought sanitising hand gel, avoided using public transport or had been to see a general practitioner, visited a hospital or called NHS Direct for a flu-related reason. RESULTS The percentage of 'very' or 'fairly' worried participants fluctuated between 9.6% and 32.9%. This figure was associated with the volume of media reporting, even after adjusting for the changing severity of the outbreak [chi2(1) = 6.6, p = 0.010, coefficient for log-transformed data = 2.6]. However, this effect only occurred during the UK's first summer wave of swine flu. In total, 56.1% of respondents were very or fairly likely to accept the swine flu vaccine. The strongest predictors were being very worried about the possibility of oneself [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.2 to 7.0] or one's child (aOR 8.0, 95% CI 4.6 to 13.9) catching swine flu. Overall, 33.1% of participants reporting carrying tissues with them, 9.5% had bought sanitising gel, 2.0% had avoided public transport and 1.6% had sought medical advice. Exposure to media coverage or advertising about swine flu increased tissue carrying or buying of sanitising hand gel, and reduced avoidance of public transport or consultation with health services during early May 2009. Path analyses showed that media coverage and advertising had these differential effects because they raised the perceived efficacy of hygiene behaviours but decreased the perceived efficacy of avoidance behaviours. CONCLUSIONS During the swine flu outbreak, uptake rates for protective behaviours and likely acceptance rates for vaccination were low. One reason for this may in part be explained by was the low level of public worry about the possibility of catching swine flu. When levels of worry are generally low, acting to increase the volume of mass media and advertising coverage is likely to increase the perceived efficacy of recommended behaviours, which, in turn, is likely to increase their uptake.","Rubin, G J; Potts, H W W; Michie, S",Health technology assessment,216,1

The lack of exposure to transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic hysterectomy during training, in addition to a poorly defined learning curve, further deters interested physicians from applying this technique to daily practice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the learning curve and perioperative outcome of transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic hysterectomy by an experienced endoscopist. METHODS A total of 240 cases of transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic hysterectomies with or without adnexectomy for various benign gynecologic diseases were included. Demographic data and various perioperative parameters were reviewed from the prospectively collected database. Operative time was set as a surrogate marker for surgical competency. The learning curve was evaluated using the cumulative sum method. RESULTS The overall mean operative time (OT) was 76.5 min ± 22.4. Four unique phases of the learning curve were derived using cumulative sum analysis: the mean OT of phase I (the initial learning curve of 20 cases) was 86.3 ± 23.7 min, phase II (acquisition of competence of 80 cases) was 71.0 ± 21.4 min, phase III (proficiency and plateau of 80 cases) was 76.0 ± 20.4 min, and phase IV (post-learning in which more challenging cases were managed) was 81.3 ± 23.6 min. No major complications were encountered. One case in phase III converted to laparoscopy due to difficulty in performing anterior colpotomy. CONCLUSION Our data demonstrated four distinct phases of the learning curve of transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic hysterectomy. In a well-trained endoscopist, surgical competence in transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic hysterectomy can be reached after 20 cases.","Wang, Chin-Jung; Go, Justina; Huang, Hui-Yu; Wu, Kai-Yun; Huang, Yi-Ting; Liu, Yu-Cheng; Weng, Cindy Hsuan",BMC surgery,216,17

Anticholinergic agents are the mainstay of pharmacological treatment of OAB; however, many anticholinergics can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and may cause central nervous system (CNS) effects, including cognitive deficits, which can be especially detrimental in older patients. Many anticholinergics have the potential to cause adverse CNS effects due to muscarinic (M(1)) receptor binding in the brain. Of note, permeability of the BBB increases with age and can also be affected by trauma, stress, and some diseases and medications. Passive crossing of a molecule across the BBB into the brain is dependent upon its physicochemical properties. Molecular characteristics that hinder passive BBB penetration include a large molecular size, positive or negative ionic charge at physiological pH, and a hydrophilic structure. Active transport across the BBB is dependent upon protein-mediated transporter systems, such as that of permeability-glycoprotein (P-gp), which occurs only for P-gp substrates, such as trospium chloride, darifenacin and fesoterodine. Reliance on active transport can be problematic since genetic polymorphisms of P-gp exist, and many commonly used drugs and even some foods are P-gp inhibitors or are substrates themselves and, due to competition, can reduce the amount of the drug that is actively transported out of the CNS. Therefore, for drugs that are preferred not to cross into the CNS, such as potent anticholinergics intended for the bladder, it is optimal to have minimal passive crossing of the BBB, although it may also be beneficial for the drug to be a substrate for an active efflux transport system. Anticholinergics demonstrate different propensities to cross the BBB. Darifenacin, fesoterodine and trospium chloride are substrates for P-gp and, therefore, are actively transported away from the brain. In addition, trospium chloride has not been detected in cerebrospinal fluid assays and does not appear to have significant CNS penetration. This article reviews the properties of anticholinergics that affect BBB penetration and active transport out of the CNS, discusses issues of increased BBB permeability in patients with OAB, and examines the clinical implications of BBB penetration on adverse events associated with anticholinergics.","Chancellor, Michael B; Staskin, David R; Kay, Gary G; Sandage, Bobby W; Oefelein, Michael G; Tsao, Jack W",Drugs & aging,216,1

METHODS For women with >10 years of follow-up after anterior vaginal wall suspension (AVWS) for bothersome SUI associated with an anterior compartment prolapse, questionnaire scores from their last clinic encounter were compared with their scores from a standardized telephone interview at long-term follow-up. The validated questionnaires were Urinary Distress Inventory 6-Short Form (UDI-6), International Incontinence Questionnaire 7-Short Form (IIQ-7), and Quality of Life (QoL). RESULTS Eighty-four women underwent a telephone interview (median follow-up: 13.8 years, interquartile range [IQR]: 12.2-17) after AVWS. The median difference between telephone and clinic visit was 10.2 years (IQR: 6.1-12.2). The clinic UDI-6 total score remained low but was higher than the phone score (mean difference 1.2, P = .0023). The UDI-6 Q2, Q3, Q5, IIQ-7, and QoL scores did not significantly differ between clinic and phone. For ""incontinent"" AVWS patients (UDI-6 Q3 ≥ 2), there was a larger difference between clinic and phone UDI-6 total score (P < .0001), while ""dry"" patients (UDI-6 Q3 ≤ 1) responded similarly. CONCLUSIONS In women who would otherwise be LTF after anti-incontinence native tissue repair AVWS, UDI-6 total score varied slightly between last clinic and long-term follow-up phone interviews, but QoL and IIQ-7 remained similar.","Kuprasertkul, Amy; Christie, Alana L; Zimmern, Philippe",Lower urinary tract symptoms,216,28

Chest sonography plays a key role in the approach for this group of patients, through extended and focused evaluation with trauma sonography (E-FAST). OBJECTIVES To establish the diagnostic performance of the extension of the thoracic spine sign using chest sonography in trauma to diagnose hemothorax and compare it with the gold standard test chest computed tomography (CT). METHODS This prospective observational study was conducted over 1 year. Patients who attended the emergency room with closed or penetrating thoracic or thoraco-abdominal trauma, an indication for a chest CT as part of a diagnostic evaluation according to institutional protocols, and who previously underwent a chest sonogram to determine the extent of the thoracic spine sign to diagnose hemothorax. Sonographic results were compared to a radiologist's interpretation of the chest CT. The radiologists were blinded to the initial sonogram interpretation. RESULTS Seventy-six patients were enrolled with an average age of 32 years. They mainly had closed trauma, which accounted for 77.6% of samples, and 222 chest images were taken. The sensitivity and specificity for this study were 78.7% and 92.6%, respectively, with a positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 65% and 97.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Extension of the thoracic spine sign allows rapid identification of the presence, and more precisely, the absence of pleural effusion. This, therefore, allows an appropriate diagnosis and approach in the emergency room in patients with chest trauma.","Vargas, Carlos A; Quintero, Jaime; Figueroa, Roger; Castro, Andrés; Watts, Fredy A",European journal of trauma and emergency surgery : official publication of the European Trauma Society,216,1

Our aim was to conduct a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature that combined the concepts of stigma, obesity, and policy. We searched PsycINFO, Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed articles amalgamating terms relevant to stigma, obesity, and policy. Of 3219 records identified, 47 were included in the narrative synthesis. Two key types of studies emerged: studies investigating factors associated with support for obesity-related policies and those exploring policy implementation and evaluation. We found that support for nonstigmatizing obesity-related policies was higher when obesity was attributed as an environmental rather than individual problem. An undercurrent theme suggested that views that blame individuals for their obesity were associated with support for punitive policies for people living in larger bodies. Real-world policies often implicitly condoned stigma through poor language choice and conflicting discourse. Our findings inform recommendations for policy makers that broader socioecological stigma-reduction approaches are needed to fully address the issue of weight stigma in obesity-related policies. Efforts are needed in the research and policy sectors to understand how to improve the design and support of nonstigmatizing obesity-related policies.","Hill, Briony; Bergmeier, Heidi; Incollingo Rodriguez, Angela C; Barlow, Fiona Kate; Chung, Alexandra; Ramachandran, Divya; Savaglio, Melissa; Skouteris, Helen",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,216,1

Despite focused efforts to achieve this balance, the frequency of both thrombotic and bleeding events remains high. Anticoagulation is complicated to manage in this population due to the complexities of the hemostatic system that are compounded by age-related developmental hemostatic changes, variable effects of the etiology of critical illness on hemostasis, and blood-circuit interaction. Lack of high-quality data to guide anticoagulation management in ECMO patients results in marked practice variability among centers. One aspect of anticoagulation therapy that is particularly challenging is the use of antithrombin (AT) supplementation for heparin resistance. This is especially controversial in the neonatal and pediatric population due to the baseline higher risk of bleeding in this cohort. The indication for AT supplementation is further compounded by the potential inaccuracy of the diagnosis of heparin resistance based on the standard laboratory parameters used to assess heparin effect. With concerns regarding the adverse impact of bleeding and thrombosis, clinicians and institutions are faced with making difficult, real-time decisions aimed at optimizing anticoagulation in this setting. In this clinically focused review, the authors discuss the complexities of anticoagulation monitoring and therapeutic intervention for patients on ECMO and examine the challenges surrounding AT supplementation given both the historical and current perspectives summarized in the literature on these topics.","Chlebowski, Meghan M; Baltagi, Sirine; Carlson, Mel; Levy, Jerrold H; Spinella, Philip C",Critical care,216,1

Currently, there are no official guidelines on the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19. Lopinavir/ritonavir is a licensed antiviral treatment against HIV and has shown activity against other coronaviruses. OBJECTIVE In this study, we review the evidence of the use of lopinavir/ritonavir as a potential treatment candidate against COVID-19. METHOD This systematic review has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020182067). A systematic search of the literature for the observational and randomized controlled trial was conducted in PubMed, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar through May 2nd, 2020. Two reviewers independently searched and selected. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Jadad scale, Newcastle-Ottawa Quality assessment tool, and National Institute of Health quality assessment tool. RESULTS A total of 1,965 articles were screened from which 6 articles were selected. Of 6 articles that were included in this study, 4 reported no significant benefit in clinical improvement with lopinavir/ritonavir when compared to standard care of treatment, while 2 studies reported otherwise. Lopinavir/ritonavir was also not associated with a reduction of 28-day mortality rate as reported by 1 included study. Most included studies reported gastrointestinal symptoms as side effects from lopinavir/ritonavir therapy. CONCLUSION There is not yet enough evidence to support the regular use of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of COVID19.

In this paper, we describe some problems that empirical bioethics researchers may face; these problems are related to a tension between the different poles on the spectrum of scientific paradigms, namely a positivist and interpretive stance. We explore the ideas of narrative construction, 'genres' in medicine and dominant discourses in relation to empirical research. We also reflect on the loss of depth and context that may occur with thematic or content analyses of interviews, and discuss the need for transparency about methodologies in empirical bioethics. Drawing on insights from narrative approaches in the social sciences and the clinical-educational discipline of Narrative Medicine, we further clarify these problems and suggest a narrative approach to qualitative interviewing in empirical bioethics that enables researchers to 'listen (and read) in new ways'. We then show how this approach was applied in the first author's research project about euthanasia decision-making. In addition, we stress the important ethical task of scrutinizing methodologies and meta-ethical standpoints, as they inevitably impact empirical outcomes and corresponding ethical judgments. Finally, we raise the question whether a 'diagnostic', rather than a 'problem-solving', mindset could and should be foregrounded in empirical ethics, albeit without losing a commitment to ethics' normative task, and suggest further avenues for theorizing about listening and epistemic (in)justice in relation to empirical (bio)ethics.","Roest, Bernadette; Milota, Megan; Leget, Carlo",BMC medical ethics,216,26

The purpose of this article is to review the experiences of an integrated urban health system, exploring the strategic tactics to ensure effective communication between team members, patient and family engagement in discharge planning, establishing and maintaining trust, connecting patients to appropriate next level of care services, and providing transitional care management support. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTINGS The Covid-19 pandemic response stimulated the rapid transformation of the acute care management model amidst the tremendous challenge of meeting the discharge planning needs of the hospitalized population in one large, urban, integrated health care system. FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS Patients transitioning to the community setting following discharge are vulnerable and at risk for adverse sequelae, and transitional care management that does not end when the patient leaves the hospital setting is integral to promoting positive patient outcomes (Naylor, Aiken, Kurtzman, Olds, & Hirschman, 2011). The care management approach during the pandemic in one health care system precipitously shifted to an entirely virtual, remote model, and the team continued to provide transitional care support for hospitalized patients to avoid the common pitfalls that are associated with unfavorable outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE The insights gleaned from one health system's experiences during the pandemic are transferable to other facets of care management in routine circumstances, with emphasis on the avoidance of the common care management snares that lead to less than optimal patient outcomes. The development and implementation of multifaceted interventions, with the goals of supporting health-promoting behavior changes and self-care capacity for at risk populations, are relevant in the current health care environment.","Chovanec, Kelli; Howard, Nicole R",Professional case management,216,20

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed data from 76 patients with rectal cancer who underwent LELAPE from March 2013 to May 2016. Patients were classified into the modified primary closure group (32 patients) and the biological mesh closure group (44 patients). The total operating time, reconstruction time, postoperative stay duration, total cost, postoperative complications and tumor recurrence were compared. RESULTS All surgery was successfully performed. The pelvic reconstruction time was 14.6 ± 3.7 min for the modified primary closure group, which was significantly longer than that of the biological mesh closure group (7.2 ± 1.9 min, P < 0.001). The total operating time was not different between the two groups (236 ± 20 min vs 248 ± 43 min, P = 0.143). The postoperative hospital stay duration was 8.1 ± 1.9 d, and the total cost was 9297 ± 1260 USD for the modified primary closure group. Notably, both of these categories were significantly lower in this group than those of the biological mesh closure group (P = 0.001 and P = 0.003, respectively). There were no differences observed between groups when comparing other perioperative data, long-term complications or oncological outcomes. CONCLUSION The modified primary closure method for reconstruction of the pelvic floor in LELAPE for low rectal cancer is technically feasible, safe and cost-effective.","Wang, Yan-Lei; Zhang, Xiang; Mao, Jia-Jia; Zhang, Wen-Qiang; Dong, Hao; Zhang, Fan-Pei; Dong, Shuo-Hui; Zhang, Wen-Jie; Dai, Yong",World journal of gastroenterology,216,1

OBJECTIVE This systematic review and meta-analysis provides the scientific summary of initial Fio2 in term and late preterm newborns (≥35 weeks' gestation) who receive respiratory support at birth. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature were searched between January 1, 1980 and August 10, 2018. STUDY SELECTION Studies were selected by pairs of independent reviewers in 2 stages, with a Cohen's κ of 0.8 and 1.0. DATA EXTRACTION Pairs of independent reviewers extracted data, appraised risk of bias, and assessed Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation certainty of evidence. RESULTS Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 5 quasi RCTs included 2164 patients. Room air (Fio2 0.21) was associated with a statistically significant benefit in short-term mortality compared with 100% oxygen (Fio2 1.0) (7 RCTs; n = 1469; risk ratio [RR] = 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57 to 0.94). No significant differences were observed in neurodevelopmental impairment (2 RCTs; n = 360; RR = 1.41; 95% CI: 0.77 to 2.60) or hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (5 RCTs; n = 1315; RR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.68 to 1.18).

METHODS Four patients with prior keratoplasty developed presumed immunologic rejection after the mRNA-1273 vaccination for coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Case 1 had received Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty 6 months ago and presented with endothelial graft rejection 3 weeks after the first vaccine dose. Case 2 had undergone penetrating keratoplasty 3 years previously and presented with acute endothelial rejection 9 days after the second vaccine dose. Case 3 had prior Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) and began experiencing symptoms of endothelial graft rejection 2 weeks after the second vaccine dose. Case 4 presented with endothelial rejection of the penetrating keratoplasty graft 2 weeks after the second vaccine dose. RESULTS Frequent topical corticosteroids alone were initiated in all 4 cases. In case 1, the endothelial rejection line appeared fainter with improvement in visual acuity and corneal edema 5 weeks after diagnosis. Case 2 experienced complete resolution of corneal stromal edema and rejection line 6 weeks after diagnosis. Cases 3 and 4 have both experienced initial improvement with steroid treatment as well. CONCLUSIONS These cases suggest acute corneal endothelial rejection may occur soon after either dose of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Prompt initiation of aggressive topical steroid therapy may result in complete resolution of clinical signs and symptoms.

The aim of this work was to propose a novel methodology to analyze RCTs based on the assumption that centers with high placebo response are less informative than the other centers for estimating the 'true' treatment effect (TE). A linear mixed-effect modeling approach for repeated measures (MMRM) was used as a reference approach. The new method for estimating TE was based on a nonlinear longitudinal modeling of clinical scores (NLMMRM). NLMMRM estimates TE by associating a weighting factor to the data collected in each center. The weight was defined by the posterior probability of detecting a clinically relevant difference between active treatment and placebo at that center. Data from five RCTs in depression were used to compare the performance of MMRM with NLMMRM. The results of the analyses showed an average improvement of ~15% in the TE estimated with NLMMRM when the center effect was included in the analyses. Opposite results were observed with MMRM: TE estimate was reduced by ~4% when the center effect was considered as covariate in the analysis. The novel NLMMRM approach provides a tool for controlling the confounding effect of high placebo response, to increase signal detection and to provide a more reliable estimate of the 'true' TE by controlling false negative results associated with excessively high placebo response.","Gomeni, Roberto; Goyal, Navin; Bressolle, Françoise; Fava, Maurizio",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,216,1

Thinning of adventitia and dilatation may occur following arterial dissection, thus resulting in a fusiform pseudoaneurysm, which can subsequently cause bleeding, expanding, or pulsatile hematoma. Currently, medical management with anticoagulation remains the first line of treatment and yields good outcomes in 75% of cases with a mortality rate of 3-4%. Endovascular intervention is indicated with failure of medical therapy, progressive enlargement of a traumatic pseudoaneurysm, acute flow-related infarcts due to vessel occlusion, or when anticoagulation is contraindicated due to risk of pseudoaneurysm rupture and hemorrhage. Recognized interventional treatments include parent artery occlusion with or without revascularization, endovascular coil embolization, and covered stenting. Summary A wide variety of endovascular stents are available that are capable of opening a stenosed vessel while obliterating the associated false lumen and providing a scaffold for embolization of the pseudoaneurysm. The use of the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) in the management of traumatic intracranial pseudoaneurysms has been described. However, there are few reports on the usage of the PED for treating traumatic extracranial ICA dissection and/or pseudoaneurysms. However, a potential complication of the use of PED in the extracranial ICA is a hypothetical tendency to migrate in a mobile vessel. Thus, the risk of migration of the PED has encouraged practitioners to adopt strategies to limit this risk. Key Messages We describe different techniques employed to anchor the flow-diverting construct within tortuous, mobile vessels.","Amuluru, Krishna; Al-Mufti, Fawaz; Roth, William; Prestigiacomo, Charles J; Gandhi, Chirag D",Interventional neurology,216,1

METHODS We studied 618 161 people with T2D followed between March and December 2020 from 1744 UK general practices registered with the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We focused on six health checks: haemoglobin A1c, serum creatinine, cholesterol, urinary albumin excretion, blood pressure and body mass index assessment. Regression models compared observed rates in April 2020 and between March and December 2020 with trend-adjusted expected rates derived from 10-year historical data. RESULTS In April 2020, in English practices, rates of performing health checks were reduced by 76%-88% when compared with 10-year historical trends, with older people from deprived areas experiencing the greatest reductions. Between May and December 2020, the reduced rates recovered gradually but overall remained 28%-47% lower, with similar findings in other UK nations. Extrapolated to the UK population, there were ~7.4 million fewer care processes undertaken March-December 2020. In England, rates for new medication fell during April with reductions varying from 10% (95% CI: 4% to 16%) for antiplatelet agents to 60% (95% CI: 58% to 62%) for antidiabetic medications. Overall, between March and December 2020, the rate of prescribing new diabetes medications fell by 19% (95% CI: 15% to 22%) and new antihypertensive medication prescribing fell by 22% (95% CI: 18% to 26%), but prescribing of new lipid-lowering or antiplatelet therapy was unchanged. Similar trends were observed across the UK, except for a reduction in new lipid-lowering therapy prescribing in the other UK nations (reduction: 16% (95% CI: 10% to 21%)). Extrapolated to the UK population, between March and December 2020, there were ~31 800 fewer people with T2D prescribed a new type of diabetes medication and ~14 600 fewer prescribed a new type of antihypertensive medication. CONCLUSIONS Over the coming months, healthcare services will need to manage this backlog of testing and prescribing. We recommend effective communications to ensure patient engagement with diabetes services, monitoring and opportunities for prescribing, and when appropriate use of home monitoring, remote consultations and other innovations in care.","Carr, Matthew J; Wright, Alison K; Leelarathna, Lalantha; Thabit, Hood; Milne, Nicola; Kanumilli, Naresh; Ashcroft, Darren M; Rutter, Martin K",BMJ quality & safety,216,22

Many of these events are asymptomatic and identified only on diffusion-weighted imaging. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to study the incidence of DWI positive for thromboembolic events following endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS A comprehensive literature search identified studies published between 2000 and April 2016 that reported postprocedural DWI findings in patients undergoing endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. The primary outcome was the incidence of DWI positive for thromboembolic events. We examined outcomes by treatment type, sex, and aneurysm characteristics. Meta-analyses were performed by using a random-effects model. RESULTS Twenty-two studies with 2148 patients and 2268 aneurysms were included. The overall incidence of DWI positive for thromboembolic events following endovascular treatment was 49% (95% CI, 42%-56%). Treatment with flow diversion trended toward a higher rate of DWI positive for lesions than coiling alone (67%; 95% CI, 46%-85%; versus 45%; 95% CI, 33%-56%; P = .07). There was no difference between patients treated with coiling alone and those treated with balloon-assisted (44%; 95% CI, 29%-60%; P = .99) or stent-assisted (43%; 95% CI, 24%-63%; P = .89) coiling. Sex, aneurysm rupture status, location, and size were not associated with the rate of DWI positive for lesions. CONCLUSIONS One in 2 patients may have infarcts on DWI following endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. There is a trend toward a higher incidence of DWI-positive lesions following treatment with flow diversion compared with coiling. Patient demographics and aneurysm characteristics were not associated with DWI-positive thromboembolic events.","Bond, K M; Brinjikji, W; Murad, M H; Kallmes, D F; Cloft, H J; Lanzino, G",AJNR.

Both the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores had adequate discrimination across relevant timeframes and adequate distribution across relevant mortality thresholds. Additionally, we found that the only published state prioritization schema that includes pediatric and adult patients had poor alignment of mortality risks, giving adults a systematic advantage over children. CONCLUSIONS In the largest analysis of organ dysfunction scores in a general population of critically ill adults and children to date, we found that both the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores had adequate performance across relevant mortality thresholds and timeframes for resource allocation. Published prioritization schemas that include both pediatric and adult patients may put children at a disadvantage. Furthermore, the distribution of patient and mortality risk in the published schemas may not adequately stratify patients for some high-stakes allocation decisions. This information may be useful to bioethicists, healthcare leaders, and policy makers who are developing resource allocation policies for critically ill patients.","Sanchez-Pinto, L Nelson; Parker, William F; Mayampurath, Anoop; Derrington, Sabrina; Michelson, Kelly N",Critical care medicine,216,1

A lot of technical changes would compromise clinical outcomes after procedure, including a variable prostate vascular anatomy, thin PA, and extensive atherosclerotic disease. The purpose of our study is to exploit the advantages of Perfusion Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) that could impact treatment and help interventional radiologists for treatment planning, diagnosis and for assessing the technical feasibility during PAE, mitigating the risk of nontarget embolization and suggesting clinical outcomes.

Additionally, some studies require the analysis of pro-allergic and inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, LTC4, and various basophil-derived cytokines (e.g., IL-4 and IL-13). Elucidation of intracellular signaling proteins by Western blotting, cytosolic free calcium concentration by spectrofluorophotometry, and detection of mediator releases, as well as analysis of gene expressions by RT-PCR, generally require relatively large numbers of purified basophils. In selected assays, flow cytometry can enable the analysis of relatively low cell numbers and purity for the expression of intracellular signaling proteins or measurement of cytosolic free calcium concentrations by basophil-specific gating strategies. Unfortunately, many aspects of signal transduction relevant to human basophils cannot be readily extrapolated from the use of basophil or mast cell lines. This chapter therefore focuses on how to employ primary human basophils for studying mediator releases and signaling characteristics.","Knol, Edward F; Gibbs, Bernhard F",Methods in molecular biology,216,17

A 58-year-old woman underwent surgery for scoliosis and underwent posterior pedicle screw fixation. In the first postoperative (PO)day, she developed mild dyspnea. An anteroposterior chest radiograph revealed bilateral pleural effusion, which was more pronounced on the left side. A thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, performed in the second PO day, revealed a solid mass in the pleural cavity that was associated with screw displacement, which had also entered into the peritoneal cavity without apparent other lesion of hollow and solid viscous. In the third PO day, after the screw was removed, explorative laparoscopy was carried out. We observed herniation of the omentum through a small diaphragmatic tear. Once the absence of visceral injury was confirmed, we reduced the omentum into the abdomen. Then, we repaired the hernia by applying a dual layer polypropylene mesh over the defect with a 3-cm overlap. The remainder of the postoperative period was uneventful. Iatrogenic DH due to a pedicle screw displacement has never been described before. In cases of pleural effusion following spinal surgery, rapid assessment and treatment are crucial. We conclude that a laparoscopic approach to iatrogenic DH could be feasible and effective in a hemodynamically stable patient with negative CT findings because it enables the completion of the diagnostic cascade and the repair of the tear, providing excellent visualization of the abdominal viscera and diaphragmatic tears.","Bini, Roberto; Fontana, Diego; Longo, Alessandro; Manconi, Paolo; Leli, Renzo",World journal of emergency surgery : WJES,216,1

Physicians are expected to provide return-to-diving recommendations after SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection based upon the best available evidence, often drawn from experience with other, similar diseases. Scuba diving presents unique physiologic challenges to the body secondary to immersion, increased pressure and increased work of breathing.

Modification of TiZr surface by anodization is reported to have the potential to modulate the osteoblast cell behaviour favouring more rapid bone formation. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of anodizing the surface of TiZr discs with respect to osseointegration after four weeks implantation in sheep femurs. Titanium (Ti) and TiZr discs were anodized in an electrolyte containing DL-α-glycerophosphate and calcium acetate at 300 V. The surface characteristics were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, electron dispersive spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and goniometry. Forty implant discs with thickness of 1.5 and 10 mm diameter (10 of each-titanium, titanium-zirconium, anodized titanium and anodized titanium-zirconium) were placed in the femoral condyles of 10 sheep. Histomorphometric and histologic analysis were performed 4 weeks after implantation. The anodized implants displayed hydrophilic, porous, nano-to-micrometer scale roughened surfaces. Energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis revealed calcium and phosphorous incorporation into the surface of both titanium and titanium-zirconium after anodization. Histologically there was new bone apposition on all implanted discs, slightly more pronounced on anodised discs. The percentage bone-to-implant contact measurements of anodized implants were higher than machined/unmodified implants but there was no significant difference between the two groups with anodized surfaces (P > 0.05, n = 10). The present histomorphometric and histological findings confirm that surface modification of titanium-zirconium by anodization is similar to anodised titanium enhances early osseointegration compared to machined implant surfaces.","Sharma, Ajay; McQuillan, A James; Shibata, Yo; Sharma, Lavanya A; Waddell, John Neil; Duncan, Warwick John",Journal of materials science.

METHODS Patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy were randomly assigned to an ultrasonic ESD group (n = 20) or monopolar ESD group (n = 20). Colpotomy was performed using the assigned ESD. The degree of surgical smoke or vapor obstructing the laparoscopic view was assessed by two independent reviewers using a 5-point Likert scale, in which a higher score indicates worse visibility. The degree of the lateral thermal damage was measured as the width from the point of instrument application to the margins of the unchanged nearby tissue using a light microscope. RESULTS The baseline characteristics did not statistically differ between the two groups. The degree of surgical smoke or vapor obstructing vision was 1.2 ± 0.8 points in the ultrasonic group and 3.9 ± 0.7 points in the monopolar groups (p < 0.001). The lateral thermal damage was significantly increased in the monopolar group compared to in the ultrasound group (1500 µm [1200-2500 µm] vs. 950 µm [650-1725 µm], p = 0.037).

To start gaining information about bat-transmitted viruses in Hungary, we tested multiple bat species for several virus groups between 2012 and 2013. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fecal samples were collected from bats across Hungary. We performed group-specific RT-PCR screening for astro-, calici-, corona-, lyssa-, othoreo-, paramyxo-, and rotaviruses. Positive samples were selected and sequenced for further phylogenetic analyses. RESULTS A total of 447 fecal samples, representing 24 European bat species were tested. Novel strains of astroviruses, coronaviruses, and caliciviruses were detected and analyzed phylogenetically. Out of the 447 tested samples, 40 (9%) bats were positive for at least one virus. Bat-transmitted astroviruses (BtAstV) were detected in eight species with a 6.93% detection rate (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.854, 9.571). Coronaviruses (BtCoV) were detected in seven bat species with a detection rate of 1.79% (95% CI 0.849, 3.348), whereas novel caliciviruses (BtCalV) were detected in three bat species with a detection rate of 0.67% (95% CI 0.189, 1.780). Phylogenetic analyses revealed a great diversity among astrovirus strains, whereas the Hungarian BtCoV strains clustered together with both alpha- and betacoronavirus strains from other European countries. One of the most intriguing findings of our investigation is the discovery of novel BtCalVs in Europe. The Hungarian BtCalV did not cluster with any of the calcivirus genera identified in the family so far. CONCLUSIONS We have successfully confirmed BtCoVs in numerous bat species. Furthermore, we have described new bat species harboring BtAstVs in Europe and found new species of CalVs.

The discovery of its homologue, ACE2, 20 years ago has led to intensive comparisons of these two enzymes revealing surprising structural, catalytic and functional distinctions between them. ACE2 plays multiple roles not only as a vasopeptidase but also as a regulator of amino acid transport and serendipitously as a viral receptor, mediating the cellular entry of the coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and, very recently, COVID-19. Catalytically, ACE2 functions as a monocarboxypeptidase principally converting the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II to the vasodilatory peptide Ang-(1-7) thereby counterbalancing the action of ACE on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and providing a cardioprotective role. Unlike ACE, ACE2 does not metabolise bradykinin nor is it inhibited by classical ACE inhibitors. However, it does convert a number of other regulatory peptides in vitro and in vivo. Interest in ACE2 biology and its potential as a possible therapeutic target has surged in recent months as the COVID-19 pandemic rages worldwide.

Despite the reduction of primary emissions during the lockdown period, heavy haze pollution was observed unexpectedly in megacities in North and East China. In this study, we conducted online measurements of organic aerosol in a background site before and during the lockdown in Guanzhong basin, Northwest China. The oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA) increased from 24% of total OA (3.2 ± 1.6 μg m-3) before lockdown to 54% of total OA (4.5 ± 1.3 μg m-3) during lockdown, likely due to substantial decrease of NOx emissions during lockdown which resulted in large increase of O3 and thus atmospheric oxidizing capacity. OOA showed higher mass concentrations and fractional contributions during lockdown than before lockdown, and increased with the increase of Ox in both periods. In comparison, aqueous secondary organic aerosol (aqSOA) showed high mass concentrations and fractional contributions in both polluted periods before and during lockdown with the increase of aerosol liquid water content (ALWC). The increase of aqSOA under high ALWC conditions is very likely the reason of pollution events during lockdown. Combined with trajectory analysis, the absence of Guanzhong cluster in polluted period during lockdown may play a key role in the OA variations between two polluted periods. In addition, when comparing the clusters from the same transmission directions between before lockdown and during lockdown, the OA fractions showed similar variations during lockdown in all clusters, suggesting the OA variations are widespread in northwest China.","Zhong, Haobin; Huang, Ru-Jin; Chang, Yunhua; Duan, Jing; Lin, Chunshui; Chen, Yang",The Science of the total environment,216,26

There are 16 nonstructural viral proteins beside their precursors (1a and 1ab polyproteins). The nonstructural proteins are named as nsp1 to nsp16 and they act as enzymes, coenzymes, and binding proteins to facilitate the replication, transcription, and translation of the virus. The structural proteins are bound to the RNA in the nucleocapsid (N- protein) or to the lipid bilayer membrane of the viral envelope. The lipid bilayer proteins include the membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E), and spike protein (S). Beside their role as structural proteins, they are essential for the host cells binding and invasion. The SARS-CoV-2 contains six accessory proteins which participates in the viral replication, assembly and virus- host interactions. The SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins are orf3a, orf6, orf7a, orf7b, orf8, and orf10. The functions of the SARS-CoV-2 are not well known, while the functions of their corresponding proteins in SARS-CoV are either well known or poorly studied.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the health authorities of the United Kingdom approved and started vaccination using the Pfizer and BioNTech mRNA vaccine. Also, The FDA of USA approved the treatment of COVID-19 using two monoclonal antibodies produced by Regeneron pharmaceuticals to target the spike protein. The SARS-CoV-2 proteins can be used for the diagnosis, as drug targets and in vaccination trials for COVID-19.

RESULTS The pathological changes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the different organs, the correlations between the single cell types targeted by the virus in the different human organs and the clinical consequences, COVID-19 chronic pathologies in liver fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis and atrial arrhythmias, glomerulosclerosis and pulmonary fibrosis, due to the systemic fibroblast activation induced by angiotensin II are discussed. CONCLUSIONS The main pathways involved showed different pathological changes in multiple tissues and the different clinical presentations. Even if ACE2 is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and the main entry point into cells for the virus, ACE2 expression does not always explain the observed marked inter-individual variability in clinical presentation and outcome, evidencing the complexity of this disorder. The proper interpretation of the growing data available might allow to better classifying COVID-19 in human pathology.","Saba, L; Gerosa, C; Fanni, D; Marongiu, F; La Nasa, G; Caocci, G; Barcellona, D; Balestrieri, A; Coghe, F; Orru, G; Coni, P; Piras, M; Ledda, F; Suri, J S; Ronchi, A; D'Andrea, F; Cau, R; Castagnola, M; Faa, G",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,216,1

METHODS Data were from a large US healthcare registry (Consortium of Rheumatology Researchers of North America Rheumatoid Arthritis Registry). The analysis included patients (aged ≥18 years) with a documented diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a valid baseline Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of >2.8 and no prior bDMARD or tsDMARD use. Outcomes were captured at 1-year postinitiation of a TNFi (adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab pegol, golimumab or infliximab) or a non-TNFi (abatacept, tocilizumab, rituximab, anakinra or tofacitinib) and included CDAI, 28-Joint Modified Disease Activity Score, patient-reported outcomes (including the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index, EuroQol-5 Dimension score, sleep, anxiety, morning stiffness and fatigue) and rates of anaemia. Groups were propensity score-matched at baseline to account for potential confounding. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences observed between the TNFi and non-TNFi treatment groups for outcomes assessed, except the incidence rate ratio for anaemia, which slightly favoured the TNFi group (19.04 per 100 person-years) versus the non-TNFi group (24.01 per 100 person-years, p=0.03). No potential effect modifiers were found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS The findings of no significant differences in outcomes between first-line TNF versus first-line non-TNF groups support RA guidelines, which recommend individualised care based on clinical judgement and consideration of patient preferences.","Pappas, Dimitrios A; St John, Gregory; Etzel, Carol J; Fiore, Stefano; Blachley, Taylor; Kimura, Toshio; Punekar, Rajeshwari; Emeanuru, Kelechi; Choi, Jeannie; Boklage, Susan; Kremer, Joel M",Annals of the rheumatic diseases,216,17

METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted among 15,276 schoolteachers using an online questionnaire. The variables included sociodemographic and occupational data, health situation, habits and behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Bivariate analyses using Pearson's chi-square test and multiple analyses using Poisson regression were performed to identify the associated factors. RESULTS About 58% of schoolteachers reported back pain due to changes in routine activities during the pandemic. The adjusted model showed a correlation between back pain and female sex, longer working hours, overwork, difficulties concerning distance working, negative changes in health status and quality of sleep; frequent feeling of sadness, depression, or anxiety; use of medications to relax, sleep or against stress/anxiety/depression; physical inactivity or negative changes in the practice of physical activities; increased body weight; reduction of leisure time; increased time of use of computer or tablet and overload of housework. CONCLUSION During the COVID-19 pandemic, schoolteachers reported a high prevalence of emergence of back pain, which delineates a contradiction in terms: on the one hand, distance education allows social distancing that contributes to the preservation of teachers' health by reducing the risk of contamination by COVID-19. On the other hand, it imposes new demands that-in disagreement with working conditions-can threaten the health of these workers.","Barbosa, Rose Elizabeth Cabral; Fonseca, Giovanni Campos; Souza E Silva, Nayra Suze; Silva, Rosângela Ramos Veloso; Assunção, Ada Ávila; Haikal, Desirée Sant'Ana",International archives of occupational and environmental health,216,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS From September 2010 to May 2011 we performed single-port extraperitoneal laparoscopic Burch colposuspension for stress incontinence in 15 patients. Fifteen women who were diagnosed with urodynamic stress incontinence were included in the study. Demographic and clinical data, intraoperative findings, and postoperative course were recorded. RESULTS The mean age was 45,80 ± 9,91 years (range: 38-70 years). The mean body mass index was 25,67 ± 4.06 kg/m2 (range: 22.23-35.38 kg/m(2)). The mean operation time and mean blood loss were 40.80 ± 5.94 minutes (range: 30-50 minutes) and 30.67 ± 11.00 cc (range: 10-50 cc), respectively. The single-port laparoscopic operations were technically completed successfully without placement of additional trocars and there were no complications. The cure and improvement rates following laparoscopic Burch colposuspension via single port were 73.3 % and 20 % respectively. CONCLUSION Single-port laparoscopic Burch can be an alternative treatment for scarless surgery in stress incontinence. Single-incision laparoscopic Burch colposuspension can offer suitable, effective and safe treatment in women with stress incontinence.","Gumus, Ilknur Inegol; Surgit, Onder; Kaygusuz, Ikbal",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,216,1

Yet, little is known about the clinical and biologic correlates of circulating ACE2 levels in humans. We assessed the clinical and proteomic correlates of plasma (soluble) ACE2 protein levels in human heart failure. We measured plasma ACE2 using a modified aptamer assay among PHFS (Penn Heart Failure Study) participants (n=2248). We performed an association study of ACE2 against ≈5000 other plasma proteins measured with the SomaScan platform. Plasma ACE2 was not associated with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin-receptor blocker use. Plasma ACE2 was associated with older age, male sex, diabetes mellitus, a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, worse New York Heart Association class, a history of coronary artery bypass surgery, and higher pro-BNP (pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) levels. Plasma ACE2 exhibited associations with 1011 other plasma proteins. In pathway overrepresentation analyses, top canonical pathways associated with plasma ACE2 included clathrin-mediated endocytosis signaling, actin cytoskeleton signaling, mechanisms of viral exit from host cells, EIF2 (eukaryotic initiation factor 2) signaling, and the protein ubiquitination pathway. In conclusion, in humans with heart failure, plasma ACE2 is associated with various clinical factors known to be associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including older age, male sex, and diabetes mellitus, but is not associated with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin-receptor blocker use. Plasma ACE2 protein levels are prominently associated with multiple cellular pathways involved in cellular endocytosis, exocytosis, and intracellular protein trafficking. Whether these have a causal relationship with ACE2 or are relevant to novel coronavirus-2 infection remains to be assessed in future studies.","Chirinos, Julio A; Cohen, Jordana B; Zhao, Lei; Hanff, Thomas; Sweitzer, Nancy; Fang, James; Corrales-Medina, Vicente; Anmar, Ron; Morley, Michael; Zamani, Payman; Bhattacharya, Priyanka; Brandimarto, Jeff; Jia, Yi; Basso, Michael D; Wang, Zhaoqing; Ebert, Christina; Ramirez-Valle, Francisco; Schafer, Peter H; Seiffert, Dietmar; Gordon, David A; Cappola, Thomas",Hypertension,216,7

Thromboprophylactic anticoagulation is commonly used to prevent VTE at the risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). We extracted all patients who underwent craniotomy for a primary malignant brain tumor from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) registry (2005-2015) to perform a time-to-event analysis and identify relevant predictors of DVT, PE, and ICH within 30 days after surgery. Among the 7376 identified patients, the complication rates were 2.6, 1.5, and 1.3% for DVT, PE, and ICH, respectively. VTE was the second-most common major complication and third-most common reason for readmission. ICH was the most common reason for reoperation. The increased risk of VTE extends beyond the period of hospitalization, especially for PE, whereas ICH occurred predominantly within the first days after surgery. Older age and higher BMI were overall predictors of VTE. Dependent functional status and longer operative times were predictive for VTE during hospitalization, but not for post-discharge events. Admission two or more days before surgery was predictive for DVT, but not for PE. Preoperative steroid usage and male gender were predictive for post-discharge DVT and PE, respectively. ICH was associated with various comorbidities and longer operative times. This multicenter study demonstrates distinct critical time periods for the development of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events after craniotomy. Furthermore, the VTE risk profile depends on the type of VTE (DVT vs. PE) and clinical setting (hospitalized vs. post-discharge patients).","Senders, Joeky T; Goldhaber, Nicole H; Cote, David J; Muskens, Ivo S; Dawood, Hassan Y; De Vos, Filip Y F L; Gormley, William B; Smith, Timothy R; Broekman, Marike L D",Journal of neuro-oncology,216,19

The aim of this study is to determine the midterm results and the safety of laparoscopic resizing of the gastric pouch after RYGB in cases where gastric pouch is > 200 ml and/or GJ anastomosis > 20 mm. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients who underwent gastric pouch resizing between January 2009 and December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed from a prospective database. The gastric pouch was resized to a volume of 30-40 ml. RESULTS A total of 48 patients had gastric pouch resizing after RYGB. The mean initial BMI was 42.9 ± 4.8 kg/m2. Perioperative morbidity was 8.3% in this series. Mean follow-up was 5.4 years. The mean BMI was 30.0 ± 7.3 kg/m2 at 1 year, 30.0 ± 6.0 kg/m2 at 3 years, and 30.9 ± 5.7 kg/m2 at 5 years. Mean %EBMIL at 1-, 3-, and 5-year follow-up was 51.9%, 55.1%, and 39%, respectively, in 48% follow-up rate. The obesity-related comorbidities disappeared in 67.3% of cases at maximum follow-up.

We have previously generated a transgenic mouse model that allows diphtheria toxin (DT)-induced ablation of Six2-positive nephron progenitor cells (NPCs). Elimination of existing native host NPCs enables their replacement with donor NPCs, which can generate neo-nephrons. However, this system cannot be applied to human NPCs, because DT induces apoptosis in human cells. Therefore, the present study presents a transgenic mouse model for the ablation of NPCs using tamoxifen, which does not affect human cells. Using this system, we successfully regenerate interspecies neo-nephrons, which exhibit urine-producing abilities, from transplanted rat NPCs in a mouse host. Transplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NPCs results in differentiation into renal vesicles, which connect to the ureteric bud of the host. Thus, we demonstrate the possibility of the regeneration of human kidneys derived from human iPSC-derived NPCs via NPC replacement.","Fujimoto, Toshinari; Yamanaka, Shuichiro; Tajiri, Susumu; Takamura, Tsuyoshi; Saito, Yatsumu; Matsumoto, Naoto; Matsumoto, Kei; Tachibana, Toshiaki; Okano, Hirotaka James; Yokoo, Takashi",Cell reports,216,2

METHODS In 2003, we modified our technique for LGT to include laparoscopically placed sutures to secure the stomach to the abdominal wall. A retrospective review was performed on all children undergoing LGT placement and PEGs from March 2003 to October 2009. In addition, a review of the literature was performed to identify the published rates of complications for these procedures. RESULTS During this time period, we have performed 85 LGT using this modified technique. In that same period, there have been 34 PEGs placed. The modification in our technique was instituted after a patient required reoperation for dislodgement in a laparoscopic U-stitch gastrostomy. To date, in the modified LGT group, there have been no disruptions of the gastrostomy tract in either the early or late periods, <90 days or >90 days, respectively. There have been 5 (5.9%) early dislodgements of the gastrostomy tube. All of these were before postoperative day 14 (at postoperative days 1, 2, 6, and 12), and all were replaced with placement verified by contrast study. None required reoperation. In the PEG group, there was 1 (2.9%) early and 1 (2.9%) late dislodgements and tract disruption that required reoperation. The published rate of dislodgement requiring reoperation in the Georgeson series of LGTs is 2.6%. The published rate of reoperation for dislodgement in PEGs is 4%-6%. CONCLUSION This modification of the Georgeson technique has been successful in reducing the need for reoperation associated with gastrostomy replacement after dislodgement.","Villalona, Gustavo A; Mckee, Milissa A; Diefenbach, Karen A",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

In this study, a robot-assisted US-navigation platform has been developed for 3D US guidance and planning of conformal HIFU ablations. The platform was used to evaluate a conformal therapeutic strategy associated with an interstitial dual-mode USgHIFU catheter prototype (64 elements linear-array, measured central frequency f = 6.5 MHz), developed for the treatment of HepatoCellular Carcinoma (HCC). The platform included a 3D navigation environment communicating in real-time with an open research dual-mode US scanner/HIFU generator and a robotic arm, on which the USgHIFU catheter was mounted. 3D US-navigation was evaluated in vitro for guiding and planning conformal HIFU ablations using a tumor-mimic model in porcine liver. Tumor-mimic volumes were then used as targets for evaluating conformal HIFU treatment planning in simulation. Height tumor-mimics (ovoid- or disc-shaped, sizes: 3-29 cm3) were created and visualized in liver using interstitial 2D US imaging. Robot-assisted spatial manipulation of these images and real-time 3D navigation allowed reconstructions of 3D B-mode US images for accurate tumor-mimic volume estimation (relative error: 4 ± 5%). Sectorial and full-revolution HIFU scanning (angular sectors: 88-360°) could both result in conformal ablations of the tumor volumes, as soon as their radii remained ≤ 24 mm. The presented US navigation-guided HIFU procedure demonstrated advantages for developing conformal interstitial therapies in standard operative rooms. Moreover, the modularity of the developed platform makes it potentially useful for developing other HIFU approaches.","Daunizeau, L; Nguyen, A; Le Garrec, M; Chapelon, J Y; N'Djin, W A",Computers in biology and medicine,216,1

OBJECTIVE This study was performed to test our hypothesis that intentional partial coiling of complex ruptured cerebral aneurysms, which are unfavorable for clipping and cannot be completely coiled primarily, prevents acute rebleeding to allow for clinical and neurological recovery until definitive treatment and produces favorable clinical outcomes. METHODS Data were collected from the prospective databases of three centers. Only subarachnoid hemorrhage patients that were treated with a strategy of intentional partial coiling for dome protection were included. This did not include patients in whom the goal was complete coiling but only subtotal coil occlusion was achieved. RESULTS Fifteen patients [aged 51 ± 13 years; HH 3-5 (n = 7); Fisher 3-4 (n = 9)] were treated with intentional partial dome protection. Aneurysm size was 12.8 ± 5.4 mm; neck size 4.9 ± 3 mm; 12 anterior circulation. Four intentional partial coilings were performed with balloon assistance. Definitive treatment was performed 92 ± 90 days later, with no case of rebleeding. Definitive treatment was clipping (n = 8), stent-coiling (n = 5), Onyx (n = 1), further coiling (n = 1). Clinical outcome was favorable in 13 cases (GOS 4-5), fair in one (GOS 3), and death in one (GOS 1). CONCLUSIONS Judicious use of a treatment strategy of intentional partial dome protection for complex aneurysms that are not favorable for clipping and in which complete coiling primarily is not possible may prevent acute rebleeding and produce favorable clinical outcomes.","Waldau, Ben; Reavey-Cantwell, John F; Lawson, Matthew F; Jahshan, Shady; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Mocco, J; Hoh, Brian L",Acta neurochirurgica,216,1

Fever and cough were the most common symptoms of both diseases, while myalgia and diarrhea were less common in patients with COVID-19. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was the most severe pulmonary complication that caused high mortality rate. Histologically, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was the most characteristic finding in non-survivors with either SARS or COVID-19. Cases of patients died less than 10~14 days of disease duration demonstrated acute-phase DAD, while cases beyond 10~14 days of disease duration exhibited organizing-phase DAD in SARS. Meanwhile, organization and fibrosis were usually accompanied by exudation. Coronavirus was mostly detected in pneumocytes, while less in macrophages and bronchiolar epithelial cells. Hemorrhagic necrosis and lymphocytes depletion were found in lymph nodes and spleen in both SARS and COVID-19, indicating a pathological basis of lymphocytopenia. Thrombosis was commonly observed in small vessels and microvascular in lungs accompanying DAD. Microthrombosis was also found in extrapulmonary organs in COVID-19, that was less reported in SARS. Damages in multiple extrapulmonary organs were observed, but coronavirus was not detected in some of those organs, might indicating an alternative mechanism beyond viral infection, such as hypoxemia, ischemia and cytokine storm induced immunological injury. Diffuse alveolar damage due to viral infection and immunological injury, as well as multi-organ dysfunction and extensive microthrombus formation, brought huge challenge to the management of patients with severe SARS or COVID-19.","Zhang, T; Sun, L X; Feng, R E",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,216,1

RESULTS There were 7,812 patients with TIA/stroke, of which 4,853 (62%) were candidates for EMS transport. Among them, 176 (3.6%) were not directly transported to hospital by ambulance. In 45% of them, delay from symptom onset to calling for EMS was ≤ 24 hours. On EMS arrival, common symptom was dizziness (28%), followed by weakness in arm or leg (21%), loss of sensibility (13%), speech disturbances (7%) and facial numbness (4%). The modified National Institute of Health Stroke Score (mNIHSS) was 0 in 80% and > 1 in two per cent. The NIHSS at the emergency department was 1-4 in 39% and 5-15 in six per cent. The EMS clinician made the decision not to transport the patient to hospital by the EMS in 84%, the dispatcher in 12% and the patient or relatives in four per cent. Patients were involved in the decision in 51%. Final diagnosis was stroke in 74% and the proportion who were independent in normal daily activities at hospital discharge decreased by 15% compared with before event. CONCLUSION About 3-4% of patients with TIA/stroke were not directly transported to hospital by EMS after prehospital assessment. The most common symptom was dizziness. Decision-support tools for EMS to identify time-sensitive conditions are required.","Magnusson, C; Lövgren, E; Alfredsson, J; Axelsson, C; Andersson Hagiwara, M; Rosengren, L; Herlitz, J; Jood, K",Acta neurologica Scandinavica,216,1

Methods A voluntary anonymous questionnaire was given to the 2018 American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS) annual meeting attendees. Comparisons were made by age, gender, experience (years), practice setting, and U.S. region. Results There were 59 responses from 671 physician conference attendees. Most were male (64.4%), U.S. physicians (94.6%), completed Obstetrics and Gynecology residencies (91.5%), practicing in University settings (66.1%). The mean age was 47.4±8.6 years, practicing>15 years (47.5%). Predominant routes were 53.8% robotic, 42.2% laparoscopic, and 4.0% open. Surgeons used 3-4 ports (both 50.0%), with 0-degree (46.0%) or 0 and 30 degree laparoscopes (36%). For sacral mesh attachment, 83.1% used suture as opposed to tacking devices, most often Gortex (56.3%). Anterior (48.1%) and posterior (50.0%) vaginal attachment used 5-6 sutures. Concomitant procedures included anterior repair (83.4% ""not usually""/""not at all""), posterior repair/perineorrhaphy (77.8% ""yes, often""/""yes, sometimes""), midurethral sling (42.6% ""yes, often""/51.9% ""yes, sometimes""), and hysteropexy (86.5% ""not usually""/""not at all""). Post void residual (PVR) was assessed after surgery by 89.8%, 75.5% via retrograde fill voiding trial. Most patients were discharged post-operative day 1 (POD1) (47.6% AM, 29.1% PM) or day of surgery (15.2%). Females more commonly performed hysteropexy (p=0.028) with no other significant differences by age, gender, experience, practice setting or region. Conclusion Most FPMRS surgeons perform MISC, equally robotic and laparoscopic. Concomitant posterior wall procedures and midurethral slings are common. Other than more hysteropexies performed by females, no other variables predicted technique variations, suggesting technique homogeneity.","Dubinskaya, Alexandra; Renkosiak, Kaitlin; Shepherd, Jonathan P",Cureus,216,31

PURPOSE. To synthesize qualitative literature to understand how stakeholders (including occupational therapists) experience and perceive IPS and consider the implications for future occupational therapy practice and research. METHOD. A scoping review methodology guided our review. We conducted an electronic search of qualitative and mixed-method studies on IPS. FINDINGS. Twenty-six articles were retrieved. Most studies sought clients' perspectives (n = 15), followed by practitioners (mostly employment specialists; n = 10) and only one with employers. IMPLICATIONS.

Six databases were searched (CENTRAL, Embase, LILACS, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science). Additionally, hand-searching and grey literature search were performed. The main outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity rates. Androgen deprivation therapy-free survival (ADT-FS), local control, pattern of recurrence, cancer-specific survival and overall survival were also assessed. Risk of bias and quality of evidence were judged with the aid of specific tools. Fourteen studies were included, involving 661 patients and 899 lesions (561 nodal, 336 bone, 2 liver). Median PFS and ADT-FS were around 1 to 3 years. Local control rates varied from 82 to 100% among researches with low risk of bias. Acute and late grade 2 toxicity was observed in 2.4% and 1.1% of the patients, respectively. One case of acute and two cases of late grade 3 toxicity were registered. Only one randomized study addresses this topic. Although it does not meet all the eligibility criteria, it is useful for the discussion. A quantitative analysis was not possible, nor were subgroup analyses, due to the significant heterogeneity of the interventions and outcomes reported. Longer follow-up period is required. SBRT seems to be a safe approach to metastatic lesions that might provide disease control and defer androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Local control is better when higher radiation doses are employed.","Vilela, Ricardo Alencar; Navarro, Natássia Ferreira; Faria, Edison Tostes; Ferreira, Elaine Barros; Ruzza, Rachel Zomer; Gadia, Rafael; Guerra, Eliete Neves Silva; Reis, Paula Elaine Diniz Dos",Journal of medical imaging and radiation oncology,216,4

Until that point there existed no evidence concerning the views of health professionals on decriminalisation or on their willingness to be involved in abortion care. The purpose of this study was to address this lack of evidence, including all categories of health professionals working in obstetrics and gynaecology units in Northern Ireland. METHODS The online survey was targeted at medical, nursing and midwifery staff working in the obstetrics and gynaecology units in each Health and Social Care (HSC) Trust in Northern Ireland. The survey was issued via clinical directors in each Trust using the REDCap platform. RESULTS The findings showed widespread support for decriminalisation of abortion up until 24 weeks' gestation (n=169, 54%). The majority of clinicians stated they were willing to provide abortions in certain circumstances (which were undefined) (n=188, 60% medical abortions; n=157, 50% surgical abortions). Despite regional variation, the results show that there are sufficient numbers of clinicians to provide a service within each HSC Trust. The results indicate that many clinicians who report a religious affiliation are also supportive of decriminalisation (n=46, 51% Catholic; n=53, 45% Protestant) and are willing to provide care, countering the assumption that those of faith would all raise conscientious objections to service provision. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study are very encouraging for the development, implementation and delivery of local abortion care within HSC Trusts in Northern Ireland and should be of value in informing commissioners and providers about the design of a service model and its underpinning training programmes.","Bloomer, Fiona; Kavanagh, Jayne; Morgan, Leanne; McLaughlin, Laura; Roberts, Ralph; Savage, Wendy; Francome, Colin",BMJ sexual & reproductive health,216,20

It affects more than 650 million adults worldwide and is associated with a range of health complications. Qualitative research plays a key role in understanding patient experiences and the factors that facilitate or hinder the effectiveness of health interventions. This review aims to systematically locate, assess and synthesise qualitative studies in order to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the lived experience of people with obesity. METHODS This is a protocol for a qualitative evidence synthesis of the lived experience of people with obesity. A defined search strategy will be employed in conducting a comprehensive literature search of the following databases: PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, PsycArticles and Dimensions (from 2011 onwards). Qualitative studies focusing on the lived experience of adults with obesity (BMI >30) will be included. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, abstracts and full-text articles and abstract data. The quality of included studies will be appraised using the critical appraisal skills programme (CASP) criteria. Thematic synthesis will be conducted on all of the included studies. Confidence in the review findings will be assessed using GRADE CERQual. DISCUSSION The findings from this synthesis will be used to inform the EU Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI)-funded SOPHIA (Stratification of Obesity Phenotypes to Optimize Future Obesity Therapy) study. The objective of SOPHIA is to optimise future obesity treatment and stimulate a new narrative, understanding and vocabulary around obesity as a set of complex and chronic diseases. The findings will also be useful to health care providers and policy makers who seek to understand the experience of those with obesity.

OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to evaluate prevalence of respiratory viruses in children hospitalized for acute wheezing along with demographic and clinical data. METHODS We enrolled 101 children, n=50 (49.5%) with wheezy bronchitis, n=34 (33.7%) with acute bronchiolitis and n=17 (16.8%) with exacerbation of asthma; (median age 1.41±2.84 years). Multiplex real-time PCR assay was used for virus detection. RESULTS One or more viruses were detected in 83.2% subjects: RSV in 44.6%, followed by RV (23.8%), hBOV and hMPV (both 11.9%); other viruses were less frequent (<8%). Viral coinfection was found in 38 (37.6%) of children. ANCOVA analysis revealed significantly higher total IgE concentrations in hMPV-positive subgroup compared to RSV (34 KU/l vs 12.7 KU/l; p=0.009) and RV (13.3 KU/l, p=0.022). For both hMPV and hBOV anassociation with atopic dermatitis (AD) was observed: aOR for hMPV and AD was 5.6 (95%CI: 1.4-22.7; p=0.016) and 4.7 for hBOV and AD (95%CI: 1.3-18; p=0.024). CONCLUSION Viral detection ratio in wheezy respiratory tract infections in Polish children ishigh (83.2%), with both hBOV and hMPV at 11.9% The results also suggest possible relationship of hBOV wheezy infection with nonspecific markers of atopy in children.","Sobkowiak, Paulina; Mikoś, Marcin; Bręborowicz, Anna; Szczepankiewicz, Aleksandra",The clinical respiratory journal,216,1

Even use of a fiberoptic bronchoscope (FB) after induction of anesthesia was not helpful to predict delayed compression of the airway. Therefore, the anesthesiologist and the cardiothoracic surgeon must prepare for unexpected delayed compression of the airway, even in low risk patients who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic without postural symptoms or radiographic evidence of significant compression of structures. We also describe successful management for the compressed carina and left main bronchus with a double lumen tube (DLT) as a stent during surgery.

CLINICAL FINDINGS The cat had intermittent mydriasis, hyperthermia, and facial twitching. Findings of MRI and CSF sample analysis were unremarkable, and results of infectious disease testing were negative. Treatment was initiated with phenobarbital, zonisamide, and levetiracetam; however, the presumed seizure activity continued. Results of analysis of continuous electroencephalographic recording indicated the cat had nonconvulsive status epilepticus. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME The cat was treated with phenobarbital IV (6 mg/kg [2.7 mg/lb] q 30 min during a 9-hour period; total dose, 108 mg/kg [49.1 mg/lb]); treatment was stopped when a burst-suppression electroencephalographic pattern was detected. During this high-dose phenobarbital treatment period, an endotracheal tube was placed and the cat was monitored and received fluids, hetastarch, and dopamine IV. Continuous mechanical ventilation was not required. After treatment, the cat developed unclassified cardiomyopathy, azotemia, anemia, and pneumonia. These problems resolved during a 9-month period.

There are no data in the US literature analyzing the impact of technique on anastomotic failure rates in EGS patients. The purpose of the current study was to compare outcomes of hand-sewn (HS) versus stapled (ST) bowel anastomoses in EGS patients. METHODS A retrospective chart review of all patients admitted by our EGS service undergoing bowel resection for emergent indications from January 2007 to July 2011 was performed. Time from surgery to diagnosis of anastomotic failure was recorded as were the diagnostic modality and treatment of each anastomotic failure. Specific data on damage-control techniques, if used, were also collected. RESULTS There were 100 HS (43%), and 133 ST (57%) anastomoses in 231 patients. Operative times were shorter in ST anastomosis technique (205 minutes for HS vs. 193 minutes for ST, p = 0.02). Anastomotic failures were identified in 26 patients (11%) and were significantly higher in the ST group than the HS group (15.0% vs. 6.1%, p = 0.003). A multivariate logistic regression analysis, controlling for age and preoperative nutritional status, revealed ST technique to be an independent risk factor for anastomotic failure (odds ratio, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-6.50; p = 0.034). CONCLUSION Anastomotic failures are more than twice as likely with ST than HS anastomoses in the EGS population. This is true even when controlling for markers of preoperative nutrition and demographics. These data suggest that the HS anastomosis should be the preferred method of reconstruction after bowel resection in EGS patients.","Farrah, Jason P; Lauer, Cynthia W; Bray, Mallory S; McCartt, Jason M; Chang, Michael C; Meredith, J Wayne; Miller, Preston R; Mowery, Nathan T",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,216,16

We have employed a technique for mediastinoscopic extended thymectomy (MET) on children with MG. METHOD A total of 14 children underwent MET at Kanagawa Children's Medical Center between 2005 and 2013. A mediastinal operation field was made by a V-shaped hook infrasternally to extirpate the thymus with adipose tissue around the thymus. RESULTS The operation time and the amount of blood loss were 182±44 minutes and 34±43 ml, respectively. Postoperative complications, in the form of transient paralysis of the right recurrent nerve, occurred in 2 patients. The median length of postoperative hospital stay was 4.5 days. After MET, 6 patients achieved complete remission and 7 patients achieved steroid dose reduction, but no improvement was seen in 1 patient.

Respiratory specimens were obtained from 21 students for the outbreak investigation. The TaqMan array card (TAC), a quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based multipathogen detection technology, was used to initially identify Mycoplasma pneumoniae as the causative agent in this outbreak. TAC demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity and sensitivity compared to those of the multiplex qPCR assay for this agent. All M. pneumoniae specimens (n=12) and isolates (n=10) were found through genetic analysis to be susceptible to macrolide antibiotics. The strain diversity of M. pneumoniae associated with this outbreak setting was identified using a variety of molecular typing procedures, resulting in two P1 genotypes (types 1 [60%] and 2 [40%]) and seven different multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) profiles. Continued molecular typing of this organism, particularly during outbreaks, may enhance the current understanding of the epidemiology of M. pneumoniae and may ultimately lead to a more effective public health response.","Waller, Jessica L; Diaz, Maureen H; Petrone, Brianna L; Benitez, Alvaro J; Wolff, Bernard J; Edison, Laura; Tobin-D'Angelo, Melissa; Moore, Ashley; Martyn, Audrey; Dishman, Hope; Drenzek, Cherie L; Turner, Kim; Hicks, Lauri A; Winchell, Jonas M",Journal of clinical microbiology,216,1

We therefore implemented a multiparameter mapping (MPM) protocol based on vendor's product sequences and demonstrate its repeatability and reproducibility for whole-brain coverage. Within ~20 min, four MPM metrics (magnetization transfer saturation [MT], proton density [PD], longitudinal [R1], and effective transverse [R2*] relaxation rates) were measured using an optimized 1 mm isotropic resolution protocol on six 3 T MRI scanners from two different vendors. The same five healthy participants underwent two scanning sessions, on the same scanner, at each site. MPM metrics were calculated using the hMRI-toolbox. To account for different MT pulses used by each vendor, we linearly scaled the MT values to harmonize them across vendors. To determine longitudinal repeatability and inter-site comparability, the intra-site (i.e., scan-rescan experiment) coefficient of variation (CoV), inter-site CoV, and bias across sites were estimated. For MT, R1, and PD, the intra- and inter-site CoV was between 4 and 10% across sites and scan time points for intracranial gray and white matter. A higher intra-site CoV (16%) was observed in R2* maps. The inter-site bias was below 5% for all parameters. In conclusion, the MPM protocol yielded reliable quantitative maps at high resolution with a short acquisition time. The high reproducibility of MPM metrics across sites and scan time points combined with its tissue microstructure sensitivity facilitates longitudinal multicenter imaging studies targeting microstructural changes, for example, as a quantitative MRI biomarker for interventional clinical trials.","Leutritz, Tobias; Seif, Maryam; Helms, Gunther; Samson, Rebecca S; Curt, Armin; Freund, Patrick; Weiskopf, Nikolaus",Human brain mapping,216,19

We investigated whether Vo2pk and systemic responses measured during field walking tests were similar to those measured during an incremental treadmill test (ITMT) in obese individuals with treated OSA. METHODS Individuals with treated OSA and a BMI > 30 kg/m2 were recruited. Participants completed an ITMT, two 6-min walk tests (6MWTs), and two incremental shuttle walk tests (ISWTs) on three separate days in a randomized order. Expired gas analysis was performed during all tests. RESULTS The study was completed by 16 patients (nine men) (mean [SD] age, 58 [12] y; BMI, 36.1 [7.6] kg/m2). There was no difference (P = .27) in Vo2pk assessed by the ITMT and the ISWT (2,266 [478] and 2,017 [561] mL/min, respectively). The Vo2pk measured by the 6MWT (1,778 [360] mL/min) was lower than that measured by the ITMT (P < .01). The limits of agreement for Vo2pk between the ISWT and the ITM were ± 730 mL/min. Cardiorespiratory responses during the ISWT and the ITMT reflected a graded response to a peak, whereas the 6MWT demonstrated a rapid rise to a plateau. CONCLUSIONS The ISWT can be used instead of an ITMT and in preference to the 6MWT to assess cardiorespiratory fitness for a cohort of obese people with treated OSA. However, the imprecision of the agreement in Vo2pk between the ITMT and ISWT means they cannot be used interchangeably in an individual.

Mutations in Tyr might result in non-functional Tyr protein and, consequently, loss of pigment production. This is a rare genetic condition, known as albinism, described for most animal species, and one of the most obvious and simple phenotypes to investigate in model organisms. Mutations in the orthologous human TYR gene are associated with oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1). Over the last thirty years, the mouse Tyr locus has been studied as a paradigm for how genes and expression domains are organized and regulated in mammalian genomes. This review summarizes the major findings and experimental strategies used, from the production of conventional transgenic mice to the latest CRISPR-Cas9 genome-edited animals. The main conclusion inferred from all of these studies, which extends beyond the analysis of the mouse Tyr locus, is the relevance of analyzing non-coding regulatory DNA elements in their natural chromosomal environment, and not only as randomly inserted transgenes. Further, the identification of evolutionary conserved regulatory sequences might highlight new vulnerable sites in the human TYR gene, whose mutations could also be associated with albinism.","Seruggia, Davide; Josa, Santiago; Fernández, Almudena; Montoliu, Lluis",Pigment cell & melanoma research,216,11

Many studies have shown that in comparison with open hernia repair, laparoscopic repair results in less pain and a shorter convalescence. However, postoperative pain remains a concern. One possible cause of postoperative pain in the early postoperative phase is strain or cough on removal of the endotracheal tube. Use of a supraglottic airway (SGA) device helps to avoid such complaints. We evaluated postoperative pain after TAPP repair using the SGA for general anesthesia. METHODS We evaluated the postoperative pain in 146 patients with inguinal hernia repaired by TAPP in our hospital between May 2013 and May 2016. A total of 144 adult patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II who underwent needlescopic TAPP surgery were randomly allocated to one of two groups of 72 patients: group A (SGA), in which the patient's airway was secured with an appropriately sized I-gel, and group B (endotracheal tube), in which the airway was secured under laryngoscopy. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the groups regarding patient background, postoperative hospital stay, and operation time, and TAPP was performed safely in all cases. In the analysis of postoperative pain, the mean Numerical Rating Scale score of peak pain in group A was significantly less than that of group B (2.10 ± 2.05 vs 2.90 ± 2.65; p = 0.043). In group A, the percentage of patients who had an NRS score of 0 was 51.4% 30 min after surgery, 62.5% after 6 h and 68.1% at POD1, and compared to group B, the NRS scores were significantly higher at POD1 (p = 0.003), and the level of postoperative pain in group A tended to decrease earlier than that in group B. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study are the first to show that an SGA device can reduce postoperative pain after laparoscopic surgery.","Nagahisa, Y; Hashida, K; Matsumoto, R; Kawashima, R; Okabe, M; Kawamoto, K",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,216,1

METHODS Death data of registered residents of Suzhou from 2014 to 2020 were collected and the weekly mortality rates due to respiratory disease and all deaths were analyzed. The differences in mortality rates during the pandemic and the same period in previous years were compared. RESULTS Before the pandemic, the crude mortality rate (CMR) and standardized mortality rate (SMR) of Suzhou residents including respiratory disease, were not much different from those in previous years. During the emergency period, the CMR of Suzhou residents was 180.2/100,000 and the SMR was 85.5/100,000, decreasing by 9.1% and 14.6%, respectively; the CMR of respiratory disease was 16.4/100,000 and the SMR was 6.8/100,000, down 41.4% and 44.9%, respectively. Regardless of the mortality rates of all deaths or respiratory disease, the rates were higher in males than in females, although males had aslightly greater decrease in all deaths during the emergency period compared with females, and the opposite was true for respiratory disease.

For example, EVs secreted by stem cells injected into infarcted hearts can induce recovery through the delivery of stem-cell-specific miRNAs. However, the retention of the EVs and the therapeutic effects are short-lived. Here, we show that an engineered hydrogel patch capable of slowly releasing EVs secreted from cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells reduced arrhythmic burden, promoted ejection-fraction recovery, decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis 24 hours after infarction, and reduced infarct size and cell hypertrophy 4 weeks post-infarction when implanted onto infarcted rat hearts. We also show that the EVs are enriched with cardiac-specific miRNAs known to modulate cardiomyocyte-specific processes. The extended delivery of EVs secreted from iPS-cell-derived cardiomyocytes into the heart may help understand heart recovery and treat heart injury.","Liu, Bohao; Lee, Benjamin W; Nakanishi, Koki; Villasante, Aranzazu; Williamson, Rebecca; Metz, Jordan; Kim, Jinho; Kanai, Mariko; Bi, Lynn; Brown, Kristy; Di Paolo, Gilbert; Homma, Shunichi; Sims, Peter A; Topkara, Veli K; Vunjak-Novakovic, Gordana",Nature biomedical engineering,216,17

No studies have evaluated long-term tolerability of this new technique in regards to chronic pain and hernia recurrence. METHODS Prospective longitudinal evaluation study of consecutive patients treated with Endoloop™ for M2 or M3 direct defects, during endoscopic totally extraperitoneal approach. Meshes were secured with fibrin sealant only. All patients had a minimum 2.8 years (median 5.9 years) follow-up. First outcome was chronic groin/testicular pain; secondary outcome parameters included hernia recurrence and Quality of Life (QoL). Patients were assessed by phone interview using the validated Carolinas Comfort Scale (CCS), questioned regarding recurrence and asked to present for clinical review as needed. RESULTS 112 patients (median age 57 years) with 141 direct hernia defects were included during the study period of 2008-2014. An Endoloop™ was used on 127 occasions-79 M2 and 48 M3 direct hernias. One patient had an early recurrence requiring an open repair and was therefore excluded. Thirty-three of the remaining one hundred and eleven patients (29.7%) were lost to long-term follow-up. According to their CCS range, 70 patients (88.6%) were very satisfied with their results, 8 (10.1%) were satisfied, and only one patient (1.3%) who reported chronic groin pain was unsatisfied. There was no reported long-term hernia recurrence. CONCLUSION The PDS Endoloop™ technique for closure of direct inguinal hernia defects is well tolerated with low risk of hernia recurrence, chronic pain, and excellent QoL.

Recurrence rates after complex ventral hernia repair remain high, and increase with each failed attempt. This study examines the effect of pre-operative abdominal wall chemical component relaxation using Botulinum Toxin A (BTA) to induce temporary flaccid paralysis in order to facilitate laparoscopic repair of large complex ventral hernia. METHODS This is a prospective evaluation of 27 patients from January 2013 to August 2015 who underwent ultrasound guided BTA injections to the lateral abdominal wall muscles prior to elective complex ventral hernia repair. Non-contrast serial CT imaging was obtained pre- and post-BTA injection to measure change in fascial defect size and abdominal wall muscle thickness and length. Fascial defects were closed and hernias repaired using laparoscopic or laparoscopic-assisted intra-peritoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) techniques. RESULTS 27 patients received pre-operative BTA injections which were well tolerated with no complications. Comparison of pre-BTA and post-BTA CT imaging demonstrated a significant increase in mean length of the lateral abdominal wall from 15.7 cm pre-BTA to 19.9 cm post-BTA (p < 0.0001), with mean unstretched length gain of 4.2 cm/side (range 0-11.7 cm/side). All hernias were surgically reduced and repaired with mesh, with no early recurrences. CONCLUSION Pre-operative administration of BTA is a safe and effective technique in the pre-operative preparation of patients undergoing elective complex ventral hernia repair. This technique lengthens and relaxes the laterally retracted abdominal muscles and enables laparoscopic closure of large complex ventral hernia.","Elstner, K E; Jacombs, A S W; Read, J W; Rodriguez, O; Edye, M; Cosman, P H; Dardano, A N; Zea, A; Boesel, T; Mikami, D J; Craft, C; Ibrahim, N",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,216,19

OBJECTIVE To conduct a metanalysis of the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration and SARS-CoV-2 infection severity or mortality. MATERIAL AND METHODS We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Google scholar and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for studies published between December 2019 and December 2020. Effect statistics were pooled using random effects models. The quality of included studies was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Targeted outcomes: mortality and severity proportions in COVID-19 patients with 25(OH)D deficiency, defined as serum 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L. RESULTS In the 23 studies included (n = 2692), the mean age was 60.8 (SD ± 15.9) years and 53.8% were men. Results suggested that vitamin 25(OH)D deficiency was associated with increased risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease (RR 2.00; 95% CI 1.47-2.71, 17 studies) and mortality (RR 2.45; 95% CI 1.24-4.84, 13 studies). Only 7/23 studies reported C-reactive protein values, all of which were > 10 mg/L. Conclusions 25(OH)D deficiency seems associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 infection severity and mortality. However, findings do not imply causality, and randomized controlled trials are required, and new studies should be designed to determine if decreased 25(OH)D is an epiphenomenon or consequence of the inflammatory process associated with severe forms of SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, the concentration of 25(OH)D could be considered as a negative acute phase reactant and a poor prognosis in COVID-19 infection.","Oscanoa, Teodoro J; Amado, José; Vidal, Xavier; Laird, Eamon; Ghashut, Rawia A; Romero-Ortuno, Roman",Advances in respiratory medicine,216,24

Methods We retrospectively enrolled 357 consecutive occult OGIB patients (203 men; mean age: 59.7 years) who underwent capsule endoscopy (CE) at Hiroshima University Hospital, Japan and were followed up for more than 12 months (mean follow-up period; 50.2 months). Patients were divided into three groups as follows: Group A consisted of 98 of 157 patients who had positive findings and indication for treatment, Group B consisted of 59 of 157 patients who had positive findings but no indication for treatment, and Group C consisted of 200 patients who had negative small-bowel findings. We examined the rate of positive CE findings, detection rate and details of bleeding sources, overt bleeding rate, the rate of anemia exacerbation, 5-year anemia exacerbation rate, and overall survival rate. Results The positive CE findings rate was 44% (157/357) and detection rate of bleeding source was 27% (98/357).

Environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted from water samples is an efficient and versatile approach to detecting aquatic animals. In the ocean, eDNA composition reflects local fauna at fine spatial scales, but little is known about the effectiveness of eDNA-based monitoring of marine communities at larger scales. We investigated the potential of eDNA to characterize and distinguish marine communities at large spatial scales by comparing vertebrate species composition among marine habitats in Qatar, the Arabian Gulf (also known as the Persian Gulf), based on eDNA metabarcoding of seawater samples. We conducted species accumulation analyses to estimate how much of the vertebrate diversity we detected. We obtained eDNA sequences from a diverse assemblage of marine vertebrates, spanning 191 taxa in 73 families. These included rare and endangered species and covered 36% of the bony fish genera previously recorded in the gulf. Sites of similar habitat type were also similar in eDNA composition. The species accumulation analyses showed that the number of sample replicates was insufficient for some sampling sites but suggested that a few hundred eDNA samples could potentially capture >90% of the marine vertebrate diversity in the study area. Our results confirm that seawater samples contain habitat-characteristic molecular signatures and that eDNA monitoring can efficiently cover vertebrate diversity at scales relevant to national and regional conservation and management.

However, direct measurements of the vagal control are difficult. The novel deceleration capacity (DC) of heart rate measure has been used to characterize the vagal modulation. This study aimed to assess vagal control in VVS patients and evaluate the diagnostic value of the DC in VVS. Methods - Altogether 161 consecutive VVS patients (43 ± 15 years; 62 males) were enrolled. Tilt table test (TTT) was positive in 101 and negative in 60 patients. Sixty-five healthy subjects were enrolled as controls. DC and heart rate variability (HRV) in 24-hour electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and biochemical examinations were compared between the syncope and control groups. Results - DC was significantly higher in the syncope group than in the control group (9.6 ± 3.3 ms vs. 6.5 ± 2.0 ms, P0.001). DC was similarly increased in VVS patients with a positive and negative TTT (9.7±3.5 ms and 9.4±2.9 ms, P=0.614). In multivariable logistic regression analyses, DC was independently associated with syncope (OR=1.518, 95% CI 1.301-1.770, P =0.0001). For the prediction of syncope, the area under curve (AUC) analysis showed similar values when comparing single DC and combined DC with other risk factors (P=0.1147). From the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves for syncope discrimination, the optimal cut-off value for the DC was 7.12 ms. Conclusion - DC > 7.5 ms may serve as a good tool to monitor cardiac vagal activity and discriminate VVS, particularly in those with negative TTT.","Zheng, Lihui; Sun, Wei; Liu, Shangyu; Liang, Erpeng; Du, Zhongpeng; Guo, Jingrui; Wu, Lingmin; Asirvatham, Samuel J; Yao, Yan",Circulation.

We sought to create such a definition. DESIGN A subgroup of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome investigators who drafted a pediatric-specific definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome based on consensus opinion and supported by detailed literature review tested elements of the definition with patient data from previously published investigations. SETTINGS International PICUs. SUBJECTS Children enrolled in published investigations of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Several aspects of the proposed pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome definition align with the Berlin Definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults: timing of acute respiratory distress syndrome after a known risk factor, the potential for acute respiratory distress syndrome to coexist with left ventricular dysfunction, and the importance of identifying a group of patients at risk to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome. There are insufficient data to support any specific age for ""adult"" acute respiratory distress syndrome compared with ""pediatric"" acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, children with perinatal-related respiratory failure should be excluded from the definition of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. Larger departures from the Berlin Definition surround 1) simplification of chest imaging criteria to eliminate bilateral infiltrates; 2) use of pulse oximetry-based criteria when PaO2 is unavailable; 3) inclusion of oxygenation index and oxygen saturation index instead of PaO2/FIO2 ratio with a minimum positive end-expiratory pressure level for invasively ventilated patients; 4) and specific inclusion of children with preexisting chronic lung disease or cyanotic congenital heart disease. CONCLUSIONS This pediatric-specific definition for acute respiratory distress syndrome builds on the adult-based Berlin Definition, but has been modified to account for differences between adults and children with acute respiratory distress syndrome. We propose using this definition for future investigations and clinical care of children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome and encourage external validation with the hope for continued iterative refinement of the definition.","Khemani, Robinder G; Smith, Lincoln S; Zimmerman, Jerry J; Erickson, Simon",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,216,27

SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence in human faecal samples and SARS-CoV-2 activity in faeces from COVID-19 patients have been observed. Methods Starting from these observations, an experimental design was developed to cultivate in vitro faecal microbiota from infected individuals, to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2, and to collect data on the relationship between faecal bacteria and the virus. Results Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 replicates in vitro in bacterial growth medium, that the viral replication follows bacterial growth and it is influenced by the administration of specific antibiotics. SARS-CoV-2-related peptides have been detected in 30-day bacterial cultures and characterised. Discussion Our observations are compatible with a 'bacteriophage-like' behaviour of SARS-CoV-2, which, to our knowledge has not been observed or described before. These results are unexpected and hint towards a novel hypothesis on the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and on the COVID-19 epidemiology. The discovery of possible new modes of action of SARS-CoV-2 has far-reaching implications for the prevention and the treatment of the disease.","Petrillo, Mauro; Brogna, Carlo; Cristoni, Simone; Querci, Maddalena; Piazza, Ornella; Van den Eede, Guy",F1000Research,216,1

Antibacterial mouthwash may reduce gonorrhoea transmission without using antibiotics. We modelled the effect that antiseptic mouthwash may have on the incidence of gonorrhoea. DESIGN We developed a mathematical model of the transmission of gonorrhoea between each anatomical site (oropharynx, urethra and anorectum) in men who have sex with men (MSM). We constructed four scenarios: (1) mouthwash had no effect; (2) mouthwash increased the susceptibility of the oropharynx; (3) mouthwash reduced the transmissibility from the oropharynx; (4) the combined effect of mouthwash from scenarios 2 and 3. SETTING We used data at three anatomical sites from 4873 MSM attending Melbourne Sexual Health Centre in 2018 and 2019 to calibrate our models and data from the USA, Netherlands and Thailand for sensitivity analyses. PARTICIPANTS Published available data on MSM with multisite infections of gonorrhoea. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Incidence of gonorrhoea. RESULTS The overall incidence of gonorrhoea was 44 (95% CI 37 to 50)/100 person-years (PY) in scenario 1. Under scenario 2 (20%-80% mouthwash coverage), the total incidence increased (47-60/100 PY) and at all three anatomical sites by between 7.4% (5.9%-60.8%) and 136.6% (108.1%-177.5%). Under scenario 3, with the same coverage, the total incidence decreased (20-39/100 PY) and at all anatomical sites by between 11.6% (10.2%-13.5%) and 99.8% (99.2%-100%). Under scenario 4, changes in the incidence depended on the efficacy of mouthwash on the susceptibility or transmissibility. The effect on the total incidence varied (22-55/100 PY), and at all anatomical sites, there were increases of nearly 130% and large declines of almost 100%. CONCLUSIONS The effect of mouthwash on gonorrhoea incidence is largely predictable depending on whether it increases susceptibility to or reduces the transmissibility of gonorrhoea.","Xu, Xianglong; Chow, Eric P F; Shen, Mingwang; Zou, Zhuoru; Wang, Chongjian; Ong, Jason J; Fairley, Christopher K; Zhang, Lei",BMJ open,216,1

Although the benefits of running are numerous, there is a risk of Running Related Injuries (RRIs) of the lower extremities. Electromyography (EMG) techniques have previously been used to study causes of RRIs, but the complexity of this technology limits its use to a laboratory setting. As running is primarily an outdoors activity, this lack of technology acts as a barrier to the study of RRIs in natural environments. This study presents a minimally invasive wearable muscle sensing device consisting of jogging leggings with embroidered surface EMG (sEMG) electrodes capable of recording muscle activity data of the quadriceps group. To test the use of the device, a proof of concept study consisting of N = 2 runners performing a set of 5 km running trials is presented in which the effect of running surfaces on muscle fatigue, a potential cause of RRIs, is evaluated. Results show that muscle fatigue can be analysed from the sEMG data obtained through the wearable device, and that running on soft surfaces (such as sand) may increase the likelihood of suffering from RRIs.","Manero, R B Ribas; Shafti, A; Michael, B; Grewal, J; Fernandez, J Ll Ribas; Althoefer, K; Howard, M J; Ribas Manero, R B; Ribas Fernandez, J Ll",Conference proceedings : ...

A comprehensive sequence analysis was performed to assign the framework and complementary-determining regions. The scFv exerted particular binding sites to KDR3 on molecular docking, and the binding affinity was further convinced by binding analysis both in quantitative ELISA and real-time kinetic determination by biosensors (K(D) = 40 nM). Finally, the scFv was revealed to inhibit VEGF-stimulated proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs; IC(50) = 5 nM) and to inhibit HUVEC migration significantly at 17 nM. Taken together, our results indicate that we have successfully isolated a scFv which differentially recognizes KDR3 and has potential clinical applications in the treatment of angiogenesis related diseases.","Zhang, Juan; Li, Haixin; Wang, Xiuyun; Qi, Haidi; Miao, Xiaoniu; Zhang, Tao; Chen, Guosheng; Wang, Min",Biotechnology progress,216,30

Communication strategies and scaffolds, specifically through augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), offer vital compensatory support for persons with dementia in an attempt to maintain the latter's quality of life and well-being through participation with others. To date, no research review has been published that synthesizes the current research of AAC in the field of dementia. AIMS To provide an overview of current AAC strategies and techniques used for supporting communication in dementia by surveying the literature base in a systematic manner, synthesizing the findings and highlighting trends and gaps. METHODS & PROCEDURES A multifaceted search strategy included nine electronic database searches, using specific keywords. Application of predefined selection criteria during screening procedures led to the inclusion of 39 studies. Data were extracted and studies synthesized according to communication partners; description of AAC strategies and techniques; outcome measures; and communication outcomes. MAIN CONTRIBUTION This review shows that the majority of the research to date has focused on supporting the interactions of persons with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) using non-electronic memory and communication aids. Future research should focus on social participation and person-centred communication to optimize functional communication with AAC. Training programmes targeting dyadic interaction and supporting persons with dementia from diverse ethnic backgrounds are avenues for further research.

Due to a lack of effective screening methods, most cases are diagnosed at later stages where the survival rates are poor. Thus, it is termed a 'silent killer' and is the most lethal of all the malignancies in women. IQ motif containing GTPase Activating Protein 3 (IQGAP3) is a member of the Rho family of GTPases, and plays a crucial role in the development and progression of several types of cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the oncogenic functions and mechanisms of IQGAP3 on the proliferation and metastasis of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Therefore, the expression levels of IQGAP3 in HGSOC and normal tissue samples were compared, and IQGAP3 knockdown was performed to examine its functional role using various in vitro and in vivo experiments. It was demonstrated that the expression of IQGAP3 was upregulated in HGSOC tissues compared with the healthy tissues; this differential expression was also observed in the ovarian cancer cell lines. Functional experimental results suggested that IQGAP3 silencing significantly reduced proliferation, migration and invasion in ovarian cancer cell lines. Moreover, in vivo experimental findings validated the in vitro results, where the tumorigenic and metastatic capacities of IQGAP3-silenced cells were significantly lower in the nude mice compared with the mice implanted with the control cells. Furthermore, knockdown of IQGAP3 resulted in increased apoptosis, and the effects of IQGAP3 expression on various epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers were identified, suggesting a possible mechanism associated with the role of IQGAP3 in metastasis. The effect of IQGAP3 silencing on chemosensitivity towards olaparib was also assessed. Collectively, the present results indicated that IQGAP3 is a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker, and a putative therapeutic target of HGSOC.","Dongol, Samina; Zhang, Qing; Qiu, Chunping; Sun, Chenggong; Zhang, Zhiwei; Wu, Huan; Kong, Beihua",Oncology letters,216,1

METHODS A self-designed questionnaire was used to conduct an online survey for 4 139 Hunan residents. The contents included general population information, residents' knowledge, attitude and practice to COVID-19. RESULTS Mean scores of knowledge, attitude, and behavior were 29.82±3.16, 6.71±1.12, and 14.93±1.45, respectively. Residents had the highest score of major symptoms of COVID-19 (3.96±0.39), but the lowest was the main transmission routes (3.47±0.89). A total of 22.68% of the residents were very or relatively afraid of the outbreak, but 95.22% of the residents had confidence in defeating COVID-19. In behavior dimension, ""handling of suspicious symptoms"" had the lowest score (3.58±0.75). The behavior implementation rate of ""keep the surfaces of household items clean"" (80.50%), ""doing more exercise, reasonable diet, working and resting regularly"" (84.59%), and ""avoid hand contacting with eyes, mouth or nose"" (89.51%) were relatively low. Pearson correlation coefficient showed that the knowledge, attitude, and practices score were correlated with each other (knowledge vs behavior: r=0.366; knowledge vs attitude: r=0.041; attitude vs behavior: r=0.100; all P<0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the knowledge, attitude and behavior on COVID-19 were mostly influenced by education background (all P<0.05), and the independent factors affecting behavior included knowledge and attitude, gender, permanent residence, education background (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Residents in Hunan Province have a good knowledge, attitude, and behavior to COVID-19. Nevertheless there are still weak links to be improved in all dimensions. It is necessary to strengthen knowledge and behavior of family protection, and care for residents' psychological health, especially persons with low education degree, male and rural residents.","Li, Chunyan; Xu, Jingcan; Yue, Liqing; Shen, Minxue; Dai, Minhui; Liu, Neng",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING Literature review. RESULTS The general challenges associated with the available infrastructure include their sporadic nature or limited coverage of issues and countries, whereas the specific ones related to policy-relevant syntheses of quasi-experimental evidence include the lack of mechanism to register synthesis titles and scoping review protocols, the limited number of groups preparing user-friendly summaries, and the difficulty of finding quasi-experimental studies for inclusion in rapid syntheses and research syntheses more generally. Although some new tools have emerged in recent years, such as guidance workbooks and citizen briefs and panels, challenges related to using available tools to support the use of policy-relevant syntheses of quasi-experimental evidence arise from such studies potentially being harder for policymakers and stakeholders to commission and understand.

METHODS Tertiary center retrospective analysis of consecutive patients admitted for LGIB between 2006 and 2012. Comparison of patients with LE vs. CTA as first exam, respectively, with emphasis on diagnostic accuracy and bleeding control. RESULTS Final analysis included 183 patients; 122 (66.7%) had LE first, while 32 (17.5%) had CTA; 29 (15.8%) had neither of both exams. Median time to CTA was shorter compared to LE (3 (IQR = 8.2) vs. 22 (IQR = 36.9) hours, P < 0.001). Active bleeding was identified in 31% with CTA vs. 15% with LE (P = 0.031); a non-actively bleeding source was found by CTA and LE in 22 vs. 31%, respectively (P = 0.305). Bleeding control required endoscopy in 19%, surgery in 14% and embolization in 1.6%, while 66% were treated conservatively. Post-interventional bleeding was mostly controlled by endoscopic therapy (57%). 80% of patients with active bleeding on CTA required surgery. CONCLUSIONS Post-interventional LGIB was effectively addressed by LE. For other causes of LGIB, CTA was efficient, and more available than colonoscopy. Treatment was conservative for most patients. In case of active bleeding, CTA could localize the bleeding source and predict the need for surgery.","Clerc, Daniel; Grass, Fabian; Schäfer, Markus; Denys, Alban; Demartines, Nicolas; Hübner, Martin",World journal of emergency surgery : WJES,216,1

Surfactant therapy, antenatal steroids and incremental improvements in perinatal care have modified the pattern of injury and allowed survival of ever more immature infants, but there is still no specific treatment for BPD. As a consequence, this disorder remains the most common complication of extreme prematurity. Arrested alveolar growth and disrupted vasculogenesis, the histological hallmarks of BPD, may persist beyond childhood and lead to chronic lung diseases in adults. Recent advances in our understanding of stem cells and their potential to repair damaged organs offer the possibility for cell-based treatment for intractable diseases. This review summarizes basic concepts of stem cell biology and discusses the recent advances and challenges of stem cell-based therapies for lung diseases, with a particular focus on BPD.","Alphonse, Rajesh S; Thébaud, Bernard",Neonatology,216,1

The pandemic has adversely affected frontline health workers and patients, owing to poor preparedness. The study explored the triggers of mental health problems among frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. An exploratory qualitative approach was utilised in the study. Forty individual semi-structured interviews were held with frontline healthcare workers. A thematic approach underpinned by some aspects of interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) and the Silences Framework (SF) was utilised. The research found that triggers of mental health problems among frontline health workers in private care homes and domiciliary care agencies are fear of infection and infecting others, lack of recognition/disparity between National Health Service (NHS) and social care, lack of guidance, unsafe hospital discharge, death and loss of professionals and residents, unreliable testing and delayed results and shortage of staff.

Tranexamic acid had been an effective haemostatic agent in reducing post-operative and traumatic bleeding. We review current evidence examining the efficacy of tranexamic acid in improving clinical outcome after ICH. Method We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and clinical trial registers for studies using search strategies incorporating the terms 'intracerebral haemorrhage', 'tranexamic acid' and 'antifibrinolytic'. Authors of ongoing clinical trials were contacted for further details. Findings We screened 268 publications and retrieved 17 articles after screening. Unpublished information from three ongoing clinical trials was obtained. We found five completed studies. Of these, two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intravenous tranexamic acid to placebo (n = 54) reported no significant difference in death or dependency. Three observational studies (n = 281) suggested less haematoma growth with rapid tranexamic acid infusion. There are six ongoing RCTs (n = 3089) with different clinical exclusions, imaging selection criteria (spot sign and haematoma volume), time window for recruitment and dosing of tranexamic acid. Discussion Despite their heterogeneity, the ongoing trials will provide key evidence on the effects of tranexamic acid on ICH. There are uncertainties of whether patients with negative spot sign, large haematoma, intraventricular haemorrhage, or poor Glasgow Coma Scale should be recruited. The time window for optimal effect of haemostatic therapy in ICH is yet to be established. Conclusion Tranexamic acid is a promising haemostatic agent for ICH. We await the results of the trials before definite conclusions can be drawn.","Law, Zhe Kang; Meretoja, Atte; Engelter, Stefan T; Christensen, Hanne; Muresan, Eugenia-Maria; Glad, Solveig B; Liu, Liping; Bath, Philip M; Sprigg, Nikola",European stroke journal,216,12

Several experimental approaches that reduce inflammation also result in attenuation of depressive symptoms. We have demonstrated that Resolvin D1 (RvD1), a metabolite of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) derived from docosahexaenoic acid, diminishes infarct size and neutrophil accumulation in the ischemic myocardium. The aim of this study is to determine if a single RvD1 injection could alleviate depressive symptoms in a rat model of MI. MI was induced in rats by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 40 min. Five minutes before ischemia or after reperfusion, 0.1 μg of RvD1 or vehicle was injected in the left ventricle cavity. Fourteen days after MI, behavioral tests (forced swim test and socialization) were conducted to evaluate depression-like symptoms. RvD1 reduced infarct size in the treated vs. the vehicle group. Animals receiving RvD1 also showed better performance in the forced swim and social interaction tests vs. vehicle controls. These results indicate that a single RvD1 dose, given 5 min before occlusion or 5 min after the onset of reperfusion, decreases infarct size and attenuates depression-like symptoms.","Gilbert, Kim; Bernier, Judith; Godbout, Roger; Rousseau, Guy",Marine drugs,216,19

As a poignant case study, this mixed methods study examined Whiteness socialization among White mothers (N = 392, M = 37.99 years, SD = 4.34) in Minneapolis, Minnesota in the month following the May 2020 police killing of unarmed Black resident, George Floyd. Using Helms' (1984, 2017) White racial identity development theory (WRID), content analyses of qualitative responses classified participants into lower versus higher levels of WRID, after which thematic analyses compared their Whiteness socialization beliefs/values, attitudes, practices, and emotions, and analyses of variance compared their demographics, multiculturalism, and psychological distress. There was strong convergence across qualitative and quantitative findings and results aligned with the WRID model. Racially silent participants (i.e., no mention of Floyd's murder or subsequent events on open-ended questions: 53%) had lower multiculturalism scores and lower psychological distress. Among mothers who were racially responsive (i.e., mentioned Floyd's murder or subsequent events: 47%), those with more advanced WRID (17%) had higher multiculturalism scores; lower ethnic group protectiveness scores; a more effective coping style featuring empathy, moral outrage, and hope; more color- and power-conscious socialization beliefs/values; and more purposeful racial socialization practices than their less advanced peers (30%). Collectively, color-evasion and power-evasion-pathogens of the Whiteness pandemic-are inexorably transmitted within families, with White parents serving as carriers to their children unless they take active preventive measures rooted in antiracism and equity-promotion.

Although each immigrant group has unique histories, current patterns, and specific experiences, racialized immigrant groups such as Latino, Asian, and Arab immigrants all experience health inequities that are not solely due to nativity or years of residence but also influenced by conditional citizenship and subjective sense of belonging or othering. Critical race theory and intersectionality provide a critical lens to consider how structural racism might uniquely impact the health of racialized immigrants, and to understand and intervene on the interlocking systems that shape these shared experiences and health consequences. We build on and synthesize the work of prior scholars to advance how society codifies structural disadvantages for racialized immigrants into governmental and institutional policies and how that affects health via three key pathways that emerged from our review of the literature: (1) formal racialization via immigration policy and citizenship status that curtails access to material and health resources and political and civic participation; (2) informal racialization via disproportionate immigration enforcement and criminalization including ongoing threats of detention and deportation; and (3) intersections with economic exploitation and disinvestment such as labor exploitation and neighborhood disinvestment. We hope this serves as a call to action to change the dominant narratives around immigrant health, provides conceptual and methodological recommendations to advance research, and illuminates the essential role of the public health sector to advocate for changes in other sectors including immigration policy, political rights, law enforcement, labor protections, and neighborhood investment, among others.","Misra, Supriya; Kwon, Simona C; Abraído-Lanza, Ana F; Chebli, Perla; Trinh-Shevrin, Chau; Yi, Stella S",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,216,33

The aims of this pilot study were to assess the utility of an electronic learning system for CCE (ELCCE) designed for the Japanese Association for Capsule Endoscopy using an objective scoring engine, and to evaluate the efficacy of ELCCE on the acquisition of CCE reading competence. METHODS ELCCE is an Internet-based learning system with the following steps: step 1, introduction; step 2, CCE reading competence assessment test (CCAT), which evaluates the competence of CCE reading prior to training; step 3, learning reading theory; step 4, training with guidance; step 5, training without guidance; step 6, final assessment; and step 7, the same as step 2. The CCAT, step 5 and step 6 were scored automatically according to: lesion detection, diagnosis (location, size, shape of lesion), management recommendations, and quality of view. Ten trainee endoscopists were initially recruited (cohort 1), followed by a validating cohort of 11 trainee endoscopists (cohort 2). RESULTS All but one participant finished ELCCE training within 7 weeks. In step 6, accuracy ranged from 53 to 98 % and was not impacted by step 2 pretest scores.

Relationships between imaging findings and clinical and imaging outcomes in patients randomized to intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator-alone versus tissue-type plasminogen activator plus endovascular therapy (Solitaire device) in the Solitaire With the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke (SWIFT PRIME) study were assessed. METHODS We evaluated associations between imaging assessments (baseline mismatch profiles/ischemic core volumes and successful reperfusion) with imaging outcomes (27-hour infarct volume/growth) and clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale scores at 90 days). Imaging variables that predict favorable clinical outcomes were assessed in both univariate and multivariate models. RESULTS One hundred and ninety-five patients were included. Successful reperfusion and infarct volume (assessed at 27 hours) were powerful independent predictors of favorable clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 90 days). Patients with the target mismatch profile at baseline had a higher rate of reperfusion, lesser infarct growth, smaller infarct volumes, and better clinical outcomes in the Solitaire plus tissue-type plasminogen activator (intervention) group than those in the tissue-type plasminogen activator-alone (control) group. Patients with larger mismatch volumes at baseline had a trend toward better treatment response in the intervention group than patients who had smaller (<50 mL) mismatch volumes. CONCLUSIONS Patients who achieved reperfusion had substantially more favorable clinical and imaging outcomes in both the intervention and the control groups. Infarct volume at 27 hours strongly correlated with clinical outcome at 90 days in both treatment groups. SWIFT PRIME patients with the target mismatch profile had a highly favorable response to endovascular therapy on both clinical and imaging outcomes.

METHODS We investigate nuclear structure and chromosome organization in HD blood cells using fluorescence in situ hybridization in ultrathin cryosections (cryoFISH), coupled with machine learning image analysis to evaluate size, distribution, and morphology of nuclei and chromosomes. Four chromosomes were analyzed based on up- or downregulation of gene expression in HD. RESULTS We show that blood cells from HD patients display increased nuclear size and filamentary shape, increased size of gene-rich chromosome 19, decreased filamentary shape of gene-rich chromosome 22, and a more radially centralized position for chromosome 19, whereas chromosomes 4 and 5 do not show detectable differences.

A common point of access to health care for the migrant population is via the primary health care network in the country of resettlement. This review aims to synthesize the evidence of primary health care interventions to improve the quality of health care provided to refugees and asylum seekers. METHODS A systematic review was undertaken, and 55 articles were included in the final review. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews was used to guide the reporting of the review, and articles were managed using a reference-management software (Covidence). The findings were analysed using a narrative empirical synthesis. A quality assessment was conducted for all the studies included. RESULTS The interventions within the broad primary care setting could be organized into four categories, that is, those that focused on developing the skills of individual refugees/asylum seekers and their families; skills of primary health care workers; system and/or service integration models and structures; and lastly, interventions enhancing communication services. Promoting effective health care delivery for refugees, asylum seekers and their families is a complex challenge faced by primary care professionals, the patients themselves and the communication between them. CONCLUSION This review highlights the innovative interventions in primary care promoting refugee health. Primary care interventions mostly focused on upskilling doctors, with a paucity of research exploring the involvement of other health care members. Further research can explore the involvement of interprofessional team members in providing effective refugee/migrant health.

The prevalence of DAH is reported to range from 1 to 5%, but while DAH is considered a rare complication there is a reported 50-80% mortality. There is at present no proven effective treatment for DAH and the therapeutics that have been tested have significant side effects. There is a clear necessity to discover new drugs to improve outcomes in DAH. Serine protease inhibitors, serpins, regulate thrombotic and thrombolytic protease cascades. We are investigating a Myxomavirus derived immune modulating serpin, Serp-1, as a new class of immune modulating therapeutics for vasculopathy and lung hemorrhage. Serp-1 has proven efficacy in models of herpes virus-induced arterial inflammation (vasculitis) and lung hemorrhage and has also proved safe in a clinical trial in patients with unstable coronary syndromes and stent implant. Here, we examine Serp-1, both as a native secreted protein expressed by CHO cells and as a polyethylene glycol modified (PEGylated) variant (Serp-1m5), for potential therapy in DAH. DAH was induced by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of pristane in C57BL/6J (B6) mice. Mice were treated with 100 ng/g bodyweight of either Serp-1 as native 55 kDa secreted glycoprotein, or as Serp-1m5, or saline controls after inducing DAH. Treatments were repeated daily for 14 days (6 mice/group). Serp-1 partially and Serp-1m5 significantly reduced pristane-induced DAH when compared with saline as assessed by gross pathology and H&E staining (Serp-1, p = 0.2172; Serp-1m5, p = 0.0252). Both Serp-1m5 and Serp-1 treatment reduced perivascular inflammation and reduced M1 macrophage (Serp-1, p = 0.0350; Serp-1m5, p = 0.0053), hemosiderin-laden macrophage (Serp-1, p = 0.0370; Serp-1m5, p = 0.0424) invasion, and complement C5b/9 staining. Extracellular urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor positive (uPAR+) clusters were significantly reduced (Serp-1, p = 0.0172; Serp-1m5, p = 0.0025). Serp-1m5 also increased intact uPAR+ alveoli in the lung (p = 0.0091). In conclusion, Serp-1m5 significantly reduces lung damage and hemorrhage in a pristane model of SLE DAH, providing a new potential therapeutic approach.","Guo, Qiuyun; Yaron, Jordan R; Wallen, John W; Browder, Kyle F; Boyd, Ryan; Olson, Tien L; Burgin, Michelle; Ulrich, Peaches; Aliskevich, Emily; Schutz, Lauren N; Fromme, Petra; Zhang, Liqiang; Lucas, Alexandra R",Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,216,1

The goal of this study is to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on rhinologic ambulatory and operative practice. METHODS A 27-item survey to assess these objectives was created and approved by the Division of Rhinology faculty at Rush University Medical Center in April 2020. The survey was then distributed to rhinologists in a web based format via www.surveymonkey.com from April 10 through April 23, 2020. RESULTS A total of 277 U.S based rhinologists responded to the survey (23.04%). The most common practice types were single specialty private (44.9%) and academic (24.6%). 90.2% practice in a state under a shelter in place order. Comparing pre-COVID baseline to during-COVID, there was statistically significant reduction in the number of patients of seen daily in clinic (p < 0.001). The number of nasal endoscopies in the office and surgical procedures fell dramatically. Overall, 5 respondent rhinologists have been infected with COVID-19 and 27 have been furloughed. CONCLUSION COVID-19 has drastically affected rhinologic practice. There is a dramatic reduction of in person care in the office setting and surgical management of sinonasal and skull base disease. Enhanced PPE is being used in only half of potentially aerosolizing procedures which represents an area of further education. Novel approaches such as use of virtual encounters and point of care testing should be considered as options to facilitate care.","Papagiannopoulos, P; Ganti, A; Kim, Y J; Raad, R A; Kuan, E C; Losavio, P; Tajudeen, B A; Batra, P S",American journal of rhinology & allergy,216,17

TV-1380 is a novel recombinant albumin-fused mutated butyrylcholinesterase (Albu-BChE) that has increased catalytic efficiency for cocaine compared with wild-type BChE and therefore has the potential to facilitate abstinence in cocaine-dependent subjects by decreasing exposure to cocaine and its reinforcing effects. METHODS This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in nondependent cocaine users was conducted to evaluate the effect of a single intramuscular dose of Albu-BChE (50, 100, and 300 mg) on the pharmacokinetic and metabolic profile of intravenous cocaine infusions (40 mg) administered at baseline and at 24, 96, and 168 hours after Albu-BChE dosing, to assess safety of coadministering Albu-BChE and cocaine, and to explore the subjective responses to cocaine infusions after Albu-BChE dosing. RESULTS Administration of Albu-BChE resulted in significant dose-dependent reductions in cocaine exposure (maximum concentration, area under the curve) and half-life. Effects were greatest at 24 hours after Albu-BChE dose, but were sustained up to 168 hours. Spearman correlations indicated a significant negative relationship between Albu-BChE concentration and cocaine clearance and exposure. Consistent with its mechanism of action, Albu-BChE also shifted cocaine metabolism toward preferential formation of ecgonine methyl ester. Administration of Albu-BChE was associated with modest decreases in subjective reports of feeling high and willingness to take cocaine again after cocaine infusion. Coadministration of Albu-BChE and cocaine was safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS Administration of Albu-BChE at single doses of 50, 100, and 300 mg safely resulted in long-lasting decreases in cocaine exposure in recreational cocaine users.","Shram, Megan J; Cohen-Barak, Orit; Chakraborty, Bijan; Bassan, Merav; Schoedel, Kerri A; Hallak, Hussein; Eyal, Eli; Weiss, Sivan; Gilgun-Serki, Yossi; Sellers, Edward M; Faulknor, Janice; Spiegelstein, Ofer",Journal of clinical psychopharmacology,216,20

MZ B cells have been shown to be important in mediating immunity to various bacteria including Streptococcus pneuomniae and are also implicated in inflammatory syndromes including lupus erythematosus. The intestinal microbiota is responsible for producing short chain fatty acids (SCFA), which can regulate immune cell function by several mechanisms including ligation of the G-protein coupled receptor, GPR43. Herein, we show that MZ B cells express Gpr43 mRNA and that the absence of this receptor impacts on MZ B cell surface marker expression and antibody production. In T cell-independent responses to the hapten 4-Hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetic acid (NP), mice deficient in GPR43 displayed higher serum titres of NP-specific antibodies. Moreover, in response to a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, GPR43-deficient mice developed robust serum antibody responses and had markedly increased numbers of splenic antibody-secreting cells, compared with control mice. Finally, serum IgM autoantibodies to double stranded DNA and phosphatidylcholine were increased in resting 10-15 week-old mice lacking GPR43. Taken together, mice lacking GPR43 have heightened antibody responses to T cell-independent antigens, which may be due to impaired regulation of MZ B cells.","Rohrbeck, Leona; Adori, Monika; Wang, Shan; He, Chenfei; Tibbitt, Christopher A; Chernyshev, Mark; Sirel, Madle; Ribacke, Ulf; Murrell, Ben; Bohlooly-Y, Mohammad; Ci Karlsson, Mikael; Karlsson Hedestam, Gunilla B; Coquet, Jonathan M",Immunology and cell biology,216,1

Composite and lightweight grafts have been developed to overcome adhesion and rigidity. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro S. epidermidis and S. aureus adherence to these new generation grafts, which have modified composition and textile properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this experimental study, sterile samples of multifilament polypropylene, multifilament lightweight composite, monofilament composite, and monofilament polypropylene grafts were incubated with slime positive S. epidermidis and S. aureus strains for 24 h. The grafts were washed and vortexed in saline. The saline was passaged to blood agar and incubated for 24 h. The colonies were counted. Naïve and incubated graft materials were examined by scanning electron microscopy to reveal both textile properties and biofilm formation. Physicochemical properties were evaluated. Wilcoxon signed ranks test and Friedman test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS S. epidermidis showed a significantly decreased adherence to monofilament polypropylene graft, and increased adherence to multifilament polypropylene graft (P<0.05). S. aureus showed a significant affinity for monofilament composite graft (P<0.05). SEM studies showed that biofilm formation was present on multifilament polypropylene graft. CONCLUSIONS Both S. epidermidis and S. aureus had significantly less adherence to multifilament lightweight composite than multifilament polypropylene graft. S. epidermidis showed a greater affinity to monofilament composite graft compared with monofilament polypropylene graft. Overall S. epidermidis adherence for multifilament lightweight composite and monofilament composite was less than multifilament polypropylene and higher than monofilament polypropylene. S. epidermidis and S. aureus showed different adherence for each graft. Changes in material composition and textile properties may well influence bacterial adherence.","Aydinuraz, Kuzey; Ağalar, Canan; Ağalar, Fatih; Ceken, Sabahat; Duruyürek, Nihal; Vural, Tayfun",The Journal of surgical research,216,1

METHODS A systematic Medline and repositories search concerning the usefulness of aripiprazole in bipolar disorder was performed, with the combination of the words 'aripiprazole' and 'bipolar'. RESULTS The search returned 184 articles and was last updated on 15 April 2009. An additional search included repositories of clinical trials and previous systematic reviews specifically in order to trace unpublished trials. There were seven placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials (RCTs), six with comparator studies and one with add-on studies. They assessed the usefulness of aripiprazole in acute mania, acute bipolar depression and during the maintenance phase in comparison to placebo, lithium or haloperidol. CONCLUSION Aripiprazole appears effective for the treatment and prophylaxis against mania. The data on bipolar depression are so far negative, however there is a need for further study at lower dosages. The most frequent adverse effects are extrapyramidal signs and symptoms, especially akathisia, without any significant weight gain, hyperprolactinaemia or laboratory test changes.","Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N; Vieta, Eduard",Annals of general psychiatry,216,33

Many of the deaths related to it are due to a systemic inflammatory response, which has been called 'cytokine storm'. OBJECTIVES We developed a comprehensive review of the pathophysiology mechanisms of COVID-19 and of the rationale for drugs and therapeutics that have been tested in clinical trials. METHODS A narrative review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, SciELO, Bireme, Google Scholar and ClinicalTrials. RESULTS SARS-CoV-2 has evolutive mechanisms that made it spread all around the globe, as a higher latency period and a lesser lethality than other coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 causes a delay in the innate immune response and it disarranges the immune system leading to an overwhelming inflammatory reaction (the 'cytokine storm'). In this scenario, high levels of interleukins (IL), notably IL-6 and IL-1, create a positive feedback of chemokines and immune responses, and powers pulmonary and systemic tissue damage, leading to capillary leakage and SARS, the main cause of death in patients with COVID-19. On 17 July 2020, there were 1450 entries on ClinicalTrials.gov of ongoing studies on COVID-19. The mechanisms of the main therapeutic approaches were comprehensively reviewed throughout the text. Therapies focus on blocking viral entry (remdesivir, umifenovir, among others) and blocking of immune system for cytokine storm control (IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors, glucocorticoids, convalescent plasma, among others). CONCLUSIONS Understanding of action mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 enables us to direct efforts on effective therapeutic targets. This comprehensive review helps to interpret the clinical results of the several trials ongoing.","Mélo Silva Júnior, Mário Luciano de; Souza, Lívia Maria Alves de; Dutra, Renata Ellen Maria Carvalho; Valente, Ramon Gonçalves de Melo; Melo, Thayanara Silva",Postgraduate medical journal,216,1

A six-year old, FLG-protected Cu is visually shiny and detailed material characterizations capture no sign of oxidation. The success of the durable anticorrosion film depends on the misalignment of grain boundaries between adjacent graphene layers. Theoretical calculations further found that corrosive molecules always encounter extremely high energy barrier when diffusing through the FLG layers. Therefore, the FLG is able to prevent the corrosive molecules from reaching the underlying Cu surface. This work highlights the interesting structures of polycrystalline FLG and sheds insight into the atomically thin coatings for various applications.","Zhao, Zhijuan; Hou, Tianyu; Wu, Nannan; Jiao, Shuping; Zhou, Ke; Yin, Jun; Suk, Ji Won; Cui, Xu; Zhang, Mingfei; Li, Shaopeng; Qu, Yan; Xie, Weiguang; Li, Xi-Bo; Zhao, Chuanxi; Fu, Yong; Hong, Rong-Dun; Guo, Shengshi; Lin, Dingqu; Cai, Weiwei; Mai, Wenjie; Luo, Zhengtang; Tian, Yongtao; Lai, Yun; Liu, Yuanyue; Colombo, Luigi; Hao, Yufeng",Nano letters,216,1

As a result, each species has its own distinct pattern of steroids, steroidogenic enzymes, receptors, and transporters to support its individual physiological requirements. Although the circulating steroid profile is well characterized during equine pregnancy, there is much yet to be explored regarding the factors that support steroidogenesis and steroid signaling. To obtain a holistic view of steroid-related transcripts, we sequenced chorioallantois (45 days, 4 months, 6 months, 10 months, 11 months, and post-partum) and endometrium (4 months, 6 months, 10 months, 11 months, and diestrus) throughout gestation, then looked in-depth at transcripts related to steroid synthesis, conjugation, transportation, and signaling. Key findings include: 1) differential expression of HSD17B isoforms among tissues (HSD17B1 high in the chorioallantois, while HSD17B2 is the dominant form in the endometrium) 2) a novel isoform with homology to SULT1A1 is the predominant sulfotransferase transcript in the chorioallantois; and 3) nuclear estrogen (ESR1, ESR2) and progesterone (PGR) expression is minimal to nonexistant in the chorioallantois and pregnant endometrium. Additionally, several hypotheses have been formed, including the possibility that the 45-day chorioallantois is able to synthesize steroids de novo from acetate and that horses utilize glucuronidation to clear estrogens from the endometrium during estrous, but not during pregnancy. In summary, these findings represent an in-depth look at equine steroid-related transcripts through gestation, providing novel hypotheses and future directions for equine endocrine research.","Loux, S C; Conley, A J; Scoggin, K E; El-Sheikh Ali, H; Dini, P; Ball, B A",Reproduction,216,1

METHODS The data of all patients who were admitted to outpatient clinics at Hisar Intercontinental Hospital or the hospital's online patient portal system between March 11th and May 30th, 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Of all patients, 545 in outpatient clinics and 25 in online portal system, (17%) were hospitalized for medical treatment, and 53 underwent surgery. There were 1032 patients admitted to Urology Clinics and 104 patients who underwent surgery in the same period of 2019. The pre-operative assessment of patients who were candidates of urological surgery included certain criteria for COVID-19. RESULTS Of patients included in this study, the median age was 41 years (18-90). The mean hospital stay was 1 day (1-12), and the mean duration of operation was 25 min (3-250). Thirty-seven patients (69.8%) underwent general anesthesia, while only 11(20.8%) underwent combined spinal epidural anesthesia. Four patients (7.5%) required local and only one patient (1.9%) underwent sedo-analgesia. Complications were encountered in six patients (11.4%), urosepsis in two, pneumonia in one, and urinary tract infection in three patients.

The contribution of forest carbon sink is well-known, but the carbon sink function of mariculture is rarely known. Based on the statistics of China's fishery department and the quality assessment method, this paper constructed a preliminary accounting system for the removable carbon sink of mariculture shellfish and algae, and estimated its capacity in China from 2005 to 2017. On this basis, the logarithmic mean Divisia index was used to analyze the effects of structure and scale factors on the removable carbon sink of mariculture shellfish and algae. The results showed that the annual average removable carbon sink of shellfish and algae in China's mariculture reached 92.7 ten thousand tons, and the overall trend was upward. The total removable carbon sink of shellfish was greater than that of algae. Among them, Grassastrea gigas was the main source of removable carbon sink in China's mariculture, followed by Ruditapes philippinarum. The economic value of annual removable carbon sink of mariculture shellfish and algae in China was equivalent to 139-556 million dollars. Furthermore, the scale factor plays a leading role in the removable carbon sink capacity of mariculture in China, while the structure factor plays a minor role.","Ren, Wenhan",Environmental science and pollution research international,216,5

Digital mental health interventions can address the treatment gap in low- and middle-income countries, but the effectiveness in these countries is unknown. Objective To investigate the effectiveness of a digital intervention in reducing depressive symptoms among people with diabetes and/or hypertension. Design, Setting, and Participants Participants with clinically significant depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9] score ≥10) who were being treated for hypertension and/or diabetes were enrolled in a cluster randomized clinical trial (RCT) at 20 sites in São Paulo, Brazil (N=880; from September 2016 to September 2017; final follow-up, April 2018), and in an individual-level RCT at 7 sites in Lima, Peru (N=432; from January 2017 to September 2017; final follow-up, March 2018). Interventions An 18-session, low-intensity, digital intervention was delivered over 6 weeks via a provided smartphone, based on behavioral activation principles, and supported by nurse assistants (n = 440 participants in 10 clusters in São Paulo; n = 217 participants in Lima) vs enhanced usual care (n = 440 participants in 10 clusters in São Paulo; n = 215 participants in Lima). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was a reduction of at least 50% from baseline in PHQ-9 scores (range, 0-27; higher score indicates more severe depression) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included a reduction of at least 50% from baseline PHQ-9 scores at 6 months. Results Among 880 patients cluster randomized in Brazil (mean age, 56.0 years; 761 [86.5%] women) and 432 patients individually randomized in Peru (mean age, 59.7 years; 352 [81.5%] women), 807 (91.7%) in Brazil and 426 (98.6%) in Peru completed at least 1 follow-up assessment. The proportion of participants in São Paulo with a reduction in PHQ-9 score of at least 50% at 3-month follow-up was 40.7% (159/391 participants) in the digital intervention group vs 28.6% (114/399 participants) in the enhanced usual care group (difference, 12.1 percentage points [95% CI, 5.5 to 18.7]; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.6 [95% CI, 1.2 to 2.2]; P = .001). In Lima, the proportion of participants with a reduction in PHQ-9 score of at least 50% at 3-month follow-up was 52.7% (108/205 participants) in the digital intervention group vs 34.1% (70/205 participants) in the enhanced usual care group (difference, 18.6 percentage points [95% CI, 9.1 to 28.0]; adjusted OR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.4 to 3.2]; P < .001). At 6-month follow-up, differences across groups were no longer statistically significant. Conclusions and Relevance In 2 RCTs of patients with hypertension or diabetes and depressive symptoms in Brazil and Peru, a digital intervention delivered over a 6-week period significantly improved depressive symptoms at 3 months when compared with enhanced usual care. However, the magnitude of the effect was small in the trial from Brazil and the effects were not sustained at 6 months.

This study examined whether emotional disorder symptoms and transdiagnostic vulnerabilities during adolescence predicted young adult substance use during COVID-19, and whether using substances to cope with the pandemic's social conditions mediated these associations. Adolescents (N = 2,120) completed baseline surveys assessing transdiagnostic emotional vulnerabilities (anhedonia, distress intolerance, anxiety sensitivity, negative urgency) and symptoms (major depression[MD], generalized anxiety[GAD], panic disorder[PD], social phobia[SP], obsessive-compulsive disorder[OCD]) in adolescence (September-December 2016; M[SD] age = 17.45[0.38]). At follow-up (May-August 2020; M[SD] age = 21.16[0.39]), past 30-day substance use and using substances to cope with social isolation during the pandemic were reported. Adjusted models showed that baseline distress intolerance, anxiety sensitivity, negative urgency, and MD symptoms each significantly predicted higher number of past-month single-substance using days and number of substances used at follow-up (βs = 0.04-0.06).

Here, we report on the critical role of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in discovering the mechanism of allosteric communication within CRISPR-Cas9, a leading genome editing machinery with enormous promises for medicine and biotechnology. MD revealed how allostery intervenes during at least three steps of the CRISPR-Cas9 function: affecting DNA recognition, mediating the cleavage and interfering with the off-target activity. An allosteric communication that activates concerted DNA cleavages was found to led through the L1/L2 loops, which connect the HNH and RuvC catalytic domains. The identification of these ""allosteric transducers"" inspired the development of novel variants of the Cas9 protein with improved specificity, opening a new avenue for controlling the CRISPR-Cas9 activity. Discussed studies also highlight the critical role of the recognition lobe in the conformational activation of the catalytic HNH domain. Specifically, the REC3 region was found to modulate the dynamics of HNH by sensing the formation of the RNA:DNA hybrid. The role of REC3 was revealed to be particularly relevant in the presence of DNA mismatches. Indeed, interference of REC3 with the RNA:DNA hybrid containing mismatched pairs at specific positions resulted in locking HNH in an inactive ""conformational checkpoint"" conformation, thereby hampering off-target cleavages. Overall, MD simulations established the fundamental mechanisms underlying the allosterism of CRISPR-Cas9, aiding engineering strategies to develop new CRISPR-Cas9 variants for improved genome editing.","Nierzwicki, Łukasz; Arantes, Pablo Ricardo; Saha, Aakash; Palermo, Giulia",Wiley interdisciplinary reviews.

The question no longer appears to be whether performative methods have a place within history and philosophy of science research, but what their place is, could, or should be; when and how they can and cannot be used. Because although performative methods are seen as an enrichment of the field by many, their growing popularity also raises questions: what new insights and challenges has the increased use of performative methods in the history of science brought us? How has it changed the field? Should performative research methods become a mandatory part of the training of new generations of historians of science?

Although the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) pandemic disrupted medical education globally, ophthalmic educators rapidly transformed their curricula to novel and effective virtual learning formats. Thus, while the COVID-19 outbreak has been one of the most significant challenges faced in the history of medical education, it has also provided an impetus to develop innovative teaching practices, bringing with it unprecedented success in allowing medical students to continue their education in ophthalmology despite these challenges. We review and appraise novel educational interventions implemented by various institutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting their effectiveness, challenges and proposing future directions beyond the pandemic. Many of these innovations will persist even after the end of the pandemic because they have proven that face-to-face learning is not required for all aspects of the ophthalmic GME curriculum. As ophthalmic educators harness the power of educational technology it is critical that their novel educational initiatives are incorporated into competency-based curricula with assessments mapped to the competencies. Future research should focus on evaluating the impact of this transformation to virtual learning environments on student performances as well as implementing longitudinal assessment strategies for clinical competence in workplace-based practice.","Succar, Tony; Beaver, Hilary A; Lee, Andrew G",Survey of ophthalmology,216,24

Therefore, this study investigated the influence of inspiratory muscle-loaded exercise training (IMLET) on peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), respiratory responses, and exercise performance under normoxic (N) and hypoxic (H) exercise conditions. We hypothesised that IMLET enhances respiratory muscle strength and improves respiratory response, thereby improving VO2peak and work capacity under H condition. Methods Sixteen university track runners (13 men and 3 women) were randomly assigned to the IMLET (n = 8) or exercise training (ET) group (n = 8). All subjects underwent 4 weeks of 20-min 60% VO2peak cycling exercise training, thrice per week. IMLET loaded 50% of maximal inspiratory pressure during exercise. At pre- and post-training periods, subjects performed exhaustive incremental cycling under normoxic (N; 20.9 ± 0%) and hypoxic (H; 15.0 ± 0.1%) conditions. Results Although maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) significantly increased after training in both groups, the extent of PImax increase was significantly higher in the IMLET group (from 102 ± 20 to 145 ± 26 cmH2O in IMLET; from 111 ± 23 to 127 ± 23 cmH2O in ET; P < 0.05). In both groups, VO2peak and maximal work load (Wmax) similarly increased both under N and H conditions after training (P < 0.05). Further, the extent of Wmax decrease under H condition was lower in the IMLET group at post-training test than at pre-training (from - 14.7 ± 2.2% to - 12.5 ± 1.7%; P < 0.05). Maximal minute ventilation in both N and H conditions increased after training than in the pre-training period. Conclusions Our IMLET enhanced the respiratory muscle strength, and the decrease in work capacity under hypoxia was reduced regardless of the increase in VO2peak.","Ogawa, Takeshi; Nagao, Maiko; Fujii, Naoto; Nishiyasu, Takeshi","BMC sports science, medicine & rehabilitation",216,1

Due to the crucial health role, a face mask now is a safety device that helps protect the wearer from breathing in hazardous particles such as bacteria and viruses in the air; thus exhaled breath is also blocked to congregate in the small space inside of the face mask. Therefore, direct sampling and analysis of trace constituents in EBA using a face mask can rapidly provide useful insights into human physiologic and pathological information. Herein, we introduce a simple approach to collect and analyze human EBA by combining a face mask with solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber. SPME fiber was inserted into a face mask to form SPME-in-mask that covered nose and mouth for in vivo sampling of EBA, and SPME fiber was then coupled with direct analysis in real-time mass spectrometry (DART-MS) to directly analyze the molecular compositions of EBA under ambient conditions. The applicability of SPME-in-mask was demonstrated by direct analysis of drugs and metabolites in oral and nasal EBA. The unique features of SPME-in-mask were also discussed. Our results showed that this method is enabled to analyze volatile and nonvolatile analytes in EBA and is expected to have a significant impact on human EBA analysis in clinical applications. We also hope this method will inspire biomarker screening of some respiratory diseases that usually required wearing of a face mask in daily life.","Yuan, Zi-Cheng; Li, Wen; Wu, Lin; Huang, Dou; Wu, Manman; Hu, Bin",Analytical chemistry,216,17

METHODS In this retrospective single center study, patients who showed typical findings suggestive of RCC on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and underwent relevant ophthalmic examination were recruited retrospectively. Patients were stratified into two groups according to the presence or absence of ophthalmic symptoms related to RCC. We reviewed patients' demographic information, initial symptoms, endocrinological status, ophthalmic features, and characteristics on MRI. Height, size and location of RCC, as well as the optic chiasm displacement assessed from magnetic resonance images. RESULTS Thirty-three patients (20 women and 13 men) were included in this study from among 335 patients with RCC on MRI. Fifteen patients had ophthalmic manifestation related to the cyst (Ophthalmic group), whereas 18 patients were not (Non-ophthalmic group). Headache was the most common initial symptom (15 patients, 45.5%), followed by visual disturbance (7, 21.2%), diplopia (1, 3.0%), retro-orbital pain (1, 3.0%), galactorrhea (1, 3.0%), and peripheral extremity discomfort (1, 3.0%). In 7 asymptomatic patients (21.2%), the lesion was an incidental finding during regular medical examination. Ophthalmic manifestation included visual field defect (14 patients, 93.3%) and diplopia (1 patient, 6.7%). The height, volume, and the coronal and sagittal displacements were larger in the ophthalmic group (P<0.001, all). Eleven patients who manifested ophthalmic symptoms underwent excision surgeries and 9 of them (81.8%) experienced visual function improvement.

Our objective was to describe our technique and assess the outcomes of our approach to hand-assisted laparoscopic retroperitoneal donor nephrectomies. METHODS From July 2001 to October 2015, 507 consecutive hand-assisted laparoscopic retroperitoneal donor nephrectomies were performed. Their clinical information was retrospectively reviewed including warm ischemia time, skin incision to kidney ready time, estimated blood loss, adverse intraoperative events, and postoperative complications. RESULTS Mean incision time to kidney removal was 135 minutes (55-260), mean warm ischemia time was 125 seconds (30-390), and mean blood loss was 83 mL (20-500). Average length of stay was 3 days (1-6). There were no significant differences between left and right kidney donors based on demographics, length of hospital stay, or warm ischemia time. There were no conversions to open surgery. Complications occurred in 4.9% of patients (25/507), including 4 cases of perioperative bleeding. CONCLUSIONS This is a single-center series describing the safety and efficacy of the hand-assisted laparoscopic retroperitoneal donor nephrectomy for both right and left sides.

The contralateral eye was the control. Injectate distribution was evaluated with CT. After atipamezole administration, periocular and corneal sensations, intraocular pressure (IOP), and ocular reflexes and appearance were evaluated for 24 hours. RESULTS All peribulbar and 3 of 6 retrobulbar injections resulted in CT evidence of intraconal injectate. Corneal sensation and periocular skin sensation were absent or significantly reduced relative to that for control eyes for 3 hours after peribulbar injection. Mean ± SD IOP immediately after injection was significantly higher for eyes with peribulbar injections (33 ± 12 mm Hg) than for control eyes or eyes with retrobulbar injections (both 14 ± 4 mm Hg) but 10 minutes later decreased to 18 ± 3 mm Hg. Exophthalmos, chemosis, and ptosis were evident in most injected eyes, and irritation was evident in 3 of 6 peribulbar-injected and 1 of 6 retrobulbar-injected eyes. All conditions resolved within 14 hours.

AIMS The integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of sevoflurane in both adults and children was reviewed using compartment models. We wished to delineate age-related changes in both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. METHODS The bispectral index and sevoflurane endtidal concentration were continuously measured in 50 patients, aged 3-71 years, scheduled for minor surgery. During maintenance of anesthesia and after stable bispectral index values of 60-65 were obtained, the inspired concentration of sevoflurane was increased to 5 vol % for 5 minutes or until BIS 40 and then decreased. Data were analyzed using mammillary compartments with nonlinear mixed effects population modeling. The covariate effects of age and size were investigated. RESULTS A three-compartment PK model adequately described sevoflurane pharmacokinetics. Size standardization using allometry explained clearance and volume changes with age. The equilibration half-time (1.48 minutes) increased with age, but could be predicted using allometry in those under 40 years.

In this study, we investigated the viral virulence determinants by constructing a series of chimeric mutants between the highly virulent strain BJ2011C and the avirulent strain CHM2013. When tested in the 2-day-old piglet model, wild-type (WT) BJ2011C caused severe diarrhea and death of the piglets within 72 h. In contrast, its chimeric derivative carrying the S gene from CHM2013 (BJ2011C-SCHM) was avirulent to the piglets. Moreover, reciprocal substitution of the BJ2011C S gene (CHM2013-SBJ) did not enable CHM2013 to gain any virulence. However, when the whole structural protein-coding region of BJ2011C (CHM2013-SPBJ) was swapped, CHM2013 started to gain the ability to efficiently colonize the intestinal tract and caused diarrhea in piglets. A further gain of virulence required additional acquisition of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of BJ2011C, and the resultant virus (CHM2013-SP + 3UTRBJ) caused more severe diarrhea and death of piglets. Together, our findings suggest that the virulence of PEDV epidemic strains is a multigenic event and that the S gene is only one of the necessary determinants.IMPORTANCE The recently emerged highly virulent PEDV variants are the major cause of the global porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) pandemic. The S gene of the variants undergoes remarkable variations and has been thought to be the virulence determinant for the enhanced pathogenesis. Our studies here showed that the S gene is only part of the story and that full virulence requires cooperation from other genes. Our findings provide insight into the pathogenic mechanism of the highly virulent PEDV variants and have implications for future vaccine development.","Wang, Di; Ge, Xinna; Chen, Dongjie; Li, Jie; Cai, Yueqi; Deng, Jin; Zhou, Lei; Guo, Xin; Han, Jun; Yang, Hanchun",Journal of virology,216,1

Coronary heart disease (OR, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.11-3.24], p=0.020), and ICU admission (OR, 2.47 [95% CI, 1.31-4.66], p=0.005) were independent risk factors associated with viral RNA shedding after IgG detection. CONCLUSION Symptomatic patients produced more antibodies than asymptomatic patients. The patients who had SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding after developing IgG were more likely to be sicker patients.

We provide evidence on how emergency department (ED) visits for substance use disorders (SUD) changed in the early pandemic period. METHODS Using retrospective data from January-July 2020 compared to January-July 2019, we calculated weekly 2020/2019 visit ratios for opioid-related, alcohol-related, other drug-related disorders, and all non-COVID-19 visits. We assess how this ratio as well as overall visit numbers changed after the mid-March 2020 onset of general pandemic restrictions. RESULTS In 4.5 million ED visits in 2020 and 2019 to 108 EDs in 18 U.S. states, SUD visits were higher in early 2020 compared to 2019. During the peak-pandemic restriction period (March 13-July 31), non-COVID-19, non-SUD visits fell by approximately 45% early on, and then partly recovered with an average decline of 33% relative to 2019 levels. Visits for opioid-related, alcohol-related, and other drug-related disorders also declined, although less sharply, with an average drop of 17%, which was similar across SUD types. The visit ratios for 2020/2019 partially or fully recovered later in our sample period, depending on SUD type, but did not exceed early-2020 levels. However, substantial variation occurred across SUD types and across states. SUD visit declines were most prominent in the 65+ age group, except for alcohol-related visits where trends were similar across ages. SUD visits arriving by ambulance declined less or increased relative to self-transport visits, and ED deaths were rare. CONCLUSIONS The 2020/2019 ratios of SUD ED visits fell substantially early in the COVID-19 pandemic, yet less than non-SUD, non-COVID ED visits. SUD ED visit ratios partly or fully recovered to 2019 levels by early June 2020, but did not exceed early 2020 ratios.","Pines, Jesse M; Zocchi, Mark S; Black, Bernard S; Carlson, Jestin N; Celedon, Pablo; Moghtaderi, Ali; Venkat, Arvind",Journal of substance abuse treatment,216,1

The feasibility of an adequate molecular testing from these specimens has been very little studied. Methods We retrospectively reviewed EMN and rEBUS procedures performed in patients diagnosed with lung cancer in our institution in 2017 and 2018. We analysed the sensitivity for rEBUS and EMN and each sampling method, and the feasibility of a comprehensive molecular testing. Results In total, 317 rEBUS and 14 EMN were performed. Median sizes of tumours were 16 and 32 mm for EMN and rEBUS, respectively. Overall sensitivity for rEBUS and EMN was 84.3%. Cytology was found to be complementary with biopsies, with 13.3% of cancer diagnosed on cytology while biopsies were negative. Complication rate was 2.4% (pneumothorax 1.5%, mild haemoptysis 0.9%). Genotyping (immunohistochemistry for ROS1 and ALK followed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation if positive and hybrid capture next-generation sequencing covering 48 genes), when ordered (n=188), was feasible in 69.1% (EGFR 17.7%, KRAS 31.7%, BRAF 4.8%, ALK 1.2%, MET 3.1%, HER2 0.8%). PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) expression, when ordered (n=232), could be analysed in 94% of cases. Overall, 56.9% (33 out of 58) of patients for whom genotyping was not feasible underwent a second sampling (12 pretreatment, 21 at progression), allowing for the detection of six actionable genotypes (five EGFR, one MET). Conclusion rEBUS and EMN are sensitive and safe procedures that result in limited samples, often not suitable for genotyping, highlighting the importance of integrating liquid biopsy in routine testing.","Robin, Maxime; Mhanna, Laurent; Chaltiel, Leonor; Plat, Gavin; Héluain, Valentin; Basset, Céline; Meilleroux, Julie; Filleron, Thomas; Mazières, Julien; Hermant, Christophe; Guibert, Nicolas",ERJ open research,216,26

The focus of these policies is on screening and surveillance of immigrants rather than addressing social inequalities underlying the problem of immigrant tuberculosis. The biomedical focus and racializing character of current policies were reinforced in the Canadian press by depicting tuberculosis as a biomedical (rather than a social) disease imported to Canada by immigrants. The status of the immigrant body as health threat was produced by and through preexisting and mutually constitutive racializing and medicalizing discourses materialized in press coverage and tuberculosis control policies. Deracialization and demedicalization of health information disseminated in the press are potentially important factors to be considered when revising health policies that would address the socioeconomic and political factors that determine the health status of Canadian immigrants.","Reitmanova, Sylvia; Gustafson, Diana L",Qualitative health research,216,6

The ACE2 gene is expressed in SARS-CoV-2 target cells, including Type II Pneumocytes (Ziegler, 2020), and is activated by interferons. Viral RNA was also detected in breast milk (Wu et al., 2020), raising the possibility that ACE2 expression is under the control of cytokines through the JAK-STAT pathway. Here we show that Ace2 expression in mammary tissue is induced during pregnancy and lactation, which coincides with the establishment of a candidate enhancer. The prolactin-activated transcription factor STAT5 binds to tandem sites that coincide with activating histone enhancer marks and additional transcription components. The presence of pan JAK-STAT components in mammary alveolar cells and in Type II Pneumocytes combined with the autoregulation of both STAT1 and STAT5 suggests a prominent role of cytokine signaling pathways in cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2.

Because PutAs catalyze sequential reactions, they are good systems for studying how metabolic enzymes communicate via substrate channeling. Although mechanistically similar, PutAs vary widely in domain architecture, oligomeric state, and quaternary structure, and these variations represent different structural solutions to the problem of sequestering a reactive metabolite. Here, we studied PutA from Corynebacterium freiburgense (CfPutA), which belongs to the uncharacterized 3B class of PutAs. A 2.7 Å resolution crystal structure showed the canonical arrangement of PRODH, l-glutamate-γ-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, and C-terminal domains, including an extended interdomain tunnel associated with substrate channeling. The structure unexpectedly revealed a novel open conformation of the PRODH active site, which is interpreted to represent the non-activated conformation, an elusive form of PutA that exhibits suboptimal channeling. Nevertheless, CfPutA exhibited normal substrate-channeling activity, indicating that it isomerizes into the active state under assay conditions. Sedimentation-velocity experiments provided insight into the isomerization process, showing that CfPutA dimerizes in the presence of a proline analog and NAD+ These results are consistent with the morpheein model of enzyme hysteresis, in which substrate binding induces conformational changes that promote assembly of a high-activity oligomer. Finally, we used domain deletion analysis to investigate the function of the C-terminal domain. Although this domain contains neither catalytic residues nor substrate sites, its removal impaired both catalytic activities, suggesting that it may be essential for active-site integrity.","Korasick, David A; Gamage, Thameesha T; Christgen, Shelbi; Stiers, Kyle M; Beamer, Lesa J; Henzl, Michael T; Becker, Donald F; Tanner, John J",The Journal of biological chemistry,216,12

Furthermore, it is aimed to investigate these parameters compliance with dose-volume histograms (DVH) parameters. Materials and Methods Ten T1GL patients were immobilized in a supine position with a head and neck thermoplastic mask. Treatment plans were created with opposed lateral fields (OLAFs) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) techniques with a total dose of 66 Gy in 33 fraction with 2 Gy/day. IMRT fields were selected as five fields (5IMRT) and seven fields (7IMRT). Dosimetric evaluation of three different treatment plans for T1GL carcinoma was performed in two consequential steps. First step was the assessment of planning target volume (PTV), all organs at risks (OARs), and normal tissue (NT) dose calculations according to given dose constraint directions and comparing the plans via DVH. In the second step, for PTV, the compatibility of DVH data with CIs-TCP was investigated where COSI-NTCP was compared with DVH for OARs. The DVH data were considered as reference in all evaluations. Results The CIRTOG mean values were significantly closer to 1 with IMRT plans when compared to OLAF plans (P = 0.005). The CIPADDICK mean values revealed that OLAF plans were significantly worse than IMRT plans (P = 0.005). No statistically significant difference was found between all three plans in terms of homogeneity index mean values (P = 0.076). The calculated mean TCP values were significantly better for 7IMRT plans when compared to OLAF and 5IMRT plans (P = 0.007 and P = 0.017, respectively). Both NTCP and COSI evaluations, which is compatible with DVH, significantly favored OLAF plan for spinal cord and 7IMRT for thyroid gland. The COSI evaluations, which are compatible with DVH, significantly favored 7IMRT plan for carotid arteries and 5IMRT plan for NT. Conclusion Our results demonstrated that CIPADDICK-TCP calculations for PTV and COSI-NTCP calculations for OARs were compatible with DVH in T1 GL plans. Therefore, we suggest such parameters as valuable tools for choosing the feasible one among multiple plans and even with different treatment machines.","Inal, Aysun; Duman, Evrim; Ozkan, Elif E",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,216,19

In this study, the effects of cur C086 combined with cisplatin on the biological processes of osteosarcoma cells were investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, expression of BMIL1 was detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting in MG-63 cells treated with cur C086+cisplatin. Functions of cur C086+cisplatin on proliferation ability, apoptosis response, and metastatic potential of MG-63 cells were determined by MTT, flow cytometry, Hoechst 33258 staining and Transwell assays, respectively. In additionally, expression of P16, E-cadherin, epidermal growth factor (EGFR), and Notch1 was measured by Western blotting. RESULTS Expression of BMIL1 decreased significantly in MG-63 cells treated with cur C086 (20 µM)+cisplatin (1.28 nM). Treatment with cur C086+cisplatin considerably inhibited growth, migration, and invasion potential in MG-63 cells, whereas apoptosis was obviously upregulated. Moreover, cur C086+cisplatin suppressed BMIL1 expression or its potential downstream targets, P16, E-cadherin, EGFR, and Notch1.

A review of recent studies may reveal more information on challenges in reestablishing social roles. METHOD The aim was to provide an updated systematic review on social participation in PWA under 65 years of age. Studies from 2005 to 2017 were searched from Scopus, Pubmed, and Psychinfo. Search terms were derived from the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and the Aphasia- Framework for Outcomes Measures (A-FROM). Aspects of domestic life, interpersonal relations and interactions, education and employment, and community, civic, and social life were investigated. RESULTS From 2864 initial hits, 11 studies were identified, all of which were on the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Level III of evidence. The studies indicated that participation in domestic life is reduced and PWA showed reduced social networks, loss of friendships and changes in the quality of marital relations. Few PWA returned to work or spent time on education. Limitations in community, civic, and social life were noted and there were contradictory findings on the impact of contextual factors on social participation. There was an increase in research into contextual factors impacting on social participation in PWA and in the use of conceptual frameworks in the last decade. CONCLUSIONS While the ICF conceptual framework is increasingly used, no studies used the A-FROM. There is greater use of standardized assessments and larger sample sizes.","Pike, Caitlin; Kritzinger, Alta; Pillay, Bhavani",Topics in stroke rehabilitation,216,1

We hypothesized that the cross-talk between macrophages and adipose tissue-derived MSCs (ASCs) is biomaterial dependent, thereby influencing processes involved in wound healing. MATERIALS AND METHODS The effect of macrophages cultured on polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene terephthalate coated with a collagen film (PET/Col) on ASCs in monolayer or on the same material was examined either through conditioned medium (CM) or in a direct coculture. ASC proliferation, collagen production, and gene expression were examined. As comparison, the effect of macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon gamma (IFNγ) [M(LPS/IFNγ)] or interleukin (IL) 4 [M(IL-4)] on ASCs was examined. RESULTS Macrophage-CM increased collagen deposition, proliferation, and gene expression of MMP1, PLOD2, and PTGS2 in ASCs, irrespective of the material. Culturing ASCs and macrophages in coculture when only macrophages were on the materials induced the same effects on gene expression. When both ASCs and macrophages were cultured on biomaterials, PP induced COL1A1 and MMP1 more than PET/Col. M(LPS/IFNγ) CM increased PLOD2, MMP1, and PTGS2 and decreased TGFB in ASCs more than the M(IL-4) CM. CONCLUSION Biomaterials influence wound healing by influencing the interaction between macrophages and ASCs. We provided more insight into the behavior of different cell types during wound healing. This behavior appears to be biomaterial specific depending on which cell type interacts with the biomaterial. As such, the biomaterial will influence tissue regeneration.","Grotenhuis, Nienke; De Witte, Samantha F H; van Osch, Gerjo J V M; Bayon, Yves; Lange, Johan F; Bastiaansen-Jenniskens, Yvonne M",Tissue engineering.

Counts of these sequences convey information regarding the occurrence and relative abundances of taxa, but provide no direct measure of their absolute abundances, due to the technical limitations of the sequencing process. The relative abundances in compositional data are inherently constrained and difficult to interpret. The incorporation of internal standards (ISDs; colloquially referred to as ""spike-ins"") into DNA pools can ameliorate the problems posed by relative abundance data and allow absolute abundances to be approximated. Unfortunately, many laboratory and sampling biases cause ISDs to underperform or fail. Here, we discuss how careful deployment of ISDs can avoid these complications and be an integral component of well-designed studies seeking to characterize ecological assemblages via sequencing of DNA.","Harrison, Joshua G; Calder, W John; Shuman, Bryan; Buerkle, C Alex",Molecular ecology resources,216,1

At the same time, a high level of blood safety must be guaranteed and different guidelines (GLs) deal with this topic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the appropriateness of different GLs in preventing transfusion-transmissible infections (TTI) in Italian feline blood donors. Methods Blood samples were collected from 31 cats enrolled as blood donors by the owners' voluntary choice over a period of approximately 1 year. Possible risk factors for TTI were recorded. Based on Italian, European and American GLs, specific TTI, including haemoplasmas, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia species, Bartonella species, Babesia species, Theileria species, Cytauxzoon species, Leishmania donovani sensu lato and feline coronavirus (FCoV), were screened. Rapid antigen and serological tests and biomolecular investigations (PCR) were used. Several PCR protocols for haemoplasma and FeLV DNA were compared. Results The presence of at least one recognised risk factor for TTI was reported in all cats. Results for FIV and FeLV infections were negative using rapid tests, whereas five (16.1%) cats were positive for FCoV antibodies. Four (12.9%) cats were PCR positive for haemoplasma DNA and one (3.2%) for FeLV provirus, the latter being positive only using the most sensitive PCR protocol applied. Other TTI were not detected using PCR. Conclusions and relevance Blood safety increases by combining the recommendations of different GLs. To reduce the risk of TTI, sensitive tests are needed and the choice of the best protocol is a critical step in improving blood safety. The cost and time of the screening procedures may be reduced if appropriate tests are selected. To this end, the GLs should include appropriate recruitment protocols and questionnaire-based risk profiles to identify suitable donors.","Marenzoni, Maria Luisa; Lauzi, Stefania; Miglio, Arianna; Coletti, Mauro; Arbia, Andrea; Paltrinieri, Saverio; Antognoni, Maria Teresa",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,216,22

Being highly transmissible, this novel coronavirus disease has spread fast all over the world. COVID-19 continues to challenge most developed countries in the search for an effective strategy to either prevent infection or to avoid the spreading of the disease. While several developed countries have managed to contain COVID-19, several countries in Latin America continue to report an increase in the daily number of infected people. Ecuador, particularly, became the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the region during March and April 2020. In this context, the present study shows a simple mathematical approach to understand the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak in Ecuador (and some Latin American countries such as Brazil, Peru, and Colombia). The proposed method is based on the exponential model, discrete logistic equation, and differential logistic model using one-year data from March 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021. This study presents the estimated growth rate coefficient (λ), the total number of cases (N), and the midpoint of maximum infection (t_0) as well as the variability of the λ coefficient as a function of total cases and time. The exponential model shows a high value of λ=0.185 which decreases to λ=0.014 and λ=0.056 according to the discrete and differential logistic models, respectively. An accurate value of the total number of cases of infected people was found by analyzing the number of daily cases as a function of the total of cases whose value (N~409 K) agrees with the data reported at the end of May 2021, validating the proposed approach. How to use the current mathematical approach for long-term prediction is also discussed here. Most importantly, the proposed method has two important characteristics: (i) the mathematical model is as simple as possible compared to other time-consuming approaches, and (ii) it can be used to study the effect of COVID-19 and predicts its consequences in other countries, allowing revenue new decisions against the COVID-19 disease. © 2021 by the authors.

The extent of its impact on the global economy and its key sectors, especially water, wastewater, and associated sectors such as agriculture, is still unclear. In this paper, the preliminary impacts of COVID-19 on water resources of India, especially on the river water quality, water usage in domestic and commercial sectors, wastewater treatment sector, and agriculture sector, are discussed. The limitations in the functioning of the existing system and management of water resources are identified. The need for improvements to strengthen the water resources monitoring and developing process-based models are highlighted. This paper also discusses the need for further investigation to identify the extent of impact and contributing factors to improve our understanding of the natural system for preparing, monitoring, and implementing the policies to manage the water resources during any pandemic/epidemics in the future.","Balamurugan, M.; Kasiviswanathan, K.

Gram-positive bacteria contribute to severe pneumonia associated with COVID-19, and their resistance to antibiotics is increasing at an alarming rate. In this regard, non-woven fabrics are currently used for the fabrication of infection prevention clothing such as face masks, caps, scrubs, shirts, trousers, disposable gowns, overalls, hoods, aprons and shoe covers as protective tools against viral and bacterial infections. However, these non-woven fabrics are made of materials that do not possess antimicrobial activity. Thus, we have developed here non-woven fabrics with antimicrobial coatings of cranberry extracts capable of inactivating enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and the phage phi 6, and two multidrug-resistant bacteria: the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The non-toxicity of these advanced technology was ensured using a Caenorhabditis elegans in vivo model.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the retraction status and reasons of non-Cochrane SRs in the field of medicine. Methods: We searched MEDLINE and Embase from their inception to April 18, 2020, as well as Retraction Watch Database and Google Scholar with no language restriction to find non-Cochrane SRs that were retracted for any reason. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data. We describe the characteristic and reasons of retraction and the duration from publication to retraction. Results: We identified 150 non-Cochrane SRs in medicine retracted between 2004 and 2020. The majority of retracted SRs were led by authors from China and affiliated with hospitals. Most SRs were published in journals with an impact factor [≤]3, and in journal ranked in the third quarter. The largest proportion of retraction notices were issued by the publisher and editor(s) jointly; seven did not report this information. Fraudulent peer-review was the most common reason for retraction, followed by unreliable data meaning errors in study selection or data analysis. The median time between publication and retraction was 14.0 months. SRs retracted due to research misconduct took longer to retract than SRs retracted because of honest error. Conclusions: The situation with retracted SRs is critical globally, and in particular in China. The most common reasons for retraction are fraudulent peer-review and unreliable data, and in most cases the study is retracted more than a year after publication. Efforts should be made to improve the process of peer review and adherence to the COPE retraction guidance, while at the same time authors should strengthen their skills in SR methodology.

Preliminary Results,15.773675,9.289088,2020,"Under the influence of COVID-19, online learning has become the primary way for students to continue their education. At all stages of online learning, active learning is a useful strategy promoting optimal understanding. However, there is a lack of relevant research on how to evaluate students’ active learning performance. This paper presents an online active learning assessment framework based on the learning pyramid and learning dimension theory. After the division of course modules according to the learning pyramid theory, the active learning assessment is performed from five dimensions: (1) positive attitudes and perceptions about learning;(2) acquiring and integrating knowledge;(3) extending and refining knowledge;(4) using knowledge meaningfully, and (5) productive habits of mind. By identifying patterns from each online course module’s weblog data, instructors can assess students’ active learning conveniently from the beginning to the end of the online course. This study helps instructors understand learners’ learning situations and adopt corresponding strategies to adjust teaching activities to ensure high-quality teaching activities. Simultaneously, learners can also actively change their learning status according to active learning assessment to improve the learning effect. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Liu, C.; Zou, D.; Chan, W.

Though most Papua New Guineans see the virus as harmful, the comparatively few numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Papua New Guinea have led many to feel they have been spared the horror and trauma that other countries have endured. In this chapter, I use Foucault’s notion of heterotopia to discuss Melanesian reactions to the pandemic. I argue that heterotopia must be configured to fit within the local context to understand local conceptualizations of COVID-19.

We predicted that particularly descriptive social norms are important in driving pandemic-related behavior as they offer guidelines in times of insecurity and crisis. To investigate this assumption, we conducted a longitudinal survey with two measurement points (n = 1,907) in Germany during the spring of 2020. Results show that descriptive norms (perceived behavior of close others) positively predicted future transgression against distancing regulations, stockpiling, and prosocial behavior over time. In our analysis, we account for previous behavior as well as other potential predictors (subjective threat, personality). In sum, our findings highlight the power of descriptive norms in increasing compliance with pandemic-related regulations and promoting future prosocial behavior.

The COVID-19 pandemic presented multiple challenges: a novel disease alongside staff with little experience of managing acute medical needs for complex psychiatric patients, staff’s risk of contracting or transmitting COVID, utilising staff working from home and decision making reflecting new research.MethodA twice daily virtual medical ward round was piloted using Microsoft Teams to provide medical leadership in the management of COVID-related patients for 5 separate clinical teams working in the unit.This also allowed staff working from home to be involved, information to be shared and communication improved with all involved. It further ensured that clinicians’ time was spent more efficiently and minimised the risk of people moving between wards. Feedback was sought throughout and the ward round was adapted accordingly. Post-ward round feedback was sought by distributing a questionnaire to those directly involved. The questionnaire comprised nine questions comparing ‘before’ and ‘after’ the ward rounds were implemented.ResultsResults showed a considerable improvement following the ward round. Staff felt more prepared, more confident, reassured with decision making, better informed and witnessed improved team working and clear leadership. In addition staff spent less time on the ward, therefore reducing the risk of contracting/transmitting COVID. Problems, including poor internet connection, better communication to ward staff and discussion of un-related issues were resolved.ConclusionsThis project shows how IT can be utilised to provide leadership and help manage new problems. It enabled staff working from home to support patients/colleagues, supported colleagues on the ward and contributed to staff wellbeing in a particularly challenging time.","Beyers, Cornelia Tarrant Nick Indraneal Ray",BMJ Leader,216,7

Design: Cross-sectional survey. Participants: 8th wave of the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (2016/17), stratified by age (n=1,635 aged <65; n=4,123 aged 65+). Methods: Inverse probability weighted estimation of average effects of weekly in-person and remote social contact on depression (score of 3+ on 8-item CES-D scale) and two measures of loneliness (sometimes/often feels lonely vs hardly ever/never; and top quintile of UCLA loneliness scale vs all others). We also estimated controlled direct effects of education, partner status, and wealth on loneliness and depression under two scenarios: 1) universal infrequent (<weekly) in-person social contact; and 2) universal weekly remote social contact. Results: Weekly in-person social contact was associated with reduced odds of depression and loneliness, but associations with remote social contact were weak. Lower education raised odds of depression and loneliness, but differences were attenuated with infrequent in-person contact. Respondents living alone experienced more depression and loneliness than those living with a partner, and less wealth was associated with more depression. With universal infrequent in-person contact, differences narrowed among those aged under 65 but widened among those aged 65+. Universal weekly remote contact had little impact on inequalities. Conclusions: Reduced in-person social contact may increase depression and loneliness among older adults, especially for those aged 65+ who live alone. Reliance on remote social contact seems unlikely to compensate for social inequalities.","Green, M. J.; Whitley, E.; Niedzwiedz, C. L.; Shaw, R. J.; Katikireddi, S. V.",,216,16

The authors used the correlation-regression dependence of the number of tourists going abroad Y on the income of the population X and Fisher's statistical criterion to check the model's adequacy. Authors proposed the system for ensuring sustainable development and competitiveness of the hotel, restaurant and tourism business. The peculiarity of the proposed system is that it covers all aspects of sustainable development, includes multi-level governing bodies, integrable legal forms of organizations and science, making it possible to form interrelated elements of sustainable development and increase the competitiveness of the hotel and hotel industry, tourism in general. In years of political instability, the number of domestic tourists, with a positive upward trend, is falling sharply, despite rising incomes. Fisher's statistical criterion indicates this model's adequacy: An increase in income of the entire population of Ukraine by UAH 10 mln. would lead to the additional appearance of about 8 Ukrainian tourists travelling abroad. The coefficient of elasticity Ex (Y) = 0.9193 shows that an increase in the income of the entire population of Ukraine by 1% would increase the flow of Ukrainian tourists travelling abroad by about 0.9%. The article is devoted to the search for ways to increase the competitiveness of the hotel and restaurant and tourism business. The analysis showed that 2019 was a good year for the entire HRTB. However, the global pandemic COVID-19 in 2020 significantly affected this area: Border closures, cancellation of messages between countries, total quarantine, weekend quarantine and other prohibitions. Therefore, the search for a strategy to increase the competitiveness of HRTB facilities in 2020/2021 is the most relevant.

An online survey, with questions informed by a literature survey, was sent to library and information science professionals in Nigeria with WhatsApp accounts (individual and library and information science group accounts). The responses were automatically collected and saved into Google Sheets for further analysis using descriptive statistics. There were 167 responses (61% response rate). The main information needs were causes of the virus, COVID-19 symptoms, providing library services during physical library closure, the timing of reopening, and staff and user safety measures required for library reopening. The respondents were also concerned about COVID-19 test procedures and transmission mechanisms, treatment (including herbal medicines), vaccines, government policy and restrictions on movement. The main information sources used were the Internet (including government and World Health Organization websites), social media, television and radio. The authority, reliability, currency and relevance of the information were considered when evaluating COVID-19 information consulted, and were using the information primarily to ?keep safe? in accordance with government regulations, to provide library services on time and to plan for safe reopening. The barriers to information seeking and use were technical (poor telecommunications), financial (lack of funds to purchase resources) and physical (library closures). One barrier was the volume of information (both reliable and unreliable). Verification was viewed as important but seemingly difficult to do.

Materials and Methods: A total of 137 patients with Covid-19-associated pneumonia were included in the study. The patients were divided into three groups according to the severity of pneumonia as mild, moderate and severe. According to the severity of pneumonia, the parameters of complete blood count and the levels of biochemical parameters were compared between the groups. By examining blood parameters according to mortality, ROC analysis and regression analysis were performed to determine the net effect of these parameters on mortality. Results: As the severity of pneumonia increased, Prothrombin time (PT), International normalized ratio (INR) and Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) values were also increased, and a statistically significant difference was found between the groups in PT and INR values.

Many fungal peptidases are extracellular and are likely used to degrade proteins in their environment. Viral peptidases are processing enzymes, intimately involved in the virus infectious cycle. The viral RNA genome is translated by the host-cell machinery into a large polyprotein that is cleaved by the viral peptidases into mature capsid proteins, non-structural proteins and enzymes. I review the structure and catalytic mechanism of scytalidoglutamic peptidase isolated from the wood-destroying fungus Scytalidium lignicolum. This enzyme has a unique beta-sandwich fold and a novel catalytic mechanism based on a glutamate, a glutamine and a nucleophilic water molecule. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) 3C peptidase was the first structure identified for a viral 3C enzyme that exhibited the three-dimensional fold of the chymotrypsin family of serine peptidases but had a cysteine sulfur atom instead of the serine oxygen as the nucleophile. The structure of HAV 3C was unusual in that the Asp residue expected as the third member of the catalytic triad did not interact with the general base His.

To date, no standardized method for allocating scarce resources when the number of patients in need far exceeds capacity exists. We sought to derive and validate such a triage scheme. DESIGN : Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. SETTING Emergency departments of two urban tertiary care hospitals. PATIENTS Three separate cohorts of emergency department patients with suspected infection, comprising a total of 5,133 patients. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS A triage decision rule for use in an epidemic was developed using only those vital signs and patient characteristics that were readily available at initial presentation to the emergency department. The triage schema was derived from a cohort at center 1, validated on a second cohort from center 1, and then validated on a third cohort of patients from center 2. The primary outcome for the analysis was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were intensive care unit admission and use of mechanical ventilation. MAIN RESULTS Multiple logistic regression demonstrated the following as independent predictors of death: a) age of >65 yrs, b) altered mental status, c) respiratory rate of >30 breaths/min, d) low oxygen saturation, and e) shock index of >1 (heart rate > blood pressure). This model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 in the derivation set and 0.74 and 0.76 in the validation sets. When converted to a simple rule assigning 1 point per covariate, the discrimination of the model remained essentially unchanged. The model was equally effective at predicting need for intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS If, as expected, patient demand far exceeds the capability to provide critical care services in an epidemic, a fair and just system to allocate limited resources will be essential. The triage rule we have developed can serve as an initial guide for such a process.","Talmor, Daniel; Jones, Alan E; Rubinson, Lewis; Howell, Michael D; Shapiro, Nathan I",Critical care medicine,216,15

Using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus as a model, we engineered a different transcription regulatory circuit and isolated recombinant viruses. The transcription network allowed for efficient expression of the viral transcripts and proteins, and the recombinant viruses replicated to WT levels. Recombinant genomes were then constructed that contained mixtures of the WT and mutant regulatory circuits, reflecting recombinant viruses that might occur in nature. Although viable viruses could readily be isolated from WT and recombinant genomes containing homogeneous transcription circuits, chimeras that contained mixed regulatory networks were invariantly lethal, because viable chimeric viruses were not isolated. Mechanistically, mixed regulatory circuits promoted inefficient subgenomic transcription from inappropriate start sites, resulting in truncated ORFs and effectively minimize viral structural protein expression. Engineering regulatory transcription circuits of intercommunicating alleles successfully introduces genetic traps into a viral genome that are lethal in RNA recombinant progeny viruses.","Yount, Boyd; Roberts, Rhonda S; Lindesmith, Lisa; Baric, Ralph S",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,216,5

Given the current growing spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) around the world, it is imperative that businesses review their pandemic plans and be prepared in case this epidemic expands and affects more people and communities. Preparing for a potential infectious disease pandemic from influenza or a novel corona virus is an essential component of a business continuity plan, especially for businesses that provide critical healthcare and infrastructure services. Although many businesses and organisations have a pandemic plan or address pandemic preparedness in their business continuity plans, few have recently tested and updated their plans. Pandemics can not only interrupt an organisation's operations and compromise long-term viability of an enterprise, but also disrupt the provision of critical functions. Businesses that regularly test and update their pandemic plan can significantly reduce harmful impacts to the business, play a key role in protecting employees' and customers' health and safety, and limit the negative impact of a pandemic on the community and economy.","Koonin, Lisa M",Journal of business continuity & emergency planning,216,26

METHODS Review of medical records of 969 children admitted between 19 March and 7 August, 2020, to assess the clinico-demographic characteristics, disease severity and factors predicting outcome in COVID-19 children. Variables were compared between children who were previously healthy (Group I) and those with co-morbidity (Group II). RESULT 123 (71 boys) children with median (IQR) age of 3 (0.7- 6) years were admitted, of which 47 (38%) had co-morbidities. 39 (32 %) children required intensive care and 14 (11.4%) died. Male sex, respiratory manifestation, oxygen saturation <94% at admission, mechanical ventilation, inotrope, hospital stay of <10 days were independent predictors of mortality. Oxygen saturation <94% at admission (OR 35.9, 95% CI 1.5-856) and hospital stay <10 days (OR 9.1, 95% CI 1.04-99.1) were significant. CONCLUSION COVID-19 in children with co-morbidities causes severe disease. Association of mortality with oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter <94% on admission, and hospital stay <10 days, needs further evaluation.","Rao, Sudha; Gavali, Vrushabh; Prabhu, Shakuntala S; Mathur, Radhika; Dabre, Larissa Robert",Indian pediatrics,216,28

Mounting evidence suggests that hiatal hernias are more common following minimally invasive esophagectomy. Therefore, post-esophagectomy hiatal hernia and its treatment bear increasing significance. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the records of five patients with hiatal hernia following esophagectomy over a 5-year period. RESULTS Successful laparoscopic reduction of a post-esophagectomy hiatal hernia was done without mesh reinforcement in three patients. One patient underwent mesh reinforcement. One patient was found to have carcinomatosis upon laparoscopic inspection, and repair of the hiatal hernia was abandoned. There were no perioperative deaths or complications. One patient developed a recurrent hiatal hernia 14 months after repair of the initial hiatal hernia. Patients were discharged within a mean of 1.75 days after surgical repair. DISCUSSION We have successfully used laparoscopy to treat hiatal hernias after esophagectomy. The benefits conferred by laparoscopy, including better visualization of the right gastroepiploic artery supplying the gastric conduit, minimally invasive evaluation of the field for metastasis, and shorter recovery time, make it our favored approach. Here, we describe our experience with hiatal hernia following esophagectomy and our operative technique.","Erkmen, Cherie P; Raman, Vignesh; Ghushe, Neil D; Trus, Thadeus L",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,216,26

A 23-nucleotide (nt) region that included a 6-nt UUAAAA sequence (designated the AU sequence) common between wild-type RNA2 and mutant RNA3 supported both precise and imprecise homologous recombination, though the latter occurred with lower frequency. Doubling the length of the 6-nt AU sequence in RNA3 increased the incidence of imprecise crossovers by nearly threefold. Duplication or triplication of the length of the AU sequence in both RNA2 and RNA3 further raised the frequency of imprecise crossovers. The majority of imprecise crosses were located within or close to the extended AU sequence. Imprecise recombinants contained either nucleotide substitutions, nontemplated nucleotides, small deletions, or small sequence duplications within the region of crossovers. Deletion of the AU sequence from the homologous region in RNA3 resulted in the accumulation of only precise homologous recombinants. Our results provide experimental evidence that AU sequences can facilitate the formation of imprecise homologous recombinants. The generation of small additions or deletions can be explained by a misannealing mechanism within the AU sequences, while replicase errors during RNA copying might explain the occurrence of nucleotide substitutions or nontemplated nucleotides.","Nagy, P D; Bujarski, J J",Journal of virology,216,30

The COVID-19 reopening in Denmark included regulations introducing frequent hand washing. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if frequent hand washing increases the incidence of ICD in children. METHODS We conducted an observational study in Denmark during the reopening of schools and daycare facilities for children aged 0-12 years (April 22nd to May 1st 2020). A questionnaire was sent out to parents in four municipalities consisting of 20 questions about frequency of hand washing, use of hand sanitiser, symptoms of ICD, atopic dermatitis, allergy and predispositions. RESULTS The study included 6,273 children. In children without any prior symptoms of dermatitis, 42.4% experienced ICD (dry, red and itchy skin) due to increased hand hygiene. Schoolchildren had a 1.5 times greater relative risk of developing ICD than preschool children. Frequency of hand washing was a strong risk factor, whereas this was not the case for alcohol-based hand sanitiser. Hand washing 7-10 times/day and >10 times/day increased the relative risk by 1.83 and 2.23 times, respectively. CONCLUSIONS A higher frequency of hand washing during the COVID-19 reopening increased the incidence of ICD in children. Hand hygiene is essential in our fight against novel coronavirus, but prophylactic initiatives are important to reduce the possible long-term consequences of ICD in children.

Sorting of cargo by COPI requires GTP hydrolysis by ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF-1). This small GTPase recruits coatomer onto Golgi membranes and upon hydrolysis, is thought to release coatomer back into the cytosol. This step requires the activating protein, ARFGAP1. By coupling sorting to a cargo-induced sequestering of ARFGAP1, we have formulated a kinetic proof-reading model that explains how a GTP hydrolysis-driven coat release can yield an active sorting event. The sorting scheme predicts a dependency on the amount of ARFGAP1 and explains the recent experimental findings that ARF-1 and COPI detach with different time constants from the Golgi membrane in vivo.","Weiss, Matthias; Nilsson, Tommy",Traffic,216,16

Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), a spike (S) gene natural deletion mutant of TGEV, has a respiratory tissue tropism and causes mild or subclinical respiratory infections. Conventional antigen-based diagnostic tests fail to differentiate TGEV and PRCV, and a blocking ELISA test to serologically differentiate TGEV/PRCV-infected pigs is conducted on convalescent serum retrospectively after disease outbreaks. A reverse transcription (RT)-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers targeted to the S gene deletion region to differentiate TGEV/PRCV was developed. The specificity of the RT-nested PCR was confirmed with reference and recent field strains of TGEV/PRCV, and its sensitivity was analyzed by testing nasal and fecal samples collected from pigs at various days postinoculation (DPI) with TGEV or PRCV. Specific PCR products for TGEV/PRCV were detected only with the homologous reference or field coronaviruses and for 10-14 DPI of pigs with TGEV (feces) or PRCV (nasal samples). The RT-nested PCR assay was more sensitive than antigen-based assays on the basis of duration of virus detection in experimentally infected pigs and was directly applicable to nasal as well as fecal specimens from the field.","Kim, L; Chang, K O; Sestak, K; Parwani, A; Saif, L J","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",216,16

We describe the rapid bull-back technique used in four patients in which a small diameter microcatheter with the aid of a hydrophilic microguidewire was navigated along the inner surface of the aneurysm, making a loop in the dome, exiting the neck to reach distal intracranial vessels. After withdrawal of microguidewire, the microcatheter is pulled back rapidly up to a predetermined length. This maneuver results in elimination of the loop, straightening the microcatheter to allow an exchange procedure for another device to cross the neck distally and continue the embolization procedure. The rapid pull-back technique is useful during the endovascular treatment of wide-necked and/or giant aneurysms as it helps to achieve reliable access to the distal parent vessel with the microcatheter.

The aim of our study was to describe the prevalence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in non-critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and correlate such observations with the thromboprophylaxis received. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 67 patients admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 pneumonia. The diagnosis was confirmed using polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal specimens. The deep veins were examined using compression duplex ultrasonography with the transducer on B-mode. The patients were separated into two groups for statistical analysis: those receiving low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis and those receiving intermediate or complete anticoagulation treatment. Risk analysis and logistic regression were performed. RESULTS: Of the 67 patients, 57 were included in the present study after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria; 49.1% were women, and the patient mean age was 71.3 years. All 57 patients had undergone compression duplex ultrasonography. Of these 57 patients, 6 were diagnosed with DVT, for an in-hospital rate of DVT in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia of 10.5%. All the patients who had presented with DVT had been receiving low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis. The patients receiving prophylactic anticoagulation treatment had a greater risk of DVT (16.21%; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.28; P = .056) compared with those receiving intermediate or complete anticoagulation treatment. We also found a protective factor for DVT in the intermediate or complete anticoagulation treatment group (odds ratio, 0.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.46; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Non-critically ill, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have a high risk of DVT despite receipt of correct, standard thromboprophylaxis.","Jimenez-Guiu, Xavier; Huici-Sánchez, Malka; Romera-Villegas, Antonio; Izquierdo-Miranda, Alexandre; Sancho-Cerro, Ana; Vila-Coll, Ramon",J.

A prospective multicenter study of 220 patients with osteosarcoma around the knee,15.665314,9.024736,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To provide estimates of the relative rate of COVID-19 death in people <65 years old versus older individuals in the general population, the absolute risk of COVID-19 death at the population level during the first epidemic wave, and the proportion of COVID-19 deaths in non-elderly people without underlying diseases in epicenters of the pandemic. ELIGIBLE DATA: Cross-sectional survey of countries and US states with at least 800 COVID-19 deaths as of April 24, 2020 and with information on the number of deaths in people with age <65. Data were available for 14 countries (Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK) and 13 US states (California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania). We also examined available data on COVID-19 deaths in people with age <65 and no underlying diseases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of COVID-19 deaths in people <65 years old; relative mortality rate of COVID-19 death in people <65 versus &#8805;65 years old; absolute risk of COVID-19 death in people <65 and in those &#8805;80 years old in the general population as of June 17, 2020; absolute COVID-19 mortality rate expressed as equivalent of mortality rate from driving a motor vehicle. RESULTS: Individuals with age <65 account for 4.5-11.2% of all COVID-19 deaths in European countries and Canada, 8.3-22.7% in the US locations, and were the majority in India and Mexico. People <65 years old had 30- to 100-fold lower risk of COVID-19 death than those &#8805;65 years old in 11 European countries and Canada, 16- to 52-fold lower risk in US locations, and less than 10-fold in India and Mexico. The absolute risk of COVID-19 death as of June 17, 2020 for people <65 years old in high-income countries ranged from 10 (Germany) to 349 per million (New Jersey) and it was 5 per million in India and 96 per million in Mexico. The absolute risk of COVID-19 death for people &#8805;80 years old ranged from 0.6 (Florida) to 17.5 per thousand (Connecticut). The COVID-19 mortality rate in people <65 years old during the period of fatalities from the epidemic was equivalent to the mortality rate from driving between 4 and 82 miles per day for 13 countries and 5 states, and was higher (equivalent to the mortality rate from driving 106-483 miles per day) for 8 other states and the UK. People <65 years old without underlying predisposing conditions accounted for only 0.7-3.6% of all COVID-19 deaths in France, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Georgia, and New York City and 17.7% in Mexico. CONCLUSIONS: People <65 years old have very small risks of COVID-19 death even in pandemic epicenters and deaths for people <65 years without underlying predisposing conditions are remarkably uncommon. Strategies focusing specifically on protecting high-risk elderly individuals should be considered in managing the pandemic.","Ioannidis, John P A; Axfors, Cathrine; Contopoulos-Ioannidis, Despina G",Environ Res,216,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comparative analysis of the treatment of 72 patients with allergic rhinitis, divided into groups: I (main, n=21), which included immunocompromised patients who received sublingual allergen-specific immunotherapy with antipollin and inhaled immunotherapy with cycloferon (every other day, a course of 10 procedures, the total dose of Cycloferon per course is 1250 mg); II (comparison, n=22) - immunocompromised patients who received monotherapy with antipollinum and III (control, n=29) - patients with allergic rhinitis without signs of immunocompromise, who also received antipollinum. The effectiveness of therapy was assessed by the quality of life (RQLQ questionnaire), the severity of nasal symptoms (the patient's self-observation diary) and the need for drugs after a course of intranasal immunotherapy. RESULTS: The inclusion of cycloferon in the treatment of immunocompromised patients with allergic rhinitis increased its effectiveness - the severity of nasal symptoms decreased: in terms of sneezing, a decrease of 53.5 times versus 1.82 - in the control, «nasal congestion¼ - 6.3 times versus 2.6 - in the control, «itching in the nose¼ - 4.9 and 4.2 times, respectively (p<0.05). The changes had a positive effect on the total indicator of the quality of life of patients - an increase of 6.2 times (by 83.7%) (p>0.05) and significantly reduced the need for cromones (18 times, versus 10.3 - in the group comparison), inhaled corticosteroids (10.4 times versus 8 times in the comparison group, and in decongestans - 8.1 times versus 6.1 - in the comparison group (p>0.05)). CONCLUSIONS: The combined use of local immunotherapy with cycloferon and sublingual allergen-specific immunotherapy with antipollinum in immunocompromised patients with allergic rhinitis is the first-line method of choice that statistically significantly changes the quality of life of patients.","Tataurschikova, N S",Vestn Otorinolaringol,216,16

The pandemic led to a shortage of N95-grade filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), especially surgical-grade N95 FFRs for protection of healthcare professionals against airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We and others have previously reported promising decontamination methods that may be applied to the recycling and reuse of FFRs. In this study we tested disinfection of three viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, dried on a piece of meltblown fabric, the principal component responsible for filtering of fine particles in N95-level FFRs, under a range of temperatures (60-95 °C) at ambient or 100% relative humidity (RH) in conjunction with filtration efficiency testing. We found that heat treatments of 75 °C for 30 min or 85 °C for 20 min at 100% RH resulted in efficient decontamination from the fabric of SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), and another enveloped RNA virus, chikungunya virus vaccine strain 181/25 (CHIKV-181/25), without lowering the meltblown fabric's filtration efficiency.","Campos, Rafael K; Jin, Jing; Rafael, Grace H; Zhao, Mervin; Liao, Lei; Simmons, Graham; Chu, Steven; Weaver, Scott C; Chiu, Wah; Cui, Yi",ACS Nano,216,21

Community pharmacies are essential services authorized to continue their activity during the emergency. To date, a clear image is lacking of the critical issues Italian community pharmacists had to face and of how they responded in their daily work.. Objective To describe procedures and critical logistical-organizational issues encountered by Italian community pharmacists and to collect the main requests reported by patients to pharmacists. Setting A national survey on Italian community pharmacists. Method A cross-sectional survey using a reasoned questionnaire was sent during the pandemic peak to Italian pharmacies, divided in two groups according to the incidence of COVID-19: ""Red Zones"" and ""non-Red Zones"". Main outcome measure Exploring the most frequently adopted measures by the pharmacists. Results 169 community Pharmacists answered the questionnaire. The most frequently adopted measures were the use of gloves, surgical masks and protective barriers at the drug counter. Most implemented services for customers were: booking of prescriptions, delivery of medications and implementation of phone consultations. Overall, the questionnaire highlighted an increase in the number of health-related consultations and requests by customers. In Red Zones, there was a higher use of FFP2 and FFP3 masks by pharmacists, where customers were mainly interested in gaining information about specific classes of medications. Conclusion Community pharmacists adapted to lockdown measures by implementing a number of measures. There was an overall increase in pharmacists' personal protective equipment in Red Zones possibly linked to increased risk perception.","Giua, Corrado; Paoletti, Giovanni; Minerba, Luigi; Malipiero, Giacomo; Melone, Giulio; Heffler, Enrico; Pistone, Assunta; Keber, Enrico",Int. j. clin. pharm,216,33

METHODS: This cross-sectional, analytical and retrospective study included all patients aged &#8805;18 years (n = 502) who were hospitalised in Samsun, Turkey, for COVID-19 and were given favipiravir from the date between 25 March 2020 and 3 June 2020. RESULTS: In total, 58.6% (n = 294) of the patients were male and 24.5% (n = 123) were between the ages of 71 and 80 years. During the first case process, the mortality rate was 19.9%, whereas the rate of those who were discharged as is/followed up at home for 14 days was 37.3%. During the second case process, the mortality rate was 6.2%, and the rate of those who was discharged as is/followed up at home for 14 days was 65.6%. The mean length of hospital stay was 10.61 ± 8.17 days for the first and 7.97 ± 4.16 days for the second hospitalisation; this difference was significant. Mortality risk of those who used Tocilizumab or vitamin C beside Favipiravir was higher than those who did not. The length of hospital stay was higher in patients using tocilizumab than in those who did not (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Administration of favipiravir later in the course of the disease makes it difficult to achieve the true efficacy expected from the drug and also makes it difficult for other combination drugs to contribute to survival. Favipiravir may also be effective in case of recurrence.","Oruç, Muhammet Ali; Öz, Hatice; Öztürk, Onur",Int J Clin Pract,216,24

Motivated by the shortages of face masks and safety clothing at the beginning of the corona pandemic, we conducted studies on the sterilization of FF3 face masks with CAP and the resulting material effects. Therefore, the bactericidal and sporicidal efficacy of CAP afterglow sterilization of FFP3 mask material was investigated by inoculating fabric samples with test germs Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Bacillus atrophaeus (B. atrophaeus) and subsequent CAP afterglow treatment in a surface-micro-discharge (SMD) plasma device. In addition, a detailed analysis of the changes in long-term plasma treated (15h) mask material and its individual components - ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and polypropylene (PP) - was carried out using surface analysis methods such as laser microscopy, contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as well as fabric permeability and resistance measurements. The experiments showed that E. coli and B. atrophaeus could both be effectively inactivated by plasma treatment in nitrogen mode (12 kVpp, 5 kHz). For B. atrophaeus inactivation of more than 4-log was achieved after 30 minutes. E. coli population could be reduced by 5-log within one minute of CAP treatment and after five minutes a complete inactivation (>6-log) was achieved. Material analysis showed that long-term (>5 h) plasma treatment affects the electrostatic properties of the fabric. From this it can be deduced that the plasma treatment of FFP3 face masks with the CAP afterglow of an SMD device effectively inactivates microorganisms on the fabric. FFP3 masks can be plasma decontaminated and reused multiple times but only to a limited extent, as otherwise the permeability levels no longer meet the DIN EN 149 specifications.","Schmidt, Alisa; Tschang, Chen-Yon Tobias; Sann, Joachim; Thoma, Markus H.",,216,16

METHOD: The Schlieren method with a single curved mirror was used in this study. Coughed air has a slightly higher temperature than ambient air, which generates a refractive index gradient. A curved mirror with a radius of curvature of 10 m and a diameter of 60 cm was used. The spread of the cough wavefront was investigated among five subjects wearing: (1) no mask; (2) a single surgical mask; (3) a double surgical mask; (4) a cloth mask; (5) a valveless N95 mask; and (6) a valved N95 mask. RESULTS: All mask types reduced the size of the contaminated region significantly. The percentage reduction in the cross-sectional area of the contaminated region for the same mask types on different subjects revealed by normalized data suggests that the fit of a mask plays an important role. CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference in the spread of coughed air was found between the use of a single surgical mask or a double surgical mask. Cloth masks may be effective, depending on the quality of the cloth. Valved N95 masks exclusively protect the user. The fit of a mask is an important factor to minimize the contaminated region.","Tanisali, Gokhan; Sozak, Ahmet; Bulut, Abdul Samet; Sander, Tolga Ziya; Dogan, Ozlem; Dag, Çagdas; Gönen, Mehmet; Can, Fusun; DeMirci, Hasan; Ergonul, Onder",Int J Infect Dis,216,1

Chronic disease care has also changed for many patients, with uncertain downstream consequences. METHODS: We included participants with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions followed by specialists at Johns Hopkins. Participants completed periodic surveys querying comorbidities, disease-modifying medications, exposures, COVID-19 testing and outcomes, social behaviors, and disruptions to healthcare. We assessed whether COVID-19 risk is higher among those on immunomodulating or suppressive agents and characterized pandemic-associated changes to care and mental health. RESULTS: 265 (5.6%) developed COVID-19 over 9 months of follow-up (April-December 2020). Patient characteristics (age, race, comorbidity, medications) were associated with differences in social distancing behaviors during the pandemic. Glucocorticoid exposure was associated with higher odds of COVID-19 in models incorporating behavior and other potential confounders (OR: 1.43; 95%CI: 1.08, 1.89). Other medication classes were not associated with COVID-19 risk. Diabetes (OR: 1.72; 95%CI: 1.08, 2.73), cardiovascular disease (OR: 1.68; 95%CI: 1.24, 2.28), and kidney disease (OR: 1.76; 95%CI: 1.04, 2.97) were associated with higher odds of COVID-19.

In nineteenth century Europe, puerperal fever (childbed fever) was a major clinical and public health problem with very high maternal mortality. It was thought to be caused by miasma, epidemicity, or the Will of Providence. Apart from bloodletting, there was no cure for it. Semmelweis cared for the childbed fever women during their illness, and when they died, he did autopsies on them. Astute clinical observations and logical reasoning goaded Semmelweis to suspect the role of ""unholy"" hands of ""holy"" physicians in the transmission of puerperal fever. He enforced a hand-washing policy for physicians. Those with unwashed hands were disallowed into labor room. The hand-washing practice for 1 year led to unprecedented decrease in maternal mortality. It enabled Semmelweis to establish a strong, specific, temporal causal association between unclean hands and puerperal fever. Although not accepted during his lifetime, this causal hypothesis contributed significantly to the understanding of etiopathophysiology of not only puerperal fever but also many other communicable diseases. Clinical hand washing, since then, has prevented millions of deaths of humankind. In the present times too, his idea of hand hygiene plays a central role in COVID-19 pandemic management.

Some studies have suggested that diabetes is associated with a greater risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19. The primary objective of the present study was to compare the clinical features and outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with vs without diabetes. METHODS: All consecutive adult patients admitted to Amiens University Hospital (Amiens, France) with confirmed COVID-19 up until April 21st, 2020, were included. The composite primary endpoint comprised admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and death. Both components were also analysed separately in a logistic regression analysis and a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: A total of 433 patients (median age: 72; 238 (55%) men; diabetes: 115 (26.6%)) were included. Most of the deaths occurred in non-ICU units and among older adults. Multivariate analyses showed that diabetes was associated neither with the primary endpoint (odds ratio (OR): 1.12; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66-1.90) nor with mortality (hazard ratio: 0.73; 95%CI: 0.40-1.34) but was associated with ICU admission (OR: 2.06; 95%CI 1.09-3.92, P = .027) and a longer length of hospital stay. Age was negatively associated with ICU admission and positively associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes was prevalent in a quarter of the patients hospitalized with COVID-19; it was associated with a greater risk of ICU admission but not with a significant elevation in mortality.

Among compounds proposed to fight the SARS-CoV-2-related disease (COVID-19), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), already effective in Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), have been proposed on the basis of their antiviral action already demonstrated against SARS-CoV-1. Very few cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Ph+ ALL and in CML Italian cohorts; authors suggested that this low rate of infections might depend on the use of TKIs, but the biological causes of this phenomenon remain unknown. In this study, the CML model was used to test if TKIs would sustain or not the viral replication and if they could damage patient immunity. Firstly, the infection and replication rate of torquetenovirus (TTV), whose load is inversely proportional to the host immunological control, have been measured in CML patients receiving nilotinib. A very low percentage of subjects were infected at baseline, and TTV did not replicate or at least showed a low replication rate during the follow-up, with a mean load comparable to the measured one in healthy subjects. Then, after gene expression profiling experiments, we found that several “antiviral” genes, such as CD28 and IFN gamma, were upregulated, while genes with “proviral” action, such as ARG-1, CEACAM1, and FUT4, were less expressed during treatment with imatinib, thus demonstrating that TKIs are not detrimental from the immunological point of view. To sum up, our data could offer some biological explanations to the low COVID-19 occurrence in Ph+ ALL and CML patients and sustain the use of TKIs in COVID-19, as already proposed by several international ongoing studies.","Galimberti, Sara; Petrini, Mario; Baratè, Claudia; Ricci, Federica; Balducci, Serena; Grassi, Susanna; Guerrini, Francesca; Ciabatti, Elena; Mechelli, Sandra; Di Paolo, Antonello; Baldini, Chiara; Baglietto, Laura; Macera, Lisa; Spezia, Pietro Giorgio; Maggi, Fabrizio",Front.

The reason why this research uses a sentiment case study towards Trump and Jokowi's policies is because Jokowi and Trump have similarities in handling Covid-19. Indonesia and the US are still low in the discipline in implementing health protocols. The data collection period was chosen on September 21 - October 21 2020 because during that period, the top 5 trending on Twitter included # covid19, #jokowi, #miglobal, #trump, and #donaldtrump. So, this period is most appropriate for taking data and discussing the handling of Covid-19 by Jokowi and Trump. The result shows both Jokowi and Trump have higher negative sentiments than positive sentiments during the period. Trump had issued a controversial statement regarding the handling of Covid-19. This research is limited to the sentiment generated by the policies conveyed by the US and Indonesian Governments via @jokowi and @realDonaldTrump Twitter Account.

In this study, different BC/Fe composites were synthesized by controlling the pyrolysis temperatures (500-800 °C).

METHODS: Data were collected within two weeks after the Chinese government announced the work resumption of industrial enterprises. During this period, 526 returned workers participated in the study. RESULTS: The results showed that the psychosocial stress caused by the epidemic had a positive impact on work stress. Both perceived organizational support and perceived that social support can alleviate the impact of psychosocial stress on work stress. The moderating effect of epidemic awareness was only established in non-severe epidemic areas. CONCLUSIONS: In the current period of the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, the conclusions of this study have a certain theoretical significance and practical value.","Yang, Qiang; Huo, Jiale; Li, Jiang; Jiang, Yushi",Work,216,24

In compliance with WHO recommendation of movement restrictions, many countries have imposed compulsory self-quarantine and restricted movements of their citizenries (lockdown/sit at home) and closure of businesses and borders as preventive measures to the fast-spreading virus. Consequently, this decision has made the emergence of behaviors that are detrimental to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) which are the leading cause of the global mortality rate. MAIN BODY: The increase in sedentary lifestyles, alcohol consumption, and substance abuse during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown as a result of personal restrictions in COVID-19 lockdown is linked with the risk of death from chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). CONCLUSION: The lockdown has increased risk factors of CVDs, and as such, there might be an increase in the number of non-communicable disease (NCD)-related mortality rate. The effect does not end during the period of coronavirus pandemic but even after the pandemic.","Muhammad, Daha Garba; Abubakar, Ibrahim Ahmad",Egypt Heart J,216,26

It is shown to be useful in the management of psychotic disorders for decades, more so in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia when given with antipsychotic medications. We highlight a case of a 37-year-old lady who was on treatment for refractory schizophrenia for the past 10 years but had continued to exhibit residual psychotic symptoms of auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions that resulted in numerous in-patient admissions. She was initiated on ECT but contracted the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) before she could receive her second session. After isolating for 2 weeks in a COVID-19-designated isolation ward and testing negative twice, she was rescheduled to continue with her ECT. Ten minutes after leaving theater upon successfully undergoing her second ECT session, she collapsed suddenly and died. An autopsy done later revealed pulmonary thromboembolism as the cause of death. CONCLUSIONS: Although ECT is a safe procedure, caution should be exercised in the context of COVID-19, as it is now clear that patients who recovered from COVID-19 might have an undetected venous thromboembolism that can cause untoward outcomes.

Estimates of the impact of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission are critical for decision making in this and future outbreaks. We here aim to assess the impact of these NPIs on disease transmission by estimating changes in the basic reproduction number (R0) at national and cantonal levels in relation to the timing of these NPIs. We estimated the time-varying R0 nationally and in eleven cantons by fitting a stochastic transmission model explicitly simulating within-hospital dynamics. We used individual-level data from more than 1000 hospitalised patients in Switzerland and public daily reports of hospitalisations and deaths. We estimated the national R0 to be 2.8 (95% confidence interval 2.1&ndash;3.8) at the beginning of the epidemic. Starting from around 7 March, we found a strong reduction in time-varying R0 with a 86% median decrease (95% quantile range [QR] 79&ndash;90%) to a value of 0.40 (95% QR 0.3&ndash;0.58) in the period of 29 March to 5 April. At the cantonal level, R0 decreased over the course of the epidemic between 53% and 92%. Reductions in time-varying R0 were synchronous with changes in mobility patterns as estimated through smartphone activity, which started before the official implementation of NPIs. We inferred that most of the reduction of transmission is attributable to behavioural changes as opposed to natural immunity, the latter accounting for only about 4% of the total reduction in effective transmission. As Switzerland considers relaxing some of the restrictions of social mixing, current estimates of time-varying R0 well below one are promising. However, as of 24 April 2020, at least 96% (95% QR 95.7&ndash;96.4%) of the Swiss population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. These results warrant a cautious relaxation of social distance practices and close monitoring of changes in both the basic and effective reproduction numbers.","Lemaitre, Joseph C; Perez-Saez, Javier; Azman, Andrew S; Rinaldo, Andrea; Fellay, Jacques",Swiss Med Wkly,216,16

Here, we report a proof-of-concept approach for the development of quantitative, multiplexed flow cytometry-based serological and neutralization assays. The serology assays test the IgG and IgM against both the full-length spike antigens and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike antigen. Benchmarking against an RBD-specific SARS-CoV IgG reference standard, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody titer was quantified in the range of 37.6 µg/mL to 31.0 ng/mL. The quantitative assays are highly specific with no correlative cross-reactivity with the spike proteins of MERS, SARS1, OC43 and HKU1 viruses. We further demonstrated good correlation between anti-RBD antibody titers and neutralizing antibody titers. The suite of serology and neutralization assays help to improve measurement confidence and are complementary and foundational for clinical and epidemiologic studies.","Tian, Linhua; Elsheikh, Elzafir B; Patrone, Paul N; Kearsley, Anthony J; Gaigalas, Adolfas K; Inwood, Sarah; Lin-Gibson, Sheng; Esposito, Dominic; Wang, Lili",Int. j. mol. sci.

Because no isolation facility could accommodate both patient and mother, they were separated for 10 days, during which time the patient was switched from breastmilk to formula. Her subsequent clinical course was marked by several weeks of supplemental oxygen, sepsis-like presentations requiring additional antibiotics and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

However, COVID-19 has dramatically affected their lives due to many months of school closures intended to prevent the spread of the infection. In the Czech Republic, secondary schools were closed from 14 October 2020 to 24 May 2021 with a short break before Christmas. However, the students were most often infected by their parents, who usually became infected at work. The aim of this study was to find out by means of antibody testing how many high school students in Havlíčkův Brod have undergone the infection. We used questionnaires to find out how many students were in quarantine. The group included 196 students aged 15-19. Examination of IgG antibodies against the S antigen (Abbott, Architect) was performed in June 2021. Antibodies were detected in 90 of 196 students (45.9%). Coronavirus infection was reported in 88 families. Antibodies were detected in 61 quarantined students (69.3%), while the remaining 27 students had neither antibodies, nor clinical signs, nor positive PCR test. Thus, these students are considered unsusceptible to the infection at the time of quarantine. Despite the interruption of teaching in schools and the associated reduction of contacts, a significant share of students met with the coronavirus. About half of the students in the sample are already largely resistant to the disease (have antibodies). Another part of the students was unsusceptible to the disease, because they did not fall sick despite having been in contact with an infected family member.","Fejt, V.; Krátká, Z.; Zelená, H.; Komárek, A.",Cas Lek Cesk,216,16

RESULTS: There has been a greater than 50% drop in the number of patients presenting to cardiology and those diagnosed with myocardial infarction. All areas of cardiology service provision sustained significant reductions, which included outpatient clinics, investigations, procedures and cardiology community services such as heart failure and cardiac rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: As ischaemic heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death nationally and globally, cardiology services need to prepare for a significant increase in workload in the recovery phase and develop new pathways to urgently help those adversely affected by the changes in service provision.","Fersia, Omar; Bryant, Sue; Nicholson, Rachael; McMeeken, Karen; Brown, Carolyn; Donaldson, Brenda; Jardine, Aaron; Grierson, Valerie; Whalen, Vanessa; Mackay, Alistair",,216,16

The endothelium is one target of SARS-CoV-2. Damaged endothelial cells, which break away from organs and enter the bloodstream to form circulating endothelial cells, were recently reported as putative biomarkers for COVID-19. Modulation of the expression level of sphingosine-1 phosphate via sphingosine kinase activation can control endothelial cell proliferation and apoptosis. As such, it may be possible to obtain a sensitive and specific diagnosis of the severity of COVID-19 by assessing the absolute number and the viable/apoptotic ratio of circulating endothelial cells. Furthermore, a focus on the endothelium could help to develop a strategy for COVID-19 treatment from the perspective of endothelial protection and repair.","Zhang, Xuchang; Jiang, Man; Yang, Jianshe",Int J Infect Dis,216,1

Diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection is based on real-time polymerase chain reaction performed on nasopharyngeal swab. If not adequately performed, the viral specimen collection can be painful and lead to complications. We present a complication occurred during a nasopharyngeal swab collection performed in a noncooperative patient where the plastic shaft of the swab fractured during the procedure, resulting in swab tip retention deep into the nasal cavity. The foreign body was found endoscopically, stuck between the nasal septum and the superior turbinate tail at the upper level of the left choana and removed under general anesthesia in a negative pressure operating room with the health care personnel wearing personal protective equipment. Unpleasant complications like the one described can happen when the swab is collected without the necessary knowledge of nasal anatomy or conducted inappropriately, especially in noncooperative patients. Moreover, the design of currently used viral swabs may expose to accidental rupture, with risk of foreign body retention in the nasal cavities. In such cases, diagnosis and treatment are endoscopy-guided procedures performed in an adequate setting to minimize the risk of spreading of the pandemic.","Gaffuri, Michele; Capaccio, Pasquale; Torretta, Sara; Daga, Marco; Zuccotti, Gian Vincenzo; Pignataro, Lorenzo",Ear Nose Throat J,216,1

Here, we describe a novel aspect of coronaviral infection, whereby the master transcriptional regulator of lysosome biogenesis - TFEB - is targeted for proteasomal-mediated degradation upon viral infection. Through mass spectrometry analysis and an unbiased siRNA screen, we identify that TFEB protein stability is coordinately regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit DCAF7 and the PAK2 kinase. In particular, viral infection triggers marked PAK2 activation, which in turn, phosphorylates and primes TFEB for ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Deletion of either DCAF7 or PAK2 blocks viral-mediated TFEB degradation and protects against viral-induced cytopathic effects. We further derive a series of small molecules that interfere with the DCAF7-TFEB interaction. These agents inhibit viral-triggered TFEB degradation and demonstrate broad anti-viral activities including attenuating in vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, these results delineate a viral-triggered pathway that disables the endogenous cellular system that maintains lysosomal function and suggest that small molecule inhibitors of the E3 ubiquitin ligase DCAF7 represent a novel class of endo-lysosomal, host-directed, anti-viral therapies.","Liu, Y.; Lear, T.; Larsen, M.; Lin, B.; Cao, Q.; Alfaras, I.; Kennerdell, J.; Salminen, L.; Camarco, D.; Lockwood, K.; Ma, J.; Liu, J.; Tan, J.; Myerburg, M.; Chen, Y.; Croix, C.

COVID-19 typically presents as viral pneumonia, occasionally leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. However, emerging evidence suggests that it has a significant impact on the cardiovascular (CV) system by direct myocardial damage, severe systemic inflammatory response, hypoxia, right heart strain secondary to ARDS and lung injury, and plaque rupture secondary to inflammation. Primary cardiac manifestations include acute myocarditis, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and abnormal clotting.

We synthesized the evidence regarding efficacy and safety (review 1), as well as risks of droplet dispersion, aerosol generation, and associated transmission (review 2) of viral products. SOURCE: Literature searches were performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Chinese databases, and medRxiv. Review 1: we synthesized results from randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HFNC to conventional oxygen therapy (COT) in critically ill patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Review 2: we narratively summarized findings from studies evaluating droplet dispersion, aerosol generation, or infection transmission associated with HFNC. For both reviews, paired reviewers independently conducted screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. We evaluated certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: No eligible studies included COVID-19 patients. Review 1: 12 RCTs (n = 1,989 patients) provided low-certainty evidence that HFNC may reduce invasive ventilation (relative risk [RR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 0.99) and escalation of oxygen therapy (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.98) in patients with respiratory failure. Results provided no support for differences in mortality (moderate certainty), or in-hospital or intensive care length of stay (moderate and low certainty, respectively). Review 2: four studies evaluating droplet dispersion and three evaluating aerosol generation and dispersion provided very low certainty evidence. Two simulation studies and a crossover study showed mixed findings regarding the effect of HFNC on droplet dispersion. Although two simulation studies reported no associated increase in aerosol dispersion, one reported that higher flow rates were associated with increased regions of aerosol density. CONCLUSIONS: High-flow nasal cannula may reduce the need for invasive ventilation and escalation of therapy compared with COT in COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. This benefit must be balanced against the unknown risk of airborne transmission.","Agarwal, Arnav; Basmaji, John; Muttalib, Fiona; Granton, David; Chaudhuri, Dipayan; Chetan, Devin; Hu, Malini; Fernando, Shannon M; Honarmand, Kimia; Bakaa, Layla; Brar, Sonia; Rochwerg, Bram; Adhikari, Neill K; Lamontagne, Francois; Murthy, Srinivas; Hui, David S C; Gomersall, Charles; Mubareka, Samira; Diaz, Janet V; Burns, Karen E A; Couban, Rachel; Ibrahim, Quazi; Guyatt, Gordon H; Vandvik, Per O",Can J Anaesth,216,15

Numerous ongoing and recently published studies about the disease have emerged. However, the research regarding COVID-19 is largely ongoing and inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: A potential way to accelerate COVID-19 research is to use existing information gleaned from research into other viruses that belong to the coronavirus family. Our objective is to develop a natural language processing method for answering factoid questions related to COVID-19 using published articles as knowledge sources. METHODS: Given a question, first, a BM25-based context retriever model is implemented to select the most relevant passages from previously published articles. Second, for each selected context passage, an answer is obtained using a pretrained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) question-answering model. Third, an opinion aggregator, which is a combination of a biterm topic model and k-means clustering, is applied to the task of aggregating all answers into several opinions. RESULTS: We applied the proposed pipeline to extract answers, opinions, and the most frequent words related to six questions from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge. By showing the longitudinal distributions of the opinions, we uncovered the trends of opinions and popular words in the articles published in the five time periods assessed: before 1990, 1990-1999, 2000-2009, 2010-2018, and since 2019. The changes in opinions and popular words agree with several distinct characteristics and challenges of COVID-19, including a higher risk for senior people and people with pre-existing medical conditions; high contagion and rapid transmission; and a more urgent need for screening and testing. The opinions and popular words also provide additional insights for the COVID-19-related questions. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other methods of literature retrieval and answer generation, opinion aggregation using our method leads to more interpretable, robust, and comprehensive question-specific literature reviews. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method in answering COVID-19-related questions with main opinions and capturing the trends of research about COVID-19 and other relevant strains of coronavirus in recent years.","Lu, Zhao-Hua; Wang, Jade Xiaoqing; Li, Xintong",J Med Internet Res,216,1

We can predict that the COVID-19 pandemic would leave the mind lonely and vulnerable to diseases, for, on the one hand, the COVID-19 pandemic and related problems, in particular social isolation, are itself stressor. On the other hand, studies confirm the potential of COVID-19 to involve the central nervous system by affecting the immune system, either directly or indirectly. The COVID-19 condition, thus, calls for a necessary compensation of loneliness to reduce the psychological impact of the pandemic. Not only art can fulfill this purpose by meeting social affiliation needs, but also its related creativity is a definite achievement of the performer while acting as a motivation facilitator of creation for the observer. Besides, artworks that illustrate effective hygiene behaviors and physical distancing in an easy-to-understand manner could help health information systems to control the spread of COVID-19. The integration of art with biomedical science applied for simulation of the infected population, lung imaging data, and the viral surface has been useful for prediction of the spread of disease and earlier diagnosis of COVID-19 by imaging techniques and might be a contributor to drug discovery for COVID-19. Also, arts admirably influence the immunoemotional regulatory system so that not only would it enable humanity to tolerate quarantine but also enhance antiviral immunity. More interestingly, the effects of dance have been observed in children, elderly, healthcare workers, and pregnant women, which have been of special attention during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Prevention remains the mainstay in treating and defeating the COVID-19 epidemic. Anyone infected or suspected of being infected should self-quarantine at home or admit themselves to a specified hospital with infrastructure to handle the situation. The combination of prevention and containment provides the best opportunity to stall the spread of COVID-19.","Baghchechi, Mohsen; Dunn, Jeffery; Jaipaul, Navin; Jacob, Sharon E",,216,5

The S protein engages ACE2 through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), an independently folded 197-amino-acid fragment of the 1,273-amino-acid S-protein protomer. The RBD is the primary SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing epitope and a critical target of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Here, we show that this RBD conjugated to each of two carrier proteins elicited more potent neutralizing responses in immunized rodents than did a similarly conjugated proline-stabilized S-protein ectodomain. Nonetheless, the native RBD is expressed inefficiently, limiting its usefulness as a vaccine antigen. However, we show that an RBD engineered with four novel glycosylation sites (gRBD) is expressed markedly more efficiently and generates a more potent neutralizing responses as a DNA vaccine antigen than the wild-type RBD or the full-length S protein, especially when fused to multivalent carriers, such as a Helicobacter pylori ferritin 24-mer. Further, gRBD is more immunogenic than the wild-type RBD when administered as a subunit protein vaccine. Our data suggest that multivalent gRBD antigens can reduce costs and doses, and improve the immunogenicity, of all major classes of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.IMPORTANCE All available vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) express or deliver the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. We show that this antigen is not optimal, consistent with observations that the vast majority of the neutralizing response to the virus is focused on the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, this RBD is not expressed well as an independent domain, especially when expressed as a fusion protein with a multivalent scaffold. We therefore engineered a more highly expressed form of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD by introducing four glycosylation sites into a face of the RBD normally occluded in the full S protein. We show that this engineered protein, gRBD, is more immunogenic than the wild-type RBD or the full-length S protein in both genetic and protein-delivered vaccines.","Guo, Yan; He, Wenhui; Mou, Huihui; Zhang, Lizhou; Chang, Jing; Peng, Shoujiao; Ojha, Amrita; Tavora, Rubens; Parcells, Mark S; Luo, Guangxiang; Li, Wenhui; Zhong, Guocai; Choe, Hyeryun; Farzan, Michael; Quinlan, Brian D",mBio (Online),216,30

Health systems worldwide have moved quickly to implement telemedicine in diverse settings to reduce infection, but little is understood about how best to connect patients who are acutely ill with nearby clinical team members, even in the next room. OBJECTIVE: To inform these efforts, this paper aims to provide an early example of inpatient telemedicine implementation and its perceived acceptability and effectiveness. METHODS: Using purposive sampling, this study conducted 15 semistructured interviews with nurses (5/15, 33%), attending physicians (5/15, 33%), and resident physicians (5/15, 33%) on a single COVID-19 unit within Stanford Health Care to evaluate implementation outcomes and perceived effectiveness of inpatient telemedicine. Semistructured interview protocols and qualitative analysis were framed around the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework, and key themes were identified using a rapid analytic process and consensus approach. RESULTS: All clinical team members reported wide reach of inpatient telemedicine, with some use for almost all patients with COVID-19. Inpatient telemedicine was perceived to be effective in reducing COVID-19 exposure and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) without significantly compromising quality of care. Physician workflows remained relatively stable, as most standard clinical activities were conducted via telemedicine following the initial intake examination, though resident physicians reported reduced educational opportunities given limited opportunities to conduct physical exams. Nurse workflows required significant adaptations to cover nonnursing duties, such as food delivery and facilitating technology connections for patients and physicians alike. Perceived patient impact included consistent care quality, with some considerations around privacy. Reported challenges included patient-clinical team communication and personal connection with the patient, perceptions of patient isolation, ongoing technical challenges, and certain aspects of the physical exam. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical team members reported inpatient telemedicine encounters to be acceptable and effective in reducing COVID-19 exposure and PPE use. Nurses adapted their workflows more than physicians in order to implement the new technology and bore a higher burden of in-person care and technical support. Recommendations for improved inpatient telemedicine use include information technology support and training, increased technical functionality, and remote access for the clinical team.","Safaeinili, Nadia; Vilendrer, Stacie; Williamson, Emma; Zhao, Zicheng; Brown-Johnson, Cati; Asch, Steven M; Shieh, Lisa",JMIR Form Res,216,22

An important facet of the discussion is how they should be financed. The negative impacts of Covid-19 on national budgets and sovereign debt question whether the implementation of Green New Deals is feasible if austerity needs to be introduced to achieve sustainability. This article assesses whether a wealth tax based upon the work of Michal Kalecki could help avoid austerity measures and facilitate the introduction of Green New Deals. While wealth taxes have traditionally been defined on net worth or assets to reduce wealth inequality, the formulation is meant to be equitable by applying to gross wealth or assets. Estimates are calculated for the United States and turn out to be quite modest. The approach not only generates revenue to cover expected net interest outlays on national debt, but additional revenue to pay down portions of it and/or support green initiatives, such as Biden’s de-carbonisation policy. The article concludes with a discussion of challenges for the tax’s effectiveness.JEL Codes: H2, H3, B2, B3","Schroeder, Susan",The Economic and Labour Relations Review : ELRR,216,16

The consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are devastating and represent the current major public health issue across the globe. At the onset, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the respiratory system as it represents the main point of entry in the host, but it also can affect multiple organs. Although most of the patients do not present symptoms or are mildly symptomatic, some people infected with SARS-CoV-2 that experience more severe multiorgan dysfunction. The severity of COVID-19 is typically combined with a set of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and/or advanced age that seriously exacerbates the consequences of the infection. Also, SARS-CoV-2 can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain during the early phases of the disease. Intestinal dysfunction induces changes in intestinal microbes, and an increase in inflammatory cytokines. Thus, diagnosing gastrointestinal symptoms that precede respiratory problems during COVID-19 may be necessary for improved early detection and treatment. Uncovering the composition of the microbiota and its metabolic products in the context of COVID-19 can help determine novel biomarkers of the disease and help identify new therapeutic targets. Elucidating changes to the microbiome as reliable biomarkers in the context of COVID-19 represent an overlooked piece of the disease puzzle and requires further investigation.","Villapol, Sonia",Transl Res,216,16

DSV is an Ayurvedic medicine used for the treatment of chronic cough and inflammation. The formulation has shown its pharmacological effects against SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammation in the humanized zebrafish model. The present inventive research aimed to establish comprehensive quality parameters of the DSV formulation using validated chromatographic analytical tools. Exhaustive identification of signature marker compounds present in the plant ingredients was carried out using ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/QToF MS). This was followed by simultaneous estimation of selected marker components using rapid and reliable high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Eleven marker components, namely gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, methyl gallate, ellagic acid, coumarin, cinnamic acid, glycyrrhizin, eugenol, 6-gingerol, piperine and glabridin, were selected out of seventy-four identified makers for the quantitative analysis in DSV formulation. Validation of the HPLC method was evaluated by its linearity, precision, and accuracy tests as per the International Council of Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. Calibration curves for the eleven marker compounds showed good linear regression (r2 > 0.999). The relative standard deviation (RSD) value of intraday and interday precision tests were within the prescribed limits. The accuracy test results ranged from 92.75% to 100.13%.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Is the clinical application of sigh during pressure support ventilation (PSV) feasible? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a multi-center non-inferiority randomized clinical trial on adult intubated patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome undergoing PSV. Patients were randomized to the No Sigh group and treated by PSV alone, or to the Sigh group, treated by PSV plus sigh (increase of airway pressure to 30 cmH2Ofor 3 seconds once per minute) until day 28 or death or successful spontaneous breathing trial. The primary endpoint of the study was feasibility, assessed as non-inferiority (5% tolerance) in the proportion of patients failing assisted ventilation. Secondary outcomes included safety, physiological parameters in the first week from randomization, 28-day mortality and ventilator-free days. RESULTS: Two-hundred fifty-eight patients (31% women; median age 65 [54-75] years) were enrolled. In the Sigh group, 23% of patients failed to remain on assisted ventilation vs. 30% in the No Sigh group (absolute difference -7%, 95%CI -18% to 4%; p=0.015 for non-inferiority). Adverse events occurred in 12% vs. 13% in Sigh vs. No Sigh (p=0.852). Oxygenation was improved while tidal volume, respiratory rate and corrected minute ventilation were lower over the first 7 days from randomization in Sigh vs. No Sigh. There was no significant difference in terms of mortality (16% vs. 21%, p=0.342) and ventilator-free days (22 [7-26] vs. 22 [3-25] days, p=0.300) for Sigh vs. No Sigh.

The rapid growth of recorded information has led to big data platforms in healthcare that could be used to improve patients' primary care and serve various secondary purposes. Patient similarity assessment is one of the secondary tasks in identifying patients who are similar to a given patient, and it helps derive insights from similar patients' records to provide better treatment. This type of assessment is based on calculating the distance between patients. Since representing and calculating the similarity of patients plays an essential role in many secondary uses of electronic records, this article examines a new data representation method for Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) while taking into account the information in clinical narratives for similarity computing. Some previous works are based on structured data types, while other works only use unstructured data. However, a comprehensive representation of the information contained in the EMR requires the effective aggregation of both structured and unstructured data. To address the limitations of previous methods, we propose a method that captures the co-occurrence of different medical events, including signs, symptoms, and diseases extracted via unstructured data and structured data. It integrates data as discriminative features to construct a temporal tree, considering the difference between events that have short-term and long-term impacts. Our results show that considering signs, symptoms, and diseases in every time interval leads to less MSE and more precision compared to baseline representations that do not consider this information or consider them separately from structured data.","Memarzadeh, Hoda; Ghadiri, Nasser; Shahreza, Maryam Lotfi; Pokharel, Suresh",,216,20

To investigate the serum hepatic enzyme activities in different phenotypes of COVID-19 patients, evaluate their relationship with the illness severity and analyze the correlation of glycyrrhizin treatment and abnormal liver enzyme activities, one hundred and forty-seven patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in a retrospective study that investigated hepatic dysfunction. Liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), Y-glutamyl transferase (GGT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were analyzed in these patients.

The peak of abnormal hepatic enzyme activities occurred at 3 to 6 days after on admission. Serum AST and LDH levels were elevated, while the SOD level was decreased in severe and critical patients, compared with mild cases. DG treatment may alleviate the abnormal liver enzyme activities in non-critical COVID-19 patients. Abnormal liver functions may be observed in patients with COVID-19, and were associated with SARS-CoV-2-induced acute liver damage.

The empirical results elucidate the psychological mechanism behind the formation of humanizing digital experiences, showing that a 360° AR panorama shapes three features of a humanizing experience—anthropomorphism, self-representation, and intimacy—significantly better than a spin of the mouse, resulting in a stronger effect on green destination brand love. Furthermore, the technology readiness of online tourists significantly moderates the effects of a humanizing digital experience on green destination brand love. This study demonstrates how an emerging disruptive technology, AR, may help meet the need for contactless services in unique situations, such as the unexpected COVID-19 pandemic. The study helps researchers of green destination brand love and AR better understand what a humanizing digital experience in contactless service journeys can offer, paving the way for further research and practical development in this area. Because AR can be used to process big data, ethical compliance is also addressed.","Huang, Tseng-Lung Liu Ben S. C.",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,216,1

This paper proposes a conceptualization of Interactive Feedback (IF) for Mathematics, which is a step-by-step interactive process that guides the learner in the resolution of a task after one or more autonomous tentative. This conceptualization is grounded on theories and models of automatic assessment, formative assessment, and feedback. We discuss the effectiveness of the IF for engaging students from low socio-economic contexts in closing the gap between current and reference performance through a didactic experimentation involving 299 Italian students in grade 8. Using quantitative analyses on data from the automatic assessment, we compared the results of the first and last attempts in activities with and without IF, based on algorithmic parameters so that the task changes at every attempt. We found that IF was more effective than other kinds of activities to engage learners in actions aimed at improving their results, and the effects are stronger in low socio-economic contexts.","Barana, Alice Marchisio Marina Sacchet Matteo",Education Sciences,216,21

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Western Africa was defined in accordance with the United Nations' delineation and inclusive of 16 countries. A literature search for publications detailing the number of cobalt-60 machines (COs) and linear accelerators (LINACs) in radiotherapy centres was carried out. Population data from the World Bank Group and crude cancer rates from the International Agency for Research on Cancer were used to calculate ratios of million persons per MVM and MVMs per 1000 cancer cases. RESULTS: The numbers of MVMs in Western Africa in 1969, 1979, 1989, 1999 and 2009 were zero, two, three, six and nine, respectively. In 2019 there were 22 MVMs distributed across Ghana (five), Côte d'Ivoire (two), Mali (one), Mauritania (two), Nigeria (nine) and Senegal (three). Nine countries (56.3%) had no history of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). The largest increase in absolute EBRT capacity occurred from 2017 to 2019, during which 13 MVMs were commissioned. The largest decrease in EBRT capacity occurred from 2015 to 2017, during which four LINACs and three COs were rendered non-operational. The ratio of million persons per MVM improved from 67.0 in 1979 to 17.8 in 2019. As of 2019, there was 0.09 MVM per 1000 cancer cases. CONCLUSIONS: Western African nations have experienced an increase in the absolute number of MVMs and per capita radiotherapy capacity during the last 50 years, especially in the last decade. As non-functional LINACs contributed to a temporary decline in the EBRT infrastructure, dual use of CO/LINAC technologies may act to promote the availability of EBRT treatment in centres with capacity for multiple MVMs.","Taku, N; Polo, A; Zubizarreta, E H; Prasad, R R; Hopkins, K",Clin. oncol,216,13

The virus subsequently spread worldwide, causing havoc to medical systems and paralyzing global economies. The first COVID-19 patient in Israel was diagnosed on 27 February 2020. OBJECTIVES: To present our findings and experiences as the first and largest center for COVID-19 patients in Israel. METHODS: The current analysis included all COVID-19 patients treated in Sheba Medical Center from February 2020 to April 2020. Clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological data gathered during their hospitalization are presented. RESULTS: Our 162 patient cohort included mostly adult (mean age of 52 ± 20 years) males (65%). Patients classified as severe COVID-19 were significantly older and had higher prevalence of arterial hypertension and diabetes. They also had significantly higher white blood cell counts, absolute neutrophil counts, and lactate dehydrogenase. Low folic acid blood levels were more common amongst severe patients (18.2 vs. 12.9 vs. 9.8, P = 0.014). The rate of immune compromised patients (12%) in our cohort was also higher than in the general population. The rate of deterioration from moderate to severe disease was high: 9% necessitated non-invasive oxygenation and 15% were intubated and mechanically ventilated. The mortality rate was 3.1. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients present a challenge for healthcare professionals and the whole medical system.

To restrict the spread of the virus pandemic, the Government of India imposed a lockdown from 25 March 2020. In India, Kannur district was identified as the first ""hotspot"" of virus transmission and a ""triple-lockdown"" was implemented for a span of twenty days from 20 April 2020. This article highlights the variations of surface O3, NO, NO2, CO, SO2, NH3, VOC's, PM10, PM2.5 and meteorological parameters at the time of pre-lockdown, lockdown and triple-lockdown days at Kannur town in south India using ground-based analyzers. From pre-lockdown days to triple-lockdown days, surface O3 concentration was found to increase by 22% in this VOC limited environment. NO and NO2 concentrations were decreased by 61% and 71% respectively. The concentration of PM10 and PM2.5 were observed to decline significantly by 61% and 53% respectively. Reduction in PM10 during lockdown and triple-lockdown days enhanced the intensity of solar radiation reaching the lower troposphere, and increased air temperature and reduced the relative humidity. Owing to this, surface O3 production over Kannur was found to have increased during triple-lockdown days. The concentration of CO (67%), VOCs (61%), SO2 (62%) and NH3 (16%) were found to decrease significantly from pre-lockdown days to triple-lockdown days. The air quality index revealed that the air quality at the observational site was clean during the lockdown.","Resmi, C T; Nishanth, T; Satheesh Kumar, M K; Manoj, M G; Balachandramohan, M; Valsaraj, K T",PeerJ,216,1

METHODS: We conducted an Austrian-representative online survey (N = 1010) of self-reported life- and work-related changes during the first COVID-19 50-day mitigation period (March 16 through May 1 2020) compared to the situation before. We used multinominal logistic regression models to identify correlates of improved/decreased quality of life in the entire sample, and of improved/decreased productivity in a subsample of the working population (N = 686). We also calculated age- and multivariable-adjusted ORs and 95% CIs of an improved/decreased quality of life and an improved/decreased productivity by work from home status. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 mitigation period, quality of life improved in 17.5%, but decreased in 20.7% of the general Austrian population; perceived productivity at work increased in 12.7%, but decreased in 30.2% of the working population. Working from home during the mitigation period was associated with an increased quality of life (vs. none, partially: OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.09-3.91; all the time: 3.69, 1.86-7.29). In contrast, perceived productivity seemed to decrease when people worked from home (vs. none, partially: 1.42, 0.86-2.35; all the time: 1.48, 0.85-2.58).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Keywords were searched in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus and Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science, as well as the search engine of Google Scholar. Keywords were PCR, LAMP, RAA, RPA, Virus and COVID-19. RESULTS: LAMP technology has been extensively applied for the detection of human pathogenic bacteria, crop pests, pathogenic organisms and components in meat products. A new isotheral method, Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), can amplify the DNA as well as RPA. RPA has benefited from isothermal PCR and both simplicity and rapid amplification. Recombinase aided amplification (RAA) assay has been favorably used in the detection of bacterial and viral pathogens and solved the technical difficulties posed by DNA amplification methods because it does not need thermal denaturation of the template and employs at a low and constant temperature. CONCLUSIONS: Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, digital PCR, LAMP, nicking endonuclease amplification reaction, recombinase polymerase amplification, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats are different nucleic acid amplification tests of COVID-19.

Most RMDs lead to accelerated atherosclerosis and variable manifestations of the metabolic syndrome. Literature on COVID-19 in patients with RMDs, and the effects of various comorbidities on COVID-19 was reviewed. The initial data of COVID-19 infections in RMDs have not shown an increased risk for severe disease or the use of different immunosuppression. However, there are some emerging data that patients with RMDs and comorbidities may fare worse. Various meta-analyses have reiterated that pre-existing hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, lung disease or obesity predispose to increased COVID-19 mortality. All these comorbidities are commonly encountered in the various RMDs. Presence of comorbidities in RMDs pose a greater risk than the RMDs themselves. A risk score based on comorbidities in RMDs should be developed to predict severe COVID-19 and death. Additionally, there should be active management of such comorbidities to mitigate these risks.

The resultant civil unrest and demands for racial justice have spawned a global call for change. As a subset of a society that struggles with racism and other explicit biases, it is inescapable that some physicians and health-care employees will have the same explicit biases as the general population. Patients who receive care at academic medical centers interact with multiple individuals, some of whom may have explicit and implicit biases that influence patient care. In fact, multiple reports have documented that some physicians, health-care workers, and health professional students have negative biases based on race, ethnicity, obesity, religion, and sexual identity, among others. These biases can influence decision-making and aggravate health-care disparities and patient-physician mistrust. We review four actual cases from academic medical centers that illustrate how well-intended physicians and health-care workers can be influenced by bias and how this can put patients at risk. Strategies to mitigate bias are discussed and recommended. We introduce what we believe can be a powerful teaching tool: periodic ""bias and racism rounds"" in teaching hospitals, in which real patient interactions are reviewed critically to identify opportunities to reduce bias and racism and to attenuate the impact of bias and racism on patient outcomes.","Capers, Quinn; Bond, David A; Nori, Uday S",Chest,216,1

Some severe and critical cases have bad prognoses and high case fatality rates, unraveling risk factors for severe COVID-19 are of significance for predicting and preventing illness progression, and reducing case fatality rates. Our study focused on analyzing characteristics of COVID-19 cases and exploring risk factors for developing severe COVID-19. METHODS: The data for this study was disease surveillance data on symptomatic cases of COVID-19 reported from 30 provinces in China between January 19 and March 9, 2020, which included demographics, dates of symptom onset, clinical manifestations at the time of diagnosis, laboratory findings, radiographic findings, underlying disease history, and exposure history. We grouped mild and moderate cases together as non-severe cases and categorized severe and critical cases together as severe cases. We compared characteristics of severe cases and non-severe cases of COVID-19 and explored risk factors for severity. RESULTS: The total number of cases were 12 647 with age from less than 1 year old to 99 years old. The severe cases were 1662 (13.1%), the median age of severe cases was 57 years [Inter-quartile range(IQR): 46-68] and the median age of non-severe cases was 43 years (IQR: 32-54). The risk factors for severe COVID-19 were being male [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.2-1.5]; fever (aOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 2.0-2.7), cough (aOR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.2-1.6), fatigue (aOR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.2-1.5), and chronic kidney disease (aOR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.4-4.6), hypertension (aOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-1.8) and diabetes (aOR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.6-2.4). With the increase of age, risk for the severity was gradually higher [20-39 years (aOR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.8-8.4), 40-59 years (aOR = 7.6, 95% CI: 3.6-16.3), &#8805; 60 years (aOR = 20.4, 95% CI: 9.5-43.7)], and longer time from symtem onset to diagnosis [3-5 days (aOR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.2-1.7), 6-8 days (aOR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.5-2.1), &#8805; 9 days(aOR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.6-2.3)]. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed the risk factors for developing severe COVID-19 with large sample size, which included being male, older age, fever, cough, fatigue, delayed diagnosis, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney diasease, early case identification and prompt medical care. Based on these factors, the severity of COVID-19 cases can be predicted.

Second, using the remaining (pooled) policies, we estimate the effect of the best policy, accounting for the winner's curse.

The policy that has the largest impact (information hubs, SMS reminders, incentives that increase with each immunization) increases the number of immunizations by 44% relative to the status quo.

In the absence of effective treatments, the main containment strategy is to reduce the contagion by the isolation of infected individuals; however, isolation of unaffected individuals is highly undesirable. To help make rapid decisions on treatment and isolation needs, it would be useful to determine which features presented by suspected infection cases are the best predictors of a positive diagnosis. This can be done by analyzing patient characteristics, case trajectory, comorbidities, symptoms, diagnosis, and outcomes. We developed a model that employed supervised machine learning algorithms to identify the presentation features predicting COVID-19 disease diagnoses with high accuracy. Features examined included details of the individuals concerned, e.g., age, gender, observation of fever, history of travel, and clinical details such as the severity of cough and incidence of lung infection. We implemented and applied several machine learning algorithms to our collected data and found that the XGBoost algorithm performed with the highest accuracy (&gt;85%) to predict and select features that correctly indicate COVID-19 status for all age groups.

DESIGN: Test negative case-control study. SETTING: Community testing for covid-19 in England. PARTICIPANTS: 156 930 adults aged 70 years and older who reported symptoms of covid-19 between 8 December 2020 and 19 February 2021 and were successfully linked to vaccination data in the National Immunisation Management System. INTERVENTIONS: Vaccination with BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1-S. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were polymerase chain reaction confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, admissions to hospital for covid-19, and deaths with covid-19. RESULTS: Participants aged 80 years and older vaccinated with BNT162b2 before 4 January 2021 had a higher odds of testing positive for covid-19 in the first nine days after vaccination (odds ratio up to 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.77), indicating that those initially targeted had a higher underlying risk of infection. Vaccine effectiveness was therefore compared with the baseline post-vaccination period. Vaccine effects were noted 10 to 13 days after vaccination, reaching a vaccine effectiveness of 70% (95% confidence interval 59% to 78%), then plateauing. From 14 days after the second dose a vaccination effectiveness of 89% (85% to 93%) was found compared with the increased baseline risk. Participants aged 70 years and older vaccinated from 4 January (when ChAdOx1-S delivery commenced) had a similar underlying risk of covid-19 to unvaccinated individuals. With BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness reached 61% (51% to 69%) from 28 to 34 days after vaccination, then plateaued. With ChAdOx1-S, effects were seen from 14 to 20 days after vaccination, reaching an effectiveness of 60% (41% to 73%) from 28 to 34 days, increasing to 73% (27% to 90%) from day 35 onwards. On top of the protection against symptomatic disease, a further 43% (33% to 52%) reduced risk of emergency hospital admission and 51% (37% to 62%) reduced risk of death was observed in those who had received one dose of BNT162b2. Participants who had received one dose of ChAdOx1-S had a further 37% (3% to 59%) reduced risk of emergency hospital admission. Follow-up was insufficient to assess the effect of ChAdOx1-S on mortality. Combined with the effect against symptomatic disease, a single dose of either vaccine was about 80% effective at preventing admission to hospital with covid-19 and a single dose of BNT162b2 was 85% effective at preventing death with covid-19. CONCLUSION: Vaccination with either one dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1-S was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic covid-19 in older adults, and with further protection against severe disease. Both vaccines showed similar effects. Protection was maintained for the duration of follow-up (>6 weeks). A second dose of BNT162b2 was associated with further protection against symptomatic disease. A clear effect of the vaccines against the B.1.1.7 variant was found.","Lopez Bernal, Jamie; Andrews, Nick; Gower, Charlotte; Robertson, Chris; Stowe, Julia; Tessier, Elise; Simmons, Ruth; Cottrell, Simon; Roberts, Richard; O039,; Doherty, Mark; Brown, Kevin; Cameron, Claire; Stockton, Diane; McMenamin, Jim; Ramsay, Mary",BMJ,216,20

In this study, we developed a duplex, SYBR Green I-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to enable the simultaneous detection of DuCV and NGPV. The assay readily distinguished between the two viruses, based on their different melting temperatures (Tm), where the Tm for DuCV was 80â¯°C and that for NGPV was 84.5â¯°C. Other non-target duck viruses that were tested did not show melting peaks. The detection limit of the duplex assay was 101 copies/µL for both viruses. This method exhibited high repeatability and reproducibility, and both the inter-assay and intra-assay variation coefficients were <1.6%. Thirty-one fecal samples were collected for clinical testing using real-time PCR analysis, and the results were confirmed using sequencing. The rate of co-infection was 6.5%, which was consistent with the sequencing results.

Indeed, social distancing, masking, and education for patients and donors are major pillars of prevention. We recommend potential transplant recipients and donors to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 with qRT-PCR, serum antibody detection, and a lung CT scan pretransplant. If possible, stem cells from HLA-matched unrelated donors by local processing laboratories should be cryopreserved and shipped before initiating pretransplant conditioning. An alternative HLA-haplotype-matched related donor should be identified and evaluated as a backup. The interval immediately after discharge is the time of greatest risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection because of travel and exposure to infected persons. We recommend self-isolation and minimal contact with family members. Nonessential clinic visits should be deferred or substituted with telemedicine consultations if possible.

We place the “city” at the forefront of our analysis by bringing together the geographies of the “city” and “state,” together with a wider discussion of factors that may cause both the wounding of the city and an increase in the precariousness of the “island.” We apply this concept to the advanced city-island-state of Malta (Central Mediterranean), which is a densely populated, urbanised small island archipelago with about 500,000 inhabitants and operates as a single city with an urban core, suburbs, and a rural hinterland that is rapidly decreasing in size. This city-island-state is frequently considered as being “safe” from external geophysical, climatic, and anthropogenic wounding, but, in reality, Malta, as a city, an island, and an independent nation-state, is faced with multiple internal and external pressures that increase its precariousness and vulnerability to such externalities. Some of these are socio-economic, but others are environmental. We argue that the potential for wounding is particularly marked in Malta, that it is exacerbated by the contemporary globalised neoliberal world of flows and interconnectivities, and that this represents a multi-level wounding cascade: wounding the city wounds the island and, by extension, the state.

These patients often require specialized testing not available from commercial manufacturers and are therefore dependent on the laboratory to create, validate, and perform these assays. Recent paradigm-shifting legislation could alter the way that LDTs are operationalized and regulated. RECENT FINDINGS: On March 5th, 2020 the Verifying Accurate and Leading-Edge In-Vitro Clinical Tests Development Act (VALID) was introduced in the US Congress. This statute would overhaul existing regulatory framework by unifying the oversight of LDTs and commercial in-vitro diagnostic tests (IVDs) through the FDA. If enacted, LDTs would be subject to regulatory requirements like those found in commercial submissions for market review. Stakeholders continue to discuss the details and scope of the proposed legislation in the setting of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 pandemic, where LDTs are integral to the national COVID-19 response. SUMMARY: Congressional lawmakers have introduced legislation to alter the regulatory framework governing LDTs. Moving forward, a balance must be struck to ensure the availability of safe and accurate testing without delays or overregulation that could be harmful to patients. The downstream implications of how VALID and other legislation will impact laboratories, clinicians, and patients warrant close examination.","Clark, Andrew E; Levy, Jaclyn; Lee, Francesca M",Curr Opin Infect Dis,216,16

However, a substantial fraction of patients on dialysis belong to groups more likely to be hesitant about vaccination. METHODS: With the goal of identifying strategies to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake among patients on hemodialysis, we conducted a nationwide vaccine acceptability survey, partnering with a dialysis network to distribute an anonymized English and Spanish language online survey in 150 randomly selected facilities in the United States. We used logistic regression to evaluate characteristics of vaccine-hesitant persons. RESULTS: A total of 1515 (14% of eligible) patients responded;20% of all responders, 29% of patients aged 18-44 years, and 29% of Black responders reported being hesitant to seek the COVID-19 vaccine, even if the vaccine was considered safe for the general population. Odds of vaccine hesitancy were higher among patients aged 18-44 years versus those 45-64 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.5;95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.0 to 2.3), Black patients versus non-Hispanic White patients (OR, 1.9;95% CI, 1.3 to 2.7), Native Americans or Pacific Islanders versus non-Hispanic White patients (OR, 2.0;95% CI, 1.1 to 3.7), and women versus men (OR, 1.6;95% CI, 1.2 to 2.0). About half (53%) of patients who were vaccine hesitant expressed concerns about side effects. Responders' main information sources about COVID-19 vaccines were television news and dialysis staff (68% and 38%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of patients receiving in-center hemodialysis in the United States are hesitant about seeking COVID-19 vaccination. Facilitating uptake requires outreach to younger patients, women, and Black, Native American, or Pacific Islander patients, and addressing concerns about side effects.","Garcia, P.; Montez-Rath, M.

BACKGROUND: The experience of being a newly qualified nurse is stressful and isolating. Support from colleagues and peers can enhance perceptions of competence and confidence in newly qualified nurses, improve well-being and aid retention. However, despite initiatives such as preceptorship, support needs may remain unmet in busy clinical environments. Online support has potential to offer a partial solution to professional isolation, but there is a lack of research into how technology can support nurses' emotional and social well-being. DESIGN: A qualitative exploratory study was designed, employing semi-structured focus groups, analysed using thematic analysis. The study is reported in accordance with the COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research checklist. METHODS: Eight focus groups, supplemented by one individual interview, were conducted with newly qualified nurses between June 2018-January 2019. FINDINGS: Two main themes arose. The first was Drowning, a lot of the time with two sub-themes: (i) Feelings and emotions about being a Newly Qualified Nurse: 'Absolutely terrified' and (ii) Support within the role: 'Somebody you can count on'. The second was Potential advantages and disadvantages of online modality: 'Somebody is going to get in that phone!' which included three sub-themes (i) Potential advantages, (ii) Potential disadvantages and (iii) Preferences and recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that if barriers can be overcome, then online support has potential to contribute to newly qualified nurses' well-being. Further research is needed to explore technical and ethical issues around online support and evaluate its effectiveness for newly qualified nurses. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Online support has the potential to add to existing strategies to support nurses during stressful times. This may be particularly relevant when many staff are working under increased pressure due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jenkins, Catharine; Oyebode, Jan; Bicknell, Sarah; Webster, Natalie; Bentham, Peter; Smythe, Analisa",J. clin. nurs,216,16

While different containment policies using nonpharmaceutical interventions have been applied, their time evolution and efficiency are not known quantitatively. We show here that the measure of the doubling time Td(t) is a reliable tool for early predictions of epidemic spread time evolution following mitigation, which is needed for planning methods to overcome critical health care need. The doubling time Td(t) curves over the epidemic dome full time width provide a quantitative measure of the success of different containment measures. The efficiency of the Lockdown case Finding mobile Tracing (LFT) policy using modern technologies is found to be much higher than the traditional Lockdown Stop and Go (LSG) policy using the success s factor. A low s factor, the characteristic time of the exponential growing Td(t) in the arrested regime, was reached by LFT policy giving the lowest number of deaths and the shorter time width of the epidemic dome. The record for the largest number of fatalities in USA is correlated with the largest s factor in the near threshold regime when any containment measures were enforced by government in due time. LFT policy has been able to reduce both intensity and time width of the Covid-19 pandemic dome achieving both a low number of fatalities and lower economic losses.","Bianconi, Antonio; Marcelli, Augusto; Campi, Gaetano; Perali, Andrea",Phys. biol,216,24

Dysfunctional microvascular pericytes are characterized by their location in the neurovascular unit, either on the arteriole or venule side. Pathophysiological and pathological changes caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include pulmonary hypertension, edema, focal hemorrhage, microvascular congestion, and thrombosis. In this paper, I have extended the application of the pericytes-centered hypothesis to COVID-19 by proposing the concept of a pulmonary neurovascular unit (pNVU); application of this concept implies that human lungs contain approximately 300 million pNVUs. This concept of existing local regulation of microvascular blood flow is supported by the observation of pathophysiology in pulmonary embolism and in acute high-altitude illness. The autonomic control seen in these three disease states matches blood flow with oxygen supply in each pNVU to maintain physiological blood oxygen saturation level. Here, I illustrate how the malfunction of microvascular pericytes may cause focal hemorrhage, edema or microvascular congestion and thrombosis. A bypass existing in each pNVU would autonomically deviate blood flow from a COVID-19-affected pNVU to other healthy pNVUs. This action would prevent systemically applied medicines from reaching the therapeutic threshold in COVID-19- affected pNVUs. While testing this hypothesis with experimental evidence is urgently needed, supporting therapy aimed at improving microcirculation or rebuilding the physiological function of microvascular pericytes is recommended as a potentially effective treatment of COVID 19.","He, Zhen",Current neurovascular research (Online),216,21

Here, we describe a stepwise engineering approach to generate a set of affinity optimized, enzymatically inactivated ACE2 variants that potently block SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells. These optimized receptor traps tightly bind the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein and prevent entry into host cells. We first computationally designed the ACE2-RBD interface using a two-stage flexible protein backbone design process that improved affinity for the RBD by up to 12-fold. These designed receptor variants were affinity matured an additional 14-fold by random mutagenesis and selection using yeast surface display. The highest-affinity variant contained seven amino acid changes and bound to the RBD 170-fold more tightly than wild-type ACE2. With the addition of the natural ACE2 collectrin domain and fusion to a human immunoglobulin crystallizable fragment (Fc) domain for increased stabilization and avidity, the most optimal ACE2 receptor traps neutralized SARS-CoV-2-pseudotyped lentivirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) in the 10- to 100-ng/mL range. Engineered ACE2 receptor traps offer a promising route to fighting infections by SARS-CoV-2 and other ACE2-using coronaviruses, with the key advantage that viral resistance would also likely impair viral entry. Moreover, such traps can be predesigned for viruses with known entry receptors for faster therapeutic response without the need for neutralizing antibodies isolated from convalescent patients.","Glasgow, Anum; Glasgow, Jeff; Limonta, Daniel; Solomon, Paige; Lui, Irene; Zhang, Yang; Nix, Matthew A; Rettko, Nicholas J; Zha, Shoshana; Yamin, Rachel; Kao, Kevin; Rosenberg, Oren S; Ravetch, Jeffrey V; Wiita, Arun P; Leung, Kevin K; Lim, Shion A; Zhou, Xin X; Hobman, Tom C; Kortemme, Tanja; Wells, James A",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,216,16

Thus, we assessed occurrence and effects of infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on patients on the Swiss national waiting list for solid organ transplantation. METHODS: Patient data were retrospectively extracted from the Swiss Organ Allocation System (SOAS). From 16 March to 31 May 2020, we included all patients listed for solid organ transplantation on the Swiss national waiting list who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Severity of COVID-19 was categorised as follows: stage I, mild symptoms; stage II, moderate to severe symptoms; stage III, critical symptoms; stage IV, death. We compared the incidence rate (laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2), the hospital admission rate (number of admissions of SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals), and the case fatality rate (number of deaths of SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals) in our study population with the general Swiss population during the study period, calculating age-adjusted standardised incidence ratios and standardised mortality ratios, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: A total of 1439 patients were registered on the Swiss national solid organ transplantation waiting list on 31 May 31 2020. Twenty-four (1.7%) waiting list patients were reported to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the study period. The median age was 56 years (interquartile range 45.3&ndash;65.8), and 14 (58%) were male. Of all patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, two patients were asymptomatic, 14 (58%) presented in COVID-19 stage I, 3 (13%) in stage II, and 5 (21%) in stage III. Eight patients (33%) were admitted to hospital, four (17%) required intensive care, and three (13%) mechanical ventilation. Twenty-two patients (92%) of all those infected recovered, but two male patients aged &gt;65 years with multiple comorbidities died in hospital from respiratory failure. Comparing our study population with the general Swiss population, the age-adjusted standardised incidence ratio was 4.1 (95% CI 2.7&ndash;6.0). CONCLUSION: The overall rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections in candidates awaiting solid organ transplantation was four times higher than in the Swiss general population; however, the frequency of testing likely played a role. Given the small sample size of affected patients, conclusions have to be drawn cautiously and results need verification in larger cohorts.","Benden, Christian; Haile, Sarah; Kruegel, Nathalie; Beyeler, Franziska; Aubert, John-David; Binet, Isabelle; Golshayan, Déla; Hadaya, Karine; Mueller, Thomas; Parvex, Paloma; Immer, Franz",Swiss Med Wkly,216,16

Shear wave elastography (SWE) is potentially a method of choice for detecting peripheral nerve involvement. PURPOSE: To compare the degree of thickening and nerve elasticity of brachial plexus (BP) nerve roots and evaluate the usefulness of sonoelastography in patients with clinically diagnosed MS without brachial plexopathy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients with MS and 32 controls were included in the study. Bilateral C5, C6, and C7 mean nerve root diameters, and mean elasticity values in kiloPascal (kPa) were measured in the patient and control groups. The relationship between the age, height, and weight values and nerve diameter-elasticity values of the patient and control groups was compared. RESULTS: The elasticity values of the C5 and C6 nerve roots were increased, and the nerve root thickness was decreased in the MS group compared to that in the control (P < 0.05). There was no difference between the C7 mean nerve root elasticity (kPa) and diameter measurements in the patient and control groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study showed an increase in the BP nerve root elasticity values (kPa) in patients with MS compared to that of the control group and a decrease in diameter values thought to be related to the possible chronic atrophic process. The results are consistent with the demyelinating process of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) due to MS.","Gürün, Enes; Akdulum, Ismail; Akyüz, Melih; Oktar, Suna Özhan",Acta Radiol,216,1

Specifically, immunosuppression and COPD are two important risk factors. This case report describes the rehabilitation course of a 62-year-old female with a history of a double lung transplant for COPD in 2016 who contracted a severe COVID-19 infection. After nearly a month in the intensive care unit she underwent a 10-day course of inpatient rehabilitation and regained substantial independence and was able to return home only needing supervision. While other cases in the rehabilitation literature have documented successful rehabilitation following COVID-19 infection, this transplant related case required intensive coordination of care to meet goals and achieve success for our patient. Due to the limited numbers of studies, this information may prove valuable in future considerations for candidates of inpatient rehabilitation.","Nicolosi, C; Barber, K; Draganich, C; Niehaus, W",Am. j. phys. med. rehabilit,216,5

This is due to the vulnerability of health and economic systems, coupled with the high burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), and malaria. Here we examine the potential implications of COVID-19 on the control of these major epidemic diseases in Africa. We use current evidence on disease burden of HIV, TB, and malaria, and epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 in Africa, retrieved from the literature. Our analysis shows that the current measures to control COVID-19 neglect important and complex context-specific epidemiological, social, and economic realities in Africa. There is a similarity of clinical features of TB and malaria, with those used to track COVID-19 cases. This coupled with institutional mistrust and misinformation might result in many patients with clinical features similar to those of COVID-19 being hesitant to voluntarily seek care in a formal health facility. Furthermore, most people in productive age in Africa work in the informal sector, and most of those in the formal sector are underemployed. With the current measures to control COVID-19, these populations might face unprecedented difficulties to access essential services, mainly due to reduced ability of patients to support direct and indirect medical costs, and unavailability of transportation means to reach health facilities. Therefore, if not accompanied with appropriate economic and epidemiological considerations, we anticipate that these measures might result in unprecedented difficulties among vulnerable segments of society to access essential services, including antiretroviral and prophylactic drugs among people living with HIV and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, anti-tuberculosis drugs, and curative and preventive treatments for malaria among pregnant women and children. This might increase the propensity of patients taking substandard doses and/or medicines, which has the potential to compromise drug efficacy, and worsen health inequalities in the region. COVID-19 responses at country level should include measures to protect vulnerable and under-served segments of society.","Amimo, Floriano; Lambert, Ben; Magit, Anthony",Trop. Med. Health,216,28

However, their role in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate disease is less clear. The inhaled corticosteroid ciclesonide has shown early promise as a potential treatment for COVID-19. ObjectiveTo determine whether the inhaled steroid ciclesonide is efficacious in patients with high risk for disease progression and can reduce the incidence of long-term COVID-19 symptoms or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. DesignThis was a phase III, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of ciclesonide metered-dose inhaler (MDI) for the treatment of non-hospitalized participants with symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Patients were screened from June 11, 2020 to November 3, 2020. SettingThe study was conducted at 10 centers throughout the U.S. public and private, academic and non-academic sites were represented among the centers. ParticipantsParticipants were randomly assigned to ciclesonide MDI 160 {micro}g per actuation, two actuations twice a day (total daily dose 640 {micro}g) or placebo for 30 days. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary endpoint was time to alleviation of all COVID-19 related symptoms (cough, dyspnea, chills, feeling feverish, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell) by Day 30. Secondary endpoints included subsequent emergency department visits or hospital admissions for reasons attributable to COVID-19. Results413 participants were screened and 400 (96.9%) were enrolled and randomized (197 in the ciclesonide arm and 203 in the placebo arm). The median time to alleviation of all COVID-19-related symptoms was 19.0 days (95% CI: 14.0, 21.0) in the ciclesonide arm and 19.0 days (95% CI: 16.0, 23.0) in the placebo arm. There was no difference in resolution of all symptoms by Day 30 (odds ratio [OR] 1.28, 95% CI: 0.84, 1.97). Participants treated with ciclesonide had fewer subsequent emergency department visits or hospital admissions for reasons attributable to COVID-19 (OR 0.18, 95% CI: 0.04 - 0.85). No subjects died during the study. Conclusions and RelevanceCiclesonide did not achieve the primary efficacy endpoint of time to alleviation of all COVID-19-related symptoms. Future studies of inhaled steroids are needed to explore their efficacy in patients with high risk for disease progression and in reducing the incidence of long-term COVID-19 symptoms or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2.

Most frontline healthcare professionals have never witnessed anything like this before. As a result, staff may experience numerous and continuous traumatic events, which in many instances, will negatively affect their psychological well-being. Particularly, nurses face extraordinary challenges in response to shifting protocols, triage, shortages of resources, and the astonishing numbers of patients who require care in expedited time constraints. As most healthcare workers are passionate nursing professionals, frustration and often a sense of powerlessness occur when they find themselves unable to provide needed care to their patients. The overwhelming number of deaths, patients isolated and dying alone, and the ever-present fear of being infected and then infecting colleagues, family, friends due to the lack of protective gear or known protocols takes its toll on emotional and psychological well-being. For nurses, the experience of this significant (hopefully once-in-a-lifetime) event can inflict on-going moral injury. Nurses affected by this trauma require education, coping tools, and therapy to help avoid or alleviate the adverse effects on their well-being. Institutions must provide these resources to tend to the well-being of their healthcare staff, during and beyond the pandemic.

METHODS: Sagittal reconstructed computed tomography (CT) images of the lumbar spine in consecutive patients (n=581) undergoing CT scans of abdominal or lumbar regions for reasons other than low back disorders were obtained; lumbar lordosis (LL), L5-S1 angle, and sacral slope (SS) were measured. Lumbopelvic parameters in patients with or without spondylolysis were evaluated in three age groups (<50, 50-69, and &#8805;70). The influence of bilateral L5 spondylolysis (L5-lysis) and L5 vertebral slip on each lumbopelvic parameter, and correlation between cross-sectional area (CSA) of paraspinal muscles and the degree of vertebral slip were examined by multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Patients with bilateral spondylolysis showed greater LL and SS than patients without spondylolysis. When analyzing the influence of L5-lysis, only elderly patients (&#8805;70) with L5-lysis showed significantly greater LL and SS than non-spondylolysis (non-lysis) patients. L5-lysis patients more frequently showed L5 vertebral slip than non-lysis patients and smaller L5-S1 angle was observed when L5 vertebral slip accompanied L5-lysis. The degree of vertebral slip was significantly correlated with CSA of psoas muscles, but not with CSA of paraspinal extensor muscles. CONCLUSIONS: When patients have L5-lysis, lumbar lordosis and pelvic anteversion occurred age-dependently. In elderly patients with L5-lysis, L5 vertebral slip with decrease of L5-S1 angle frequently occurs. The progression of vertebral slip was correlated with atrophy of psoas muscles, but not that of paraspinal extensor muscles.","Aoki, Yasuchika; Kubota, Go; Inoue, Masahiro; Takahashi, Hiroshi; Watanabe, Atsuya; Nakajima, Takayuki; Sato, Yusuke; Nakajima, Arata; Saito, Junya; Eguchi, Yawara; Orita, Sumihisa; Fukuchi, Hiroyuki; Sakai, Takayuki; Ochi, Shigehiro; Yanagawa, Noriyuki; Nakagawa, Koichi; Ohtori, Seiji",World neurosurgery (Online),216,30

To our knowledge, no research has previously been conducted on any self-help intervention derived from eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy. In this study, we evaluated the mental health status of children not directly affected by the pandemic and investigated the effects of using an EMDR-derived self-help intervention in children as a low-intensity treatment. The mental health status of 178 children was evaluated online via the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) and Childhood Posttraumatic Stress Reaction Index (CPTS-RI). Then, children were randomly assigned to intervention and waitlist. A booklet containing EMDR-derived techniques was sent via the school online portal and the intervention was conducted. Posttests were administered 4 weeks later. The attrition rate was 45.5%, with 97 children completing the trial (intervention: 52;waitlist: 45). At baseline, 76.4% of children showed posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) above threshold. Results showed a statistically significant decrease in the posttest PTSS scores for the intervention group compared to waitlist. The intervention group had significant pre–post improvement on all but one subscale, while the waitlist group showed a significant increase in state anxiety on the STAIC. In conclusion, posttraumatic stress was found to be high in children during the COVID-19 outbreak period, and EMDR-derived self-help intervention appeared to be an effective psychosocial intervention tool. © Copyright 2021 EMDR International Association.","Karadag, M.; Topal, Z.; Ezer, R.

The pandemic has changed how individuals live and work, and in particular, frontline healthcare professionals have been exposed to alarming levels of stress. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to understand the professional and personal effects of COVID-19 pandemic on surgeons working in the UK National Health Service (NHS). SETTING: Surgical departments in the NHS. DESIGN: Between May and July 2020, as part of an ongoing study, we asked surgeons two open-ended questions: 'What challenges are the COVID-19 crisis currently presenting to you in your work and home life?' and 'How is this stress affecting you personally?' Thematic analysis was used for the qualitative data. Responses to the second question were also categorised into four groups reflecting valence: positive, neutral, mildly negative and strongly negative. RESULTS: A total of 141 surgeons responded to the survey and the results indicated that 85.8% reported that they were generally negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, of which 7.8% were strongly affected in a negative way. Qualitative thematic analysis identified four key themes from responses relating to the impact of the pandemic: (1) changing and challenging work environment as a result of COVID-19; (2) challenges to professional life and development; (3) management of change and loss in the respondents' personal lives; (4) emotional and psychological impacts. CONCLUSION: The results highlighted the substantial emotional and psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgeons' mental health, particularly in relation to fear and anxiety, loss of motivation, low mood, stress and burnout. There is an urgent need for workplace support and mental health interventions to help surgeons cope with the difficulties they face during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Al-Ghunaim, Tmam Abdulaziz; Johnson, Judith; Biyani, Chandra Shekhar; O039,; Connor, Daryl",BMJ Open,216,16

Workers screening for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection have a high risk of not only occupational exposure to the virus but also sleep disorders. However, the job-related factors associated with reduced sleep quality remain unclear. METHODS: All healthcare workers temporarily scheduled to screen the 2019-nCoV patients were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire that included questions on demographics, job-related factors, and sleep quality as assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Sleep quality was assessed over a one-month follow-up period. RESULTS: A total of 116 doctors and 99 nurses were recruited for this study. The total scheduled work time was 14.78 ± 6.69 days during follow-up. Some job-related factors, such as number of work days, years of work experience, and subjective psychological stress, were associated with changes in the PSQI score. During the study, some workers tried out cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for sleep disorders using methods that were available online and easily accessible. Adopting online CBT was shown to be associated with scores of components of sleep quality, sleep latency, and sleep disturbance (ß = -0.152, P = 0.01; ß = -0.175, P = 0.008; and ß = -0.158, P = 0.011, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers involved in screening for 2019-nCoV experienced reduced sleep quality, and a reasonable work schedule may help with maintaining sleep quality. In addition, interventions for healthcare workers should target self-help sleep assistance.","Zhao, Xiaolong; Zhang, Tong; Li, Bin; Yu, Xiaoxu; Ma, Zhiyue; Cao, Luhong; Gu, Qingjia; Dong, Chuan; Jin, Yunhua; Fan, Jiangang; He, Gang",Sleep Med,216,22

RESULTS: Six guidelines were identified: (a) capitalize on fast track review and reporting processes; (b) prioritize accessibility during sample specification and selection; (c) optimize recruitment and retention strategies; (d) maximize current and future data use through strategic research design; (e) tailor data collection to participants' characteristics, preferences, and priorities; and (f) incorporate timeline mapping of personal and contemporaneous phenomena. DISCUSSION: Public health measures taken to slow disease spread during the current COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises may slow the pace of research and make its implementation all the more challenging. However, just-in-time qualitative research advances our understanding of the human experience and response to the COVID-19 and major public health crises. It also complements existing behavioral theory and research. The guidelines presented may assist researchers to initiate necessary qualitative research more rapidly, with fewer logistic challenges, and with methodological rigor. They may also help expand research on groups experiencing collateral effects of the pandemic and major public health crisis. Lastly, the guidelines may support the development of more robust data for alternate analysis at a later date.","Jairath, Nalini N; Benetato, Bonnie B; O039,; Brien, Sandra L; Griffin Agazio, Janice B",Nurs Res,216,33

Seven-day Consultant presence and morning AMU discharges have been advocated to improve hospital bed management. AIMS: To determine whether a later time of daily peak AMU occupancy correlates with measures of hospital stress; whether seven-day Consultant presence, for COVID-19, abolished weekly periodicity of discharges. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. METHODS: Anonymised AMU admission and discharge times were retrieved from the Profile Information Management System (PIMS), at a large, urban hospital from 14th April 2014-31st December 2018 and 20th March-2nd May 2020 (COVID-19 peak). Minute-by-minute admission and discharge times were combined to construct a running total of AMU bed occupancy. Fourier transforms were used to determine periodicity. We tested association between i) average AMU occupancy and ii) time of peak AMU occupancy, with measures of hospital stress (total medical bed occupancy and 'medical outliers' on non-medical wards). RESULTS: Daily, weekly and seasonal patterns of AMU bed occupancy were evident. Timing of AMU peak occupancy was unrelated to each measure of hospital stress: total medical inpatients (Spearman's rho, rs=0.04, P = 0.24); number of medical outliers (rs=-0.06, P = 0.05). During COVID-19, daily bed occupancy was similar, with continuation of greater Friday and Monday discharges than the weekend. CONCLUSIONS: Timing of peak AMU occupancy did not alter with hospital stress. Efforts to increase morning AMU discharges are likely to have little effect on hospital performance. Seven-day Consultant presence did not abolish weekly periodicity of discharges - other factors influence weekend discharges.","Dauncey, S J; Kelly, P A; Baykov, D; Skeldon, A C; Whyte, M B",QJM,216,6

Emerging evidence has suggested a link between the infection and gut microbiome status. This is one of the several factors that may contribute towards severity of infection. Given the fact that the gut is heavily linked to immunity, inflammatory status and the ability to challenge pathogens, it is worthwhile to consider dietary intervention of the gut microbiota as means of potentially challenging the viral outcome. In this context, probiotics and prebiotics have been used to mitigate similar respiratory infections.

The self-administered Italian version questionnaire was created using Google Forms and posted on chats and social networks.The mood of participants before and during the quarantine was assessed using a scale from 1 to 10 (1 = no wellbeing; 10 = total wellbeing). Couples' quality of life and their reproductive desire were evaluated.Results: 1482 respondents were included: 944 women (63.7%) and 538 men (36.3%). A significant trend toward reduced mean wellbeing scores during the quarantine, compared to before, was found (p < .01).

This study sought to gain insight into the impact of the current situation on people with MS and the factors that influence this. METHODS: 324 MS patients participated in this online cross-sectional survey during the COVID-19 lockdown period. A mixed methods design was used, with quantitative information collected on MS-related factors as well as COVID-19 impact and an open-ended, qualitative response looking for reasons behind the self-reported COVID-19 impact. RESULTS: We found that 48% of the participants reported that COVID-19 had a neutral impact on their lives and 16% reported a positive impact. However, 36% reported a negative impact, and had greater levels of MS- and non-MS-related worries, and higher levels of bother related to psychological and cognitive symptoms and fatigue than the groups reporting a neutral or positive impact. Significant predictors of this adversely affected group were age, type of MS and presence of psychological symptoms. Antidepressant medication use, time since diagnosis, gender, location, living arrangements or employment status did not predict impact. Open-ended responses explaining personal COVID-19 impact indicate that coping strategies may contribute to these findings. In particular, active, problem-focused approaches were reported by the majority of people who reported a positive impact, as well as a third of those who reported a neutral impact. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that younger people, those with progressive types of MS, and those with psychological symptoms are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of a COVID-19 pandemic induced lockdown. Coping strategies provide further insight into these findings with those reporting active problem-focused approaches seemingly faring better than those who do not state any coping strategies. These results also have implications for understanding other like neurological conditions that share many similarities with MS and how best to direct support.","Morris-Bankole, Hannah; Ho, Aileen K",Neurol Ther,216,1

METHODS: The self-quarantine programme and pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 PCR screening were initiated for patients who were scheduled for admission later than 7 May 2020 for elective orthopaedic surgery on admission. On the day of admission, the patients declared compliance with self-quarantine regulations. The admission was refused in cases of non-compliance. After admission, the patients underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR screening. If PCR results were negative, isolation was terminated. If PCR results were positive, the surgery was postponed. If the patients had symptoms suspicious of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) after surgery, the PCR test was repeated. RESULTS: Overall, 308 patients (age: 63.2 ± 18.8 years, 197 female and 111 male) were scheduled for elective orthopaedic surgery. Two patients did not agree with the requirements of self-quarantine, and two other procedures were cancelled. No non-compliance was reported; thus, the completion rate of the self-quarantine programme was 304/308 (98.7%). Finally, 304 patients underwent PCR testing, and there were no positive PCR results. After cancellations of four operations due to reasons other than COVID-19, 300 surgical procedures were performed. No patients developed COVID-19 during hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: Although this system is based on trusting the good behaviour of patients, accompanied by PCR screening, we believe that the results showed the efficacy of the system in safely performing orthopaedic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nishitani, Kohei; Nagao, Miki; Matsuda, Shuichi",Int. orthop,216,20

We aimed to investigate the prevalence and the correlates with the occurrence of PE as well as the association between PE and the risk of mortality in COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective multicenter study on consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized at 7 Italian Hospitals. At admission, all patients underwent medical history, laboratory and echocardiographic evaluation. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 224 patients (mean age 69 ± 14, male sex 62%); PE was diagnosed in 32 cases (14%). Patients with PE were hospitalized after a longer time since symptoms onset (7 IQR 3-11 days, 3 IQR 1-6 days; p = 0.001) and showed higher D-dimers level (1819 IQR 568-5017 ng/ml vs 555 IQR 13-1530 ng/ml; p < 0.001) and higher prevalence of myocardial injury (47% vs 28%, p = 0.033).

Mortality rates (50% vs 27%; p = 0.010) and cardiogenic shock (37% vs 14%; p = 0.001) were significantly higher in PE as compared with non-PE patients. At multivariate analysis PE was significant associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: PE is relatively common complication in COVID-19 and is associated with increased mortality risk.

Participants aged 23 to 38 years had the greatest effect of COVID-19 on their purchasing decision of healthier foods, while participants in the age groups 55-73 and 74-91 were least affected. The amount of foods purchased during the pandemic decreased with increasing age. The amount of foods purchased by students, people in employment, and people from minority ethnic groups were greatly affected by the pandemic. All participants who stated that taking food supplements is not important during the pandemic were from the White ethnic group. The effects of the pandemic on purchasing healthier foods were greater in younger generations and participants in full- or part-time employment than participants who were retired and who were aged above 55. The participants with higher educational qualifications and those from minority ethnic groups were also more affected by the pandemic. We suggest further studies to monitor any changes in the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the eating and purchasing behaviours of consumers.","Ogundijo, Daniel A; Tas, Ayten A; Onarinde, Bukola A",Nutrients,216,1

Here, a family of degradable tough adhesive hydrogels containing &#8776;90% water by incorporating covalently networked degradable crosslinkers and hydrolyzable ionically crosslinked main-chain polymers is developed. Mechanical toughness, adhesion, and degradation of these new formulations are tested in both accelerated in vitro conditions and up to 16 weeks in vivo. These degradable tough adhesives are engineered with equivalent mechanical and adhesive properties to nondegradable tough adhesives, capable of achieving stretches >20 times their initial length, fracture energies >6 kJ m-2 , and adhesion energies >1000 J m-2 . All degradable systems show complete degradation within 2 weeks under accelerated aging conditions in vitro and weeks to months in vivo depending on the degradable crosslinker selected. Excellent biocompatibility is observed for all groups after 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks of implantation, with minimal fibrous encapsulation and no signs of organ toxicity. On-demand removal of the adhesive is achieved with treatment of chemical agents which do not cause damage to underlying skin tissue in mice. The broad versatility of this family of adhesives provides the foundation for numerous in vivo indications.","Freedman, Benjamin R; Uzun, Oktay; Luna, Nadja M Maldonado; Rock, Anna; Clifford, Charles; Stoler, Emily; Östlund-Sholars, Gabrielle; Johnson, Christopher; Mooney, David J",Adv Mater,216,20

We sought to understand the longer-term effects of the pandemic on blood usage via changes in case volume and clinical intensity as well as whether the blood needs of COVID-19-positive patients differed from other transfused patients. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A single-center retrospective study of blood use in 2020 as compared to 2014-2019 was conducted at a tertiary care center. Statistical analysis was performed in an R-based workflow. p values are reported using two-sided t-tests for total hospital blood usage and using Mann-Whitney U tests for comparisons of patient blood usage. RESULTS: Mean monthly red cell usage in 2020 decreased by 11.2% (p = .003), plasma usage decreased by 23.8%, (p < .001) platelet usage decreased by 11.4% (p < .001), and monthly cryoprecipitate use increased by 18% (p = .03). A linear regression model predicted significant associations between total blood usage and the year, number of Medicare eligible discharges, and Case Mix Index. COVID-19-positive patients requiring at least one blood product did not use significantly different amounts of red cells, plasma, or platelets from all other transfused patients. CONCLUSIONS: Year 2020 began with decreased blood usage that was normalized by late spring. Reassuringly, transfused COVID-19-positive patients in general and those requiring ICU level care do not use significantly increased amounts of blood as compared to similar transfused hospital patients.","Murphy, Colin; Fontaine, Magali; Luethy, Paul; McGann, Heather; Jackson, Bryon",Transfusion,216,15

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether point-of-care (POC) PCR testing can be used to reduce staff sick days and improve diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. METHODS: Using a cross-over design, the cobas® Liat® Influenza A/B POC PCR test (Liat) was compared with standard clinical practice during the 2019/2020 influenza season. All adult patients (aged &#8805; 18 years) with fever (&#8805;38°C) and respiratory symptoms were included. Primary end points were the prevalence of influenza infections in the ED and staff sick days. Secondary end points were frequency of antiviral and antibacterial therapy, time between admission and test result or treatment initiation, patient disposition, ED length of stay (LOS), and for inpatients mortality and LOS. Nurses were interviewed about handling and integration of POC testing. The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infections coincided with the second half of the study. RESULTS: A total of 828 patients were enrolled in the study. All 375 patients of the intervention group were tested with Liat, and 103 patients of them (27.6%) tested positive. During the intervention period, staff sick days were reduced by 34.4% (P = .023). Significantly, more patients in the intervention group received antiviral therapy with neuraminidase inhibitors (7.2% vs 3.8%, P = .028) and tested patients received antibiotics more frequently (40.0% vs 31.6%, P = .033). Patients with POC test were transferred to external hospitals significantly more often (5.6% vs 1.3%, P = .01). CONCLUSION: We conclude that POC testing for influenza is useful in the ED, especially if it is heavily frequented by patients with respiratory symptoms.","Perlitz, Benjamin; Slagman, Anna; Hitzek, Jennifer; Riedlinger, Dorothee; Möckel, Martin",Influenza other respir. viruses,216,20

Following the 2014-2016 Ebola Crisis, sophisticated transport solutions have been developed, mostly utilizing large civilian and military airframes and the patient treated in a large isolation chamber. In the present COVID-19 pandemic, however, many services offer aeromedical transport of patients with highly-infectious diseases in much smaller portable medical isolation units (PMIU), with the medical team on the outside, delivering care through portholes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of all transports of patients with proven or suspected COVID-19 disease, transported by Jetcall, Idstein, Germany, between April 1 and August 1, 2020, using a PMIU (EpiShuttle, EpiGuard AS, Oslo, Norway). Demographics and medical data were analyzed using the services' standardized transport protocols. Transport-associated challenges and optimization strategies were identified by interviewing and debriefing all transport teams after each transport. Results: Thirteen patients with COVID-19 have been transported in a PMIU over distances up to 7,400 kilometers (km), with flight times ranging from 02:15 hours to 11:10 hours. We identified the main limitations of PMIU transports as limited access to the patient and reduced manual dexterity when delivering care through the porthole gloves and disconnection of lines and tubes during loading and unloading procedures. Technical solutions such as bluetooth-enabled stethoscopes, cordless ultrasound scanners and communication devices, meticulous preparation of the PMIU and the patient following standardized protocols and scenario-based training of crew members can reduce some of the risks. Discussion: Transporting a patient with COVID-19 or any other highly infectious disease in a PMIU is a feasible option even over long distances, but adding a significant layer of additional risk, thus requiring a careful and individualized risk-benefit analysis for each patient prior to transport.","Schwabe, Dirk; Kellner, Bernhard; Henkel, Dirk; Pilligrath, Heinz Jürgen; Krummer, Stefanie; Zach, Sascha; Rohrbeck, Cornelia; Diefenbach, Michael; Veldman, Alex",Open Access Emerg Med,216,16

However, the significant heterogeneity and less critical outcomes of such trials may be leading to a waste of research resources. This study aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials on COVID-19 in order to tackle the outcome issues. The study was conducted according to the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) handbook (version 1.0), a guideline for COS development. A research group was set up that included experts in respiratory and critical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, clinical pharmacology, and statistics, in addition to medical journal editors. Clinical trial registry websites (chictr.org.cn and clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to retrieve clinical trial protocols and outcomes in order to form an outcome pool. A total of 78 clinical trial protocols on COVID-19 were included and 259 outcomes were collected. After standardization, 132 outcomes were identified within seven different categories, of which 58 were selected to develop a preliminary outcome list for further consensus. After two rounds of Delphi survey and one consensus meeting, the most important outcomes for the different clinical classifications of COVID-19 were identified and determined to constitute the COS for clinical trials on COVID-19 (COS-COVID). The COS-COVID includes one outcome for the mild type (time to 2019-nCoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity), four outcomes for the ordinary type (length of hospital stay, composite events, score of clinical symptoms, and time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), five outcomes for the severe type (composite events, length of hospital stay, arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), duration of mechanical ventilation, and time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), one outcome for critical type (all-cause mortality), and one outcome for rehabilitation period (pulmonary function). The COS-COVID is currently the most valuable and practical clinical outcome set for the evaluation of intervention effect, and is useful for evidence assessment and decision-making. With a deepening understanding of COVID-19 and application feedback, the COS-COVID should be continuously updated.","Jin, Xinyao; Pang, Bo; Zhang, Junhua; Liu, Qingquan; Yang, Zhongqi; Feng, Jihong; Liu, Xuezheng; Zhang, Lei; Wang, Baohe; Huang, Yuhong; Josephine Fauci, Alice; Ma, Yuling; Soo Lee, Myeong; Yuan, Wei039; an,; Xie, Yanming; Tang, Jianyuan; Gao, Rui; Du, Liang; Zhang, Shuo; Qi, Hanmei; Sun, Yu; Zheng, Wenke; Yang, Fengwen; Chua, Huizi; Wang, Keyi; Ou, Yi; Huang, Ming; Zhu, Yan; Yu, Jiajie; Tian, Jinhui; Zhao, Min; Hu, Jingqing; Yao, Chen; Li, Youping; Zhang, Boli",,216,16

We also observed that curcumin exhibited direct virucidal abilities in a dose-, temperature- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, time-of-addition assays showed that curcumin mainly acted in the early phase of TGEV replication. Notably, in an adsorption assay, curcumin at 40 µM resulted in a reduction in viral titres of 3.55 log TCID50 ml-1, indicating that curcumin possesses excellent inhibitory effects on the adsorption of TGEV. Collectively, we demonstrate for the first time that curcumin has virucidal activity and virtual inhibition against TGEV, suggesting that curcumin might be a candidate drug for effective control of TGEV infection.","Li, Yaoming; Wang, Jing; Liu, Yinchuan; Luo, Xiang; Lei, Weiqiang; Xie, Lilan",J Gen Virol,216,1

This approach, however, still requires improvement for its efficient application. In this paper, we present the use of wastewater-based epidemiology in monitoring COVID-19 infection dynamics in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa, focusing on four wastewater treatment plants for 14 weeks. The SARS-CoV-2 viral load in influent wastewater was determined using droplet digital PCR, and the number of people infected was estimated using published models as well as using a modified model to improve efficiency. On average, viral loads ranged between 0 and 2.73 × 105 copies/100 ml, 0-1.52 × 105 copies/100 ml, 3 × 104-7.32 × 105 copies/100 ml and 1.55 × 104-4.12 × 105 copies/100 ml in the four wastewater treatment plants studied. The peak in viral load corresponded to the reported COVID-19 infections within the districts where these catchments are located. In addition, we also observed that easing of lockdown restrictions by authorities corresponded with an increase in viral load in the untreated wastewater. Estimation of infection numbers based on the viral load showed that a higher number of people could potentially be infected, compared to the number of cases reported based on clinical testing. The findings reported in this paper contribute to the field of wastewater-based epidemiology for COVID-19 surveillance, whilst highlighting some of the challenges associated with this approach, especially in developing countries.","Pillay, Leanne; Amoah, Isaac Dennis; Deepnarain, Nashia; Pillay, Kriveshin; Awolusi, Oluyemi Olatunji; Kumari, Sheena; Bux, Faizal",Sci Total Environ,216,24

Systematic microbiological monitoring of deaths provides a fundamental basis to particularly assess underrecording of community-acquired mortality. It should be further elucidated whether a death cohort of previously unreported cases may be structurally different from the cohort of officially registered cases. Methods: A systematic reverse transcription (RT) qPCR testing for SARS-CoV­2 infections from nasopharyngeal swab samples was carried out. A representative sample of corpses from crematoria and the Institute of Legal Medicine of the Federal State of Hamburg were included. A comparative analysis of primarily reported and unreported fatalities in an 8­week period after occurrence of the first pandemic-related deaths in Hamburg was performed. Results: A total of 1231 deaths were included, all of which were previously unsuspicious for SARS-CoV­2 infection. Thereof 29 cases of previously unknown infections were recorded. In the first phase of the pandemic, incidental findings predominantly occurred among younger people from domestic environments with unclear or unnatural manner of death at the Institute of Legal Medicine. Over time, incidental findings investigated at the crematoria increased, mostly related to nursing home residents. The overall cohort showed no significant sociodemographic differences to a comparative collective of known SARS-CoV­2-associated deaths. Primarily unreported cases showed a significantly lower proportion of COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death. Conclusion: A systematic PCR-based monitoring of deaths allows a more targeted detection and classification of SARS-CoV­2 positive cases. A preventive contribution can be made by disclosing unreported pandemic-related cases of death.","Klein, Anke; Langenwalder, Felicia; Heinrich, Fabian; Meißner, Kira; Schröder, Ann Sophie; Püschel, Klaus; Ondruschka, Benjamin; Lütgehetmann, Marc; Heinemann, Axel",Rechtsmedizin (Berl),216,16

Muscle involvement has also been reported as evidenced by creatine kinase (CK) elevations and reports of myalgia. METHODS: Creatine kinase, markers of inflammation, pre-existing diseases and statin use were extracted from records of Austrian hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Disease severity was classified as severe in case of intensive care unit (ICU) admission or mortality. COVID-19 patients were additionally compared to an historical group of hospitalised influenza patients. RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-one patients with SARS-CoV-2 and 258 with influenza were included in the final analysis. CK was elevated in 27% of COVID-19 and in 28% of influenza patients. CK was higher in severe COVID-19 as were markers of inflammation. CK correlated significantly with inflammation markers, which had an independent impact on CK when adjusted for demographic variables and disease severity. Compared to influenza patients, COVID-19 patients were older, more frequently male, had more comorbidities, and more frequently had a severe disease course. Nevertheless, influenza patients had higher baseline CK than COVID-19, and 35.7% of intensive care unit (ICU)-admitted patients had CK levels >1000 U/l compared to only 4.7% of ICU-admitted COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: HyperCKemia occurs in a similar frequency in COVID-19 and influenza infection. CK levels were lower in COVID-19 than in influenza in mild and severe disease. CK levels strongly correlate with disease severity and markers of inflammation. To date, it remains unclear whether hyperCKemia is due to a virus-triggered inflammatory response or direct muscle toxicity.","Pitscheider, L; Karolyi, M; Burkert, F R; Helbok, R; Wanschitz, J V; Horlings, C; Pawelka, E; Omid, S; Traugott, M; Seitz, T; Zoufaly, A; Lindeck-Pozza, E; Wöll, E; Beer, R; Seiwald, S; Bellmann-Weiler, R; Hegen, H; Löscher, W N",Eur. j. neurol,216,30

Originally thought to affect only inexperienced, low-achieving students, recent investigations show how math anxiety is vastly diffused even among high-performing learners. This review of data-informed studies outlines math anxiety as a complex system that: (i) cripples well-being, self-confidence and information processing on both conscious and subconscious levels, (ii) can be transmitted by social interactions, like a pathogen, and worsened by distorted perceptions, (iii) affects roughly 20% of students in 63 out of 64 worldwide educational systems but correlates weakly with academic performance, and (iv) poses a concrete threat to students' well-being, computational literacy and career prospects in science. These patterns underline the crucial need to go beyond performance for estimating math anxiety. Recent advances with network psychometrics and cognitive network science provide ideal frameworks for detecting, interpreting and intervening upon such clinical condition. Merging education research, psychology and data science, the approaches reviewed here reconstruct psychological constructs as complex systems, represented either as multivariate correlation models (e.g. graph exploratory analysis) or as cognitive networks of semantic/emotional associations (e.g. free association networks or forma mentis networks). Not only can these interconnected networks detect otherwise hidden levels of math anxiety but - more crucially - they can unveil the specific layout of interacting factors, e.g. key sources and targets, behind math anxiety in a given cohort. As discussed here, these network approaches open concrete ways for unveiling students' perceptions, emotions and mental well-being, and can enable future powerful data-informed interventions untangling math anxiety.","Stella, Massimo",,216,26

METHODS: We examined the repercussions of the first wave of the pandemic on the trauma surgery clinic of a Level I Trauma Center and compared the data with data from 58 other trauma clinics. The results could aid in orientating the distribution of structural, financial, and human resources (HR) during the second wave. The period between March 16 and April 30, 2020 was compared with the data over the same period during 2019. Information was collected from the HR department, central revenue management, and internal documentation. RESULTS: The proportion of trauma surgical patients in the emergency room decreased by 22%. The number of polytrauma cases increased by 53%. Hospital days of trauma surgery patients in the intensive and intermediate care wards increased by 90%. The number of operations decreased by 15%, although the operating time outside of normal working hours increased by 44%. Clinics with more than 600 beds recorded a decrease in cases and emergencies by 8 and 9%, respectively, while the Trauma Center showed an increase of 19 and 12%. The results reflect the importance of level I trauma centers in the lockdown phase.

Sufficient evidence shows that temperature has an essential link with respiratory infectious diseases. The objectives of this study were to describe the exposure-response relationship between ambient temperature, including extreme temperatures, and mortality of COVID-19. METHODS: The Poisson distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was constructed to evaluate the non-linear delayed effects of ambient temperature on death, by using the daily new death of COVID-19 and ambient temperature data from January 10 to March 31, 2020, in Wuhan, China. RESULTS: During the period mentioned above, the average daily number of COVID-19 deaths was approximately 45.2. Poisson distributed lag non-linear model showed that there was a non-linear relationship (U-shape) between the effect of ambient temperature and mortality. With confounding factors controlled, the daily cumulative relative death risk decreased by 12.3% (95% CI [3.4, 20.4%]) for every 1.0 °C increase in temperature. Moreover, the delayed effects of the low temperature are acute and short-term, with the most considerable risk occurring in 5-7 days of exposure. The delayed effects of the high temperature appeared quickly, then decrease rapidly, and increased sharply 15 days of exposure, mainly manifested as acute and long-term effects. Sensitivity analysis results demonstrated that the results were robust. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between ambient temperature and COVID-19 mortality was non-linear. There was a negative correlation between the cumulative relative risk of death and temperature. Additionally, exposure to high and low temperatures had divergent impacts on mortality.","Zhu, Gaopei; Zhu, Yuhang; Wang, Zhongli; Meng, Weijing; Wang, Xiaoxuan; Feng, Jianing; Li, Juan; Xiao, Yufei; Shi, Fuyan; Wang, Suzhen",BMC Public Health,216,16

Deep-learning-based methods have the potential to automate this task but require a large amount of data with pixel-level annotations. Training a deep network with annotated lung cancer CT images, which are easier to obtain, can alleviate this problem to some extent. However, this approach may suffer from a reduction in performance when applied to unseen COVID-19 images during the testing phase due to the domain shift. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised method for COVID-19 infection segmentation that aims to learn the domain-invariant features from lung cancer and COVID-19 images to improve the generalization ability of the segmentation network for use with COVID-19 CT images. To overcome the intensity shift, our method first transforms annotated lung cancer data into the style of unlabeled COVID-19 data using an effective augmentation approach via a Fourier transform. Furthermore, to reduce the distribution shift, we design a teacher-student network to learn rotation-invariant features for segmentation. Experiments demonstrate that even without getting access to the annotations of COVID-19 CT during training, the proposed network can achieve a state-of-the-art segmentation performance on COVID-19 images.","Chen, Han; Jiang, Yifan; Ko, Hanseok; Loew, Murray",,216,16

MAIN BODY: Aiming to show clinical outcome of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers in hospital treatment of hypertensive patients with coronavirus disease 2019, systematically searched literatures through five databases were intensively appraised using The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation checklists for cohort studies. Based on the result evaluation from retrospective cohorts involving more than 15,000 patients across Asia and other regions of the world, ten encompassed studies divided into two subgroups in this meta-review showed that in-hospital hypertensive coronavirus disease 2019 patients receiving antihypertensive drugs were associated with overall risk reduction in subgroup 1 (hazard ratio, HR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.82-1.12) to no outcome association of all-cause mortalities in subgroup 2 (HR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.19-0.34). All appraised studies in synergism showed that mortality outcomes were not augmented with the employment of either ACE inhibitor or ARB in subjects.

The pandemic has not only social and economic effects, but even more impressive effects on the health system. If the virus spreads uncontrollably and rapidly, there is a risk of an unpredictable increase of patients with COVID-19 disease requiring hospital treatment. The capacities of a hospital can quickly reach the limit and consequently patients can no longer be adequately treated. Therefore, in the acute phase of the pandemic, it is necessary to release all hospital resources for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Strict hygiene regulations must also be observed in order to prevent the virus from spreading unexpectedly in the hospital in order to protect patients and hospital staff. Elective operations and outpatient clinics must be cancelled in the acute phase. Special hygiene measures must be observed for urgent and unpostponable operations. These relate to the admission of the patients, the accommodation in the ward and the operative care in the operating room. In the post-acute phase, a normal surgical program can be resumed step by step. In this phase, however, clear hygiene regulations must also be observed. Regular medical meetings taking into account the current pandemic situation and the occurrence of new infections must be carried out in the hospital and the occupancy of the ward and operating room adjusted accordingly.

SEARCH STRATEGY: We carried out a systematic search in multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, and WHO COVID-19 database using the following keywords: (Coronavirus) OR (novel coronavirus) OR (COVID-19) OR (COVID19) OR (COVID 19) OR (SARS-CoV2) OR (2019-nCoV)) and ((pregnancy) OR (pregnant) OR (vertical transmission) OR (neonate) OR (newborn) OR (placenta) OR (fetus) OR (Fetal)). The search took place in April 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Original articles published in English were eligible if they included pregnant patients infected with COVID-19 and their newborns. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSES: The outcomes of interest consisted of clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in pregnant patients with COVID-19 and also the effect of COVID-19 on neonatal and pregnancy outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: 37 articles involving 364 pregnant women with COVID-19 and 302 neonates were included. The vast majority of pregnant patients were in their third trimester of pregnancy, and only 45 cases were in the first or second trimester (12.4%). Most mothers described mild to moderate manifestations of COVID-19. Of 364 pregnant women, 25 were asymptomatic at the time of admission. The most common symptoms were fever (62.4%) and cough (45.3%). Two maternal deaths occurred. Some pregnant patients (12.1%) had a negative SARS-CoV-2 test but displayed clinical manifestations and abnormalities in computed tomography (CT) scan related to COVID-19. Twenty-two (6.0%) pregnant patients developed severe pneumonia. Two maternal deaths occurred from severe pneumonia and multiple organ dysfunction. Studies included a total of 302 neonates from mothers with COVID-19. Of the studies that provided data on the timing of birth, there were 65 (23.6%) preterm neonates. One baby was born dead from a mother who also died from COVID-19. Of the babies born alive from mothers with COVID-19, five newborns faced critical conditions, and two later died. A total of 219 neonates underwent nasopharyngeal specimen collection for SARS-CoV-2, of which 11 tested positive (5%). Seventeen studies examined samples of the placenta, breast milk, umbilical cord, and amniotic fluid, and all tested negative except one amniotic fluid sample. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic review of published studies confirm that the course of COVID-19 in pregnant women resembles that of other populations. However, there is not sufficient evidence to establish an idea that COVID-19 would not complicate pregnancy.","Mirbeyk, Mona; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Arch Gynecol Obstet,216,1

The pandemic caused drastic disruptions to medical institutions, including medical education. The Department of Laboratory Medicine at the University of Washington responded by rapidly implementing substantial changes to medical student clerkships. METHODS: In real time, we converted one ongoing case- and didactic-based course, LabM 685, to remote learning. RESULTS: Fifteen of 17 scheduled sessions proceeded as planned, including two sessions for student presentations. Two didactics were canceled as the functions of the teleconferencing platform were not sufficient to proceed. One grand rounds speaker canceled due to COVID-19 precautions. Elements of an immersive clinical laboratory clerkship, LabM 680, were repurposed to accommodate 40 medical students per class via remote learning, highlighting clinical laboratory activities that continue throughout the outbreak. A new remote clerkship, MedSci 585C, was developed incorporating distance learning and guided small-group sessions. This coincided with parallel efforts to make resident and fellow service work, conferences, and didactics available remotely to comply with social distancing. CONCLUSIONS: The changes in medical education described reflect the dynamic interplay of current events affecting the world of clinical pathology. Throughout this, technology-while with some limitations-has provided the platform for innovative learning.","Lieberman, Joshua A; Nester, Theresa; Emrich, Brooke; Staley, Elizabeth M; Bourassa, Lori A; Tsang, Hamilton C",Am. j. clin. pathol,216,9

Many quests to computationally identify treatments against the virus rely on in silico small molecule docking to experimentally determined structures of viral proteins. One limit to these approaches is that protein dynamics are often unaccounted for, leading to overlooking transient, druggable conformational states. Using Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics to enhance sampling of conformational space, we identified cryptic pockets within the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, including some within regions far from the active site. These simulations sampled comparable dynamics and pocket volumes to conventional brute force simulations carried out on two orders of magnitude greater timescales.","Sztain, Terra; Amaro, Rommie; McCammon, J Andrew",J. chem. inf. model,216,21

Laboratory and observational data suggested that hydroxychloroquine had biological activity against SARS-CoV-2, potentially permitting its use for prevention. OBJECTIVE: To test hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: Household-randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine postexposure prophylaxis. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04328961). SETTING: National U.S. multicenter study. PARTICIPANTS: Close contacts recently exposed (<96 hours) to persons with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. INTERVENTION: Hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/d for 3 days followed by 200 mg/d for 11 days) or ascorbic acid (500 mg/d followed by 250 mg/d) as a placebo-equivalent control. MEASUREMENTS: Participants self-collected mid-turbinate swabs daily (days 1 to 14) for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed incident SARS-CoV-2 infection among persons who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at enrollment. RESULTS: Between March and August 2020, 671 households were randomly assigned: 337 (407 participants) to the hydroxychloroquine group and 334 (422 participants) to the control group. Retention at day 14 was 91%, and 10 724 of 11 606 (92%) expected swabs were tested. Among the 689 (89%) participants who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at baseline, there was no difference between the hydroxychloroquine and control groups in SARS-CoV-2 acquisition by day 14 (53 versus 45 events; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.66]; P > 0.20). The frequency of participants experiencing adverse events was higher in the hydroxychloroquine group than the control group (66 [16.2%] versus 46 [10.9%], respectively; P = 0.026). LIMITATION: The delay between exposure, and then baseline testing and the first dose of hydroxychloroquine or ascorbic acid, was a median of 2 days. CONCLUSION: This rigorous randomized controlled trial among persons with recent exposure excluded a clinically meaningful effect of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Although the uptake of digital technology in health care has lagged behind other sectors, today, digital health is already becoming a cornerstone of developed health systems all over the world. Hence, the question is not whether we should adopt digital technology in health care, but how to do it most effectively. Digitally enabled remote care, or telemedicine has been available for many years but large-scale adoption has been slow. COVID-19 has caused a quantum leap in this area and particularly in the area of chronic disease and cancer care. The objective of this article is to briefly review the literature on the use of digitally enabled remote health care, in general and in cancer care specifically, with a focus on nursing practice, and to define the questions that need to be asked to guide effective implementation. DATA SOURCES: Review of the literature and the experience of the authors. CONCLUSION: There is increasing uptake of digitally enabled remote care. A growing body of evidence suggests that care delivered via telemedicine can be both safe and effective, in some cases with better outcomes than conventional face-to-face care. However, tele-oncology has not yet become standard practice. Digital health solutions need to be integrated into the patient pathway and in health care team practices for optimal supportive care in oncology in line with appropriate guidelines. Training education and formative evaluation are required to guide effective implementation. Formulating the right questions to ask is a critical starting point. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: There is very little debate today about the centrality of the role of the oncology nurse in coordinating care, guiding the patient, and providing ongoing support. Mobile technology provides an opportunity for monitoring and support through a minimally burdensome, maximally accessible approach. Moreover, smartphones and applications allow for repeated evaluation of adherence and symptoms in real time, ideally enhancing care for patients. However, even with the growing acceptance of ""nursing telepractice"", there are challenges and barriers to overcome to mainstream digital health into oncology nursing practice. Telemedicine services go much further than simply digitizing traditionally analogue health care processes and services, they fundamentally reorganize processes, procedures, and services. Thus, in addition to training and education, nursing tele-oncology demands a service transformation.","Kaye, Rachelle; Rosen-Zvi, Miriam; Ron, Reut",Semin Oncol Nurs,216,22

Having genetic background of autoimmune thyroid disorders is a risk factor for it because the immune reactivation during postpartum period is a trigger for PPT. Pandemic of COVID-19: caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is a global health problem, and occurrence of Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis after the viral infection have been reported but occurrence of PPT with COVID-19 has never been reported. A 29-year-old woman developed general fatigue four and a half months after parturition, and was diagnosed as having PPT: one month before, she had COVID-19. Hereafter, we define the date of delivery as Day 0 to make timeline clear. SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by PCR on Day 103, its disappearance from the upper airway confirmed on Day 124, and the thyroiditis diagnosed on Day 136. She had been euthyroid on Day 0 and 95, but thyrotoxic on Day 136. Serum thyroglobulin (Tg) concentration was normal in the presence of anti-Tg antibody, other thyroid-related autoantibodies were negative, and by ultrasonography, the thyroid gland was normal in size and no evidence of increased vascularity. Thyroid function returned to normal by Day 172 without any specific drug therapy.

The world's largest încarcerator has seen a small drop in prison numbers since 2008. However, the rate of decline is so slow that it would take half a century for incarceration numbers to reduce to historical levels. Further, the drop in prison numbers has occurred against the backdrop of piecemeal reforms, and there is no meaningful, systematic mechanism to reduce incarceration levels. Despite this, there is now, for the first time, a growing public acceptance that prison is a problematic, possibly flawed, sanction. Prison is expensive, inflicts serious unintended suffering on incarcerated people, and profoundly damages families. Alternatives to prison are finally being canvassed. In one respect this is not surprising. The way that we deal with serious offenders has not meaningfully changedfor more than 500 years-during all this time, we have simply locked offenders behind high walls. The way we deal with people who have caused serious harm has been more resistant to scientific and technological advances than any other aspect of society. The most radical suggestion regarding prison reform is to abolish prisons. Prison abolition has been a theme in some limited academic quarters for many decades. It had never received anything approaching mainstream credibility as a reform option, but this is now changing. Prominent politicians, social groups, university organizations, and mainstream media commentaries have recently advocated prison abolition. This proposal is no longer a fringe idea. It has gained considerable currency, particularly in light of the dual societychanging phenomena of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement. Yet, the persuasiveness of the proposal to abolish prison evaporates when any degree of intellectual rigor is cast over it. It is likely to go down as naive idealism due to the absence of any practical alternatives to prison. This Article shores up the notion of prison abolition to the maximum degree that is pragmatically feasible by carefully outlining an alternative to prison and hence addresses what is thought to be an insurmountable flaw in the abolitionist proposal. We advance a viable alternative to prison that involves the use and adaption of existing monitoring and censoring technology, which will enable us to monitor and observe the actions of offenders in real-time and, when necessary, to halt offenders ' potentially harmful acts before they occur. In proposing this new sanction, we provide lawmakers and the community a pathway to abolishing most prisons. The reforms suggested in this Article can result in the reduction of prison numbers by more than 90%, without any diminution in public safety.","Bagaric, Mirko Hunter Dan Svilar Jennifer",Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology,216,29

In human epilepsy surgical resections as well as in animal models, an involvement of the adaptive immune system was observed. We here analyzed the presence of T cells in various subgroups of MTLE. We aimed to answer the question of how much inflammation was present and whether the presence of T cells was associated with seizures or associated with hippocampal neurodegeneration. METHODS: We quantified the numbers of CD3+ T cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in the hippocampus of patients with gangliogliomas (GGs; intrahippocampal and extrahippocampal, with and without sclerosis), febrile seizures, and postinfectious encephalitic epilepsy and compared this with Rasmussen encephalitis, Alzheimer disease, and normal controls. RESULTS: We could show that T cell numbers were significantly elevated in MTLE compared to healthy controls. CD3+ as well as CD8+ T cell numbers, however, varied highly among MTLE subgroups. By comparing GG patients with and without hippocampal sclerosis (HS), we were able to show that T-cell numbers were increased in extrahippocampal GG patients with hippocampal neuronal loss and HS, whereas extrahippocampal GG cases without hippocampal neuronal loss (i.e., absence of HS) did not differ from healthy controls. Importantly, T cell numbers in MTLE correlated with the degree of neuronal loss, whereas no correlation with seizure frequency or disease duration was found. Finally, we found that in nearly all MTLE groups, T cell numbers remained elevated even years after the inciting event. SIGNIFICANCE: We here provide a detailed histopathological investigation of the involvement of T cells in various subgroups of MTLE, which suggests that T cell influx correlates to neuronal loss rather than seizure activity.","Tröscher, Anna R; Sakaraki, Eirini; Mair, Katharina M; Köck, Ulrike; Racz, Attila; Borger, Valeri; Cloppenborg, Thomas; Becker, Albert J; Bien, Christian G; Bauer, Jan",Epilepsia,216,12

Data from national government and the last published national audit of ICU resources indicate gross shortages. While the Critical Care Society of Southern Africa (CCSSA) guidelines provide a comprehensive guideline for triage in the face of overwhelmed ICU resources, such decisions present massive ethical and moral dilemmas for triage teams. It is therefore important for the health system to provide clinicians and critical care facilities with as much support and resources as possible in the face of impending pandemic demand. Following a discussion of the ethical considerations and potential challenges in applying the CCSSA guidelines, the authors propose a framework for regional triage committees adapted to the South African context. DISCUSSION: Beyond the national CCSSA guidelines, the clinician has many additional ethical and clinical considerations. No single ethical approach to decision-making is sufficient, instead one which considers multiple contextual factors is necessary. Scores such as the Clinical Frailty Score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment are of limited use in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, the clinician is fully justified in withdrawing ICU care based on medical futility decisions and to reallocate this resource to a patient with a better prognosis. However, these decisions bear heavy emotional and moral burden compounded by the volume of clinical work and a fear of litigation. CONCLUSION: We propose the formation of Provincial multi-disciplinary Critical Care Triage Committees to alleviate the emotional, moral and legal burden on individual ICU teams and co-ordinate inter-facility collaboration using an adapted framework. The committee would provide an impartial, broader and ethically-sound viewpoint which has time to consider broader contextual factors such as adjusting rationing criteria according to different levels of pandemic demand and the latest clinical evidence. Their functioning will be strengthened by direct feedback to national level and accountability to a national monitoring committee. The potential applications of these committees are far-reaching and have the potential to enable a more effective COVID-19 health systems response in South Africa.","Naidoo, Reshania; Naidoo, Kantharuben",BMC Med Ethics,216,16

Screening disparities continue to exist among ethnic minorities, particularly for African Americans. We herein review the barriers of colorectal cancer screening in this population. RECENT FINDINGS: At its foundation are patient barriers, which are further compounded by physician-related barriers and the idiosyncrasies of the healthcare system. Interventions to address the barriers include patient outreach, provider education, and healthcare legislation addressing financial barriers. Recent research has focused on factors predicting intentions to undergo colorectal cancer screening. Underlying all of the barriers is the systemic racism that affects and influences the healthcare system as much as all other institutions and contributes to inequities in the delivery of effective cancer prevention efforts. Perpetual disparities in CRC screening within the African American community are due to multifactorial barriers from the individual patient to provider and healthcare system and societal influences. An awareness of the behavioral and systemic factors that affect African Americans must underpin efforts to reach full equity in delivering CRC screening to this often medically underserved segment of our society.","White, Pascale M; Itzkowitz, Steven H",Curr Gastroenterol Rep,216,20

Thousands of people have lost their lives to this disease. Its negative effects on public health are ongoing. In this study, an intelligence computer-aided model that can automatically detect positive COVID-19 cases is proposed to support daily clinical applications. The proposed model is based on the convolution neural network (CNN) architecture and can automatically reveal discriminative features on chest X-ray images through its convolution with rich filter families, abstraction, and weight-sharing characteristics. Contrary to the generally used transfer learning approach, the proposed deep CNN model was trained from scratch. Instead of the pre-trained CNNs, a novel serial network consisting of five convolution layers was designed. This CNN model was utilized as a deep feature extractor. The extracted deep discriminative features were used to feed the machine learning algorithms, which were k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree. The hyperparameters of the machine learning models were optimized using the Bayesian optimization algorithm. The experiments were conducted on a public COVID-19 radiology database. The database was divided into two parts as training and test sets with 70% and 30% rates, respectively. As a result, the most efficient results were ensured by the SVM classifier with an accuracy of 98.97%, a sensitivity of 89.39%, a specificity of 99.75%, and an F-score of 96.72%. Consequently, a cheap, fast, and reliable intelligence tool has been provided for COVID-19 infection detection. The developed model can be used to assist field specialists, physicians, and radiologists in the decision-making process.

We measured anti-Spike IgG, IgA and IgM levels with the S-Flow assay and map IgG-targeted epitopes by Luminex. We also evaluated neutralization, complement deposition and Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) using replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 or reporter cell systems. We show that COVID-19 sera mediate complement deposition and kill infected cells by ADCC. Sera from asymptomatic individuals neutralize the virus, activate ADCC and trigger complement deposition.

Appearance of coronavirus disease caused by coronavirus COVID-19 is new addition to the list of the deadly diseases linked with unseen enemies. Coronavirus was first discovered ninety years back as an agent causing acute respiratory infection in chickens. A strain of coronavirus that has ability to infect human being was discovered in the year 1960. Various types of coronavirus have been shown to have a link with respiratory infections. An outbreak due to human coronavirus was identified in December 2019 from Wuhan, Hubei province of China. This pandemic, including India is now reported from 212 countries of the world with 4,026,838 cases confirming the presence of the coronavirus (as reported on May 09, 2020, 05:15 GMT). A closer look in to the reported cases present a deeper picture of the pandemic. Initial reports from China suggested it having 82,887 cases. France, Italy and Spain are with 176,079, 217,185 and 260,117 cases respectively. Largest number of cases is reported from United States of America, which is now having 30.54% of all the cases reported. This data speaks volumes about the nature of the coronavirus particularly its cellular pathogenesis, tissue tropism, portal of entry, replication at the entry site, dissemination, incubation, multiplication and shedding of this virus. As of now, Europe is the severely affected part of the world due to coronavirus. Other countries of the world are not immune to this pandemic. Breakneck research dedicated for the development of potent drug and effective vaccines is underway with varying degree of potency claims. It is not possible to present the complete aspects of coronavirus and its associated developments;the aim of this short communication is to present a bird eye view of the currents status of this pandemic from India.","Shilpy, Shakya Yadav B.

These represent prototypical tumor suppressor syndromes where loss of a tumor suppressor gene-protein impairs the cell's ability to regulate cell proliferation. While clinical manifestations vary widely for each of these syndromes, tumors arising in the peripheral nerve sheath are a unifying feature. Clinical clues should prompt the clinician to recognize the underlying genetic syndrome and screen for associated tumors including, among others, plexiform neurofibromas and gliomas in NF1 and vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, and spinal ependymomas in NF2. Improvements in mechanistic understanding of how the genetic mutations that underlie these syndromes contribute to tumor formation have led to new advances in targeted therapies. MEK inhibitors have shown promise for treating progressive plexiform neurofibromas in NF1. Bevacizumab has been shown to improve hearing and treat vestibular schwannomas in NF2. This article reviews the currently available data on management of tumors associated with these three syndromes.","Strowd, Roy E",Curr Treat Options Oncol,216,29

However, the contribution of platelet reactivity (PR) to the aetiology of the increased thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19 remains unclear. Our aim was to evaluate PR in stable patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized with respiratory symptoms (mainly dyspnoea and dry cough), in comparison with a control group comprised of non-hospitalized healthy controls. METHODS: Observational, case control study that included patients with confirmed COVID-19 (COVID-19 group, n = 60) and healthy individuals matched by age and sex (control group, n = 60). Multiplate electrode aggregometry (MEA) tests were used to assess PR with adenosine diphosphate (MEA-ADP, low PR defined as < 53 AUC), arachidonic acid (MEA-ASPI, low PR < 86 AUC) and thrombin receptor-activating peptide 6 (MEA-TRAP, low PR < 97 AUC) in both groups. RESULTS: The rates of low PR with MEA-ADP were 27.5% in the COVID-19 group and 21.7% in the control group (OR = 1.60, p = 0.20); with MEA-ASPI, the rates were, respectively, 37.5% and 22.5% (OR = 3.67, p < 0.001); and with MEA-TRAP, the incidences were 48.5% and 18.8%, respectively (OR = 9.58, p < 0.001). Levels of D-dimer, fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) were higher in the COVID-19 group in comparison with the control group (all p < 0.05). Thromboelastometry was utilized in a subgroup of patients and showed a hypercoagulable state in the COVID-19 group. CONCLUSION: Patients hospitalized with non-severe COVID-19 had lower PR compared to healthy controls, despite having higher levels of D-dimer, fibrinogen, and PAI-1, and hypercoagulability by thromboelastometry.

SUMMARY: An 86-year-old man on dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily for stroke prevention with atrial fibrillation was admitted to the hospital for bowel obstruction and severe acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease. The patient had an abnormal coagulation profile and no history of bleeding. Initial laboratory values revealed a hemoglobin concentration of 10.7 g/dL, a platelet count of 115 × 103 platelets/µL, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 150.4 seconds, an international normalized ratio of 10.28, a thrombin time greater than 100 seconds and a serum creatinine of 5.54 mg/dL (490 µmol/L). An initial dose of idarucizumab was administered 1 hour prior to surgery to prevent bleeding. Significant bleeding and hemodynamic instability occurred following surgery. Three additional doses of idarucizumab, 2 sessions of intermittent hemodialysis, continuous venovenous hemofiltration and blood products were required to achieve normalization of coagulation parameters and hemodynamic stability due to rebound coagulopathy after each dose of idarucizumab. CONCLUSION: Acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease and third-space redistribution could have led to important dabigatran accumulation and favored rebound coagulopathy. Multiple therapeutic approaches may be required in the management of complex dabigatran intoxication.","Flynn, Francis; Richard, Guillaume; Dobrescu, Marc A; Bouchard, Josée; Williamson, David; Brindamour, Dave; Charbonney, Emmanuel; Dupuis, Sébastien",J Pharm Pract,216,1

This study aims to evaluate the impact of a smoking cessation program carried out in food pantries on the smoking status and the food security status of food pantry users. METHODS / DESIGN: Before starting the cluster randomised controlled trial, stakeholders will be engaged to adapt a behavioural group counselling program for smoking cessation to the needs of the food pantry users in a pre study. Food pantry users and workers as well as other experts, such as smoking cessation trainers, social workers, and psychologists, will be involved, using the world café technique and telephone interviews and a qualitative thematic analysis for data analysis to design the concept of the intervention program will be applied. In the second phase, the impact of the intervention on the smoking status and on food insecurity will be investigated by a cluster randomised controlled trial. A total of 416 food pantry users across 32 clusters (food pantries) in Berlin, Germany, should be recruited and randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the waiting list control group. The intervention will consist of a behavioural group counselling program for smoking cessation, specially tailored for food pantry users, as well as optional nicotine replacement therapy and the implementation of environmental smoking reduction measures in the food pantries. The primary outcomes 6 months after the treatment will be self-reported continuous smoking abstinence, validated by exhaled carbon monoxide (< 10 ppm of carbon monoxide), and increased food security level (the percentage of participants with an improved food security level). DISCUSSION: This study will be the first long-term investigation into the effect of a smoking cessation program on smoking status and food insecurity. The results of this study will inform the implementation of smoking cessation programs in food pantries throughout Germany. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Prospectively registered DRKS00020037 .

We combined the footage with the Pioneers of European Nephrology series obtained by ERA-EDTA and today there is a collection of 177 videos on the Nephrology Video Legacy playlist and 82 videos on the Nephrology Pioneers playlist both of which can be found on the YouTube Channel of Kim Solez Some videos recorded in 2019 were reduced to audio-only with the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Europe in 2020 http://www youtube com/user/kimsolez Results: Top videos included: Homer Smith Comical Film About Function of the Kidney from 1950s, Wilhelm Kolff Video Legacy Interview 1995, Donald W Seldin Video Legacy Interview 1997, Resurrecting Video Legacy Project Apr 19 2018, Robert H Heptinstall Video Legacy Interview October 1995 Conclusions: Many of the people interviewed such as Homer Smith, Robert Heptinstall, J Stewart Cameron, John Dirks, and Gabriel Richet had an important influence on the senior author’s direction of the Banff Transplant Pathology Meetings and the spirit and philosophy of those meetings George Orwell wrote “The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history ” It is comforting that in the end this did not happen to nephrology No conflict of interest","Hu, R.; Moghe, I.; Dhungana, P.; Kim, S.; Cameron, J.

The impacts of the disease may be beyond the respiratory system, also affecting mental health. Several factors may be involved in the association between COVID-19 and psychiatric outcomes, such as fear inherent in the pandemic, adverse effects of treatments, as well as financial stress, and social isolation. Herein we discuss the growing evidence suggesting that the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and host may also trigger changes in brain and behavior. Based on the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it is conceivable that changes in endocrine and immune response in the periphery or in the central nervous system may be involved in the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and impaired mental health. This is likely to be further enhanced, since millions of people worldwide are isolated in quarantine to minimize the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and social isolation can also lead to neuroendocrine-immune changes. Accordingly, we highlight here the hypothesis that neuroendocrine-immune interactions may be involved in negative impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection and social isolation on psychiatric issues.","Raony, Ícaro; de Figueiredo, Camila Saggioro; Pandolfo, Pablo; Giestal-de-Araujo, Elizabeth; Oliveira-Silva Bomfim, Priscilla; Savino, Wilson",Front Immunol,216,5

However, for new soft robots with degrees of freedom dissimilar to those of human operators, it is unknown how the control of a task should be divided between the human and robot. This work presents a set of interaction paradigms between a human and a soft growing robot manipulator, and demonstrates them in both real and simulated scenarios. The robot can grow and retract by eversion and inversion of its tubular body, a property we exploit to implement interaction paradigms. We implemented and tested six different paradigms of human-robot interaction, beginning with full teleoperation and gradually adding automation to various aspects of the task execution. All paradigms were demonstrated by two expert and two naive operators. Results show that humans and the soft robot manipulator can split control along degrees of freedom while acting simultaneously. In the simple pick-and-place task studied in this work, performance improves as the control is gradually given to the robot, because the robot can correct certain human errors. However, human engagement and enjoyment may be maximized when the task is at least partially shared. Finally, when the human operator is assisted by haptic feedback based on soft robot position errors, we observed that the improvement in performance is highly dependent on the expertise of the human operator.","Stroppa, Fabio; Selvaggio, Mario; Agharese, Nathaniel; MingLuo,; Blumenschein, Laura H.; Hawkes, Elliot W.; Okamura, Allison M.",,216,22

In the present study, we examined the association between distribution frequency of ACE genotypes and COVID-19 mortality. METHODS: We undertook an ecological study to examine the association between ACE genotypes and COVID-19 mortality across 25 countries to represent different geographical regions of the world. The population frequencies of ACE genotypes were drawn from previously published reports and data on COVID-19-related mortality were extracted from 'Worldometer'. Multivariable analyses were also undertaken adjusting for age (median age), sex (percentage of females) and the number of COVID-19 tests undertaken. Associations between genotypes deletion/deletion (DD) and insertion/insertion (II) prevalence and COVID-19-related mortality (per million people per day since the first diagnosed case) were evaluated. RESULTS: The frequency of II genotype is highest in east Asian countries and lower among the European and African countries. An inverse geographical distribution frequency was noted for DD genotype. Increasing II genotype frequency was significantly associated with decreased COVID-19 mortality rates (adjusted incident rate ratio [IRR] 0.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.002-0.7, pâ¯=â¯0.03). However, no association was found between DD genotype frequency and COVID-19 mortality rates (adjusted IRR 4.3, 95% CI: 0.5-41.2, pâ¯=â¯0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Distribution frequency of ACE insertion/insertion (II) genotype may have a significant influence on COVID-19 mortality. This information has potential utility for resource planning at a systemic level, as well as for clinical management.","Aung, Ar K; Aitken, Tess; Teh, Bing M; Yu, Christiaan; Ofori-Asenso, Richard; Chin, Ken L; Liew, Danny",J. infect,216,29

This contrasted with its Scandinavian neighbours which implemented stringent restrictions. The influence these different approaches had on mobility, and thus on COVID-19 mortality was investigated. METHODS: Datasets indicating restriction severity and community mobility were examined; Google's 'Community Movement Reports' (CMR) show activity at key location categories; the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker collates legislative restrictions into a 'Stringency Index' (SI). RESULTS: CMR mobility categories were negatively correlated with COVID-19 mortality. The strongest correlations were obtained by negatively time lagging mortality data, suggesting restrictions had a delayed influence. During the 'first wave' a model using SI (AIC 632.87) proved favorable to one using contemporaneous CMR data and SI (AIC 1193.84), or lagged CMR data and SI (AIC 642.35). Validation using 'second wave' data confirmed this; the model using SI solely again being optimal (RMSE: 0.2486 vs. 0.522 and 104.62). Cross-country differences were apparent in all models; Swedish data, independent of SI and CMR, proved significant throughout. There was a significant association for Sweden and the death number across models. CONCLUSION: SI may provide a broader, more accurate, representation of changes in movement in response to COVID-19 restrictions.","Sulyok, Mihály; Walker, Mark David",Travel Med Infect Dis,216,16

The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and host cell proteins is the first and decisive step in establishing a COVID-19 infection. This fact inspired us to create ViruClear, a molecularly designed biomimetic proteolipid bilayer decoy receptor nanosponge (100 nm nanospheres) containing an optimal combination of receptors and factors used by SARS-CoV-2 to bind host cells. Antiviral medicine (and most vaccines) often target a single viral target and may be rendered ineffective as the virus accumulates mutations and escapes treatments. By contrast, ViruClear nanosponges display as ?decoys? the same set of receptors and factors that the SARS-CoV-2 depend on for cellular entry and infection. As such, the ViruClear platform is agnostic to viral mutations and potentially viral variant species, as long as the entry receptors overlap with those of SARS-CoV-2. Our preliminary data validate that the ViruClear decoy can multivalently trap viral particles and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infections in animal and human cells. ViruClear is a novel ?game changing? decoy receptor nanosponge optimized for multivalent capture of SARS-CoV-2 in the body (IV injection) or as a preventive measure in nebulized formats (e.g., molecular PPE).

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have a significant relationship with COVID-19, both as a risk factor and prognostic indicator, and as a complication of the disease itself. In addition to predisposing to CVD complications, the ongoing pandemic has severely affected the delivery of timely and appropriate care for cardiovascular conditions resulting in increased mortality. The etiology behind the cardiac injury associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is likely varied, including coronary artery disease, microvascular thrombosis, myocarditis, and stress cardiomyopathy. Further large-scale investigations are needed to better determine the underlying mechanism of myocardial infarction and other cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients and to determine the incidence of each type of cardiac injury in this patient population. Telemedicine and remote monitoring technologies can play an important role in optimizing outcomes in patients with established CVD. In this article, we summarize the various impacts that COVID-19 has on the cardiovascular system, including myocardial infarction, myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, thrombosis, and stroke.","Greenberg, Arielle; Pemmasani, Gayatri; Yandrapalli, Srikanth; Frishman, William H",Cardiol Rev,216,20

However, bleeding complications have also been observed in some patients. Understanding the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis will help inform optimal approaches to thrombosis prophylaxis and potential utility of fibrinolytic-targeted therapies. 118 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 30 healthy controls were included in the study. We measured plasma antigen levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and performed spontaneous clot-lysis assays. We found markedly elevated tPA and PAI-1 levels in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Both factors demonstrated strong correlations with neutrophil counts and markers of neutrophil activation. High levels of tPA and PAI-1 were associated with worse respiratory status. High levels of tPA, in particular, were strongly correlated with mortality and a significant enhancement in spontaneous ex vivo clot-lysis. While both tPA and PAI-1 are elevated among COVID-19 patients, extremely high levels of tPA enhance spontaneous fibrinolysis and are significantly associated with mortality in some patients. These data indicate that fibrinolytic homeostasis in COVID-19 is complex with a subset of patients expressing a balance of factors that may favor fibrinolysis. Further study of tPA as a biomarker is warranted.","Zuo, Yu; Warnock, Mark; Harbaugh, Alyssa; Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi; Gockman, Kelsey; Zuo, Melanie; Madison, Jacqueline A; Knight, Jason S; Kanthi, Yogendra; Lawrence, Daniel A",Sci Rep,216,21

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of an anonymous survey sent via text message link to personal cell phones and emails. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home and assisted living facility staff in Indiana. MEASURES: Staff characteristics including age, gender, race, ethnicity, role in the facility, experience in long-term care, and geographic location of facility were self-reported along with prior infection and willingness to receive an approved vaccine as soon as it is available. Responses were weighted to represent staff statewide. Weighted frequencies and logit regression estimated characteristics associated with vaccine willingness. RESULTS: There were 8,243 responses to the survey. For nursing home staff (survey delivered via 23,232 working phone numbers), there was a 33% response rate). There were 2,372 (29%) in nurse aide or similar roles and 1,602 nurses providing direct clinical care (19%). Overall, 45% of respondents indicated they would receive an approved COVID-19 vaccine as soon as available. Of those unwilling to take the vaccine when first available, 44% would consider in the future. Concerns about side effects was the primary reason for vaccine hesitancy (70%). Characteristics associated with increased willingness were age over 60, male, and white race (P < .0001). No statistically significant differences were observed among staff self-reporting prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine immediately or in the future may be as high as 69%, but varies among subgroups of nursing home staff which has implications for distribution. Educating staff on the vaccine may be critical for increasing uptake. Widespread vaccination holds the promise of protection against serious illness and death and a return of visitors and activities that support improved quality of life. This promise will not be realized without strong uptake of the vaccines.","Unroe, Kathleen T; Evans, Russell; Weaver, Lindsay; Rusyniak, Dan; Blackburn, Justin",J. am. geriatr. soc,216,2

States dashboards, however, reflect idiosyncratic design practices based on their content, function, and visual design and platform. There has been little guidance for what state dashboards should look like or contain, leading to significant variation. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of our study was to catalog how information, system function, and user interface were deployed across the COVID-19 state dashboards. Our secondary objective was to group and characterize the dashboards based on the information we collected using clustering analysis. METHODS: For preliminary data collection, we developed a framework to first analyze two dashboards as a group and reach agreement on coding. We subsequently doubled coded the remaining 48 dashboards using the framework and reviewed the coding to reach total consensus. RESULTS: All state dashboards included maps and graphs, most frequently line charts, bar charts, and histograms. The most represented metrics were total deaths, total cases, new cases, laboratory tests, and hospitalization. Decisions on how metrics were aggregated and stratified greatly varied across dashboards. Overall, the dashboards were very interactive with 96% having at least some functionality including tooltips, zooming, or exporting capabilities. For visual design and platform, we noted that the software was dominated by a few major organizations. Our cluster analysis yielded a six-cluster solution, and each cluster provided additional insights about how groups of states engaged in specific practices in dashboard design. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that states engaged in dashboard practices that generally aligned with many of the goals set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Essential Public Health Services. We highlight areas where states fall short of these expectations and provide specific design recommendations to address these gaps.","Fareed, Naleef; Swoboda, Christine M; Chen, Sarah; Potter, Evelyn; Wu, Danny T Y; Sieck, Cynthia J",Appl Clin Inform,216,21

Extension has not only been an audience for Agricultural Safety and Health Center work, but also an essential partner in promoting evidence-based farm health and safety in communities. This commentary stems from a collaborative effort among Center leaders across the nation who developed a set of surveys to explore the ways COVID-19 has affected Extension professionals. Preliminary data gathered from across the nation suggest that while many Extension professionals feel prepared to address challenges from the pandemic and are well supported by their State and Center's resources, over half also reported moderate to great difficulty in balancing personal and professional needs and, to a lesser extent, balancing remote work and family needs. Because Extension professionals act as connectors between Agricultural Safety and Health Centers and farmers and their families, they serve in a role similar to first-responders.

The purpose of this study was to explore the early clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 from a single centre. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on admission. Demographic and clinical factors and laboratory data were reviewed and collected to evaluate for significant associations. RESULTS: The study included 541 patients with COVID-19. A total of 144 (26.6%) patients had a history of CVD. The mortality of patients with CVD reached 22.2%, which was higher than that of the overall population of this study (9.8%). Patients with CVD were also more likely to develop liver function abnormality, elevated blood creatinine and lactic dehydrogenase (p<0.05). Symptoms of sputum production were more common in patients with CVD (p=0.026). Lymphocytes, haemoglobin and albumin below the normal range were pervasive in the CVD group (p<0.05). The proportion of critically ill patients in the CVD group (27.8%) was significantly higher than that in the non-CVD group (8.8%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that CVD (OR: 2.735 (95% CI 1.495 to 5.003), p=0.001) was associated with critical COVID-19 condition, while patients with coronary heart disease were less likely to reach recovery standards (OR: 0.331 (95% CI 0.125 to 0.880), p=0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Considering the high prevalence of CVD, a thorough CVD assessment at diagnosis and early intervention are recommended in COVID-19 patients with CVD. Patients with CVD are more vulnerable to deterioration.","Zhang, Jixiang; Lu, Shimin; Wang, Xiaoli; Jia, Xuemei; Li, Jiao; Lei, Hongbo; Liu, Zhengru; Liao, Fei; Ji, Mengyao; Lv, Xiaoguang; Kang, Jian; Tian, Shan; Ma, Jingjing; Wu, Dandan; Gong, Yang; Xu, Yu; Dong, Weiguo",Heart,216,6

This was critical for stabilizing Teff cell functions and subverting immune-suppressive signals. T cell-specific deletion of Pcbp1 favored Treg cell differentiation, enlisted multiple inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules including PD-1, TIGIT, and VISTA on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and blunted antitumor immunity.

Given the global spatial heterogeneity in case-fatality rates, we applied the Blinder-Oaxaca regression decomposition technique to identify how putative sociodemographic, structural, and environmental sources influence variation in case-fatality rates. We show that compositional and associational differences in country-level risk factors explain a substantial proportion of the coronavirus disease 2019-related case-fatality rate gap across nations. Asian countries fair better vis-à-vis case-fatality rate differences mainly due to variation in returns to sociodemographic, structural, and environmental sources among their citizens, relative to those who share similar attributes but live in Europe or North America. The variation in case-fatality rate is driven by Asian populations being better able to buffer the harmful effects of the very risk factors purported to exacerbate the risk of coronavirus disease 2019-related death. The dire circumstances in which we find ourselves demand better understanding of how preexisting conditions across countries contribute to observed disparities in case-fatality rates.","Kranjac, Ashley Wendell; Kranjac, Dinko",Pathog Glob Health,216,3

Mild-term complications of Covid-19 are currently unknown, especially in this population. Herein, we report two cases of BKV replication after non-severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The first case was a 59-year-old man, transplanted 3 months ago, with recent history of slight BKV viremia (3.3 log10 DNA copies/ml). Despite strong reduction of maintenance immunosuppression (interruption of mycophenolic acid and important decrease of calcineurin inhibitors), BKV replication largely increased after Covid-19 and viremia persisted at 4.5 log copy/ml few months later. The second case was a 53-year-old woman, transplanted 15 years ago. She had a recent history of BKV cystitis, which resolved with a decrease of MPA dosage. Few weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection, she presented recurrence of lower urinary tract symptoms. Our reports highlight that SARS-CoV-2 infection, even without severity, could disrupt immune system and particularly lymphocytes, thus leading to viral replication. Monitoring of viral replications after Covid-19 in kidney transplant recipients could permit to confirm these preliminary observations.","Masset, Christophe; Ville, Simon; Halary, Franck; Gaborit, Benjamin; Bressolette-Bodin, Celine; Deltombe, Clément; Dujardin, Amaury; Jacquemont, Lola; Lebot, Sabine; Kervella, Delphine; Figueres, Lucille; Cantarovich, Diego; Giral, Magali; Hourmant, Maryvonne; Blancho, Gilles; Garandeau, Claire; Meurette, Aurélie; Dantal, Jacques",Transpl Infect Dis,216,17

It is responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The ability to gain quick control of the pandemic has been hampered by a lack of detailed knowledge about SARS-CoV-2-host interactions, mainly in relation to viral biology and host immune response. The rapid clinical course seen in COVID-19 indicates that infection control in asymptomatic patients or patients with mild disease is probably due to the innate immune response, as, considering that SARS-CoV-2 is new to humans, an effective adaptive response would not be expected to occur until approximately 2-3 weeks after contact with the virus. Antiviral innate immunity has humoral components (complement and coagulation-fibrinolysis systems, soluble proteins that recognize glycans on cell surface, interferons, chemokines, and naturally occurring antibodies) and cellular components (natural killer cells and other innate lymphocytes). Failure of this system would pave the way for uncontrolled viral replication in the airways and the mounting of an adaptive immune response, potentially amplified by an inflammatory cascade. Severe COVID-19 appears to be due not only to viral infection but also to a dysregulated immune and inflammatory response. In this paper, the authors review the most recent publications on the immunobiology of SARS-CoV-2, virus interactions with target cells, and host immune responses, and highlight possible associations between deficient innate and acquired immune responses and disease progression and mortality. Immunotherapeutic strategies targeting both the virus and dysfunctional immune responses are also addressed.","Boechat, J L; Chora, I; Morais, A; Delgado, L","Pulmonology (Barc., Print)",216,12

This study aimed to quantify changes in vitamin D level among infants and toddlers in Hong Kong after the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: We recruited 303 infants and toddlers aged 2-24 months by stratified random sampling from 1 June 2019 to November 30, 2020. Regression models were used to estimate the effect of time on infants' serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level overall and by age groups before and after the outbreak. Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis was performed to examine the sustained effect of COVID-19 on their serum 25(OH)D level. Results: The ITS results showed no immediate reduction in serum 25(OH)D level among infants, but a decreasing trend was observed in the subsequent months post-outbreak at a monthly decline rate of -6.32 nmol/L. When analyzed by age group, the magnitude of post-outbreak reduction in 25(OH)D was stronger among younger infants (aged 2-6 months). Conclusion: Guidelines and recommendations should be given to pregnant women and mothers to ensure sufficient vitamin D level in their infants during the COVID-19 period.","Wong, Rosa S; Tung, Keith T S; So, Hung-Kwan; Wong, Wilfred H S; Wong, Siew Yan; Tsang, Hing Wai; Tung, Joanna Y L; Chua, Gilbert T; Ho, Marco H K; Wong, Ian C K; Ip, Patrick",Nutrients,216,16

We report data on 72 patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing both before and after kidney transplantation and were followed for a median of 186 days (range 83, 277). Of the 25 patients with a positive antibody test at the time of transplant, 17 (68%) remained positive after transplantation. Patients were significantly more likely to have a persistently positive test if they reported a symptomatic COVID-19 infection prior to transplant (p=0.01). SARS-CoV-2 IgG index values were measured in a subset of kidney transplant recipients and compared to wait -listed dialysis patients. These assays demonstrated a more significant decline in IgG (58% versus 14% p = 0.008) in transplant recipients when compared to dialysis patients tested during the same time period. Additional analysis of the quality of the immune response measuring the binding of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD binding), the antibody neutralizing capability, and the antibody avidity demonstrated a more pronounced effect when comparing pre-transplant values to post-induction therapy/post transplant values.

The study applies an analysis methodology based on previous research focusing on specialized web studies, defining an analysis model on six variables and 65 thematic indicators. The research concludes that hospitals occupying first positions in the medical services directory are not necessarily those that have the best websites. Similarly, it is worth noting that a quarter of the studied sample do not devote a specific space to reporting coronavirus information.

We use a dataset from a large-scale speaking test for which test-takers were required to wear face masks during the test administration, and we compare it to a matched control sample of test-takers who took the same test before the mask requirements were put in place. We find that the two samples differ across a range of acoustic measures and also show a small but significant difference in speech patterns.

Although most clinical efforts within hospitals were diverted towards the care of virally infected patients, therapies for patients with cancer, including radiotherapy (RT), have continued. During both the first and second pandemic waves, several national and regional organizations provided Italian and Lombardian RT departments with detailed guidelines aimed at ensuring safe treatments during the pandemic. The spread of infection among patients and personnel was limited by adopting strict measures, including triage procedures, interpersonal distance, and adequate implementation of personal protective equipment (PPE). Screening procedures addressed to both the healthcare workforce and patients, such as periodic nasopharyngeal swabs, have allowed the early identification of asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic COVID-19 cases, thus reducing the spread of the infection. Prevention of infection was deemed of paramount importance to protect both patients and personnel and to ensure the availability of a minimum number of staff members to maintain clinical activity. The choice of treating COVID-19-positive patients has represented a matter of debate, and the risk of oncologic progression has been weighted against the risk of infection of personnel and other patients. Such risk was minimized by creating dedicated paths, reserving time slots, applying intensified cleaning procedures, and supplying personnel and staff with appropriate PPE.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between selenium status in the body and incidence and mortality of CVD by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and randomized controlled trials. Methods: A systematic search for articles in MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) and Cochrane library (Wiley) was conducted. Thirteen of the 1811 articles obtained from the databases met our inclusion criteria and were considered in the final analysis. The effect sizes were presented as weighted relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects model. To detect dose-response relationships, we used meta-regression. Results: Overall, there was a reduced risk of CVD incidence (RR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.40-1.09) and mortality (RR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57-0.84) in physiologically high selenium status compared to low selenium status in the body.

In addition, a statistically significantly nonlinear dose-response relationship was found between CVD mortality and increased blood selenium concentration with the lowest risk at the 30-35 µg increment in blood selenium. Conclusions: Physiologically high selenium levels in the body are associated with decreased risk for CVD incidence and mortality, however, people should be cautious about the potential harmful effects from excessive intake of selenium.","Kuria, Angelica; Tian, Hongdou; Li, Mei; Wang, Yinhe; Aaseth, Jan Olav; Zang, Jiajie; Cao, Yang",Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr,216,20

Our main aim was to obtain evidence to support the use of modified national early warning score (m-NEWS) as an interdisciplinary, common, and universal scoring scale to quickly recognize patients with a risk of clinical deterioration before admission and during hospitalization. As a secondary goal, we tried to find a score threshold that can trigger patients' immediate medical review as a part of an optimal triaging protocol for an emergency setting where healthcare resources are overloaded. We performed a retrospective observational study. We included in our study all patients treated for COVID-19 infection in surgical departments between 01 March 2020 and 16 April 2020. Patients with negative test results for SARS-COV-2 were excluded. m-NEWS was obtained twice a day. Patients' m-NEWS were analyzed in order to verify the correlation between m-NEWS (at admission and m-NEWS variation 24 h after admission) and outcome (positive outcome-survival, negative outcome-death, or intensive care unit (ICU) transfer). We included a population-based sample of 225 SARS-COV-2-infected patients. Overall, the average age at hospitalization was 71 (ranging from 40 to 95). 144 (64%) patients were males and 81 (36%) females. m-NEWS values lower or equal to 7 were associated with the majority of the ""recovered"" population (100/132 75.75%) and at the same time with the minority of the ""non-recovered"" population (25/93 26.88%). For our sample, age is statistically correlated to the outcome but a triage protocol based solely on this variable is less effective than m-NEWS, which showed to be a reliable and easy-to-use score for first patient evaluation. Our observations pave the way towards further studies aiming at optimizing territorial and community healthcare management protocols.","Tagliabue, Fabio; Schena, Daniele; Galassi, Luca; Magni, Matteo; Guerrazzi, Guglielmo; Acerbis, Andrea; Rinallo, Christina; Longhi, Daniel; Ronzani, Alberto; Mariani, Pierpaolo",SN Compr Clin Med,216,21

Comorbid diseases are determinants of the severity of COVID-19 infection and mortality. The aim of this study was to explore the potential association between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the severity of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: The study included 609 consecutive adult patients (male: 54.52%, mean age: 59.23 ± 15.55 years) hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a tertiary level hospital. Data were collected from the electronic health records of the hospital. The patients were separated into two groups: Group I included COVID-19-positive patients with CKD stage 1-2, and Group II included COVID-19-positive with CKD stage 3-5. The relationships were examined between CKD stage, laboratory parameters and mortality. RESULTS: Significant differences were determined between the groups in respect of the inflammation parameters and the parameters used in prognosis. In Group II, statistically significantly higher rates were determined of comorbid diseases [hypertension (p < 0.001) and diabetes mellitus (p < 0.001), acute kidney injury (AKI), which was found to be associated with mortality (p < 0.001), and mortality (p < 0.001)]. In multivariate regression analysis, CKD stage 3-5, AKI, male gender, hypertension, DM and malignancy were found to be significant independent variables increasing mortality. CONCLUSION: The prevelance of CKD stage 3-5 on admission is associated with a high risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. Close follow-up can be recommended for patients with a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR).","Gok, Mahmut; Cetinkaya, Hakki; Kandemir, Tugba; Karahan, Erdem; Tuncer, Izzet Burak; Bukrek, Cengiz; Sahin, Gulizar",Int. urol. nephrol,216,21

Methods: A multicenter retrospective cohort study compared males versus females with COVID-19 infections from March 1, 2020, to June 21, 2020, in the Rush University System. We analyzed sex differences in rates of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, vasopressor use, endotracheal intubation, and death in this cohort. A multivariable model correcting for age and sum of comorbidities was used to explore associations between sex and COVID-19-related outcomes. Results: There were 8108 positive COVID-19 patients-4300 (53.0%) females and 3808 (47.0%) males. Males had higher rates of hospitalization (19% vs. 13%; p < 0.001), ICU transfer (8% vs. 4%; p < 0.001), vasopressor support (4% vs. 2%; p < 0.001), and endotracheal intubation (5% vs. 2%; p < 0.001).

However, it is currently unknown which, if any, breast cancers are capable of progressing during a few to several months of observation. The difference between clinical size at diagnosis and final pathology size was assessed in 315 stage I-III primary invasive breast cancer patients who were divided into three groups based on the time between diagnosis and definitive surgery. Size differences over time were used to estimate specific growth rates. Compared with the group with &#8804;60 days between diagnosis and surgery, tumor growth was observed for 12% of tumors in the 61- to 120-day group and 17% of tumors in the >120-day group (p for trend = 0.032). Significantly greater specific growth rates were observed for tumors >2 cm by pathology measurement and for pathology node-positive patients (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.006, respectively). Specific growth rates were significantly greater for luminal B breast cancers than for luminal A breast cancers (p = 0.029) but not for triple-negative or HER2-positive breast cancers not selected for neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. There was no evidence of nodal progression with surgery delay. Fewer than 20% of stage I-III breast cancers not selected for neo-adjuvant chemotherapy evidence size progression during follow-up periods ranging from 61 to 294 days. Clinical-pathological features cannot reliably predict which tumors will grow. Luminal B phenotype was the only clinical variable known at the time of diagnosis that strongly predicted growth. If resource limitations mandate prioritization schemes for breast cancer surgery, luminal B breast cancer may be the highest priority.","Alaidy, Ziad; Mohamed, Ahmed; Euhus, David",Breast j,216,1

A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1158 healthcare students across five medical universities in February 2020. Acute stress disorder was assessed using the Stanford Acute Stress Response Questionnaire. Further data regarding COVID-19 knowledge, individual behaviours, occupational choices, and career planning were collected. Based on the results of the Stanford Acute Stress Response Questionnaire, the students were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups for acute stress disorder. The correlation between acute stress disorder and the impact on career planning was analysed. The high-risk group comprised 143 (12.3%) participants, while 1015 (87.7%) participants were in the low-risk group. Two factors increased the risk of acute stress disorder in the students, including 'I think the pandemic is far away from me' (B: 1.27, 95%CI: 1.60-7.87) and 'Physical contact with confirmed or suspected cases' (B: 2.49, 95%CI: 3.42-42.44). Those who obtained pandemic information from official media sources indicated a lower risk of acute stress disorder (B: -0.24, 95%CI: 0.49-1.26). The high-risk group was more likely to quit the medical profession after graduation. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause acute stress disorder among healthcare students and affect their career planning. Universities and relevant departments should provide more information and moral support for these students.","Zhang, Luping; Qi, Hongbo; Wang, Longqiong; Wang, Fulan; Huang, Jin; Li, Feifei; Zhang, Zhiwei",Int. j. ment. health nurs,216,21

The paper explores the surge in activity from March through June 2020 in two massive open online classes (MOOCs) on Astronomy, offered by Coursera and Udemy. The increase in enrollment in both classes was an order of magnitude over the similar time span in previous years. Learners enrolling during the pandemic were more likely to be younger than thirty and less likely to have advanced degrees. A majority were full-time undergraduate students, and relatively few were professionals working in technical fields. The largest number of new students were from India and overall, the biggest surge in enrollment came from people in developing countries, particularly in Asia. Those who enrolled during the pandemic were more likely to take the course to get a certificate or to further their career goals than because they had intrinsic interest in the subject. Social motivations were important, particularly among full-time students in the course. These results, albeit limited to MOOCs in astronomy, suggest that new audiences have been turning to online classes during the pandemic for gaining credentials or advancing their professional skills.","Impey, Chris Formanek Martin",Social Sciences &amp; Humanities Open,216,10

Clinical characteristics and risk factors for retesting positive have not been studied extensively. Methods: In this retrospective, single-center cohort study, we included adult patients (≥ 18 years old) diagnosed as COVID-19 in Affiliated Yueqing Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang, China. All the patients were discharged before March 31, 2020, and were re-tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) after meeting the discharge criteria. We retrospectively analyzed this cohort of 117 discharged patients and analyzed the differences between retest positive and negative patients in terms of demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT) features and treatment procedures. Findings: Compared with the negative group, the positive group had a higher proportion of patients with comorbidities (Odds Ratio(OR) =2·12, 95% Confidence Interval(CI) 0·48–9·46; p = 0·029), longer hospital stay (OR=1·21, 95% CI 1·07–1·36; p = 0·008), a higher proportion of patients with lymphocytopenia (p = 0·036), a higher proportion of antibiotics treatment (p = 0·008) and glucocorticoids treatment (p = 0·003). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of positive SARS-CoV-2 retest after discharge associated with longer hospital stay (OR=1·22, 95% CI 1·08–1·38; p = 0·001), and lymphocytopenia (OR=7·74, 95% CI 1·70–35·21; p = 0·008) on admission. Interpretation: Patients with COVID-19 who met discharge criteria could still test positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

This study reports the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on appetite and overeating in Australian adults during the first month of emergency measures. DESIGN: This study reports analysis of data from the population-based, self-completed survey. The main outcome measure was an item from the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 asking: 'Over the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by poor appetite or overeating?'. Data on sociodemographic factors, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations with poor appetite or overeating. SETTING: An anonymous online survey available from 3 April to 2 May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 13 829 Australian residents aged 18 years or over. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating in the past 2 weeks was 53·6 %, with 11·6 % (95 % CI 10·6, 12·6) of the cohort reporting poor appetite or overeating nearly every day. High levels of anxiety, concern about contracting COVID-19, being in lockdown with children and reporting a severe impact of the lockdown were associated with increased odds of poor appetite or overeating. CONCLUSIONS: Given the widespread prevalence of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating, universal public health interventions to address emotion-focused or situational eating during periods of lockdown may be appropriate.","Owen, A J; Tran, T; Hammarberg, K; Kirkman, M; Fisher, Jrw",Public Health Nutr,216,24

To develop effective therapeutic antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, it is critical to understand the interaction between viral and host's proteins. The human ACE2 (hACE2) protein is the crucial target for the SARS-CoV's Spike protein that allows the virus to adhere to host epithelial cells. X-ray crystal structures and biophysical properties of protein-protein interactions reveal a large interaction surface with high binding-affinity between SARS-CoV-2 and hACE2 (18 interactions), at least 15-fold stronger than between SARS-CoV-1 and hACE2 (eight interactions). This suggests that antibodies against CoV-1 infection might not be very efficient against CoV-2. Furthermore, interspecies comparisons indicate that ACE2 proteins of man and cat are far closer than dog, ferret, mouse, and rat with significant differences in binding-affinity between Spike and ACE2 proteins. This strengthens the notion of productive SARS-CoV-2 transmission between felines and humans and that classical animal models are not optimally suited for evaluating therapeutic antibodies. The large interaction surface with strong affinity between SARS-CoV-2 and hACE2 (dG-12.4) poses a huge challenge to develop reliable antibody therapy that truly blocks SARS-CoV-2 adherence and infection. We gauge that single antibodies against single epitopes might not sufficiently interfere with the strong interaction-synapse between Spike and hACE2 proteins. Instead, appropriate combinations of high-affinity neutralizing antibodies against different epitopes might be needed, preferably of IgA-class for optimal and prolonged activity at epithelial layers of respiratory and intestine tracts.","Khatri, Indu; Staal, Frank J T; van Dongen, Jacques J M",Front Immunol,216,1

Using National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) data from January 6, 2019-September 6, 2020, CDC tabulated weekly numbers of emergency department (ED) visits related to child abuse and neglect and calculated the proportions of such visits per 100,000 ED visits, as well as the percentage of suspected or confirmed ED visits related to child abuse and neglect ending in hospitalization, overall and stratified by age group (0-4, 5-11, and 12-17 years). The total number of ED visits related to child abuse and neglect began decreasing below the corresponding 2019 period during week 11 (March 15-March 22, 2020) for all age groups examined, coinciding with the declaration of a national emergency on March 13 (2); simultaneously, the proportion of these visits per 100,000 ED visits began increasing above the 2019 baseline for all age groups. Despite decreases in the weekly number of ED visits related to child abuse and neglect, the weekly number of these visits resulting in hospitalization remained stable in 2020; however, the yearly percentage of ED visits related to child abuse and neglect resulting in hospitalization increased significantly among all age groups. Although the increased proportion of ED visits related to child abuse and neglect might be associated with a decrease in the overall number of ED visits, these findings also suggest that health care-seeking patterns have shifted during the pandemic. Hospitalizations for child abuse and neglect did not decrease in 2020, suggesting that injury severity did not decrease during the pandemic, despite decreased ED visits. Child abuse is preventable; implementation of strategies including strengthening household economic supports and creating family-friendly work policies can reduce stress during difficult times and increase children's opportunities to thrive in safe, stable, and nurturing relationships and environments (3).","Swedo, Elizabeth; Idaikkadar, Nimi; Leemis, Ruth; Dias, Taylor; Radhakrishnan, Lakshmi; Stein, Zachary; Chen, May; Agathis, Nickolas; Holland, Kristin",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,216,16

Clinical efficacy of heparin is due to its interaction with antithrombin (AT) that may be decreased in COVID-19. Therefore, we correlated AT levels with outcomes of COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: We recruited 49 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19. AT levels were significantly lower in 16 non-survivors than in 33 survivors (72.2 ± 23.4 versus 94.6 ± 19.5%; p = 0.0010). A multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that low AT (levels below 80%) was a predictor of mortality (HR:3.97; 95%CI:1.38 to 11.43; p = 0.0103). BMI was the only variable that showed a significant difference between patients with low and those with normal AT levels (32.9 ± 7.9 versus 27.5 ± 5.9%; p = 0.0104). AT levels were significantly lower in obese patients than in subjects with normal weight or overweight (77.9 ± 26.9 versus 91.4 ± 26.9 versus 91.4 ± 17.1%; p = 0.025). An inverse correlation between AT levels and BMI was documented (r:-0.33; p = 0.0179). CONCLUSIONS: Our data first suggest that AT is strongly associated with mortality in COVID-19. In addition, AT may be the link between obesity and a poorer prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Other studies should confirm whether AT may become a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target in COVID-19.","Gazzaruso, Carmine; Paolozzi, Enrico; Valenti, Cinzia; Brocchetta, Mauro; Naldani, Daniela; Grignani, Claudio; Salvucci, Fabrizio; Marino, Francesco; Coppola, Adriana; Gallotti, Pietro",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,216,12

PCR is an accurate method to detect SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, but PCR lab test kits are scarce and expensive resources. Therefore, their usage should be optimized. Testing in batch (pooling) is a procedure that merges individuals' swabs, allowing group diagnosis without affecting the accuracy of the results. Savings on test kits depend on the prevalence of the disease, pool composition and size. We propose a novel approach for optimizing pooling to minimize the usage of lab test kits. We show that estimating the probability of an individual being infected by means of a binary classifier leads to improvements in the efficiency of pooling strategies. We use simulation to select the components of a new pooling strategy based on a classifier and evaluate our approach using a real dataset. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

While people may take many preventive behaviours to minimize the risk, very little is known about the factors that can increase preventive behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined the effects of vulnerability, perceived risk, and fear on preventive behaviours of COVID-19. The study used a sample of 4,536 Turkish adults (M = 30.33 ± 10.95 years) recruited from 17 March through 1 April 2020. Vulnerability, perceived risk, fear, and preventive behaviours were measured with self-rating scales. Participants mostly engaged in avoidance of public transportation and frequent handwashing as preventive behaviours. Women had a significantly higher vulnerability to, perceived risk, and fear of new coronavirus compared to men. Correlation results indicated that age, gender, education level, vulnerability, perceived risk, and fear were related to preventive behaviours. Regression results demonstrated that vulnerability, perceived risk, and fear accounted for a significant amount of variance in preventive behaviours over and above the effects of demographic variables. The results suggest that vulnerability, perceived risk, and fear can significantly increase engagement in preventive behaviours during the novel coronavirus pandemic. The results have important implications for research and practice.","Yildirim, Murat; Geçer, Ekmel; Akgül, Ömer",Psychol Health Med,216,1

We present seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and correlates of seropositivity immediately after the first wave. METHODS: From a serosurvey of adult NYC residents (May 13-July 21, 2020), we calculated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies stratified by participant demographics, symptom history, health status, and employment industry. We used multivariable regression models to assess associations between participant characteristics and seropositivity. RESULTS: Seroprevalence among 45,367 participants was 23.6% (95% CI, 23.2%-24.0%). High seroprevalence (>30%) was observed among Black and Hispanic individuals, people from high poverty neighborhoods, and people in health care or essential worker industry sectors. COVID-19 symptom history was associated with seropositivity (adjusted relative risk=2.76; 95% CI, 2.65-2.88). Other risk factors included sex, age, race/ethnicity, residential area, employment sector, working outside the home, contact with a COVID-19 case, obesity, and increasing numbers of household members. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a large serosurvey in a single U.S. jurisdiction, we estimate that just under one-quarter of NYC adults were infected in the first few months of the COVID-19 epidemic.

More than 10 million affected cases and more than half a million deaths have been reported so far, while no vaccine is yet available as a treatment. Considering the global healthcare urgency, several techniques, including whole genome sequencing and computed tomography imaging have been employed for diagnosing infected people. Considerable efforts are also directed at detecting and preventing different modes of community transmission. Among them is the rapid detection of virus presence on different surfaces with which people may come in contact. Detection based on non-contact optical techniques is very helpful in managing the spread of the virus, and to aid in the disinfection of surfaces. Nanomaterial-based methods are proven suitable for rapid detection. Given the immense need for science led innovative solutions, this manuscript critically reviews recent literature to specifically illustrate nano-engineered effective and rapid solutions. In addition, all the different techniques are critically analyzed, compared, and contrasted to identify the most promising methods. Moreover, promising research ideas for high accuracy of detection in trace concentrations, via color change and light-sensitive nanostructures, to assist fingerprint techniques (to identify the virus at the contact surface of the gas and solid phase) are also presented.","Rabiee, Navid; Bagherzadeh, Mojtaba; Ghasemi, Amir; Zare, Hossein; Ahmadi, Sepideh; Fatahi, Yousef; Dinarvand, Rassoul; Rabiee, Mohammad; Ramakrishna, Seeram; Shokouhimehr, Mohammadreza; Varma, Rajender S",Int. j. mol. sci.

Since then, the disease has spread worldwide. As it currently spreading in the United States, policy makers, public health officials and citizens are racing to understand the impact of this virus on the United States healthcare system. They fear that the rapid influx of patients will overwhelm the healthcare system leading to unnecessary fatalities. Most countries and states in America have introduced mitigation strategies, such as social distancing, to decrease the rate of newly infected people, i.e. flattening the curve.In this paper, we analyze the time evolution of the number of people hospitalized due to the coronavirus using the methods of queueing theory. Given that the rate of new infections varies over time as the pandemic evolves, we model the number of coronavirus patients as a dynamical system based on the theory of infinite server queues with non-stationary Poisson arrival rates. With this model we are able to quantify how flattening the curve affects the peak demand for hospital resources. This allows us to characterize how aggressively society must flatten the curve in order to avoid overwhelming the capacity of healthcare system. We also demonstrate how flattening the curve impacts the elapsed time between the peak rate of hospitalizations and the time of the peak demand for the hospital resources. Finally, we present empirical evidence from China, South Korea, Italy and the United States that supports the insights from the model.","Palomo, Sergio; Pender, Jamol; Massey, William; Hampshire, Robert C.",,216,16

Estimates of the basic reproduction number were found to be larger than 1 in both countries, with values being between 2 and 3 for Italy, and 2.5 and 4 for Spain. Estimates were also computed for the more dynamic effective reproduction number, which showed that since the first cases were confirmed in the respective countries the severity has generally been decreasing.

We performed a retrospective comparative observational study using the French Pharmacovigilance network database between 1985 and May 2020 to assess all postmarketing CADR associated with hydroxychloroquine notified before COVID-19 in its approved indications for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis (preCOV), and those concerning its empirical use in COVID-19 (COV). Eighty-five CADR in preCOV were compared to 141 CADR in COV. The most common CADR of preCOV were cardiomyopathies (42.4%) and conduction disorders (28.2%), both statistically more frequent than in COV (P<0.001). COV notifications significantly highlighted repolarization and ventricular rhythm disorders (78.0%, P<0.001) as well as sinus bradycardias (14.9%, P= 0.01) as compared with preCOV. Estimated incidence of CADR was significantly higher among patients exposed to off-label use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 (2.9%) than before COVID-19 in its approved indications (0.01%, P<0.001).

With recent advancements in oncology, immunotherapy is an emerging cause of pneumonitis. Atezolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) that targets PD-L1 to prevent the interaction with receptors PD-1 and B7-1, thus reversing T-cell suppression and can cause pneumonitis due to the inflammatory response. It has an incidence of up to 10%. Symptoms can include dyspnea (53%), cough (35%), fever (12%), and chest pain (7%). CASE: An 81-year-old male with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab, intra-lesional hematoma, and portal vein thrombosis presented with one day of dyspnea. In the ED, he was found to be hypoxic to 80% on room air. The examination was unremarkable except for bilateral crackles on auscultation. Laboratory tests including complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function tests, kidney function tests, and arterial blood gas were within normal limits. CT chest revealed bilateral multifocal airspace opacities. Due to the acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, he was transferred to the ICU for care. Blood cultures were sent. Antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin was initiated for presumed community-acquired pneumonia. The patient continued to worsen clinically. All initial infectious workup was negative including blood cultures, tuberculosis and fungal workup, and respiratory viral pathogen PCR. COVID-19 and influenza PCR was negative thrice. Of note, the patient completed his second cycle of immunotherapy with Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab, four days prior to admission. He was started on methylprednisolone 2mg/kg/d on hospital day (HD) 5 for likely ICI-induced pneumonitis. Despite steroid therapy, no clinical improvement was noted. He was additionally given a single dose of infliximab 5mg/kg to which he improved clinically initially. However, he later grew Aspergillus in his bronchoalveolar lavage and passed away from multi-organ failure on HD 22. DISCUSSION: We describe a case of HCC with hematoma. Given the risk of bleeding with first-line therapy (Sorafenib), a combination of Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab was used instead. ICI-induced pneumonitis is a diagnosis of exclusion with no specific clinical picture or radiologic findings. Anti-VEGF antibodies like Bevacizumab are more likely to cause pulmonary hemorrhage than pneumonitis. ICI-induced pneumonitis is divided into 4 grades. This patient was categorized as Grade 3. The patient received infliximab as he did not respond to initial therapy consisting of empirical antibiotics and IV methylprednisolone. In patients on ICI, who present with respiratory symptoms, clinicians should have a high degree of suspicion for pneumonitis. Early diagnosis and treatment could potentially reduce mortality.","Shah, D. J.; Lo Cascio, C. M.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,216,26

Therefore, an effort should be made to improve the quality and robustness of the annotation despite of the challenges, especially when final identification with standards is not possible. Through non-targeted analysis of human plasma samples, from a large cancer cohort study using RP-LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS, we have resolved MS/MS annotation through spectral matching, directed to hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and, MS/MS structural elucidation for newly annotated oxidized lyso-phosphatidylcholines (oxLPCs). The annotation of unknowns is supported with structural information from fragmentation spectra as well as the fragmentation mechanisms involved, necessarily including data from both polarity modes and different collision energies. In this work, we present evidences that various oxidation products show significant differences between cancer patients and control individuals and we establish a workflow to help identify such modifications. We report here the upregulation of HETEs and oxLPCs in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to determine HETEs in NETs and one of very few studies where oxLPCs are annotated.

Here we map how all mutations to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 affect binding by the antibodies in the REGN-COV2 cocktail and the antibody LY-CoV016. These complete maps uncover a single amino acid mutation that fully escapes the REGN-COV2 cocktail, which consists of two antibodies, REGN10933 and REGN10987, targeting distinct structural epitopes. The maps also identify viral mutations that are selected in a persistently infected patient treated with REGN-COV2 and during in vitro viral escape selections. Finally, the maps reveal that mutations escaping the individual antibodies are already present in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. These complete escape maps enable interpretation of the consequences of mutations observed during viral surveillance.","Starr, Tyler N; Greaney, Allison J; Addetia, Amin; Hannon, William W; Choudhary, Manish C; Dingens, Adam S; Li, Jonathan Z; Bloom, Jesse D",Science,216,24

The two subscales, Cultural Factors Shape Stigma (CFSS) and Cultural Capabilities Protect against Stigma (CCPS) were reliable (both [Formula: see text]). Among WLHIV, the CFSS Subscale showed initial construct validity with depressive symptoms (r = .39, p = .005), similar to an established HIV stigma scale, whereas the CCPS Subscale showed initial construct validity with self-esteem (r = .32, p = .026) and social support number (r = .29, p = .047), suggesting that achieving local cultural capabilities mitigates stigma and is linked with positive psychosocial outcomes.

METHODS: All probands were subjected to next generation sequencing (NGS). Suspected variant were verified by Sanger sequencing among the family members. Prenatal diagnosis was provided for three couples through Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: All probands were found to carry pathogenic variants of the TMC1 gene, which included c.100C>T (p.R34X) and c.642+4A>C in family 1, c.582G>A (p.W194X) and c.589G>A (p.G197R) in family 2, c.1396_1398delAAC and c.1571T>C (p.F524S) in family 3, and homozygosity of c.2050G>C (p.D684H) in family 4. All parents were heterozygous carriers of the variants. The c.642+4A>C and c.1571T>C (p.F524S) were unreported previously. Prenatal diagnosis revealed that none of the fetuses were affected. Follow-up confirmed that all newborns had normal hearing. CONCLUSION: Variant of the TMC1 gene probably underlay the deafness in the four families. Above findings have enhanced our understanding of the function of the TMC1 gene and enriched its variant spectrum. The results also facilitated genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis for the families.","Ren, Shumin; Chen, Chen; Kong, Xiangdong",Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,216,29

BACKGROUND: Work engagement and sense of coherence can help professionals to cope with work-related psychological distress due to the harsh conditions of the COVID-19 working environment. METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study of 1,459 health care professionals. The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, the Sense of Coherence Scale and Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire were distributed and analysed with descriptive and multiple linear regression methods. RESULTS: High levels of work engagement, especially in the dedication dimension, of sense of coherence, in particular in the meaningfulness dimension, and psychological distress were obtained. Significant correlations (p < .001) were identified between all the variables. CONCLUSIONS: Work engagement and sense of coherence correlated positively with each other and both negatively with psychological distress. So, health care professionals, despite presenting psychological distress, perceive their work satisfactorily and positively despite the severity of the situation and the harsh conditions. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Sense of coherence and work engagement are protective factors against psychological distress.

METHODS: All children with highly suspected COVID-19 were included. Anti-nucleoprotein SARS-CoV-2 were measured using SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA kits. Hypothesis testing was carried out through SPSS to unravel any association between the measurement tools and important clinical and laboratory characteristics. RESULTS: In this study, 254 patients were evaluated and 117 cases (46%) were male. The nucleic acid detection results for patient 55 were negative, but the IgM and IgG results were positive. Totally, 190 patients were tested for IgM in which only 14 (7.3%) had positive tests. Positive IgG was detected in 51 (20%) out of 254 patients; among them, 30 patients had negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (59%).

With the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in reports associating cardiotoxicity with hydroxychloroquine. It is unclear if cardiotoxic profile of hydroxychloroquine is previously underreported in the literature, or a new manifestation of COVID-19 and therapeutic interventions. This manuscript evaluates the incidence of cardiotoxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine prior to onset of COVID-19. METHODS: PubMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for keywords derived from MeSH terms, prior to 4/9/2020. Inclusion eligibility was based on appropriate reporting of cardiac conditions and study design. RESULTS: Sixty-nine articles were identified (58 case reports, 11 case series). Majority (84%) of patients were female, with a median age of 49.2(range 16-92) years. Fifteen of 185 patients with cardiotoxic events were in the setting of acute intentional overdose. In acute overdose, the median ingestion was 17,857 ï± 14,873 mg. Two of 15 patients died after acute intoxication. In patients with long-term hydroxychloroquine use (10.5 ± 8.9 years), new onset systolic heart failure occurred in 54 of 155 patients (35%) with median cumulative ingestion of 1,493,800 ± 995,517 mg. The majority of patients improved with withdrawal of hydroxychloroquine and standard therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Millions of hydroxychloroquine doses are prescribed annually. Prior to COVID-19 pandemic, cardiac complications attributed to hydroxychloroquine were uncommon. Further studies are needed to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system to understand presence or absence of potential medication interactions with hydroxychloroquine in this new pathophysiological state.","Fram, Georgi; Wang, Dee Dee; Malette, Kelly; Villablanca, Pedro; Kang, Guson; So, Kent; Basir, Mir B; Khan, Arfaat; McKinnon, John E; Zervos, Marcus; O039,; Neill, William W",Current cardiology reviews (Online),216,21

While some SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals present as asymptomatic, others exhibit mild symptoms that may include fever, cough, chills, and unusual symptoms like loss of taste and smell and reddening in the extremities (e.g., ""COVID toes"", suggestive of microvessel damage). Still others alarm healthcare providers with extreme and rapid onset of high-risk indicators of mortality that include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ hypercoagulation, hypoxia and cardiovascular damage. Researchers are quickly refocusing their science to address this enigmatic virus that seems to unveil itself in new ways without discrimination. As investigators begin to identify early markers of disease, identification of common threads with other pathologies may provide some clues. Interestingly, years of research in the field of radiation biology documents the complex multi-organ nature of another disease state that occurs after exposure to high doses of radiation: the acute radiation syndrome (ARS). Inflammation is a key common player in COVID-19 and ARS, and drives the multi-system damage that dramatically alters biological homeostasis. Both conditions initiate a cytokine storm, with similar pro-inflammatory molecules increased and other anti-inflammatory molecules decreased. These changes manifest in a variety of ways, with a demonstrably higher health impact in patients having underlying medical conditions. The potentially dramatic human impact of ARS has guided the science that has identified many biomarkers of radiation exposure, established medical management strategies for ARS, and led to the development of medical countermeasures for use in the event of a radiation public health emergency. These efforts can now be leveraged to help elucidate mechanisms of action of COVID-19 injuries. Furthermore, this intersection between COVID-19 and ARS may point to approaches that could accelerate the discovery of treatments for both.","Rios, Carmen I; Cassatt, David R; Hollingsworth, Brynn A; Satyamitra, Merriline M; Tadesse, Yeabsera S; Taliaferro, Lanyn P; Winters, Thomas A; DiCarlo, Andrea L",Radiat. res,216,14

CONCLUSION: Patients with anterior skull base defects may be at risk with current COVID-19 testing protocols, and may benefit from alternative specimen collection strategies.","Aaronson, Daniel M; Poetker, David M; Long, Christopher M; Zwagerman, Nathan T",World Neurosurg,216,26

As strongly argued by Green in his book Smart Enough City, the incorporation of technology in city environs does not automatically translate into prosperity, wellbeing, urban livability, or social justice. There is a great need to deliberate on the future of the cities worth living and designing. There are philosophical and ethical questions involved along with various challenges that relate to the security, safety, and interpretability of AI algorithms that will form the technological bedrock of future cities. Several research institutes on human centered AI have been established at top international universities. Globally there are calls for technology to be made more humane and human-compatible. For example, Stuart Russell has a book called Human Compatible AI. The Center for Humane Technology advocates for regulators and technology companies to avoid business models and product features that contribute to social problems such as extremism, polarization, misinformation, and Internet addiction. In this paper, we analyze and explore key challenges including security, robustness, interpretability, and ethical challenges to a successful deployment of AI or ML in human-centric applications, with a particular emphasis on the convergence of these challenges. We provide a detailed review of existing literature on these key challenges and analyze how one of these challenges may lead to others or help in solving other challenges. The paper also advises on the current limitations, pitfalls, and future directions of research in these domains, and how it can fill the current gaps and lead to better solutions.","Ahmad, Kashif; Maabreh, Majdi; Ghaly, Mohamed; Khan, Khalil; Qadir, Junaid; Al-Fuqaha, Ala",,216,16

The project was subsequently extended to ten Italian Regions. This led to the creation of the VaccinarSì Network, whose websites are publicly owned. The aim of this work was to present the framework of the websites of the VaccinarSì Network and to analyse user behaviour in the pre-COVID-19-era (dating from each website's publication until 31 January 2020) and in the COVID-19-era (from 1 February 2020 to 31 January 2021). Some metrics such as the number of visits to the site (sessions, number of users and average session duration), user behaviour (pages viewed, bounce rate and organic search) and the session acquisition path (direct traffic, referrals and social traffic) were searched, extrapolated and processed with Google Analytics. Qualitative and normally distributed quantitative variables were summarised with their absolute (relative) frequencies and means. Statistical differences between the means of the two periods were evaluated through paired t-test. A two-tailed p-value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. When the total values recorded over the period were compared, an overall increase in metrics was observed-the number of individual users, visits and individual pageviews rose in a statistically significant way. Our study aimed to highlight how combining disciplines such as health education and digital communication via Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) represents the best strategy to support citizens. This approach gives them the tools to become independent and responsible players that are capable of voluntarily and consciously choosing to adhere to vaccination programs. The VaccinarSì Network's goal for the future is to reach an even wider audience.

METHODS: We performed a literature search to answer four key questions. The committee graded the evidence and developed recommendations by using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. QUESTIONS ADDRESSED BY THE GUIDELINE AND RECOMMENDATIONS: We assessed evidence on the risk of bacterial infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the associated bacterial pathogens, how to diagnose bacterial infections and how to treat bacterial infections. Bacterial co-infection upon admission was reported in 3.5% of COVID-19 patients, while bacterial secondary infections during hospitalization occurred up to 15%. No or very low quality evidence was found to answer the other key clinical questions. Although the evidence base on bacterial infections in COVID-19 is currently limited, available evidence supports restrictive antibiotic use from an antibiotic stewardship perspective, especially upon admission. To support restrictive antibiotic use, maximum efforts should be undertaken to obtain sputum and blood culture samples as well as pneumococcal urinary antigen testing. We suggest to stop antibiotics in patients who started antibiotic treatment upon admission when representative cultures as well as urinary antigen tests show no signs of involvement of bacterial pathogens after 48 hours. For patients with secondary bacterial respiratory infection we recommend to follow other guideline recommendations on antibacterial treatment for patients with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia. An antibiotic treatment duration of five days in patients with COVID-19 and suspected bacterial respiratory infection is recommended upon improvement of signs, symptoms and inflammatory markers. Larger, prospective studies about the epidemiology of bacterial infections in COVID-19 are urgently needed to confirm our conclusions and ultimately prevent unnecessary antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sieswerda, Elske; de Boer, Mark G J; Bonten, Marc M J; Boersma, Wim G; Jonkers, René E; Aleva, Roel M; Kullberg, Bart-Jan; Schouten, Jeroen A; van de Garde, Ewoudt M W; Verheij, Theo J; van der Eerden, Menno M; Prins, Jan M; Wiersinga, W Joost",Clin. microbiol. infect,216,16

However, almost all of the reported viral RdRp inhibitors (either repurposed or new antiviral drugs) lack specific selectivity against the novel coronaviral RdRp and still at a beginning phase of advancement. Herein, I discovered and introduce a new pyrazine derivative, (E)-N-(4-cyanobenzylidene)-6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide (cyanorona-20), as the first potent SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitor with very high selectivity (209- and 45-fold more potent than favipiravir and remdesivir, respectively). This promising selective specific anti-COVID-19 compound is also deemed to be the first distinctive derivative of favipiravir. Cyanorona-20, the unprecedented nucleoside/nucleotide analog, was designed, synthesized, characterized, computationally studied, and biologically evaluated for its anti-COVID-19 actions (through a precise in vitro anti-COVID-19 assay). The results of the biological assay displayed that cyanorona-20 surprisingly exhibited very high and largely significant anti-COVID-19 activities (anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC50 = 0.45 µM), and, in addition, it could be also a very promising guide and lead compound for the design and synthesis of new anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-COVID-19 agents through structural modifications and further computational studies. Further appraisal for the improvement of cyanorona-20 medication is a prerequisite requirement in the coming days. In a word, the ascent of the second member (cyanorona-20 ""Corona Antidote"") of the novel and promising class of anti-COVID-19 pyrazine derivatives would drastically make a medical uprising in the pharmacotherapeutic treatment regimens and protocols of the recently-emerged SARS-CoV-2 infection and its accompanying COVID-19.","Rabie, Amgad M",Int Immunopharmacol,216,33

Prior to the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the availability of telemedicine in health systems and coverage of telemedicine were variable. Sudden and improved access to telemedicine was propelled by the COVID-19 pandemic, during which governments, insurers, and health systems ramped up telemedical utilization with short-term exceptions and waivers. As in-person care opportunities open back up, the presence of telemedicine is not receding and thus its widespread adoption needs to be facilitated outside pandemic-specific conditions. Long-term funding for telemedicine acquisition, centralized electronic health records, extended waivers related to telemedicine coverage and use, a Medicaid expansion that involves parity in telemedicine and in-person care, a nationalized licensure system, and an assessment of what types of care settings can and cannot utilize telemedicine are necessary recommendations to improve the sustainability of telemedicine after the pandemic.","Kaundinya, Trisha; Agrawal, Rishi",Qual. manage. health care,216,16

Beside the ever-increasing need for high capacity radio links, reliability and latency constraints challenge the mobile network supply. While for example the millimeter-wave spectrum and THz-bands offer a vast amount of radio resources, their applicability is limited due to delicate radio channel conditions and signal propagation characteristics. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) as part of smart radio environments (SREs) of future ITS infrastructure promise improved radio link qualities by means of purposeful cultivation of passive reflections. With this, obstructed mmWave or THz beams can be guided around obstacles through RIS reflection paths to improve the otherwise limited coverage. In this article, application use cases of RIS-enhanced vehicular communications are proposed. Beside static deployments of RISs at exterior walls of buildings, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) could provide reflection capabilities on demand, while future vehicles could - in a visionary approach - consist of meta-material allowing for their opportunistic utilization within an enriched SRE. Results of a case study based on our multi-scale mobility and network simulation model clearly highlight the potential of RIS deployment for hybrid vehicular communication scenarios.

It is important to quantify the error rates of test equipment under field conditions, which might differ significantly from those obtained in the laboratory.

A simple correction method for bulk test results is then demonstrated with examples. The required sensitivity and specificity of a test are explored for societal needs and use cases, before a sequential analysis of common example scenarios is explored. The analysis suggests that many of the people with mild symptoms and positive test results are unlikely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in some regions. It is concluded that current and foreseen alternative tests can not be used to ""clear"" people as being non-infected. Recommendations are given that regional authorities must establish a programme to monitor operational test characteristics before launching large scale testing;and that large scale testing for tracing infection networks in some regions is not viable, but may be possible in a focused way that does not exceed the working capacity of the laboratories staffed by competent experts. RT-PCR tests can not be solely relied upon as the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis at scale, instead clinical assessment supported by a range of expert diagnostic tests should be used.","Bentley, P.

There are many causes of rhabdomyolysis, and the etiology is often multifactorial or unclear. Current data suggest that acute COVID-19 may cause muscle injury that can lead to rhabdomyolysis, particularly in cases of severe illness requiring prolonged hospitalization; however, data on the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the musculoskeletal system are lacking. CASE REPORT We present a case of a woman with generalized weakness 1 week following discharge from the hospital after a prolonged admission for severe COVID-19. She was found to have acute kidney injury and elevated creatine kinase (CK) of 1775 U/L (normal 36-234 U/L). Her home medications, including her statin, were held, but her CK continued to rise, peaking at 15 085 U/L, and she developed renal failure necessitating renal replacement therapy. A thorough work-up for the underlying etiology of her rhabdomyolysis was pursued, including testing for autoimmune myositis, statin-associated necrotizing autoimmune myositis, and a muscle biopsy, which were all unrevealing. Ultimately, the patient's rhabdomyolysis was determined to likely be secondary to a post-viral myopathy from COVID-19. A toxic myopathy from medication use or a delayed critical illness myopathy from her recent prolonged hospitalization could have also contributed. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the wide differential diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis in the setting of recent COVID-19 and prolonged hospitalization. It demonstrates the possibility that muscle injury and resultant rhabdomyolysis may be a late complication of COVID-19 that is not yet fully described in the literature.","Byler, Julie; Harrison, Rebecca; Fell, Lindsey L",Am J Case Rep,216,20

METHODS: We measured antibodies in serum samples from 30,576 persons in Iceland, using six assays (including two pan-immunoglobulin [pan-Ig] assays), and we determined that the appropriate measure of seropositivity was a positive result with both pan-Ig assays. We tested 2102 samples collected from 1237 persons up to 4 months after diagnosis by a quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) assay. We measured antibodies in 4222 quarantined persons who had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and in 23,452 persons not known to have been exposed. RESULTS: Of the 1797 persons who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, 1107 of the 1215 who were tested (91.1%) were seropositive; antiviral antibody titers assayed by two pan-Ig assays increased during 2 months after diagnosis by qPCR and remained on a plateau for the remainder of the study. Of quarantined persons, 2.3% were seropositive; of those with unknown exposure, 0.3% were positive. We estimate that 0.9% of Icelanders were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and that the infection was fatal in 0.3%. We also estimate that 56% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections in Iceland had been diagnosed with qPCR, 14% had occurred in quarantined persons who had not been tested with qPCR (or who had not received a positive result, if tested), and 30% had occurred in persons outside quarantine and not tested with qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that antiviral antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 did not decline within 4 months after diagnosis. We estimate that the risk of death from infection was 0.3% and that 44% of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Iceland were not diagnosed by qPCR.","Gudbjartsson, Daniel F; Norddahl, Gudmundur L; Melsted, Pall; Gunnarsdottir, Kristbjorg; Holm, Hilma; Eythorsson, Elias; Arnthorsson, Asgeir O; Helgason, Dadi; Bjarnadottir, Kristbjorg; Ingvarsson, Ragnar F; Thorsteinsdottir, Brynja; Kristjansdottir, Steinunn; Birgisdottir, Kolbrun; Kristinsdottir, Anna M; Sigurdsson, Martin I; Arnadottir, Gudny A; Ivarsdottir, Erna V; Andresdottir, Margret; Jonsson, Frosti; Agustsdottir, Arna B; Berglund, Jonas; Eiriksdottir, Berglind; Fridriksdottir, Run; Gardarsdottir, Elisabet E; Gottfredsson, Magnus; Gretarsdottir, Olafia S; Gudmundsdottir, Steinunn; Gudmundsson, Kjartan R; Gunnarsdottir, Thora R; Gylfason, Arnaldur; Helgason, Agnar; Jensson, Brynjar O; Jonasdottir, Aslaug; Jonsson, Hakon; Kristjansson, Thordur; Kristinsson, Karl G; Magnusdottir, Droplaug N; Magnusson, Olafur T; Olafsdottir, Lovisa B; Rognvaldsson, Solvi; le Roux, Louise; Sigmundsdottir, Gudrun; Sigurdsson, Asgeir; Sveinbjornsson, Gardar; Sveinsdottir, Kristin E; Sveinsdottir, Maney; Thorarensen, Emil A; Thorbjornsson, Bjarni; Thordardottir, Marianna; Saemundsdottir, Jona",N Engl J Med,216,16

Clinical decision support (CDS) is critically important to chronic care providers, and CDS malfunction is common during times of change. It is essential to regularly reassess an organization's ambulatory CDS program to maintain care quality. This is especially true after an immense change, like the COVID-19 telemedicine expansion. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to reassess the ambulatory CDS program at a large academic medical center in light of telemedicine's expansion in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Our clinical informatics team devised a practical framework for an intrapandemic ambulatory CDS assessment focused on the impact of the telemedicine expansion. This assessment began with a quantitative analysis comparing CDS alert performance in the context of in-person and telemedicine visits. Board-certified physician informaticists then completed a formal workflow review of alerts with inferior performance in telemedicine visits. Informaticists then reported on themes and optimization opportunities through the existing CDS governance structure. RESULTS: Our assessment revealed that 10 of our top 40 alerts by volume were not firing as expected in telemedicine visits. In 3 of the top 5 alerts, providers were significantly less likely to take action in telemedicine when compared to office visits. Cumulatively, alerts in telemedicine encounters had an action taken rate of 5.3% (3257/64,938) compared to 8.3% (19,427/233,636) for office visits. Observations from a clinical informaticist workflow review included the following: (1) Telemedicine visits have different workflows than office visits. Some alerts developed for the office were not appearing at the optimal time in the telemedicine workflow. (2) Missing clinical data is a common reason for the decreased alert firing seen in telemedicine visits. (3) Remote patient monitoring and patient-reported clinical data entered through the portal could replace data collection usually completed in the office by a medical assistant or registered nurse. CONCLUSIONS: In a large academic medical center at the pandemic epicenter, an intrapandemic ambulatory CDS assessment revealed clinically significant CDS malfunctions that highlight the importance of reassessing ambulatory CDS performance after the telemedicine expansion.","Feldman, Jonah; Szerencsy, Adam; Mann, Devin; Austrian, Jonathan; Kothari, Ulka; Heo, Hye; Barzideh, Sam; Hickey, Maureen; Snapp, Catherine; Aminian, Rod; Jones, Lauren; Testa, Paul",JMIR Med Inform,216,10

METHODS AND RESULTS: COVID-19 patients at seven institutions receiving HCQ therapy from whom a baseline and at least one ECG at 48+ h were available were enrolled in the study. QT/QTc prolongation, QT-associated and QT-independent arrhythmic events, arrhythmic mortality, and overall mortality during HCQ therapy were assessed. A total of 649 COVID-19 patients (61.9 ± 18.7 years, 46.1% males) were enrolled. HCQ therapy was administrated as a home therapy regimen in 126 (19.4%) patients, and as an in-hospital-treatment to 495 (76.3%) hospitalized and 28 (4.3%) intensive care unit (ICU) patients. At 36-72 and at 96+ h after the first HCQ dose, 358 and 404 ECGs were obtained, respectively. A significant QT/QTc interval prolongation was observed (P < 0.001), but the magnitude of the increase was modest [+13 (9-16) ms]. Baseline QT/QTc length and presence of fever (P = 0.001) at admission represented the most important determinants of QT/QTc prolongation. No arrhythmic-related deaths were reported. The overall major ventricular arrhythmia rate was low (1.1%), with all events found not to be related to QT or HCQ therapy at a centralized event evaluation. No differences in QT/QTc prolongation and QT-related arrhythmias were observed across different clinical settings, with non-QT-related arrhythmias being more common in the intensive care setting. CONCLUSION: HCQ administration is safe for a short-term treatment for patients with COVID-19 infection regardless of the clinical setting of delivery, causing only modest QTc prolongation and no directly attributable arrhythmic deaths.","Gasperetti, Alessio; Biffi, Mauro; Duru, Firat; Schiavone, Marco; Ziacchi, Matteo; Mitacchione, Gianfranco; Lavalle, Carlo; Saguner, Ardan; Lanfranchi, Antonio; Casalini, Giacomo; Tocci, Marco; Fabbricatore, Davide; Salghetti, Francesca; Mariani, Marco Valerio; Busana, Mattia; Bellia, Alfonso; Cogliati, Chiara Beatrice; Viale, Pierluigi; Antinori, Spinello; Galli, Massimo; Galiè, Nazzareno; Tondo, Claudio; Forleo, Giovanni Battista",Europace,216,21

It is believed to block virus infection by increasing endosomal pH required for virus cell fusion and glycosylation of viral surface proteins. In addition to its antiviral activity, hydroxychloroquine has an immune-modulating activity that may synergistically enhance its antiviral effect in vivo, making it a potentially promising drug for the prevention and the cure of SARS-CoV-19. However, randomized controlled trials are needed to assess whether it can be used safely to treat COVID-19 patients or to prevent infection. The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for (I) the prevention of COVID-19 or related symptoms in SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects, such as as household members/contacts of COVID-19 patients and (II) the treatment of early-phase asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic COVID-19 patients. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a controlled, open label, cluster-randomized, superiority trial with parallel group design. Subjects will be randomized either to receive hydroxychloroquine or to observation (2:1). PARTICIPANTS: SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects, including household members and/or contacts of COVID-19 patients and healthcare professionals (Group 1) or patients with COVID-19 (positive PCR test on a rhinopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2), asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic in home situations who are not undergoing treatment with any anti COVID-19 medication (Group 2), will be enrolled. Paucisymptomatic patients are defined as patients with a low number of mild symptoms. All subjects must be aged &#8805;18 years, male or female, must be willing and able to give informed consent and must not have any contraindications to take hydroxychloroquine (intolerance or previous toxicity for hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, bradycardia or reduction in heart rhythm with arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, retinopathy, congestive heart failure with use of diuretics, favism or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, diabetes type 1, major comorbidities such as advanced chronic kidney disease or dialysis therapy, known history of ventricular arrhythmia, any oncologic/hematologic malignancy, severe neurological and mental illness, current use of medications with known significant drug-drug interactions, and known prolonged QT syndrome or current use of drugs with known QT prolongation). The study is monocentric and will be conducted at Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS. Subjects will be enrolled from a large epidemic region (North-Central Italy). The Public Health Departments of several Italian regions will collaborate by identifying potentially eligible subjects. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The participants will be randomized (2:1 randomization) to receive either hydroxychloroquine (Arm A) or to Observation (Arm B). Hydroxychloroquine will be administered with the following schedule: Group1: A loading dose hydroxychloroquine 400 mg twice daily on day 1, followed by a weekly dose of hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily on days 8, 15 and 22, for a total of one month of treatment. Group 2: A loading dose hydroxychloroquine 400 mg twice daily on day 1 followed by 200 mg twice daily for a total of 5-7 days. The comparator in this trial is observation given that currently neither treatment is administered to asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic subjects, nor prophylaxis is available for contacts. Hydroxychloroquine will be shipped to subjects within 24 hours of randomization. Given the extraordinary nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, only telephonic interviews will be carried out and electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePRO) completed. During treatment, each subject will be contacted every other day for the first week and weekly thereafter (Group 2) or weekly (Group 1) by a study physician to assess early onset of any COVID-19 symptom or any adverse reaction to hydroxychloroquine and to check subject compliance. Furthermore, all subjects will receive periodic ePROs which may be completed through smartphone or tablets to record drug self-administration and onset of any symptom or adverse event. All subjects will be followed up for a total of 6 months by periodic telephonic interviews and ePROs. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint/outcome measure for this trial is: for Group 1, the proportion of subjects who become symptomatic and/or swab-positive in each arm within one month of randomization; for Group 2, the proportion of subjects who become swab-negative in each arm within 14 days of randomization. RANDOMIZATION: All household members and/or contacts of each COVID-19 index case, and the COVID-19 patient himself/herself, fulfilling all inclusion criteria will be grouped into a single cluster and this cluster will be randomized (2:1) to either arm A or arm B. Information on each subject will be recorded in specific data records. Randomization lists will be stratified according to the following factors regarding COVID-19 index cases: 1. COVID-19 risk level on the basis of province of residence (high vs. low/intermediate); 2. Index case is a healthcare professional (yes vs.no) 3. Index case with COVID-19 treatment (yes vs. no) An independent statistician not otherwise involved in the trial will generate the allocation sequence, and COVID-19 response teams will be unaware of the allocation of clusters. Randomization will be performed through an interactive web-based electronic data-capturing database. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee has been established. BLINDING (MASKING): This study is open label. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): For Group 1, a sample size of about 2000 SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects such as household members and/or contacts of COVID-19 patients will take part in the study. Assuming around 1.5-2.0 asymptomatic household members and/or contacts for each COVID-19 patient, we expect to identify approximately 1000-1300 COVID-19 index cases to be randomized. An interim analysis on efficacy is planned using standard alpha-spending function. For Group 2, sufficient power for primary objective (negative swab within 14 days of randomization) will be reached given a sample size of 300 asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic COVID-19 subjects in home situations not treated for COVID-19 (25%-30% of about 1000-1300 expected index cases). Since up to date reduced evidence about COVID-19 infection epidemiology, the continuous update of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, the sample size estimation could be updated after a one third of population will be recruited and eventually modified according to a substantial protocol amendment. An interim analysis at 100 enrolled COVID-19 patients is planned. We have planned a Generalized Estimating Equation analysis, which is more efficient than a cluster level analysis, to take advantage of subject-specific covariates. The above reported sample size analysis is therefore to be considered conservative. TRIAL STATUS: The current version of the PROTECT trial protocol is 'Final version, 15 April 2020'. The study started on 9th May 2020. The first patient was enrolled on 14th May 2020. Recruitment is expected to last through September 2020.

Participants of the LEAD Study, a population-based cohort study from Vienna, Austria, were invited along with their household members (April 20th to May20th 2020). Sera were analyzed using anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay including a neutralization test as a confirmatory assay. A total of 12,419 individuals participated (5984 LEAD participants; 6435 household members), 163 (1.31%; 59 LEAD cohort members) of whom were SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive. The estimated number of COVID-19 cases projected from our findings by age and sex for Vienna was 21,504 (1.13%). Cumulative number of positively tested cases in Vienna until May 20th 2020 was 3020, hence 7.1 times (95% confidence interval 5.5-9.1) lower than projected. Relative risk (RR) of seropositivity by age was highest for children aged 6-9 years [RR compared to age group 20-49: 1.21 (CI 0.37-4.01)], lowest for &#8805; 65 years [RR 0.47 (CI 0.21-1.03)]. Half of the positive individuals developed no or mild symptoms. In a multivariate analysis, taste and smell disturbances were most strongly related to SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Infection probability within households with one confirmed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody-positive person was 31%. Although seroprevalence was very low (1.13%) for a central European capital city, due to an early governmental lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 infections were more prevalent than officially reported polymerase chain reaction-positive cases. Of note, seroprevalence was highest in young children. Half of SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive subjects had no or only mild symptoms. Taste and smell disturbances were most prominent, possibly guiding clinicians in diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Breyer, Marie-Kathrin; Breyer-Kohansal, Robab; Hartl, Sylvia; Kundi, Michael; Weseslindtner, Lukas; Stiasny, Karin; Puchhammer-Stöckl, Elisabeth; Schrott, Andrea; Födinger, Manuela; Binder, Michael; Fiedler, Markus; Wouters, Emiel F M; Burghuber, Otto C",Sci Rep,216,16

While cardiac injury has been demonstrated in critically ill COVID-19 patients, the mechanism of injury remains unclear. Here, we review our current knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential mechanisms of myocardial injury due to viral toxicities and host immune responses. RECENT FINDINGS: A number of studies have reported an epidemiological association between history of cardiac disease and worsened outcome during COVID infection. Development of new onset myocardial injury during COVID-19 also increases mortality. While limited data exist, potential mechanisms of cardiac injury include direct viral entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and toxicity in host cells, hypoxia-related myocyte injury, and immune-mediated cytokine release syndrome. Potential treatments for reducing viral infection and excessive immune responses are also discussed. COVID patients with cardiac disease history or acquire new cardiac injury are at an increased risk for in-hospital morbidity and mortality. More studies are needed to address the mechanism of cardiotoxicity and the treatments that can minimize permanent damage to the cardiovascular system.","Zhu, Han; Rhee, June-Wha; Cheng, Paul; Waliany, Sarah; Chang, Amy; Witteles, Ronald M; Maecker, Holden; Davis, Mark M; Nguyen, Patricia K; Wu, Sean M",Curr Cardiol Rep,216,1

Accordingly, we sought to perform a systematic review of the effects of remotely delivered interventions to improve exercise behaviour in sedentary adults living with and beyond cancer. METHODS: Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials comparing a remotely delivered exercise intervention to a usual care comparison in sedentary people over 18 years old with a primary cancer diagnosis. Nine electronic databases were searched from inception to November 2020. RESULTS: The review included three trials, totalling 186 participants. Two of the included trials incorporated prescriptions that meet current aerobic exercise recommendations, one of which also meets the guidelines for resistance exercise. No trials reported an intervention adherence of 75% or more for a set prescription that meets current exercise guidelines. CONCLUSION: There is little evidence suggesting that remote exercise interventions promote exercise behaviours or improve physical function in sedentary adults living with and beyond cancer. The development and evaluation of novel remote exercise interventions is needed to establish their usefulness for clinical practice. Given the social response to the COVID-19 pandemic, further research in this area is urgently needed.","Ibeggazene, Saïd; Turner, Rebecca; Rosario, Derek; Bourke, Liam",BMC Cancer,216,20

Suspicious for COVID-19, his nasopharyngeal specimen's reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) resulted positive. Chest X-ray and HRCT demonstrated severe pulmonary involvement. Immediately, he was admitted to the emergency ward, and the treatment was started according to the national COVID-19 treatment protocol. Subsequently, diagnostic measures were taken to investigate the patient's non-heterogeneous peripheral (spinal) neuromuscular manifestations. Brain CT scan and MRI were normal, but spinal MRI with gadolinium contrast showed extensive increased T2 signal involving central gray matter and dorsal columns, extended from C7 to T12 with linear enhancement in the sagittal plane, posteriorly within the mid and lower thoracic cord. The CSF specimen demonstrated pleocytosis, positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, and elevated IgG index. Clinical presentation, MRI, CSF, and laboratory findings prioritized the acute transverse myelitis (ATM) as a probable complication of COVID-19 infection over other differential diagnoses. Intravenous methylprednisolone and, subsequently, IV human immunoglobulin were added to the treatment regimen. In the end, the complete resolution of dysesthesia, urinary retention, and constipation were achieved. After continuous and extended respiratory and motor rehabilitation programs, he was discharged asymptomatic.","Shahali, Hamze; Ghasemi, Ali; Farahani, Ramin Hamidi; Nezami Asl, Amir; Hazrati, Ebrahim",J Neurovirol,216,21

This study is aimed at forecasting the needs for healthcare resources following the expansion of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the Republic of Kazakhstan, focusing on hospital beds, equipment, and the professional workforce in light of the developing epidemiological situation and the data on resources currently available. METHODS: We constructed a forecast model of the epidemiological scenario via the classic susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) approach. The World Health Organization’s COVID-19 Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool was used to evaluate the healthcare resources needed for the next 12 weeks. RESULTS: Over the forecast period, there will be 104 713.7 hospital admissions due to severe disease and 34 904.5 hospital admissions due to critical disease. This will require 47 247.7 beds for severe disease and 1929.9 beds for critical disease at the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak. There will also be high needs for all categories of healthcare workers and for both diagnostic and treatment equipment. Thus, Republic of Kazakhstan faces the need for a rapid increase in available healthcare resources and/or for finding ways to redistribute resources effectively.

Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is considered the principal component in Glycyrrhiza spp. with a wide spectrum of antiviral activity. AIM: The present study attempt to validate the medicinal use of Glycyrrhiza uralensis for hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and further to verify whether GA is an active antiviral component in the water extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radices of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. were extracted with hot water. The chemical contents of the extract were profiled with HPLC analysis. The antiviral activity of the extract and the major components was evaluated against infection of enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) on Vero cells. The cytopathic effect caused by the infection was measured with MTT assay. Infectious virion production was determined using secondary infection assays and viral protein expression by immunoblotting analysis. RESULTS: The extract at 1000 μg/ml suppressed EV71 replication by 1.0 log and CVA16 by 1.5 logs. The antiviral activity was associated with the content of GA in the extract since selective depletion of GA from the extract by acid precipitation resulted in loss of antiviral activity. In contrast, the acid precipitant retained antiviral activity. The precipitant at a concentration of 200 μg/ml inhibited EV71 and CVA16 replication by 1.7 and 2.2 logs, respectively. Furthermore, GA dose-dependently blocked viral replication of EV71 and CVA16. At 3 mM, GA reduced infectious CVA16 and EV71 production by 3.5 and 2.2 logs, respectively. At 5 mM, CVA16 production was reduced by 6.0 logs and EV71 by 4.0 logs. Both EV71 and CVA16 are members of Enterovirus genus, time-of-drug addition studies however showed that GA directly inactivated CVA16, while GA anti-EV71 effect was associated with an event(s) post virus cell entry. CONCLUSIONS: This study validated the medicinal usefulness of radices Glycyrrhiza uralensis against the etiological agents of HFMD. In addition to the identification of GA as the antiviral component of Glycyrrhiza uralensis against EV71 and CVA16 infection, this study also reveals that GA inhibits EV71 and CVA16 with distinct mechanisms.","Wang, Jingjing; Chen, Xiaoqing; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Yating; Yang, Ziying; Jin, Yu; Ge, Hui Ming; Li, Erguang; Yang, Guang",J Ethnopharmacol,216,33

Long-duration confinement studies have found effects on homeostatic biology and neurobehavioral functions, including reduced sleep durations. This study evaluated how confinement due to Covid-19 has impacted health and stress through changes in sleep. METHODS: The Anonymous Survey on Confinement during the COVID-19 Pandemic was available online to any individual ≥18 years of age through the Penn Medicine Clinical Research webpage on May 14, 2020 and the data presented are through October 24, 2020. The survey collected self-reported information on demographics, the amount and quality of sleep, as well as ratings of health and stress. To determine the impact of confinement on these domains, participants were asked to answer questions relative to pre-confinement levels. To test associations between sleep amounts and sleep quality on health and stress, generalized linear models were used and adjusted for age, sex, and race. RESULTS: N=228 participants (n=180 female [79.0%]) were on average 45.0±17.1 years of age. During confinement relative to pre-confinement, 41.7% of participants reported sleeping more, 37.3% reported sleeping the same amount, and 21.0% reported less sleep, while 14.0% reported better sleep quality, 47.4% the same, and 38.6% worse quality of sleep relative to pre-confinement. Ratings of worse health during confinement were associated with both reduced sleep amount (β=0.695; P<0.0001) and worse sleep quality (β=0.532; P=0.0002). Lower stress ratings were associated with increased sleep amount (β=0.734; P=0.034), better sleep quality (β=1.396; P=0.0002), better health ratings (β=-0.079; P=0.0045). Conversely, worse sleep quality was associated with higher stress ratings (β=-1.086; P=0.0007). CONCLUSION: The confinement resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the amount and quality of sleep and good sleep may help to reduce stress and maintain health. These findings highlight the need to further examine how long-term confinement influences human health and behavior and warrant examining what factors or life-style behaviors promote resilience to the negative effects of confinement.

Our primary endpoint was the rate or severe disease defined as hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, or death in both groups. FINDINGS: Among 258,716 persons with both doses of vaccines and 756,150 without any vaccination, we identified 271 (0.1%) vaccinated persons with breakthrough infection and 48,114 (6.4%) unvaccinated matched controls with infection between December 15, 2020 and March 30, 2021.

Determining where HCWs might have been infected is challenging based on epidemiological data alone. At Akershus University Hospital, Norway, several clusters of possible intra-hospital SARS-CoV-2 transmission were identified based on routine contact tracing. To investigate these clusters further, we added whole genome sequencing (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 virus to routine contact tracing among HCWs and between HCWs and patients. This study illustrates both the potential power and challenges with high-resolution genotyping in outbreak settings. AIM: The aim was to determine whether clusters of suspected intra-hospital SARS-CoV-2 transmission could be resolved by combining WGS of SARS-CoV-2 with contact tracing data. METHODS: Epidemiological data were collected during routine contact tracing of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs. Possible outbreaks were identified as wards with two or more infected HCWs defined as close contacts who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 less than three weeks apart. Viral RNA from naso-/oropharyngeal samples underwent nanopore sequencing according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) in direct compliance to the Artic Network protocol (https://artic.network/ncov-2019). RESULTS: Five outbreaks were suspected from contact tracing. Viral consensus sequences from 24 HCWs, two patients and seven anonymous samples were analysed. Two outbreaks were confirmed, one refuted, two remained undetermined. One new potential outbreak was discovered. CONCLUSION: Combined with epidemiological data, nanopore WGS was a useful tool for investigating intra-hospital SARS-CoV-2 transmission. WGS helped resolve questions about possible outbreaks and guide local infection prevention and control measures.","Løvestad, Alexander Hesselberg; Jørgensen, Silje Bakken; Handal, Nina; Ambur, Ole Herman; Aamot, Hege Vangstein",J Hosp Infect,216,24

METHODS: Patients were recruited from July 2014 to December 2015 and randomly assigned to one of two groups: KFEH (n = 60) and SPT (n = 59). Outcomes (joint function) were evaluated according to the Knee Society Score (KSS), visual analog scale (VAS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, and range of motion (ROM) assessment at selected time points (preoperatively; 1 week; 1, 3, and 6 months; and 1 year after surgery). RESULTS: Pain and functional improvement were observed in both groups. Non-inferiority of KFEH was evident 12 months postoperatively; however, patients in the KFEH group exhibited better ROM at 1 month (P < 0.01). Absolute WOMAC and KSS scores were slightly better in the KFEH group, although the difference was not statistically significant. There was no difference in VAS scores and complication rates between the two groups. Additionally, the home program would save patient time and decrease the economic burden associated with in-hospital SPT. CONCLUSION: Considering rehabilitation and economic efficiency as well as the COVID pandemic, a home-based enhanced knee flexion exercise program for TKA rehabilitation is recommended.

Complement was implicated as key contributor to this process, therefore we hypothesized that markers of the complement profile, indicative for the activation state of the system, may be related to the severity and mortality of COVID-19. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study samples of 102 hospitalized and 26 outpatients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed. Primary outcome was in-hospital, COVID-19 related mortality, and secondary outcome was COVID-19 severity as assessed by the WHO ordinal scale. Complement activity of alternative and classical pathways, its factors, regulators, and activation products were measured by hemolytic titration, turbidimetry, or enzyme-immunoassays. Clinical covariates and markers of inflammation were extracted from hospital records. RESULTS: Increased complement activation was characteristic for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Complement activation was significantly associated with markers of inflammation, such as interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and ferritin. Twenty-five patients died during hospital stay due to COVID-19 related illness. Patients with uncontrolled complement activation leading to consumption of C3 and decrease of complement activity were more likely to die, than those who had complement activation without consumption. Cox models identified anaphylatoxin C3a, and C3 overactivation and consumption (ratio of C3a/C3) as predictors of in-hospital mortality [HR of 3.63 (1.55–8.45, 95% CI) and 6.1 (2.1–17.8), respectively]. CONCLUSION: Increased complement activation is associated with advanced disease severity of COVID-19. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are more likely to die when the disease is accompanied by overactivation and consumption of C3. These results may provide observational evidence and further support to studies on complement inhibitory drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.","Sinkovits, György; Mező, Blanka; Réti, Marienn; Müller, Veronika; Iványi, Zsolt; Gál, János; Gopcsa, László; Reményi, Péter; Szathmáry, Beáta; Lakatos, Botond; Szlávik, János; Bobek, Ilona; Prohászka, Zita Z.; Förhécz, Zsolt; Csuka, Dorottya; Hurler, Lisa; Kajdácsi, Erika; Cervenak, László; Kiszel, Petra; Masszi, Tamás; Vályi-Nagy, István; Prohászka, Zoltán",Front Immunol,216,1

Studies have shown that patients with COVID-19 are prone to thrombotic disease resulting in increased mortality. We present a case of COVID-19 pneumonia in a warehouse worker with a giant thrombus-in-transit involving the right ventricle and tricuspid valve. We also describe the associated diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. CASE REPORT: A 54-year-old man with recent COVID-19 exposure presented with fever, cough, dyspnea, and syncope and was found to be in hypoxic respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen. The clinical course deteriorated with worsening respiratory failure and septic shock, requiring mechanical ventilation and pressor support. Further evaluation revealed a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 and an S1Q3T3 pattern on electrocardiogram. A bedside transthoracic echocardiogram was performed due to clinical deterioration and hemodynamic instability, which showed a large thrombus-in-transit through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. The patient was treated with low-molecular-weight heparin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and supportive care. A repeat echocardiogram after 1 week did not show any thrombus. The patient slowly improved over the following weeks but required tracheostomy due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. He was discharged on oral anticoagulation. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the presence of significant COVID-19-related hemostatic disturbances and the importance of associated diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.

Early authorizations were largely based on results from two clinical trials. A third study published by Wang et al. was underpowered and deemed inconclusive. Although regulators have shown an interest in interpreting the Wang et al. study, under a frequentist framework it is difficult to determine if the non-significant finding was caused by a lack of power or by the absence of an effect. Bayesian hypothesis testing does allow for quantification of evidence in favor of the absence of an effect. FINDINGS: Results of our Bayesian reanalysis of the three trials show ambiguous evidence for the primary outcome of clinical improvement and moderate evidence against the secondary outcome of decreased mortality rate. Additional analyses of three studies published after initial marketing approval support these findings. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that regulatory bodies take all available evidence into account for endorsement decisions. A Bayesian approach can be beneficial, in particular in case of statistically non-significant results. This is especially pressing when limited clinical efficacy data is available.","Hoek, Joyce M.; Field, Sarahanne M.; de Vries, Ymkje Anna; Linde, Maximilian; Pittelkow, Merle-Marie; Muradchanian, Jasmine; van Ravenzwaaij, Don",PLoS One,216,1

Despite being essential to slow down the COVID-19 pandemic, these containment measures are associated with an economic burden. In this work, we propose a network approach to model the implementation of a partial lockdown, breaking the society into disconnected components, or partitions. Our model is composed by two main ingredients: a multiplex network representing human contacts within different contexts, formed by a Household layer, a Work layer, and a Social layer including generic social interactions, and a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered process that mimics the epidemic spreading. We compare different partition strategies, with a twofold aim: reducing the epidemic outbreak and minimizing the economic cost associated to the partial lockdown. We also show that the inclusion of unconstrained social interactions dramatically increases the epidemic spreading, while different kinds of restrictions on social interactions help in keeping the benefices of the network partition.

The prevalence of bleeding in these patients remains unclear. The aim of this meta-analysis is to estimate the rate of gastrointestinal bleeding in COVID-19 patients and its association with mortality. MEDLINE and Embase were searched through December 20, 2020. Studies reporting COVID-19 patients with and without gastrointestinal bleeding were included. Estimated prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was pooled; heterogeneity was expressed as I(2). Metaregression analysis was performed to assess the impact of confounding covariates. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. A total of 91887 COVID-19 patients were considered, of whom 534 reported gastrointestinal bleeding (0.6%) [409 (76.6%) upper and 121 (22.7%) lower gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB and LGIB, resp.)]. The overall pooled gastrointestinal bleeding rate was 5% [95% CI 2–8], with high heterogeneity (I(2) 99.2%); “small study effect” was observed using the Egger test (p=0.049). After removing two outlier studies, the pooled bleeding rate was 2% [95% CI 0–4], with high heterogeneity (I(2) 99.2%), and no “small study effect” (p=0.257). The pooled UGIB rate was 1% (95% CI 0–3, I(2) 98.6%, p=0.214), whereas the pooled LGIB rate was 1% (95% CI 0–2, I(2) 64.7%, p=0.919). Metaregression analysis showed that overall estimates on gastrointestinal bleeding were affected by studies reporting different sources of bleeding. No significant association between gastrointestinal bleeding and mortality was found. In this meta-analysis of published studies, individuals with COVID-19 were found to be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, especially upper gastrointestinal bleeding.","Marasco, Giovanni; Maida, Marcello; Morreale, Gaetano Cristian; Licata, Massimo; Renzulli, Matteo; Cremon, Cesare; Stanghellini, Vincenzo; Barbara, Giovanni",Can J Gastroenterol Hepatol,216,33

One of the current limitations to successful trials is the relative transduction efficiency to produce a therapeutic effect. While intratumoral injections are the mainstay of many treatment regimens to date, this approach is hindered by hydrostatic pressures within the tumor and is not always applicable to all tumor subtypes. Vascular-targeting strategies introduce an alternative method to deliver vectors with higher local concentrations and minimization of systemic toxicity. Moreover, therapeutic targeting of angiogenic vasculature often leads to enhanced bystander effects, improving efficacy. While identification of functional and systemically accessible molecular targets is challenging, approaches, such as in vivo phage display and phage-based viral delivery vectors, provide a platform upon which vascular targeting of vectors may become a viable and translational approach.","Driessen, Wouter H.P.; Ozawa, Michael G.; Arap, Wadih; Pasqualini, Renata",Advances in Genetics,216,1

Besides effectiveness or impact, health policy implementation should be studied to understand how an intervention was delivered within complex environments. Implementation outcomes can be used to help interpret CHPE effects and impacts, help answer questions of “how” and “why” programs work, and inform transferability. We evaluated Safer Opioid Prescribing (SOP), a national CHPE program, using implementation outcomes of reach, dose, fidelity, and participant responsiveness. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective quantitative implementation evaluation of the 2014–2017 cohorts of SOP. To measure reach and dose, we examined participation and completion data. We used Ontario physician demographic data, including regulatory status with respect to controlled substances, to examine relevant trends. To measure fidelity and participant responsiveness, we analyzed participant-provided evaluations of bias, active learning, and relevance to practice. We used descriptive statistics and measures of association for both continuous and categorical variables. We used logistic regression to determine predictors of workshop participation and analysis of covariance to examine variation in satisfaction across different-sized sessions. RESULTS: Reach: In total, there were 472 unique participants, 84.0% of whom were family physicians. Among Ontario physician participants, 90.0% were family physicians with characteristics representative of province-wide demographics. Dose: Webinar completion rate was 86.2% with no differences in completion based on rurality, gender, or controlled substance prescribing status with medical regulatory authorities. Fidelity and participant responsiveness: Nearly all participants rated the three webinars and workshop as balanced, and each element of SOP was also rated as highly relevant to clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: This evaluation demonstrates that Safer Opioid Prescribing was implemented as intended. Over a short period and without any external funding, the program reached more than 1% of the Ontario physician workforce. This suggests that the program may be a good model for using virtual CHPE to reach a critical mass of prescribers. This study represents a methodological advance of adapting evaluation methods from health policy and complex interventions for continuing health professions education. Future studies will assess effectiveness and impact on opioid prescribing and utilization within evaluation models of complex interventions.

Objective To study the seroprevalence rates of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among healthy blood donors in Jordan, at various points of time as the pandemic evolves in the community. Methods A total of 1374 blood donor were tested for the SARS-CoV-2 total immunoglobulin antibodies in 3 groups. The first and second group: 746 and 348 individuals were tested in June and September-2020 respectively. The 3rd group of 292 were tested in February-2021. We utilized a qualitative assay (specificity: 99.8%, sensitivity: 100%). Results The first 2 groups (January-September, 2020) when the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases were several hundred-3000 showed a seroprevalence rate of 0% (95% CI 0.00%-0.51%). The 3rd group (early February 2021), when the number reported confirmed case has reached 100 folds that of September 2020, revealed a seroprevalence of 27.4% (95% CI 22.5%-32.9%). Conclusions a dramatic rise in seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was seen among healthy blood donors in Jordan in parallel with wide-spread intracommunity transmission of the disease.

Heart Failure (HF) patients should have particularly been concerned. During the pandemic, movement restrictions and fear of contamination could have worsened HF patients. METHODS: We conducted two dedicated anonymous questionnaire completed at the end of the first lockdown period in France about the HF patients'symptoms and the cardiologists'pratice. In parallel, data from the SNDS (Système National des Données de Santé) were collected concerning the practices of cardiologists. RESULTS: Regarding HF patients, 1156 participated and filled the questionnaire. 53% were men, aged 61± 15 yo in men and 53±12 yo in women; 13% declared feeling bad during the pandemic period. 36% declared they had more dyspnea, 14% more oedema, 45% a gain of weight and 57% were more tired. 45% of patients declared having spent more than 4 weeks without any appointment with a medical doctor. Regarding Cardiologists, they proposed to perform a remotely follow-up (teleconsultation including visio, phone call management) in 23% of cases. In parallel, data from the SNDS showed that 19% of cardiologist used teleconsultations. CONCLUSION: Through this original survey, it emerges that despite the HF patients being more symptomatic, cardiological follow-up was difficult and challenging. We suggest that during pandemic, teleconsultations could improve the efficiency and quality of care, reduce demands on patients, and reduce healthcare costs.","Berthelot, Emmanuelle; Flécher, Erwan; Roubille, François; Damy, Thibaud; Lamblin, Nicolas",Ann Cardiol Angeiol (Paris),216,17

Acute kidney injury is a risk factor for mortality. There is limited scientific literature on COVID-19 infection and allergic tubulointerstitial nephritis, its clinical course and short- and long-term prognosis. METHOD: We performed a retrospective study where medical records of 60 patients with histological diagnosis of allergic tubulointerstitial nephritis from January 2009 to November 2020. In these patients, we studied the incidence of COVID-19 infection, clinical characteristics and prognosis from March to the actual date. RESULTS: Of 60 patients with allergic tubulointerstitial nephritis, 6 (10%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. The first case, an 85-year-old woman with a history of metastatic melanoma treated with nivolumab and allergic tubulointerstitial nephritis by immunobiological agents in 2018, diagnosed with mild COVID-19 infection in April 2020 without deterioration of renal function in controls at 3 and 6 months of follow-up. The second case, a 51-year-old woman with a history of large B-cell lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation and progression to multiple myeloma of lambda light chains and allergic tubulointerstitial nephritis due to chemotherapy since 2019, admitted for acute pyelonephritis and PRES syndrome secondary to first dose of bortezomib complicated with COVID-19 nosocomial pneumonia and acute pancreatitis treated with corticosteroids and broad spectrum antibiotic therapy; she died of abdominal refractory septic shock. The third patient, a 64-year-old man without prior renal impairment, was admitted for severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute kidney injury secondary to acute tubulointerstitial nephritis of uncertain etiology that required orotracheal intubation and continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration for a week who received methylprednisolone in bolus for 3 days and continued treatment with corticosteroid therapy with complete recovery of renal function and improvement in proteinuria at 3 months of follow-up. The fourth patient, an 82-year-old woman with acute kidney injury AKIN 3 secondary to acute allergic tubulointerstitial nephritis related to ciprofloxacin complicated with severe COVID-19 nosocomial pneumonia, who died despite ventilatory support and high-dose steroids therapy and tocilizumab. The fifth patient, a 75-year-old with a history of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma treated with immunobiological agents and allergic tubulointerstitial nephritis in 2018, admitted in march 2020 for mild COVID-19 pneumonia treated with steroids and hydroxychloroquine without deterioration of respiratory and kidney function. The sixth patient, an 86-years-old man with acute kidney injury AKIN 3 due to acute allergic tubulointerstitial nephritis secondary to proton-binding inhibitors and nosocomial COVID-19 infección with improvement of kidney function with steroids therapy only. CONCLUSION: Our 6 patients with allergic tubulointerstitial nephritis and COVID-19 infection presented different spectrum of the disease. It seems that nosocomial COVID-19 infection in patients admitted with recent diagnosis of acute allergic tubulointerstitial nephritis presented a worse clinical prognosis compared with long-term diagnosed acute tubulointerstitial nephritis.

The aim was to describe the obstetric-perinatal and neonatal outcome of infected pregnant women and their newborns during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) Methods: Three bibliographical databases were searched (last search: 10 September 2020). Quality assessment was performed using the AMSTAR-2 tool. Primary outcomes included mode of delivery, preterm delivery/labor, premature rupture of membranes (PROM/pPROM) and abortions/miscarriages. Outcomes were mainly presented as ranges. A separate analysis, including only moderate and high-quality systematic reviews, was also conducted. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020214447); (3) Results: Thirty-nine reviews were analyzed. Reported rates, regarding both preterm and term gestations, varied between 52.3 and 95.8% for cesarean sections; 4.2–44.7% for vaginal deliveries; 14.3–63.8% specifically for preterm deliveries and 22.7–32.2% for preterm labor; 5.3–12.7% for PROM and 6.4–16.1% for pPROM. Maternal anxiety for potential fetal infection contributed to abortion decisions, while SARS-CoV-2-related miscarriages could not be excluded. Maternal ICU admission and mechanical ventilation rates were 3–28.5% and 1.4–12%, respectively. Maternal mortality rate was <2%, while stillbirth, neonatal ICU admission and mortality rates were <2.5%, 3.1–76.9% and <3%, respectively. Neonatal PCR positivity rates ranged between 1.6% and 10%. After accounting for quality of studies, ranges of our primary outcomes remained almost unchanged, while among our secondary outcomes, maternal ICU admission (3–10%) and mechanical ventilation rates (1.4–5.5%) were found to be relatively lower; (4) Conclusions: Increased rates of cesarean sections and preterm birth rates were found, with iatrogenic reasons potentially involved. In cases of symptomatic women with confirmed infection, high maternal and neonatal ICU admission rates should raise some concerns. The probability of vertical transmission cannot be excluded.

Anchoring bias is one of the major factors leading to diagnostic error. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the high probability of COVID-19 in febrile patients could be a major cause of anchoring bias leading to diagnostic error. In addition, certain evaluations such as auscultation are difficult to perform on a casual basis due to the increased risk of contact infection, which lead to inadequate assessment of the patients with valvular disease. Acute mitral regurgitation (MR) could be a fatal disease in the emergency department, especially if there is a diagnostic error or delay in diagnosis. It is often reported that diagnosis can be difficult even though there is no treatment other than emergent surgery. The diagnosis of acute MR has become more difficult because coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic could affect our daily practice especially in febrile patients. We report a case of a diagnostic delay of a febrile patient because of anchoring bias during the COVID-19 pandemic. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old man presented to the emergency department complaining of acute dyspnea and fever. Based on vital signs and computed tomography of the chest, acute pneumonia due to COVID-19 was suspected. Auscultation was avoided because of facility rule based on concern of contact infection. After admission to the intensive care unit, Doppler echocardiography revealed acute mitral regurgitation, and transesophageal echocardiography revealed mitral valve tendon rupture. After confirming the negative result for the polymerase chain reaction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, mitral valvuloplasty was performed on the third day after admission. The patient was discharged 14 days after admission without complications. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 pandemic, anchoring bias suspecting COVID-19 among febrile patients becomes a strong heuristic factor. A thorough history and physical examination is still important in febrile patients presenting with dyspnea to ensure the correct diagnosis of acute mitral regurgitation.

Inadequate and defective IFN type I responses against SARS-CoV-2, caused by autoantibodies in a proportion of patients, lead to severe courses. In addition, hyperactive responses of the humoral immune system have been described so far. RATIONALE In the current study we investigated a possible role of neutralizing autoantibodies against anti-inflammatory mediators. Plasma from patients with severe and critical COVID-19 was screened by ELISA for antibodies against PGRN, IL-10, IL-18BP, IL-22BP and IL-1-RA. Autoantibodies were characterized and the antigens were analyzed for immunogenic alterations. RESULTS PGRN-autoantibodies were detected with high titers in 11 of 30 (36.7%), and IL-1-RA-autoantibodies in 14 of 30 (46.7%) patients of a discovery cohort with severe to critical COVID-19. In a validation cohort of 41 patients with critical COVID-19 high-titered PGRN-Abs were detected in 12 (29.3%) and IL-1-RA-Abs in 19 of 41 patients (46.2%). PGRN-Abs and IL-1-RA-Abs belonged to IgM and several IgG subclasses. In separate cohorts with non-critical COVID-19, PGRN-Abs and IL-1-RA-Abs were detected significantly less frequently and at low titers. Neither PGRN-nor IL-1-RA-Abs were found in 40 healthy controls vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. PGRN-Abs were not cross-reactive against SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins or against IL-1-RA. Plasma levels of both free PGRN and IL-1-RA were significantly decreased in autoantibody-positive patients compared to Ab-negative and non-COVID controls. Functionally, PGRN-Abs from patients reduced PGRN-dependent inhibition of TNF-α signaling in vitro. The pSer81 hyperphosphorylated PGRN isoform was exclusively detected in patients with high-titer PGRN-Abs; likewise, a yet unidentified hyperphosphorylated IL-1-RA isoform was only found in patients with high-titer IL-1-RA-Abs. No autoantibodies against IL-10, IL-18BP or IL-22BP were found. CONCLUSION To conclude, neutralizing autoantibodies to IL-1-RA and PGRN occur in a significant proportion of patients with critical COVID-19, with a concomitant decrease in circulating PGRN and IL-1-RA, which is indicative of a misdirected, proinflammatory autoimmune response.

Although gout has been known for antiquity, many challenges still exist in gout management. It is vital to view gout as a chronic disease and not just treat the acute flare. There is a perception of gout as an acute disease requiring treatment only for acute flares. However, to combat the disease, chronic urate-lowering therapy, reducing the serum urate levels to below the saturation threshold of 6.8 mg/dL, and chronic anti-inflammatory prophylaxis, especially during urate-lowering therapy initiation, are needed. In this manuscript, we discuss some of the contentious issues in gout management. These include the timing of urate-lowering therapy initiation, which urate-lowering therapy to chose, should comorbidities influence our treatment, using genetic determinants, and patient perspectives to drive treatment and differences between gout treatment the American College of Physicians and Rheumatology guidelines for gout management: driving care.","Talaat, Mohamed; Park, Kyle; Schlesinger, Naomi",Open Access Rheumatol,216,13

Pandemics have been caused previously by viruses of this family like Middle East Respiratory Corona Virus (MERS CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (SARS CoV). Although these viruses are primarily respiratory viruses, but they have been isolated from non-respiratory samples as well. Presently, the detection rate of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA from different clinical specimens using Real Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerized Chain Reaction (qRT‐PCR) after onset of symptoms is not yet well established. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to establish the profile of detecting SARS‐CoV‐2, MERS CoV, SARS CoV from different types of clinical specimens other than the respiratory using a standard diagnostic test (qRT‐PCR). A total of 3429 non-respiratory specimens were recorded: SARS CoV (total sample—802), MERS CoV (total sample—155), SARS CoV-2 (total sample—2347). Out of all the samples studied high positive rate was seen for saliva with 96.7% (14/14; 95% CI 87.6–100.0%) for SARS CoV and 57.5% (58/250; 95% CI − 1.2 to 116.2%) for SARS CoV-2, while low detection rate in urine samples for SARS CoV-2 with 2.2% (8/318; 95% CI 0.6–3.7%) and 9.6% (12/61; 95% CI − 0.9 to 20.1%) for SARS CoV but there was relatively higher positivity in urine samples for MERS CoV with detection rate of 32.4% (2/38; 95% CI − 37.3 to 102.1%). In Stool sample positivity was 54.9% (396/779; 95% CI 41.0–68.8%), 45.2% (180/430; 95% CI 28.1–62.3%) and 34.7% (4/38; 95% CI − 29.5 to 98.9%) for SARS CoV-2, MERS CoV, and SARS CoV, respectively. In blood sample the positivity was 33.3% (7/21; 95% CI 13.2–53.5%), 23.7% (42/277; 95% CI 10.5–36.9%) and 2.5% (2/81; 95% CI 0.00–5.8%) for MERS CoV, SARS CoV-2 and SARS CoV respectively. SARS‐CoV‐2 along with previous two pandemic causing viruses from this family, were highly detected stool and saliva. A low positive rate was recorded in blood samples. Viruses were also detected in fluids along with unusual samples like semen and vaginal secretions thus highlighting unique pathogenic potential of SARS‐CoV‐2.","Mishra, Chandan; Meena, Suneeta; Meena, Jitendra Kumar; Tiwari, Suman; Mathur, Purva",Sci Rep,216,30

Wearable sensors can typically assess and quantify the wearer’s physiology and are commonly employed for human activity detection and quantified self-assessment. Wearable sensors are increasingly utilised to monitor patient health, rapidly assist with disease diagnosis, and help predict and often improve patient outcomes. Clinicians use various self-report questionnaires and well-known tests to report patient symptoms and assess their functional ability. These assessments are time consuming and costly and depend on subjective patient recall. Moreover, measurements may not accurately demonstrate the patient’s functional ability whilst at home. Wearable sensors can be used to detect and quantify specific movements in different applications. The volume of data collected by wearable sensors during long-term assessment of ambulatory movement can become immense in tuple size. This paper discusses current techniques used to track and record various human body movements, as well as techniques used to measure activity and sleep from long-term data collected by wearable technology devices.","Vijayan, Vini; Connolly, James P.; Condell, Joan; McKelvey, Nigel; Gardiner, Philip",Sensors (Basel),216,22

This study attempts to confirm these effects on the transplanted cervical cancer (U27) mouse model in vivo. METHODS: Forty eight Kunming mice were randomly divided in to six groups: normal control group (Control group), U27 tumor model group (Model group), cyclophosphamide administration group (CTX group),low-dose ASMq group (ASMq.L group), medium-dose ASMq group (ASMq.M group), and high-dose ASMq group (ASMq.H group). The five groups except normal control group transplanted with cervical cancer (U27) cells. We observed mice tumor inhibition rate and conducted the histopathological analysisUsing the western blot assay, the expression of TGF-β1 and TNF-α protein in transplanted cervical cancer U27 tumor tissue were detected. RESULTS: The tumor inhibition rates of CTX group, ASMq.L group, ASMq.M group, and ASMq.H group were 72.21, 31.27, 60.53 and 51.94% respectively, has obvious antitumor effect. ASMq significantly promote the spleen tlymphocyte proliferation of transplanted cervical cancer U27 mice. Invasive growth and diffusion rate in tumor tissue were accelerate in the transplanted cervical cancer U27 model group. Tumor tissue necrosis of tumor cells are smaller in the medium, high dosage group. Compared with the U27 model group, the expression levels of TGF-β1 protein and TNF-α protein expression exhibited statistically significant decreased in the mice tumor tissues in the CTX administration group and the ASMq administration group. CONCLUSIONS: ASMq has some antitumor effects on U27 model mice in vivo, The effects are achieved not only by improving the immune function of U27 model mice, but also by inhibiting the expression levels of TGF-β1 protein while promoting the expression levels of TNF-α protein.","Omarniyaz, Zuhragul; Yu, Yang; Yang, Tao; Shan, Lianlian; Miao, Weiwei; Reyimu, Renaguli; Upur, Halmurat; Aikemu, Ainiwaer",BMC Complement Altern Med,216,8

However, little data are available about medical students’ distress during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide details on how medical students have been affected by the pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 717 medical students participated in the web-based survey. The survey included questions about how the participants’ mental status had changed from before to after the Japanese nationwide state of emergency (SOE). RESULTS: Out of 717 medical students, 473 (66.0%) participated in the study. In total, 29.8% (141/473) of the students reported concerns about the shift toward online education, mostly because they thought online education would be ineffective compared with in-person learning. The participants’ subjective mental health status significantly worsened after the SOE was lifted (P<.001). Those who had concerns about a shift toward online education had higher odds of having generalized anxiety and being depressed (odds ratio [OR] 1.97, 95% CI 1.19-3.28) as did those who said they would request food aid (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.16-3.44) and mental health care resources (OR 3.56, 95% CI 2.07-6.15). CONCLUSIONS: Given our findings, the sudden shift to online education might have overwhelmed medical students. Thus, we recommend that educators inform learners that online learning is not inferior to in-person learning, which could attenuate potential depression and anxiety.","Nishimura, Yoshito; Ochi, Kanako; Tokumasu, Kazuki; Obika, Mikako; Hagiya, Hideharu; Kataoka, Hitomi; Otsuka, Fumio",J Med Internet Res,216,1

Because depression commonly emerges prior to adulthood, we must consider the fundamental principles of developmental neuroscience when examining how experiences of childhood adversity, including abuse and neglect, can lead to depression. Considering that both the environment and the brain are highly dynamic across the period spanning gestation through adolescence, the purpose of this review is to discuss and integrate stress-based models of depression that center developmental processes. We offer a general framework for understanding how psychosocial adversity in early life disrupts or calibrates the biobehavioral systems implicated in depression. Specifically, we propose that the sources and nature of the environmental input shaping the brain, and the mechanisms of neuroplasticity involved, change across development. We contend that the effects of adversity largely depend on the developmental stage of the organism. First, we summarize leading neurobiological models that focus on the effects of adversity on risk for mental disorders, including depression. In particular, we highlight models of allostatic load, acceleration maturation, dimensions of adversity, and sensitive or critical periods. Second, we expound on and review evidence for the formulation that distinct mechanisms of neuroplasticity are implicated depending on the timing of adverse experiences, and that inherent within certain windows of development are constraints on the sources and nature of these experiences. Finally, we consider other important facets of adverse experiences (e.g., environmental unpredictability, perceptions of one’s experiences) before discussing promising research directions for the future of the field.","Ho, Tiffany C.; King, Lucy S.",Transl Psychiatry,216,3

Increased understanding about these patterns could be informative about the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. Methods Results from PCR diagnostics for the seasonal coronaviruses, and other respiratory viruses, were obtained for 55,190 clinical samples analyzed at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, between 14 September 2009 and 2 April 2020. Results Seasonal coronaviruses were detected in 2,130 samples (3.9%). OC43 was most commonly detected (28.4% of detections), followed by NL63 (24.0%), HKU1 (17.6%), and 229E (15.3%). The overall fraction of positive samples was relatively similar between seasons. In contrast, at species level there was distinct pattern of biennial alternating peak seasons for the Alphacoronaviruses, 229E and NL63, and the Betacoronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1, respectively. The Betacoronaviruses peaked earlier in the winter season (Dec-Jan) than the Alphacoronaviruses (Feb-Mar). Coronaviruses were detected across all ages, but diagnostics were more frequently requested for paediatric patients than adults and the elderly. The species showed different age distributions, with OC43 and 229E positivity being relatively constant across age strata, while the incidence of NL63 and HKU1 decreased with age. Conclusions Both the Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses showed alternating biennial winter incidence peaks, which suggests some type of immune mediated interaction. Symptomatic reinfections in adults and the elderly appear relatively common. Both findings may be of relevance for the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.","Dyrdak, R.; Hodcroft, E.

Humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 among military personnel serve as biomarkers of infection and provide a basis for disease surveillance and recognition of work-related risk factors. METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to measure SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen-specific IgG in serum obtained from N = 988 US National Guard soldiers between April-June 2020. Occupational information, e.g. military operating specialty (MOS) codes, and demographic data were obtained via questionnaire. Plaque assays with live SARS-CoV-2 were used to assess serum neutralizing capacity for limited subjects (N = 12). RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity rate among the study population was 10.3% and significantly associated with occupation and demographics. Odds ratios were highest for those working in MOS 2T-Transportation (3.6; 95% CI 0.7–18) and 92F-Fuel specialist/ground and aircraft (6.8; 95% CI 1.5–30), as well as black race (2.2; 95% CI 1.2–4.1), household size ≥6 (2.5; 95% CI 1.3–4.6) and known COVID-19 exposure (2.0; 95% CI 1.2–3.3).

SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG(+) serum exhibited low to moderate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing capacity with IC(50s) ranging from 1:15 to 1:280. In limited follow-up testing SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG levels remained elevated up to 7 months. CONCLUSIONS: The data highlight increased SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among National Guard vs. the local civilian population in association with transportation-related occupations and specific demographics.","Zell, Joseph; Wisnewski, Adam V.; Liu, Jian; Klein, Jon; Lucas, Carolina; Slade, Martin; Iwasaki, Akiko; Redlich, Carrie A.",PLoS One,216,5

Stress, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and depression potentiated nurses’ vulnerability to poor eating habits. Aims and Objectives: The purpose of this study was to explore the differences between nurses’ characteristics with COVID-19 facility designation, and sleep quality, depression, anxiety, stress, eating habits, social bonds, and quality of life. Design: A cross-sectional, comparative study. Methods: An online survey was sent using the corporation’s email to nurses working in three hospitals in Qatar from September to December 2020. One of them is a designated COVID-19 facility. The sleep quality, depression, eating habits, social bonds, and quality of life were measured using The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21), Emotional Eater Questionnaire (EEQ), Oslo Social Support Scale (OSSS-3), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF), respectively. Results: A total of 200 nurses participated in the study (RR: 13.3%). No statistically significant association was found between designated facility (COVID-19 vs. not COVID-19) or nurses’ characteristics and ISI categories (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.54, 2.44). Nurses working in COVID-19 facilities had increased odds of having higher EEQ categories by 2.62 times (95% CI 1.18, 5.83). Similarly, no statistically significant associations were found between any of the nurses’ characteristics and OSSS-3 categories. On the other hand, no statistically significant associations were found between any of the nurses’ characteristics and QOL domains except for the gender and social relationships’ domain. Conclusion: Overall, the quality of life of nurses in Qatar is on a positive level whether they are assigned to a COVID-19 facility or not. Although no significant difference was found with regard to the sleep quality, stress, anxiety, depression, and eating habits between nurses in a COVID-19 facility and in a non-COVID-19 facility, special interventions to diminish stressors need to be implemented and maintained.","Nashwan, Abdulqadir J.; Villar, Ralph C.; Al-Qudimat, Ahmad R.; Kader, Nisha; Alabdulla, Majid; Abujaber, Ahmad A.; Al-Jabry, Mahmood M.; Harkous, Michel; Philip, Anite; Ali, Raed; Chandra, Prem; Yassin, Mohamed A.; Shraim, Mujahed; Singh, Kalpana",J Pers Med,216,1

This study was designed to investigate the effect of postoperative high-load long-duration inspiratory muscle training on pulmonary function, inspiratory muscle strength, and functional capacity after mitral valve replacement surgeries. DESIGN: Prospective randomized controlled trial. METHODS: A total of one hundred patients (mean age 38.3±3.29years) underwent mitral valve replacement surgery were randomized into experimental (n = 50) and control (n = 50) groups. The control group received conventional physiotherapy care, while experimental group received conventional care in addition to inspiratory muscle training, with 40% of the baseline maximal inspiratory pressure targeting a load of 80% by the end of the 8 weeks intervention protocol. Inspiratory muscle training started on the patient’s first day in the inpatient ward. Lung functions, inspiratory muscle strength, and functional capacity were evaluated using a computer-based spirometry system, maximal inspiratory pressure measurement and 6MWT respectively at 5 time points and a follow-up assessment was performed 6 months after surgery. Repeated measure ANOVA and post-hoc analyses were used (p <0.05). RESULTS: Group-time interactions were detected for all the studied variables (p<0.001). Between-group analysis revealed statistically significant postoperative improvements in all studied variables in the experimental group compared to the control group (p <0.001) with large effect size of η(2) ˃0.14. Within-group analysis indicated substantial improvements in lung function, inspiratory pressure and functional capacity in the experimental group (p <0.05) over time, and these improvements were maintained at follow-up. CONCLUSION: High intensity, long-duration postoperative inspiratory muscle training is highly effective in improving lung function, inspiratory muscle strength, and functional capacity after mitral valve replacement surgeries.","Hegazy, Fatma A.; Mohamed Kamel, Sara M.; Abdelhamid, Ahmed S.; Aboelnasr, Emad A.; Elshazly, Mahmoud; Hassan, Ali M.",PLoS One,216,20

We aimed to assess the usefulness of nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for respiratory pathogens, in combination with standard bacteriological investigations, in febrile ACS adult patients presenting with major SCD. METHODS: We performed a prospective, monocentric, observational study of 61 SCD adults presenting with febrile ACS from February 2015 to April 2016. Systematic blood, urine, and respiratory specimens were collected, before antibiotic initiation, for culture, urinary antigen tests, serology, and NAAT for respiratory pathogens. RESULTS: A pathogen was detected in 12 febrile ACS (19.7%): four viruses (6.6%) (Rhinovirus; Influenza A/B), seven bacteria (11.4%) (S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, M. pneumoniae), one mixed infection (1.6%) (S. aureus and Influenza B). NAAT only detected L. pneumophila in one case (serogroup 2). Apart from a significantly shorter antibiotic therapy duration (6.1 vs. 7.8 days, P = 0.045), no difference was observed between undocumented and microbiologically-documented febrile ACS. CONCLUSION: Using NAAT for the detection of respiratory pathogens in adults presenting with SCD slightly improved the microbiological diagnostic of febrile ACS, although respiratory infections are not the main etiological factor.","Raffetin, A.; Melica, G.; Audureau, E.; Habibi, A.; Decousser, J.W.; Fourati, S.; Razazi, K.; Lepeule, R.; Guillaud, C.; Khellaf, M.; Bartolucci, P.; Gallien, S.",Med Mal Infect,216,33

Design We examined the reliability and internal validity of the ELCSA scale in three repeated waves of a cross-sectional surveys with Rasch models. We estimated the monthly prevalence of food insecurity in the general population and in households with and without children, and compared them with a national 2018 survey. We tested concurrent validity by testing associations of HFI with socioeconomic status and anxiety. Setting ENCOVID-19 is a monthly telephone cross-sectional survey collecting information on the well-being of Mexican households during the pandemic lockdown. Surveys used probabilistic samples and we used data from April (n=833), May (n=850), and June 2020 (n=1,674). Participants Mexicans 18 years or older who had a mobile telephone. Results ELCSA had adequate model fit and HFI was associated, within each wave, with more poverty and anxiety. The COVID-19 lockdown was associated with an important reduction in food security; decreasing stepwise from 38.9% in 2018 to 24.9% in June 2020 in households with children. Conclusions Telephone surveys are a feasible strategy to monitor food insecurity with ELCSA.","Gaitan-Rossi, P.; Vilar-Compte, M.; Teruel, G.; Perez-Escamilla, R.",,216,0

Slaughterhouse biowastes are a significant volume of biohazards that poses a high risk of contamination to the environment, an outbreak of diseases, and insecure food safety. This work comprehensively reviewed existing biowaste disposal practices and revealed the limitations of technological advancements to eradicate the threat of possible harmful infectious agents from these wastes. Policies, including strict supervision and uniform minimum hygienic regulations at all raw food processing factories, should therefore be tightened to ensure the protection of the food supply.

Studies of COVID-19 prevalence were collected by conducting an online search of published articles, preprints, and government reports that were publicly disseminated prior to 18 September 2020. The systematic review encompassed 113 studies, of which 27 studies (covering 34 geographical locations) satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Age-specific IFRs were computed using the prevalence data in conjunction with reported fatalities 4 weeks after the midpoint date of the study, reflecting typical lags in fatalities and reporting. Meta-regression procedures in Stata were used to analyze the infection fatality rate (IFR) by age. Our analysis finds a exponential relationship between age and IFR for COVID-19. The estimated age-specific IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85. Moreover, our results indicate that about 90% of the variation in population IFR across geographical locations reflects differences in the age composition of the population and the extent to which relatively vulnerable age groups were exposed to the virus. These results indicate that COVID-19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. Moreover, the overall IFR for COVID-19 should not be viewed as a fixed parameter but as intrinsically linked to the age-specific pattern of infections. Consequently, public health measures to mitigate infections in older adults could substantially decrease total deaths.

To address this disconnect, a multiparental mouse population has been developed to specifically dissect the multigenetic regulation of complex disease traits.

Coronavirus has become an issue of transnational concern. The importance of the media in the coverage of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Nigeria and its implications among Nigerian populace cannot be overestimated. This study evaluates how Nigerian media depict the coronavirus pandemic and how the depictions shape people's perception and response to the pandemic. Methods: The study employed a quantitative design (newspaper content analysis and questionnaire). The content analysis examines the nature of media coverage of coronavirus in Nigeria and China using four major national newspapers (The Sun, The Vanguard, The Guardian and The Punch). The period of study ranged from January 2020 to March 2020. A total of 1070newspaper items on coronavirus outbreak were identified across the four newspapers and content-analysed. Results: The finding shows that the coverage of the pandemic was dominated by straight news reports accounting for 763 or (71.3%) of all analysed items. This was followed by opinions 169(15.8%), features 120 (11.2%) and editorials 18 (1.7%) respectively. The Punch 309 (28.9%)reported the outbreak more frequently than The Sun 266 (24.9%), The Guardian 258 (24.1%), and Vanguard 237 (22.1%). Finding further suggests that the framing pattern adopted by the newspapers helped Nigerians to take precautionary measures. Conclusion: Continuous reportage of COVID-19 has proved effective in creating awareness about safety and preventive measures thereby helping to 'flatten the curve' and contain the spread of the virus.

Whether this population is induced in patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unknown. Recent reports have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients experience a rapid decay in their antigen-specific serum antibodies, raising concerns that humoral immunity against this virus may be short-lived6–8. Here we show that in patients who experienced mild infections (n=73), serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibodies indeed decline rapidly in the first 3 to 4 months after infection. However, this is followed by a more stable phase between 4- and 8-months after infection with a slower serum anti-S antibody decay rate. The level of serum antibodies correlated with the frequency of S-specific long-lived BMPCs obtained from 18 SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients 7 to 8 months after infection. S-specific BMPCs were not detected in aspirates from 11 healthy subjects with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Comparable frequencies of BMPCs specific to contemporary influenza virus antigens or tetanus and diphtheria vaccine antigens were present in aspirates in both groups. Circulating memory B cells (MBCs) directed against the S protein were detected in the SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients but not in uninfected controls, whereas both groups had MBCs against influenza virus hemagglutinin.

Here we compare characteristics in children with elevated ALT (E‐ALT) in two distinct manifestations of the infection, multisystem inflammatory syndrome‐children (MIS‐C) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients ≤21 years of age with positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR. E‐ALT was defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 40 U/L. Bivariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression were obtained to describe differences in children with and without E‐ALT in COVID‐19 and MIS‐C. RESULTS: E‐ALT was detected in 36% of the 291 patients; 31% with COVID‐19, and 51% with MIS‐C. E‐ALT in COVID‐19 was associated with obesity (P < .001), immunocompromised status (P = .04), and chronic liver disease (P = .01). In the regression models, E‐ALT in COVID‐19 was associated with higher c‐reactive protein (OR 1.08, P = .01) after adjusting for common independent predictors. Children with E‐ALT and MIS‐C were more often boys (P = .001), Hispanic (P = .04), or Black (P < .001). In MIS‐C, male gender (OR 5.3, P = .02) and Black race (OR 4.4, P = .04) were associated with increased odds of E‐ALT. Children with E‐ALT in both cohorts had significantly higher multiorgan dysfunction, longer hospitalization, and ICU stay. Children with MIS‐C had 2.3‐fold increased risk of E‐ALT compared to COVID‐19. No association was found between E‐ALT and mortality. CONCLUSION: E‐ALT with SARS‐CoV‐2 presents as elevated transaminases without hepatic synthetic dysfunction. Patients with either manifestation of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and E‐ALT experienced more severe disease.","Perez, Adriana; Cantor, Amanda; Rudolph, Bryan; Miller, Jonathan; Kogan‐Liberman, Debora; Gao, Qi; Da Silva, Bernardo; Margolis, Kara G.; Ovchinsky, Nadia; Martinez, Mercedes",Liver Int,216,1

Unlike body fluids, NPS samples are undermined by high variability in the amount of cells that get suspended into the VTM. Hence, the cell density used for RNA extraction becomes an important analytical variable that contributes to the overall sensitivity of the RT-PCR. In this study, we compared the sensitivity of SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR in 50 NPS samples collected from in-patients of the COVID wards using the concentration and direct methods. The concentration method detected the viral RNA in all 50 samples, while the direct method was positive in only 41 (82%) samples (p=0.003). Additionally, the Ct values were lower in the direct method compared to concentration method among the 41 positive samples (p=0.03 for N gene and p=0.04 for RdRp gene). The mean CV% was also greater than or equal to 10%.

On March 12, 2020, Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC) identified the first case of COVID-19 in the state. Because of resource constraints, including staffing, Maine CDC could not consistently monitor contacts, and automated technological solutions for monitoring contacts were explored. On May 14, 2020, Maine CDC began enrolling contacts of patients with reported COVID-19 into Sara Alert (MITRE Corporation, 2020),* an automated, web-based, symptom monitoring tool. After initial communication with Maine CDC staff members, enrolled contacts automatically received daily symptom questionnaires via their choice of e-mailed weblink, text message, texted weblink, or telephone call until completion of their quarantine. Epidemiologic investigations were conducted for enrollees who reported symptoms or received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result.

In Maine, symptom monitoring was not feasible without the use of an automated symptom monitoring tool. Using a tool that permitted enrollees to specify a method of symptom monitoring was well received, because the majority of persons monitored (96.4%) agreed to report using this system.","Krueger, Anna; Gunn, Jayleen K.

Recently, we reported that Notch-1 signaling plays a key role in macrophage polarization and response during infection. We employed Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) infection in Crohn’s disease (CD) as a model to demonstrate the role of Notch-1/IL-6 signaling on MCL-1 based apoptosis and intracellular MAP infection and persistence. This study was designed to investigate the impact of polymorphisms in miR146a on the immune response and infection in our MAP-CD model. METHODS: We determined the incidence of miR-146a rs2910164 G > C in 42 blood samples from clinical CD patients and controls. We also measured the effect of rs2910164 on expression of Notch-1 and IL-6, and plasma IL-6 protein levels in our study group. Finally, we analyzed the blood samples for MAP DNA and studied any correlation with miR-146a polymorphism. Samples were analyzed for statistical significance using unpaired tow-tailed t-test, unpaired two-tailed z-score and odds ratio. P < 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: MiR-146a rs2910164 GC was detected at a higher incidence in CD (52.6%) compared to healthy controls (21.7%) rs2910164 GC Heterozygous polymorphism upregulated Notch-1 and IL-6, by 0.9 and 1.7-fold, respectively. As expected, MAP infection was detected more in CD samples (63%) compared to healthy controls (9%). Surprisingly, MAP infection was detected at a higher rate in samples with rs2910164 GC (67%) compared to samples with normal genotype (33%). CONCLUSIONS: The data clearly associates miR-146a rs2910164 GC with an overactive immune response and increases the risk to acquire infection. The study is even more relevant now in our efforts to understand susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of COVID-19. This study suggests that genetic variations among COVID-19 patients may predict who is at a higher risk of acquiring infection, developing exacerbating symptoms, and possibly death.

Specifically, simple medical equipment such as medical gloves, aprons, goggles, surgery masks, and medical face shields have become highly in demand in the health-care sector in the face of this rapidly developing pandemic. This difficult period strengthens the social solidarity to an extent parallel to the escalation of this pandemic. Education and government institutions, commercial and noncommercial organizations and individual homemakers have produced specific medical equipment by means of additive manufacturing (AM) technology, which is the fastest way to create a product, providing their support for urgent demands within the health-care services. Medical face shields have become a popular item to produce, and many design variations and prototypes have been forthcoming. Although AM technology can be used to produce several types of noncommercial equipment, this rapid manufacturing approach is limited by its longer production time as compared to conventional serial/mass production and the high demand. However, most of the individual designer/maker-based face shields are designed with little appreciation of clinical needs and nonergonomic. They also lack of professional product design and are not designed according to AM (Design for AM [DfAM]) principles. Consequently, the production time of up to 4 – 5 h for some products of these designs is needed. Therefore, a lighter, more ergonomic, single frame medical face shield without extra components to assemble would be useful, especially for individual designers/makers and noncommercial producers to increase productivity in a shorter timeframe. In this study, a medical face shield that is competitively lighter, relatively more ergonomic, easy to use, and can be assembled without extra components (such as elastic bands, softening materials, and clips) was designed. The face shield was produced by AM with a relatively shorter production time. Subsequently, finite element analysis-based structural design verification was performed, and a three-dimensional (3D) prototype was produced by an original equipment manufacturer 3D printer (Fused Deposition Modeling). This study demonstrated that an original face shield design with <10 g material usage per single frame was produced in under 45 min of fabrication time.

In this research, a multi-period location-inventory-routing (LIR) problem of perishable products is investigated under the disruption of routes in some periods. To make a resilient supply chain, two types of pricing namely dynamic pricing and disruptive pricing are applied to manage demands along with location, inventory, and routing decisions. In this regard, an integrated LIR model is developed considering disruption in routes, price-sensitive demand, and a product with a certain life-time. In this model, the price of retailers is a descending function of the time and product lifetime. The proposed model is devised as a mixed-integer non-linear programming model that maximizes the total profit of the supply chain. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, the research has developed an efficient genetic algorithm to solve large-sized problems. Computational experiments conducted indicating that the projected GA has an average gap of less than 2.66% from the optimal solution within a reasonable time. The performance of the integrated model, the efficiency of the proposed resilient strategy, and the impact of shelf-life are investigated in a case study. Results revealed that the integrated model for dynamic pricing and LIR decisions enjoys 79.33% improvement in the total expected profit for the supply chain under disruption compared to static pricing. As expected, by increasing the product's shelf-life, the profit of the supply chain increases in all pricing policies. It should be noted that applying the dynamic pricing policy, compared to the product's lifetime, enjoys a greater impact on supply chain profit under disruption. Moreover, there is a necessity to choose an appropriate pricing policy for markets with a different value of price elasticity.","Yavari, Mohammad; Enjavi, Hossein; Geraeli, Mohaddese",,216,17

For the first time the assessment was conducted using an improved panel regression model by taking into account of the detailed opening schedules of various HSR services during the period 2001–2014. The research findings reveal that the deployed HSR services have a significant substitutional effect on domestic air transportation in China, but the effect varies across different HSR routes, travel distance and city type. Specifically, the research found a decrease in domestic passengers of 28.2%, in flights of 24.6% and in seat capacity of 27.9% after the introduction of HSR services. The impacts are found much stronger among those air routes that connect major hub within a distance range of 500 to 800 km. The uneven nature of the impact can be seen in the different experiences of selected cities. For example, air travel declined approximately 45% after commencement of the Wuhan-Guangzhou HSR, whereas it fell by 34% after the opening of the Beijing-Shanghai HSR.","Chen, Zhenhua",J Transp Geogr,216,24

Though these two viral spikes were both expressed, each associated independently with Gag and gave rise to two distinct virion populations, each with a spike of a single type. Confocal imaging demonstrated that HIV Env(89.6) and Ebola GP localized to distinct lipid raft microdomains within the same cell, where each associated with distinct Gag particles. Similar Env localization was observed in HIV-infected T cells, where ~14 percent of Env was associated with Gag during productive infection.

This study aimed to compare the levels of depressive symptoms among frontline and non-frontline healthcare providers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted in two government hospitals managing COVID-19-related cases in Kelantan, Malaysia from May to July 2020 to identify and compared depressive symptoms levels of frontline and non-frontline healthcare providers. Convenient sampling was applied in the selection of eligible participants and those diagnosed as having any psychiatric illnesses were excluded. The self-administered questionnaires for the Malay versions of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to measure depressive symptoms score and the Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey to measure social support score as an important confounder. A descriptive analysis, independent t-test and ANCOVA were performed using SPSS version 26. RESULTS: A total of 306 respondents from healthcare providers were recruited which 160 were frontline healthcare providers and 146 were non-frontline healthcare providers. The level of depressive symptoms (HADS score >8) was 27.5% for the frontline healthcare providers and 37.7% for the non-frontline healthcare providers. The mean depressive symptoms score for the non-frontline healthcare providers was 0.75 points higher than that of the frontline healthcare providers after adjusting for gender, duration of employment and social support.

METHODS: Electron microscopy was used to evaluate the pulmonary pathologies of postmortem lung sections from three patients who died from infection with SARS-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new member of the Coronaviridae family. RESULTS: Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was predominant in all three patients. The early exudative stage was characterized principally by edema and extravasation of red blood cells into the alveolar space with injury to the alveolar epithelial cells; this was followed by detachment, apoptosis, and necrosis of type I and II pneumocytes. The capillaries exhibited congestion, exposure of the basement membrane from denuded endothelial cells, platelet adhesion, fibrin thrombi, and rupture of the capillary walls. The proliferative stage was characterized by pronounced proliferation of type II alveolar pneumocytes and multinucleated giant cells. The cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 was observed both in degenerated type II pneumocytes and freely circulating in the alveoli, with components from virions, macrophages, lymphocytes, and cellular debris. CONCLUSIONS: Viral particles consistent with the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 were observed mainly in degenerated pneumocytes, in the endothelium, or freely circulating in the alveoli.

High lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations are a strong risk factor for IHD and possibly for thromboembolic events. We therefore evaluated whether SARS‐CoV‐2 infections modify the risk of high Lp(a) concentrations for IHD or thromboembolic events during the first 8.5 months follow‐up of the pandemic. METHOD: Cohort study using data from the UK Biobank during the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic. Baseline Lp(a) was compared between SARS‐CoV‐2 positive patients and the population controls. UK Biobank received ethical approval from the North West Multi‐Centre Research Ethics Committee (REC reference: 11/NW/0382). All participants gave written informed consent before enrolment in the study, which was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. RESULTS: SARS‐CoV‐2 positive patients had Lp(a) concentrations similar to the population controls. The risk for IHD increased with higher Lp(a) concentrations in both, the population controls (n = 435,104) and SARS‐CoV‐2 positive patients (n = 6,937). The causality of the findings was supported by a genetic risk score for Lp(a). A SARS‐CoV‐2 infection modified the association with a steeper increase in risk for infected patients (interaction P‐value = 0.03). Although SARS‐CoV‐2 positive patients had a 5‐times higher frequency of thromboembolic events compared to the population controls (1.53% vs. 0.31%), the risk was not influenced by Lp(a). CONCLUSIONS: SARS‐CoV‐2 infections enforce the association between high Lp(a) and IHD but the risk for thromboembolic events is not influenced by Lp(a). This article is protected by copyright.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated neutrophil subsets and functions in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of COVID-19 patients on the basis of patients’ clinical characteristics. METHODS: We used a multiparametric cytometry profiling based to mature and immature neutrophil markers in 146 critical or severe COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The Discovery study (38 patients, first pandemic wave) showed that 80% of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients develop strong myelemia with CD10(−)CD64(+) immature neutrophils (ImNs). Cellular profiling revealed three distinct neutrophil subsets expressing either the lectin‐like oxidized low‐density lipoprotein receptor‐1 (LOX‐1), the interleukin-3 receptor alpha (CD123), or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) overrepresented in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients. The proportion of LOX-1- or CD123-expressing ImNs is positively correlated with clinical severity, cytokine storm (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNFα), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and thrombosis. BALs of patients with ARDS were highly enriched in LOX-1-expressing ImN subsets and in antimicrobial neutrophil factors. A validation study (118 patients, second pandemic wave) confirmed and strengthened the association of the proportion of ImN subsets with disease severity, invasive ventilation, and death. Only high proportions of LOX-1-expressing ImNs remained strongly associated with a high risk of severe thrombosis independently of the plasma antimicrobial neutrophil factors, suggesting an independent association of ImN markers with their functions. CONCLUSION: LOX-1-expressing ImNs may help identifying COVID-19 patients at high risk of severity and thrombosis complications.","Combadière, Behazine; Adam, Lucille; Guillou, Noëlline; Quentric, Paul; Rosenbaum, Pierre; Dorgham, Karim; Bonduelle, Olivia; Parizot, Christophe; Sauce, Delphine; Mayaux, Julien; Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Boissonnas, Alexandre; Amoura, Zahir; Pourcher, Valérie; Miyara, Makoto; Gorochov, Guy; Guihot, Amélie; Combadière, Christophe",Front Immunol,216,29

Maladaptive hyperinflammation and excessive cytokine release underlie the disease severity, with antiinflammatory and cytokine inhibiting agents expected to exert therapeutic effects. A major present challenge is identification of appropriate phase of the illness for a given intervention to yield optimum outcomes. Considering its established disease biomarker and drug discovery potential, a compendious analysis of existing transcriptomic data is presented here toward addressing this gap. The analysis is based on COVID-19 data related to intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU admissions, discharged and deceased patients, ventilation and non-ventilation phases, and high oxygen supplementation. It integrates transcriptomic data related to the effects of, in various cellular treatment models, the COVID-19 randomized clinical trial (RCT) successful drug dexamethasone, and the failed drug, with a potential to harm, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine. Similarly, effects of various COVID-19 candidate drugs/anticytokines as well as proinflammatory cytokines implicated in the illness are also examined. The underlying assumption was that compared to COVID-19, an effective drug/anticytokine and a disease aggravating agent would affect gene regulation in opposite and same direction, in that order. Remarkably, the assumption was supported with respect to both the RCT drugs. With this control validation, etanercept, followed by tofacitinib and adalimumab, showed transcriptomic effects predictive of benefits in both ventilation and non-ventilation ICU stages as well as in non-ICU phase. On the other hand, canakinumab showed potential for effectiveness in high oxygen supplementation phase.

The main difference between our publication and that of Zhang et al. (1), was that we assessed all rare predicted loss-of-function variants (pLOFs) meeting the same criteria in cases and controls, which is a well-established paradigm in the field (2). On the other hand, Zhang et al. included specific variants which were experimentally confirmed only in cases, but not controls, precluding a valid case-control comparison.We matched patients as closely as possible to the previous study, and the inclusion of more severe cases (WHO grades 7-10) should only strengthen the signal against population controls. The use of population controls is standard in such settings and has minimal impact on power, because only a small proportion of individuals exposed to SARS-Cov-2 develop severe disease (3). Additionally, for the pLOF model we report adequate power even for an odds ratio of 5.5, which is considerably lower than the one reported by Zhang et al. We tested the same dominant model as Zhang et al., even though LOF variants in these genes have only been reported to cause disease under recessive inheritance (4).We have serious concerns about confounding by ancestry in the analysis by Zhang et al. in which the pLOF carriers were mostly European, but functionally validated missense variants were found in various nationalities from Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. Because the rates of pLOFs vary considerably across populations, adjusting for only 3 principal components of ancestry in rare-variant association tests of multi-ethnic cohorts does not provide adequate control for population structure.While we noted that age differences may contribute to the discrepancies between the two studies, Zhang et al. do not discuss the role of age in the interpretation of their results stating: ""Inborn errors of TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I IFN immunity at eight loci were found in as many as 23 patients (3.5%) of various ages (17 to 77 years) and ancestries (various nationalities from Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East) and in patients of both sexes."" We also note that the patients with autoantibodies were not excluded from the primary analysis by Zhang et al., but this was done only in the post-hoc analysis.Most importantly, our negative findings are in full agreement with the recently published independent study of 586,157 individuals, including 20,952 cases of COVID-19 (4,928 hospitalized and 1,304 requiring ventilation or resulting in death) (5). There were no significant associations with any of the 13 candidate genes examined either individually or in aggregate, or when comparisons included all hospitalized cases or only the most severe cases. Indeed, none of the associations displayed even marginal significance. Therefore, consistent with our study, these findings do not support substantial contributions of inborn errors in type I IFN immunity to COVID-19 severity.These negative results underscore the importance of proper study design, selection of appropriate genetic models, adequate control for genetic ancestry, and adherence to unbiased methods for genetic discovery rather than focusing only on a candidate biological pathway.","Povysil, Gundula; Butler-Laporte, Guillaume; Gharavi, Ali G; Richards, J Brent; Goldstein, David B; Kiryluk, Krzysztof",The Journal of clinical investigation,216,1

Herein, SARS-CoV-2 proteome-wide immunoprofiling of children with mild/moderate or severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) versus multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children versus hospitalized control patients revealed differential cytokine responses, IgM/IgG/IgA epitope diversity, antibody binding and avidity. Apart from spike and nucleocapsid, IgG/IgA recognized epitopes in nonstructural protein (NSP) 2, NSP3, NSP12-NSP14 and open reading frame (ORF) 3a-ORF9. Peptides representing epitopes in NSP12, ORF3a and ORF8 demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 serodiagnosis. Antibody-binding kinetics with 24 SARS-CoV-2 proteins revealed antibody parameters that distinguish children with mild/moderate versus severe COVID-19 or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Antibody avidity to prefusion spike correlated with decreased illness severity and served as a clinical disease indicator. The fusion peptide and heptad repeat 2 region induced SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in rabbits. Thus, we identified SARS-CoV-2 antibody signatures in children associated with disease severity and delineate promising serodiagnostic and virus neutralization targets. These findings might guide the design of serodiagnostic assays, prognostic algorithms, therapeutics and vaccines in this important but understudied population.","Ravichandran, Supriya; Tang, Juanjie; Grubbs, Gabrielle; Lee, Youri; Pourhashemi, Sara; Hussaini, Laila; Lapp, Stacey A; Jerris, Robert C; Singh, Vidisha; Chahroudi, Ann; Anderson, Evan J; Rostad, Christina A; Khurana, Surender",Nature immunology,216,26

As sequence databases continue to grow exponentially, it becomes increasingly important to repeat searches at frequent intervals, and similarity searches retrieve larger and larger sets of results. New and potentially significant results may be buried in a long list of previously obtained sequence hits from past searches. RESULTS: ReHAB (Recent Hits Acquired from BLAST) is a tool for finding new protein hits in repeated PSI-BLAST searches. ReHAB compares results from PSI-BLAST searches performed with two versions of a protein sequence database and highlights hits that are present only in the updated database. Results are presented in an easily comprehended table, or in a BLAST-like report, using colors to highlight the new hits. ReHAB is designed to handle large numbers of query sequences, such as whole genomes or sets of genomes. Advanced computer skills are not needed to use ReHAB; the graphics interface is simple to use and was designed with the bench biologist in mind. CONCLUSIONS: This software greatly simplifies the problem of evaluating the output of large numbers of protein database searches.","Whitney, Joe; Esteban, David J; Upton, Chris",BMC Bioinformatics,216,16

TMPRSS2 is an attractive target and has received significant attention for the development of drugs against SARS and MERS. Starting with comparative structural modeling and binding model analysis, we developed an efficient pharmacophore-based approach and applied in a large-scale in silico database screening for small molecule inhibitors against TMPRSS2. A number of novel inhibitors were identified, providing starting points for further development of drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19.","Hu, Xin; Shrimp, Jonathan H.; Guo, Hui; Zakharov, Alexey; Jain, Sankalp; Shinn, Paul; Simeonov, Anton; Hall, Matthew D.; Shen, Min",bioRxiv,216,14

In this online cross-sectional study, sociodemographic and occupational characteristics, role conflict, and ambiguity of 432 nurses were assessed using the Bowling Scale for Role Conflict and Ambiguity and stress was assessed using the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale from September 27 to October 17, 2020. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for above-median stress levels of nurses with average and high (2nd and 3rd tertiles) role conflict and ambiguity compared with nurses with low role conflict and ambiguity (1st tertile). The mean (standard deviation) age of the nurses was 36.5 ± 6.6 years, and 25.9% of them were males. After adjusting for PHC type and working hours, nurses with average and high role conflict had significantly higher stress rates than those with low role conflict, with ORs (95% CIs) of 2.69 (1.62–4.46) and 6.31 (3.78–10.53), respectively. Similarly, nurses with average- and high-role ambiguity had significantly higher stress than those with low role ambiguity, with ORs (95% CIs) of 2.15 (1.30–3.55) and 7.68 (4.54–13.01), respectively. Increasing stress rates were detected across increasing categories of role conflict and ambiguity (P values for trend <.001). We found that role conflict and ambiguity were associated with stress among nurses in PHCs in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alyahya, Saad A.; Al-Mansour, Khalid A.; Alkohaiz, Mohammed A.; Almalki, Mansour A.",Medicine (Baltimore),216,24

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our study employed a projective quantitative research design. SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis was used to map ARS internal competencies towards external contexts, and potential opportunities and risks in the robotic market. The ARS purchase and procedural costs were evaluated in two different scenarios. RESULTS: In the first scenario, setting the purchase cost of the Avatera at around $1.3–1.5 million, a total $400 procedural cost reduction compared to the RAS performed with the da Vinci Xi can be calculated. In the second scenario, with a purchase cos of the ARS of $700.000–800.000 and considering a 5-year period with an annual ARS volume of 500 procedures, only an additional $300 will be attributed to the robot itself. Our projections revealed that for an effective competition the purchase cost of ARS should range between $700.000 and $800.000 during the initial phase of market entry. The marketing strategy of the ARS should be oriented towards countries without any robotic system in operational use, followed by countries where the competition intensity in the marketplace is low. CONCLUSION: The introduction of new robotic systems will greatly affect and reshape the market of robotic surgery. The ARS has all the technical capacity ensuring the performance of high-quality surgical procedures. A fast spread and implementation of the ARS could be expected should the purchase and maintenance costs be kept low.","Liatsikos, Evangelos; Tsaturyan, Arman; Kyriazis, Iason; Kallidonis, Panagiotis; Manolopoulos, Dimitris; Magoutas, Anastasios",World J Urol,216,12

Varying programs that reimburse pharmacists for conduct of medication reviews are in place in different jurisdictions in Canada and other countries around the world. The MedsCheck Diabetes (MCD) program is a publicly funded service in Ontario, Canada, offered to patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Through this service, pharmacists can complete a focused medication review with advice, training, monitoring and follow-up diabetes education. Although pharmacists can be reimbursed for patient follow-up activities, a low number of follow-up medication reviews are billed through this program. METHODS: The study explores the barriers and facilitators that community pharmacists in Ontario experience in conducting routine monitoring and follow-up of patients with diabetes. Using a descriptive content analysis approach study, semistructured interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of 8 community pharmacists working in Ontario. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged: the design of the MCD program, the state of community pharmacy and collaboration and relationships. These themes demonstrate challenges and potential strategies recognized by community pharmacists to conduct routine diabetes follow-up through the MCD program. CONCLUSION: This study found that the design of the MedsCheck Diabetes program, the community pharmacy environment and the relationships between pharmacists, patients and prescribers can pose a challenge in the conduct of routine monitoring and follow-up through the MedsCheck Diabetes program.","Surkic, Natali; Mathers, Annalise; Kellar, Jamie; MacCallum, Lori; Dolovich, Lisa",Can Pharm J (Ott),216,29

Limitations of oro-nasopharyngeal real-time PCR sensitivity have been described based on comparisons of single tests with repeated sampling. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 PCR clinical sensitivity using a clinical and radiological reference standard. METHODS: Between March-May 2020, 2060 patients underwent thoracic imaging and SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Imaging was independently double- or triple-reported (if discordance) by blinded radiologists according to radiological criteria for COVID-19. We excluded asymptomatic patients and those with alternative diagnoses that could explain imaging findings. Associations with PCR-positivity were assessed with binomial logistic regression. RESULTS: 901 patients had possible/probable imaging features and clinical symptoms of COVID-19 and 429 patients met the clinical and radiological reference case definition. SARS-CoV-2 PCR sensitivity was 68% (95% confidence interval 64-73), was highest 7-8 days after symptom onset (78% (68-88)) and was lower among current smokers (adjusted odds ratio 0.23 (0.12-0.42) p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with clinical and imaging features of COVID-19, PCR test sensitivity was 68%, and was lower among smokers; a finding that could explain observations of lower disease incidence and that warrants further validation.

Despite substantial ramp-up in test volume, access to SARS-CoV-2 testing remains limited, heterogeneous, and insufficient to control spread. METHODS: We compared SARS-CoV-2 testing rates across geographic regions, over time, and by demographic characteristics (i.e., age and racial/ethnic groups) in Illinois during March through December 2020. We compared age-matched case fatality ratios and infection fatality ratios through time to estimate the fraction of SARS-CoV-2 infections that have been detected through diagnostic testing. RESULTS: By the end of 2020, initial geographic differences in testing rates had closed substantially. Case fatality ratios were higher in non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latino populations in Illinois relative to non-Hispanic White populations, suggesting that tests were insufficient to accurately capture the true burden of COVID-19 disease in the minority populations during the initial epidemic wave. While testing disparities decreased during 2020, Hispanic/Latino populations consistently remained the least tested at 1.87 tests per 1000 population per day compared with 2.58 and 2.87 for non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White populations, respectively, at the end of 2020. Despite a large expansion in testing since the beginning of the first wave of the epidemic, we estimated that over half (50–80%) of all SARS-CoV-2 infections were not detected by diagnostic testing and continued to evade surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic methods for identifying relatively under-tested geographic regions and demographic groups may enable policymakers to regularly monitor and evaluate the shifting landscape of diagnostic testing, allowing officials to prioritize allocation of testing resources to reduce disparities in COVID-19 burden and eventually reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Holden, Tobias M; Richardson, Reese A.K.; Arevalo, Philip; Duffus, Wayne A.; Runge, Manuela; Whitney, Elena; Wise, Leslie; Ezike, Ngozi O.; Patrick, Sarah; Cobey, Sarah; Gerardin, Jaline",medRxiv,216,21

Thus, there is a desire to lose weight with a variety of efforts, such as fad diets. This type of diet can lead to insufficient intake of nutrients in the body and increase the risk of health problems in the long run. The research aimed to analyze fad diets, nutritional status, and nutritional adequacy of female models in Malang. The research design was cross-sectional in 52 female models aged 18–25 years who were selected by simple random sampling. The data of fad diets used in the questionnaire, nutritional status data using the calculation of the last body weight and height, and nutritional adequacy were measured using 2 × 24 hour food recall. Data analysis used the chi-square test. The results of this research showed that most respondents implement fad diets (69%), had negative body image (62%), had a skinny at high level (22%), skinny at mild level (44%), and normal (33%) of nutritional status, and had inadequate nutritional adequacy (77%). There was a significant (p=0.023) correlation between fad diets and nutritional adequacy (r = 0.369), and in addition, there was a significant correlation (p=0.041) between nutritional status and nutritional adequacy (r = 0.35). It is concluded that the female models who implemented fad diets and nutritional status below normal tended to not have adequate levels of nutritional adequacy because of improper food selection and psychological factors.

To protect against these enteropathogens, the induction of intestinal secretory IgA (SIgA) responses is paramount. While systemic vaccination provides strong systemic immune responses, oral vaccination is the most efficient way to trigger protective SIgA responses. However, the development of oral vaccines, especially oral subunit vaccines, is challenging due to mechanisms inherent to the gut. Oral vaccines need to survive the harsh environment in the gastrointestinal tract, characterized by low pH and intestinal proteases and need to reach the gut-associated lymphoid tissues, which are protected by chemical and physical barriers that prevent efficient uptake. Furthermore, they need to surmount default tolerogenic responses present in the gut, resulting in suppression of immunity or tolerance. Several strategies have been developed to tackle these hurdles, such as delivery systems that protect vaccine antigens from degradation, strong mucosal adjuvants that induce robust immune responses and targeting approaches that aim to selectively deliver vaccine antigens towards specific immune cell populations. In this review, we discuss recent advances in oral vaccine design to enable the induction of robust gut immunity and highlight that the development of next generation oral subunit vaccines will require approaches that combines these solutions.","Van der Weken, Hans; Cox, Eric; Devriendt, Bert",Vaccines (Basel),216,28

Bradykinin type 1 (B1R) and type 2 (B2R) receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors that sense and mediate the effects of kinins. While B2R is constitutively expressed and regulates a plethora of physiological processes, B1R is almost undetectable under physiological conditions and contributes to pathological inflammation. Several KKS components (kininogens, tissue and plasma kallikreins, and kinin receptors) are overexpressed in human and animal models of retinal diseases, and their inhibition, particularly B1R, reduces inflammation and pathological neovascularization. In this review, we provide an overview of the KKS with emphasis on kinin receptors in the healthy retina and their detrimental roles in DR and AMD. We highlight the crosstalk between the KKS and the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), which is known to be detrimental in ocular pathologies. Targeting the KKS, particularly the B1R, is a promising therapy in retinal diseases, and B1R may represent an effector of the detrimental effects of RAS (Ang II-AT1R).","Othman, Rahmeh; Cagnone, Gael; Joyal, Jean-Sébastien; Vaucher, Elvire; Couture, Réjean",Cells,216,1

The research conducted aims to fill the gap of literature related to social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research aims at uncovering the influences of social media use in several dimensions during lockdown(s). The study aims to answer the research question of: Are the influences of social media use different from normal times? The online questionnaire has been completed by six hundred and sixty-eight users within the period of lockdown. The author prepared the questionnaire, which is composed of 22 positive statements in order to evaluate the effects of social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic. A 5 point Likert scale was used, where reliability and validity were calculated by the Cronbach's alpha value, which was 0.751. Findings highlight that users have more information about COVID-19, and they follow recent information via social media, which shows the shift towards digital medium. Findings also indicate that users are aware of fake news, and they follow official sources. Social media is powerful to affect decision-makers, and respondents' social media use did not create any panic or anxiety amongst them. This research indicates that respondents' social media use during COVID-19 is different from normal times as a common purpose triggers this, survival. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most of social media shares were like a dream or a strong desire that may cause anxiety in others. During the pandemic, people are in lockdown and share similar feelings and follow similar behavioural patterns. As there is a common purpose and struggle via users, psychological well-being is not affected negatively.","Kaya, Tugberk",Technol Soc,216,3

Background: COVID-19 has had widespread implications for primary healthcare nurses. Supporting these nurses' capacity to deliver quality care ensures that ongoing health needs can be met. Methods: Primary healthcare nurses were recruited to an online survey via social media and professional organisations in April 2020. Results: Six-hundred and thirty-seven responses were included in analysis. Participants provided 1213 statements about perceived supports required to provide quality clinical care. From these, seven key categories emerged, namely; personal protective equipment, communication, funding, industrial issues, self-care, workplace factors and valuing nurses. Conclusion: A number of key issues relating to personal health and safety, care quality, and job security need to be addressed to support primary healthcare nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressing these support issues can assist in retaining nurses and optimising the role of primary healthcare nurses during a pandemic. Implications for nursing management: Responding to the needs of primary healthcare nurses has the potential to facilitate their role in providing community-based healthcare.

The Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) registry was created to compare peripartum outcomes and anesthetic utilization in women with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection delivering at institutions with widespread testing. METHODS: Deliveries from 14 US medical centers, from March 19 to May 31, 2020, were included. Peripartum infection was defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test within 14 days of delivery. Consecutive SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with randomly selected control patients were sampled (1:2 ratio) with controls delivering during the same day without a positive test. Outcomes were obstetric (eg, delivery mode, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and delivery <37 weeks), an adverse neonatal outcome composite measure (primary), and anesthetic utilization (eg, neuraxial labor analgesia and anesthesia). Outcomes were analyzed using generalized estimating equations to account for clustering within centers. Sensitivity analyses compared symptomatic and asymptomatic patients to controls. RESULTS: One thousand four hundred fifty four peripartum women were included: 490 with SARS-CoV-2 infection (176 [35.9%] symptomatic) and 964 were controls. SARS-CoV-2 patients were slightly younger, more likely nonnulliparous, nonwhite, and Hispanic than controls. They were more likely to have diabetes, obesity, or cardiac disease and less likely to have autoimmune disease. After adjustment for confounders, individuals experiencing SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited an increased risk for delivery <37 weeks of gestation compared to controls, 73 (14.8%) vs 98 (10.2%) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-2.09). Effect estimates for other obstetric outcomes and the neonatal composite outcome measure were not meaningfully different between SARS-CoV-2 patients versus controls. In sensitivity analyses, compared to controls, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients exhibited increases in cesarean delivery (aOR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.09-2.27), postpartum length of stay (aOR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.18-2.60), and delivery <37 weeks of gestation (aOR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.29-3.36). These adverse outcomes were not found in asymptomatic women versus controls. SARS-CoV-2 patients (asymptomatic and symptomatic) were less likely to receive neuraxial labor analgesia (aOR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.35-0.75) and more likely to receive general anesthesia for cesarean delivery (aOR, 3.69; 95% CI, 1.40-9.74) due to maternal respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, multicenter US cohort study of women with and without peripartum SARS-CoV-2 infection, differences in obstetric and neonatal outcomes seem to be mostly driven by symptomatic patients. Lower utilization of neuraxial analgesia in laboring patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic infection compared to patients without infection requires further investigation.","Katz, Daniel; Bateman, Brian T; Kjaer, Klaus; Turner, Dana P; Spence, Nicole Z; Habib, Ashraf S; George, Ronald B; Toledano, Roulhac D; Grant, Gilbert; Madden, Hannah E; Butwick, Alex J; Lynde, Grant; Minehart, Rebecca D; Beilin, Yaakov; Houle, Timothy T; Sharpe, Emily E; Kodali, Bhavani; Bharadwaj, Shobana; Farber, Michaela K; Palanisamy, Arvind; Prabhu, Malavika; Gonzales, Nikolai Y; Landau, Ruth; Leffert, Lisa",Anesth Analg,216,6

Identifying mood states experienced in lockdown and self-regulating strategies is useful for the development of interventions to help mood management. Whilst this can be done on a general level, examination of sport-specific effects and the experience of athletes and coaches can help develop interventions grounded in real world experiences. The present study investigated perceived differences in mood states of boxers before and during COVID-19 isolation in the first lockdown among boxers. Boxing is an individual and high-contact sport where training tends to form a key aspect of their identity. Boxers develop close relationships with their coach and boxing. Hence boxers were vulnerable to experiencing negative mood, and support via the coach was potentially unavailable. Participants were 58 experienced participants (44 boxers, male n = 33, female n = 11; 14 boxing coaches, male n = 11, female n = 3). Boxers completed the Brunel Mood Scale to assess mood before COVID-19 using a retrospective approach and during COVID-19 using a “right now” time frame. Boxers responded to open-ended questions to capture mood regulation strategies used. Coaches responded to open ended questions to capture how they helped regulate boxer’s mood. MANOVA results indicated a large significant increase in the intensity of unpleasant moods (anger, confusion, depression, fatigue, and tension) and reduction in vigor during COVID-19 (d = 0.93). Using Lane and Terry (2000) conceptual framework, results showed participants reporting depressed mood also reported an extremely negative mood profile as hypothesized. Qualitative data indicated that effective mood-regulation strategies used included maintaining close coach-athlete contact and helping create a sense of making progress in training. When seen collectively, findings illustrate that mood state responses to COVID-19 were severe. It is suggested that that active self-regulation and self-care should be a feature of training programmes to aid coaches and boxers in regulating mood when faced with severe situational changes.","Roberts, Reece J.; Lane, Andrew M.",Front Psychol,216,16

We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: The REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide. Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor before admission. Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin–angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system. The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation. Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04338009. FINDINGS: Between March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, 152 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy (continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77). Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m(2) (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes. Compared with discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40–110] for continuation vs 81 [38–117] for discontinuation; β-coefficient 8 [95% CI −13 to 29]). There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died. 29 (39%) participants in the continuation group and 28 (36%) participants in the discontinuation group had at least one adverse event (χ(2) test of adverse events between treatment groups p=0·77). There was no difference in blood pressure, serum potassium, or creatinine during follow-up across the two groups.

The aim is to keep patient safety as the priority, besides, continuing to provide essential healthcare services. METHODS: Situational audit was performed for the services rendered before and during COVID-19 pandemic and the elevation of the disease alert status, and a retrospective analysis of the attendance and procedures performed in the service. RESULTS: We present a methodology for performing a situational audit and generating service modification for hand and reconstructive microsurgery unit in a pandemic. There was no significant difference between the number of patients seen at outpatient clinics. However, there was a reduction in the numbers of total surgeries performed, with a 40% drop in the number of elective surgeries performed. There was also a reduction of cases seen in the emergency department hand clinic. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 pandemic is currently affecting not only the health service but also, other vital services all over the world. The pandemic puts significant challenges to acute surgical services in a hospital system involved in the management of the pandemic. Surgeons need to take proactive and a systematic approach in managing the available resources while maintaining essential surgical services.

The infection is causing a high mortality in old people, especially those with obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D) or cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Extra cautions are needed in the treatment of those patients. The CVD drugs ACEIs and ARBs, as well as the T2D drugs GLP-1R agonists, were shown to activate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression in experimental animals. Elevated ACE2 expression may accelerate virus entrance into the host cells during the infection for its replication. However, expression of the soluble ACE2, may neutralize the virus to limit the infection and replication. Given that obese, diabetes and CVD patients often take those medicines in the treatment and prevention of blood pressure and glucose elevation, it remains to be determined whether those medicines represent friend or foe in the treatment of COVID-19. We suggest that retrospective studies should be conducted to determine the exact impact of those medicines in obese, diabetic, or CVD patients who had COVID-19. Results obtained will provide guidance whether those drugs can be utilized in COVID-19 patients with obesity, diabetic, or CVD.","Pang, Juan; Liu, Mingyao; Ling, Wenhua; Jin, Tianru",Obes Med,216,20

A survey was conducted to assess the changes in the care of gynaecologic oncology patients in India. METHODS: An online survey enquiring about the patient volumes and surgical load, and changes in practice protocols for endometrial, ovarian, cervical and vulval cancers was conducted in May, 2020. RESULTS: The total number of responses received was 153. Barring duplicates, 148 were analysed. There was a significant drop in gynaecologic oncology patients attending government hospitals as compared to the non-government sector. The drop was not significantly different in areas having low versus high COVID-19 case volumes. The treatment of endometrial cancers remained the same although there was a marked shift from minimal access surgery to conventional surgery. Advanced ovarian cancer was mostly managed by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Cervical and vulval cancer management remained the same, but radiotherapy protocols were modified by most. CONCLUSION: Based on clinician responses, it appears that most practices across India have suffered a fall in patient volumes. The responses from government sectors point towards a bigger hit in this segment of practice. While the management of endometrial cancers and cervical cancers was mostly unchanged, most cases of advanced ovarian cancer received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Cervical cancer, when managed by chemoradiation, was likely to have altered radiation schedules.","Subbian, Anbukkani; Kaur, Satinder; Patel, Viral; Rajanbabu, Anupama",Ecancermedicalscience,216,21

This single-centre prospective cohort study was performed in the Emergency Department of a tertiary care hospital. Patients, 65 years and older, with suspected COVID-19 presenting to the Emergency Department during the first wave of the pandemic were consecutively enrolled.

At first glance, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic and orthopedics may seem to be unrelated disciplines, but the provision of healthcare services to patients who require them proves that these two fields are parts of the same whole. Our experiences in treating neutropenic, lymphocytopenic, and chemotherapy patients seem to have proven beneficial during this process. We operated on 10 biopsy patients, 15 primary bone sarcomas, 9 soft tissue sarcomas, and 82 trauma patients within this time frame. Only three patients were suspected to have COVID‐19 before admission. The early identification, strict isolation, and effective treatment of these patients prevented any nosocomial infections and disease‐related comorbidities. This success is the result of the multidisciplinary cooperation of the Ministry of Health, our hospital, and our clinic.","Şahbat, Yavuz; Buyuktopcu, Omer; Topkar, Osman Mert; Erol, Bulent",J Surg Oncol,216,27

There is an urgent need to develop an effective vaccine within a highly accelerated time. Here, we present the most comprehensive S-protein-based linear B-cell epitope candidate list by combining epitopes predicted by eight widely-used immune-informatics methods with the epitopes curated from literature published between Feb 6, 2020 and July 10, 2020. We find four top prioritized linear B-cell epitopes in the hotspot regions of S protein can specifically bind with serum antibodies from horse, mouse, and monkey inoculated with different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates or a patient recovering from COVID-19. The four linear B-cell epitopes can induce neutralizing antibodies against both pseudo and live SARS-CoV-2 virus in immunized wild-type BALB/c mice. This study suggests that the four linear B-cell epitopes are potentially important candidates for serological assay or vaccine development.","Li, Lin; Zhao, Zhongpeng; Yang, Xiaolan; Li, Wendong; Chen, Shaolong; Sun, Ting; Wang, Lu; He, Yufei; Liu, Guang; Han, Xiaohan; Wen, Hao; Liu, Yong; Chen, Yifan; Wang, Haoyu; Li, Jing; Su, Zhongyi; Du, Chen; Wang, Yiting; Li, Xinyang; Yang, Zeqian; Wang, Jie; Li, Min; Wang, Tiecheng; Wang, Ying; Fan, Yubo; Wang, Hui; Zhang, Jing",bioRxiv,216,3

Particularly, the identification of circulating cell-free chemical and biochemical substances, cellular and subcellular entities, and extracellular vesicles has demonstrated promising applications in understanding the physiologic and pathologic conditions of an individual. Traditionally, tissue biopsy has been the gold standard for the diagnosis of many diseases, especially cancer. More recently, liquid biopsy for biomarker detection has emerged as a non-invasive or minimally invasive and less costly method for diagnosis of both cancerous and non-cancerous diseases, while also offering information on the progression or improvement of disease. Unfortunately, the standardization of analytical methods to isolate and quantify circulating cells and extracellular vesicles, as well as their extracted biochemical constituents, is still cumbersome, time-consuming, and expensive. To address these limitations, we have developed a prototype of a portable, miniaturized instrument that uses immunoaffinity capillary electrophoresis (IACE) to isolate, concentrate, and analyze cell-free biomarkers and/or tissue or cell extracts present in biological fluids. Isolation and concentration of analytes is accomplished through binding to one or more biorecognition affinity ligands immobilized to a solid support, while separation and analysis are achieved by high-resolution capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled to one or more detectors. When compared to other existing methods, the process of this affinity capture, enrichment, release, and separation of one or a panel of biomarkers can be carried out on-line with the advantages of being rapid, automated, and cost-effective. Additionally, it has the potential to demonstrate high analytical sensitivity, specificity, and selectivity. As the potential of liquid biopsy grows, so too does the demand for technical advances. In this review, we therefore discuss applications and limitations of liquid biopsy and hope to introduce the idea that our affinity capture-separation device could be used as a form of point-of-care (POC) diagnostic technology to isolate, concentrate, and analyze circulating cells, extracellular vesicles, and viruses.","Guzman, Norberto A.; Guzman, Daniel E.",Biomedicines,216,1

The pandemic has had unprecedented worldwide implications, in particular on marginalized populations. AIMS: The aim of this study is to review the impact of the pandemic on patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. METHOD: A number of databases were searched for this review, including PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Google Scholar. Search terms included psychosis and COVID-19, schizophrenia and COVID-19, and severe mental illness and COVID-19. We included all English language papers and preprints. The final search was done on 15 July 2020. RESULTS: Forty-seven relevant studies were identified and included in this review. Studies were summarised into five main subcategories: potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical health outcomes of patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, impact on mental health outcomes, review of case reports and case series to date, treatment recommendation guidelines and risk of increased prevalence of psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders may be vulnerable to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This patient population has a number of risk factors, including psychosocial adversities and illness related factors.

OBJECTIVE: To study whether the number of children admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for DKA due to new-onset T1D increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether SARS-CoV-2 infection plays a role. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study comprises two datasets: (1) children admitted to PICU due to new-onset T1D and (2) children diagnosed with new-onset T1D and registered to the Finnish Pediatric Diabetes Registry in the Helsinki University Hospital from 1 April to 31 October in 2016–2020. We compared the incidence, number and characteristics of children with newly diagnosed T1D between the prepandemic and pandemic periods. RESULTS: The number of children admitted to PICU due to new-onset T1D increased from an average of 6.25 admissions in 2016–2019 to 20 admissions in 2020 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 3.24 [95% CI 1.80 to 5.83]; p=0.0001). On average, 57.75 children were registered to the FPDR in 2016–2019, as compared with 84 in 2020 (IRR 1.45; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.86; p=0.004). 33 of the children diagnosed in 2020 were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and all were negative. CONCLUSIONS: More children with T1D had severe DKA at diagnosis during the pandemic. This was not a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Instead, it probably stems from delays in diagnosis following changes in parental behaviour and healthcare accessibility.","Salmi, Heli; Heinonen, Santtu; Hästbacka, Johanna; Lääperi, Mitja; Rautiainen, Paula; Miettinen, Päivi J; Vapalahti, Olli; Hepojoki, Jussi; Knip, Mikael",Arch Dis Child,216,28

The Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s leading epidemiological authority, regards the risk of infection for the general population to be high. The aim of this article is to discuss and reassess the risk of infection and disease for healthcare workers based on practical experience, national regulations and guidelines, and the number of infections. Both unprotected healthcare workers and healthcare workers equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE) are considered. A corresponding risk matrix is created. The risk of infection with SAR-CoV‑2 for healthcare workers is comparable to the general population and rated as high. Proper use of PPE reduces this risk to medium. PPE consists of liquid-proof gowns, gloves, and filtering face pieces (FFP; FFP 2 as a standard, FFP 3 for aerosol-releasing interventions), a hair cover, and protective goggles.

Differential diagnosis of FDG-avid interstitial lung disease in low-prevalence regions,15.827813,8.8878355,2020-10-19,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare the outcome of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients who received endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) with confirmed COVID-19 to those without. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis using the Vizient Clinical Data Base and included hospital discharges from April 1 to July 31 2020 with ICD-10 codes for AIS and EVT. The primary outcome was in-hospital death and the secondary outcome was favorable discharge, defined as discharge home or to acute rehabilitation. We compared patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 to those without. As a sensitivity analysis, we compared COVID-19 AIS patients who did not undergo EVT to those who did, to balance potential adverse events inherent to COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: We identified 3165 AIS patients who received EVT during April to July 2020, in which COVID-19 was confirmed in 104 (3.3%). Comorbid COVID-19 infection was associated with younger age, male sex, diabetes, black race, Hispanic ethnicity, intubation, acute coronary syndrome, acute renal failure, and longer hospital and intensive care unit length of stay. The rate of in-hospital death was 12.4% without COVID-19 vs 29.8% with COVID-19 (P<0.001). In mixed-effects logistic regression that accounted for patient clustering by hospital, comorbid COVID-19 increased the odds of in-hospital death over four-fold (OR 4.48, 95% CI 3.02 to 6.165). Comorbid COVID-19 was also associated with lower odds of a favorable discharge (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.61). In the sensitivity analysis, comparing AIS patients with COVID-19 who did not undergo EVT (n=2139) to the AIS EVT patients with COVID-19, there was no difference in the rate of in-hospital death (30.6% vs 29.8%, P=0.868), and AIS EVT patients had a higher rate of favorable discharge (32.4% vs 47.1%, P=0.002). CONCLUSION: In AIS patients treated with EVT, comorbid COVID-19 infection was associated with in-hospital death and a lower odds of favorable discharge compared with patients without COVID-19, but not compared with AIS patients with COVID-19 who did not undergo EVT. AIS EVT patients with COVID-19 were younger, more likely to be male, have systemic complications, and almost twice as likely to be black and over three times as likely to be Hispanic.","de Havenon, Adam; Yaghi, Shadi; Mistry, Eva A; Delic, Alen; Hohmann, Samuel; Shippey, Ernie; Stulberg, Eric; Tirschwell, David; Frontera, Jennifer A; Petersen, Nils H; Anadani, Mohammad",J Neurointerv Surg,216,30

This study is aimed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of ozone therapy (OT), as an adjuvant to the standard of care (SOC). Methods In the current randomized control trial, 60 patients with mild to moderate score NEWS score were included in two parallel groups (n=30/group). The interventional group (OZ) received ozonizedrectal insufflation and minor auto haemotherapy, daily along with SOC, while the control group (ST) received SOC alone. The main outcome measures included changes in clinical features, oxygenation index (SpO2), NEWS score, Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR), inflammatory markers, requirement of advanced care, and metabolic profiles. Results The OZ group has shown clinically significant improvement in the mean values of all the parameters tested compared to ST Group. However, statistical significant were only observed in RT-PCR negative reaction (P=0.01), changes in clinical symptoms (P<0.05) and requirement for Intensive care (P<0.05). No adverse events were reported in OZ group, as against 2 deaths reported in ST group. Conclusion OT when integrated with SOC can improve the clinical status and rapidly reduce the viral load compared to SOC alone, which facilitate early recovery and check the need for advanced care and mortality as demonstrated in this study.

The alternative is to design a web-based application exploiting Web Socket. This research paper concerns the real-time six-parameter vital-sign monitoring using a web-based application. The six vital-sign parameters are electrocardiogram, temperature, plethysmogram, percent saturation oxygen, blood pressure and heart rate. The six vital-sign parameters were encoded in a web server site and sent to a client site upon logging on. The encoded parameters were then decoded into six vital sign signals. Our proposed multi-parameter vital-sign telemedicine system using Web Socket has successfully remotely monitored the six-parameter vital signs on 4G mobile network with a latency of less than 5 milliseconds.","Pintavirooj, Chuchart; Keatsamarn, Tanapon; Treebupachatsakul, Treesukon",Healthcare (Basel),216,26

Using a victim-centred approach involving qualitative, in-depth interviews with 71 people, who perceived their encounters with the police enforcing COVID-19 measures as bordering on their rights, were conducted, and a thematic analysis of the narratives carried out. Participants reported significant variety of police aggression directed towards them: including actual threats of physical violence, hostility, intimidation, extortion, and punishment. Female participants reported incidents of sexual harassment, unwanted sexual advances, and assault.

We have modelled the suitable habitat of major lac host B. monosperma using MAXENT for the current and future climatic scenarios (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5). The study suggested the dominance of suitable habitats of B. monosperma in central-eastern to eastern and southern parts of the country. Temperature seasonality (Bio_4) was the most significant bioclimatic variable in regulating the distribution of B. monosperma followed by elevation and annual precipitation (Bio_13). The projection for the year 2050 suggested the habitat shift towards the eastern and southern parts. The study indicated the major habitat of B. monosperma continued to exist in the Chotanagpur plateau in eastern India. The model predicted approximately a 9–13% decrease in the overall potential habitat of B. monosperma by 2050, and the distribution of species would be nearly extinct from the northern and western parts. Presently, only the 5% lac host trees are being utilised for lac cultivation, and the study suggested that conservation and promotion of B. monosperma on projected suitable habitats and even by utilising 25% of resources, the lac production may jump manifold catering to global demand, rural economy and employment and shall contribute towards ‘Self Reliant India’.","Tiwari, Sharad; Ghosh, Brojo Gopal; Vaidya, S.

To address this dementia care gap, we describe a Phase III efficacy trial testing an online platform, WeCareAdvisor, and design modifications necessitated by COVID-19. WeCareAdvisor provides caregivers with disease information, daily tips, and a systematic approach for describing behaviors, investigating underlying causes, creating tailored strategies, and evaluating their effectiveness (DICE). The trial will enroll 326 caregivers nationwide, randomly assign them to immediately receive WeCareAdvisor (treatment), or a 3-month waitlist (control) and evaluate short (1- and 3-month) and long-term (6-month) outcomes for caregiver distress with and confidence managing BPSD, and BPSD occurrences. We will also evaluate utilization patterns with different prompting conditions: high-intensity (telephone and email reminders), low-intensity (email reminders), or no reminders to use WeCareAdvisor. COVID-19 necessitated design modifications resulting in greater inclusivity of caregivers from diverse races, ethnicities, and geographic areas. Key modifications include shifting from in-home, in-person interviewing to telephone; adjusting tool functionality from operating on a grant-funded iPad to caregivers’ personal internet-capable devices; and expanding recruitment from one metropolitan area to nationwide. Study modifications necessitated by COVID-19 facilitate national outreach, easier tool adoption, and enable more diverse caregivers to participate.

To date only studies in the UK on hospital deaths have been published in the peer reviewed literature. Legal requirements for cremation in England and Wales require the collection of information that can be used to improve understanding of Covid 19 deaths in both hospital and community settings. Aim: To document demographic and clinical characteristics, including likely place of infection, of individuals dying of Covid 19 to inform public health policy Design: A comprehensive case series of deaths from Covid 19 between 6 April and 30 May. Setting: A crematorium in South Wales Participants: Individuals for whom an application was made for cremation. Main outcome measures: Age, sex, date and place of death, occupation, comorbidities, where infection acquired. Results: Of 752 cremations, 215(28.6%) were Covid-19 of which 115 (53.5%) were male and 100 (46.5%) female. The median age was 82 years, with the youngest patient being 47 years and the oldest 103 years. Over half the deaths (121/215: 56.3%) were over 80 years. Males odds of dying in hospital, rather than the community were 1.96 times that of females (95% Confidence Intervals (CI) 1.03 -3.74, p=0.054) despite being of similar age and having a similar number of comorbidities. Only 21(9.8%) of 215 patients had no comorbidities recorded. Patients dying in nursing homes were significantly older than those dying in hospital(median 88y (IQ range 82-93y) v 80y (IQ range 71-87y): p<0.0001). Patients dying in hospital had significantly more comorbidities than those dying in nursing homes (median 2: IQ range 1-3 v. 1: IQ range 1-2: p <0.001). Conclusions: In a representative series, comprising both hospital and community deaths, persons over 80 with an average 2 comorbidities predominated. Although men and women were represented in similar proportions, men were more likely to die in hospital. Over half the infections were acquired in either hospitals or nursing and residential homes with implications for the management of the pandemic, historically and in the future.","Salmon, R.

The question remains if there are other more infectious variants transmitted around the world. We carry out a large-scale study of 506,768 SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates from patients to identify many other rapidly growing mutations on the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). We reveal that essentially all 100 most observed mutations strengthen the binding between the RBD and the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), indicating the virus evolves toward more infectious variants. In particular, we discover new fast-growing RBD mutations N439K, S477N, S477R, and N501T that also enhance the RBD and ACE2 binding. We further unveil that mutation N501Y involved in United Kingdom (UK), South Africa, and Brazil variants may moderately weaken the binding between the RBD and many known antibodies, while mutations E484K and K417N found in South Africa and Brazilian variants, L452R and E484Q found in India variants, can potentially disrupt the binding between the RBD and many known antibodies. Among these RBD mutations, L452R is also now known as part of the California variant B.1.427. Finally, we hypothesize that RBD mutations that can simultaneously make SARS-CoV-2 more infectious and disrupt the existing antibodies, called vaccine escape mutations, will pose an imminent threat to the current crop of vaccines. A list of most likely vaccine escape mutations is given, including S494P, Q493L, K417N, F490S, F486L, R403K, E484K, L452R, K417T, F490L, E484Q, and A475S. Mutation T478K appears to make the Mexico variant B.1.1.222 the most infectious one. Our comprehensive genetic analysis and protein-protein binding study show that the genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 on the RBD, which may be regulated by host gene editing, viral proofreading, random genetic drift, and natural selection, gives rise to more infectious variants that will potentially compromise existing vaccines and antibody therapies.","Wang, Rui; Chen, Jiahui; Gao, Kaifu; Wei, Guo-Wei",Genomics,216,21

The trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein interacts with its receptor human ACE2 to mediate viral entry into host-cells. Here we present cryo-EM structures of an uncharacterized tightly closed SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer and the ACE2-bound-S-trimer at 2.7-Å and 3.8-Å-resolution, respectively. The tightly closed S-trimer with inactivated fusion peptide may represent the ground prefusion state. ACE2 binding to the up receptor-binding domain (RBD) within S-trimer triggers continuous swing-motions of ACE2-RBD, resulting in conformational dynamics of S1 subunits. Noteworthy, SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer appears much more sensitive to ACE2-receptor than SARS-CoV S-trimer in terms of receptor-triggered transformation from the closed prefusion state to the fusion-prone open state, potentially contributing to the superior infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. We defined the RBD T470-T478 loop and residue Y505 as viral determinants for specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by ACE2, and provided structural basis of the spike D614G-mutation induced enhanced infectivity. Our findings offer a thorough picture on the mechanism of ACE2-induced conformational transitions of S-trimer from ground prefusion state towards postfusion state, thereby providing important information for development of vaccines and therapeutics aimed to block receptor binding.","Xu, Cong; Wang, Yanxing; Liu, Caixuan; Zhang, Chao; Han, Wenyu; Hong, Xiaoyu; Wang, Yifan; Hong, Qin; Wang, Shutian; Zhao, Qiaoyu; Wang, Yalei; Yang, Yong; Chen, Kaijian; Zheng, Wei; Kong, Liangliang; Wang, Fangfang; Zuo, Qinyu; Huang, Zhong; Cong, Yao",bioRxiv,216,14

METHODS In this ongoing, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial, we investigated the safety, vaccine efficacy, and immunogenicity of two doses of AZD1222 as compared with placebo in preventing the onset of symptomatic and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) 15 days or more after the second dose in adults, including older adults, in the United States, Chile, and Peru. RESULTS A total of 32,451 participants underwent randomization, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive AZD1222 (21,635 participants) or placebo (10,816 participants). AZD1222 was safe, with low incidences of serious and medically attended adverse events and adverse events of special interest; the incidences were similar to those observed in the placebo group. Solicited local and systemic reactions were generally mild or moderate in both groups. Overall estimated vaccine efficacy was 74.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.3 to 80.5; P<0.001) and estimated vaccine efficacy was 83.5% (95% CI, 54.2 to 94.1) in participants 65 years of age or older. High vaccine efficacy was consistent across a range of demographic subgroups. In the fully vaccinated analysis subgroup, no severe or critical symptomatic Covid-19 cases were observed among the 17,662 participants in the AZD1222 group; 8 cases were noted among the 8550 participants in the placebo group (<0.1%). The estimated vaccine efficacy for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (nucleocapsid antibody seroconversion) was 64.3% (95% CI, 56.1 to 71.0; P<0.001).

In this context, the lung parenchyma is highly prone to ventilator-related injury, with pneumothorax and persistent air leak as the most serious adverse events. So far, endobronchial valve (EBV) positioning has proved efficacious in treating air leaks with a high success rate. CASE PRESENTATION: We report, for the first time, two cases of patients affected by SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia complicated with bacterial super-infection, experiencing pneumothorax and persistent air leaks after invasive mechanical ventilation. Despite the severity of respiratory failure both patients underwent rigid interventional bronchoscopy and were successfully treated through EBV positioning. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent air leaks may result from lung tissue damage due to a complex interaction between inflammation and ventilator-related injury (VILI), especially in the advanced stages of ARDS. EBV positioning seems to be a feasible and effective minimally invasive therapeutic option for treating this subset of patients.","Donatelli, Pierluigi; Trenatacosti, Fabiana; Pellegrino, Maria Rosaria; Tonelli, Roberto; Bruzzi, Giulia; Andreani, Alessandro; Cappiello, Gaia Francesca; Andrisani, Dario; Gozzi, Filippo; Mussini, Cristina; Busani, Stefano; Cavaliere, Gilda Valentina; Girardis, Massimo; Bertellini, Elisabetta; Clini, Enrico; Marchioni, Alessandro",BMC Pulm Med,216,28

BACKGROUND The hours and unpredictability of surgical practice often necessitate the employment of household extenders (eg, child caregivers) to maintain a safe home environment for surgeons and their families. The Covid-19 pandemic destabilized these relationships and provided an opportunity to reflect on the role that household extenders play in a surgical household. METHODS A multi-institutional telephone survey of surgeons practicing at five geographically diverse academic institutions was conducted (May 15, 2020-June 5, 2020). Surgeons were classified by change in household extenders (HE) during the pandemic (decrease, increase, no change, or none). The primary outcome was self-reported surgeon stress level. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the relationship between change in HE and surgeon stress, adjusting for training and relationship status, the presence of pets and children in the household, and study site. RESULTS The majority (182, 54.3%) of surgeons employed HE before the pandemic; 121 (36.1%) reported a decrease in HE during the pandemic, 9 (2.7%) reported an increase, and 52 (15.5%) reported no change. Stress scores varied significantly by change in HE group (P = 0.016). After controlling for potential confounders, having an increase in HE was associated with a higher stress score (+1.55 points) than having no decrease in HE (P = 0.033), and having a decrease in HE was associated with a higher stress score (+0.96 points) than having no decrease (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS Household extenders play a vital and complex role in enabling the healthcare workforce to care of the population. Surgeons who experienced a change in household extenders reported the highest stress levels. We suggest that health systems should proactively support surgeons by supporting the household extender workforce.","Mavroudis, Catherine L; Bergmark, Regan W; Waljee, Jennifer; Wick, Elizabeth; Yeo, Heather; Wirtalla, Christopher; Kelz, Rachel R",Annals of surgery,216,24

Air pollution is one crucial example. Established evidence from other respiratory viruses and emerging evidence for COVID-19 specifically indicates that air pollution alters respiratory defense mechanisms leading to worsened infection severity. Air pollution also contributes to co-morbidities that are known to worsen outcomes amongst those infected with COVID-19, and air pollution may also enhance infection transmission due to its impact on more frequent coughing. Yet despite the massive disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are reasons for optimism: broad societal lockdowns have shown us a glimpse of what a future with strong air pollution measures could yield. Thus, the urgency to combat air pollution is not diminished, but instead heightened in the context of the pandemic.","Brauer, Michael; Casadei, Barbara; Harrington, Robert A; Kovacs, Richard; Sliwa, Karen",Eur Heart J,216,1

We previously built fully glycosylated full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein models in a viral membrane including both open and closed conformations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and different templates for the stalk region. In this work, multiple μs-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed to provide deeper insights into the structure and dynamics of S protein and glycan functions. Our simulations reveal that the highly flexible stalk is composed of two independent joints and most probable S protein orientations are competent for ACE2 binding. We identify multiple glycans stabilizing the open and/or closed states of the RBD and demonstrate that the exposure of antibody epitopes can be captured by detailed antibody–glycan clash analysis instead of commonly used accessible surface area analysis that tends to overestimate the impact of glycan shielding and neglect possible detailed interactions between glycan and antibodies. Overall, our observations offer structural and dynamic insights into the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and potentialize for guiding the design of effective antiviral therapeutics.","Choi, Yeol Kyo; Cao, Yiwei; Frank, Martin; Woo, Hyeonuk; Park, Sang-Jun; Yeom, Min Sun; Croll, Tristan I.; Seok, Chaok; Im, Wonpil",J Chem Theory Comput,216,30

Age and employment were negatively associated with depression and economic fears related to COVID-19 that, in turn, were negatively associated with individual function. The effect of age and employment on individual function was fully mediated via depression and economic fears related to COVID-19.

To study the functions of the S protein, we describe here the generation of SARS-CoV S protein-bearing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotype using a VSV∆G∗/GFP system in which the G gene is replaced by the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene (VSV-SARS-CoV-St19/GFP). Partial deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of SARS-CoV S protein (SARS-CoV-St19) allowed efficient incorporation into the VSV particle that enabled the generation of a high titer of pseudotype virus. Neutralization assay with anti-SARS-CoV antibody revealed that VSV-SARS-St19/GFP pseudotype infection is mediated by SARS-CoV S protein. The VSV∆G∗/SEAP system, which secretes alkaline phosphatase instead of GFP, was also generated as a VSV pseudotype having SARS-CoV S protein (VSV-SARS-CoV-St19/SEAP). This system enabled high-throughput analysis of SARS-CoV S protein-mediated cell entry by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity. Thus, VSV pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S protein is useful for developing a rapid detection system for neutralizing antibody specific for SARS-CoV infection as well as studying the S-mediated cell entry of SARS-CoV.","Fukushi, Shuetsu; Watanabe, Rie; Taguchi, Fumihiro",SARS- and Other Coronaviruses,216,20

However, limited data are available on SARS-CoV-2 transmission from young children, particularly in child care settings (3). To better understand transmission from young children, contact tracing data collected from three COVID-19 outbreaks in child care facilities in Salt Lake County, Utah, during April 1-July 10, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed to explore attack rates and transmission patterns. A total of 184 persons, including 110 (60%) children had a known epidemiologic link to one of these three facilities. Among these persons, 31 confirmed COVID-19 cases occurred; 13 (42%) in children. Among pediatric patients with facility-associated confirmed COVID-19, all had mild or no symptoms. Twelve children acquired COVID-19 in child care facilities. Transmission was documented from these children to at least 12 (26%) of 46 nonfacility contacts (confirmed or probable cases). One parent was hospitalized. Transmission was observed from two of three children with confirmed, asymptomatic COVID-19. Detailed contact tracing data show that children can play a role in transmission from child care settings to household contacts. Having SARS-CoV-2 testing available, timely results, and testing of contacts of persons with COVID-19 in child care settings regardless of symptoms can help prevent transmission. CDC guidance for child care programs recommends the use of face masks, particularly among staff members, especially when children are too young to wear masks, along with hand hygiene, frequent cleaning and disinfecting of high-touch surfaces, and staying home when ill to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission (4).","Lopez, Adriana S.; Hill, Mary; Antezano, Jessica; Vilven, Dede; Rutner, Tyler; Bogdanow, Linda; Claflin, Carlene; Kracalik, Ian T.; Fields, Victoria L.; Dunn, Angela; Tate, Jacqueline E.; Kirking, Hannah L.; Kiphibane, Tair; Risk, Ilene; Tran, Cuc H.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,216,20

It is considered a potential causative agent of Merkel cell carcinoma, a life-threatening skin cancer. OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence of MCPyV in a large number of clinical samples of various types. Most of the samples were examined also for the other newly found polyomaviruses KI (KIPyV) and WU (WUPyV). STUDY DESIGN: Altogether 1390 samples from immunocompetent or immunocompromised patients, including (i) tonsillar tissues and sera from tonsillectomy patients; (ii) nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) and sera from wheezing children and (iii) nasal swabs, sera and stools from febrile leukemic children were studied for MCPyV. The tonsils, nasal swabs and stools were also studied for KIPyV and WUPyV. RESULTS: MCPyV DNA was detected in 14 samples altogether; 8 of 229 (3.5%) tonsillar tissues, 3 of 140 (2.1%) NPAs, 2 of 106 (1.9%) nasal swabs and 1 of 840 (0.1%) sera.

COVID-19 infection was identified by transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT- qPCR) of oral/nasal swabs together with clinical-review. Following correction for environmental contaminants, potential COVID-19 breath-biomarkers were identified by multi-variate analysis and comparison to GC-IMS databases. A COVID-19 breath-score based on the relative abundance of a panel of volatile organic compounds was proposed and tested against the cohort data. FINDINGS: Ninety-eight patients were recruited, of whom 21/33 (63.6%) and 10/65 (15.4%) had COVID-19 in Edinburgh and Dortmund, respectively. Other diagnoses included asthma, COPD, bacterial pneumonia, and cardiac conditions. Multivariate analysis identified aldehydes (ethanal, octanal), ketones (acetone, butanone), and methanol that discriminated COVID-19 from other conditions. An unidentified-feature with significant predictive power for severity/death was isolated in Edinburgh, while heptanal was identified in Dortmund. Differentiation of patients with definite diagnosis (25 and 65) of COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 was possible with 80% and 81.5% accuracy in Edinburgh and Dortmund respectively (sensitivity/specificity 82.4%/75%; area-under-the-receiver- operator-characteristic [AUROC] 0.87 95% CI 0.67 to 1) and Dortmund (sensitivity / specificity 90%/80%; AUROC 0.91 95% CI 0.87 to 1). INTERPRETATION: These two studies independently indicate that patients with COVID-19 can be rapidly distinguished from patients with other conditions at first healthcare contact. The identity of the marker compounds is consistent with COVID-19 derangement of breath-biochemistry by ketosis, gastrointestinal effects, and inflammatory processes. Development and validation of this approach may allow rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 in the coming endemic flu seasons.

METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted during the 2018 winter influenza season. Adult patients with fever/respiratory symptoms (fever/RS group) were age- and sex-matched with patients without fever/RS (non-fever/RS group) in a 1:1 ratio. Respiratory viruses were tested using NxTAG™ Respiratory Pathogen Panel IVD, a commercially-available multiplex PCR panel. RESULTS: A total of 214 acutely hospitalized patients were included in the final analysis, consisting of 107 with fever/RS (fever/RS group), and 107 age- and sex-matched patients without fever/RS (non-fever/RS group). Respiratory viruses were detected in 34.1% (73/214) of patients, and co-infection occurred in 7.9% (17/214) of patients. The incidence of respiratory virus was higher in the fever/RS group than in the non-fever/RS group (44.9% (48/107) versus 23.4% (25/107), p 0.001). Influenza B virus, enterovirus/rhinovirus and coronaviruses were detected more frequently in the fever/RS group, whereas parainfluenza virus 4B and adenovirus were detected more frequently in the non-fever/RS group. Among the non-fever/RS group, chest discomfort was more common among patients tested positive for respiratory viruses than those without respiratory virus detected (44% (11/25) versus 22% (18/82), p 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses can be frequently detected among hospitalized patients without typical features of respiratory tract infection. These patients may be a source of nosocomial outbreaks.","To, K.K.W.; Chan, K.-H.; Ho, J.; Pang, P.K.P.; Ho, D.T.Y.; Chang, A.C.H.; Seng, C.W.; Yip, C.C.Y.; Cheng, V.C.C.; Hung, I.F.N.; Yuen, K.-Y.",Clin Microbiol Infect,216,1

Signaling through this receptor is thought to influence the immune activity of microglia as well as monocytes egress from the bone marrow (BM) and their trafficking into the central nervous system (CNS) in several neurological diseases. During experimental herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis (HSE), CCR2 deficiency has been reported to exacerbate the outcome of the disease. However, the precise contribution of CCR2 expressed in cells of the CNS or peripheral monocytes in the protection against HSE remains unclear. To dissect the differential role of CCR2 during HSE, chimeric mice with receptor deficiency in the brain or blood cells were generated by transplanting wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 or CCR2(-/-) BM-derived cells in CCR2(-/-) (WT→CCR2(-/-)) and WT (CCR2(-/-)→WT) mice, respectively. Our results indicate that following intranasal infection with 1.2x10(6) plaque forming units of HSV-1, CCR2 deficiency in hematopoietic cells and, to a lesser extent, in CNS exacerbates the outcome of HSE. Mortality rates of CCR2(-/-) (71.4%) and CCR2(-/-)→WT (57.1%) mice were significantly higher than that of WT (15.3%; P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively) but the difference did not reach statistical significance for WT→CCR2(-/-) animals (42.8%; P = 0.16). Both peripheral and CNS deficiencies in CCR2 resulted in increased infectious viral titers and wider dissemination of HSV antigens in the brain as well as an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-1β, IL-6, CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5. Furthermore, CCR2 deficiency in the hematopoietic system altered monocytes egress from the BM and their recruitment to the CNS, which may contribute to the failure in HSV-1 containment. Collectively, these data suggest that CCR2 expressed on cells of CNS and especially on peripheral monocytes is important for the control of HSV-1 replication and inflammatory environment during experimental HSE.","Menasria, Rafik; Canivet, Coraline; Piret, Jocelyne; Gosselin, Jean; Boivin, Guy",PLoS One,216,20

A tuberculosis (TB) outbreak happened in Hubei Province during the COVID-19 pandemic. The transmission chain was probably from a father （MDR-TB case）with retreated TB history to his daughter, who then spread TB to her classmates. What are the implications for public health practice? We should enhance TB control both in schools and households, including strengthening TB/MDR-TB detection, health education, and ventilation. The TB contact screening cannot only be limited to outside school settings and should be conducted in the school when a TB student is absent from school for 2 or 3 months, or even longer especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Dan; Peng, Xiaowang; Hou, Shuangyi; Li, Tao; Yu, Xue-jie",China CDC Wkly,216,21

The technology of nursery depopulation (ND) appears to effectively control the spread of virus between members of endemically infected populations. ND consists of a strategic adjustment in pigflow based on the presence of specific serologic patterns as detected by the indirect fluorescent antibody test. This pattern indicates a low seroprevalence of antibodies detected in the breeding herd and recently weaned piglets (≤ 10%), in contrast to a high (> 50%) seroprevalence in 8 to 10 week old piglets. ND has been carried out on swine farms in the US and results indicate improvements in nursery piglet growth rate and mortality levels. Three examples are provided in the following text. Recently a modified live virus vaccine (RespPRRS, NOBL Laboratories/Boerhinger Ingleheim) has become commercially available. It is currently approved for use in piglets from 3 to 18 weeks of age; however, potential for the use in adult animals is currently under investigation.","Dee, Scott A.; Joo, HanSoo",Veterinary Microbiology,216,24

This disease affects the small air sacs (alveoli) in the lung and requires prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Chest X-rays are one of the most common tests used to detect pneumonia. In this work, we propose a real-time Internet of Things (IoT) system to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images. The dataset used has 6000 chest X-ray images of children, and three medical specialists performed the validations. In this work, twelve different architectures of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on ImageNet were adapted to operate as the resource extractors. Subsequently, the CNNs were combined with consolidated learning methods, such as k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results showed that the VGG19 architecture with the SVM classifier using the RBF kernel was the best model to detect pneumonia in these chest radiographs. This combination reached 96.47%, 96.46%, and 96.46% for Accuracy, F1 score, and Precision values, respectively. Compared to other works in the literature, the proposed approach had better results for the metrics used. These results show that this approach for the detection of pneumonia in children using a real-time IoT system is efficient and is, therefore, a potential tool to aid in medical diagnoses. This approach will allow specialists to obtain faster and more accurate results and thus provide the appropriate treatment.","Chagas, João Victor S. das; de A.

In inflammatory conditions, monocytes frequently show increased expression of CD169/Siglec-1, a type-I interferon (IFN-I)-regulated protein. However, little is known about the phenotype and function of these CD169(+) monocytes. Here, we have investigated the phenotype of human CD169(+) monocytes in different diseases, their capacity to activate CD8(+) T cells, and the potential for a targeted-vaccination approach. Using spectral flow cytometry, we detected CD169 expression by CD14(+) CD16(-) classical and CD14(+) CD16(+) intermediate monocytes and unbiased analysis showed that they were distinct from dendritic cells, including the recently described CD14-expressing DC3. CD169(+) monocytes expressed higher levels of co-stimulatory and HLA molecules, suggesting an increased activation state. IFNα treatment highly upregulated CD169 expression on CD14(+) monocytes and boosted their capacity to cross-present antigen to CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, we observed CD169(+) monocytes in virally-infected patients, including in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of COVID-19 patients, as well as in the blood of patients with different types of cancers. Finally, we evaluated two CD169-targeting nanovaccine platforms, antibody-based and liposome-based, and we showed that CD169(+) monocytes efficiently presented tumor-associated peptides gp100 and WT1 to antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. In conclusion, our data indicate that CD169(+) monocytes are activated monocytes with enhanced CD8(+) T cell stimulatory capacity and that they emerge as an interesting target in nanovaccine strategies, because of their presence in health and different diseases.","Affandi, Alsya J.; Olesek, Katarzyna; Grabowska, Joanna; Nijen Twilhaar, Maarten K.; Rodríguez, Ernesto; Saris, Anno; Zwart, Eline S.; Nossent, Esther J.; Kalay, Hakan; de Kok, Michael; Kazemier, Geert; Stöckl, Johannes; van den Eertwegh, Alfons J.

We investigated heart tissue by in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and RNA sequencing in consecutive autopsy cases to quantify virus load and characterize cardiac involvement in COVID-19. Methods Left ventricular tissue from 95 deceased with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing autopsy was analyzed and clinical data were collected. RNA was isolated to examine virus load of SARS-CoV-2 and its replication in the heart. A virus load >1000 copies per {micro}g RNA was defined as relevant. Viral RNA and inflammatory cells were assessed using histology. RNA sequencing and gene ontology (GO) enrichment were performed in 10 cases with high cardiac virus load and 10 age-matched cases without cardiac infection. Results A relevant SARS-CoV-2 virus load was detected in 41 out of 95 deceased (43%). The median cardiac virus load was 7952 copies per {micro}g RNA (IQR 2507, 32 005). In situ hybridization revealed SARS-CoV-2 RNA primarily in the interstitium or interstitial cells. Virus detection was not associated with increased inflammatory cells. Relevant cardiac infection was associated with increased expression of the entry factor TMPRSS2. Cardiac virus replication was found in 14/95 hearts (15%). Remarkably, cardiac virus replication was associated with shorter time between diagnosis and death. RNA sequencing revealed clear activation of immune response pathways to virus infection and destruction of cardiomyocytes. Hearts with high virus load showed activation of the GO term ''extracellular exosomes''.

The role of hMPV infections in all age groups in Thailand has not yet been investigated. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine prevalence of hMPV infection in all age groups in Thailand during 2011. METHODS: A total of 1,184 nasopharyngeal washes were collected from hospitalized patients and sent to the Department of Microbiology, Siriraj Hospital, for influenza A virus detection. Real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect hMPV infection. Partially, F gene from hMPV positive samples were sequenced and used for genotyping by phylogenetic tree analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of hMPV for all age groups was 6.3%. The highest prevalence of hMPV infection was in children aged <2 years. Of 71 hMPV‐positive patients, three (4.2%) were coinfected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), two with rhinovirus (2.8%), one with coronavirus (1.4%), and one with RSV and adenovirus (1.4%). Phylogenetic analysis of F gene revealed that 96.8% of hMPV detected was subgenotype B1, 1.6% was sublineage A2a, and 1.6% was A2b. Genetic variation of F gene was much conserved.

It is unknown whether state-of-the-art treatment has resulted in less thrombotic complications in the second wave. Methods We assessed the incidence of thrombotic complications and overall mortality in COVID-19 patients admitted to eight Dutch hospitals between September 1st and November 30th 2020. Follow-up ended at discharge, transfer to another hospital, when they died, or on November 30th 2020, whichever came first. Cumulative incidences were estimated, adjusted for competing risk of death. These were compared to those observed in 579 patients admitted in the first wave, between February 24th and April 26th 2020, by means of Cox regression techniques adjusted for age, sex and weight. Results In total 947 patients with COVID-19 were included in this analysis, of whom 358 patients were admitted to the ICU; 144 patients died (15%). The adjusted cumulative incidence of all thrombotic complications after 10, 20 and 30 days was 12% (95% confidence interval (CI) 9.8-15%), 16% (13-19%) and 21% (17-25%), respectively. Patient characteristics between the first and second wave were comparable. The adjusted hazard ratio for overall mortality in the second wave versus the first wave was 0.53 (95%CI 0.41-0.70). The adjusted HR for any thrombotic complication in the second versus the first wave was 0.89 (95%CI 0.65-1.2). Conclusions Mortality was reduced by 47% in the second wave, but the thrombotic complication rate remained high, and comparable to the first wave. Careful attention to provision of adequate thromboprophylaxis is invariably warranted.","Kaptein, F.H.J.; Stals, M.A.M.; Grootenboers, M.; Braken, S.J.E.; Burggraaf, J.L.I.; van Bussel, B.C.T.; Cannegieter, S.

The model is built on the principle that, the exponential rise and decay of the number of confirmed Covid-19 infections can be construed as a set of concurrent non-linear waves. These waves can be characterized by a linear combination of Gaussian and Cauchy Lorentz functions collectively termed as Gaussian-Lorentzian Composite (GLC) function.

The two viruses differ in their potential to cause disease. FeLV is more pathogenic, and was long considered to be responsible for more clinical syndromes than any other agent in cats. FeLV can cause tumors (mainly lymphoma), bone marrow suppression syndromes (mainly anemia), and lead to secondary infectious diseases caused by suppressive effects of the virus on bone marrow and the immune system. Today, FeLV is less commonly diagnosed than in the previous 20 years; prevalence has been decreasing in most countries. However, FeLV importance may be underestimated as it has been shown that regressively infected cats (that are negative in routinely used FeLV tests) also can develop clinical signs. FIV can cause an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome that increases the risk of opportunistic infections, neurological diseases, and tumors. In most naturally infected cats, however, FIV itself does not cause severe clinical signs, and FIV-infected cats may live many years without any health problems. This article provides a review of clinical syndromes in progressively and regressively FeLV-infected cats as well as in FIV-infected cats.","Hartmann, Katrin",Viruses,216,20

Here we examine the psychological and behavioral shifts over the initial stages of the outbreak in the United States in an observational longitudinal study. Through GPS phone data we find that homestay is increasing, while being at work dropped precipitously. Using regular real-time experiential surveys we observe an overall increase in stress and mood levels which is similar in size to the weekend vs. weekday differences. As there is a significant difference between weekday and weekend mood and stress levels, this is an important decrease in wellbeing.

The aim of this survey was to explore public knowledge and attitudes to CPR. Our hypotheses were that recent CPR training (< 5 years) would be associated with a high-quality response in a case vignette of OHCA with agonal breathing, and associated with an interest to become a smartphone app responder in suspected OHCA. METHODS: Data were collected through a web survey. Respondents (≥18 years) in Skåne County, Sweden were members of a panel created by a market research company. Data were weighted with respect to gender, age, municipalities and level of education to increase generalisability to the general population. RESULTS: A total of 1060 eligible answers were analysed. Seventy-six percent of non-healthcare professionals (n = 912) had participated in a CPR course at some time in life, 58 percent during the previous five years. The recommended CPR algorithm was known by 57 percent, whereas knowledge of the location of the nearest automated external defibrillator (AED) in a home environment was poor. Recent CPR training (< 5 years) did not favour high-quality response in a case vignette of OHCA with agonal breathing, but was one predictor of wanting to become a smartphone app responder. CONCLUSION: This study highlights possible areas of improvement in CPR training, which might improve OHCA identification and facilitate knowledge retention. The potential to recruit smartphone app responders seems promising in certain groups.","Andréll, Cecilia; Christensson, Camilla; Rehn, Liselott; Friberg, Hans; Dankiewicz, Josef",Resusc Plus,216,16

We first discuss historical précis of the concept of seasonal rounds that we apply to assess the spatial and temporal communal migrations and then describe current international research among Indigenous and rural communities in North America and Central Asia by the creation of a common vocabulary through mutual respect for multiple ways of knowing, validation of co-generated knowledge, and insights into seasonal change. By investigating the relationship between specific biophysical indicators and livelihoods of local communities, we demonstrate that seasonal rounds are an inclusive and participatory methodology that brings together diverse Indigenous and rural voices to anticipate anthropogenic climate change.

We have screened 333 natural oriental herbal medicines to search for new antiviral candidates against PEDV. We found that two herbal extracts, KIOM 198 and KIOM 124, contain significant anti-PED viral effect. KIOM 198 and KIOM 124 were identified as Epimedium koreanum Nakai and Lonicera japonica Thunberg, respectively. The further plaque and CPE inhibition assay in vitro showed that KIOM 198 has much stronger antiviral activity than KIOM 124. Additionally, KIOM 198 exhibited a similar extent of antiviral effect against other subtypes of Corona virus such as sm98 and TGE viruses. Cytotoxicity results showed that KIOM 198 is nontoxic on the cells and suggest that it can be delivered safely for therapy. Furthermore, when we orally administered KIOM 198 to piglets and then infected them with PEDV, the piglets did not show any disease symptoms like diarrhea and biopsy results showed clean intestine, whereas control pigs without KIOM 198 treatment exhibited PED-related severe symptoms. These results imply that KIOM 198 contains strong antiviral activity and has a potential to be developed as an antiviral phytomedicine to treat PEDV-related diseases in pigs.","Cho, Won-Kyung; Kim, Hyunil; Choi, Yu Jeong; Yim, Nam-Hui; Yang, Hye Jin; Ma, Jin Yeul",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,216,14

We previously described that the immunosuppressive tryptophan/kynurenine metabolite anthranilic acid correlates with poor prognosis in non-cancer patients. In cancer patients, we observed an elevation of anthranilic acid at baseline (without Covid-19 diagnosis) and no further increase with mild or severe Covid-19. We found that, in cancer patients, Covid-19 severity was associated with the depletion of two bacterial metabolites, indole-3-proprionate and 3-phenylproprionate, that both positively correlated with the levels of several inflammatory cytokines. Most importantly, we observed that the levels of acetylated polyamines (in particular N(1)-acetylspermidine, N(1),N(8)-diacetylspermidine and N(1),N(12)-diacetylspermine), alone or in aggregate, were elevated in severe Covid-19 cancer patients requiring hospitalization as compared to uninfected cancer patients or cancer patients with mild Covid-19. N(1)-acetylspermidine and N(1),N(8)-diacetylspermidine were also increased in patients exhibiting prolonged viral shedding (>40 days). An abundant literature indicates that such acetylated polyamines increase in the serum from patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease or neurodegeneration, associated with poor prognosis. Our present work supports the contention that acetylated polyamines are associated with severe Covid-19, both in the general population and in patients with malignant disease. Severe Covid-19 is characterized by a specific metabolomic signature suggestive of the overactivation of spermine/spermidine N(1)-acetyl transferase-1 (SAT1), which catalyzes the first step of polyamine catabolism.","Bourgin, Mélanie; Derosa, Lisa; Silva, Carolina Alves Costa; Goubet, Anne-Gaëlle; Dubuisson, Agathe; Danlos, François-Xavier; Grajeda-Iglesias, Claudia; Cerbone, Luigi; Geraud, Arthur; Laparra, Ariane; Aprahamian, Fanny; Nirmalathasan, Nitharsshini; Madeo, Frank; Zitvogel, Laurence; Kroemer, Guido; Durand, Sylvère",Aging (Albany NY),216,26

Data supporting alternate specimen types and freeze-thaw antibody stability is lacking. The stability of IgG and other immunoglobulins in multiple blood sample types stored in differing conditions and multiple freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: : Serum, plasma, and heparinized-plasma samples were collected from COVID-19 recovered individuals. Samples underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies upon collection, after each of 10-12 FTCs, and storage at -70°C, -20°C, 4°C, and room-temperature for 10-12 days using four high-throughput commercial assays, two rapid-test cassettes, a manual ELISA, and a surrogate neutralization assay. RESULTS: : All three specimen types were collected from 34 COVID-19 recovered seropositive individuals (≥21 days post-symptoms). Using the Architect and Liaison assays, a positive qualitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG result was detected daily up to 12 FTCs and up to 10 days of storage at different temperatures. An additional 25 plasma samples consistently demonstrated detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies daily after 12 FTCs and storage at -20°C using two rapid test cassette assays (SD Biosensor and Hangzhou All Test), manual (Beijing Wantai) and surrogate neutralization (GenScript) ELISAs, and two high-throughput assays (Roche Elecsys nucleocapsid and spike). IgM antibodies were less frequently detected by one of the rapid test cassette assays. CONCLUSIONS: : Serum, plasma, and heparinized-plasma constitute reliable samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection. In particular, the IgG response was stable and reliably detected after multiple FTCs and storage at common laboratory conditions. IgM detection was variable due to the labile nature of this antibody class.","Kanji, Jamil N; Bailey, Ashley; Fenton, Jayne; Lindsay, L.

Therefore, it is important to develop methods that will ensure that the COVID vaccine is allocated to the people who are at major risk until there is a sufficient global supply. Herein, I developed a machine-learning tool that could be applied to assess the risk in communities based on social, medical, and lifestyle risk factors. As a proof of concept, I modeled COVID risk in the Massachusetts communities using 29 risk factors, including the prevalence of preexisting comorbid conditions like COPD and social factors such as racial composition. Of the 29 factors, 14 were found to be significant (p < 0.1) indicators: poverty, food insecurity, lack of high school education, lack of health insurance coverage, premature mortality, population, population density, recent population growth, Asian percentage, high-occupancy housing, and preexisting prevalence of cancer, COPD, overweightness, and heart attacks. The machine-learning approach finds the 9 highest risk communities in the state of Massachusetts: Lynn, Brockton, Revere, Randolph, Lowell, New Bedford, Everett, Waltham, and Fitchburg. The 5 most at-risk counties are Suffolk, Middlesex, Bristol, Norfolk, and Plymouth. With appropriate data, the tool could evaluate risk in other communities, or even enumerate individual patient susceptibility.

Indeed, estimation of unreported infections is crucial for a better understanding of the current emergency in China and in other countries. In this study, we aimed to estimate the unreported number of infections in China prior to the 23 January 2020 restrictions. To do this, we developed a Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered–Dead (SEIRD) model that estimated unreported infections from the reported number of deaths. Our approach relied on the fact that observed deaths were less likely to be affected by ascertainment biases than reported infections. Interestingly, we estimated that the basic reproductive number (R(0)) was 2.43 (95%CI = 2.42–2.44) at the beginning of the epidemic and that 92.9% (95%CI = 92.5%–93.1%) of total cases were not reported. Similarly, the proportion of unreported new infections by day ranged from 52.1% to 100%, with a total of 91.8% (95%CI = 91.6%–92.1%) of infections going unreported. Agreement between our estimates and those from previous studies proves that our approach is reliable for estimating the prevalence and incidence of undocumented SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Healthy pregnant women are still not regarded as a susceptible group despite physiological changes that make pregnant women more vulnerable to severe infection. However, high-risk pregnancies may be associated with severe COVID-19 disease with respiratory failure, as outlined in this report. We discuss the importance of timely delivery and antenatal steroid administration in a critically ill patient. CASE: A 27-year-old pregnant woman (gravida 2, para 1) with type I diabetes, morbid obesity, hypothyroidism and a previous Caesarean section presented with critical respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 at 32 weeks of gestation. A preterm emergency Caesarean section was performed, after steroid treatment for foetal lung maturation. The patient benefited from prone positioning; however, transient acute renal injury, rhabdomyolysis and sepsis led to prolonged intensive care and mechanical ventilation for 30 days. The baby had an uncomplicated recovery. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection in high-risk pregnancies may result in severe maternal and neonatal outcomes such as critical respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and premature termination of the pregnancy. Antenatal steroids may be of benefit for foetal lung maturation but should not delay delivery in severe cases.","Kolkova, Zuzana; Bjurström, Martin F.; Länsberg, John-Kalle; Svedas, Eimantas; Hamer, Maria Andrada; Hansson, Stefan R.; Herbst, Andreas; Zaigham, Mehreen",Case Rep Womens Health,216,16

Methods An online survey was disseminated to adults (n = 8,425; 44.5 ± 14.8y) residing in the UK, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia within the first 2-6 weeks of government-mandated COVID-19 restrictions. Main outcome measures included: Stages of Change scale for exercise behaviour change; International Physical Activity Questionnaire (short-form); World Health Organisation-5 Well-being Index; and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-9. Results Participants who reported a negative change in exercise behaviour between pre-initial COVID-19 restrictions and during initial COVID-19 restrictions demonstrated poorer mental health and well-being compared to those demonstrating either a positive-or no change in their exercise behaviour (p < 0.001). Whilst women reported more positive changes in exercise behaviour, young people (18-29y) reported more negative changes (both p < 0.001). Individuals who had more positive exercise behaviours reported better mental health and well-being (p < 0.001). Although there were no differences in PA between countries, individuals in New Zealand reported better mental health and well-being (p < 0.001). Conclusion The initial COVID-19 restrictions have differentially impacted upon PA habits of individuals based upon their age and sex, and therefore have important implications for international policy and guideline recommendations.

These NPAs had already been tested for 22 respiratory pathogens (18 viruses and 4 bacteria), but we found that 16 NPAs (4.9%) were PjqPCR-positive, making P. jirovecii the fourth most prevalent of the 23 microorganisms in the screen. Eleven of the 16 PjqPCR-positive patients were immunocompromised, and five had underlying pulmonary conditions. Nine NPAs were also positive for another respiratory pathogen. Six had PjqPCR-positive induced sputa less than 3 days after the NPA procedure, and five were diagnosed with pneumocystis pneumonia (four with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders and one AIDS patient). In all six available pairs quantification of P. jirovecii DNA showed fewer copies in NPA than in induced sputum and three PjqPCR-negative NPAs corresponded to PjqPCR-positive bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, underscoring the fact that a negative PjqPCR screen does not exclude a diagnosis of pneumocystosis. Including P. jirovecii DNA detection to the panel of microorganisms included in screening tests used for febrile pneumonia may encourage additional investigations or support use of anti-pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients.","Guigue, Nicolas; Alanio, Alexandre; Menotti, Jean; Castro, Nathalie De; Hamane, Samia; Peyrony, Olivier; LeGoff, Jérôme; Bretagne, Stéphane",Med Mycol,216,11

We develop and test the hypothesis that when populations endogenously respond to risk this tradeoff disappears. Methods- We develop a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission where populations endogenously reduce contacts in response to risk of death. We estimate the model for 118 countries constituting 7.05 billion people and assess the existence of a tradeoff between saving lives and livelihoods. Results- We show that with endogenous responses communities go through three phases: rapid early outbreaks, control through initial response, and a longer period of quasi-equilibrium endemic infection with effective reproduction number (Re) fluctuating around one. Analytical characterization of this phase shows little tradeoff between contact reduction levels (underpinning economic costs) and death rates. Empirically estimating the model, we find no positive correlation (r = -0.241, p = 0.009) between (log) death rates and (normalized) contact levels across nations. While contact reduction levels are broadly similar across countries (5-95 percentile: 0.521-0.867 of pre-pandemic contacts), expected death rates vary greatly, by over two orders of magnitude (5-95 percentile: 0.03-17 deaths per million per day). Interpretation- Whether by choice or by the force of crippling death tolls, most societies will bring down interactions enough to contain SARS-CoV-2s spread. What we control is the severity of death toll required to compel us to act: greater responsiveness to risk can bring down deaths with no excess economic costs.","Rahmandad, H.; Lim, T. Y.",,216,1

We present our institution's efforts to address this problem as a model for a successful introductory curriculum into artificial intelligence in radiology titled AI-RADS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The course was based on a sequence of foundational algorithms in AI; these algorithms were presented as logical extensions of each other and were introduced as familiar examples (spam filters, movie recommendations, etc.). Since most trainees enter residency without computational backgrounds, secondary lessons, such as pixel mathematics, were integrated in this progression. Didactic sessions were reinforced with a concurrent journal club highlighting the algorithm discussed in the previous lecture. To circumvent often intimidating technical descriptions, study guides for these papers were produced. Questionnaires were administered before and after each lecture to assess confidence in the material. Surveys were also submitted at each journal club assessing learner preparedness and appropriateness of the article. RESULTS: The course received a 9.8/10 rating from residents for overall satisfaction. With the exception of the final lecture, there were significant increases in learner confidence in reading journal articles on AI after each lecture. Residents demonstrated significant increases in perceived understanding of foundational concepts in artificial intelligence across all mastery questions for every lecture. CONCLUSION: The success of our institution's pilot AI-RADS course demonstrates a workable model of including AI in resident education.","Lindqwister, Alexander L.; Hassanpour, Saeed; Lewis, Petra J.; Sin, Jessica M.",Acad Radiol,216,23

In parallel to the growing pandemic, alcohol sales grew in the USA, with people stockpiling alcohol. Alcohol‐induced blackouts are one particularly concerning consequence of heavy drinking, and the extent to which blackout prevalence may change in the context of a pandemic is unknown. The purpose of the current study is to describe the prevalence of publicly available tweets in the USA referencing alcohol‐induced blackouts prior to and during the COVID‐19 outbreak. DESIGN AND METHODS: We used Crimson Hexagon's ForSight tool to access all original English tweets written in the USA that referenced alcohol‐related blackouts in 2019 and 2020. Using infoveillance methods, we tracked changes in the number and proportion of tweets about blackouts. RESULTS: More alcohol‐related blackout tweets were written between 13 March and 24 April in 2020 than 2019. In addition, a greater proportion of all tweets referenced blackouts in 2020 than in 2019. In the period prior to the ‘stay at home’ orders (January to mid‐March), the proportion of blackout tweets were higher in 2020 than 2019. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that references to high‐risk drinking persist during the pandemic despite restrictions on large social gatherings. Given that the internet is a common source of information for COVID‐19, the frequent posting about blackouts during this period might normalise the behaviour. This is concerning because alcohol use increases susceptibility to COVID‐19, and alcohol‐related mortality can further tax hospital resources.","Ward, Rose Marie; Riordan, Benjamin C.; Merrill, Jennifer E.; Raubenheimer, Jacques",Drug Alcohol Rev,216,1

The Government of Ghana deployed an infrastructure in anticipation for a refined bauxite agreement with China. Ghana’s Government seeks to develop an integrated Bauxite-Aluminum Industry; however, several NGOs try to protect the Atewa Forest and propose that the area should be upgraded to a National Park. In this study, this conservation-exploitation conflict is analyzed from a political ecology perspective elaborating on who are the involved key actors, their relations and what strategies are used. Political ecology is about recognizing the power that actors have at the moment of deciding what, how, and where to conserve nature. Based on interviews done during fieldtrips in 2018, 2019 and 2020 complemented by an analysis of political documents, the identified strategies the NGOs are using in this conflict, can be described as demonstration and upscaling. The aim of this paper is to draw attention on the politicization of nature, in particular Atewa forest reserve and its bauxite resources.","Purwins, Sebastian",GeoJournal,216,22
